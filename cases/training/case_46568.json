    "summary": "<p>On May 5, 2025, seventeen states and the District of Columbia filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against President Donald Trump and numerous federal departments and agencies and their agency heads. They challenged the implementation of a Presidential Memorandum halting federal approvals of wind-energy development. They alleged that the memorandum and its implementation violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was initially assigned to Chief District Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV.</p>\r\n<p>On May 7, Alliance for Clean Energy (ACE) New York moved to intervene on behalf of the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) on May 12, and ACE filed their proposed motion for a PI that same day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, Judge Saylor recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge William G. Young. Two days later, Judge Young granted ACE New York's motion to intervene. They filed a complaint in intervention on May 21, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, the court held a hearing during which it collapsed both PI motions with a trial on the merits, and ordered that defendants' opposition to the motions be treated as a motion to dismiss. On June 10, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with substantially the same claims and parties as the first one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 18, following a hearing, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion to dismiss. The motion was granted as to the Plaintiff States' Counts 3, 4, and 5, and ACE NY's Counts 4, 5, and 6. It was denied as to the Plaintiff States' Counts 1 and 2, and ACE NY's Counts 1, 2, and 3. The Court found that both ACE NY and the Plaintiff States had standing, that the Agencies' indefinite pause on wind energy leasing and permitting constituted final agency action, and that the Wind Directive constituted a substantive rule subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. The Court further held that Plaintiffs' equitable, ultra vires, and constitutional claims largely overlapped with their APA claims, and dismissed the Department of Agriculture, Energy, and Treasury because the complaint did not contain specific allegations regarding those agencies' implementation of the Wind Directive's pause. Finally, the OSCLA citizen-suit claim was dismissed on the grounds that Plaintiffs had \"not pursued and/or briefed this claim.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum that, \ninter alia, categorically and indefinitely halted all federal approvals necessary for the development \nof offshore- and onshore-wind energy, pending an amorphous, redundant, extra-statutory, and \nmulti-agency review of unknown duration. Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer \nContinental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 3 of 101\n \n \nand Permitting Practices for Wind Projects, 90 Fed. Reg. 8363 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Wind Memo). \nAlthough the States do not concede the legality of any aspect of the Wind Memo, this case \nchallenges Section 2(a)’s halt on federal approvals for wind-energy projects (the Wind Directive). \n3.  Citing unspecified “legal deficiencies” and “inadequacies” in past federal wind-\nenergy reviews, the Wind Directive orders the heads of relevant federal agencies to relinquish their \ncongressionally-imposed responsibilities. It orders that Agency Defendants instead “shall not issue \nnew or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore-wind \nprojects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind \nleasing and permitting practices”—a review, grounded in no statute and duplicative of already \nrequired reviews, that is to be conducted by the Secretary of the Interior with six separate federal \nagencies. Id. at 8364. \n4.  The Wind Directive has stopped most wind-energy development in its tracks, \ndespite the fact that wind energy is a homegrown source of reliable, affordable energy that supports \nhundreds of thousands of jobs, creates billions of dollars in economic activity and tax payments, \nand supplies more than 10% of the country’s electricity.  \n5.  And the Wind Directive was issued the very same day President Trump declared a \n“National Energy Emergency,” purportedly brought on by the country’s alleged “insufficient \nenergy production,” to shore up the “inadequate energy supply” by facilitating the development of \n“a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy.” Exec. Order 14156, Declaring a National \nEnergy Emergency, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Energy Emergency Order); see also Exec. \nOrder 14154, Unleashing American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Unleashing Order) \n(“encourag[ing] energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 4 of 101\n \n \nas a global energy leader long into the future”). These and numerous other executive actions \nsimilarly encouraged domestic energy development—that is, all but wind and other renewable \nenergy—and also directed agencies to shortcut environmental reviews for other forms of energy—\nthe very same reviews the Wind Directive labels as inadequate as to wind energy.  \n6.  Since issuance of the Wind Directive, Agency Defendants have duly ceased all \nwind-energy project permitting and approval activities, and have even issued a stop-work order \ninvoking the Wind Directive to halt construction of an offshore wind project that previously had \nreceived all federal permits required for construction. \n7.  The wind-energy industry, like many other capital-intensive industries in and \nbeyond  the  energy  sector,  operates  in  a  tremendously  complex  logistical  and  regulatory \nenvironment, where even minor setbacks can dramatically increase costs and delay or even \naltogether derail wind-energy projects. Accordingly, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ \nactions implementing it create an existential threat to the wind industry. \n8.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on \nfederal  wind-energy  approvals  harms  the  States’  efforts  to  secure  reliable,  diversified,  and \naffordable sources of energy to meet the ever-increasing demand for electricity; their billions of \ndollars  in  investments  in  supply  chains,  workforce  development,  and  wind-industry-related \ninfrastructure, including transmission upgrades; and their statutory- and policy-based efforts to \nprotect public health and welfare from harmful air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulfur \ndioxide, as well as greenhouse-gas emissions.  \n9.  The various actions taken by Agency Defendants to implement the Wind Directive \nare arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). First, the Wind \nDirective was issued with no reasoned explanation for its categorical and indefinite halt of wind-\n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 5 of 101\n \n \nenergy development. Second, neither the Wind Directive nor Agency Defendants have offered any \ndetailed justification to explain the abrupt change in longstanding federal policy supporting the \ndevelopment of wind energy.  Indeed, one Agency Defendant had recently described wind energy \nas “a critical source of power generation, reliability, and decarbonization.” Jonah Ury et al., \nPathways  to  Commercial  Liftoff:  Offshore  Wind,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Energy,  at  11  (Apr.  2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A4KL-6Z3W. Nor have Agency Defendants provided any explanation for their \ndeparture—using the President’s newly-imposed, extra-statutory review requirement—from past \nfindings, based on numerous comprehensive assessments, that wind projects can proceed with \nminimal or mitigable adverse effects on the environment and other interests. Third, the Wind \nDirective and Agency Defendants took no account of the serious reliance interests the States have \ndeveloped as a result of the federal government’s long-running support for and approvals of wind-\nenergy development and its issuance of leases for offshore-wind generation facilities, which \ncontinued even during the first Trump administration. Finally, the Wind Directive not only was \ninternally inconsistent—proclaiming that the United States must provide “reliable,” “afford[able]” \nenergy to its residents as it hobbles a growing source of that energy, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363—but \nalso contradicted, without explanation, President Trump’s aforementioned Energy Emergency \nOrder  and  other  contemporaneous  executive  actions  calling  for  increased  domestic  energy \nproduction and curtailed environmental review. \n10.  Agency Defendants’ implementation of the Wind Directive is also contrary to and \nin excess of statutory authority under numerous federal statutes including the Clean Air Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), among others, \nwhich demand comprehensive, and prompt, permitting and approval proceedings.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 6 of 101\n \n \n11.  Further, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ actions implementing it are \nultra vires because no act of Congress authorizes the President or federal agencies to categorically \nand indefinitely halt approvals of wind-energy projects pending an extra-statutory review process. \n12.  Because  the  Wind  Directive  and  Agency  Defendants’  halt  on  wind-energy \napprovals are unlawful and jeopardize the continued development of a power source critical to the \nStates’ economic vitality, energy mix, public health, and climate goals, the States ask this Court to \ndeclare the Wind Directive unlawful and enjoin Agency Defendants from implementing it to halt \ndevelopment of wind-energy projects. \nPARTIES \n13.

Numerous statutes and their implementing regulations require Agency Defendants \nto consider and issue decisions on applications for wind-energy project approvals.  \n57.  These statutes include but are not limited to OCSLA, the Clean Water Act, the \nRivers and Harbors Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the \nEndangered  Species Act,  the  Bald  and  Golden  Eagle  Protection Act,  the  Marine  Mammal \nProtection Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the National \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 12 of 101\n \n \nHistoric Preservation Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), and the Fixing \nAmerica’s Surface Transportation Act. \n58.  Under these authorities, Agency Defendants must comprehensively, but promptly, \nreview, approve, deny, or otherwise act on applications to construct and operate wind-energy \nfacilities, following specific procedures and standards.  \nA.  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \n59.  OCSLA states that the Outer Continental Shelf is “a vital national resource reserve \nheld by the Federal Government for the public.” 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3). OCSLA directs DOI to \nfacilitate the Outer Continental Shelf’s “expeditious and orderly development” while maintaining \ncompetition and environmental safeguards. Id. \n60.  OCSLA allows the Interior Secretary to “grant a lease, easement, or right-of-way” \nfor activities that “produce or support production, transportation, storage, or transmission of energy \nfrom sources other than oil and gas,” including offshore wind. 43 U.S.C §§ 1337(p)(1)(C), 1356c.  \n61.  Once BOEM sells a commercial lease, a lessee must submit to BOEM a Site \nAssessment Plan for site-assessment activities and a Construction and Operations Plan for facility \nconstruction activities. 30 C.F.R. § 585.600. BOEM must then process these documents by \nreviewing them and either approving, disapproving, or requesting revisions. See id. §§ 585.613; \n585.628; 585.648.  \n62.  OCSLA does not authorize agencies to cease permitting for issued wind leases. \nB.  The Clean Water Act  \n \n63.  Under  Section  404  of  the  Clean Water Act,  33  U.S.C.  §  1344,  wind-energy \ndevelopers must obtain a permit from the Corps before discharging dredge-and-fill material into \nwaters of the United States, id. §§ 1344(a), 1362(7). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 13 of 101\n \n \n64.  When processing Section 404 permits, the Corps must issue public notice within \n15 calendar days of a complete application and issue a decision within 60 days unless additional \ninformation is needed. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(d). \n65.  Section 404 also mandates that the Corps minimize permitting delays, requiring \ndecisions on a dredge-and-fill permit application “to the maximum extent practicable . . . not later \nthan the ninetieth day after the date the notice for such application is published.” 33 U.S.C. \n§ 1344(q). \n66.  The  Corps’s  regulations  in  turn  prioritize  wind  and  other  energy  projects, \nclassifying them as a “major national objective” and giving the processing of their permit \napplications “high priority.” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(n). \n67.  The Clean Water Act also provides that any entity—including a wind-energy \ndeveloper—who plans to discharge pollutants from a point source into waters of the United States \nmust first obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. 33 U.S.C. \n§§ 1311, 1342.  \n68.  Once it receives a NPDES permit application, EPA or a state agency with delegated \nNPDES permitting authority must determine within 30 days whether the application is complete \nand thereafter prepare a draft permit and solicit public comment before issuing a final permit. \n40 C.F.R. §§ 124.3(c); 124.10(a); 124.11–124.12. \nC.  The Rivers and Harbors Act  \n \n69.  Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 bars construction, excavation, or \nmodification of waterways unless authorized by the Corps through permits issued under Section 10 \nof the Act. 33 U.S.C. § 403; 33 C.F.R. § 320.2(b). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 14 of 101\n \n \n70.  Under OCSLA, Section 10 permits (either individual or nationwide) are required \nfor “devices” and associated infrastructure such as offshore-wind turbines and cables. 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1333(e); see also id. § 1333(a)(1)(A)(iii)–(iv). \n71.  For individual Section 10 permits, the Corps must, among other things, notify \napplicants of incomplete applications within 15 calendar days; issue public notice within 15 days \nof receipt of a complete application; and decide applications within 60 days, unless additional \ninformation is needed. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2. \n72.  For nationwide permits, if the Corps doesn’t respond to a complete pre-construction \nnotification within 45 days, the activity is automatically authorized by the nationwide permit. \nReissuance and Modification of Nationwide Permits, 86 Fed. Reg. 73,522 (Dec. 27, 2021). \n73.  The Corps’s regulations recognize that “energy conservation and development are \nmajor national objectives” and provide that “[d]istrict engineers will give high priority to the \nprocessing of permit actions involving energy projects.” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(n). \nD.  The Clean Air Act \n74.  The  Clean Air Act  requires  EPA  to  establish  National Ambient Air  Quality \nStandards  (NAAQS)  and  classify  air-quality-control  regions  as  attainment  or  nonattainment \nregions based on NAAQS compliance. 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(1)(A)–(B). \n75.  New “major” sources of air pollution must obtain a Prevention of Significant \nDeterioration permit in attainment areas or a Nonattainment New Source Review permit in \nnonattainment areas before construction. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7475(a), 7502(c)(5). \n76.  For activities on the Outer Continental Shelf, such as offshore wind, Clean Air Act \nregulations require EPA to count emissions from certain associated vessels when determining if a \nsource is “major.” 40 C.F.R. § 55.2; see 42 U.S.C. § 7627. And the permit type for an offshore-\nwind facility depends on the nearest onshore area’s attainment status. 40 C.F.R. § 55.5.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 15 of 101\n \n \n77.  The Clean Air Act requires permitting authorities to issue permit decisions within \none year of receiving an application for a Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit and within \n18 months of receiving an application for a Nonattainment New Source Review permit. 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 7475(c), 7661b(c). \n78.  EPA regulations set additional timelines. See 40 C.F.R. § 71.5(a)(2). \nE.  The National Environmental Policy Act  \n79.  NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the effects of proposed major federal \nactions on the human environment. 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. \n80.  NEPA  requires  each  agency  to  draft  a  “detailed  statement”—called  an \nenvironmental  impact  statement—for  every  proposed  “major  Federal  action[]  significantly \naffecting the quality of the human environment” that analyzes the action’s reasonable foreseeable \nenvironmental effects, the effects that cannot be avoided, and a range of alternatives to the action, \namong other elements. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(i)–(iii).   \n81.  NEPA applies to most federal permitting requirements including Outer Continental \nShelf and federal land leasing; OCSLA Construction and Operations Plan (and sometimes Site \nAssessment Plan) approvals; Endangered Species Act incidental-take determinations; Clean Air \nAct approvals; and Clean Water Act approvals. \n82.  In 2023, Congress passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, amending NEPA to impose \nstrict  deadlines.  Now,  the  lead  agency  “shall  complete”  an  environmental  assessment  (the \nassessment required under NEPA to determine whether a project’s effects are so significant as to \nrequire preparation of a full environmental impact statement) not later than one year after certain \nconditions are met, and “shall complete” an environmental impact statement not later than two \nyears after those conditions are met. 42 U.S.C. § 4336a(g). Those deadlines can be extended only \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 16 of 101\n \n \nby “so much additional time as is necessary to complete such environmental impact statement or \nenvironmental assessment.” Id. \nF.  The Endangered Species Act  \n83.  Under the Endangered Species Act, each federal agency must “insure that any \naction authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued \nexistence” of any endangered or threatened species “or result in the destruction or adverse \nmodification of habitat” the Secretary of Interior determines to be critical. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2); \nsee Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 158 (1997). \n84.  Federal agencies must consult with USFWS or NMFS (collectively, Services), and \nthe relevant Service must issue a written biological opinion regarding how the activity—wind-\nenergy development, for example—will impact the listed species or critical habitat. 16 U.S.C. \n§ 1536(b)(3)(A). \n85.  Consultation must conclude promptly, “within 90 days after its initiation unless \nextended,” and the relevant Service must complete the biological opinion within 45 days thereafter. \n50 C.F.R. § 402.14(e). \n86.  If the relevant Service determines the activity will jeopardize a species’s ongoing \nexistence or destroy critical habitat, the biological opinion must include “reasonable and prudent \nalternatives” to avoid that consequence. Id. § 402.14(g)(5). \n87.  Alternately, if the Services find the action may only cause incidental impacts, the \nrelevant Service must issue an incidental-take statement that identifies the species impacts, \nincorporates  minimization  measures,  and  sets  forth  requirements  the  agency  must  follow. \n16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(4); see also Bennett, 520 U.S. at 158. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 17 of 101\n \n \n88.  The Endangered Species Act also provides for incidental-take permits for otherwise \nunlawful takes without a federal nexus if the applicant for such a permit, like a wind-energy \ndeveloper, obtains an approved conservation plan. 16 U.S.C. § 1539(a)(1)(B). \n89.  Upon receipt of an incidental-take application, USFWS or NMFS follow specific \nnotice-and-comment procedures and issue the permit if the applicable requirements are met. Id. \n§ 1539(a)(2)(B); 50 C.F.R. Parts 13, 17, 222, 402. \n90.  USFWS must timely process complete applications and render permit decisions. \n50 C.F.R. § 17.22(b)(1)–(2). NMFS must process applications “in the shortest possible time” and \nissue permits unless specific findings bar approval. Id. §§ 222.302(b), 222.303(e). \nG.  The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act  \n91.  The Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act prohibits the take—i.e., harming, killing, \nor disturbing—of bald or golden eagles without a permit issued by USFWS. 16 U.S.C. § 668. \n92.  The Act allows USFWS to authorize a bald or golden eagle take for disturbance \n(either an incidental take or nest removal) if it is compatible with eagle preservation. Id. § 668a; \nsee 50 C.F.R. § 22.280. \n93.  USFWS must issue a general incidental-take permit for an activity, such as a wind-\nenergy project, if (1) the activity is necessary to protect a legitimate interest; (2) the take is not the \nactivity’s purpose; and (3) the take cannot practicably be avoided. 50 C.F.R. §§ 22.210(d), 22.250. \n94.  Wind-energy projects that are ineligible for a general permit may request a letter of \nauthorization to apply for a specific permit according to specific criteria. Id. § 22.200(b)(7).  \n95.  USFWS is to process all applications for Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act \npermits “as quickly as possible.” 50 C.F.R. § 13.11. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 18 of 101\n \n \nH.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act \n96.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act generally prohibits the take of a marine \nmammal or any attempt to do so. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1371(a), 1362(13). \n97.  The Commerce and Interior Secretaries, however, can authorize the incidental take \nof  a  small  number  of  marine  mammals  from  commercial  activities,  such  as  wind-energy \ndevelopment. Id. § 1371(a)(5)(A).  \n98.  The Secretaries “shall allow” an incidental take if it will have a “negligible impact” \non the species and no “unmitigable adverse impact” on subsistence uses of the species. Id.  \n99.  If an incidental take is authorized, the relevant Secretary must then issue regulations \non permissible take methods and measures to minimize harm—especially to critical habitats—and \nset monitoring and reporting requirements. 16 U.S.C. § 1371(a)(5)(A).  \n100.  The Services are to process all applications for Marine Mammal Protection Act \npermits “as quickly as possible.” 50 C.F.R. § 13.11. \nI.  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n101.  The  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Act  requires \nfederal  agencies  to  consult  with  NMFS  “with  respect  to  any  action  authorized,  funded,  or \nundertaken” or proposed “by such agency that may adversely affect any essential fish habitat” \nunder the Act. 16 U.S.C. § 1855(b)(2). \n102.  Implementing regulations require the lead agencies to provide NMFS “with a \nwritten  assessment  of  the  effects  of  that  action  on  [essential  fish  habitat].”  50  C.F.R. \n§ 600.920(e)(1).  \n103.  NMFS must respond to the lead agency within 30 days of receiving its essential-\nfish-habitat assessment. Id. § 600.920(h)(4). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 19 of 101\n \n \nJ.  The National Historic Preservation Act \n104.  The National Historic Preservation Act requires the lead federal agency “having \ndirect or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed Federal or federally assisted undertaking in any \nState,” including license issuance, to “take into account the effect” that approving a proposed \nproject may have “on any historic property.” 54 U.S.C. § 306108. The Act gives the Advisory \nCouncil on Historic Preservation has opportunity to comment. Id.  \n105.  The Act can be triggered if a project may have an effect on either a listed or eligible \nhistoric property, which can include shipwrecks, historic buildings, and historic landmarks. \nK.  The Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n106.  FLPMA governs BLM and the Interior Secretary’s administration of onshore public \nlands. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq.  \n107.  The Act mandates that the Secretary develop, maintain, revise, and manage public \nlands in accordance with resource-management plans, 43 U.S.C §§ 1712(a), 1732(a); 43 C.F.R. \n§ 1610.5-3. In a resource-management plan, BLM, the Secretary’s FLPMA designee, can designate \nsections of public lands as open or closed for certain uses, including rights-of-way for the \nproduction of wind energy. 43 C.F.R. § 1610.1. \n108.  Specific procedures, like Federal Register and congressional notification, govern \nthe withdrawal of future uses of land including rights of way for wind-energy production. \n43 U.S.C. § 1714(a), (b)(1), (e).  \n109.  BLM may only deny a right-of-way application for specific reasons detailed in \nBLM regulations. 43 C.F.R. § 2804.26. And before suspending a right-of-way, holders of the right \nmust receive written notice and time to comply. 43 U.S.C. § 1766.  \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 20 of 101\n \n \nL.  The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act \n110.  The  Fixing  America’s  Surface  Transportation  Act  streamlines  environmental \nreview  and  permitting  for  covered  infrastructure  projects—including  wind-energy  projects. \n42 U.S.C. §§ 4370m et seq. \n111.  The Act requires the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council to maintain \nan online permitting dashboard following strict protocols to track federal environmental review \nand approval timelines. Id. § 4370m–2(b). \n112.  All federal agencies must adhere to permitting timelines. Id. § 4370m–2(c). If an \nagency anticipates missing or misses a deadline, it must notify the Council’s Executive Director, \npropose a new completion date, and submit status reports to the Executive Director until the agency \nhas taken final action on the delayed authorization or review. Id. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Federal  Agencies  Have  Long  Encouraged  and  Thoroughly  Assessed  the \nDevelopment of Wind Energy  \n \n113.  The development of both onshore- and offshore-wind energy has long enjoyed \nbipartisan support.  \n114.  President George W. Bush celebrated the fact that wind energy had increased by \nmore than 400% between 2001 and 2007.  \n115.  President Barack Obama oversaw a tripling of the amount of wind power generated \nin the United States, due in part to the $90 billion invested in renewable energy as part of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in 2009.  \n116.  President  Trump’s  first  administration  conducted  seven  offshore  wind  lease \nauctions,  granted  multiple  leases  to  offshore-wind  energy  developers,  and  moved  forward \nenvironmental reviews of proposed wind projects.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 21 of 101\n117.  President Joe Biden signed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which provided clean-\nenergy tax credits that are expected to help add, on average, 24 gigawatts of onshore wind energy \nper  year  by  2030. The  Biden  administration  pledged  that  the  United  States  would  deploy \n30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. By the time President Biden left office, Agency Defendants \nhad approved 15 gigawatts of offshore wind, and the industry had attracted billions in investment.  \n118.  Agency Defendants conducted extensive evaluation of wind-energy projects before \ngranting approvals under the statutory authorities described above.  \n119.  For example, NMFS studied the impacts of offshore wind on the North Atlantic \nright whale, as required under the Endangered Species Act. NMFS, North Atlantic Right Whale 5-Year \nReview: Summary and Evaluation, at 24–25 (Nov. 2022), https://perma.cc/62QZ-6XTE. Just last year, \nUSFWS studied the impacts of wind projects on eagles in connection with its revision of the rules \ngoverning  incidental  take.  USFWS,  Final  Environmental  Assessment,  2024  Eagle  Take Permit \nRulemaking, 170–82 (Feb. 2024), https://perma.cc/5W4T-HY77. Biological Opinions for individual \nwind projects have incorporated numerous mitigation measures to protect marine life. North Atlantic \nRight Whale 5-Year Review, supra, at 24–25. And environmental impact statements for  existing \nprojects have also extensively studied wildlife impacts. See, e.g., BOEM, Revolution Wind Farm and \nRevolution  Wind  Cable  Export  Project  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  3.15-1–3.15-7, \nE1-45–E1-80,  F-24–F-36,  F-55–F-67,  G-242–G-243  (2023),  https://perma.cc/\nFS8W-4C55. \n120.  Agency Defendants have also already studied wind energy’s impacts on the fishing \nindustry and addressed in detail ways to mitigate those impacts. See, e.g., BOEM, Atlantic Shores \nOffshore  Wind  South  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement, App.  G  at  14  (2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/5W6S-JH9P; BOEM, Record of Decision: Vineyard Wind 1 Offshore Wind Energy \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 22 of 101\nProject Construction and Operations Plan (Vineyard Wind ROD), at 42–43 (May 10, 2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/NL5V-DVDF. Agency Defendants’ findings have even shown that offshore wind \nmay benefit the fishing industry, including the artificial-reef effect from the turbine structures and \nthe discharge of fill material that could create new fish habitat. See BOEM, Record of Decision: \nAtlantic Shores Offshore Wind South Project Construction and Operations Plan (Atlantic Shores \nCOP ROD), at 22 (July 1, 2024), https://perma.cc/HQ7P-ZY56; Vineyard Wind ROD, supra, at \n36, 39. \n121. Likewise, Agency Defendants have thoroughly reviewed the economic impacts of\nwind energy, both generally and with regard to specific projects. As a result of those reviews, \nAgency Defendants have concluded that already-permitted offshore-wind projects would have \nlittle or no impact on local tourism industries. See, e.g., BOEM, Record of Decision: Empire \nOffshore Wind: Empire Wind Project (EW1 and EW2) Construction and Operations Plan, at 28 \n(Nov. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/JQE9-Q2AM. And Agency Defendants have also relied on \nmultiple studies concluding there is no evidence showing wind farms negatively impact property \nvalues. See, e.g., BOEM, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind South Final Environmental Impact \nStatement  Appendix  F  (Atlantic  Shores  FEIS  Appendix  F),  at  3.6.3-21  (2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/KS2Z-EUXB  (relying  on  these  studies  to  determine  the  project  will  have \nnegligible to minor impacts on property value). In fact, Agency Defendants have found that wind \nprojects will benefit the economy. See Atlantic Shores FEIS Appendix F, supra, at 3.6.3-26; id. at \n3.6.3-16 (noting study finding that “every $1.00 spent building an offshore-wind farm is estimated \nto generate $1.83 for New Jersey’s economy”); id. at 3.6.3-18 (wind development supports port \nemployment and surrounding businesses, especially during construction); BOEM, Record of \nDecision: Revolution Wind Farm and Revolution Wind Export Cable Project Construction and \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 23 of 101\n \n \nOperations Plan, at 16 (Aug. 21, 2023) (preferred alternative expected to have beneficial economic \nimpacts), https://perma.cc/HZ36-WMSH.  \n122.  Multiple courts have determined that federal permitting agencies have fulfilled their \nstatutory obligations, and in these cases have not found any legal deficiencies or inadequacies in \nenvironmental review. See, e.g., Seafreeze Shoreside, Inc. v. DOI, 123 F.4th 1 (1st Cir. 2024); \nNantucket Residents Against Turbines v. BOEM, 100 F.4th 1 (1st Cir. 2024), cert. denied sub nom. \nNantucket Residents v. BOEM, No. 24-337, 2025 WL 76449 (U.S. Jan. 13, 2025); Comm. for a \nConstructive Tomorrow v. DOI, No. CV 24-774 (LLA), 2024 WL 2699895 (D.D.C. May 24, 2024); \nPub. Emps. for Env’t Resp. v. Beaudreau, 25 F. Supp. 3d 67 (D.D.C. 2014). \n123.  Agency Defendants have also comprehensively reviewed onshore-wind-energy \nprojects. \n124.  As one example, BLM issued a programmatic environmental-impact statement \nregarding the impacts of wind-energy development on roughly 20 million acres of public lands in \n11 western states, including several of the State parties to this complaint. BLM concluded that \n“[e]ffective mitigation measures could be implemented to address many of the direct and indirect \nadverse impacts that could occur” and that “[t]he potential impacts of wind-energy development \non  local  and  regional  economies  would  be  largely  beneficial.”  BLM,  Final  Programmatic \nEnvironmental Impact Statement on Wind Energy Deployment on BLM-Administered Lands in the \nWestern United States, at ES-5 (June 2005), https://perma.cc/L9D9-E26Z. \n125.  BLM  also  determined  that  granting  rights-of-way  for  wind-energy  projects \n“contributes to the public interest in developing renewable energy to meet Federal and state goals.” \nBLM,  ROD  Tule  Wind  Project  Decision  to  Grant  Right-of-Way,  at  2  (Dec.  2011), \nhttps://perma.cc/J56V-2T6Q. BLM has found that project terms and conditions “will ensure” that \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 24 of 101\n \n \nonshore-wind-energy  projects  “will  protect  environmental  resources  and  comply  with \nenvironmental standards.” Id. \n126.  Courts also have upheld these environmental reviews and analyses of onshore-wind \nprojects. See, e.g., Protect our Cmtys. Found. v. Salazar, No. 12CV2211-GPC PCL, 2013 WL \n5947137 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2013), aff’d sub nom. Backcountry Against Dumps v. Jewell, 674 F. \nApp’x 657 (9th Cir. 2017); Protect Our Cmtys. Found. v. Jewell, 825 F.3d 571 (9th Cir. 2016). \nB.  President  Trump  and  Agency  Defendants  Reversed  Longstanding  Policy  by \nHalting Wind-Energy Development Despite Promoting Other Domestic Energy \nProduction \n \n127.  President  Trump  issued  the  Wind  Memo—including  the  Wind  Directive’s \ncategorical and indefinite halt on wind-energy approvals—on January 20, 2025. \n128.  The Wind Directive reverses the robust federal support for wind energy that had \nspanned decades and multiple administrations, does not account for Agency Defendants’  extensive \npast  federal  review  of  wind  development,  and  conflicts  with  President Trump  and Agency \nDefendants’ concurrent promotion of domestic energy production, both as a general matter and \nspecifically in several of our States. \n129.  In Section 1, despite citing “the country’s growing demand for reliable energy,” the \nWind Directive indefinitely prohibits new wind-energy leasing but assures that it does not affect \n“rights under existing leases.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363. \n130.  Section 2(a) of the Wind Memo—the Wind Directive at issue in this case—\nprohibits Agency Defendants from issuing “new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, \nleases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects” until “the completion of a comprehensive \nassessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices.” Id. at 8364. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 25 of 101\n \n \n131.  The Wind Directive orders that halt “[i]n light of various alleged legal deficiencies \nunderlying the Federal Government's leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects, \nthe consequences of which may lead to grave harm—including negative impacts on navigational \nsafety interests, transportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and \nmarine mammals,” as well as alleged “potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews” \nunder NEPA. Id. \n132.  The Secretary of the Interior must conduct the new extra-statutory assessment, the \nWind Directive commands, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of \nAgriculture,  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  through  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric \nAdministration, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Id. \n133.  And  despite  the  extensive  past  reviews  of  wind-energy  projects  by Agency \nDefendants—indeed,  ignoring  the  existence  of  these  reviews—the  Directive  orders  that  the \nassessment consider anew “the environmental impact of onshore and offshore-wind projects upon \nwildlife” and the “economic costs associated with the intermittent generation of electricity.” Id.  \n134.  The Wind Directive provides no time frame for completion of that open-ended \nassessment.  \n135.  Section 2(c) also requires the Interior Secretary to report to the President on “the \nenvironmental impact and cost to surrounding communities of defunct and idle windmills.” Id.  \n136.  The Wind Directive also conflicts with Defendants’ simultaneous promotion of \ndomestic energy production in various Executive Orders and other actions.  \n137.  For example, President Trump issued the Wind Directive indefinitely stalling wind-\nenergy approvals within hours of issuing two executive orders that emphasized the need for \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 26 of 101\n \n \ndomestic energy production and ordered agencies to expedite and curtail environmental reviews \nfor other forms of energy. \n138.  In the Energy Emergency Order, President Trump declared a “national emergency” \nallegedly brought on by “insufficient energy production” constituting an allegedly “extraordinary \nthreat to our Nation’s economy, national security, and foreign policy.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8434. The \nEnergy Emergency Order announced measures purporting to encourage the development of “a \nreliable,  diversified,  and  affordable  supply  of  energy,”  but  excluded  wind  energy  from  its \ndefinitions. Id. at 8433. The announced measures specifically included “identify[ing] obstacles to \ndomestic energy infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA or the Marine \nMammal Protection Act” and developing “procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements” \n(while the Wind Directive simultaneously invokes claimed inadequacies of reviews and approvals \nunder such authorities to altogether halt wind-energy development). Id. at 8436. The Order also \nsingled out Northeastern and West Coast states for allegedly causing a deficient U.S. energy supply \nand further directed agencies to “use all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to \nfacilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy” in these states. Id. at 8434. \n139.  The Day 1 Unleashing Order similarly proclaimed that it is “the policy of the United \nStates” to “encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including \non the Outer Continental Shelf.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8353. Like the Energy Emergency Order, this \norder excluded wind as a source of energy to be expanded. Id. at 8354. \n140.  More recently, President Trump issued multiple executive orders bolstering the coal \nindustry, claiming that, “in order to ensure adequate and reliable electric generation in America, to \nmeet growing electricity demand, and to address the national emergency declared pursuant to [the \nEnergy  Emergency  Order],  our  electric  grid  must  utilize  all  available  power  generation \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 27 of 101\n \n \nresources.” Exec. Order 14262, Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the National Electric \nGrid, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,521 (Apr. 14, 2025) (Grid Reliability Order) (emphasis added) (ordering \ncertain energy-generation resources to remain online); see also id. at 15,521 (“The United States’ \nability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy \nfrom all available electric generation sources . . . .” (emphasis added)); Exec. Order 14261, \nReinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive Order 14241, \n90 Fed. Reg. 15,517 (Apr. 14, 2025) (Reinvigorating Coal Order) (“[I]n order to secure America’s \neconomic prosperity and national security, lower the cost of living, and provide for increases in \nelectrical  demand  from  emerging  technologies,  we  must  increase  domestic  energy \nproduction . . . .” (emphasis added)).  \n141.  These and other Executive Orders and actions between January 20, 2025, and the \npresent emphasized the need for expedited domestic energy development—but not wind energy—\nand ordered agencies to altogether skip or otherwise curtail the very environmental reviews that \nthe Wind Directive invokes to block wind energy. See, e.g., Exec. Order 14270, Zero-Based \nRegulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,643 (Apr. 15, 2025) (Zero-\nBased Budgeting Order) (ordering agencies to sunset regulations governing environmental reviews \nthat impact energy development); see also Exec. Order 14153, Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary \nResource Potential, 90 Fed. Reg. 8347 (Jan. 29, 2025) (announcing policy to “expedite the \npermitting and leasing of energy and natural resource projects in Alaska”); Reinvigorating Coal \nOrder, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,517 (Apr. 14, 2025) (ordering Secretary of Interior, inter alia, to “identify[] \nopportunities to provide for expedited environmental reviews” of coal mining); Proclamation \n10914 of Apr. 8, 2025, Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American \nEnergy, 90 Fed. Reg. 16,777 (Apr. 21, 2025) (exempting coal-fired generation from 2024 mercury \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 28 of 101\n \n \nair toxics standards); Exec. Order 14285, Unleashing America’s Offshore Critical Minerals and \nResources, 90 Fed. Reg. 17,735 (Apr. 24, 2025) (directing Secretary of Interior to “establish an \nexpedited process for reviewing and approving permits for prospecting and granting leases for \nexploration, development, and production of seabed mineral resources within the United States \nOuter Continental Shelf”). Agency Defendants took the commands to heart; indeed, Defendant \nDOI recently announced expedited permitting for nearly all forms of domestic energy production \nexcept wind energy. See DOI, Press Release: Department of the Interior Implements Emergency \nPermitting Procedures to Strengthen Domestic Energy Supply. \nC.  Agency Defendants Have Adopted the Wind Directive’s Indefinite and Categorical \nHalt on Wind-Energy Approvals \n \n142.  Since January 20, 2025, Agency Defendants have adopted and implemented the \nWind Directive to indefinitely and categorically halt wind-energy approvals.  \n143.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Agency  Defendants  have  ceased  all  pending \napprovals necessary for construction of wind-energy projects. \n144.  The implications for individual projects and the States have become increasingly \nclear over the past several months, resulting in irreparable and mounting harms to the States.  \n145.  For example, on January 20, 2025, the same day the Wind Directive was issued, \nActing  Secretary  of  the  Interior Walter  Cruickshank  suspended  delegations  of  authority  to \n“Department  Bureaus  and  Offices”  to  “issue  any  onshore  or  offshore  renewable  energy \nauthorization, including but not limited to a lease, amendment to a lease, right of way, amendment \nto a right of way, contract, or any other agreement required to allow for renewable energy \ndevelopment.”  Walter  Cruickshank,  Order  No.  3415,  Temporary  Suspension  of  Delegated \nAuthority (Jan. 20, 2025), https://perma.cc/N4X8-8JQF. DOI revised this secretarial order on \nJanuary 29, restoring all but five of the delegations of authority, but the suspension of delegation \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 29 of 101\n \n \nof authority for offshore renewable-energy development remained in place during the effective \nperiod of that Secretarial Order.  \n146.  The next day, a NOAA representative informed an offshore-wind developer that its \nMarine Mammal Protection Act incidental-take authorization was subject to the Wind Directive’s \npause. NOAA indicated the pause to any new permits for this developer’s project would last \n90 days. NOAA indicated the need for a 90-day delay to issue the developer’s permit as a result of \nthe Wind Directive. \n147.  Just three days later, on January 24, the USFWS website provided the following \nnotice to eagle incidental-take permit applicants:  \nThe  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  pursuant  to  Presidential  Memorandum \n‘Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore \nWind Leading and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting \nPractices for Wind Projects’ is temporarily ceasing issuance of permits to wind \nfacilities until further notice.  \n \nUSFWS,  3-200-71:  Eagle  Incidental  Take  (General  Permit),  https://perma.cc/HC9J-\nUMND. \n148.  On January 28, BOEM postponed virtual public meetings on its draft Programmatic \nEnvironmental Impact Statement for Potential Mitigation of Future Development of Wind Lease \nAreas Offshore California, stating in the postponement notice posted on its website that: \nThe Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are \nimplementing the Administration’s Presidential Memorandum (PM) temporarily \nhalting offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. The PM also pauses \nnew or renewed approvals, rights-of-way, permits, leases, or loans for offshore \nwind projects pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices. \n \nBOEM, Postponed: Public Meetings on Draft Environmental Review of Potential Mitigation of \nFuture  Development  of  Wind  Lease  Areas  Offshore  California  (Jan.  28,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/AN9R-5FBQ. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 30 of 101\n \n \n149.  On January 30, FAST-41 dashboards that track the progress of wind projects in \ncompleting environmental review and permit processes reflected sudden permitting delays. Just \nthree days earlier, on January 27, the FAST-41 dashboard for the SouthCoast Wind Energy LLC \n(SouthCoast) project in Massachusetts indicated it had completed seven out of ten environmental \nreview and permitting processes, and review and permitting were estimated to be completed by \nMarch 27, 2025. On January 30, the dashboard indicated that the same number of environmental \nreview and permitting processes were completed, but the estimated completion date was pushed \nback  to  June  26,  2025.  Permitting  Dashboard,  SouthCoast  Wind  Energy,  LLC, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3knbk2zy.  \n150.  On February 4, BOEM announced that, due to President Trump’s Wind Directive, \nit was canceling the virtual public meetings BOEM had scheduled in February to take up its Notice \nof Intent to prepare an environmental-impact statement for a Construction and Operations Plan \nsubmitted by Vineyard Mid-Atlantic LLC. BOEM, Virtual Meetings Cancelled for Vineyard Mid-\nAtlantic Offshore Wind Project (Feb. 4, 2025), https://perma.cc/N449-GUWA.  \n151.  Soon  thereafter  BOEM  posted  the  following  notice  on  the  webpage  for  the \nVineyard Mid-Atlantic project:  \nThe Department of the Interior and BOEM are implementing President Trump’s \nmemorandum temporarily halting offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental \nShelf. The memorandum also pauses new or renewed approvals, rights of way, \npermits, leases, or loans for offshore wind projects pending a review of federal wind \nleasing and permitting practices. . . . As a result, the February virtual public \nmeetings on BOEM’s NOI to prepare an EIS for the proposed Vineyard Mid-\nAtlantic Project have been cancelled.  \n \nId. \n152.  On February 5, the Corps paused permitting for 168 renewable energy projects. The \nCorps lifted the halt a few days later—but not for wind projects. The Corps has even implemented \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 31 of 101\n \n \nthe Directive to halt Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act permitting for projects intended \nto support the wind-energy industry, such as the Arthur Kill Terminal wind component staging and \nassembly project in Staten Island, NY, as discussed below.  \n153.  On February 26, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council granted \nBOEM’s  request  to  extend  the  final  completion  date  for  a  NPDES  permit  decision  under \nSection 402 of the Clean Water Act for the SouthCoast project in Massachusetts. Permitting \nCouncil, Executive Director Determination on Request to Extend FAST-41 Final Completion Date \nby  More  Than  30  Days  (Feb.  26,  2025),  https://perma.cc/ESG5-V5Q7.  BOEM  sought  this \nextension on behalf of EPA, claiming “EPA needs additional time to evaluate the applicability of \n[the Wind Directive] to issuance of the final NPDES permit decision.” Id. The NPDES permit \ncompletion date was moved from March 27 to June 25, 2025. Id. \n154.  On  February  28,  despite  full  merits  briefing,  EPA  Region  2  filed  a  motion \nrequesting that the Environmental Appeals Board remand Atlantic Shores Offshore-Wind Project \n1’s Clean Air Act permit back to the Region for reevaluation. The motion cited the Wind Directive \nas its basis. In re Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, LLC, OCS Appeal No. 24-01 (Mar. 3, 2025). On \nMarch 14, the Environmental Appeals Board granted EPA’s request. In re Atlantic Shores Offshore \nWind, LLC, OCS Appeal No. 24-01 (Mar. 14, 2025). \n155.  On April 16, the Interior Secretary issued a memorandum instructing BOEM to \norder that the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York indefinitely “cease all construction \nactivities.” Memorandum from Doug Burgum, DOI, to Acting Dir., BOEM (Apr. 16, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/93NP-8B5Y. As explanation for its order, the memorandum stated only that, \npursuant to the review ordered in the Wind Directive, DOI had “obtained information that raises \nserious issues with respect to the project approvals.” Id. The memorandum also ordered BOEM \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 32 of 101\n \n \n“to continue [its] review of Federal wind permitting practices with respect to both existing and \npending permits.” Id.  \n156.  Within  hours,  BOEM  issued  a  stop  work  order  for  Empire  Wind,  effective \nimmediately, “to allow time for [BOEM] to address feedback it has received, including from . . . \nNOAA, about the environmental analyses for that project.” Letter from Walter Cruickshank, \nBOEM, to Empire Offshore Wind LLC (Apr. 16, 2025), https://perma.cc/EV6D-TKSK. This \nfeedback, the acting director wrote, was an “outgrowth” of the review DOI is undertaking pursuant \nto the Wind Directive. Id. The acting director’s order warned that activities related to Empire Wind \nmay not resume until “BOEM has completed its necessary review.” Id. \n157.  To  date, Agency  Defendants  have  offered  no  explanation  for  the  delays  and \ndisruptions to wind-energy permitting and development other citing the Wind Directive.  \n158.  Furthermore, at no point did any Agency Defendant provide a reasoned explanation \nfor its sharp reversal of federal policy or decisions regarding wind-energy development. \nD.  States Are Relying on Continued Wind Energy Development and Deployment to \nProvide Reliable and Affordable Energy while Promoting Economic Growth, \nReaching Their Climate Goals, and Protecting the Health and Welfare of Their \nResidents \n159.  Wind power provides over 10% of the country’s renewable energy, making it the \nlargest source of renewable energy in the United States. Its continued development is critical to \nmeet the increasing demand for reliable and affordable energy in the States’ jurisdictions while \ncreating well-paying jobs, advancing energy diversity, reaching their climate goals, and protecting \nthe health and welfare of their residents. \n160.  The United States is projected to see a 16% increase in electricity demand by 2029.  \n161.  According to the Department of Energy, “wind turbines provide one of the lowest-\npriced energy sources available today.” U.S. Dep’t of Energy, Advantages and Challenges of Wind \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 33 of 101\n \n \nEnergy, https://perma.cc/XGJ2-PFH4. Wind power will be necessary to meet the increasing \ndemand for reliable and affordable electricity. \n162.  Given  its  promise,  wind  energy  has  already  attracted  billions  of  dollars  of \ninvestment—much of which has come from the States themselves. In 2022 alone, the federal \ngovernment estimated that wind projects added $20 billion to the U.S. economy. Id. \n163.  These  investments,  among  other  things,  have  created  and  continue  to  create \nthousands of well-paying jobs in the States. The industry directly employs 131,000 Americans, \nand also supports over 300,000 jobs, such as wind turbine technicians and blade fabricators. Wind-\nturbine technicians are projected to be the fastest-growing job in the country.  \n164.  Energy produced from offshore and onshore wind energy provides a source of \nreliable electricity to our States. With developments in battery storage technology, wind energy \nhas been increasingly paired with battery storage systems that efficiently store surplus electricity \ngenerated during peak wind periods for future use.    \n165.  Wind generation not only provides reliable and affordable energy and creates \neconomic opportunity in the States, but also is critical to States’ ability to mitigate harms from \nclimate change. The States are counting on continued growth in the wind industry to decarbonize \ntheir electricity generation to meet state greenhouse-gas emission-reduction goals and mitigate the \nimpacts of climate change. \n166.  Wind energy also produces major health benefits for our residents. Specifically, \nwind power reduces the impact of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide \nassociated with fossil-fueled energy resources. These reductions in turn reduce adverse health \nimpacts, including asthma, bronchitis, lower- and upper-respiratory symptoms, and heart attacks. \nU.S.  Dep’t  of  Energy,  How  Wind  Can  Help  Us  Breathe  Easier  (Aug.  21,  2024), \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 34 of 101\n \n \nhttps://perma.cc/A9NZ-GLHW. For example, one study found that in 2014 alone, improvements \nin air quality associated with wind power resulted in $2 billion in health benefits in the United \nStates.  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  A  healthy  wind  (Dec.  2,  2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/9UKT-QUZF.  \n167.  All these benefits are at risk now because the Agency Defendants’ implementation \nof the Wind Directive is threatening the wind industry in the States. In April 2024, the Department \nof Energy warned that offshore wind was “at an inflection point”—that “[f]ailure to build projects \ntoday would risk delaying cost reductions and extending risk exposure to the longer-term project \npipeline, freezing investments, and pushing an industry with both short-term and long-term \ndecarbonization momentum into dormancy.” Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Offshore Wind, \nsupra, at 16. \n168.  In other words, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation of it \nrisk depriving States of energy reliability and affordability benefits, economic activity, health \nbenefits, and environmental protection that were to come from their substantial investments in \nwind power. The deleterious effects the Wind Directive and its implementation are having on the \nStates are detailed below.  \nNew York \n169.  New York is developing both offshore and onshore wind energy to serve its growing \nelectricity load and to reduce harmful emissions. The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ \ncategorical and indefinite halt on project approvals threaten New York’s ability to pursue those \ngoals and, more specifically, the State’s progress toward its wind-specific statutory-procurement \nand greenhouse-gas emission targets.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 35 of 101\n \n \n170.  New York’s 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate \nAct), which sets forth statutory targets for greenhouse-gas reductions on an economywide basis \nand specific capacity targets for offshore wind, is designed to work alongside other state efforts to \nreduce the financial impacts of climate change and increase the quality of life for New Yorkers.  \n171.  The Climate Act establishes greenhouse-gas emission-reduction targets of 40% by \n2030 and 85% by 2050, both from 1990 levels, with a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It also \nincludes a target that New York have a 100% emissions-free electricity sector by 2040 and be \npowered by 70% renewable energy by 2030. The Climate Act also specifically sets forth a \ndevelopment target of 9,000 megawatts of offshore-wind energy by 2035. \n172.  The Public Service Commission incorporated the Climate Act’s targets of 70% \nrenewable energy and 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind energy into New York’s Clean Energy \nStandard,  under  which  the  New  York  State  Energy  Research  and  Development Authority \n(NYSERDA) issues regular procurements to purchase renewable energy certificates from new \nclean energy generation projects. Those renewable energy certificates are sold to load-serving \nentities and offered for sale to the voluntary market, reducing costs of the program to ratepayers. \n173.  Onshore- and offshore-wind projects are expected to play increasingly significant \nroles as the State pursues a zero-emissions electricity system consistent with the Climate Act’s \nobjectives. The Climate Act Scoping Plan, which provides comprehensive recommendations for \nreducing greenhouse-gas emissions and achieving net-zero emissions, forecasts that to achieve a \nfully decarbonized grid, New York will need to deploy approximately 14,600 megawatts of \nonshore wind and 14,900 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040.  \n174.  New York has three offshore-wind projects in advanced stages, one of which has \nbeen fully constructed, and the second and third of which have been under construction.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 36 of 101\n \n \n175.  The  132-megawatt  South  Fork  Wind  project  is  New York’s  first  operational \noffshore wind farm, consisting of 12 turbines. It is located within federal waters on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, approximately 35 miles east of Montauk. The project delivered energy from its \nfirst turbine to the local Long Island electric grid beginning in December 2023 and became fully \noperational in 2024.  \n176.  Among New York’s offshore wind projects currently under construction is a 924-\nmegawatt offshore wind farm located roughly 30 miles off the coast of Montauk Point, in federal \nwaters on the Outer Continental Shelf. It is expected to power nearly 600,000 New York homes \nwith commercial operations planned to begin in 2027. Onshore construction in New York State is \nsubstantially progressed, pursuant to state and local permits and approvals, with the onshore \nconverter station nearing completion. Offshore construction is also underway, having begun in the \nfirst quarter of 2025, and will follow a carefully sequenced schedule. The project has employed \nand is currently employing thousands of people in New York and across the country, and has a \nsupply chain spanning dozens of states, including ships built in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and \nPennsylvania and major components produced in upstate New York and South Carolina.   \n177.  The other offshore wind project in advanced stages, Empire Wind, is an 80,000-\nacre wind project located in federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf, 15–30 miles southeast \nof Long Island. The project includes development of the lease area in two wind farms, known as \nEmpire Wind 1 and Empire Wind 2. The developer projects that Empire Wind 1 will produce \n816 megawatts with 60–80 turbines, enough to power 500,000 homes. The project will be the first \noffshore-wind project to deliver power directly to New York City. BOEM approved the project’s \nConstruction and Operations Plan in February 2024. Construction on Empire Wind 1 began in June \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 37 of 101\n \n \n2024. The first power is expected to be delivered in late 2026, with the project fully operational in \n2027.  \n178.  On April 16, however, as noted above, the Acting Director of BOEM, at the request \nof the Interior Secretary, issued a stop work order for Empire Wind, effective immediately. Letter \nfrom  Walter  Cruickshank,  BOEM  to  Empire  Offshore  Wind  LLC  (Apr.  16,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/EV6D-TKSK.  \n179.  In addition to the projects for which construction has been completed or has begun, \nthere are twelve offshore-wind lease areas in the region without contractual commitments to a state \nthat could provide energy to New York. Of the twelve, three have successfully secured their COP \napprovals from BOEM. \n180.  Thirty-one  land-based  wind  projects  have  been  constructed  and  are  currently \noperating  in  New  York  (totaling  over  2,800  megawatts),  and  two  are  under  construction \nrepresenting 457 megawatts of nameplate capacity.  \n181.  There are more than more than 20 land-based wind projects in development in New \nYork State in various stages of development. Many of these projects have not yet received their \nnecessary federal permits. Land-based wind projects contracted with NYSERDA are expected to \nprovide hundreds of millions of dollars in incremental economic benefits to New York State. Of \nthis, a significant amount is expected to be paid directly to local authorities (including towns, \ncounties and school districts) via Payments In Lieu Of Taxes (PILOT) and host community \nagreements. These projects would also provide financial support directly to the residents of towns \nwhere the projects are built through bill credits paid annually over the first 10 years of the projects’ \noperation.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 38 of 101\n \n \n182.  The wind-energy industry supported over 4,400 jobs in New York State as of 2023. \nAdditional wind projects are anticipated to accrue similar economic benefits, amounting to many \nbillions of dollars of in-state spending, many thousands of local jobs (in aggregate, approximately \n18,000 to 23,000 jobs are projected to be tied to offshore wind development in New York State), \nand significant attendant economic benefits throughout the state and the country. \n183.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation also threaten supply \nchain projects related to the wind industry. For example, Atlantic Offshore’s Arthur Kill Terminal, \na 32-acre state-of-the-art offshore-wind staging and assembly port facility under development in \nStaten Island, is poised to play an important role as part of the infrastructure supporting offshore \nwind energy servicing New York and the region. The Terminal is expected to bring thousands of \njobs to Staten Island and regional workers during both construction and operation of the port \nfacility, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in local spending to Staten Island and the \nsurrounding area. Construction of the project is being partially financed by a $48 million grant \nfrom the New York State Urban Development Corporation through a federal grant. See 89 Fed. \nReg. 65,483 (Aug. 9, 2024).  \n184.  After a multiyear design phase, construction of the Arthur Kill Terminal project was \nto begin this year, with operations expected to begin in 2027. That schedule has been disrupted, \nhowever, because, upon information and belief, the Corps has halted consideration of applications \nfor permits under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors \nAct, citing the Wind Directive as the basis for halting its review of those permits. That delay is not \njust holding up the project, but also jeopardizing the Terminal’s ability to use the $48 million grant \ngiven the September 30 deadline for completion of NEPA review. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 39 of 101\n \n \n185.  As another example of a supply-side business premised on continued wind-energy \ndevelopment, Equinor is also executing on a major capital investment plan to turn the South \nBrooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT), located in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, into a \nstate-of-the-art staging and assembly facility for offshore-wind components that will also serve as \na regional operations and maintenance hub for Empire Wind 1 and other offshore wind projects. \nNYSERDA has entered into a grant agreement with the Equinor subsidiary responsible for these \nimprovements to SBMT, under which NYSERDA has committed to provide $60 million upon \nsubstantial completion of the work. Construction on the project commenced in June 2024 and is \nwell underway.  \n186.  The  Wind  Directive  and Agency  Defendants’  implementing  actions  also  risk \nstranding significant investments New York has made in support of wind energy. \n187.  For  example,  the  Public  Service  Commission  has  approved  over  $8  billion \ninvestment in transmission improvement projects that support wind and other renewable resources. \nThis investment includes the approval of 62 local transmission projects to support the integration \nof clean energy sources in upstate areas, including wind generation; Con Edison’s proposal to \ndevelop the Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub to address the local reliability needs and increased \ndemand associated with the electrification of vehicles and buildings in New York City as well as \nprovide interconnection points for up to 4,500 megawatts of new energy resources, including \noffshore wind; and upgrades to enhance reliability for Long Island and New York City and allow \nmore efficient distribution of electricity generated by existing resources as well as the potential \nintegration of new electric generation resources including renewable-energy resources.  \n188.  The continued addition of wind generation in New York’s energy mix provides \ncritical resource diversity benefits to the State’s energy system. The New York Independent System \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 40 of 101\n \n \nOperator (NYISO) has found that resource diversity of all types in fuel source, mode of operation, \ngeography, and size can contribute to the resilience and reliability of the system. Wind power can \nproduce  electricity  at  times  when  solar  energy  facilities  cannot.  In  this  way,  wind  energy \ncomplements the increasing amount of solar generation being developed in New York. \n189.  NYISO modeling also shows that deployment of renewable energy resources—\nincluding land-based and offshore-wind projects—has the potential to reduce resource production \ncosts by displacing generation that would otherwise clear the market at a higher price. This effect \noccurs because these resources reduce the need for low-efficiency power plants and provide long-\nterm price stability, while also increasing energy independence by reducing the need to import \nfuels into New York from other states and countries. \n190.  Offshore wind projects such as Empire Wind 1, Sunrise Wind, and future projects \nwill interconnect to New York’s Zones J (New York City) and K (Long Island), which the NYISO \nidentifies to be constrained areas, meaning that each zone must be served primarily by local \ngenerators (such as offshore-wind projects) due to transmission limitations. \n191.  Offshore wind projects can provide critical energy diversity benefits to these \nconstrained zones. A recent analysis commissioned by the NYISO found that the availability of a \nlarge quantity of offshore-wind energy able to be injected directly into the grid serving New York \nCity and Long Island enhances grid reliability in modeled seventeen-day cold weather events as a \ncomplement to natural gas and oil-fired units by reducing dependency on oil inventories and \nhelping to preserve limited oil and natural gas supplies. \n192.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  actions  categorically  and \nindefinitely halting wind-energy approvals also undermine New York’s implementation of the \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 41 of 101\n \n \nClimate Act by increasing the need for and cost of state actions to further reduce greenhouse-gas \nemissions to achieve its statewide emission limits under the Climate Act.  \n193.  In addition, the Wind Directive and the Agency Defendants’ implementing actions \nthreaten significant adverse environmental and public health consequences to New York residents, \nincluding by delaying much needed air quality improvements by stalling the transition from fossil \nfuels to renewable energy sources, increasing reliance on aging natural gas “peaking units.” \nIncreased offshore-wind generation in the locations where these peaking facilities are most used—\nthe New York City metropolitan ozone nonattainment area—would reduce emissions and improve \nair quality for New Yorkers. \nMassachusetts \n194.  In 2022, Massachusetts enacted An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind. \nSt. 2022, c. 179. The Act aimed to move Massachusetts toward its mandate of net-zero greenhouse-\ngas emissions by 2050 through the promotion and development of offshore wind, including by \nrequiring procurement of 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by June 30, 2027. Id. § 61(b). \nMassachusetts also has an RPS, which requires that retail energy suppliers annually increase the \nshare of renewable energy generation that is supplied to electricity customers. Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 25A, § 11F. \n195.  The Act directed the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to coordinate \nand lead a wind-energy procurement process with a staggered schedule. The fourth and fifth \nprocurement processes are underway. Massachusetts thus far has three projects that are currently \nin different stages of development and permitting, which together, once constructed, would provide \n2,678 megawatts of offshore wind. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 42 of 101\n \n \n196.  Vineyard  Offshore  and  Avangrid’s  Vineyard  Wind  1,  selected  in  the \nCommonwealth’s first procurement process, will ultimately supply 800 megawatts of electricity, \nenough to power over 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind 1 received \nits  final  federal  permits  in  2021  and  started  producing  reliable  and  affordable  energy  to \nMassachusetts customers in January 2024.  \n197.  Massachusetts’s second project, Ocean Winds’s SouthCoast Wind, is expected to \nproduce 1,087 megawatts of electricity for Massachusetts and 200 megawatts for Rhode Island. \nAlthough  the  project  has  secured  most  federal  approvals—including  its  Construction  and \nOperations Plan—progress on outstanding approvals has been paused pursuant to the Wind \nDirective. Ocean Winds is negotiating power purchase agreements with Massachusetts utilities in \nthe fourth procurement, but negotiations are delayed. The uncertainty created by the Wind \nDirective creates risk for the project and its power purchase agreement negotiations.  \n198.  The third offshore-wind project in the Massachusetts pipeline is Avangrid’s New \nEngland Wind 1, a 791-megawatt project that was set to begin construction in 2025 and to start \ngenerating electricity in 2029. The project has obtained all required federal permits, and Avangrid \nis negotiating power purchase agreements with Massachusetts utilities in the fourth procurement. \nNegotiations are delayed in tandem with the Ocean Winds negotiations. \n199.  Onshore wind is also an important part of the electricity generation mix serving \nMassachusetts. Electric Distribution Companies in the Commonwealth have signed long-term \ncontracts with seven utility-scale projects, which have achieved commercial operation and are \ncurrently  generating  625  megawatts  of  renewable  energy  for  Massachusetts  residents  and \nbusinesses.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 43 of 101\n \n \n200.  Additionally, there are substantial onshore-wind resources available in northern \nNew England that have not yet been developed. Massachusetts, along with other New England \nstates, has been working with the regional grid operator ISO-New England (ISO-NE) to unlock \nthis potential, but the uncertainty created by the federal government presents new hurdles and \ndrives up costs.  \n201.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  actions  categorically  and \nindefinitely  halting  wind-energy  approvals  threaten  energy  reliability  and  affordability  to \nMassachusetts ratepayers, including the Commonwealth as a ratepayer.  \n202.  In 2024, 55% of the electricity produced by New England’s power plants was fueled \nby natural gas. ISO-NE, Resource Mix, https://perma.cc/3EA3-6T96. \n203.  Massachusetts is on its way to becoming a winter-peaking state, meaning electricity \ndemand is highest in the colder months, and Massachusetts’s natural-gas infrastructure is running \nclose to maximum capacity on the coldest days.  \n204.  When natural-gas power plants cannot secure enough supply to generate electricity, \nmore expensive and often more polluting generators are brought online to produce electricity, \nresulting in higher prices for Massachusetts electricity customers and more harmful emissions for \nMassachusetts communities. \n205.  And  Massachusetts’s  reliance  on  natural  gas  leaves  consumers  vulnerable  to \nfluctuations in natural-gas prices, and corresponding fluctuations and spikes in electricity prices.  \n206.  Offshore-wind generation is expected to reduce the instances of higher variable cost \nelectric generators being dispatched by ISO-NE. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 44 of 101\n \n \n207.  Offshore wind has its highest capacity factor during the coldest months, when the \ngenerating system for electricity production in Massachusetts is most strained. ISO-NE, Variable \nEnergy Resource Data, https://perma.cc/2ZCX-NZTC. \n208.  Wind  energy  can  lower  wholesale  energy  market  costs  in  New  England  by \ndisplacing more expensive marginal-cost generation from fossil fuels. ISO-NE recently found that \nwithout offshore wind the cost of energy to New England customers is expected to increase by \nabout 50% in 2050. Kornitsky et al., 2024 Economic Study, ISO-NE, at slide 23 (Mar. 19, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/EDS6-NJZJ. \n209.  Additionally, ISO-NE found in 2023 that New England would need to replace over \n5,000 megawatts of aging fossil fueled generation in the coming years with new sources of power \ngeneration to maintain a reliable grid. ISO-NE, Overview and Regional Update, at slide 13 \n(Jan. 19, 2023), https://perma.cc/U4BB-Y48S; ISO-NE, Operational Impact of Extreme Weather \nEvents  (2023),  https://perma.cc/9UXZ-299Q.  By  contributing  new  power  generation  and \ndiversifying the region’s electricity mix, wind and other renewable energy resources can help \naddress these reliability concerns.  \n210.  As a case in point, in 2018 ISO-NE found that 1,600 megawatts of offshore-wind \ngeneration during an extended cold weather period from December 24, 2017, to January 8, 2018, \ncould have resulted in substantial economic environmental benefits, including: (1) lowering \nregional electricity production costs by $80 million to $85 million, resulting in an $11 to $13 per \nmegawatt-hour reduction in ISO-NE day-ahead energy market prices; (2) avoiding emissions of \n219,200 short tons of CO , reducing regional CO  emissions from electricity production during \n2 2\nthe period by 11%; and (3) avoiding consumption of 5,300 short tons of coal, 1.81 billion cubic \nfeet of natural gas, and 160,200 barrels of oil. ISO-NE, High-Level Assessment of Potential \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 45 of 101\n \n \nImpacts of Offshore Wind Additions to the New England Power System During the 2017-2018 Cold \nSpell (Dec. 17, 2018), https://perma.cc/U5G7-4UV6. \n211.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  actions  categorically  and \nindefinitely  halting  wind-energy  approvals  also  risk  stranding  significant  investments  by \nMassachusetts in wind energy.  \n212.  Massachusetts, through the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC), has \ninvested more than $330,000,000 since 2011 in offshore-wind infrastructure; workforce training; \nsupply chains; and research and development. This includes: $135,000,000 via the Massachusetts \nOffshore  Wind  Ports  Investment  Challenge  program;  $149,000,000  in  funding  for  facility \nimprovements to ensure that New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, which MassCEC owns \nand  operates,  can  accommodate  future  offshore-wind  projects;  $18,000,000  to  various \norganizations as a part of the Offshore Wind Works grant program, designed to increase the \nCommonwealth’s  capacity  to  create  a  capable  offshore-wind  workforce;  and  $5,600,000  to \ndeveloping and administering a supply chain directory.  \n213.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the Agency  Defendants’  implementing  actions  also \nthreaten Massachusetts’s ability to meet its greenhouse-gas emission-reduction goals and RPS, as \nwell as its specific requirements for procuring offshore wind. \n214.  With  1,500  miles  of  coastline,  and  5.2  million  people  or  73%  of  the \nCommonwealth’s  population  residing  in  coastal  communities,  Massachusetts  is  particularly \nvulnerable to sea-level rise and increasingly frequent extreme weather events attributed to climate \nchange. Over the twenty-first century, Massachusetts is projected to experience approximately 4.0 \nto 7.6 feet of sea-level rise, and estimates of coastal property damage for the Commonwealth are \nexpected to reach over $1 billion per year by the 2070s. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 46 of 101\n \n \n215.  Without wind-energy development, Massachusetts will need to find different and \nmore expensive ways to achieve its climate goals and mitigate the risk of these impacts. Indeed, \nwithout offshore-wind energy available to bring online, the total annualized build costs to \nMassachusetts’s climate mandates would increase by $26 billion. Kornitsky et al., supra, at 21.  \nArizona \n216.  Arizona  has  more  than  1,300  megawatts  of  onshore  wind  capacity  under \ndevelopment at three sites in northern and eastern Arizona: Forged Ethic, West Camp, and Lava \nRun. Despite being sited on private and Arizona State Trust Land, all three projects are subject to \nfederal permitting review, including under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.  \n217.  In Arizona, State Trust Land is leased to private land users. State Trust Land lease \nrevenues are used to fund public education from kindergarten through college. \n218.  Forged Ethic will provide 323 megawatts of wind-generation capacity, millions of \ndollars in State Trust Land lease payments, lease payments to local, private landowners, and tens \nof millions of dollars in local tax revenues or PILOT payments to Coconino County.  \n219.  The Bureau of Reclamation will conduct a NEPA review of Forged Ethic’s request \nto interconnect to a transmission system partially owned by the Bureau. \n220.  West Camp is designed to provide up to 504 megawatts of wind generating capacity. \nWest Camp will pay millions of dollars to lease State Trust Land, as well as lease payments to \nprivate landowners, and local tax revenues or PILOT payments to Navajo County.  \n221.  Lava  Run  will  provide  500  megawatts  of  wind  generating  capacity,  while \ncontributing an estimated $75 million to lease State Trust Land and $31.5 million in property tax \nrevenues over 35 years to Apache County. Lava Run will also provide revenue to local landowners.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 47 of 101\n \n \n222.  Arizona’s three largest electric utilities plan to procure gigawatts of additional wind \ngenerating capacity over the next two decades. Utilities plan to invest in wind because, in concert \nwith solar, battery energy storage, and natural-gas-fired generation, wind energy provides the least \nexpensive and most reliable power. \nCalifornia \n223.  Wind energy provides many benefits to California, including as an important \nrenewable energy resource and in meeting California’s renewable energy and climate policies.  \n224.  In 2023, wind energy accounted for approximately 11% of California’s total energy \ngeneration and approximately 6% of total in-state energy generation.  \n225.  California has enacted several renewable energy and climate goals and policies. For \nexample, California’s 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018 (SB 100) and Clean Energy, Jobs, \nand Affordability Act (SB 1020), among other things, require that renewable-energy resources and \nzero-carbon resources supply 100% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers \nby  December  31,  2045,  and  100%  of  electricity  procured  to  serve  all  state  agencies  by \nDecember 31,  2035.  Cal.  Pub.  Util.  Code  §  454.53. Additional  interim  targets  require  that \nrenewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity \nto California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% of all retail sales of electricity to \nCalifornia end-use customers by December 31, 2040. Id. SB 100 also increased California’s \nRenewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) target to require utilities to procure 60% of retail sales from \nrenewable sources by 2030. Cal. Pub. Util. Code § 399.15. \n226.  The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (SB 32) also requires \nreducing statewide greenhouse-gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Cal. Health & \nSafety Code § 38566. The California Climate Crisis Act (AB 1279) requires California to achieve \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 48 of 101\n \n \ncarbon neutrality as soon as possible, but no later than 2045, and to reduce statewide greenhouse-\ngas emissions to at least 85% below 1990 levels by 2045. Cal. Health & Safety Code § 38562.2. \n227.   The State anticipates using wind energy to meet these climate goals and energy \npolicies. California has set goals to develop 2 to 5 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 and \n25 gigawatts by 2045 pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 25991.1. California \nhas also established a program to support, including via financial incentives, the buildout of \noffshore- wind facilities by supporting the improved capabilities of California ports, harbors, and \nother waterfront facilities. Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 25666. In September 2024, the California \nEnergy Commission released a competitive solicitation pursuant to that program to fund proposed \nprojects.  \n228.  Wind energy helps to diversify California’s portfolio of renewable electricity \nresources, reduce total resource costs, and improve the reliability and resiliency of California’s \nelectricity system. Wind energy can also complement the generation attributes of other renewable-\nenergy resources. \n229.  There are five federal wind leases off California’s coast. Two are located offshore \nin Northern California near Humboldt, California, the remaining three are located offshore in \nCentral California near Morro Bay. The leases were effective as of June 1, 2023. The leases support \nthe development of floating offshore wind in deep-water sites.  \n230.  In exchange for bidding credits, the lessees committed to providing collectively \nover $50 million to communities, Native American tribes, or interested parties that may be \nimpacted from the lease development through Community Benefit Agreements. The lessees also \ncommitted to providing workforce training and domestic supply chain development benefits.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 49 of 101\n \n \n231.  The  offshore-wind  leases  are  expected  to  provide  additional  economic  and \nworkforce benefits to California. \n232.  There  are  over  one  hundred  onshore-wind  projects  throughout  California. \nAdditional onshore-wind projects are also proposed to be built in the state.  \n233.  California is also currently processing an application for an offshore-wind project \nin state waters near Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. The developer has \nindicated that the project is likely to require federal review and approvals, which would likely be \nimpacted by the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation. This wind project is \nalso anticipated to provide economic and workforce benefits to California.  \n234.  As  discussed  above,  BOEM  has  cancelled  virtual  public  meetings  regarding \nBOEM’s programmatic NEPA review for future offshore-wind development in California, citing \nthe Wind Directive.  \n235.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  actions  categorically  and \nindefinitely halting wind-energy approvals threaten the viability of proposed and future wind-\nenergy generation projects in California. Those wind-energy projects would deliver economic \nbenefits; reduce air pollution, including in areas in nonattainment of federal and state air quality \nstandards, by stalling the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources; and improve \ngrid reliability through increased diversification of energy sources.  \nColorado \n236.  Wind energy has played a role in the evolution of Colorado’s greenhouse-gas \nemission-reduction goals. In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation setting statewide greenhouse-gas \nemission reduction targets of 26% by 2025, 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050, all compared to a \n2005 baseline. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 25-7-102(2)(g) (2019). Four years later, Colorado increased \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 50 of 101\n \n \ninterim targets to include a 65% reduction by 2035, 75% reduction by 2040, and a 90% reduction \nby 2045, and updated the 2050 target to set a 100% reduction goal in net statewide greenhouse-\ngas pollution by 2050. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 25-7-102(2)(g). To meet these goals, the statute instructs \nutilities to seek to provide their customers with energy generated from 100% clean energy \nresources by 2050. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 40-2-125.5(3)(a)(II).  \n237.  Colorado energy producers utilize wind energy to meet Colorado’s greenhouse-gas \nemission-reduction goals. In 2023, wind power accounted for 28% of the state’s total energy \ngeneration and 70% of renewable generation in Colorado. After more than quadrupling its use of \nwind energy from 2010, Colorado now ranks sixth nationwide for installed wind generating \ncapacity. Continued installation of wind energy is essential for Colorado to achieve its 100% \nreduction goal in net statewide greenhouse-gas pollution by 2050, as contained in Colo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 25-7-102. \n238.  Colorado  had  roughly  5,000  megawatts  of  wind  installed  in  2022.  In  2021, \nColorado modeled meeting state-wide energy needs through 2040. Under the least-cost scenario, \nutilities would need to deploy an additional 9,300 megawatts of wind energy to meet the state’s \n2030 goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80% from a 2005 baseline.  \n239.  Wind provides the lowest cost electricity, supplying the state with roughly 71% of \nits total electricity. Replacing wind with other resources increases costs to consumers.  \n240.  The same study also showed that utilities would have roughly 10.6 gigawatts of \nwind installed in 2040. Other scenarios range from 12 gigawatts to roughly 22 gigawatts. \nConnecticut \n241.  Connecticut  has  worked  to  shift  reliance  away  from  fossil  fuels  and  toward \nrenewable-energy sources, including wind. Connecticut has had an RPS in some form since 1998. \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 51 of 101\n \n \nThe RPS requires electric suppliers to obtain a specified percentage of the energy they sell or \ndistribute to Connecticut customers from renewable sources through the purchase of Renewable \nEnergy Certificates (RECs). The total renewable output targets have increased each year, and \nPublic  Act  18-50,  codified  at  Connecticut  General  Statutes  §  16-245a,  doubled  the  RPS \nrequirement from 20% by 2020 to 40% by 2030.  \n242.  Under  Public Act  18-82,  “An Act  Concerning  Climate  Change  Planning  and \nResiliency,” Connecticut must achieve state economy-wide greenhouse-gas emission reductions \nof at least 45% below 2001 levels by 2030, adding to the existing requirement of at least 80% \nbelow 2001 levels by 2050. Public Act 22-5, “An Act Concerning Climate Change Mitigation,” \nrequires Connecticut to achieve a 100% greenhouse-gas emissions-free electricity supply by 2040. \n243.  In addition, in passing Public Act 19-71, “An Act Concerning the Procurement of \nEnergy Derived from Offshore Wind,” the Connecticut Legislature created a process for the \nDepartment of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) to work with other state officials to \nsolicit competitive proposals for offshore-wind projects. The Act also authorizes DEEP to direct \nthe state’s electric distribution companies to enter into long-term contracts with bidders meeting \ncertain criteria, which DEEP has done. DEEP also has similar procurement authority for additional \nClass I renewable-energy resources, including both onshore and offshore wind. Conn. Gen. Stat. \n§§ 16a-3f, 16a-3g, 16a-3h, 16a-3j, and 16a-3m.  \n244.  In 2018 and 2019, using its authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 16a-3n and 16a-\n3m, DEEP selected 200 megawatts and 104 megawatts from the Revolution Wind offshore-wind \nproject  in  two  separate  competitive  solicitations. The  Public  Utilities  Regulatory Authority \n(PURA) subsequently approved contracts with Connecticut’s electric distribution companies, \nEversource and United Illuminating. The project is expected to reach commercial operation in \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 52 of 101\n \n \n2026,  at  which  point  it  will  deliver  electricity,  and  associated  renewable-energy  credits,  to \nConnecticut, as well as provide wholesale energy and capacity market and reliability benefits to \nthe broader New England grid. \n245.  Connecticut  had  previously  approved  procurements  from  two  onshore-wind \nprojects: 126 megawatts from the Cassadaga project and 5 megawatts from the Holiday Hill \nCommunity Wind project. These projects achieved commercial operation in 2021 and 2018, \nrespectively, and are providing energy and RECs to support Connecticut’s energy needs and clean \nenergy targets.  \n246.  Connecticut also has an interest in future procurements of wind energy. Public \nAct 19-71 provides DEEP with existing statutory authority to conduct competitive solicitations for \nup to 2,000 megawatts of additional offshore wind to meet Connecticut’s energy needs and clean-\nenergy targets. DEEP also has additional authority to conduct new competitive solicitations for \noffshore wind and onshore wind under Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 16a-3f, 16a-3g, 16a-3h, 16a-3j, and \n16a-3m. DEEP’s October 2021 Integrated Resources Plan found that, to achieve the state’s target \nof a 100% greenhouse-gas emissions-free electricity supply by January 1, 2040, significant \nadditions of new zero-carbon generation will be required. This need includes potentially 352–557 \nmegawatts of new onshore wind and 3,745-5,710 megawatts of new offshore wind by 2040 under \na range of assumptions and scenarios, including availability of other generating resources. \n247.   Connecticut is also working regionally with other states and ISO-NE to advance \nwind energy. On March 31, 2025, ISO-NE issued a request for proposals (RFP) from transmission \ndevelopers to upgrade the transmission grid in Maine to accommodate the interconnection of at \nleast 1,200 megawatts of onshore wind generation to the New England grid.  \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 53 of 101\n \n \n248.  This RFP is the first procurement being conducted as part of a new regional \ntransmission planning and procurement process that Connecticut worked to develop with ISO-NE \nand the other New England states, and which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \napproved last year. One piece of this approved framework was an agreement by the six New \nEngland states to allocate the costs of any selected project equitably across the states based on each \nstate’s share of regional electricity load. The New England states requested that the first RFP issued \nby ISO-NE under this new process focus on transmission upgrades in Maine to facilitate onshore-\nwind development, which will lower wholesale energy and capacity market costs and improve grid \nreliability in Connecticut and across the region. \n249.  Wind generation contributes to grid reliability by reducing Connecticut’s reliance \non fossil fuels, all of which must be imported from outside the region. New England currently \nrelies on natural gas to generate approximately half of the region’s electricity. This creates \nreliability concerns during the winter, when there is high natural gas demand for heating, or in \ncases where unanticipated disruptions to the pipeline system or unavailability of gas limit the \nability of natural gas-fired generators to run. Wind energy can help fill these gaps and reduce the \nregion’s reliance on natural gas.  \n250.  By reducing reliance on fossil fuels, Connecticut’s efforts to bring wind energy \nonline also help insulate the state’s electricity ratepayers from price spikes and volatility associated \nwith fossil fuels.  \n251.  In addition to procuring energy from wind, Connecticut has invested in facilities \nsuch  as  the  redeveloped  Connecticut  State  Pier  Terminal  in  New  London  to  support  the \ndevelopment of offshore wind and create new jobs and economic-development opportunities in \nthe State. The State has committed over $200 million to the redevelopment of the State Pier \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 54 of 101\n \n \nTerminal. The Terminal is one of only three marshaling facilities on the East Coast that are \nassembling offshore-wind turbines for deployment, and was the first one with open ocean access. \nThe Terminal is already supporting the assembly and delivery of approximately 160 turbines for \nthree offshore wind projects—South Fork Wind, Revolution Wind, and Sunrise Wind—that will \nprovide power to Connecticut, New York, and Rhode Island. Once installed, these projects will \nhave an estimated output of 1,760 megawatts, enough to power more than 1 million homes. Staging \nand assembly operations at the terminal are expected to generate more than 100 well-paying jobs. \nThe Terminal also has the potential to support further offshore wind deployments, together with \nassociated jobs in Connecticut.  \n252.  By introducing regulatory uncertainty in the development of new onshore wind and \noffshore wind, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation harm Connecticut in \nnumerous ways.  \n253.  The Wind Directive and its implementation undermine Connecticut’s ability to \nprocure additional energy from onshore- and offshore-wind generation as needed to meet the \nstate’s energy and environmental requirements, including statutory requirements to reduce in-state \ngreenhouse-gas emissions and transition the state’s electricity supply to non-greenhouse-gas-\nemitting  sources  of  power. As  a  result,  the  Wind  Directive  and  its  implementation  harm \nConnecticut’s ability to protect its residents, as part of a broader effort, from the growing impacts \nof climate change, which include increased flooding, extreme heat, wildfires, and extreme storms.  \n254.  The  Wind  Directive  and  its  implementation  also  threaten  the  reliability  of \nConnecticut’s electricity grid. Delaying or preventing development of new wind energy in the \nregion prevents Connecticut and other New England states from bringing new energy resources \nonline that ISO-NE has determined are important to ensuring a reliable grid.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 55 of 101\n \n \n255.  Furthermore, the Wind Directive and its implementation undermine Connecticut’s \nability to ensure affordable electricity and protect the state’s electricity ratepayers by developing \nwind-energy resources that will lower wholesale energy and capacity-market costs and will reduce \nthe state’s reliance on price-volatile fossil fuels.  \nDelaware \n256.  Wind energy is one of the sources of energy covered in Delaware’s Renewable \nEnergy Portfolio Standards Act. 26 Del. C. § 352. The law was based on a finding that the benefits \nof electricity from renewable energy resources accrue to the public at large, and that electric \nsuppliers and consumers share an obligation to develop a minimum level of clean energy in the \nelectricity supply portfolio of the State. These benefits include improved regional and local air \nquality, improved public health, increased electric supply diversity, increased protection against \nprice volatility and supply disruption, improved transmission and distribution performance, and \nnew economic development opportunities. 26 Del. C. § 351. The Act required that retail sales of \nelectricity include a minimum percentage of “eligible energy resources” and solar photovoltaics, \nculminating in 2035 with at least 40% of the former and at least 10% of the latter. 26 Del. C. \n§ 354(a). Wind energy qualifies as an “eligible energy resource[].” 26 Del. C. § 352(8).  \n257.  In enacting Delaware Climate Change Solutions Act of 2023, 84 Del. Laws, c. 141, \n§ 1, the Delaware’s General Assembly found that: (1) anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse \ngases are contributing to climate change; (2) climate change threatens the health and well-being of \nthe people of Delaware; (3) climate change poses risk to Delaware’s continued economic vitality; \nand (4) actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase resiliency have co-benefits \nto economic development, job opportunities, public health and air and water quality. 7 Del. C. \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 56 of 101\n \n \nc. 100. The Climate Change Solutions Act mandates a 50% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions \nbelow 2005 levels by 2030. The goal by 2050 is net zero greenhouse-gas emissions.  \n258.  Related to these goals, Delaware is the future home to infrastructure necessary to \nsupport the U.S. Wind project in Maryland, described below. U.S. Wind has purchased 140 acres \nof land surrounding the existing Indian River Power Plant in Delaware for up to three substations \nto accommodate the incoming power and connect it to the grid. The project, which is undergoing \ncounty  review,  could  generate  over  two  gigawatts  of  electricity,  suitable  to  power  over \n718,000 homes. This would save Delaware ratepayers a projected $253 million in utility bills over \nthe twenty-year lifespan of the turbines, reducing average bills by $9 a month. \nDistrict of Columbia \n259.  Under the District of Columbia’s RPS, D.C. is currently required to receive 52% of \nits energy supply from renewable energy sources located within the PJM Interconnection (PJM)’s \nfootprint. Each year, the required amount of clean energy supply increases, reaching 100% by \n2032. Further, under the Clean Energy D.C. Omnibus Amendment Act, the District must reduce \ngreenhouse-gas emissions each year with the ultimate goal of achieving a 100% reduction—or net \nzero greenhouse-gas emissions—by 2045. Currently, wind energy from projects within PJM \nsupply 4–5% of the District’s energy directly, while the balance is supplied through the purchase \nof RECs generated from clean-energy sources within PJM. Thus, the cost of energy in D.C. is \nhighly dependent on the supply of clean energy in PJM. And while the amount of energy supplied \ndirectly by wind to D.C. is small in comparison to fossil fuel sources, wind is by far the largest \nsource of clean energy within PJM—the future development of which holds the greatest potential \nof helping D.C. achieve its clean energy and climate goals at a reasonable price.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 57 of 101\n \n \n260.  Conversely, policies that hinder the development of wind energy—such as the Wind \nDirective and Agency Defendants’ implementation—will drive up the cost of energy in D.C. and \nmake it less likely that the District will meet its clean-energy and climate goals.  \nIllinois \n261.  Illinois  has  a  robust  wind  industry,  with  10,198  megawatts  of  wind  projects \noperating as of November 2024.  \n262.  Wind power constituted 12.27% of all electricity generated in Illinois in 2023, with \nover 21 million megawatt hours generated from wind projects.  \n263.  In  2021,  Illinois  enacted  the  Climate  and  Equitable  Jobs Act,  which  directs \ngreenhouse-gas emission reductions across all areas of Illinois’s economy, including electricity \ngeneration. The law commits Illinois to 100% carbon-free energy generation by 2045, with interim \ngoals of 40% by 2030 and 50% by 2040.  \n264.  Illinois also has an RPS, as memorialized through Section 1-75(c) of the Illinois \nPower Agency Act, which requires the Illinois Power Agency to attempt to procure cost-effective \nrenewable energy resources equal to 40% of each Illinois electric utility’s load by 2030, climbing \nto 50% of each utility’s load by 2040. Additionally, to comply with the Illinois RPS, the Illinois \nPower Agency “shall endeavor to procure 45% from new and repowered wind and hydropower \nprojects.” Because RPS compliance may not involve the development of new dams, hydropower \nis not expected to play a significant role in achieving the RPS. \n265.  To  meet  its  statutory  commitments,  the  Illinois  Power  Agency  periodically \nconducts procurements for new wind farms.  \n266.  One procurement yielded a successful bid for a 300 megawatt utility-scale wind \nfarm from Apex Clean Energy. This wind farm, Prosperity Wind, is currently under construction \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 58 of 101\n \n \nin Galesville, Illinois, a rural farming community. It will produce enough power for 99,000 homes \nand will consist of up to 50 turbines.  \n267.  Other recent Illinois procurements have yielded successful bids for onshore utility-\nscale wind farms that ranged in capacity from 200 megawatts to 450 megawatts.  \n268.  Meeting the Illinois RPS is important to maintain a stable, reliable, and cost-\neffective power supply for at least two reasons. First, new sources of electricity are needed to meet \nunexpected projected load growth Illinois is facing due to data centers and other large load \ncustomers, while simultaneously maintaining a cost-effective power supply for Illinois residents.  \n269.  Second, as outlined in Section 9.15 of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act \n(415 ILCS 5), Illinois law requires that all electricity generating units reduce carbon dioxide and \nco-pollutant emissions to zero by 2045 on a progressive retirement or emission-reduction schedule \nthat takes effect in 2030. Without bringing new wind projects online, Illinois is unlikely to be able \nto satisfy this obligation.  \nMaine \n270.  Wind energy likewise plays a role in Maine’s achievement of climate and clean-\nenergy goals. In 2019, Maine enacted a state law, 38 Me. Rev. Stat. § 576-A, to expand the original \ngreenhouse-gas emission-reduction goals set forth in prior 2003 legislation. The new goals include \nthe reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions to at least 45% below 1990 levels by January 1, 2030, \nand to at least 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. In 2019, Maine Governor Janet Mills signed an \nexecutive order adding the goal of achieving carbon neutrality in Maine by 2045, which was \ncodified in 38 Me. Rev. Stat. § 576-A(2-A).  \n271.  Maine also has an RPS that requires 80% of the electricity sold in Maine to be \nsupplied by renewable energy resources by 2030, and 100% by 2050.  \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 59 of 101\n \n \n272.  In addition, the Maine Wind Energy Act, 35-A Me. Rev. Stat. §§ 3402, 3404, \nincludes onshore and offshore statutory goals and requirements, recognizes that wind energy can \nachieve reliable, cost-effective, sustainable energy production, and is a valuable domestic energy \nresource that can help achieve the state’s climate and clean-energy requirements. \n273.  With respect to future energy procurements that influence Maine’s ability to meet \nits RPS, the 2021 Maine Renewable Energy Goals Market Assessment released by the Governor’s \nEnergy Office (GEO) states that “many lower-cost pathways to meet Maine’s RPS requirements \nin the next decade are achievable through the development of high-quality wind resources in \nwestern and northern Maine, which in turn require new transmission investments.” Kasina et al., \nState  of  Maine  Renewable  Energy  Goals  Market  Assessment,  State  of  Maine  GEO,  at  2 \n(Mar. 2021), https://perma.cc/S6HW-N2RH.  \n274.  Onshore-wind energy generated 27% of Maine’s renewable electricity generation \nin 2023, the 10th highest wind power share among U.S. states.  \n275.  Maine currently hosts the majority of New England’s onshore-wind resources with \nover 1000 megawatts installed. Onshore wind generally has its highest capacity at night and during \nthe winter months and therefore balances the almost 7000 megawatts of solar installed in the \nregion, providing an important energy and capacity resource precisely when it is most needed \nduring winter cold spells. Furthermore, Maine enjoys very high wind capacity potential both in \nnorthern Maine as well as along the western Maine mountains and to the east near the shore. These \ndifferent resource areas ensure that even if the wind is not blowing in one area, there can be energy \nproduced from another. Overall, the 1000+ megawatts of onshore wind are currently producing \nfossil-free low-cost energy to benefit Maine ratepayers and helping ensure winter reliability to the \nentire regional grid. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 60 of 101\n \n \n276.  In January 2024, the GEO issued the Maine Energy Plan, which outlines strategies \nto further reduce energy costs, ensure reliability and resilience, and increase the diversity of energy \nresources. State of Maine GEO, Maine Energy Plan (Jan. 2025), https://perma.cc/3DRJ-6P93. The \nPlan was informed by an 18-month stakeholder engagement process and an expert technical report. \nThe report found that 100% clean energy is achievable, beneficial, and results in lower overall \nenergy costs across the economy. Murphy et al., Maine Pathways to 2040: Analysis and Insights, \nState of Maine GEO (Jan. 2025), https://perma.cc/PJ3U-R8BU. Both onshore and offshore wind \ndevelopment will play a crucial role in achieving that goal.  \n277.   The Maine legislature has found that integrating Maine’s wind resources is in the \npublic interest and will provide a valuable local energy resource that will reduce reliance on fossil \nfuels and will benefit Maine ratepayers. 35-A 38 Me. Rev. Stat. 3402. \n278.  On April 1, 2025, the Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) released a Request \nfor Information to advance the procurement of northern Maine resources, including wind, and \nassociated transmission. Participation by interested states, such as Massachusetts, would reduce \ncosts to Maine by spreading the investment across all participating states.  \n279.  Developing renewable resources and associated transmission in northern Maine \nprovides a significant opportunity to meet Maine and the region’s energy goals and stabilize costs \nfor ratepayers. Northern Maine possesses some of the highest quality renewable energy potential \nin the region. But Maine has been unable to fully unlock that potential and the accompanying \neconomic and community benefits due to interconnection limitations and a need for additional \ntransmission capacity. Projects developed under the 2021 Northern Maine Energy Act are poised \nto address these longstanding challenges, bring jobs, tax revenue, and economic opportunities to \nnorthern Maine, and provide important improvements to system reliability and resiliency. In \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 61 of 101\n \n \naddition, these projects aim to help reduce energy costs over the long-term by placing downward \npressure on regional electricity prices while also helping confront challenges from climate change \nby reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.  \n280.  In July 2023, Governor Mills signed “An Act Regarding the Procurement of \nOffshore  Wind  Energy  Resources”  into  law,  which  requires  procurement  of  at  least \n3000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040. P.L. 2023, Ch. 481. \n281.  Maine’s Energy Plan identifies offshore wind as a key energy generation source to \nhelp meet Maine’s long-term energy and reliability needs. Maine Energy Plan, supra. Responsible \nand sustainable development of offshore wind is essential to meet Maine’s growing electricity \ndemand as well as the state’s clean energy, climate, and economic development goals. Offshore \nwind is also identified as an important sector in the State’s 10-Year Economic Strategy. Maine \nDep’t  of  Econ.  and  Cmty.  Dev.,  Maine  Economic  Development  Strategy  (Nov.  15,  2019), \nhttps://perma.cc/CF9P-67YZ.  \n282.  ISO-NE has identified offshore wind as a key element in meeting the region’s \nenergy and reliability needs for a variety of reasons, including the ability to locate generators in \nclose proximity to large population hubs, which can help reduce strain on the transmission system. \nISO-NE found that es: “[a] large share of the region’s future offshore-wind production will likely \ncome from the Gulf of Maine lease area.” ISO-NE, 2050 Transmission Study: Offshore Wind \nAnalysis, at 9 (Mar. 21, 2025), https://perma.cc/TVN7-9KLW. Delaying offshore-wind projects \nwill have significant adverse impacts to Maine ratepayers and consumers in the entire region.  \n283.  Maine is also pursuing floating offshore wind energy. In August 2024, BOEM \nannounced the execution of the nation’s first floating offshore-wind energy research lease for the \nState of Maine. The lease area covers a little less than 15,000 acres located 28 nautical miles off \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 62 of 101\n \n \nMaine on the Outer Continental Shelf and could allow for the deployment of up to 12 floating \noffshore wind turbines capable of generating up to 144 megawatts.  \n284.  Maine  is  unique  in  that  it  has  acquired  from  BOEM  its  own  offshore-wind \nleasehold, specifically, the Research Array leasehold, separate from the commercial leaseholds in \nthe Gulf of Maine. The Maine Research Array will advance the University of Maine’s patented \ntechnology; conduct important research to examine offshore wind’s effects on the Gulf of Maine \nfishing, wildlife, and ecosystem; and support economic development through the advancement of \nan offshore-wind supply chain and workforce. The Research Array project would be the first major \nfloating offshore-wind farm in the United States and would position Maine as a leader in this \nimportant technology. The GEO has been working with staff at the Maine PUC, the developer and \nthe state’s regulated utilities on a draft power purchase agreement. This effort was recently \nsuspended, however, at the request of the developer “due to recent shifts in the energy landscape \nthat have in particular caused uncertainty in the offshore-wind industry,” New England Aqua \nVentus, LLC, Procedural Order Suspending Negotiations, Me. Pub. Util. Comm’n Dkt. No. 2022-\n00100 (Mar. 28, 2025), particularly the Agency Defendants’ implementation of the Wind Directive.  \n285.  Separately, with respect to commercial offshore-wind development off the coast of \nMaine, after years of extensive stakeholder engagement and analysis, BOEM executed commercial \noffshore-wind leases in the Gulf of Maine in December 2024. In October 2024, the DOI announced \nthe results of the lease sale in the Gulf of Maine, which included two winners on four lease areas. \nInvenergy NE Offshore Wind, LLC, secured a lease that includes 97,854 developable acres and is \napproximately 46.2 nautical miles from Maine. Invenergy also won a southern lease that consists \nof 117,780 developable acres and is approximately 21.6 nautical miles from Massachusetts. \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 63 of 101\n \n \nAvangrid Renewables, LLC, won two southern leases that each sit approximately 29.5 nautical \nmiles from Massachusetts, and include 98,565 and 124,897 developable acres, respectively.  \n286.  The Wind Directive and its implementation directly impact Maine’s ability to meet \nits statutory energy and climate goals. Onshore wind is the lowest cost clean energy resource \navailable, and Maine has the best regional wind potential. For example, the Wind Directive and its \nimplementation have directly and negatively impacted the collective work of the six New England \nstates and ISO-NE on transmission solutions to the region’s growing energy needs.  \n287.  The Wind Directive and its implementation also threaten the State’s ability to \neffectively implement its statutory requirements to begin its first commercial offshore-wind \nsolicitation in 2025. Further delays could threaten the state’s ability to achieve its statutory \nrequirement of procuring 3000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040. Moreover, the Wind Directive \nand its implementation threaten the ability to deliver low-cost onshore wind resources, as required \nby statute, in northern Maine. 35-A Me. Rev. Stat. § 3210-I.  \nMaryland \n288.  Offshore wind also figures into Maryland’s strategy to address climate change. The \nClimate Solutions Now Act of 2022 requires Maryland to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Md. \nCode. Env’t. § 2-1204.2. These requirements build on over a decade of state climate action, \ninvestments, and planning, all of which have specifically relied on developing offshore-wind \nresources.  \n289.  Maryland’s Offshore Wind Energy Act of 2013 set a statewide RPS of 25% by 2020 \nand created a carveout for offshore wind not to exceed 2.5% of the state’s electricity. The Clean \nEnergy Jobs Act, passed in 2019, increased the RPS to 50% by 2050, removed the 2.5% cap on \noffshore-wind electricity, and set a new goal of procuring at least 1,200 megawatts of offshore \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 64 of 101\n \n \nwind through the issuance of offshore-wind renewable-energy credits. The Promoting Offshore \nWind Energy Resources (POWER) Act of 2023 further strengthened that goal by increasing the \nstate’s offshore-wind procurement goal to 8,500 megawatts by 2031 and also established new \nprocurement processes.  \n290.  The POWER Act of 2023 also required the state Public Service Commission to \nengage with Maryland’s regional grid manager (PJM) to study transmission models that would \nfacilitate the planned development of offshore-wind resources. That process is well underway. \n291.  There are currently three offshore-wind leaseholders in Maryland-adjacent waters. \nOne of those, the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, under development by U.S. Wind, received its \nfinal  Construction  and  Operation  Permit  in  late  2024.  U.S.  Wind’s  project  will  provide \n1,710 megawatts of clean energy from a maximum of 114 turbines sited approximately 11 to \n26 miles off the coast of Maryland. Upon information and belief, the company has spent over \n$280 million developing this project to date.  \n292.  The project is slated to create $6.2 billion in total economic benefit to the state, \nincluding over $1 billion in direct in-state expenditures. Those expenditures include significant \ninvestments in a Maryland steel fabrication plant planned for the site of the former Bethlehem \nSteel facility in Baltimore County; port improvement projects; and the construction of an in-state \ncable  facility.  The  project  is  expected  to  create  13,600  direct  and  secondary  jobs  through \ndevelopment, construction, and operation. \n293.  Maryland has provided additional support to the offshore-wind industry through its \nOffshore Wind  Supply  Chain  Investment  Program  and  the Wind Workforce  and  Education \nProgram. The Supply Chain Investment program provides grant funding for businesses entering \nthe offshore wind supply chain in Maryland. Maryland provided $2 million for this program in \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 65 of 101\n \n \nFiscal Year 2025. The Workforce and Education Program provides grant funding for workforce \ntraining centers and academic institutions to build programs that support the state’s offshore-wind \nworkforce. That program received $3 million in state funding for Fiscal Year 2025. \n294.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ actions indefinitely and categorically \nhalting wind-energy approvals threaten Maryland’s ability to achieve its statutory goals and \nexacerbate the harms Maryland is facing from climate change.  \nMichigan \n295.  Wind  energy  is  a  crucial  resource  in  Michigan’s  renewable  energy  planning. \nMichigan law, 2023 Mich. Pub. Act 235, requires that electric utilities operating in the state provide \n15% of electricity sales from renewable energy each year through 2029, increasing to 50% of \nelectricity sales for 2030, and then 60% in 2035 and thereafter. The law further requires that each \nutility supply 80% of electricity sales from 2035 through 2039, and 100% of electricity sales from \n2040 and thereafter, from renewable energy, nuclear, or natural gas with carbon capture and \nsequestration.  \n296.  Wind energy, a key wintertime resource, has a central role in meeting these \nrequirements. Wind also has the lowest cost per unit energy of any new resource type. \n297.  Michigan  currently  has  approximately  3,400  megawatts  of  land-based  wind \ngeneration, providing about 7% of Michigan’s electricity consumption. Michigan utilities plan to \ndevelop or acquire more than 6,560 megawatts of land-based wind generation by 2035, most of \nwhich is in the development process now or will be in the next three years. By 2035, wind \ngeneration will provide about 25% of Michigan’s electricity consumption. Given that wind has the \nlowest cost per unit energy among the resource types required by Mich. Pub. Act 235, additional \nwind development is expected in the period after 2035. \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 66 of 101\n \n \n298.  Based on utility filings, projected wind development in Michigan will require \ninvestment of approximately $15 billion and is projected to save Michigan utility customers \napproximately $2.5 billion net present value through 2045 compared to using natural gas plants to \nprovide comparable electricity. It is anticipated that most of the 6,560 megawatts in planned wind \nprojects to be built will be required to apply for necessary permitting following federal reviews. \nAdditionally, as wind projects will be disincentivized due to regulatory uncertainty from the Wind \nDirective,  reducing  the  development  of  this  least-cost  renewable  resource  relative  to  other \nrenewable resources will raise the cost of coming into compliance with Mich. Pub. Act 235, as \nborne by Michigan ratepayers. \nMinnesota \n299.  Abundant wind-energy resources are important to achieving Minnesota’s emission-\nreduction goals and to the state’s economy. The 2023 Minnesota State Legislature adopted laws to \nreduce emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It also adopted a \ncarbon-free standard for Minnesota utilities. Minn. Stat. 216B.1691. Electricity generated or \nprocured to serve Minnesota’s retail electricity customers must be 80% carbon free for public \nutilities and 60% carbon free for other electric utilities by 2030, 90% for all electric utilities by \n2035, and 100% for all electric utilities by 2040. Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691 (2024). \n300.  The Minnesota Climate Action Framework (Framework) aims for Minnesota to \nproduce 45% of total electricity generation from wind by 2034. The Framework also calls for \ntransitioning to an energy mix that is over 75% carbon-free by the same year. \n301.  Wind-energy generation is vital for Minnesota to meet its 2040 climate goals. Wind \nprovides the largest share of Minnesota’s electricity generation from renewable resources. In 2023, \nwind energy accounted for more than 75% of the state’s renewable generation and 25% of the \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 67 of 101\n \n \nstate’s total net generation, up from 22% in 2021. In 2023, Minnesota was among the ten states \nwith the largest share of in-state generation from wind. Minnesota ranked eighth in the nation in \nwind capacity and accounted for more than 3% of the U.S. total.  \n302.  The Framework aims for Minnesota to produce 45% of total electricity generation \nfrom wind by 2034. The Framework also calls for transitioning to an energy mix that is over 75% \ncarbon-free by the same year. \n303.  Furthermore,  wind  is  an  important  renewable-energy  resource  as  Minnesota \ntransitions away from reliance on fossil fuels. Wind energy represents a homegrown, reliable, \naffordable, and clean energy resource that is produced entirely in Minnesota. Transitioning to wind \nenergy allows Minnesota to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, thereby reducing the cost volatility \nassociated with fossil fuels.  \n304.  Minnesota’s best wind resources are in the western and southern parts of the state. \nAccordingly, Minnesota’s wind farms are located primarily in rural, agricultural counties in \nwestern and southern Minnesota.  \n305.  Wind farms supplement income to agricultural counties and communities. This is \nso for three primary reasons: first, agricultural farming and wind farms work well together because \nwind turbines have a small footprint; second, the Minnesota production tax credit provides money \nto counties and townships based on wind generation; and third, landowners work with developers \nto create wind projects and receive annual payments for hosting wind turbines. There is no eminent \ndomain involved; willing private landowners develop these resources.  \n306.  Minnesota  has  over  50  operating,  repowered  (i.e.,  retrofitted  with  new  or \nrefurbished technology), permitted, in process, or expected wind-energy facilities, most of which \nare  permitted  through  the  Minnesota  Public  Utilities  Commission  and  have  undergone  an \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 68 of 101\n \n \nenvironmental review by the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Energy Environmental Review \nand Analysis. While most Minnesota wind farms are on private land, facilities may be subject to \nfederal reviews and approvals. \n307.  Wind generation is important to Minnesota’s economy by furthering job creation, \nespecially  construction  jobs  in  rural  and  agricultural  communities.  The  Commission  and \nMinnesota Legislature have, in recent years, been supportive of the benefits of local labor for wind-\nenergy facilities, which are generally located in rural and agricultural communities. These same \ncommunities that support wind farms could lose production tax benefits and the economic \nopportunities that they create. \nNew Jersey \n308.  With its extensive coastline, which is projected to experience higher sea-level rise \nthan elsewhere, and a temperature that is rising faster than the rest of the Northeast region, New \nJersey has taken legal steps to achieve greenhouse-gas-emission reductions including by spurring \noffshore wind. For instance, it passed the Global Warming Response Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 26:2C-\n40, which requires New Jersey to achieve 80% reductions from 2006 greenhouse-gas emissions \nby 2050. As the power generation sector is the second largest greenhouse-gas emissions sector, \nreducing those emissions is key to achieving these goals. Governor Murphy therefore established \na goal of reaching 11,000 megawatts in offshore-wind generation by 2040. Exec. Order No. 307 \n(Murphy) (Sept. 21, 2022). \n309.  Three offshore wind projects have Outer Continental Shelf leases from BOEM and \nregulatory approvals from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) to sell their electricity \nto the grid. The first is Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind Project 1, LLC, a 1,509.6 megawatt project \nthat had received all federal approvals. The other two are Invenergy Wind Offshore, LLC’s 2400-\n68 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 69 of 101\n \n \nmegawatt project and Attentive Energy, LLC’s 1,342 megawatt-project, neither of which has yet \nsubmitted a COP to BOEM. \n310.  As described above, citing to the Wind Directive, EPA moved to remand Atlantic \nShores Offshore Wind Project 1, LLC’s Clean Air Act permit to the agency, citing the Wind \nDirective as the basis for the request. On March 14, the Environmental Appeals Board granted \nEPA’s request. In re Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, LLC, OCS Appeal No. 24-01 (Mar. 14, 2025). \n311.  Seven other projects have Outer Continental Shelf leases, but do not yet have the \nNJBPU approvals, and there are other Outer Continental Shelf sites off New Jersey’s coast that \nBOEM has considered for possible leasing. \n312.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on \nproject approvals threatens New Jersey’s ability to reach its statutory offshore-wind-energy-\ngeneration-procurement and greenhouse-gas emission-reduction requirements, and they put at risk \nthe resources New Jersey has invested in those goals to date.  \n313.  In  2010,  the  New  Jersey  Legislature  enacted  the  Offshore  Wind  Economic \nDevelopment Act,  which  authorized  NJBPU  to  conduct  competitive  solicitations  to  select \nproposed offshore-wind projects to receive offshore-wind renewable-energy credits in exchange \nfor providing electricity to the New Jersey electric grid. The goal of these solicitations was to \nenable a percentage of New Jersey’s electric load to be supplied by offshore-wind energy. \n314.  By  2023,  after  a  series  of  executive  orders,  statutory  enactments  and  policy \nplanning documents, Governor Murphy increased New Jersey’s offshore-wind-generation goal \nfrom 7,500 megawatts by 2035 to 11,000 megawatts by 2040, and accelerated the timeline for \nreaching New Jersey’s renewable-energy goal of 100% clean energy from 2050 to 2035. \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 70 of 101\n \n \n315.  NJBPU has approved several offshore-wind-energy-generation projects, three of \nwhich  are  currently  in  development.  NJBPU’s  approval  of  offshore-wind-energy-generation \nprojects enables the State to satisfy minimum statutory requirements related to the amount of \noffshore wind New Jersey relies upon as a source of electricity. New Jersey has also worked with \nPJM, New Jersey’s regional grid manager, and FERC to award an electricity transmission project \nand commence a solicitation for the award of a second transmission project, which are necessary \nto facilitate the introduction of electricity from offshore-wind-energy-generation projects into the \nState’s electricity grid. \n316.  Wind-energy projects are expected to bring significant economic benefits to New \nJersey. For example, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind Project 1, LLC’s project includes a guarantee \nto spend $848 million during the development and construction phases of the project, which are \nexpected to lead to a total $1.869 billion in direct, indirect, and induced economic benefits into the \nNew Jersey economy throughout the life of the project, including both construction-related and \npermanent jobs. The developer made other financial commitments, including to invest tens of \nmillions of dollars in the development of offshore-wind-related manufacturing facilities and leases \nand  in  offshore-wind-related  workforce  training  and  innovation,  business  development, \neducational and community programs. By its application and as required by NJBPU’s order \napproving  the  project,  the  company  committed  to  provide  infrastructure  investments, \ncommitments to public institutions, and commitments to community groups and other initiatives. \n317.  Similarly, Invenergy Wind Offshore, LLC’s project includes a guarantee to spend \n$1.7 billion dollars during the first ten years of operation, with an estimated total of $3.7 billion in \ndirect, indirect and induced economic benefits into the New Jersey economy throughout the life of \nthe project. Invenergy is required to pay a research and monitoring fee of $24 million to New \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 71 of 101\n \n \nJersey, which is to be dedicated to research initiatives and regional environment, wildlife, and \nfisheries monitoring initiatives for assessing the impacts of offshore-wind development on New \nJersey’s natural resources. The company made various other financial commitments, including \ncommitments to invest tens of millions of dollars in the development of offshore-wind-related \nmanufacturing facilities and leases, operations and maintenance facilities, and in offshore-wind-\nrelated workforce training and innovation, business development, and educational and community \nprograms. Invenergy’s investments in offshore-wind facilities are expected to directly create \nhundreds of permanent jobs and support 1,382 jobs during the design, permitting, and construction \nphases of the Invenergy Wind Offshore, LLC, project.  \n318.  As another example, Attentive Energy, LLC’s project includes a guarantee to spend \n$760 million during the first ten years of operation, and an estimated $3.1 billion in direct, indirect \nand induced economic benefits into the New Jersey economy throughout the life of the project. \nThe company is also required to pay New Jersey a research and monitoring fee of $15 million. \nAttentive Energy, LLC, made other financial commitments, including commitments to invest tens \nof millions of dollars in the development of offshore-wind-related manufacturing facilities and \nleases, operations and maintenance facilities, and in offshore-wind-related workforce training and \ninnovation,  business  development,  educational  and  community  programs.  The  company’s \ninvestments in offshore-wind facilities are expected to create hundreds of permanent jobs and \nsupport hundreds of jobs during design, permitting, and construction phases of the project.  \n319.  NJBPU’s offshore-wind-related activities are also critical to New Jersey’s long-\nterm strategy to meet forecasted capacity demands on New Jersey’s electric grid using clean \nenergy. By eliminating New Jersey’s ability to rely upon offshore-wind energy as part of that \nstrategy, the Wind Directive and resultant federal actions make execution of New Jersey’s current \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 72 of 101\n \n \nplan, reliant upon offshore wind, impossible. Scarcity and congestion issues on New Jersey’s \nelectrical grid will worsen without offshore-wind energy, leading to greater costs for electricity to \nboth the State and its residents. In addition, the execution of a new plan without offshore wind \ndelay New Jersey’s ability to address climate change harms.  \n320.  The need for additional supply from offshore wind is critical because PJM’s \nforward-looking  planning  studies  already  envision  a  worsening  ratio  of  supply  relative  to \ndemand—even when accounting for 11,000 megawatts of offshore wind in New Jersey beginning \nin the early 2030s. Demand for electricity is currently outpacing supply on the regional grid as \nrapidly increasing electricity consumption (known as “load growth”) outpaces the addition of new \ngeneration. New Jersey’s plan of adding 11,000 megawatts of offshore-wind-energy generation by \n2040, including the three NJBPU approved projects, and as-yet unapproved projects on existing \nBOEM leases, would ease this problem by increasing available supply. Delay or loss of that \ngeneration would exacerbate the forecasted electricity supply problem, which also does not \naccount for increasing demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. \n321.  The northeast portion of the PJM grid, in which New Jersey is located, also suffers \nfrom rising annual congestion costs. For example, from 2021 to 2022 alone, congestion costs rose \nfrom $995 million to $2.5 billion. When the transmission system is congested, the most efficient \nsource of electricity is not used, and the area with remaining electricity demand is served from \nalternative, less efficient, more expensive, sources of supply.  \n322.  New Jersey’s planned offshore-wind generation and transmission development \nwould ease congestion and reduce costs, ultimately passing savings on to ratepayers, including \nNew Jersey and its residents. New Jersey’s offshore-wind generation would complement the west-\nto-east supply of electricity, while also serving as an alternative source of electricity that would \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 73 of 101\n \n \nincrease reliability and resilience for the PJM grid. Building out transmission infrastructure that \nconnects NJBPU projects to the grid could alleviate congestion, thereby reducing the costs of \nelectricity to New Jersey and its residents, by creating an additional source of electricity supply \nclose to, and to the east of, areas with significant demand.  \nNew Mexico \n323.  Wind energy is important to New Mexico’s environmental and economic goals. \nWith the lowest water-to-land ratio of all fifty states, New Mexico is particularly susceptible to \ndrought conditions caused by climate change. Like many other states that are bearing the brunt of \nthese impacts, New Mexico committed its public utilities to zero-carbon energy production by \n2045. See N.M. Stat. Ann. § 62-16-4(A)(6); N.M. Code R. 17.9.572.10(B)(6). New Mexico is \ncurrently on track to meet these goals: in 2024’s third quarter, New Mexico’s renewable electricity \ngeneration reached 49% of total electric sales, which exceeds the statutory portfolio requirement \nthat at least 40% of public utility retail sales comprise renewable energy sources by January 1, \n2025. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 62-16-4(A)(3).  \n324.  New Mexico’s ability to harness its strong wind-power potential is vitally important \nto its zero-carbon energy-production goals and to its economy. Wind produced 38% of New \nMexico’s in-state generated power in 2023. Based on data for 2024’s first quarter, New Mexico \nranks eighth in wind capacity. In 2023, New Mexico generated a net total of 39,269,000 megawatt \nhours, of which 14,915,000 megawatt hours were produced by wind. In 2024, New Mexico \ngenerated 40,148,000 megawatt hours, of which 15,285,000 were generated by wind.  Wind power \nfar outstrips any other source of renewable energy production in New Mexico. In part because of \nits strong wind-power assets, New Mexico is a net exporter of electricity. \n \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 74 of 101\n \n \n325.  Approximately 250,000 acres of New Mexico state lands are currently leased for \nwind projects that are not yet operational. Some of these projects still need federal permits, which \nthe Wind Directive promises to delay or halt. Agency actions implementing the Wind Directive \nwill endanger these projects and likely impact state-lands leasing revenue in the future. \n326.  Several renewable energy transmission projects are currently under development in \nNew Mexico. The Wind Directive’s order to agencies to pause the issuance or renewal of federal \nrights of way poses a threat to at least one of these transmission projects. \n327.  The Wind Directive’s chilling effect will deter investment in New Mexico’s wind \npower and delay its ability to reach its capacity for wind-powered energy generation and export. \nOregon \n328.  The Wind Directive and the Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on \nproject approvals threaten Oregon’s ability to develop least-cost, large-scale electricity generating \nresources to meet rapidly increasing industrial, commercial, and residential demand for power. \nThe halt also threatens Oregon’s ability to reach its statutory clean electricity and economy-wide \nprocurement and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions-reduction requirements. \n329.  Oregon is committed to meeting its energy needs with wind energy and other \nrenewable energy sources. Oregon law requires Oregon’s investor-owned electric utilities to \nreduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 80% below baseline levels by 2030 and to zero by 2040. Or. \nRev. Stat. § 469A.410(1)(a)-(c) (2023). \n330.  Oregon’s RPS incentivizes the use of new renewable resources like wind and solar. \nAt least 27% of electricity sold by “large” investor-owned utilities (e.g., PacifiCorp and Portland \nGeneral Electric Company) to retail electricity consumers located in Oregon must come from \nqualifying renewable resources, and that requirement gradually increases to 50% by 2040. Or. Rev. \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 75 of 101\n \n \nStat. § 469A.052(1)(e)-(h) (2023). Large consumer-owned utilities (e.g., the Eugene Water & \nElectric Board) must ensure that at least 25% of the electricity they sell to retail electricity \nconsumers  located  in  Oregon  comes  from  qualifying  renewable  resources  by  2025  and  in \nsubsequent calendar years. Or. Rev. Stat. § 469A.052(d) (2023). And for “small” electric utilities, \nthey must ensure that at least five percent of the electricity they sell to retail customers comes from \nqualifying renewable resources starting in 2025 and in subsequent calendar years. Or. Rev. Stat. \n§ 469A.055(2) (2023). \n331.  As of 2022, Oregon had 50 operating wind-energy facilities in the state with a total \ncapacity of 3,981 megawatts. Wind energy produced 8.8 megawatts of total electricity in 2020 and \n8.2 megawatts in Oregon in 2022. Wind energy accounted for 12.6% of Oregon’s primary energy \nproduction and 13.3% of electricity generated in Oregon in 2022. \n332.  Oregon continues to develop and site new wind-energy facilities, including hybrid \nenergy facilities that include a wind-energy component. In 2023, for example, the Oregon Energy \nFacility Siting Council (EFSC) approved the Nolin Hills Wind Power Project, a wind and solar \nenergy generation facility with a nominal generating capacity of approximately 600 megawatts \n(340 megawatts from wind and 260 megawatts from solar).  \n333.  Offshore wind is another major potential source of energy in Oregon. The National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory estimates that Oregon has the technical potential for 62 gigawatts \nof offshore-wind electricity generation capacity. The Oregon Department of Land Conservation \nhas initiated a multiyear Offshore Wind Energy Roadmap process to define the standards to be \nconsidered for offshore-wind energy development and approval, including supporting effective \nstakeholder engagement; consideration of input of coastal communities; support of sustainable \nlocal  and  regional  economic  opportunities  and  workforce;  protection  of  tribal  cultural  and \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 76 of 101\n \n \narchaeological resources; protection of culturally significant viewsheds and other interests of \nNative American tribes; protection of the environment and marine species; and achievement of \nstate energy and climate policy objectives, including energy resource diversity, reliability and \nresilience of state and regional energy systems. 2024 Or. Laws Ch. 31 § 3. \n334.  The wind-energy power generation sector provided 1,633 jobs in Oregon in 2022, \nan increase of 149 jobs from 2020.  \nRhode Island \n335.  Rhode Island has a long history of supporting development of wind power. The \nstate successfully developed and permitted the 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm in state and \nfederal waters in the 2010s. The Block Island Wind Farm became operational in the fall of 2016, \nmaking it the nation’s first commercial offshore wind farm. \n336.   As of 2024, Rhode Island’s clean-energy portfolio included 148 megawatts of \nonshore wind and 430 megawatts of offshore wind from projects that are operational or awarded \ncontracts and working toward operation. \n337.  Rhode Island is set to receive 400 megawatts of energy from Revolution Wind. As \noutlined above, that project will also provide power for Connecticut and is expected to be \ncompleted and generate electricity in 2026. \n338.  As also noted above, Rhode Island is also expected to receive 200 megawatts of \noffshore wind from Ocean Winds’s SouthCoast Wind project, which will also provide power for \nMassachusetts. \n339.  Rhode Island is committed to combatting climate change and its harmful impacts. \nTo that end, the 2021 Act on Climate sets aggressive decarbonization requirements for the \nState. See R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 42-6.2-1, et seq. This includes mandates that statewide greenhouse-\n76 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 77 of 101\n \n \ngas emissions reach 45% below 1990 levels by 2030; 80% below 1990 levels by 2040, and net-\nzero emissions by 2050. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-9 (2021).  \n340.  Additionally, Rhode Island’s Renewable Energy Standard (RI RES) requires retail \nelectricity sales in the state to include increasing renewable energy each year, ultimately reaching \n100% renewable energy by 2033. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-26-4 (2022).  \n341.  In passing the RI RES, Rhode Island’s legislature found, inter alia, that “[i]t is in \nthe interest of the people, in order to protect public health and the environment and to promote the \ngeneral welfare, to establish a renewable energy standard program to increase levels of electrical \nenergy supplied in the state from renewable resources [including wind].” R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-26-\n1(5) (2024).  \n342.  The express purpose of the RI RES is to “to facilitate the development of new \nrenewable energy resources to supply electricity to customers in Rhode Island with goals of \nstabilizing long-term energy prices, enhancing environmental quality, and creating jobs in Rhode \nIsland in the renewable energy sector.” R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-26-3 (2024).  \n343.  Per  its Affordable  Clean  Energy  Security Act  (RI ACES),  “Rhode  Island  is \ncommitted to the increased use of no- and low-carbon energy resources that diversify our energy \nsupply portfolio, provide affordable energy to consumers, and strengthen our shared quality of life \nand environment, and new energy infrastructure investments may help facilitate the development \nand interconnection of these resources[.]” R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-31-1 (2014). \n344.  In June 2022, the state amended RI ACES to support procurement of between 600 \nto 1,000 megawatts of offshore-wind capacity for Rhode Island. R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-31-10 (2022). \n345.  By introducing regulatory uncertainty in the development of new onshore wind and \noffshore wind, the Wind Directive harms Rhode Island in numerous ways.  \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 78 of 101\n \n \n346.  The Wind Directive and its implementation undermine Rhode Island’s ability to \nprocure additional energy from onshore and offshore-wind generation to meet the state’s energy \nand environmental requirements, including statutory requirements to reduce statewide greenhouse-\ngas emissions and reach net-zero by 2050, and to attain 100% renewable energy by 2033. As a \nresult, the Wind Directive also harms Rhode Island’s ability to protect its residents, as part of a \nbroader effort, from the growing impacts of climate change.  \n347.  As outlined above, delaying or preventing development of new wind energy in the \nregion prevents New England states, including Rhode Island, from bringing new energy resources \nonline that are important to ensure a reliable grid and cleaner renewable energy, and to combat the \nprice volatility related to continued reliance on fossil fuels in the region.  \nWashington \n348.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  indefinite  halt  on  project \napprovals could threaten Washington’s ability to meet its greenhouse-gas emissions requirements \nand renewable energy goals. It also threatens the existence of the wind industry, which is an \nincreasingly important part of Washington’s economy. \n349.  In 2019, Washington enacted the Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA). CETA \ncommits Washington to an electricity supply free of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2045. Wash. \nRev. Code § 19.405.010 (2019). \n350.  In 2021, Washington enacted the Climate Commitment Act (CCA). In combination \nwith a market-based cap-and-invest program and other policies, the CCA sets Washington on the \npath to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions 95% by 2050. Wash. Rev. Code § 70A.45.020 (2021). \n351.  Wind power has been and will continue to be a vital tool for Washington to meet its \nclimate and renewable-energy goals. Washington is third in the nation in utility-scale renewable-\n78 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 79 of 101\n \n \nenergy  generation  from  all  sources,  and  wind  power  is  the  second  largest  contributor  to \nWashington’s  renewable-energy  generation  after  hydroelectric  power.  In  2024,  Washington \ngenerated 8,421 megawatt-hours from wind power alone.  \n352.  Washington has recently authorized the construction of the 1,150-megawatt Horse \nHeaven Wind Farm Project through its Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, which will further \nenhance Washington’s wind power energy portfolio when construction is finished.  \n353.  Wind  power  is  one  of  the  most  promising  sources  of  renewable  energy  for \nWashington. It is an abundant and sustainable energy source that does not produce any greenhouse-\ngas emissions. In contrast to fossil fuels, which are often subject to volatile market conditions, \nwind power enhances Washington’s energy security and economic stability.  \n354.  Wind  power  helps  boost  the  Washington  economy  by  creating  jobs  in \nmanufacturing, installation, and maintenance. Developers in Washington are exploring innovative \ndual use approaches to minimize any disruption to agricultural productivity and traditional land \nuses while providing new economic opportunities for Washingtonians. \n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act - 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n(Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n(Against Agency Defendants) \n355.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs. \n356.  Agency  Defendants  are  “agenc[ies]”  under  the Administrative  Procedure Act \n(APA). 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1). \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 80 of 101\n \n \n357.  Agency  Defendants  have  adopted  and  implemented  the  Wind  Directive’s \ncategorical and indefinite halt on approvals through numerous actions beginning on January 20, \n2025, and continuing to the present. See supra ¶¶ 142–58.  \n358.  Each Agency Defendant’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive \nconstitutes final agency action. See 5 U.S.C. § 704. Specifically, the adoption and implementation \nof the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects \n“mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and is an action “from which \nlegal consequences will flow.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78 (internal quotations omitted).  \n359.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found \nto be . . . arbitrary [or] capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n360.  An  agency  action  is  arbitrary  or  capricious  where  it  is  not  “reasonable  and \nreasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). An agency \nmust provide “a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a rational connection between the \nfacts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).  \n361.  Additionally, agencies must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, \nreasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019). Agencies may not rely on explanations that are “contrived” or \n“incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking \nprocess.” Id.  \n362.  Further, when an agency changes its existing policy, it must “display awareness that \nit is changing position” and “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.” FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (emphasis in original). An agency must provide \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 81 of 101\n \n \n“a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate” \nwhen “its new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior \npolicy.”  Id.  An  “unexplained  inconsistency  in  agency  policy  is  a  reason  for  holding  an \ninterpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.” Encino Motorcars, \nLLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 222 (2016) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \n363.  Agencies also must provide a more detailed justification “when [their] prior policy \nhas engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” Fox, 556 U.S. at 515. \n364.  Here,  Agency  Defendants  provided  no  reasoned  basis  for  adopting  and \nimplementing the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals. Nor did they \nprovide any justification acknowledging or reconciling their stark departure from past agency \npolicy  on  wind  energy  development,  prior  findings  regarding  impacts  of  wind  energy,  the \nsignificant reliance interests that have developed based on that prior policy, or the inconsistencies \nwith contemporaneous Executive actions emphasizing the need for and promoting domestic energy \ndevelopment while curtailing review for non-wind domestic energy sources.  \n365.  First, the only explanation provided by Agency Defendants for indefinitely and \ncategorically halting wind approvals—that they are implementing the Wind Directive—does not \nconstitute a reasoned explanation because the Wind Directive itself lacks reasoned explanation.  \n366.  Specifically, the Wind Directive cites “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the \nFederal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects” and alleged \n“potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363. Neither the Wind \nDirective nor Agency Defendants have pointed to any alleged legal deficiencies or inadequacies \nthat could justify the categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects. Nor \ncould they, as prior to the issuance of the Wind Directive, Agency Defendants followed the \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 82 of 101\n \n \nnumerous  statutory  authorities  governing  wind-energy-project  reviews  and  approvals  and \nsuccessfully defended such reviews and approvals in courts.  \n367.  Similarly, although the Wind Directive alleges that wind-energy development risks \n“negative  impacts  on  navigational  safety  interests,  transportation  interests,  national  security \ninterests, commercial interests, and marine mammals,” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363, it fails to cite any \nspecific risk or factual basis that could warrant the categorical and indefinite halt—nor could it, \ngiven Agency Defendants’ comprehensive reviews and findings regarding such risks and available \nmitigation. Tellingly, even the vaguely described scope of the “assessment” ordered in the Wind \nDirective does not include all of these purported “negative impacts” from wind projects. \n368.  Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on project approvals marks a \nstark departure from the federal government’s longstanding, bipartisan policy of encouraging \nwind-energy development and fails to provide any factual findings or explanation regarding its \ndeparture from the findings that underlay its prior policy, much less provide “a more detailed \njustification” to explain any such conflicting findings.  \n369.  Indeed,  past  Presidential  administrations  have  repeatedly  supported  the \ndevelopment of offshore- and onshore-wind energy.  \n370.  Agency Defendants have repeatedly assessed wind-energy development and found \nno impacts warranting denial of approvals under relevant authorities.  \n371.  By  way  of  example,  the  Wind  Directive’s  purported  need  to  consider  the \nenvironmental impact of wind projects on marine mammals ignores prior agency studies and \nfindings that have examined marine-mammal impacts generally, as well as individual permits that \nhave included mitigation measures to alleviate impacts on marine mammals.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 83 of 101\n \n \n372.  As  another  example,  the  Wind  Directive’s  claim  of  threats  to  “commercial \ninterests” ignores the fact that the economic impacts of wind energy have been extensively studied, \nboth generally and with regard to specific projects.  \n373.  Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on project approvals also fails \nto account for the significant reliance interests that the States and other stakeholders have formed \nbased on Agency Defendants’ policies and decisions supporting and approving wind-energy \ndevelopment.  \n374.  For example, States have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to create state-\nof-the-art facilities capable of accommodating wind turbine construction; relied on predictable \npermitting processes to bring online wind resources that will boost reliability and affordability to \nalleviate  burdens  associated  with  increasing  energy  demand;  invested  in  supply  chains  and \nworkforce training programs with the expectation that jobs and economic stimulus will accompany \nwind industry development; and relied on wind energy to alleviate the negative impacts of climate \nchange and public health harms associated with fossil-fueled energy generation. \n375.  Agency Defendants’ halt on approvals of wind-energy projects altogether failed to \naccount for the States’ reliance interests.   \n376.  Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy \nprojects  is  also  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  it  reflects  significant  “unexplained \ninconsistenc[ies]” with the federal government’s current policy toward the development of energy \nresources in the United States. Encino Motorcars, 579 U.S. at 222. \n377.  In adopting and implementing the Wind Directive, Agency Defendants have failed \nto explain the inconsistencies between the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on \nfederal approvals of wind-energy projects until completion of an extra-statutory assessment and \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 84 of 101\n \n \nnumerous other Executive Orders issued on the same day and since, as well as agency actions \nimplementing  those  Executive  Orders,  that  emphasize  a  need  for  and  direct  the  expedited \ndevelopment or continued operation of domestic energy resources, including (i) the Energy \nEmergency Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433, (ii) the Unleashing Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, and (iii) the \nGrid Reliability Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,521.  \n378.  Nor have Agency Defendants explained the inconsistencies between the Wind \nDirective’s categorical and indefinite halt on federal approvals of wind-energy projects until \ncompletion of an extra-statutory assessment and multiple contemporaneously or subsequently \nissued Executive Orders that direct the expedited review of or relaxed standards for other domestic \nenergy resources, including (i) the Energy Emergency Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (and Agency \nDefendants’ expedition of permits in reliance on it); (ii) the Reinvigorating Coal Order, 90 Fed. \nReg. 15,517; (iii) the Zero-Based Budgeting Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,643, (iv) Exec. Order 14153, \nUnleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential, 90 Fed.

Finally, Agency Defendants have failed to explain their implementation of the \nEnergy Emergency Order’s edict to use “all lawful emergency or other authorities available” to \nexpedite  non-wind-energy  development  in  the  Northeastern  and  West  Coast  States  while \nimplementing  the  Wind  Directive  by  categorically  and  indefinitely  halting  wind-energy \ndevelopment in those very same states. \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 85 of 101\n \n \n380.  Because  Agency  Defendants  failed  to  explain  these  inconsistencies,  their \nimplementation of the Wind Directive is arbitrary and capricious. \n381.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a \ndeclaration that the Agency Defendants’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive to \ncategorically and indefinitely halt approvals of wind-energy projects violates the APA because it \nis arbitrary and capricious. \n382.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706, the States are entitled to vacatur of Agency Defendants’ \nadoption and implementation of the Wind Directive to categorically and indefinitely halt approvals \nof wind-energy projects, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing Agency \nDefendants from implementing the Wind Directive, including taking any action(s) to impede wind-\nenergy development in reliance, in whole or in part, on the Wind Directive. \nCOUNT II \nAdministrative Procedure Act - 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \n(Agency Action Contrary to Law and In Excess of Authority) \n(Against Agency Defendants) \n \n383.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs. \n384.  Under the APA, a reviewing court must set aside a challenged agency action that is \nfound to be, inter alia, “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” id. § 706(2)(C). \n385.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might \notherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 391 (2024) (quoting United States v. Morton Salt, \n338 U.S. 632, 644 (1950)).  \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 86 of 101\n \n \n386.  An agency thus may not take any action that exceeds the scope of its statutory \nauthority.  \n387.  Each Agency Defendant’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive to \ncategorically and indefinitely halt approvals of wind-energy projects is final agency action as it \nmarks the consummation of the agency’s decision-making process and is an action from which \nlegal consequences flow. See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78. \n388.  Because Agency Defendants have disregarded the specific requirements of laws \nand regulations governing federal permitting and approvals of wind energy by categorically and \nindefinitely halting approvals of wind-energy projects, and because they have done so pending an \nextra-statutory review grounded in no statute, Agency Defendants have acted contrary to law and \nin excess of their authority. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), 706(2)(C).  \n389.  Specifically, none of the statutory authorities governing federal approvals of wind-\nenergy development—including, but not limited to, OCSLA, the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and \nHarbors Act, the Clean Air Act, NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle \nProtection Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, FLPMA, and the Fixing America’s \nSurface Transportation Act—authorizes the Wind Memo’s categorical and indefinite halt on wind-\nenergy-project approvals implemented by Agency Defendants. To the contrary, each such authority \nand its implementing regulations contemplates comprehensive, but prompt, review and decision \npursuant to specific approval procedures and standards.  \n390.  For  example,  DOI  and  BOEM’s  adoption  and  implementation  of  the  Wind \nDirective for offshore-wind-energy projects are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority \nunder OCSLA. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1331 et seq. OCSLA does not grant agency officials authority to \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 87 of 101\n \n \nindefinitely cease permitting for particular types of projects, such as wind energy. Id. Instead, \nBOEM’s regulations under OCSLA make clear that it must process permit applications and issue \ndecisions by either approving, disapproving, or requesting revisions of permit applications. See \n30 C.F.R. §§ 585.613, 585.628, 585.648.  \n391.  By  categorically  and  indefinitely  halting  permitting  for  wind-energy  projects \npending a new, extra-statutory review, DOI and BOEM also have acted in excess of statutory \nauthority  under  and  contrary  to  OCSLA,  which  provides  for  the  “expeditious  and  orderly \ndevelopment” of Outer Continental Shelf resources. 43 U.S.C. § 1332.  \n392.  The Corps’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive likewise are \ncontrary to and in excess of statutory authority under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 33 U.S.C. \n§ 1344. Section 404 does not grant the Corps authority to cease permitting and authorizations for \nparticular types of projects, such as wind energy. Id. To the contrary, Section 404 mandates that \nthe Corps minimize permitting delays, requiring decisions on a dredge-and-fill permit application \n“to the maximum extent practicable . . . not later than the ninetieth day after the date the notice for \nsuch application is published.” Id. § 1344(q). Moreover, the Corps’s regulations classify wind and \nother energy related projects as “major national objectives” and direct that “[d]istrict engineers \nwill give high priority to the processing of permit actions involving energy projects” and to \npromptly process permit applications and issue permit decisions. 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(n).   \n393.  By indefinitely and categorically halting permitting for wind-energy projects, the \nCorps has abdicated its clear mandate to administer the Clean Water Act Section 404 permitting \nprogram. \n394.  EPA’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive are also contrary to and \nin excess of statutory authority under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. 33 U.S.C. § 1342.  Under \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 88 of 101\n \n \nSection 402, EPA or a state agency with delegated NPDES permitting authority must determine \nwithin 30 days whether the application is complete and thereafter prepare a draft permit and solicit \npublic comment before issuing a final permit. 40 C.F.R. §§ 124.3(c); 124.10(a); 124.11–124.12. \n395.  By indefinitely and categorically halting permitting for wind-energy projects, the \nCorps has abdicated its clear mandate to administer the Clean Water Act NPDES permitting \nprogram. \n396.  The Corps’s actions also are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority under \nthe Rivers and Harbors Act. 33 U.S.C. §§ 403, 408. Sections 10 and 14 of the Act do not grant the \nCorps authority to cease processing or issuing permit decisions for particular types of projects, \nsuch as wind energy. Id. For individual Section 10 permits, the Corps must, among other things, \nnotify applicants of incomplete applications within 15 calendar days; issue public notice within \n15 days of receipt of a complete application; and decide applications within 60 days, unless \nadditional information is needed. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2. Moreover, the Corps’s regulations require the \nCorps to timely process permit applications and issue permits. 33 C.F.R. §§ 320.4(n), 325.2.  \n397.  By categorically and indefinitely halting permitting for wind-energy projects, the \nCorps has abdicated its clear mandate to administer the River and Harbors Act permitting program. \n398.  EPA’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive are also contrary to and \nin excess of statutory authority under the Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C. § 7627. The Act does not grant \nEPA officials authority to cease permitting for particular types of projects, such as wind energy. Id. \nThe Clean Air Act requires permitting authorities to issue permit decisions within one year of \nreceiving an application for a Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit and within 18 months \nof receiving an application for a Nonattainment New Source Review permit. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7475(c), \n7661b(c). EPA’s regulations set additional timelines. 40 C.F.R. § 71.5(a)(2).  \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 89 of 101\n \n \n399.  By categorically and indefinitely halting permitting for wind-energy projects, EPA \nhas abdicated its clear mandate to administer the Clean Air Act permitting program.  \n400.  Agency Defendants’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive are also \ncontrary to and in excess of statutory authority under NEPA. 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. Under \nNEPA, as amended by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, lead agencies “shall complete” the required \nenvironmental assessments not later than one year after certain conditions are met, and “shall \ncomplete” required environmental impact statements not later than two years after those conditions \nare met. 42 U.S.C. § 4336a(g). \n401.  By categorically and indefinitely halting NEPA reviews for wind-energy projects, \nAgency Defendants have abdicated their clear mandates to administer NEPA.  \n402.  The Services’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive are contrary to \nand in excess of statutory authority under the Endangered Species Act. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531 et seq. \nThe Act does not authorize USFWS or NMFS to stop engaging in or foreclose completion of \nconsultation for particular types of projects, such as wind energy. Furthermore, USFWS and NMFS \nregulations  require  those  agencies  to  engage  in  and  timely  complete  consultation. \n50 C.F.R. Part 13; id. Part 17; id. Part 222; id. § 402.14(e). Indeed, the NMFS is directed to process \npermit applications “in the shortest possible time.” Id. § 222.302(b), 222.303(e). \n403.  By categorically and indefinitely halting permitting for wind-energy projects, the \nServices have abdicated their clear mandates to administer the Endangered Species Act. \n404.  USFWS’s actions also are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority under the \nBald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. 16 U.S.C. § 668. The Act does not authorize USFWS to \nstop issuing incidental-take authorizations for particular types of projects, such as wind energy. Id. \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 90 of 101\n \n \nThe Act and USFWS’s regulations instead direct the USFWS to process “all applications as \nquickly as possible.” 50 C.F.R. § 13.11. \n405.  By adopting and implementing the Wind Directive, USFWS has abdicated its clear \nmandate to administer the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. \n406.  The Services’ actions also are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority under \nthe Marine Mammal Protection Act. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1371 et seq. The Act as well as USFWS and \nNMFS regulations direct the Services to process permit applications “as quickly as possible.” \n50 C.F.R. § 13.11.  \n407.  By adopting and implementing the Wind Directive, the Services have abdicated \ntheir clear mandates to administer the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  \n408.  DOI and BLM’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive for onshore-\nwind-energy projects are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority under FLPMA. 43 U.S.C. \n§§ 1701 et seq. FLPMA does not grant agency officials authority to altogether cease issuing right-\nof-way decisions for particular types of projects, such as wind energy, and instead enumerates \nspecific bases that allow BLM to deny a right-of-way application request. 43 C.F.R. § 2804.26. \nMoreover, BLM’s regulations have specific provisions that authorize “the prioritization [of] solar \nand wind development rights-of-way,” indicating an intention that BLM should promptly process \nrights-of-way. 43 C.F.R. § 2804.35. Finally, BLM’s regulations provide that one of the core \nobjectives of the right-of-way program is to “[p]romote[] the use of rights-of-way in common \nwherever practical, considering engineering and technological compatibility, national security, and \nland use plans[.]” 43 C.F.R. § 2801.2. \n409.  By indefinitely and categorically halting permitting for wind-energy projects, BLM \nhas abdicated its clear mandate to administer the FLPMA right-of-way program. \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 91 of 101\n \n \n410.  The adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite \nhalt on approvals of wind-energy projects by each of these Agency Defendants thus are “not in \naccordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right,” id. § 706(2)(C), and accordingly violate the APA as well as \nthe statutory and regulatory provisions cited above. \n411.  Furthermore, adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive’s categorical and \nindefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects by each of these Agency Defendants is \ncontrary to APA Section 558, which requires approval applications to be processed within a \n“reasonable time,” 5 U.S.C. § 558(c); cf. id. § 554(b), and for that reason, as well, is “not in \naccordance with law,” id. § 706(2)(A). \n412.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a \ndeclaration that adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite \nhalt on approvals of wind-energy projects by each of the Agency Defendants violates APA \nSections 706(2)(A) and (C). \n413.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706, the States are entitled to vacatur of the Agency \nDefendants’ adoption of the Wind Directive to categorically and indefinitely halt approvals of \nwind-energy projects, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing Agency \nDefendants from implementing the Wind Directive, including taking any action(s) to impede wind-\nenergy development in reliance, in whole or in part, on the Wind Directive. \nCOUNT III \nEquitable Claim for Violations of Federal Law by Federal Officials  \n(Against Agency Defendants) \n \n414.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs.  \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 92 of 101\n \n \n415.  Federal courts also possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n575 U.S. 320, 326–27 (2015).  \n416.  As set out above, supra ¶¶ 389-411, Agency Defendants have violated the statutes \ngoverning permits and approvals for wind-energy development by adopting and implementing the \nWind Directive to categorically and indefinitely halt approvals of wind-energy projects. \n417.  These statutes include, but are not limited to, OCSLA, the Clean Water Act, the \nRivers and Harbors Act, the Clean Air Act, NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, the Bald and \nGolden Eagle Protection Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, FLPMA, and the \nFixing America’s Surface Transportation Act. \n418.  By adopting and implementing the Wind Directive to indefinitely and categorically \nhalt permits and approvals for wind-energy projects, Agency Defendants have violated these \nstatutes, which, along with their regulations, require comprehensive, but prompt, review and \ndecision pursuant to specific approval procedures, supra ¶¶ 389–411. \n419.  Because the Agency Defendants are violating the statutes governing wind-energy \npermitting and approvals, the States are entitled to equitable relief in the form of a preliminary and \npermanent injunction preventing Agency Defendants from implementing the Wind Directive, \nincluding taking any action(s) to impede wind-energy development in reliance, in whole or in part, \non the Wind Directive.  \nCOUNT IV \nCommon Law Ultra Vires – Conduct Outside the Scope of \nStatutory Authority Conferred on the Executive \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n420.  The Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind projects, \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 93 of 101\n \n \nand Agency Defendants’ adoption and implementation of it, are ultra vires because no act of \nCongress authorizes the President to order that federal agencies “not issue new or renewed \napprovals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore-wind projects” pending \ncompletion, at an unspecified time, of another assessment of alleged impacts of the industry. \n421.  Specifically, none of the statutory authorities governing federal approvals of wind-\nenergy development—including, but not limited to, OCSLA, the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and \nHarbors Act, the Clean Air Act, NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle \nProtection Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, FLPMA, and the Fixing America’s \nSurface Transportation Act—authorizes the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ categorical \nand indefinite halt on wind-energy-project approvals pending a redundant extra-statutory review \nin consultation with six agencies. To the contrary, these statutes require the Executive to promptly \nprocess distinct federal approvals for such development, according to specific procedures and \nstandards. \n422.  For example, under OCSLA, in contrast to its express authorization of lease \nwithdrawals, OCSLA does not provide the President or BOEM with authority to categorically and \nindefinitely halt all approvals of wind projects on the Outer Continental Shelf.  \n423.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt of \napprovals is incompatible with OCSLA’s directive for the “expeditious and orderly development” \nof the Outer Continental Shelf resources.  \n424.  In addition, by indefinitely preventing lessees from obtaining approvals and permits \nnecessary for wind projects, the Wind Directive and BOEM’s implementation of it effectively \nremove leased areas in the Outer Continental Shelf from use. While OCSLA allows the President \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 94 of 101\n \n \nto withdraw unleased areas from use, it does not grant the President or BOEM authority to \nindefinitely withdraw leased areas from use. 43 U.S.C. § 1341(a). \n425.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are therefore entitled to a declaration that \nthe Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind projects, and Agency \nDefendants’ implementation of it, are ultra vires.  \n426.  Because the Agency Defendants’ implementation of the Wind Directive is ultra \nvires, the States are entitled to equitable relief in the form of a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction preventing Agency Defendants from implementing the Wind Directive, including taking \nany action(s) to impede wind-energy development in reliance, in whole or in part, on the Wind \nDirective.  \nCOUNT V \nOCSLA Citizen Suit – 43 U.S.C. § 1349 \n(Against Defendants United States, DOI, Burgum, BOEM, and Cruickshank) \n \n427.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs. \n428.  OCSLA provides that “any person having a valid legal interest which is or may be \nadversely affected may commence a civil action on his own behalf to compel compliance with this \nsubchapter  against  any  person,  including  the  United  States,  and  any  other  government \ninstrumentality or agency (to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the Constitution) \nfor any alleged violation of any provision of this subchapter or any regulation promulgated under \nthis subchapter, or of the terms of any permit or lease issued by the Secretary under this \nsubchapter.” 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a)(1). \n429.  “The term ‘person’ includes, in addition to a natural person, an association, a State, \na political subdivision of a State, or a private, public, or municipal corporation.” 43 U.S.C. \n94 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 95 of 101\n \n \n§ 1331(d). \n430.  An OCSLA citizen suit may be brought “immediately after notification of the \nalleged violation in any case in which the alleged violation constitutes an imminent threat to the \npublic health or safety or would immediately affect a legal interest of the plaintiff.” 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1349(a)(3). \n431.  Pursuant to 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a)(3), on May 5, 2025, the States provided notice of \nviolations of OCSLA by Defendants the United States, DOI, Burgum, BOEM, and Cruickshank. \n432.  The Wind Directive and Defendants DOI, Burgum, BOEM, and Cruickshank’s (the \nDOI Defendants) adoption of its categorical and indefinite halt on permitting of wind-energy \nprojects is immediately adversely affecting the States’ legal interest in the “expeditious and orderly \ndevelopment,” 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3), of wind energy on the Outer Continental Shelf. \n433.  The  States  have  invested  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  wind-energy \ndevelopment and even more in transmission upgrades needed to bring wind-energy resources onto \nthe electricity grid. This investment has spurred the wind-energy industry to spend billions on \ninfrastructure, jobs training programs, and supply-chain development.  \n434.  The States have relied on wind energy as a reliable, affordable source of electricity \nthat helps meet rising demand. \n435.  The States also rely on wind energy to help meet their goals, often required by state \nlaw,  to  decarbonize  their  electricity  grids  and  mitigate  greenhouse-gas  emissions.  These \ndecarbonization efforts are designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, which are harming \nand will continue to harm the wellbeing and stability of the States’ communities and economies. \n436.  The Wind Directive and the DOI Defendants’ adoption and implementation of its \ncategorical, indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects violate OCSLA and its regulations \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 96 of 101\n \n \nby  ignoring  the  statute’s  clear  mandate  that  the  DOI  Defendants’  follow  its  procedures  to \nadminister the Outer Continental Shelf permitting and leasing program, as described supra ¶¶ 390–\n91, 422–24. \n437.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a declaration that the Wind \nDirective and the DOI Defendants’ adoption and implementation to categorically and indefinitely \nhalt permitting of wind-energy projects violate OCSLA as inconsistent with the statute and its \nimplementing regulations. \n438.  The States are further entitled to a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \nthe DOI Defendants from implementing the Wind Directive, including taking any action(s) to \nimpede wind-energy development in reliance, in whole or in part, on the Wind Directive. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the States respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  Declare that each Agency Defendant’s adoption and implementation of the Wind \nDirective’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects are arbitrary and \ncapricious in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \n2.  Declare that each Agency Defendant’s adoption and implementation of the Wind \nDirective’s  categorical  and  indefinite  halt  on  approvals  of  wind-energy  projects  are  not  in \naccordance with law or are in excess of statutory right in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C), and OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a); \n3.  Declare that the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on wind-energy \napprovals, and Agency Defendants’ adoption and implementation thereof, are ultra vires; \n4.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) and 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a), order vacatur of the Agency \nDefendants’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive;  \n96 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 97 of 101\n \n \n5.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin, without bond, the Agency Defendants from \nimplementing or otherwise giving effect to any action that halts or otherwise impedes wind-energy \ndevelopment based in whole or in part on the Wind Directive; and \n6.  Grant all other relief as the Court may deem just and proper, including, but not \nlimited to, attorney’s fees and costs. \n \nRespectfully submitted,            May 5, 2025 \n \nLETITIA JAMES    ANDREA JOY CAMPBELL \nAttorney General of New York  Attorney General of Massachusetts \n    \nBy: /s/ Michael J.

July 3, 2025 \n \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \n \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nNew York, Massachusetts, Arizona, California, Colorado, \nConnecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New  \nJersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and the \nDistrict of Columbia (collectively, the “Plaintiff States”), \ntogether with Intervenor Plaintiff Alliance for Clean Energy New \nYork (“ACE NY”) sue President Donald J. Trump, the United States \nof America, the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”) and its \nSecretary Douglas Burgum, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management \n(“BOEM”) and its Acting Director Walter Cruickshank, the Bureau \nof Land Management and its State Director Jonathan Raby, the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its Regional Director Paul \nSouza, and several other departments and agencies and their \nrespective heads (collectively, the “Public Officials”), based \non the Public Officials’ allegedly unlawful pause of all federal \nagency approvals needed for offshore and onshore wind energy \nprojects nationwide.  \nThe Plaintiff States and ACE NY allege that the Public \nOfficials implemented this pause in response to what the \nPlaintiff States call the “Wind Directive” and ACE NY calls the \n“Wind Ban,” Section 2(a) of a Presidential Memorandum issued by \n[3] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 4 of 49\nPresident Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, which purported \nto withdraw the Outer Continental Shelf from leasing for \noffshore wind energy projects and to pause leasing and licensing \nfor both offshore and onshore wind energy projects pending \ncompletion of a comprehensive inter-agency review process, \nciting several general grounds for concern, and that this \nwithdrawal and pause were unlawful for several reasons.   \n \nA. Procedural History \nThe Plaintiff States filed suit against the Public \nOfficials on May 5, 2025.  See Compl., ECF No. 1.  The Alliance \nfor Clean Energy New York (“ACE NY”) moved to intervene on May \n7, 2025.  ACE NY’s Mot. Intervene, ECF No. 23.  This Court \nallowed ACE NY’s motion to intervene on May 15, 2025.  Elec. \nOrder, ECF No. 78.  ACE NY filed its Intervenor Complaint on May \n21, 2025.  Compl. Intervention, ECF No. 114.  The Plaintiff \nStates subsequently filed an amended complaint on June 10, 2025.  \nFirst Am. Compl. (“FAC”), ECF No. 141. \nThe Plaintiff States bring five counts, all against the \nagency defendants except where specified: (I) a violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), for \narbitrary and capricious action in adopting and implementing a \ncategorical and indefinite halt on wind-related approvals \nwithout reasoned basis, justification for departure from past \nagency policy, or analysis of reliance interests based on past \n[4] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 5 of 49\npolicy or inconsistencies with other executive actions promoting \nenergy development, FAC ¶¶ 358-85; (2) a violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C) for \naction contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority in \ndisregarding the requirements of laws and regulations governing \nfederal permitting and approvals of wind energy, pending \ncompletion of an extra-statutory review process, id. ¶¶ 386-417; \n(3) an equitable claim for violation of federal law for the same \nstatutory violations, id. ¶¶ 418-23; (4) a common law ultra \nvires claim (against all defendants) for the President’s acting \nwithout congressional authorization in the same way, id. ¶¶ 424-\n30; (5) a citizen suit under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \nAct (“OCSLA”) (against defendants the United States, DOI, \nSecretary Burgum, BOEM, and Acting Director Cruickshank) for an \nOCSLA violation in failing to follow OCSLA’s mandate that the \nDOI must follow its procedures in administering the Outer \nContinental Shelf, id. ¶¶ 431-42. \nACE NY brings similar claims, but also alleges, in its \nCounts II and IV, that the same challenged pause (6) is a \nsubstantive rule that failed to undergo public notice and \ncomment rulemaking in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(D)(2), Compl. \nIntervention, ¶¶ 183-88; and (7) violates the United States \nConstitution, Article I, Sec. 8, Cl. 3, and Article IV, Sec. 3, \nCl. 2, and the Fifth Amendment, because through it the President \n[5] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 6 of 49\nhas usurped the lawmaking and commerce powers of Congress and \nits power to regulate United States territory and property, and \ndeprived affected owners or lessees of their property interests \nwithout due process of law, id. ¶¶ 202-210. \nThe Plaintiff States and ACE NY moved for a preliminary \ninjunction on May 12, 2025, seeking to enjoin the Public \nOfficials from implementing, relying on, or otherwise giving \neffect to Section 2(a) of the challenged Presidential \nMemorandum.  Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 53; [Proposed] \nPl.-Intervenor ACE NY’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 55.  At a \nhearing held on June 5, 2025, according to its usual practice, \nthis Court collapsed these motions with trial on the merits \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2), and, with \nthe parties’ consent, construed the Public Officials’ opposition \nto these motions, Defs.’ Consol.

Clerk’s Notes, ECF No. 157. \nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction over these \nclaims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \nB.  Facts Alleged1 \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a Presidential \nMemorandum titled “Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the \nOuter Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of \nthe Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for \nWind Projects,” which directed agencies categorically and \nindefinitely to halt all federal approvals necessary for the \ndevelopment of wind energy, pending a multi-agency review \nprocess.  90 Fed. Reg. 8363 (Jan. 29, 2025); FAC ¶ 2.  The \nPlaintiff States and ACE NY specifically challenge the agencies’ \nimplementation of Section 2(a) of the Presidential Memorandum \n \n1 These facts are drawn primarily from the Plaintiff States’ \ncomplaint.  Issues unique to ACE NY’s Intervenor Complaint are \nraised as they arise. \n[7] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 8 of 49\n(the “Wind Directive”), which states that, “[i]n light of \nvarious alleged legal deficiencies underlying the Federal \nGovernment’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind \nprojects, the consequences of which may lead to grave harm – \nincluding negative impacts on navigational safety interests, \ntransportation interests, national security interests, \ncommercial interests, and marine mammals – and in light to \npotential inadequacies in various environmental reviews required \nby the National Environmental Policy Act to lease or permit wind \nprojects,” the heads of “all . . . relevant agencies, shall not \nissue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, \nor loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the \ncompletion of a comprehensive assessment and review of Federal \nwind leasing and permitting practices,” which assessment is to \nbe led by the Secretary of the Interior, and will “consider the \nenvironmental impact of onshore and offshore wind projects upon \nwildlife, including, but not limited to, birds and marine \nmammals,” and “the economic costs associated with the \nintermittent generation of electricity and the effect of \nsubsidies on the viability of the wind industry.”  90 Fed. Reg. \nat 8363-64; FAC ¶ 3; Intervenor Compl. ¶ 3.  \nThe Plaintiff States allege that the Wind Directive has \n“stopped most wind-energy development in its tracks.”  FAC ¶ 4.  \nThey draw attention to the facial conflict between the Wind \n[8] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 9 of 49\nDirective, which pauses development of a significant source of \nthe United States’ current energy output, and the President’s \ndeclaring a “National Energy Emergency” brought on by \ninsufficient energy production, and calling for a “reliable, \ndiversified, and affordable supply of energy” via an Executive \nOrder issued the same day as the Wind Directive -- which \nExecutive Order, in addition to other executive actions, has \nencouraged domestic energy development and recommended \nregulatory shortcuts for it, with the notable exception of wind \nenergy.  Exec. Order 14156, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (Jan. 29, 2025); \nFAC ¶ 5.  They further allege that the Wind Directive has led to \nthe agency defendants’ ceasing all wind energy-related \npermitting and approvals and issuing a stop-work order to halt \nconstruction of a previously permitted offshore wind project, \nand that these actions pose an existential threat to the wind \nenergy industry, thereby harming the Plaintiff States’ ability \nto secure reliable, diversified, and affordable sources of \nenergy, in addition to harming their billions of dollars of \ninvestments in related supply chains, jobs, and infrastructure, \nand their statutory- and policy-based efforts to protect the \npublic health and welfare from pollution and greenhouse-gas \nemissions.  FAC ¶¶ 6-8.   \nACE NY, which is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization \nthat promotes the use of clean energy technology and energy \n[9] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 10 of 49\nefficiency in New York, and whose members include companies \nengaged in the development and operation of land-based wind and \nsolar power in New York and nationwide and companies developing \noffshore wind power facilities, including some “in the process \nof developing wind facilities on lands that entail federal \nactions” and some involved in manufacturing and supply chain \noperations that rely on wind energy development, Intervenor \nCompl. ¶ 12, makes similar allegations regarding the Wind \nDirective’s sweeping impact, id. ¶¶ 3, 8-10, and alleges direct \nharm to its members in the form of financial losses, impaired \ncontractual obligations and supply chains, and the potential \nclosure of some businesses, id. ¶ 76.  \n1. Factual Backdrop: Reliance History \nAs background to the challenged actions, the Plaintiff \nStates and ACE NY complain that they have relied on a long \nhistory of the federal government’s encouraging and thoroughly \nevaluating wind energy, and thus, as is relevant to their APA \nclaims, that the Wind Directive and its implementation represent \na dramatic course reversal without explanation or analysis of \ntheir vital reliance interests.  See id. ¶¶ 113-33, 376-78; \nIntervenor Compl. ¶ 10.  The Plaintiff States outline this \nreliance history beginning with the celebration of wind energy’s \ngrowth during President George W. Bush’s administration, \ncontinuing through President Trump’s actions promoting wind \n[10] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 11 of 49\nenergy in his first term, and culminating in President Biden’s \nproviding clean-energy tax credits and pledging the United \nStates to deploy thirty gigawatts of offshore wind energy by \n2030, which attracted increased investment to the sector.  FAC \n¶¶ 113-17.  They also point to various agency studies of the \nimpact of wind-energy projects on potentially affected wildlife, \nthe fishing industry, and local and state economies, to court \ndecisions finding that agencies have fulfilled their statutory \nobligations and conducted adequate environmental reviews with \nrespect to wind projects, and to comprehensive agency reviews of \nonshore wind energy projects and their environmental impacts, \npainting a picture of a long, consistent history of governmental \nawareness and evaluation of the risks and benefits posed by wind \nenergy.  Id. ¶¶ 118-26; see also Intervenor Compl. ¶¶ 38-48.  \nThe Plaintiff States further outline wind power’s role as \nthe largest source of renewable energy in the United States and \nits unique provision of low-cost energy, which has attracted \nbillions of dollars in investments, hundreds of thousands of \njobs, and further reliance interests in the form of the states’ \nefforts to meet their own greenhouse gas emission reduction, \nenvironmental protection, and population health goals.  FAC ¶¶ \n159-68. \nACE NY additionally emphasizes the states’, local \ngovernments’, and Native American tribes’ unique roles, tied to \n[11] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 12 of 49\ntheir sovereign interests and historic police powers over land \nuse decisions and economic development, in developing land-based \nwind projects, the vast majority of which are sited on \nnonfederal lands, which roles it alleges the Wind Directive has \narbitrarily usurped, in addition to harming the investment-\nbacked interests of private parties in their own property.  \nIntervenor Compl. ¶¶ 49-57, 179. \n2. The Directive and Its Adoption \nPresident Trump issued the Presidential Memorandum that \nincludes the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on \nwind-energy approvals on January 20, 2025.  FAC ¶ 127; 90 Fed. \nReg. 8363.   Section 1 of this Presidential Memorandum states \nthat it does not affect “rights under existing leases.”  FAC ¶ \n129; 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363.  Section 2(a), that is, the Wind \nDirective, prohibits agency heads from issuing “new or renewed \napprovals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore \nor offshore wind projects,” pending the completion of a \ncomprehensive review of these practices.  FAC ¶ 130; 90 Fed. \nReg. at 8364.  This comprehensive review, which is premised on \npurported legal deficiencies and negative safety, \ntransportation, national security, commercial, and marine mammal \nwildlife impacts from wind energy projects, is to consider the \nenvironmental impact upon wildlife, the economic costs of \nintermittent electricity generation, and the effect of subsidies \n[12] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 13 of 49\non the wind industry’s viability.

In addition, Section 2(c) of the \nPresidential Memorandum requires the Secretary of the Interior \nto report to the President on the environmental impact and cost \nto surrounding communities of defunct windmills.  Id. ¶ 135; 90 \nFed. Reg. at 8364.2   \nThe agency defendants have allegedly adopted and \nimplemented the Wind Directive by ceasing all pending approvals \nneeded for wind-energy projects, which the Plaintiff States \nillustrate with examples of agency actors and websites citing \nthe Presidential Memorandum when describing a pause on \npermitting, with reference to data allegedly showing a lag in \nagency permitting and environmental reviews, and with a \ndescription of the impact on specific delayed projects in \nMassachusetts and New York.  FAC ¶¶ 142-156.   \n \n2 In addition to drawing this Court’s attention to the \nfacial conflict between the Wind Directive and other Executive \nOrders calling for vigorous promotion of energy production and \ncurtailed environmental review processes for other forms of \nenergy in the face of a purported national energy crisis, \ndescribed in more detail above, the Plaintiff States point out \nthat one of the relevant Executive Orders singles out \nNortheastern and West Coast states for their role in the alleged \nenergy emergency.

Id. ¶¶ 169-357.   \nAlong similar lines, ACE NY alleges that its members are \nexperiencing severe and ongoing harms from costs to projects in \ndevelopment that cannot proceed without federal permits, lost \nincome from projects delayed or canceled, and related harms \naffecting contractual obligations, financing, and supply chain \nissues.  Intervenor Compl. ¶ 76.   \n3. Statutory Schemes \nThe Plaintiff States allege that “[n]umerous statutes and \ntheir implementing regulations require Agency Defendants to \nconsider and issue decisions on applications for wind-energy \nproject approvals,” such that these agency defendants must \n“comprehensively, but promptly, review, approve, deny, or \notherwise act on applications to construct and operate wind-\nenergy facilities, following specific procedures and standards.”  \nCompl. ¶¶ 56, 58.  \n  The statutory and regulatory violations that the Plaintiff \nStates allege most specifically are violations of OCSLA and its \nrelated regulations, because, implementing OCSLA’s general \nstatutory mandate of “expeditious and orderly development” of \nOuter Continental Shelf resources, 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3), \nPlaintiff States argue, “BOEM’s regulations under OCSLA make \n[14] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 15 of 49\nclear that it must promptly process applications and issue \npermit decisions by either approving, disapproving, or \nrequesting revisions [of permit applications],” which the Wind \nDirective precludes, such that “by indefinitely preventing all \nlessees from obtaining approvals and permits necessary for \noffshore-wind projects, the DOI Defendants have effectively -- \nalready leased\nand unlawfully, under OCSLA -- removed   areas in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf from use,” States’ Mem. 31-32; FAC \n¶¶ 59-62; 30 C.F.R. § 585.613(e)(providing that, “[u]pon \ncompletion of our technical and environmental reviews and other \nreviews required by Federal laws . . . BOEM will approve, \ndisapprove, or approve with conditions [Site Assessment Plans]” \n(emphasis added)); 43 U.S.C. § 1341(a) (providing that the \nPresident may “from time to time, withdraw from disposition any \nof the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf” (emphasis \nadded)); see also ACE NY’s Mem. 25-26; States’ Suppl. Br. 8-9; \nACE NY’s Suppl. Br. 14-15.   \nThe Plaintiff States and ACE NY also point to permitting \nprocedure regulations such as those implementing the Clean Water \nAct, which, pursuant to the statutory command that “to the \nmaximum extent practicable” the relevant permitting decisions \nshould be made “not later than the ninetieth day after the date \nthe notice for such application is published,” 33 U.S.C. § \n1344(q), provide for timely adjudication of permit applications \n[15] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 16 of 49\nwithin sixty days (albeit with exceptions), 33 C.F.R. § \n325.2(d), the timelines of which regulations are now allegedly \nnot being followed.

Pleading Standard \nPursuant to Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, a complaint “that states a claim for relief must \ncontain . . .  a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.”  To test the \nsufficiency of the pleading, a defendant can file a motion to \ndismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  “When faced with \nmotions to dismiss under both 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), a district \ncourt, absent good reason to do otherwise, should ordinarily \ndecide the 12(b)(1) motion first.”  Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 806 \nF. Supp. 2d 452, 456 (D. Mass. 2011) (Stearns, J.), aff’d, 672 \nF.3d 64 (1st Cir. 2012).  Whether a motion is brought under Rule \n12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), “the reviewing court must take all of \nplaintiff's allegations as true and must view them, along with \nall reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable \n[16] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 17 of 49\nto plaintiff.”  Verlus v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., No. 23-CV-\n11426-DJC, 2025 WL 836588, at *1 (D. Mass. Mar. 17, 2025) \n(Casper, J.).  To survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint \nmust include sufficient factual allegations that, accepted as \ntrue, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  Courts \n“draw every reasonable inference” in favor of the plaintiff, \nBerezin v. Regency Sav. Bank, 234 F.3d 68, 70 (1st Cir. 2000), \nbut they disregard statements that “merely offer legal \nconclusions couched as fact or threadbare recitals of the \nelements of a cause of action,” Ocasio-Hernández v. Fortuño-\nBurset, 640 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2011) (cleaned up). \n \nB. Article III Standing \nThe Public Officials argue that the Plaintiff States and \nACE NY are not “directly affected by the agencies’ temporary \nother parties’\nhold on making final decisions on   permit \napplications.”  Defs.’ Opp’n 12.  They point out that plaintiffs \nmust allege facts showing injury in fact, traceability, and \nredressability, and that “when the plaintiff is not himself the \nobject of the government action or inaction he challenges, \nstanding is not precluded, but is ordinarily ‘substantially more \ndifficult’ to establish.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 562 (1992) (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 758 \n(1984)); Defs.’ Opp’n 12.  This is because “causation and \n[17] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 18 of 49\nredressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated \n(or regulable) third party to the government action or inaction \n– and perhaps the response of others as well,” so the plaintiff \nin this scenario has the burden “to adduce facts showing that \nthose choices have been or will be made in such manner as to \nproduce causation and permit redressability.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 562.   \nThis argument somewhat mischaracterizes the complaints.  As \nto ACE NY, which relies on an associational standing theory \nbased on direct harm to its members, ACE NY has alleged that its \nmembers are experiencing delays in permitting decisions leading \nto costs and other harms, Intervenor Compl. ¶ 76, and has \nsupported these allegations with declarations pointing to \nspecific projects, see, e.g., Decl. Marguerite Wells, Executive \nDirector of ACE NY Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Wells Decl.”) ¶¶ \n21-49, ECF No. 63 (detailing harms to member leaseholders and \nmanufacturers allegedly attributable to Wind Directive).  Thus, \nthe argument that the harms at issue are too indirect does not \ndefeat ACE NY’s standing. \nThe Plaintiff States are more properly the target of the \nPublic Officials’ third-party-standing argument, but this \nargument fails as to them as well.  As another district court \nhas observed in the context of a challenge brought by states to \nan extended pause on oil and gas leasing offshore and on public \n[18] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 19 of 49\nlands, the Plaintiff States “have alleged . . . as a result of \nthe [Wind Directive] . . . [imminent] loss of jobs and economic \ndamage,” in addition to lost “income” from pledged investments.  \nLouisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d 267, 285 (W.D. La. 2022).  \nThis is harm to them allegedly caused by the Wind Directive \nitself, not harm based on the decisions of some party not before \nthe Court.  In addition, “Plaintiff States have special \nsolicitude because they assert a congressionally bestowed \nprocedural right (the APA), and the government action at issue \naffects the Plaintiff States’ quasi-sovereign interests (damage \nto economics, loss of jobs, . . . funding for state and local \ngovernments).”  Louisiana, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 286.   \nGiven the reasoning on which Lujan’s caution against third-\nparty standing claims was based -- that is, on the concern that \nsuch claims ask courts to speculate on actions of parties not \nbefore the court or actions which it cannot compel by a \nfavorable ruling, 504 U.S. at 562 -- the Public Officials’ \ngeneral argument against standing cannot be dealt with fully \nwithout addressing the heart of the Public Officials’ standing \narguments, which is, in essence, that the plaintiffs here may \nnot get what they want no matter what this Court rules, because \ntoo many intermediate decisionmakers are involved in the permit-\nissuing and other processes on which the threatened wind \nprojects depend, and so which amounts to a kind of \n[19] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 20 of 49\nredressability argument.  Defs.’ Opp’n 13-18; Defs.’ Suppl. \nReply 5. \nThis argument rests on a fundamental misconstrual of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, which gives courts the relatively \nmodest task of correcting deviations in agency procedure -- and \nnot, of course, of second-guessing reasonably made decisions of \nthe Executive Branch, or peering behind the curtain to guess at \nwhat an agency may do next.  See Federal Commc’ns Comm’n v. \nPrometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021) (explaining \nthat APA arbitrary-or-capricious review requires only “that \nagency action be reasonable and reasonably explained,” and that \n“a court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of \nan agency”).  As the Supreme Court has observed, even where \n“[a]gencies . . . have discretion about whether or not to take a \nparticular action,” “those adversely affected by a discretionary \nagency decision generally have standing to complain that the \nagency based its decision upon an improper legal ground.”  \nFederal Election Comm’n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 25 (1998).  \nInjuries may therefore be both traceable and redressable “even \nthough the [agency] might reach the same result exercising its \ndiscretionary powers lawfully.”  Id.  “We rarely know when we \nultimate\nentertain a case . . . whether the agency’s   action will \nbe favorable to the [plaintiff].  Our job is limited to \ncorrecting a legal error –- if error is committed –- in the \n[20] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 21 of 49\nagency decision.”  Akins v. Federal Election Comm’n, 101 F.3d \n731, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citations omitted), vacated on other \ngrounds, 524 U.S.  At the same time, if legal error has been \nalways\ncommitted, “it has   been an acceptable feature of judicial \nreview of agency action that a petitioner’s ‘injury’ is \nredressed by the reviewing court notwithstanding that the agency \nmight well subsequently legitimately decide to reach the same \nresult through different reasoning.”  Id.  As the Supreme Court \nhas summarized, “[w]hen a litigant is vested with a procedural \nright [such as those conferred by the APA], that litigant has \nstanding if there is some possibility that the requested relief \nwill prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision \nthat allegedly harmed the litigant.”  Massachusetts v. E.P.A., \n549 U.S. 497, 518 (2007) (emphasis added).  It is a feature, not \na bug, of this review process that, when the smoke settles, the \nparties may find themselves in roughly the same place they \nbegan. \nAlthough this analysis covers the core of the Public \nOfficials’ arguments on standing, this Court addresses their \nspecific arguments below, while noting where this general \nanalysis governs. \n \nC. State Plaintiffs’ Standing \nThe Public Officials argue that the State Plaintiffs fail \nto satisfy the concrete injury requirement because, when alleged \n[21] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 22 of 49\ninjuries are forward-looking, plaintiffs must show an imminent, \nsubstantial risk of future harm, but the State Plaintiffs have \nalleged only possible future injury.  Defs.’ Opp’n 12-13.  They \nargue that the alleged energy reliability and affordability, \neconomic, health, and environmental benefits which the State \nPlaintiffs claim they will be deprived of if the Wind Directive \ncontinues to be implemented are “extremely broad and \nunspecific,” and therefore not actual or imminent in the \nrequired sense.  Id. at 13.  More specifically, the Public \nOfficials contend that the states do not “demonstrate that any \nparticular wind project would be authorized and completed but \nfor the Wind Memo,” pointing out that only a few states mention \nspecific wind projects, and some of those states that do mention \nspecific projects do not specifically allege that these projects \nhave pending applications that are currently being unlawfully \ndelayed.  Id.   \nSimilarly, but as to traceability, the Public Officials \nargue that the Plaintiff States’ general allegations about \nenergy and economic impacts and the like are too attenuated to \nsatisfy this requirement, because the causal connection between \na temporary cessation on wind project approvals and future \nenergy crises depends on weak inferences, beginning with the \nassumption that the Wind Directive will cause agencies not to \napprove projects and continuing through the assumption that \n[22] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 23 of 49\nother power generators will fail to provide the required power.  \nId. at 16-17.  As to redressability, the Public Officials argue \nthat the Plaintiff States cannot show that but for the Wind \nDirective federal approvals would be forthcoming and would bring \nthe wide-ranging benefits the Plaintiff States allege they would \nreceive, particularly given the myriad factors that go into \nmaking wind energy projects successful.  Id. at 17-18.  \nThese arguments are dealt with in large part by the \nobservations supra, Section II.B: because they invoke a \nprocedural right under the APA, the plaintiffs need plausibly \nallege only “some possibility that the requested relief will \nprompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that \nallegedly harmed the litigant.”  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 518.  \nThe Public Officials acknowledge that at least some of the \nstates allege harms related to specific projects in the course \nof the permitting process, Defs.’ Suppl. Reply 3-12, which the \nplaintiffs allege has been indefinitely halted, and which halt \nhas allegedly harmed them significantly, both with respect to \nthese specific projects and otherwise, FAC ¶¶ 201-12, 318-25; \nStates’ Suppl. Br. 2-3, 6 (describing Massachusetts’ and New \nJersey’s imminent harms in terms of unrealized energy and \neconomic benefits, including lost jobs, frustrated state \ninvestments, and millions of dollars committed by specific wind \nenergy projects to state projects); Decl.

July 1, 2024) (finding standing for plaintiff states \nbased on “lost or delayed revenues tied to . . . natural gas \nproduction” and “here and now injury by . . . delayed \ninvestments” reducing future revenues). \nAs to the Public Officials’ argument that the Plaintiff \nStates’ alleged harms are overly speculative and thus \ninsufficiently imminent, unlike the lost proceeds from the one \nalready-scheduled lease sale that was canceled by the pause in \nLouisiana, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 279-80, this is a distinction \nwithout a difference: the district court in Louisiana considered \nthe state plaintiffs’ allegations of imminent job loss and other \nfinancial and economic harms alongside the allegations of \nalready-lost potential proceeds, id. at 285, and here the \nPlaintiff States allege additional harms not present in \nLouisiana, such as energy reliability and affordability problems \ndue to reliance on the regulatory regimes the Wind Directive has \ninterrupted, and difficulty meeting state statutory emission-\nreduction goals meant to benefit the states’ residents, FAC ¶¶ \n159-68.  The First Circuit has observed that a state may show a \n[24] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 25 of 49\nsufficiently imminent “substantial risk of fiscal injury to \nitself” based on “rational economic assumptions” and “concrete \nevidence.”  Massachusetts v. United States Dep’t of Health & \nHum. Servs., 923 F.3d 209, 223 (1st Cir. 2019) (first quoting \nAdams v. Watson, 10 F.3d 915, 923 (1st Cir. 1993); and then \nquoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 409, 420 (2013)).  \nThe Plaintiff States’ mundane assumption that a total, \nindefinite pause on wind energy development will cause them \nfinancial and other economic harms, when, for instance, \nMassachusetts alleges that it has invested hundreds of millions \nof dollars in offshore-wind infrastructure since 2011, and is to \nreceive tens of millions in in-state investment in relation to \none stalled project, which project is anticipated to generate \nmore than 10,000 jobs, is eminently rational, FAC ¶¶ 211-12, and \nis backed up by concrete evidence in the form of declarations, \nsee, e.g., Decl. Bruce K. Carlisle ¶¶ 22, 25-27, 38, ECF No. 71-\n5.  The Plaintiff States’ specific allegations regarding \nalready-canceled or delayed supply chain contracts, power \npurchase agreements and agreement negotiations, and construction \nprojects, moreover, FAC ¶¶ 198, 315-18, bring the facts of this \ncase in line with those confronted by the district court in the \nliquefied natural gas export pause case Louisiana v. Biden, \nwhere the court found imminent harm to state plaintiffs based on \nprojected loss of tax revenues, decreased investments in natural \n[25] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 26 of 49\ngas development and infrastructure, and already-delayed \ncontracts, investments, and construction, 2024 WL 3253103, at \n*10. \nTo the extent that the Public Officials invite this Court \nto engage in hair-splitting analysis of each state’s alleged \nharm, this Court declines to do so at this stage.  “So long as \none plaintiff has standing to seek a particular form of global \nrelief, the court need not address the standing of other \nplaintiffs seeking the same relief.”  Comfort v. Lynn Sch. \nComm., 418 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).  “[T]he \npresence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy \nArticle III’s case-or-controversy requirement.”  Rumsfeld v. \nForum for Acad. and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 \nn.2 (2006).  This Court is sensitive to the Public Officials’ \nconcern that relief ought be tailored to redress actually-\naffected projects, Defs.’ Opp’n 40, but, because all plaintiffs \nseek vacatur under the APA, this concern goes to the scope of \nany additional injunctive relief, rather than to the plaintiffs’ \nstanding to bring suit. \n \nD. Intervenor ACE NY Standing \nThe Public Officials argue that ACE NY also does not have \nstanding, because, under the associational standing theory it \nrelies on, it does not identify a specific member that would \nhave standing to sue in his or her own right, “presumably \n[26] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 27 of 49\nbecause [ACE NY has] not identified a member that has a pending \napplication that has been unlawfully delayed.”  Id. at 21.  The \nPublic Officials cavil with the declarations of ACE NY’s \nmembers, largely on the basis that purportedly harmed \nconstruction companies, leaseholders, and the like are not \nidentified by name, and their harms are too attenuated because \nthey are not themselves affected permit applicants.  Id. at 21-\n22.  The Public Officials also argue that companies or persons \nin the wind energy supply chain business are harmed only \nindirectly, by third parties’ choosing not to buy their products \nor utilize their services, and that such parties are not with \nthe zone of interests protected by the statutes at issue or \ndirectly regulated by the statutes.  Id. at 23.   \nMuch of this argument is dealt with supra, Section II.B: \nagain, all that is required is a procedural violation paired \nwith an injury that may possibly be redressed upon \nreconsideration.  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 518.  ACE NY has \nalleged that in spades.  See, e.g., Intervenor Compl. ¶ 76; \nWells Decl. ¶¶ 21-49.  Contra the Public Officials’ initial \ncontention, moreover, ACE NY has identified members affected by \nthe Wind Directive by name.  ACE NY Suppl. Br. 6-8.  This Court \nagain takes seriously the Public Officials’ concern that relief \nought be tailored to redress actually-affected projects, Defs.’ \nOpp’n 40, but judges that this argument goes more to remedy than \n[27] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 28 of 49\nstanding, as injury, traceability, and redressability have been \nfirmly established.  \n \nE. Zone of Interests and Extraneous Parties \nThe Public Officials also argue that the State Plaintiffs’ \nalleged injuries are outside the relevant statutes’ zone of \ninterests, given that the State Plaintiffs are not permit \napplicants under the statutes they invoke and their alleged \nharms do not flow from the kinds of environmental harms the \nrelevant statutes are designed to protect against, foreclosing \nstanding on statutory grounds.  Defs.’ Opp’n 18-19.  \nThe zone of interests test is not “especially demanding,” \nand only requires that plaintiffs be “arguably” within the zone \nof interests protected by the relevant statutes, such that “the \nbenefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff” and suit will be \nforeclosed on this grounds “‘only when a plaintiff’s “interests \nare so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes \nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed \nthat”’ Congress authorized the plaintiff to sue.”  Lexmark \nIntern., Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n130 (2014) (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi \nIndians v Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012)).  Confronted with \nthe same argument in the similar context of an oil and gas \nleasing pause challenged by a group of state plaintiffs, the \ndistrict court in Louisiana v. Biden declined to give the issue \n[28] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 29 of 49\nextended consideration: “Clearly, all of the Plaintiff States’ \ncauses of action against Government Defendants are within the \n‘zone of interests’ under the APA.”  622 F. Supp. 3d at 290-91.  \nThis Court agrees: the Plaintiff States and the wind industry \nplaintiffs represented by ACE NY all seek to vindicate interests \nat least marginally related to the invoked statutes, which all \nhave to do with some mix of environmental protection, \nresponsible energy production, and expeditious land development. \nThe Public Officials also argue that certain of the \nplaintiffs’ claims do not apply to certain defendants, as no \nspecific action or inaction is alleged as to the Department of \nEnergy and its Secretary, the Department of the Treasury and its \nSecretary, or the Department of Agriculture and its Secretary, \nand the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries all pertain to the \ntemporary cessation directive, not the interagency assessment \nand review component, which is the only action in which these \nagencies are involved.  Defs.’ Opp’n 19-20.  The Public \nOfficials similarly argue that the Bureau of Land Management \n(“BLM”) and its Director and the National Marine Fisheries \nService (“NMFS”) and its Director ought be dismissed from this \nsuit, as they are only vaguely alleged to have implemented the \ncessation directive, without being linked to any particular \npermit or authorization decision.  Id. at 20.    \n[29] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 30 of 49\nThis Court again hesitates to draw fine distinctions \nbetween parties at this stage, when the gist of the plaintiffs’ \nclaims is that all relevant agencies have implemented an \nunlawful and largely unexplained government-wide pause on all \nwind energy development and permitting.  ACE NY argues at length \nthat BLM has succumbed to a de facto unlawful revision of many \nof its land use plans, ACE NY Mem. 26-29, and implicates NMFS in \nthe allegedly unlawful permitting pause twice-over, id. at 29-\n30; see also States’ Mem. 3-4.  This Court draws the reasonable \ninference from the plaintiffs’ complaints that these agencies \nhave implemented the Wind Directive’s pause, causing harm to the \nplaintiffs.  See FAC ¶¶ 406-07, 412-13; Intervenor Compl. ¶¶ \n193, 196-97, 218-19.  As the plaintiffs have reminded this \nCourt, moreover, “the [factual] plausibility standard has no \nplace in APA review” because “[t]he relevant inquiry is . . . \nnot whether the facts set forth in a complaint state a plausible \nclaim but, rather, whether the administrative record \nsufficiently supports the agency’s decision.”  Atieh v. Riordan, \n727 F.3d 73, 76 (1st Cir. 2013).  This Court disagrees, \ntherefore, that these parties and their directors ought be \ndismissed at this stage. \nOn the other hand, neither the Plaintiff States nor ACE NY \nhas leveled any specific allegations against the Departments of \nAgriculture, Energy, or Treasury, or their secretaries, and it \n[30] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 31 of 49\nis hard to see how these agencies’ participation in a multi-\nagency review process could in itself be unlawful.  For this \nreason, therefore, this Court agrees that these Departments and \ntheir Directors ought be dismissed from this suit, and so \ndismisses them. \n \nF. Final Agency Action and the Notice-and-Comment \nRequirement \nThe Public Officials argue that the plaintiffs fail the \ntwo-prong test for identifying final agency action: that is, \nthat the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s \ndecision-making process and be one by which rights or \nobligations are determined or from which legal consequences \nflow.  Id. at 24; Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997).  \nInstead, they argue, the plaintiffs challenge a mix of the \ntemporary cessation-based “Wind Directive” itself, agency \nimplementation of the Wind Directive in the form of generalized \nnotices pertaining to it, and project-specific announcements \nimplementing it.  Id.  The Public Officials also point out that \nthe President is not an agency whose actions are reviewable \nunder the APA, and so argue that the Wind Directive itself is \nnot reviewable, and, for the same reasons, is not subject to the \nAPA’s notice-and-comment requirement; moreover, to the extent \nthat it can be construed as a rule, the Wind Directive simply \npauses authorizations pending future substantive assessment, \n[31] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 32 of 49\nrather than making any substantive changes itself, and thus \nrepresents a rule of agency procedure or practice rather than a \nsubstantive rule subject to notice-and-comment.  Id. at 24-25.  \nLikewise, the Public Officials argue, a generalized “halt on \nwind-energy approvals” is too amorphous to be challenged because \njudicial review of permitting decisions is generally limited to \nultimate approvals, modifications, or disapprovals of permit \napplications, notices to the public do not determine legal \nrights or obligations, and even project-specific notices do not \nrepresent the consummation of the agency’s decision-making \nprocess, but rather, temporarily defer decisions in contexts \nwhere the agency has discretion to do so and where no specific \ndeadline is provided by statute or, at least without significant \nexception, by regulation.  Id. at 26-30.  \nIn sum, the Public Officials argue that the plaintiffs’ \ncomplaints fit squarely within Lujan’s warning against lawsuits \nwholesale\nthat seek “  improvement of [agency] program[s] by court \ndecree,” rather than attacking specific, final agency actions.  \n497 U.S. at 891; Defs.’ Opp’n 30.  They also distinguish cases \nrelied on by the plaintiffs to establish that even temporary \nactions may be challenged on the grounds that the Public \nOfficials here do not argue that the Wind Directive is not final \nbecause it is temporary, but rather because no agency has made a \n[32] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 33 of 49\ndecision representing the consummation of its decision-making \nprocess or one with legal consequences.  Defs.’ Opp’n 30-31. \nThis Court will not exhaustively retread the ground covered \nby the district court in Louisiana v. Biden when faced with \nsimilar arguments.  622 F. Supp. 3d at 291-93.  “There is no \nreal question that [plaintiffs] have met the second prong of the \nBennett test because the [alleged] Stop [is an action] from \nwhich legal consequences will flow,” and a number of cases \nsupport the proposition that significant pauses and blanket \nmoratoria are final agency actions that cannot be exempted from \njudicial review merely by being characterized as intermediate.  \nId. at 291-92; see, e.g., Clean Air Council v. Pruitt, 862 F.3d \n1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (ruling that stay on rule’s implementation \nwas final action because it was “essentially an order delaying \nthe rule’s effective date, and [the D.C. Circuit] has held that \nsuch orders are tantamount to amending or revoking a rule”); \nNatural Res. Def. Council v. Wheeler, 955 F.3d 68, 79 (D.C. Cir. \n2020) (“[I]f an agency’s indication of an intent to reconsider \nan interim (or other action) sufficed to render the action non-\nfinal, agencies could evade judicial review of their actions . . \n. .”); see also Environmental Def. Fund, Inc. v. Gorsuch, 713 \nF.2d 802, 813 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“[S]uspension of the permit \nprocess as to a class of waste management facilities amounts to \na suspension of the effective date of regulation governing that \n[33] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 34 of 49\nclass, and may be reviewed . . . as the promulgation of a \nregulation.”).  This makes good sense: after all, could an \nindefinite “pause” on all agency action whatsoever be construed \nas intermediate and thus unreviewable?  See GianCarlo Canaparo, \nAdministrative Inertia After Regents and Department of Commerce, \n6 Admin. L. Rev. Accord 315, 334 & n.114 (2021) (observing, with \nrespect to the pause that was later challenged in Louisiana, 622 \nF. Supp. 3d, that “even [a] temporary moratorium may present a . \n. . problem” under recent, controlling Supreme Court case law, \nde facto\n“either because it is,  , final, or because it amounts to \nunlawful inaction,” on the theory that the affected agencies \nhave a statutory obligation to administer the impeded programs).   \nThis Court questioned the Public Officials at the June 18 \nhearing on this motion as to whether there was any timetable for \nthe interagency review process that must be completed before the \nWind Directive’s pause may be lifted, but the Public Officials \ndeclined to give one.  Instead of suggesting a reasonable \ntimeframe for, or indeed any end on the horizon to, the Wind \nDirective’s implementation, the Public Officials stressed the \ndistinction between this case and the pause-type cases the \nplaintiffs have relied on as comparators, see, e.g., Hornbeck \nOffshore Servs., LLC v. Salazar, 696 F. Supp. 2d 627 (E.D. La. \n2010) (granting preliminary injunction enjoining six-month pause \non deepwater drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico implemented \n[34] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 35 of 49\nfollowing Deepwater Horizon oil spill), on the grounds that this \npause is so far shorter, or has had fewer tangible consequences, \nor less directly conflicts with statutory commands, than the \npauses at issue in those cases.  For substantially the same \nreasons set out above in its imminence analysis with respect to \nstanding, however, see supra Section II.C, this Court does not \nfind the Public Officials’ proposed distinction between these \nother indefinite pause cases and this one persuasive.  Rather, \nit is persuaded that the Wind Directive’s pause, as alleged, is \nde facto final.   \n“Whether an agency action has ‘direct and appreciable legal \nconsequences’ under the second prong of Bennett is a ‘pragmatic’ \ninquiry.”  Sierra Club v. EPA, 955 F.3d 56, 63 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(quoting United States Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., \nInc., 578 U.S. 590, 598-99 (2016)).  “[A]n agency’s action will \nbe considered final if, looking to the practical effects, it \n‘appears on its face to be binding’ or if it ’is applied by the \nagency in a way that indicates it is binding.’  The ‘most \nimportant factor’ is ‘the actual legal effect (or lack thereof) \nof the agency action . . . on regulated entities.’”  National \nEduc. Ass’n v. United States Dep’t of Educ., No. 25-cv-091, 2025 \nWL 1188160, at *16 (D.N.H. Apr. 24, 2025) (quoting National \nMining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 252 (D.C. Cir. 2014)).  \nWhether or not the Wind Directive ultimately requires the \n[35] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 36 of 49\naffected agencies to act contrary to statute, it in effect \namends several regulations by requiring that the agencies must \nnot follow the usual, specified procedures for an unspecified \nperiod of time, enacting a kind of de facto suspension of the \nlaw with respect to wind energy development.  See Doe v. Trump, \n288 F. Supp. 3d 1045, 1070 (W.D. Wash. 2017) (“[W]hether the \n[challenged action] produces a ‘suspension’ or an indefinite \ndelay, the [action] has significant real-world impacts on \nPlaintiffs’ various situations.”).  Looking to the actual legal \neffects of the agencies’ actions -- that is, the indefinite \nsuspension of leasing and permitting for all wind energy \nprojects -- this Court rules that the agencies’ indefinite pause \non wind energy leasing and permitting, as alleged, constitutes \nfinal agency action.   \nAlthough closely related, this is distinct from the notice-\nand-comment issue.  The district court in Louisiana v. Biden \nconcluded that the indefinite pause on oil and gas leasing on \nfederal lands at issue there -- also implemented at the \nbeginning of a new presidential administration -- was a \nsubstantive rule subject to 5 U.S.C. § 553’s notice-and-comment \nrequirement, because, applying the relevant test, it “impose[d] \nrights and obligations and [did] not leave the agency and its \ndecisionmakers room to exercise discretion.”  622 F. Supp. 3d at \n295-96.  The court relied for this analysis at least in part on \n[36] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 37 of 49\nits determination that specific statutory timelines at issue had \nnot been met because of the challenged action, and on its more \ngeneral observation that the challenged Executive Order \n“eliminate[d] the agency’s discretion because exercising \ndiscretion would be disobeying a Presidential Executive Order.”  \nId. at 296.   \nThe Supreme Court has defined a “substantive rule” as “one \n‘affecting individual rights and obligations,’” such that it is \n“‘binding’ or ha[s] the ‘force of law.’”  Chrysler Corp. v. \nBrown, 441 U.S. 281, 301 (1979) (quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 \nU.S. 199, 232, 235, 236 (1974)).  The First Circuit has defined \n“a legislative rule (interchangeably called a substantive rule)” \nas “one that ‘creates rights, assigns duties, or imposes \nobligations, the basic tenor of which is not already outlined in \nthe law itself.’”  New Hampshire Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 887 F.3d \n62, 70 (1st Cir. 2018) (quoting La Casa Del Convaleciente v. \nSullivan, 965 F.2d 1175, 1178 (1st Cir. 1992)).  In the context \nof distinguishing between substantive and interpretive rules, \nanother session of this Court has observed that “[i]n \ndetermining whether a rule carries the ‘force of law,’ [and so \nis substantive rather than interpretive] the ‘critical factor’ \nis ‘whether it le[aves] the agency officials free to exercise \ndiscretion in an individual case’ or instead requires a uniform, \npredetermined outcome that admits of no exception.”  Monahan v. \n[37] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 38 of 49\nWinn, 276 F. Supp. 2d 196, 214 (D. Mass. 2003) (Gertner, J.) \n(quoting Charles H. Koch, Jr., 1 Admin L. & Prac. § 4.11 (2d ed. \n2003)).   \nThe Public Officials’ argument that the Wind Directive is, \nif anything, a rule of agency procedure or practice, rather than \na substantive rule subject to notice-and-comment, is addressed \nby the court in Louisiana only briefly, and dismissed based on \nthe court’s judgment that the challenged Executive Order \nmodified substantive rights and interests under the Fifth \nCircuit’s “substantial impact test.”  Id.  Along similar lines, \nACE NY points to case law addressing agency action that \n“effect[s] legal changes of general applicability” and \n“effectively nullif[ies] pre-existing regulations that were \nthemselves codified through notice-and-comment rulemaking,” \njudging this to be the stuff of substantive rules.  Pacito v. \nTrump, No. 2:25-cv-255, 2025 WL 655075, at *19 (W.D. Wash. Feb. \n28, 2025); ACE NY Mem. 23-24.   \nThis Court tentatively credits the plaintiffs’ notice-and-\ncomment argument, without ruling that the agency action in \nquestion here is a substantive rule at this stage.  “To \ndetermine the nature of a rule, the court must look at the \nrule’s effect on those interests ultimately at stake in the \nagency proceeding.  If a rule does not substantially affect or \njeopardize those ultimate interests, then it is procedural and \n[38] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 39 of 49\nnot substantive.  In short, context matters.”  Doe, 288 F. Supp. \n3d at 1074 (citations omitted).  The context here supports at \nleast the plausible inference that the Wind Directive is a \nsubstantive rule.  Unlike in cases where courts have found that \ntemporary suspensions of license applications did not constitute \nsubstantive rules, “focus[ing] on the fact that the delay caused \nby a suspension did not by itself undermine the interests at \nstake,” and that the challenged pauses were “related to the \nagencies’ ongoing notice and comment rulemaking efforts,” here \nthe plaintiffs allege that their interests are undermined with \nevery passing day of the challenged pause, and that there is \nlittle indication of whether or when the agencies will resume \nthe regular permitting processes that are (at least someday) \nrequired.  Id.  In the case which the Public Officials \nthemselves rely on to argue that the action challenged here is \nat most a rule of agency procedure or practice, the agency \nannounced its intent to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking \nwhen it implemented the pause, and clarified that “procedural \nfairness required that the processing of applications currently \non file be completed.”  Kessler v. F.C.C., 326 F.2d 673, 679 \n(D.C. Cir. 1963).  That is not the case here.  As alleged, the \nWind Directive appears to leave the affected agency officials no \ndiscretion to deviate from its strictures, effectively removing \n[39] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 40 of 49\nrights from the plaintiffs with no promise of a future \nrulemaking or clear timeline for resolution of their rights. \nAt the same time, particularly given the undeveloped nature \nof the arguments on this count, “whether notice and comment \nrulemaking was necessary in this case is an issue that requires \nan administrative record to properly resolve.”  J.O.P. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 19-1944, 2020 WL 2932922, at *17 (D. \nMd. June 3, 2020).   \nFor these reasons, the motion to dismiss is denied as to \nACE NY’s Count II. \n \nG. APA Pleading Challenge and Contrary to Law and Arbitrary \nor Capricious Claims \nGiven that “the [Rule 12(b)6 factual] plausibility standard \nhas no place in APA review,” and thus this Court is not to make \nfactual plausibility judgments as to the plaintiffs’ APA claims, \nbut only at most judgments as to whether “the underlying premise \nof the complaint is legally flawed (rather than factually \nunsupported),” the plaintiffs’ claims that the challenged agency \nactions were arbitrary or capricious and contrary to law do not \nrequire extended analysis here, as “[t]he focal point of APA \nreview is the existing administrative record.”  Atieh, 727 F.3d \nat 76 & n.4.  Related to the arguments addressed in the previous \nsection, however, the Public Officials argue generally that the \ncrux of the Plaintiff States’ claims belongs under 5 U.S.C. § \n[40] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 41 of 49\n706(1), which applies to agency actions unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed, and that the Plaintiffs’ failure to plead \nunder this section of the APA is both fatal to their claims and \nrevealing of their claims’ inadequacy, because that section \nrequires discrete, mandatory actions and egregious delay, such \nthat a four-month pause like the one at issue here simply would \nnot qualify.  Defs.’ Opp’n 31.   \nThis argument rests on the presumption that there was no \nfinal agency action here.  Id. at 32.  This Court has ruled \notherwise, so it does not discuss this argument at length.   \nIt is relevant to the plaintiffs’ 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A) and \n(C) contrary-to-law claim, however, that the district court in \nEnsco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, in the course of evaluating a 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(1) unreasonable delay challenge to a five-month \nmoratorium on deepwater drilling and permitting, reasoned that \n“[n]ot acting on permit applications seems contrary to OCSLA’s \ncommand that drilling development be ‘expeditious,’ and the \nAPA’s command that a permit must be processed ‘within a \nreasonable time.’”  781 F. Supp. 2d 332, 336-37 (E.D. La. 2011).  \n“Together,” the court observed, “OCSLA and the APA inform the \ngovernment’s action on permits and require that the government \nshould act expeditiously to advance development in the Outer \nContinental Shelf, and not to curtail drilling unpredictably or \nindefinitely.”  Id. at 337 (emphasis added).  For these reasons, \n[41] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 42 of 49\nthe court determined that OCSLA “establishes a non-discretionary \nduty on the Department of the Interior to act, favorably or \nunfavorably, on drilling permit applications,” such that “[n]ot \nacting at all is not a lawful option,” and adopted the \nplaintiff’s suggested thirty-day timeline for processing OCSLA \npermit applications, based on a deadline from a related statute.  \nId. at 336, 338-39.   \nDespite its factually distinguishable context -- the \ndrilling permitting requirements are different from those at \nissue here -- the reasoning of the court in Ensco supports the \nproposition that, even in a case not specifically challenging \nagency delay under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), an across-the-board pause \non wind energy-related permitting may be contrary to law even \nif, as the Public Officials argue, no hard-and-fast deadlines \nhave been violated.  In rejecting the government’s proposed \nrelegation of the unspecified permitting timelines to the \n“unchecked whim of the administrative process,” the court in \nEnsco judged that this view “would produce autocratic discretion \nat best,” observing that “[w]here there should be a queue, there \nis instead an untended pile.”  Id. at 339.  The court determined \ninstead that “Congress anticipated a process that would \ngenerally embrace a rational time frame for agency action; one \nfaithful to OCSLA’s mandate of expeditious development.”  Id. at \n339 (emphasis added).  The Public Officials here may object to \n[42] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 43 of 49\nthis implied characterization of the Wind Directive -- they have \nargued that the relevant agencies are reviewing and processing \nwind energy applications and requests without acting on them, so \ntheir piles are not entirely untended, Defs.’ Opp’n 3-4 -- and \nmay of course argue from the administrative record that the \nagencies have complied with the statutory and regulatory \nmandates even as they have stretched the previously established \npermit approval timelines.  On the facts alleged, however, the \nplaintiffs have stated a claim for agency action contrary to \nlaw.   \nThe Court therefore DENIES the motion to dismiss as to the \nPlaintiff States’ Count II and ACE NY’s Count III.  \nFor similar reasons, and given that the Public Officials do \nnot meaningfully contest the substance of the Plaintiff States’ \narbitrary-or-capricious claim under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) -- \nexcept to say that later decisions on specific permits will not \nbe arbitrary or capricious, Defs.’ Opp’n 32-33 -- this Court \nalso DENIES the motion to dismiss as to that claim, that is, \nPlaintiff States’ and ACE NY’s Count I.   \n \nH. Equitable, Ultra Vires, and Constitutional Claims \nThe Public Officials briefly dispose of the plaintiffs’ \nultra vires and equitable claims, arguing that they duplicate \nthe plaintiffs’ claim under the APA that the agencies have \nexceeded their statutory mandates and that these kinds of claims \n[43] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 44 of 49\ncannot be used to make an end-run around the final agency action \nrequirement.  Id. at 33.  The Public Officials also argue that \njudicial review as to any surviving ultra vires claim would in \nany case be limited, because the ultra vires doctrine only \napplies to “‘extreme’ agency error where the agency has stepped \nso plainly beyond the bounds of [its statutory authority], or \nacted so clearly in defiance of it, as to warrant the immediate \nintervention of an equity court,” New York v. McMahon, No. 25-\n10601, 2025 WL 1463009, at *23 (D. Mass. May 22, 2025) (Joun, \nJ.) (alteration in original) (quoting Federal Express Corp. v. \nUnited States Dep’t of Com., 39 F. 4th 756, 764 (D.C. Cir. \n2022)), and no patent misconstructions of statutes or specific, \nunambiguous statutory violations of this kind have been alleged.  \nId. at 34.    \nThis Court agrees with the Public Officials, and applies \nthis reasoning to ACE NY’s constitutional claim as well.  \n“[P]laintiffs’ concerns are better addressed by []other count[s] \nof their complaint,” that is, their APA claims.  Jafarzadeh v. \nNielsen, 321 F. Supp. 3d 19, 40 (D.D.C. 2018).  As to ACE NY’s \nconstitutional claim, because “judging the constitutionality of \naction taken by a coequal branch of government is ‘the gravest \nand most delicate duty that this Court is called on to \nperform,’” id. (quoting Northwest Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. \nOne v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 204 (2009)), “if a case can be \n[44] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 45 of 49\ndecided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional \nquestion, the other a question of statutory construction or \ngeneral law, the Court will decide only the latter,” Ashwander \nv. Tennessee Valley Auth., 297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, \nJ., concurring). \nLikewise, “because plaintiffs are able to assert the same \nclaim through the APA, they cannot obtain relief . . . through \nthe Court’s inherent power to review ultra vires agency \nactions.”  Jafarzadeh v. Duke, 270 F. Supp. 3d 296, 311 (D.D.C. \n2017).  Although, as another session of this Court has recently \nobserved, “ultra vires relief is designed to permit courts to \n‘reestablish the limits’ on executive authority when it acts \n‘beyond its authority,’” Victim Rights L.

Likewise, although “the Supreme Court has assumed \nwithout deciding that some ultra vires claims may lie against \npresidential action,” on balance “it is unclear whether ultra \nvires review is available at all” to challenge presidential \nactions, because the President is not an agency and courts \ngenerally may not enjoin the President.

Supp. 2d 58, 65 \n(D.D.C. 2007)), and rules that ultra vires action has not been \nplausibly alleged here. \nParticularly given that ACE NY collapses its constitutional \nand ultra vires claims into its APA-grounded contrary-to-law \nargument in its briefing, ACE NY Mem. 32, and the Plaintiff \nStates argue only from absence that “[n]othing in the \nConstitution or any act of Congress authorizes the President or \n[46] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 47 of 49\nAgency Defendants to categorically and indefinitely halt wind-\nenergy approvals,” States’ Mem. 33, this Court judges that \n“[t]his is a classic APA claim,” and that “[t]he specifics of \nplaintiffs’ allegations are a far better fit for this doctrinal \nbox,” within which “the Court will be able to consider the \nallegations fully.”  Nielsen, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 40.  It applies \nthis reasoning to the plaintiffs’ ultra vires and ACE NY’s \nconstitutional claims, and to the Plaintiff States’ equitable \nclaim for violations of federal law, which duplicates their \ncontrary-to-law claim under the APA.  \nThe Court therefore ALLOWS the motion to dismiss as to the \nPlaintiff States’ Counts III and IV and ACE NY’s Counts IV and \nV.  \n \nI. OCSLA Citizen Suit Claim (Plaintiff States’ Count V; \nIntervenor’s Count VI) \nThe Public Officials argue that OCSLA citizen suit claims \ncannot be brought until sixty days after giving the appropriate \nfederal official written notice of the alleged violation, and \nthat this requirement has not been met here.  Id. at 34-35.  The \n“imminent threat” or “immediate[] affect” exceptions to this \nrule do not apply, the Public Officials claim, because such \neffects could only happen after determinations are made only \npending OCSLA planning documents, and, moreover, the Plaintiffs \n[47] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 48 of 49\nidentify no mandatory deadline that has been violated.  Id. at \n35.   \nThis Court need not address the Public Officials’ arguments \nor any possible exhaustion issues, because the plaintiffs “have \nnot pursued and/or briefed this claim.  Additionally, the \ncitizen suit provision was not intended to operate as a means of \nobtaining ‘umbrella’ relief for a series of agency decisions \nthat were or will be subject to judicial review under the APA.”  \nLouisiana, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 296.  \nThis Court therefore ALLOWS the motion to dismiss as to the \nOCSLA citizen suit claims, that is, Plaintiff States’ Count V \nand ACE NY’s Count VI.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[48] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 162     Filed 07/03/25     Page 49 of 49\n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nThe Plaintiffs sue the Public Officials for violations of \nthe APA, for statutory violations in equity, for ultra vires \naction under the common law, for unconstitutional action in \nusurping congressional powers and seizing property without due \nprocess, and for an OCSLA violation under the statute’s citizen \nsuit provision.  The Public Officials move to dismiss all \ncounts. \nThis Court DENIES the Public Officials’ motion to dismiss, \nECF No. 123, as to the Plaintiff States’ Counts I and II and ACE \nNY’s Counts I, II, and III. \nThis Court ALLOWS the Public Officials’ motion to dismiss \nas to the Plaintiff States’ Counts III, IV, and V and ACE NY’s \nCounts IV, V, and VI. \nSO ORDERED. \n                 _/s/ William G.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 53     Filed 05/12/25     Page 1 of 7\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS \n  \n     \nSTATE OF NEW YORK, et al., \n     \nPlaintiffs, \n   No. 25-cv-11221-FDS \nv.   \n  \nDONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as  \nPresident of the United States, et al., \n \nDefendants.  \n \n  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and Local Rule 7.1, plaintiffs New York, \nMassachusetts, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, \nIllinois, Maine, Maryland, the People of the State of Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New \nMexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington (States) respectfully move for a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining Agency Defendants from implementing, relying in whole or in part, or \notherwise giving effect to Section 2(a) of the Presidential Memorandum entitled Temporary \nWithdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review \nof the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects, 90 Fed. Reg. \n8363 (Jan. 29, 2025) (the Wind Directive), to halt or otherwise impede development of wind-\nenergy projects in the States and off the coasts of the States.  \nThe States satisfy the requirements for preliminary injunctive relief. First, the States are \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Wind Directive itself and the implementation \nof and reliance on the Wind Directive by Agency Defendants are unlawful in multiple respects. \nAs explained in the accompanying memorandum of law, Agency Defendants’ implementation of \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 53     Filed 05/12/25     Page 2 of 7\nand reliance on the Wind Directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act because it is \narbitrary and capricious and violates the statutes governing wind-energy permitting and approvals. \nAdditionally, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation thereof are ultra vires. \nSecond,  the  States  will  suffer  immediate  irreparable  harm  absent  preliminary  relief. \nAgency Defendants’ halt of wind-energy development will hinder the States’ ability to secure \nreliable and affordable electricity; strand billions of dollars in States’ investments and impede \neconomic development; obstruct the States’ abilities to meet their clean-energy and climate goals; \nand delay reductions in emissions that harm public health. Indeed, the threat of these harms has \nsharply mounted in recent weeks as Agency Defendants have frozen ongoing construction and \nchilled investment in pending wind-energy projects, and now threaten the very existence of the \nnascent offshore-wind industry in particular. \nThird, the balance of the equities and public interest weigh heavily in favor of a preliminary \ninjunction. The requested injunction will only require Agency Defendants to resume processing \nand issuing decisions on wind-energy permits and approvals, allowing for the lawful development \nof  wind  energy.  On  the  other  hand,  without  the  requested  injunction,  Agency  Defendants’ \ncontinued  implementation  of  and  reliance  on  the  Wind  Directive  will  cause  the  States  the \nirreparable harms described above. There is also a strong public interest in, and no countervailing \ninterest against, stopping Agency Defendants’ unlawful conduct. \nThe States further request that the Court exercise its discretion to waive posting bond under \nRule 65(c). See, e.g., Int’l Assoc. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v.

In doing so, the Administration has arbitrarily and \nneedlessly frozen hundreds of wind energy projects, both in offshore waters and on onshore \npublic and private lands, threatening billions of dollars in investment and hundreds of thousands \nof American jobs. Plaintiff-Intervenor Alliance for Clean Energy New York (“ACE NY”) seeks \na preliminary injunction restraining this illegal action, and supports State Plaintiffs’ related \nmotion. \nACE NY is likely to succeed on the merits; the Wind Ban is unlawful several times over. \nIt lacks any supporting administrative record, reflects zero legal analysis or factual findings, and \nwas implemented by agencies in flagrant violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”). It conflicts with longstanding Congressional and agency policy across multiple \nAdministrations, singles out the American wind industry for adverse treatment not accorded to \nany other energy source, and was adopted without regard to its harms to the industry and \nconsumers and notwithstanding its high costs (to industry, the States, and the public) and \nnegligible benefits. The Wind Ban is arbitrary especially viewed against the Administration’s \ncontemporaneous actions, including its declaration of an “energy emergency” and need for a \n“reliable, diversified and affordable” energy supply.2 Indeed, wind energy is well-situated to \n \n1 Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind \nLeasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind \nProjects, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,363 (Jan. 29, 2025) (“Presidential Memorandum”).   \n2 Declaring a National Energy Emergency, (Jan. 20, 2025); Establishing the National Energy \nDominance Council, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,945 (Feb. 14, 2025). \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 13 of 50\n \n \naddress such objectives as a proven, reliable, low-cost, and environmentally sound domestic \nenergy source that already comprises an appreciable and growing share of the nation’s energy \nsupply. And while demanding that all wind permitting cease until completion of some new \nenvironmental and economic “comprehensive assessment and review” with no deadline, the \nAdministration is taking steps to expedite other forms of energy (e.g., oil, gas, and coal) and has \nstated no similar concern about “potential inadequacies” under the same environmental review \nprocesses applicable to those sources as to wind. Above all, Congress has simply not delegated \nto the President or agencies any power to threaten an entire industry with ruin: the Ban is ultra \nvires root and branch. Agencies have no legal authority to indefinitely abdicate their \nCongressionally and regulatorily imposed obligations to timely issue decisions on wind energy \nprojects.   \nThis case also satisfies the remaining preliminary injunction factors. As to irreparable \nharm, the Wind Ban has caused severe economic damage to the wind industry, from developers \nof wind projects to suppliers of components to businesses and workers who support construction \nprojects. That harm escalates every day the Wind Ban continues, and threatens catastrophic harm \nto the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, resuming wind permitting in the normal course while this \nlitigation proceeds would harm no one, particularly as those projects are already subject to robust \nlegal requirements and extensive studies, so the balance of equities favors injunctive relief. \nAllowing wind energy permitting to continue as Congress directed also is in the public interest, \nespecially given the critical role wind energy plays in improving grid reliability and security and \nharnessing renewable sources to meet increasing domestic energy demands. The Administration \ncan conduct a redundant and wasteful comprehensive study if it so wishes, but not as a pretext \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 14 of 50\n \n \nfor prejudging the outcome and attempting to shut down all wind energy projects. Accordingly, \nthis Court should enjoin the Wind Ban pending its final resolution of this case on the merits. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Wind Ban represents a targeted and irrational attack on one of American’s fastest \ngrowing, lowest cost, and environmentally safest energy sources. Wind currently provides 10.1 \npercent of the nation’s electricity, and will make up a significant portion of the estimated 1,000 \nTWh of new electricity needed by 2035 to meet growing demand. The wind industry directly and \nindirectly supports more than 300,000 U.S. jobs, including 20,000 wind manufacturing jobs at \nover 450 facilities. In 2023 alone, the U.S. wind industry invested at least $10 billion in new \nprojects, and it delivers nearly $2 billion in state and local tax and land lease payments each \nyear.3  \nWind energy is critical to energy security and independence, reducing air emissions, and \nimproving power grid reliability and energy resource diversity.4 Wind is an affordable energy \nsource, diversifies states’ energy mix, and is not “intermittent” (as the Presidential Memorandum \navers) but rather more dependable in many respects than other sources.5 The environmental and \neconomic benefits associated with wind energy development have been recognized by Congress \nand state and local governments, which have taken measures to incentivize the growth of wind \nenergy. For over two decades, across numerous Administrations, Congress has declared it the \npolicy of the United States to support wind energy research, development, and deployment, and \n \n3 Wells Decl., ¶ 6. \n4 See U.S. Department of Energy, How Wind Can Help Us Breathe Easier,  \nhttps://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/how-wind-can-help-us-breathe-easier. \n5 Goggin Decl., ¶¶ 9-14, 28-39; McNutt Decl., Exhibit B, Understanding the Impact of the \nPresidential Memorandum on the Wind Industry at 13.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 15 of 50\n \n \nhas enacted multiple tax incentives to advance wind energy.6 Thirty states and the District of \nColumbia have active renewable or clean energy requirements, and “[a] recent analysis of state \nprograms revealed 19 states that had a total of 26 programs specific to attracting renewable \nenergy companies.”7  \nI.  WIND ENERGY IS WELL UNDERSTOOD AND SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE \nSAFEGUARDS.   \nWind energy has been thoroughly studied for many years and is one of the most \nsustainable ways to generate energy. The federal permitting process for wind energy projects is \ndesigned to minimize the impacts of those projects.   \nOffshore Wind. Before leasing and authorizing construction of wind energy projects on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”), a component \nof the Department of the Interior, works with other federal agencies, states, tribes, and the public \nto ensure that each project undergoes thorough environmental review.  \nTo date, BOEM has approved eleven commercial-scale offshore wind projects. Each \nproject undergoes multiple levels of environmental review. During initial planning and analysis, \nBOEM publishes a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Assessment (“EA”) of the \npotential impacts of site assessment and site characterization activities in a geographic area (e.g. \nthe New York Bight) proposed for offshore wind leasing. BOEM then publishes a draft EA of its \n \n6 See Energy Tax Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-618 (1978); Energy Policy Act of 2005, Pub.

This process typically takes approximately two years, after which BOEM \nholds competitive lease auctions. \nOnce leases have been issued, each lessee conducts BOEM-approved site assessment and \ncharacterization of its lease area and potential export cable routing options. Each lessee then may \npropose a Construction and Operations Plan (“COP”) for development of an offshore wind \nproject and submit it to BOEM for a completeness review to ensure there is sufficient data and \nanalysis to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements. Each COP is updated several times \nbefore being declared complete. This stage takes approximately three to five years. \nFor each proposed COP that BOEM deems sufficient and complete, BOEM prepares an \nEnvironmental Impact Statement (“EIS”), which entails a project-specific assessment of the \npotential biological, socioeconomic, physical, and cultural impacts that could result from the \nconstruction and subsequent operation of the wind project. During this process BOEM consults \nwith federal agencies including the National Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”) and U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; the Environmental \nProtection Agency (“EPA”) under the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act; and the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) under the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act. \nBOEM also conducts a consultation process under Section 106 of the National Historic \nPreservation Act (“NHPA”), and consults with other federal agencies, tribes, states, and \nlocalities. Based on all that input, BOEM prepares a draft EIS that analyzes potential effects of \nthe proposed project on air quality, bats and birds, benthic resources, coastal habitat and fauna, \nfish and essential fish habitat, marine mammals, sea turtles, scenic and visual resources, water \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 17 of 50\n \n \nquality, wetlands, cultural resources, socioeconomics, and other topics. That draft EIS is \npublished and subjected to public meetings and comments. BOEM then issues a final EIS, in \nconsultation with cooperating agencies, and incorporates or addresses these comments, including \nby providing mitigation conditions.  The EIS process takes approximately one to two years.8 \n  After these in-depth reviews, BOEM and other agencies have repeatedly determined that \nwind energy projects may be conducted safely and consistent with other OCS uses. Indeed, the \ngovernment has successfully defended the sufficiency of its review and accuracy of its \nconclusions in every court case to date deciding claims against offshore wind projects.

These \nprojects have likewise undergone extensive environmental review.9 BLM prepared a \nprogrammatic environmental impact statement (“PEIS”) of the impacts associated with wind \nenergy development on the roughly 20 million acres of public lands in 11 western states with \nwind energy potential.10 This review analyzed “the positive and negative environmental, social, \n \n8 See also Declaration of Maria Hartnett, Epsilon Associates, Exhibit B, “Adequacy of the \nFederal Offshore Wind Permitting and Environmental Review Processes” (May 8, 2025) (further \ndetailing BOEM’s wind energy processes and steps to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts). \n9 In addition to BLM review, ROW grantees may be required to obtain additional authorization, \nsuch as an incidental take statement issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a CWA \nSection 404 permit issued by the Corps, and additional permits required by states and tribal \ngovernments. \n10 BOEM, Wind Energy Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (2005), \nhttps://windeis.anl.gov/documents/fpeis/index.cfm.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 18 of 50\n \n \nand economic impacts; discussion of relevant mitigation measures to address these impacts; and \nidentification of appropriate, programmatic policies and best management practices to be \nincluded” in the 52 land use plans amended in the course of BLM’s review.11 BLM has \nconsistently concluded that it is appropriate to allow wind development on federal lands because \nadverse effects are few and can be effectively mitigated, and “[t]he potential impacts of wind \nenergy development on local and regional economies would be largely beneficial.”12 \nBefore approving any specific project, BLM conducts a project-specific EA or EIS that \nassesses potential environmental effects, including effects to air quality, bat populations and \nroosting habitat, avian populations, eagles, greater sage-grouse, climate and greenhouse gas \nemissions, endangered and threatened species, wetlands, cultural resources, and other topics. The \nreview also considers socioeconomic factors such as employment, local and regional economies, \nresidential property values, fire and fuels management, livestock, and recreation.13 BLM has \nrepeatedly and successfully defended its review of wind energy projects on BLM lands, \nestablishing that its review properly addresses environmental effects.

Of land-based wind projects, 99% occur on non-federal lands. The federal \ngovernment itself has recognized that “[w]ind energy projects provide many economic benefits” \nto states and local communities.15 These benefits include “direct and indirect employment, land \nlease payments, local tax revenue, and lower electricity rates–plus other financial incentives…. \nWind energy projects create jobs and provide a revenue source for farmers and ranchers—which \ncan be spent in the neighboring community.”16  \nRegulation of wind projects on private property primarily implicates issues of land use \nand economic development that are within the historic police power of states and localities. \nThese states and localities have their own environmental and public safety laws, so that projects \non non-federal lands typically undergo extensive environmental and public interest review. The \npresence of wetlands, endangered species, or eagles may implicate the limited jurisdiction of the \nCorps or USFWS. In such circumstances, these federal agencies conduct NEPA review before \ntaking action, but the relevant environmental impacts analyzed are typically limited to the \nspecific activity requiring a federal permit (i.e., impacts to wetlands and protected wildlife). It is \nthe role of state and local permitting authorities, not the federal government, to determine \nwhether a particular wind energy project makes sense for their communities. \nII.  DEFENDANTS’ UNLAWFUL ACTIONS TO END ALL WIND PERMITTING. \nDespite the wind energy industry’s unparalleled history of safety and success, a \nPresidential Memorandum issued on Inauguration Day instructed all agencies to abruptly cease \nall wind energy permitting nationwide. 90 Fed. Reg. at 8,363. The sole grounds for this \nunprecedented order are “alleged” (and unspecified) “legal deficiencies underlying the Federal \n \n15 WINDExchange, Economics and Incentives for Wind, U.S. Department of Energy, \nhttps://windexchange.energy.gov/projects/economics. \n16 Id. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 20 of 50\n \n \nGovernment’s leasing and permitting of … wind projects,” along with “potential” (and likewise \nunspecified) “inadequacies in various environmental reviews.” Id. (emphasis added). The \nMemorandum asserts that the Wind Ban is necessary during a new, open-ended “comprehensive \nassessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices.” Id. It fails to mention, \nand in no way accounts for, the robust, years-long reviews already required for wind projects and \ncourts’ uniform rejection to date of alleged legal deficiencies. The Memorandum sets no \ntimeframe for this assessment; in fact, there are no reported updates on its status in the several \nmonths following its issuance. Indeed, in light of campaign promises to “end” the offshore wind \nindustry and ensure that “no [wind turbines] are being built,”17 it appears that the Wind Ban only \nserves as an unlawful, extra-statutory, indefinite prohibition on wind energy development.  \nFederal agencies promptly set about implementing the Wind Ban, as evidenced by the \ncessation of all wind energy leasing, permitting, and approval processes across agencies, as well \nas actions to stop fully approved projects. Indeed, agencies have publicly announced that they are \nimplementing the Wind Ban, but without citing any legal basis for their actions. For example, \nBOEM, the lead federal agency for offshore wind projects, on its website expressly states that \n“[t]he Department of the Interior and BOEM are implementing President Trump’s \nmemorandum temporarily halting offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. The \nmemorandum also pauses new or renewed approvals, rights-of-way, permits, leases, or loans for \noffshore wind projects pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices.”18 \n \n17 See, e.g., Sara Dorn, Trump Calls Windmills ‘An Economic And Environmental Disaster’ In \nLatest Rant Against Turbines, FORBES (Jan. 15, 2025); Lisa Friedman & Brad Plumer, Trump \nPromises To End New Wind Farms, New York Times (Jan. 7, 2025); Trump vows to target \noffshore wind from “day one,” Boston Herald (May 12, 2024). \n18 BOEM, Lease and Grant Information, https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/lease-and-\ngrant-information. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 21 of 50\n \n \nLikewise based on the Presidential Memorandum, BOEM has declared that it will not be holding \npublic NEPA meetings related to wind energy development19 and that it is choosing to miss or \nextend permitting milestones on the permitting dashboards for offshore wind projects.20 \n  The Corps publicly acknowledged its stoppage of all new Clean Water Act jurisdictional \ndeterminations, environmental assessments, public notices, and other permitting activities only \nfor wind projects. A press article issued on February 12, 2025, quoted an email from a Corps \nspokesman stating that “[t]he pause was lifted for renewable projects, and the pause remains in \nplace for wind and wind-related projects in accordance with the attached Executive Order.” The \narticle states that the latter reference is to the January 20 Presidential Memorandum.21  \n  On January 23, 2025, USFWS posted the following notice on its website: “The U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service, pursuant to Presidential Memorandum ‘Temporary Withdrawal of All \nAreas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal \nGovernment’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects’ is temporarily ceasing \nissuance of eagle permits to wind facilities until further notice. In the interim, ePermits will no \nlonger automatically issue general permits.”22 USFWS’s spreadsheet tracking eagle incidental \ntake permits issued for wind projects lists 111 permits issued in 2024 and six issued in 2025, so \n \n19 BOEM, POSTPONED: Public Meetings on Draft Environmental Review of Potential \nMitigation of Future Development of Wind Lease Areas Offshore California (Jan. 28, 2025), \nhttps://www.boem.gov/newsroom/notes-stakeholders/postponed-public-meetings-draft-\nenvironmental-review-potential (cancelling public meetings for California Wind PEIS); BOEM, \n“Vineyard Mid-Atlantic”  https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/vineyard-\nmid-atlantic (cancelling public meetings for Vineyard Mid-Atlantic project). \n20 Id.   \n21 Bobby Magill, New Wind Farms Singled Out in Army Corps Water Permitting Pause, \nBloomberg Law (Feb. 12, 2025), https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/new-\nwind-farms-singled-out-in-army-corps-water-permitting-pause.  \n22 USFWS, “Eagle Incidental Take: General Permit,” https://www.fws.gov/service/3-200-71-\neagle-incidental-take-general-permit.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 22 of 50\n \n \nthat the agency had been issuing such permits at a pace of approximately nine per month. On \ninformation and belief, no such permits have been issued since January 20, 2025. Moreover, on \ninformation and belief, USFWS has stopped issuing technical assistance letters for all wind \nprojects. \n  NOAA and NMFS’s February 2024 “Monthly Status Report” for an offshore project’s \nIncidental Take Assessment under the MMPA provides that MMPA related milestones are being \nextended by three months on account of the “executive order entitled ‘Temporary Withdrawal Of \nAll Areas On The Outer Continental Shelf From Offshore Wind Leasing And Review Of The \nFederal Government's Leasing And Permitting Practices For Wind Projects.’”23 The notice \nprovides that “these dates may need to be revisited, depending on timing of the comprehensive \nassessment and review required by the January 20 Executive Order,” and stated \nthat “the Department of Commerce ‘shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, \npermits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a \ncomprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices.’”24   \n  EPA likewise has cited to the Presidential Memorandum in the context of EPA’s offshore \nair permitting decisions under the Clean Air Act, noting its intent to “reconsider [an offshore \nwind project] permit decision in light of the Presidential Memorandum” and without any \nreference to air quality concerns within EPA’s jurisdiction.25 \n \n23 Permitting Dashboard, MMPA Incidental Take Authorization, \nhttps://www.permits.performance.gov/proj/southcoast-wind-energy-llc-southcoast-wind/marine-\nmammal-protection-act-mmpa-incidental-take (milestone nonconformance explanation) (citing \nEx.

The agencies also have provided no opportunity for the \npublic to comment on actions that amount to dramatic regulatory and policy reversals. \nARGUMENT \nA preliminary injunction is necessary to stop the ongoing harm caused by the Wind Ban, \nincluding to ACE NY and its members. To issue a preliminary injunction, the Court considers \n(1) Plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits, (2) Plaintiff’s likely irreparable harm absent  \npreliminary relief, (3) lack of harm to other parties from an injunction; and (4) the public interest \nfavoring an injunction. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); NuVasive, Inc. v. \nDay, 954 F.3d 439, 443 (1st Cir. 2020). All four elements are readily met here. Consequently, \nthis Court should enjoin agencies’ implementation of the Wind Ban while this litigation \nproceeds. \nI.  ACE NY IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS. \nLikelihood of success on the merits is “the most important of the four preliminary \ninjunction factors.” Norris on behalf of A.M. v. Cape Elizabeth Sch. Dist., 969 F.3d 12, 22 (1st \nCir. 2020). To issue a preliminary injunction, the court need not “conclusively determine the \nmerits of the underlying claims,” Ross-Simons of Warwick v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 16 (1st \nCir. 1996). “[A] court’s conclusions as to the merits of the issues presented on a preliminary \ninjunction are to be understood as statements of probable outcomes.” Narragansett Indian Tribe \nv. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1991). ACE NY is likely to succeed on the merits of its \nclaims.  \nA.  ACE NY Has Standing. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 24 of 50\n \n \nACE NY has associational standing because at least one of its members can establish \nstanding and the other requirements of associational standing are met. Am. Clinical Lab. Ass’n v. \nBecerra, 40 F.4th 616 (D.C. Cir. 2022); Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence Corp. \nv. School Committee for the City of Boston, 89 F.4th 46 (1st Cir. 2023). That is, ACE NY is a \nleading national trade association representing developers of offshore and onshore wind projects \nrequiring federal approvals that the Wind Ban now categorically and indefinitely prohibits, as \nwell as other members of the wind energy industry injured in fact by this prohibition. The \ninability to obtain permits and approvals jeopardizes ACE NY’s members’ projects and \nbusinesses, including as discussed in Section II below and the Declarations of Marguerite Wells \n(ACE NY), Elizabeth Burdock (Oceantic Network), Charles Donadio (Atlantic Wind Transfers), \nand Kara McNutt (Wood Mackenzie). These injuries would not exist but for the delays caused by \nthe Wind Ban. Enjoining the Wind Ban would result in agencies’ resumption of permitting for \nwind energy in the normal course, without needing to await completion of a vacuous, redundant, \nand likely pretextual new “comprehensive assessment and review” of wind projects’ \nenvironmental and economic effects. ACE NY’s members also are directly regulated by the \nstatutes that the Wind Ban violates, sufficing for prudential standing. Match-E-Be-Nash-She-\nWish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012). \nB.  Each Agency’s Blanket Implementation of the Wind Ban Is a Final Agency \nAction Reviewable Under the APA. \nEach individual agency decision to cease issuing new or renewed approvals, ROWs, \npermits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind development constitutes a discrete final \nagency action that is subject to judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Agencies’ adoption \nof the Wind Ban (1) marks the consummation of the agency's decision-making processes and \n(2) determines rights or obligations or create legal consequences. Harper v. Werfel, 118 F.4th \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 25 of 50\n \n \n100, 116 (1st Cir. 2024). The courts apply these finality factors against the backdrop of \nCongress’s “evident intent [in enacting the APA] to make agency action presumptively \nreviewable.” Clarke v. Securities Industry Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388 (1987).  \nThe Wind Ban has far-reaching legal consequences, including a “direct and immediate … \neffect on the day-to-day business” of ACE NY’s members. FTC v. Standard Oil Co., 449 U.S. \n232, 239 (1980). An agency’s decision to categorically suspend statutory programs or activities \nis reviewable under the APA. Louisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp.3d 267, 292 (W.D. La. 2022). As \nexplained supra, agencies have taken tangible action to implement the Wind Ban. Such action is \njudicially reviewable regardless of whether it is formally announced or taken sub silentio. \n“Precedent … is clear that the APA allows challenges to unwritten agency policies and \npractices.” State v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01144 (JAV), 2025 WL 573771 at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, \n2025); Louisiana, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 292. \nMoreover, the Wind Ban’s self-labeling as a “Temporary Cessation” has no bearing on its \njusticiability. “[T]he fact that the challenged actions are ostensibly temporary is immaterial—for \n… all agency actions are subject to future change.” Pacito v. Trump, No. 25-255, 2025 WL \n655075, at *16 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025). Interim agency action “counts as consummation of \nagency decisionmaking for finality purposes” where it “firmly establishes [the agency’s] current \nposition.” NRDC v. Wheeler, 955 F.3d 68, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2020). In response to a challenge to a \nsimilar Executive Order that directed the Interior Department to “pause” new oil and gas leases \non public lands or in offshore waters, a court explained that “a ‘final agency action’ does not \nhave to be defined as permanent to be considered final.” Louisiana, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 292 \n(citing numerous cases supporting this holding).  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 26 of 50\n \n \nFinally, the Wind Ban does not escape judicial review simply because it stems from the \nPresidential Memorandum. Nothing in the APA or caselaw prevents or exempts review of an \nagency action simply because it implements a presidential directive. Pacito, 2025 WL 655075, at \n*15; Louisiana, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 294-295. Exempting agency action from APA oversight just \nbecause it purports to carry out presidential policy “would allow the President and agencies to \nsimply reframe agency action as orders or directives originating from the President to avoid APA \nreview.” AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. U.S. Dep't of State, No. CV 25-00400, 2025 WL 485324, \nat *5 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, 2025). \nC.  The Wind Ban Is Arbitrary and Capricious. \nACE NY will demonstrate that the Wind Ban is unlawful and should be set aside as \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). Judicial review under the APA is based on the administrative record of the federal \ngovernment. Id. § 706 (“the court shall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a \nparty”). An agency action is arbitrary and capricious “if the agency has relied on factors which \nCongress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \nagency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of \nagency expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983); see also Melone v. Coit, 100 F.4th 21, 29 (1st Cir. 2024). Agency actions are \narbitrary and capricious also where there is “[u]nexplained inconsistency” by the agency, Encino \nMotorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 222 (2016), or failure to provide a “reasoned \nexplanation” for a change in policy, FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 \n(2009).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 27 of 50\n \n \nThe government must offer a “satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’” Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, \n292 (2024). The Court’s “inquiry … is to be searching and careful.” Citizens to Preserve \nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971). The Court must determine if the agency’s \naction was “consonant with [its] statutory powers, reasoned, and supported by substantial \nevidence in the record.” Associated Fisheries of Me. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997). \nThis review “is not a rubber stamp; in order to avoid being deemed arbitrary and capricious, an \nagency decision must be rational.” Citizen Awareness Network, Inc. v. Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, 59 F.3d 284, 290 (1st Cir. 1995). \nThe Wind Ban fails the arbitrary and capricious test multiple times over. The agencies \nthemselves have offered no explanation for their decisions to halt all wind-related permitting, \nmuch less the “satisfactory” explanation required by law. Ohio, 603 U.S. at 292. Nor is there any \nevidence that the agencies deliberated before abandoning their permitting processes for all new \nwind projects. Cf. New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-39-JJM-PAS, 2025 WL 715621 at *12 (D.R.I. \nMar. 6, 2025) (“abrupt” implementation of “blanket pause” on federal funding without \nexplanation is arbitrary and capricious). \nNor does the Presidential Memorandum supply a rationale supporting the Wind Ban. Its \none-paragraph Section 2(a) directs the Wind Ban due to “various alleged legal deficiencies \nunderlying the Federal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind \nprojects” and “potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews” that “may lead to . . .  \nnegative impacts on navigational safety interests, transportation interests, national security \ninterests, commercial interests, and marine mammals.” 90 Fed. Reg at 8,363 (emphasis added). \nTo address these illusory concerns, it directs a “comprehensive assessment and review of Federal \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 28 of 50\n \n \nwind leasing and permitting practices” that considers “the environmental impact of onshore and \noffshore wind projects upon wildlife, including, but not limited to, birds and marine mammals” \nand “the economic costs associated with the intermittent generation of electricity and the effect \nof subsidies on the viability of the wind industry.” Id. The Administration and federal agencies \nhave provided no other public explanation for the Wind Ban, and any post hoc justifications they \nmay now advance should be given little weight. “[T]he focal point for judicial review should be \nthe administrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in the \nreviewing court.” Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142 (1973). \nTo the extent that these statements can be considered justifications, they are arbitrary and \ncapricious. First, the Wind Ban arbitrarily creates “[u]nexplained inconsistenc[ies]” with prior \npolicies. Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 222 (2016). The Wind Ban conflicts with \nlongstanding agency policy that agencies should encourage renewable energy development on \npublic lands and prioritize the processing of applications for energy development. See, e.g., \nRights-of-Way, Leasing, and Operations for Renewable Energy, 89 FR 35634 (May 1, 2024) \n(noting that the rule’s purpose was to “promote the greatest use of wind and solar energy \nresources”); 33 C.F.R. § 320.4 (directing the Corps “to give high priority to the processing of \npermit actions involving energy projects”). Moreover, the suggestion that agencies’ wind-related \nNEPA analyses might be legally deficient represents a drastic and wholly unexplained departure \nfrom the position the government has taken, and courts have endorsed, in litigation. Defendant \nagencies have thoroughly analyzed wind energy and zealously defended their wind permitting \nprograms, and the individual permitting decisions arising therefrom, successfully arguing that \nenvironmental review processes satisfy all statutory obligations. See supra Section I; ACE NY \nComplaint ¶¶ 38-57. Permitting for all large-scale energy projects face lawsuits—including the \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 29 of 50\n \n \nvery energy sources that the Administration is pushing to develop while prohibiting wind \nenergy—so the existence of such litigation is unremarkable and does not justify the agencies’ \nactions. The lack of any acknowledgement—let alone a reasoned explanation—for the \ngovernment’s sudden and unexplained reversal on these issues renders the reversal arbitrary and \nunlawful. Fox, 556 U.S. at 515-16. \n Second, the vague suppositions underpinning the Wind Ban, including that wind energy \nmight be harmful to the environment and wildlife, are unsupported by any administrative record \nand have no basis in fact.

The Wind Ban ignores the vast body of research demonstrating that wind energy \nis a safe and environmentally sound technology with extensive benefits to the public.26 \nMoreover, as detailed supra, the federal agencies responsible for authorizing and permitting \nwind energy on public and private lands have themselves concluded time and again after \nthorough analysis that wind energy development is on balance beneficial and that any effects on \nimpacts on wildlife or the environment are modest and can be mitigated. The federal government \nhas failed to identify any evidence that indicates that the American wind industry poses an acute \n \n26 Dep’t of Energy, Fact Sheet: Wind Energy Benefits, \nhttps://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/62823.pdf (Jan. 2015) (“Researchers estimate that wind \nenergy in the United States in 2013 reduced direct power-sector carbon dioxide emissions by 115 \nmillion metric tons, equivalent to eliminating the emissions of 20 million cars during the year.”); \nRyan Wiser et al, LAND-BASED WIND MARKET REPORT, Lawrence Berkeley National \nLaboratory (2024), https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/Land-\nBased%20Wind%20Market%20Report_2024%20Edition.pdf (finding that, in 2023, wind \nenergy’s combined climate, health, and grid benefits averaged $183/MWh); see also Dev \nMillstein et al., Climate and air quality benefits of wind and solar generation in the United States \nfrom 2019 to 2022, 1 CELL REPORTS SUSTAINABILITY 5-6 (2024) (finding that, from \n2019-2022, wind and solar energy provided $249 billion in environmental benefits and helped to \nprevent between 1,200 and 1,600 premature deaths in the United States). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 30 of 50\n \n \nand impending threat to any resource, much less warranting an across-the-board emergency \nstoppage of all federal permitting activities for wind energy. To the extent that a particular wind \ninstallation could have environmental effects, those effects are identified and analyzed by the \nexisting (and comprehensive) federal environmental review process for wind projects, which \noperates to avoid, minimize, and mitigate such effects.27   \nTellingly, the Wind Ban inexplicably excludes all other energy sources from the \nsupposed comprehensive review, even though these other sources have, at a minimum, equal \npotential to cause environmental harm and are generally subject to the same environmental \nstatutes. Indeed, on the same day that the Administration singled out the wind industry for \nadverse treatment with the Wind Ban, the Administration declared a national energy emergency \nand directed the Corps, the Department of the Interior, and other agencies to streamline \nenvironmental reviews for energy development and rescind agency actions that might burden a \nwide range of other energy sources. Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” 90 \nFed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025); Executive Order 14156, “Declaring a National Energy \nEmergency,” 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (Jan. 29, 2025). Citing these directives, the Department of the \nInterior recently announced that it was establishing a process to complete reviews under NEPA \nfor energy-related projects (again excluding wind) in only 28 days and also curtail consultation \nunder the ESA and NHPA.28 NOAA has likewise rescinded certain whale-related requirements \n \n27 Hartnett Decl. ¶¶ 11-27 and Exhibit B, “Adequacy of the Federal Offshore Wind Permitting \nand Environmental Review Processes” (May 8, 2025); Brazell Decl. ¶¶ 13-20 and Exhibit B, \n“Adequacy of Environmental Assessments for Onshore Wind Energy Projects. \n28 https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/department-interior-implements-emergency-permitting-\nprocedures-strengthen-domestic.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 31 of 50\n \n \nfor the oil and gas industry.29 The Administration has encouraged exclusions from detailed \nNEPA review and other streamlining measures for federal coal development,30 and adopted a \nbroad deregulatory initiative to benefit the energy industry.31 The incongruity of the Wind Ban \nwith these other actions cannot be reconciled, especially considering that NOAA has concluded \nthat there is no link between wind energy development and mass whale deaths.32 The \ninexplicable disparate treatment of similarly situated energy technologies is arbitrary, and \nstrongly suggests that the true impetus for the Wind Ban has little to do with genuine concerns \nfor marine mammals or other environmental concerns. Indeed, on information and belief, the \nAdministration has abandoned regional research and monitoring approaches to protect whales. \nAn agency “decision must give a reasoned analysis to justify the disparate treatment of regulated \nparties that seem similarly situated … and its reasoning cannot be internally inconsistent.” ANR \nStorage Co. v. FERC, 904 F.3d 1020, 1024 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  \nThe Wind Ban’s call for a “comprehensive assessment” of wind energy’s impacts on \nconsumer costs and grid reliability before issuing any new wind energy permit is likewise \narbitrary and unsupported by any statutory or regulatory provision. Wind has already been and \ncontinues to be extensively studied through regular permitting and NEPA processes.

Goggin Decl. ¶¶ 9-17. Contrary to the Presidential \nMemorandum’s reference to “intermittent generation of electricity,” wind energy is not an \nintermittent source of energy, and indeed in some cases can contribute more to grid reliability \nthan other energy sources. Goggin Decl. ¶¶ 9, 28-34. The Wind Ban thus contravenes the \nAdministration’s own stated commitment to addressing what it has characterized as a nationwide \n“Energy Emergency” due to an “inadequate energy supply.” See Executive Order 14156. The \nWind Ban also is precisely the type of “agency actions that impose an undue burden on the \nidentification, development, or use of domestic energy resources” that the Administration directs \nagencies to “suspend, revise, or rescind.” See Executive Order 14154 Secs. 3(a), 3(b). \n “When an agency changes course … it must be ‘cognizant that longstanding policies \nmay have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” Dep’t of \nHomeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (quoting \nNavarro, 579 U.S. at 222). Defendants failed to consider the reliance interests of hundreds of \nAmerican companies involved in wind energy development, the Americans who are employed \nby these companies, and the state and local communities that depend on the energy it supplies, as \nwell as on its environmental and economic benefits. Companies make long-term investment \ndecisions under the expectation that they will have the opportunity to seek and secure necessary \nfederal permits. See Wells Decl. ¶¶ 10-19. Because it gravely damages those reasonable \nexpectations, by administrative fiat and without valid justification, the Wind Ban is arbitrary and \ncapricious. See AIDS Vaccine Coalition v. US Department of State, No. 25-00400 (AHA) 2025 \nWL 485324 at *5 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, 2025) (explaining that the Administration had no “rational \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 33 of 50\n \n \nreason for disregarding the massive reliance interests of the countless small and large businesses \nthat would have to shutter programs or shutter their businesses altogether and furlough or lay off \nswaths of Americans in the process”); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management and \nBudget, No. 25-239 (LLA), 2025 WL 597959 at *15 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025); see also Smiley v. \nCitibank, 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996).  \nThe Wind Ban is similarly arbitrary and capricious because it fails to consider its costs \nand benefits in the given circumstances. See Mexican Gulf Fishing Co. v. United States Dep’t of \nCommerce, 60 F.4d 956, 973 (5th Cir. 2023). The costs of the Wind Ban include not only severe \ndisruption of the wind industry and its employees, but also broader effects on the nation’s energy \nsupply in the context of what the Administration itself labels a national energy emergency. In \nadopting the Wind Ban, Defendant Agencies failed to consider these costs, which greatly \noutweigh any benefits of the ban. No agency administrative record shows otherwise. In an \nanalogous challenge to Interior’s stoppage of offshore oil and gas operations in response to the \nDeepwater Horizon incident, the Court held that the plaintiffs would likely show that Interior’s \naction was arbitrary and capricious, explaining that it did not “take into measure the safety \nrecords of those others in the Gulf,” and was not supported by “evidence indicating that the \nSecretary balanced the concern for environmental safety” with development interests. Hornbeck \nOffshore Wind Services v. Salazar, 696 F. Supp. 2d 627, 638 (E.D. La. 2010). \nIn summary, the Wind Ban is not the product of fact-finding or reasoned decision-\nmaking. Instead, the agencies immediately and summarily implemented the Presidential \nMemorandum with no published rationale and without further consideration or evaluation as \nrequired by law. The Presidential Memorandum itself does not supply a reasoned, legally sound \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 34 of 50\n \n \nexplanation for these agencies’ actions, and fails to articulate a rational connection between the \nfacts found and the choices made. The Wind Ban is therefore arbitrary and capricious. \nD.  The Wind Ban Violates APA Notice-and-Comment Requirements. \n  ACE NY is likely to succeed on its claim that the Wind Ban is a substantive rule adopted \n“without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). The APA provides \nthat, before changing policy through a substantive rule, an agency must follow specific \nprocedures, including (1) publishing notice of the proposed rule in the Federal Register, \n(2) providing a period for interested individuals to comment on the proposed rule, and \n(3) publishing the adopted rule not less than thirty days before its effective date. 5 U.S.C. § 553. \nAn agency is only exempt from these procedures when it issues interpretive rules, general \nstatements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, and practice, id. § 553(b)(4)(A), \nor it finds good cause for forgoing these procedures and publishes an explanation of “good \ncause” with the rule, id. §§ 553(b)(4)(B), (d)(3). \n  Here, no agency conducted public notice and comment for the Wind Ban, nor waited 30 \ndays before implementing it. No agency invoked the APA’s “good cause” exception, much less \nsatisfied its narrow conditions that notice and comment would be “impracticable, unnecessary, or \ncontrary to the public interest.” Id. §§ 553(b)(4)(B).  \nNor does the Wind Ban qualify as an interpretive rule or general statement of policy; it is \na “legislative rule” that “creates rights, assigns duties, or imposes obligations, the basic tenor of \nwhich is not already outlined in the law itself.” New Hampshire Hospital Ass’n v. Azar, 887 F.3d \n62, 70 (1st Cir. 2018) (citation omitted). “[A] so-called policy statement that in purpose or likely \neffect narrowly limits administrative discretion … must be taken for what it is—a binding rule of \nsubstantive law.” Clarian Health West, LLC v. Hargan, 878 F.3d 346, 358 (D.C. Cir. 2017) \n(cleaned up). The substantive Wind Ban leaves agency staff with no discretion and significantly \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 35 of 50\n \n \nchanges how the law is applied. See Louisiana v. Biden, No. 2:24-CV-0046, 2024 WL 3253103 \nat *15 (W.D. La. July 1, 2024) (holding that the Department of Energy violated the APA by \nimplementing a liquified natural gas “Export Ban” without notice and comment); Louisiana v. \nBiden, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 295-96. That the Presidential Memorandum “effectively nullif[ies] pre-\nexisting regulations that were themselves codified through notice-and-comment rulemaking only \nbolsters this conclusion.” Pacito, 2025 WL 655075 at *19.  \nE.  The Wind Ban Is Contrary to Law.  \n  Agencies “are creatures of statute” and are therefore subject to the limits prescribed by \nCongress. Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep't of Lab., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). In other words, \nthey “literally have no power to act except to the extent Congress has authorized.” Nat’l Council \nof Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959 at *15. Because no statute grants any agency authority to \nabdicate its permitting responsibilities, the Wind Ban constitutes an agency action “not in \naccordance with law” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), 706(2)(C).33 The APA further requires that “when \napplication is made for a license required by law, the agency … within a reasonable time, shall \nset and complete … proceedings required by law and shall make its decision.” 5 U.S.C. § 558. A \nlicense is defined to include an “agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, … or other \nform of permission,” i.e., the types of actions that the Wind Ban forecloses. 5 U.S.C. § 551(8).  \nThe Wind Ban’s prohibition on permits and authorizations directly conflicts with the \nlanguage of governing statues and regulations, and with the APA’s requirement that agencies \nmake prompt decisions on permits and authorizations. A “new administration may not … ignore \n \n33 Sections 706(2)(A) and (2)(C) contain a “linguistic distinction without a practical difference.” \nVictim Rights Law Center v. Cardona, 552 F. Supp. 3d 104, 127 (D. Mass 2021). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 36 of 50\n \n \nstatutory standards in carrying out its regulatory functions.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 59 n.* \n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).   \n1. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). OCSLA codifies federal jurisdiction \nover the submerged lands seaward of state coastal waters, and governs the exploration, \ndevelopment, and management of natural resources on the outer continental shelf (“OCS”). 43 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 et. seq. OCSLA states that the OCS should be made available for “expeditious \nand orderly development.” 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3); see also Seafreeze Shoreside, Inc, 123 F.4th at \n26. BOEM chiefly exercises the Interior Secretary’s authority over offshore wind. \nOCSLA authorizes the Secretary to issue leases, including for offshore wind \ndevelopment, 43 U.S.C. § 1337(o), but nothing in OCSLA confers authority upon BOEM to \npause issuing authorizations for wind energy on the OCS. Given Congress’s plenary power over \nfederal lands and the OCS, the lack of express statutory authorization to issue anything like the \nWind Ban means that no such authority should be inferred. See, e.g., United States v. Patton, 771 \nF.2d 1240, 1243 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Strict adherence to the wording of the statute is of particular \nimportance in construing a statute regulating public lands, over which Congress has unlimited \nauthority.”). In Louisiana v Biden, the court held that an executive order pausing oil and gas \nlease sales on the OCS was impermissible, as there is “no statutory authority that authorizes the \nExecutive Branch to pause the OCSLA [oil and gas leasing program].” 622 F. Supp. 3d at 289.  \nThe court in Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar similarly found that permitting delays are \ninconsistent with OCSLA. 781 F. Supp. 2d 332, 339 (E.D. La. 2011).   \nConsistently, BOEM’s binding regulations require that, once an OCS lease has been \nissued, BOEM diligently act on subsequent authorizations for development of wind projects to \nproceed. The regulations mandate that BOEM review submissions that relate to development of a \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 37 of 50\n \n \nlease, conduct a review process, and make a decision to approve a request, disapprove it, or \napprove it with conditions. See 30 C.F.R. §§ 585.613 (site assessment plan), 585.628 \n(construction and operations plan), 585.648 (general activities plan for non-commercial leases \nand grants). It is blackletter law that agencies are bound by their regulations, see, e.g., Nat'l Env't \nDev. Assoc.'s Clean Air Project v. E.P.A., 752 F.3d 999, 1009 (D.C. Cir. 2014), yet BOEM has \nnot even attempted to square its actions with these provisions.   \nFinally, Congress has prescribed a statutory procedure by which the President can \nwithdraw areas of the OCS from leasing, thus preventing development there. 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1341(a). However, that mechanism is applicable by its terms only to “unleased” portions of the \nOCS. Id. To the extent that the Wind Ban prevents development on existing leases, it amounts to \nan unlawful withdrawal of leased lands on the OCS. See Patton, 771 F.2d at 1243; see also 43 \nU.S.C. § 1341(c), (d) (authorizing lease suspensions only on grounds of “war or national \nemergency” or “national defense”).   \n2. The Federal Land and Policy Management Act (FLPMA). FLPMA governs \nmanagement of public lands administered by BLM. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq. FLPMA requires \nBLM to manage lands in accordance with its own land use plans. 43 U.S.C. § 1732(a). Land use \ndecisions, including exclusions of uses such as ROWs, remain subject to reconsideration only \nthrough revision of the land use plan involved. 43 U.S.C. § 1712(e). “Unless and until the plan is \namended, [inconsistent actions] can be set aside as contrary to law pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2).” Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 69 (2004). FLPMA provides a formal \nprocess for revision of land use plans that includes public involvement. 43 U.S.C. § 1712.  \nIn adopting the Wind Ban, the Department of the Interior and BLM failed to follow these \nmandatory processes. The Wind Ban is inconsistent with dozens of governing BLM land use \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 38 of 50\n \n \nplans across the United States. In 2005 BLM issued a Record of Decision (“ROD”) adopting a \ncomprehensive Wind Energy Development Program to develop wind energy resources on BLM \nlands. BLM, Implementation of a Wind Energy Development Program and Associated Land Use \nPlan Amendments, BLM Record of Decisions (December 2005). The ROD amended 52 BLM \nland use plans to provide for development of wind energy, and identified certain areas in which \nwind energy development would be excluded. Id. When an agency action significantly changes \n“the scope of resource uses” or the “terms, conditions and decisions” of the land use plan, BLM \nmust first amend the land use plans and utilize the same planning process. Klamath Siskiyou \nWildlands Ctr. v. Boody, 468 F.3d 549, 556 (9th Cir. 2006). BLM’s cessation of issuance of \npermits for wind projects significantly changed this program and land use plans without \nfollowing the amendment process, violating FLPMA.  \nIn addition to amending land use plans, BLM has adopted regulations providing that, in \nprocessing a solar or wind ROW application, BLM will “prioritize the application in accordance \nwith 43 C.F.R § 2804.35,” and “will evaluate” the application based on the information provided \nby the applicant and input from other parties and the public. 43 C.F.R. § 2804.25. Ending \nissuance of all wind energy ROWs is inconsistent with these regulatory provisions as well. \n  The Wind Ban also violates FLPMA because it unlawfully operates to withdraw land \nfrom wind energy development. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1714, 1702(j) (definition of withdrawal). \nWithdrawal “temporarily suspends the operation of some or all of the public lands laws, \npreserving the status quo while Congress or the executive decides on the ultimate disposition of \nthe subject lands.” S. Utah Wilderness All. v. BLM, 425 F.3d 735, 784 (10th Cir. 2005). Congress \nenacted FLPMA in part to “delineate the extent to which the Executive may withdraw lands \nwithout legislative action.” 43 U.S.C. § 1701(a)(4). Although FLPMA authorizes certain \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 39 of 50\n \n \nwithdrawals, such authority is expressly limited. 43 U.S.C. § 1714(a) (“[T]he Secretary is \nauthorized to make, modify, extend, or revoke withdrawals but only in accordance with the \nprovisions and limitations of this section.”). And withdrawal is subject to requirements that range \nfrom Federal Register publication and public hearing, id. § 1714(b), (h), to Congressional \nnotification in some circumstances, id. § 1714(c), (e). The executive’s failure to act on mineral \nlease applications due to a “suspension and delay of mineral leasing pending an environmental \nreview” has been found invalid as an unauthorized withdrawal. Mountain States Legal Found. v. \nHodel, 668 F. Supp. 1466, 1474 (D. Wyo. 1987). The Wind Ban similarly removes BLM lands \nfrom wind energy development pending a “comprehensive assessment and review,” effectuating \nan unlawful withdrawal under FLPMA.  \n  Finally, the Wind Ban operates to suspend existing ROW grants by barring BLM from \nproviding authorizations needed to develop the ROWs. FLPMA provides only two permissible \ngrounds for suspension of a ROW: abandonment and FLPMA noncompliance. 43 U.S.C. § 1766. \nThe statute also requires that holder of the ROW must be afforded “due notice” and appropriate \nadministrative proceeding prior to suspension. Id. The Wind Ban does not meet the substantive \npreconditions for suspension, and BLM has not followed the procedure required by law.   \n  3. Clean Water Act (“CWA”) Section 404. Section 404 of the CWA regulates the \ndischarge of dredge or fill materials into waters of the United States. 33 U.S.C. § 1344. The \nCorps is responsible for issuing Section 404 permits for such activities.  \nThe Corps has reviewable discretion whether to grant a permit, but not to wholly \ndisregard such requests. The CWA provides the Secretary “shall” enter into agreements with \nother agencies in order to “minimize … delays in the issuance of permits” and to “assure that, to \nthe maximum extent practicable” a decision will be reached on a permit application “not later \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 40 of 50\n \n \nthan the ninetieth day after the date the notice for such application is published.” 33 U.S.C. \n§ 1344(q). The Corps’ regulations applying to individual permits provide that the Corps “shall” \nnotify the applicant of an incomplete application within 15 calendar days; that public notice \n“will” be issued within 15 calendar days of receipt of complete application; and that “[d]istrict \nengineers will decide on all applications not later than 60 [calendar] days after receipt of a \ncomplete application” (with six listed exceptions). 33 C.F.R. § 325.2. In systematically refusing \nto issue decisions on permits related to wind development, the Corps has acted contrary to these \nmandatory provisions. \n  4.  Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA).  \nThe Wind Ban conflicts with the requirements of the ESA and BGEPA. The ESA establishes \nprotections for fish, wildlife, and plants that are listed as endangered or threatened. 16 U.S.C. \n§§ 1531 et. seq. Section 10 of the ESA authorizes USFWS or NMFS to issue permits for the \nincidental “take” of threatened and endangered species. 16 U.S.C. § 1539. Those agencies \n“shall” issue an incidental take permit if it determines that specified requirements are met. 16 \nU.S.C. § 1539(a)(2)(B). This use of “shall” contrasts with the use of “may” in 16 U.S.C. \n§ 1539(a)(1), a related provision, and demonstrates that Congress intended the former to be \nmandatory. Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States, 579 U.S. 162, 172 (2016). \n  USFWS’s ESA implementing regulations similarly use mandatory language, stating in \none provision that “upon receipt of a properly executed application for a permit, the Director \nshall issue the appropriate permit” unless specified concerns are present. 50 C.F.R. § 13.21. \nOther regulations provide that “[t]he Service will process the application when the Director \ndetermines the application is complete,” that “the Director will decide whether a permit should \nbe issued,” and that the Director “will” issue the permit if he makes certain findings. 50 C.F.R. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 41 of 50\n \n \n§ 17.22(b). NMFS’s comparable regulations provide that NMFS will attempt to approve \napplications “in the shortest possible time,” 50 C.F.R. § 222.302(b), and that the agency “shall” \nissue a permit unless certain enumerated findings are made. 50 C.F.R. § 222.303(e). The \nagencies have no authority to adopt a contrary policy. Yet, the Wind Ban proscribes any permits \nindefinitely. \nPer its BGEPA regulations, USFWS “will automatically” issue a general permit for \nidentified activities meeting eligibility requirements if certain criteria are met. 50 C.F.R. \n§ 22.210(d). Wind energy is specifically listed as a permissible permit category. 50 C.F.R. \n§ 22.250. The Wind Ban illegally upends this binding framework. \n  5.  Marine Mammal Protection Act. The MMPA establishes protections for marine \nmammals and includes a general prohibition on the taking and importing of marine mammals, \nsubject to a number of exemptions. 16 U.S.C. § 1371. The MMPA provides that the NMFS or \nUSFWS “shall allow … the incidental, but not intentional, taking … of marine mammals” if it \nfinds, inter alia, that the effect of the take will be “negligible.” 16 U.S.C. § 1371(a)(5)(A)(i)  \n(emphasis added). Notably, in contrast to the mandatory “shall” in this provision, elsewhere the \nMMPA provides only that NMFS or USFWS “may” issue a permit, 16 U.S.C. § 1371(a)(1)(2), \ndemonstrating that the use of “shall” is mandatory. Kingdomware, 579 U.S. at 172. NMFS and \nUSFWS implementing regulations each provide that the agency “shall evaluate” each permit \nrequest. 50 C.F.R. § 216.104(c) (NMFS); 50 C.F.R. § 18.27(d)(3) (USFWS). The Wind Ban \ndisplays no awareness of the existing MMPA framework and instead summarily replaces it. \n  6.  Clean Air Act. The CAA defines the EPA’s responsibilities for protecting and \nimproving the nation’s air quality, including controlling air pollution from OCS sources. 42 \nU.S.C. § 7627. Accordingly, OCS wind developers must typically obtain a “Prevention of \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 42 of 50\n \n \nSignificant Deterioration” (“PSD”) permit from EPA prior to commencing construction offshore. \nThe CAA provides that applications for PSD permits “shall be granted or denied not later than \none year after the date of filing of such completed application.” 42 U.S.C. § 7475(c). EPA’s PSD \nregulations provide that EPA “shall” review submitted applications for completeness within 30 \ndays of receipt. 40 C.F.R. § 124.3. All draft permits “shall” be publicly noticed and made \navailable for public comment, id., and EPA “shall” issue a final permit decision after the close of \npublic comment. Id. § 124.15.34 The Wind Ban precludes EPA from meeting these obligations as \napplicable to wind projects.  \n7.  Clean Water Act Section 402. Pursuant to the CWA, the EPA Administrator may issue \na National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit for the discharge of any \npollutant or combination of pollutants if the requested discharge meets the requirements provided \nin the statute. 33 U.S.C. § 1342. NPDES permits can be required for some types of wind energy \nfacilities that will have such discharge. The Administrator is required to review NPDES permit \napplications for completeness within 30 days of receipt, 40 C.F.R. § 124.3(c), and provide the \napplicant with a timeline for preparing a draft permit, conducting public comment, and issuing a \nfinal permit. Id. § 124.3(g). The Wind Ban prevents compliance with these provisions.   \n  These statutory and regulatory provisions, among others, demonstrate that agencies are \nrequired to carry out their permitting responsibilities and to do so in a timely manner, and have \nno authority to adopt a uniform policy of taking no action on pending applications, or to adopt a \n \n34 Some OCS permits are issued instead under the CAA’s New Source Review provisions. \nApplicable EPA regulations provide that, unless the Administrator determines an application is \nincomplete within 60 days of receipt, the application will be deemed complete. 40 C.F.R. \n§ 71.5(a)(2). EPA “shall” take final action on each permit application (including a request for \npermit modification or renewal) within 18 months after receiving a complete application. 40 \nC.F.R. § 71.7; see also 42 U.S.C. § 7661b(c) (18-month deadline). \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 43 of 50\n \n \ngeneral policy of differentiating between applicants and giving highly adverse treatment to one \ncategory of applicants. Indeed, Congress has directed the opposite, providing in the FAST-41 \nlegislation that agencies must adopt and follow a timetable in issuing permits for covered \ninfrastructure projects, including many wind energy projects, to ensure that those projects \nproceed expeditiously. 42 U.S.C. § 4370m-2; see also ACE NY Complaint ¶¶ 149-156.35 \nMoreover, no constitutional or statutory provision authorizes the executive branch to issue a \nunilateral ban on wind energy, and Congress has specifically denied that authority by adopting \nstatutes prescribing permitting obligations. The U.S. Constitution does not authorize the \nexecutive branch to “enact, amend, or repeal statutes.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. \n417, 438 (1998). Defendant agencies have contravened the law by open-endedly terminating \ntheir respective permitting programs for wind projects alone. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), 706(2)(C). \nF.  The Wind Ban Violates OCSLA. \n  OCSLA provides a remedy to compel compliance with its provisions. 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1349(a)(1). As set forth supra, the Wind Ban violates OCSLA and its implementing \nregulations, and these violations immediately affect ACE NY’s legal interests. Id. § 1349(a)(3). \nIt follows that ACE NY is likely to succeed on the merits of this claim as well as its APA claims.   \nII.  ACE NY’S MEMBERS ARE SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM. \n  ACE NY’s members face irreparable harm from the Wind Ban. For a preliminary \ninjunction, “the irreparability of the injury is of paramount concern.” K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental \nPlaza, Inc., 875 F. Supp. 2d 907, 914 (1st Cir. 1989); Restaurant Law Ctr. v. United States Dep't \n \n35 Congress also specifically restricted extensions of the permitting timetable when such \nextensions occur for reasons within the control of the federal government (as is the case here), \nfurther demonstrating that the Wind Ban is at odds with Congress’s intent in enacting FAST-41. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 4370m–2 (c)(2)(D)(iii) (limiting the time period of extensions unless those \nextensions occur for reasons outside the control of the government agencies involved, and \nproviding for a report to Congress following certain such extensions). \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 44 of 50\n \n \nof Labor, 66 F.4th 593, 597 (5th Cir. 2023) (the “key inquiry is ‘not so much the magnitude but \nthe irreparability’”). Costs incurred by a plaintiff to adhere to a government policy “later held \ninvalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs,” \nbecause for example the United States is typically immune to monetary damages. See Thunder \nBasin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment). Unrecoverable lost business income, up to and including business \nclosure, can also be irreparable harm. Alabama Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health and Human \nServices, 594 U.S. 758, 765 (2021).  \nUntil the Wind Ban is lifted, ACE NY’s members will suffer irreparable harm in the form \nof delay costs and lost revenue totaling in the billions of dollars, existential business risks, and \nother unrecoverable expenditures. The Wind Ban has brought ongoing development of wind \nenergy to a halt, both on federal public lands and on private land.   \nThe domestic wind industry has been severely affected by the delay in permitting \nassociated with the Wind Ban and the uncertainty as to if and when construction of wind projects \ncan resume. Facilities to produce wind turbines and equipment have closed and employees have \nlost their jobs. Investment in development of new wind installations has come to a halt. Wells \nDecl. ¶¶ 11-16, 21-22. A report by Wood Mackenzie concludes that if the Wind Ban continues \ninto the second half of 2026, the result will be 33,000 lost jobs in the industry and $43 billion in \nlost investment, which rises to 96,000 jobs and $96 billion in lost investment if the Wind Ban \ncontinues through 2029. Declaration of Kara McNutt, Wood McKenzie, Exhibit B, \nUnderstanding the Impact of the Presidential Memorandum on the US Wind Industry at 8 (May \n2025). \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 45 of 50\n \n \nExisting projects that require federal permits and authorizations have postponed or \nsuspended construction timelines. Because wind facilities are capital-intensive and installation of \nwind turbines requires specialized equipment that is typically owned by third parties, delays in \nconstruction have direct costs to developers under existing development and construction \ncontracts. In light of the uncertainty as to when federal permitting will resume, developers cannot \nset new construction timelines or enter into new construction contracts. Wind development is \ngenerally financed by third parties, and delays in installation have direct costs to developers, \ninvestors, or lenders that have contractual financing arrangements in place, but now cannot \nreliably forecast when wind projects will be completed and begin to generate revenue.   \nThe irreparable harms to the industry are described in detail in multiple declarations \nsupporting this motion. As to offshore wind projects, ACE NY members have invested $4.37 \nbillion in leases just in BOEM’s 2022 auction of leases in the New York Bight, and continue to \nmake lease payments even though BOEM is not taking any action to advance their wind energy \nprojects. Wells Decl. ¶¶ 21-22. One ACE NY member has had its wind energy project, which \nhad received all required federally permits, delayed by the Wind Ban and has had to reduce \npersonnel, terminate contracts, and cancel planned investments in the project, leading to \ncontinuing financial harm. Id. ¶¶ 29-33. Another ACE NY member has experienced hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in losses and estimates that the Wind Ban could cause a billion dollars in \neconomic losses to its businesses. Id. ¶ 44. Three ACE NY members have invested tens of \nmillions of dollars in pending land-based wind projects and are incurring daily losses. Id. ¶ 50.  \nThe manufacturing supply chain and construction sector serving the wind industry are \nlikewise seriously affected by the Wind Ban. ACE NY’s members in those sectors are \nexperiencing significant financial losses. Id. ¶¶ 52, 54. For example, Atlantic Wind Transfers, a \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 46 of 50\n \n \nbusiness that operates vessels that transfer crews and materials to wind energy facilities during \nconstruction or while they are in operation, is now experiencing “projected revenue losses of \nmillions of dollars.” Donadio Decl. ¶ 7.  These losses are “immediate” and they “cannot be \nrecovered.” Id. ¶ 9.   \n Two manufacturers of offshore wind components, Technostrobe and Roman Stone, have \nbeen forced to terminate staff and have experienced severe revenue losses. Burdock Decl. ¶¶ 33, \n45. Companies collecting and analyzing geophysical, environmental, and acoustic data for \noffshore wind projects have lost millions of dollars and conducted extensive layoffs of staff.  Id. \n¶¶ 34, 35, 36, 38. Vessel operators and vessel designers specializing in offshore wind projects \nhave experienced substantial losses and project hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue.  \nId. ¶¶ 37, 39, 42. Other harms to the sector include losses to an offshore engineering business, id. \n¶ 44, severe harms to a labor union whose members work on construction and installation of \noffshore wind facilities, id. ¶ 49, and severe harms to other related businesses, id. ¶¶ 27, 32, 40, \n43, 46.   \nThe Wind Ban creates substantial risks of project cancellation—indeed, that appears to be \nits very intent—resulting in a total inability to realize the benefits of project investments, as well \nas environmental benefits. And wind energy service companies, including those that manufacture \nturbine components and other components in the United States, face potential total loss of their \nbusinesses due to cancelled orders and demand for specialized materials, equipment, and labor. \nWells Decl. ¶¶ 15, 20, 47, 49; Burdock Decl. ¶¶ 25, 33, 45. The Wind Ban has had similar effects \non port investments, transmission grid upgrades, and similar essential infrastructure projects. \nWells Decl. ¶ 28; Burdock Decl. ¶¶ 23-24. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 47 of 50\n \n \nACE NY’s members will generally not be able to recover the majority of these economic \nlosses under existing law. Multiple statutes underlying ACE NY’s claims include no waiver of \nsovereign immunity for revenues lost due to permitting delays, no matter how unreasonable \nthose delays may be. 33 U.S.C. §§ 1341-1346; 33 U.S.C. §§ 401-408; 16 U.S.C. § 1539; 16 \nU.S.C. §§ 668-668d; 16 U.S.C. § 1374; 42 U.S.C. §§ 7661-7661f. OCSLA provides a limited \nremedy that is only available if a lease is expressly cancelled or suspended, which has not \noccurred here, rather than rendered indefinitely useless while lease periods continue to run. 30 \nC.F.R. § 550.184 (2024); cf. Louisiana v. Biden, 543 F. Supp. 3d 388 (W.D. La. 2021), \nremanded on other grounds, 45 F.4th 841 (5th Cir. 2022) (oil and gas leasing pause created \neconomic losses in the form of “loss of proceeds” that would be “would be difficult, if not \nimpossible to recover, due to sovereign immunity”). FLPMA likewise contains no provision for \nrecovery of lost profits or revenues when the federal government declines to issue authorizations \nneeded to develop a ROW. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq. Given this reality, ACE NY members \nseeking to develop wind projects likely will be unable to recover economic losses incurred and \nthus will suffer irreparable harm due to the Wind Ban.  \nIn short, the Wind Ban has effectuated unprecedented uncertainty for the wind energy \nindustry, and in so doing has threatened billions of dollars in investment in wind energy projects \nacross the nation, as well as harmed many businesses severely and destroyed thousands of jobs. \nFor these reasons, ACE NY’s members will continue to suffer significant irreparable harm if the \nCourt does not enjoin the Defendant agencies’ implementation of the Wind Ban pending a \ndecision on the merits of ACE NY’s claims.  \nIII.  THE BALANCE OF THE EQUITIES AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST FAVOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 48 of 50\n \n \nThe final factors, balance of equities and the public interest, also weigh in favor of \npreliminarily enjoining the Wind Ban. Given that the government is the opposing party, these \nfactors merge. Nken v Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009); TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 490 F. Supp. 3d \n73 (D.D.C. 2020) (explaining that “the government’s interest is the public interest”) (emphasis in \noriginal).  \nThe government and the public are not harmed by the issuance of an injunction that \nprevents agencies from enforcing unlawful actions. See Doe v. Trump, No. 25-10135-LTS, 2025 \nWL 485070 (D. Mass. Feb. 13, 2025); League of Women Voters of the United States v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (there is “no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful \nagency action”). Moreover, the government is not harmed by “a continuation of the status quo \nduring the pendency of … litigation [which] only shortly prolong[s] the longstanding practice \nand policy of the United States government.” See New Hampshire Indonesian Cmty. Support v. \nTrump, No. 25-CV-38-JL-TSM, 2025 WL 457609, at *5 (D.N.H. Feb. 11, 2025). Here, an \ninjunction “supports the public interest in having agencies abide by federal law.” Mass. v. NIH,  \nNo. 25-CV-10338, 2025 WL 702163 (D. Mass. March 5, 2025). \nThere is also a strong public interest in ensuring that the public can rely on the rule of law \nand a predictable permitting process. This interest extends beyond the wind industry to other \nindustries and the public at large. Regulated parties cannot compete in the marketplace and make \ninvestment decisions if there is complete uncertainty as to whether they will be able to secure \npermits necessary for project development. Invenergy Renewables, Inc. v. United States, 422 F. \nSupp. 3d 1255 (Ct. Intl. Trade 2019) (describing the harms caused by “eliminating the business \ncertainty required by the solar industry to plan and develop future projects.”). The government’s \nunlawful actions here have frozen projects in place, undercut the predictability of federal \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 49 of 50\n \n \npermitting processes, and threaten to deter future investment in wind and in other capital-\nintensive technologies.   \nThe public has a strong interest in a reliable, affordable, lower emission energy supply. \nThe Wind Ban has impeded the deployment of affordable, emission-free wind power amidst an \nenergy emergency caused by surging load growth and the mass retirement of legacy generation \nsources. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) has estimated that over \n79 gigawatts (“GW”) of generation capacity will retire within the next decade, whereas load \ngrowth from AI data centers and semiconductor chip manufacturing facilities could increase \ndemand by as much as 128 GW of capacity by 2029.36 Future electricity supply constraints not \nonly threaten to dramatically increase electricity prices for ratepayers—as the Trump \nadministration has acknowledged through the declaration of an energy emergency—but “leaves \nus vulnerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United \nStates’ national security.” Executive Order 14156. Wind energy will be urgently needed to meet \nthis surge in demand for electricity.37 Despite this reality, the Wind Ban threatens to stunt the \ndeployment of wind energy at the precise moment when it is most urgently required.  \nFinally, the Wind Ban impairs the public’s ability to realize the benefits of wind energy. \n“Congress has articulated the public policy that our nation should incorporate clean energy as a \npart of America’s future and it is essential … [for] decreasing greenhouse emissions.” See W. \nWatersheds Project v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 774 F. Supp. 2d 1089, 1103 (D. Nev. 2011), aff’d, \n443 F. App’x 278 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing the Energy Policy Act of 2005). Because wind energy \n \n36 NERC, 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment (2024); John D. Wilson, Zach Zimmerman, \nand Rob Gramlich, Strategic Industries Surging: Driving US Power Demand, Grid Strategies \n(2024). \n37 McNutt Decl., Exhibit B, Understanding the Impact of the Presidential Memorandum on the \nWind Industry at 11-13. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-FDS     Document 55-1     Filed 05/12/25     Page 50 of 50\n \n \nwill play an essential role in decarbonizing the electric grid, ensuring cleaner air for healthier \ncitizens, and mitigating the impact of climate change, the Wind Ban seriously impedes the \npublic’s interest in achieving those goals. \nGiven that the Wind Ban is not in the government’s or public’s interest, while \nimmediately harming ACE NY’s members, the balance of equities tips in ACE NY’s favor. All \nparties and the public will be served if the Court enjoins implementation of the Wind Ban and \norders agencies to resume their vital work of diligently carrying out their statutory, regulatory, \nand contractual obligations under their respective permitting programs. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, ACE NY respectfully requests that this Court grant a \npreliminary injunction of the Wind Ban while this case proceeds on the merits.  \nDated: May 12, 2025         Respectfully submitted, \n \nBEVERIDGE & DIAMOND, P.C. \n     /s/ Brook J.

This case concerns a sudden and indefinite prohibition of any new or renewed \nfederal agency approvals needed for offshore and onshore wind energy projects nationwide. \nFollowing a Presidential directive (“Presidential Memorandum”), multiple federal agencies have \nabruptly ceased issuing approvals needed for offshore and onshore wind projects, causing \nextensive disruption to businesses and workers in the wind industry and delaying vitally needed \nexpansion of our nation’s energy supply. The Presidential Memorandum’s directed stoppage of \nfederal approvals for wind projects and federal agencies’ adoption and implementation of that \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 3 of 63\n \ndirective are collectively referred to herein as the “Wind Ban.” The Wind Ban is arbitrary and \ncapricious, unsupported by any factual record, ultra vires, procedurally deficient, \nunconstitutional, and otherwise unlawful. \n2.  On January 20, 2025, the first day of the current Administration, a Presidential \nMemorandum unlawfully directed the heads of federal agencies to indefinitely abdicate their \ncongressionally imposed obligations to issue decisions with respect to “approvals, rights of way, \npermits, leases, or loans” needed for wind energy development in the United States. Temporary \nWithdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review \nof the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects¸ Section 2(a), \n90 Fed. Reg. 8363 (Jan. 20, 2025). A copy of the Presidential Memorandum is attached as \nExhibit A hereto. \n3.  The Presidential Memorandum’s directive is massive in scope and defies \nnumerous longstanding statutory and regulatory schemes by commanding federal agencies to \nhalt, without reason, all authorizations necessary to facilitate the development of wind projects \nnationwide. This targeted attack on one of America’s fastest growing, least expensive, and most \nenvironmentally friendly forms of energy production severely harms a critical domestic industry \nand the millions of people who would be served by the extensive electrical power it generates. \nThe Wind Ban brings an immediate halt to hundreds of critical wind energy projects on offshore \nwaters and public and private lands, jeopardizing billions of dollars in investment and hundreds \nof thousands of U.S. jobs. Wind energy provides 10.1 percent of the nation’s electricity, is highly \ncost-effective, and is the cheapest source of new electricity in many parts of the country. Wind \nenergy is also a key U.S. industry, with nearly $330 billion of private investment over the past 20 \nyears, and creation of an extensive domestic supply chain for wind turbines and their \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 4 of 63\n \ncomponents. The industry supports over 300,000 American jobs and delivers more than $2 \nbillion in state and local tax payments and lease payments annually.    \n4.  Issuance, adoption, and implementation of the far-reaching Wind Ban directly \ncontravenes the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and multiple other congressional and \nregulatory mandates providing for orderly decisions on proposed wind energy projects and, in \nturn, is ultra vires. No statute or constitutional provision grants the Administration authority to \norder a blanket stop of wind energy development. In fact, the opposite is true. By mandating that \nagencies disregard statutory and regulatory requirements, the Wind Ban usurps Congress’s \nauthority.  \n5.  The Wind Ban additionally circumvents legally required public process. In \ncontravention of well-developed regulatory regimes duly promulgated through notice-and-\ncomment rulemakings, the Wind Ban directs federal agencies to withhold all new wind approvals \nimmediately and indefinitely, without notice or opportunity for public comment required by law. \nIn carrying out their constitutionally protected police powers, state and local governments are \nrelying on wind energy development to meet their growing electricity needs and to address the \nongoing climate crisis. Before taking far-reaching actions of national consequence, which could \naffect grid reliability and energy costs for ratepayers, federal agencies should have followed laws \nrequiring them to seek the views of stakeholders who might be affected. But here, legally \nrequired decision-making processes were not followed, and, in the absence of a publicly \navailable administrative record accompanying these major agency actions, it does not appear that \nreasoned decision-making has occurred.  \n6.  The Presidential Memorandum’s purported concerns regarding the environmental \nimpacts of wind energy have no basis in fact. Instead, they appear to be an arbitrary and \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 5 of 63\n \npolitically driven pretext for “end[ing]” the wind industry and ensuring that there will not be \n“even one [wind turbine] built” during this Administration.1 In light of such pledges, there is no \ncause to believe that the Wind Ban is short-term in nature.  \n7.  The purported “comprehensive assessment and review” commissioned by the \nPresidential Memorandum may not even exist, as there are no reported updates during nearly \nfour months. In any event, the Wind Ban does not establish any timeframe and will operate, in \npractice, as an indefinite moratorium on wind energy development. The stated reasons for the \nWind Ban ignore extensive research and scientific analyses demonstrating that wind energy is a \nsafe, environmentally sound, and cost-effective technology. These analyses include multiple, \nyears-long, robust permitting processes by several federal, state, and local agencies necessary to \nauthorize leasing, construction, and operations of wind energy projects. Scientific evidence \noverwhelmingly supports the conclusion that wind energy is safe and reliable. The Presidential \nMemorandum’s mandate for a new, generalized, and undefined study on the environmental and \neconomic impacts of wind energy before approving any offshore or onshore wind project is \nentirely inconsistent with these findings.   \n8.  Tellingly, while the Presidential Memorandum claims that the Wind Ban is needed \nto allow federal agencies an indefinite amount of time to reevaluate “various environmental \nreviews required by the National Environmental Policy Act to lease or permit wind projects” to \nsearch for “potential inadequacies” in them, it inexplicably excludes all other energy sources \n(e.g., oil and gas) from such a review. As outlined in detail in subsequent paragraphs, wind \nenergy projects undergo extensive environmental reviews—but the Presidential Memorandum \n \n1 Martinez, A., et al., “Trump wants to ‘Drill, baby, drill.’ What does that mean for climate concerns?” \nhttps://www.npr.org/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5181963/trump-promises-more-drilling-in-the-u-s-to-boost-fossil-fuel-\nproduction.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 6 of 63\n \nmakes no mention of those reviews. This is the case even though these other sources have, at a \nminimum, equal potential to cause environmental harm and are subject to the same \nenvironmental review processes. The Administration’s inexplicably disparate treatment of \nsimilarly situated energy technologies is wholly arbitrary and unjustified.  \n9.  Further demonstrating its irrationality, the Wind Ban directly contravenes the \nAdministration’s own stated commitment to addressing what it has characterized as a nationwide \n“Energy Emergency” due to an “inadequate energy supply.” Executive Order 14156, Declaring a \nNational Energy Emergency, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (Jan. 20, 2025)—issued on the very same day as \nthe Presidential Memorandum precipitating the Wind Ban—states that the United States needs a \n“reliable, diversified and affordable supply of energy.” The country will require nearly 1,000 \nTWh of new electricity by 2035 to meet growing demand from data centers, manufacturing, \nindustrial demand, and electrification. Wind is already America’s largest source of renewable \nenergy, providing 10.1 percent of the nation’s electricity. Indeed, including both offshore and \nonshore wind, the overall wind pipeline in 2024 totaled 40 GW, with 20 GW under construction. \nAs a conservative estimate,2 this would be enough to power 4 million homes. Thus, wind energy \nplays a significant role in meeting this growing energy demand. If federal agencies stop \npermitting wind energy projects altogether, that will create an energy shortage that will diminish \ngrid security nationwide and impede economic growth, frustrating the Administration’s own \ndeclared objective of establishing a “reliable, diversified and affordable” energy supply.  \n10.  The failure of the Administration to consider reliance interests in freezing wind \ndevelopment further demonstrates the lack of any legal foundation for the Wind Ban. Acting in \n \n2 https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/expert-speaks-on-how-many-homes-can-be-powered-by-1-mw-when-peak-\ndemand-sits-at-85000-mw (noting varying methodologies for estimating homes powered per megawatt, which range \nfrom 200 to 670 homes).   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 7 of 63\n \nreliance on legislative promises enacted by Congress, federal regulatory requirements, and \ncontractual agreements executed by government agencies responsible for wind energy \ndevelopment on public lands, the wind energy industry has invested hundreds of billions of \ndollars developing many gigawatts of electricity production to meet our nation’s energy needs- \nwhile creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. Prompt permitting decisions are \ncritical to realizing the fruits of these investments, particularly given the finite duration of leases \nand rights of way and long lead times for procuring necessary equipment, labor, and services for \nconstruction, and inflationary pressures over time.  \n11.  Accordingly, the Wind Ban and all federal actions in furtherance thereof must be \nvacated and enjoined, and federal agencies should be ordered to carry out their congressionally \nand regulatorily prescribed requirements to facilitate the development of wind energy without \nregard to the Presidential Memorandum or the timing of its purported study. \nPARTIES \n12.

See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n31.  Wind is America’s largest source of renewable energy, and one of its largest \nsources of total energy. The wind industry as a whole directly and indirectly supports more than \n300,000 U.S. jobs, including 20,000 wind manufacturing jobs at over 450 domestic facilities. In \n2023 alone, the wind industry invested $10 billion in new projects in the U.S.  \n32.  As the United States Department of Energy has acknowledged, wind energy is a \nproven, widely supported, abundant, and inexhaustible clean energy resource.3  \n33.  “Electricity generated by wind turbines does not pollute the water we drink or the \nair we breathe, so wind energy means less smog, less acid rain, and fewer greenhouse gas \nemissions.”4  \n34.  Using one representative year, “[t]he health and climate benefits of wind were \nimpressive in 2023—with climate and health benefits together contributing on average \n \n3 See United States Department of Energy, Advantages and Challenges of Wind Power, \nhttp://energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy; also see United States Department of Energy, \nWind Energy Benefits (2015), https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/62823.pdf.  \n4 Id. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 11 of 63\n \n$162/MWh. When combined with the $21/MWh grid-system value of wind energy—that is, the \nvalue of the services wind energy provided to the grid, calculated based on market prices where \nand when wind energy was generated—the total value of wind energy is $183/MWh.”5 \n35.  Wind energy “delivers an estimated $2 billion in state and local tax payments and \nland lease payments each year,” creates a diverse and secure power grid, and provides one of the \nlowest-priced energy sources available today.6  \n36.  Since 1978 federal law has supported tax credits for renewable energy \ndevelopment, including wind development to encourage the commercialization of a broad range \nof energy technologies and resources. See Energy Tax Act of 1978 (Pub. L. No. 95-618). In \naddition, for over two decades federal law has declared it the policy of the United States to \nsupport renewable energy (including wind) research, development, demonstration, and \ndeployment. See Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-58); the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007 (Pub. L. No. 110-140); the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, \nenacted as Division B of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Pub. L. No. 110-\n343); the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. No. 111-5); the Energy Act \nof 2020, enacted as Division Z of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (Pub. L. No. 116-\n260); the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. No. 117-58), also known as the \nBipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL); and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Pub. L. No. 117-\n169). This policy of supporting renewable energy development is also reflected in substantive \nstatutory changes. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 added 43 U.S.C. 1337(p), which authorized \nwind leasing of the Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”), and the IRA amended the definition of the \n \n5 Id. \n6 United States Department of Energy, Advantages and Challenges of Wind Power, \nhttp://energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 12 of 63\n \nOCS specifically to allow for additional leasing for offshore wind projects. Inflation Reduction \nAct,  Pub. L. No. 117-169, § 50251(b)(1)-(2), 136 Stat. 1818, 2054-55 (2022). \n37.  Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have renewable portfolio \nstandards and goals requiring increased production of energy from renewable energy sources. \nMany of these states rely on wind energy projects to meet these mandated renewable energy \ntargets, and to meet growing energy demands. \nI.  Extensive Review of Wind Projects on Federal Lands. \n38.  To date, BOEM has approved eight commercial-scale offshore wind projects.  \n39.  Each project underwent multiple levels of environmental review. First, at the \nleasing stage, BOEM prepared “Environmental Assessments” (“EAs”) that assess the potential \nimpact of and reasonable alternatives to commercial wind lease issuance, site characterization \nactivities (geophysical, geotechnical, archaeological, and biological surveys) and site assessment \nactivities (including the installation and operation of a meteorological tower or buoys). These \nsurveys form the basis of proposed “construction and operations plans” (“COPs”) submitted to \nBOEM for review. Then before approving a project and its COP, BOEM conducts site-specific \nreview that includes the preparation of a draft and final “Environmental Impact Statement” \n(“EIS”) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) with the assistance of \nother cooperating agencies with consulting or permitting roles, including NMFS, the Corps, the \nDepartment of Defense (“DOD”), the United States Coast Guard, the Bureau of Safety and \nEnvironmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), EPA, and cooperating states, localities, and tribes.  \n40.  These multi-year reviews are extensive and analyze a wide range of potential \nimpacts, including the effects on air quality, bats, benthic resources, birds, coastal habitat and \nfauna, finfish and essential fish habitat, marine mammals, sea turtles, scenic and visual resources, \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 13 of 63\n \nwater quality, wetlands, and cultural resources. BOEM also consults extensively with DOD to \nensure the project will not adversely affect national security.  \n41.  After taking a hard look at the impacts associated with offshore wind \ndevelopment, BOEM, in consultation with other relevant agencies, has, for example, determined \nthat projects “could be conducted safely, would contain appropriate mitigation to avoid and \nminimize environmental impacts, and would not unreasonably interfere with other uses of the \narea.”7 Regarding whales, BOEM after extensive studies both internally and by third parties has \nfound that “[t]he main threats to whales are vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement.”8 \nBOEM has announced that “[a]ll current evidence indicates that there are no links between large \nwhale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”9  \n42.  After extensive studies, NMFS has reached similar conclusions. As of the filing of \nthis Complaint, NMFS’s website still affirms: “We work with our partners to analyze and \nunderstand the causes of death when we are able, following the science and data. At this point, \nthere is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization \nsurveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale \ndeaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”10 \n43.  In numerous court cases, the government has successfully defended the \nsufficiency of BOEM’s review and accuracy of its conclusions, demonstrating that the relevant \nagencies fulfilled all statutory environmental review and protection obligations. See, e.g., \n \n7 Defendants’ Memorandum In Opposition To Summary Judgment, Seafreeze Shoreside, Inc. v. Department of the \nInterior,  No. 1:22-cv-11091-IT, ECF No. 75 (D.

To date, BLM has issued 43 right of way grants for wind energy projects on \nfederal public lands.  \n45.  These projects have likewise undergone extensive, multi-level and, in many cases, \nmulti-agency environmental review. BLM conducted a programmatic environmental impact \nstatement (“PEIS”) of the impacts that would be associated with wind energy development on \nthe roughly 20 million acres of public lands in 11 western states with wind energy potential.  \nThis review analyzed “the positive and negative environmental, social, and economic impacts; \ndiscussion of relevant mitigation measures to address these impacts; and identification of \nappropriate, programmatic policies and best management practices (BMPs) to be included” in \nthe 52 BLM land use plans amended following the completion of the PEIS.11 BLM concluded \nthat “[e]ffective mitigation measures could be implemented to address many of the direct and \nindirect adverse impacts that could occur” and that “[t]he potential impacts of wind energy \ndevelopment on local and regional economies would be largely beneficial.”12  \n46.  The PEIS contemplated that the agency would supplement its analysis with site-\nspecific reviews. Before approving any specific project, BLM prepares a project-specific \nassessment of potential environmental effects including effects to air quality, bat populations and \nroosting habitat, avian populations, eagles, greater sage-grouse, climate and greenhouse gas \nemissions, endangered and threatened species, wetlands, and cultural resources. The review also \n \n11 BOEM, Wind Energy Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (2005), \nhttps://windeis.anl.gov/documents/fpeis/index.cfm. \n12 Id. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 15 of 63\n \nconsiders economic factors such as employment, local and regional economies, residential \nproperty values, fire and fuels management, livestock, and recreation.   \n47.  Following such review, BLM has determined that granting ROWs for wind \nenergy projects “contributes to the public interest in developing renewable energy to meet \nFederal and state goals” and that project terms and conditions designed to minimize, monitor, \nand mitigate environmental and economic effects “will ensure that authorization of this project \nwill protect environmental resources and comply with environmental standards.”13  \n48.  BLM has also successfully defended its thorough review of wind energy projects \non BLM lands in court, showing that the review is sufficient and consistent with all statutory \nobligations. See, e.g., Protect our Communities Found. v. Salazar, No. 12cv2211-GPC PCL, \n2013 WL 5947137, at *18 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2013), aff'd sub nom. Backcountry Against Dumps \nv. Jewell, 674 F. App’x 657 (9th Cir. 2017); Protect Our Communities Found. v. Jewell, 825 F.3d \n571 (9th Cir. 2016). \nII.  Wind Projects on Non-Federal Lands. \n49.  Of the over 60,000 utility scale wind turbines installed in the United States, 99 \npercent are on nonfederal lands. Many of these projects entail limited federal approvals. \n50.  The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy \nhas recognized that “[w]ind energy projects provide many economic benefits” to states and local \ncommunities. These benefits include “direct and indirect employment, land lease payments, local \ntax revenue, and lower electricity rates–plus other financial incentives. Although these benefits \ndepend on factors such as location, size, and ownership, the overall economic impacts of wind \n \n13Tule Wind Project, BLM Record of Decision (2011) (DOI Control Number: FES 11-06),  \nhttps://www.tulewindeccmp.com/Record%20of%20Decision.pdf.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 16 of 63\n \nenergy development are easy to see. Wind energy projects create jobs and provide a revenue \nsource for farmers and ranchers—which can be spent in the neighboring community.”14  \n51.  Those developing wind projects on private lands have a right to decide the best \neconomic use of their property without having their economic interests arbitrarily held hostage \nby a policy of withholding federal approvals. Similarly, states, localities and tribes have a \nsovereign right to develop property that they own, free of arbitrary restrictions on federal \napprovals imposed by federal agencies.  \n52.  Regulation of wind projects on private property primarily implicates issues of \nland use and economic development that are within the historic police power of states and \nlocalities. Some states have state siting councils or boards that have mandatory siting jurisdiction \nover state and local permits for wind energy facilities. In states with no state siting process, wind \nenergy projects are permitted by the local government. \n53.  These states and localities generally have applicable environmental and public \nsafety laws with which any construction project must comply. Projects on non-federal lands \ngenerally undergo extensive environmental and public interest review at the state and local \nlevels. \n54.  Given that the states and localities have siting authority and are responsible for \ndetermining whether wind energy development is in the public interest, the federal government’s \nrole in this permitting process is highly circumscribed, though federal approval may nonetheless \nbe needed before a project can proceed.  \n55.  For example, if a project on private lands impacts jurisdictional wetlands, the \nCorps may need to issue an authorization under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, or USFWS \n \n14 WINDExchange, Economics and Incentives for Wind, U.S. Department of Energy, \nhttps://windexchange.energy.gov/projects/economics. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 17 of 63\n \nmay need to issue an incidental take permit relating to an endangered species. The federal \nagencies may have to conduct environmental analyses before issuing these permits, but the \nanalysis is generally limited to the environmental impacts associated with the specific activity \nrequiring the federal permit, not the energy project as a whole. Moreover, though the Corps is \nrequired to engage in a public interest review that includes an evaluation of economic need for \nthe project, “[w]hen private enterprise makes application for a permit, it will generally be \nassumed that appropriate economic evaluations have been completed, the proposal is \neconomically viable, and is needed in the market place.” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(q). \n56.  In other words, federal agencies generally defer to state and local decisions, and \nbusiness decisions, to site renewable energy development on private lands. To do otherwise \nwould offend fundamental notions of federalism and states’ rights. By ordering federal agencies \nto step into the shoes of states, localities, and businesses, and perform an independent (and \nunnecessary) evaluation of, inter alia, the merits of wind energy development generally, the Wind \nBan seeks to grant the federal administrative state authority to usurp police powers belonging to \nthe states.  \n57.  The Wind Ban also impairs the rights of owners and lessees of private property, \nwho are entitled to develop their property free of arbitrary restrictions imposed by the federal \ngovernment for its own policy reasons. Applicable federal laws do not authorize defendant \nfederal agencies to hold private property rights hostage to their policy agenda or systematically \ntarget and obstruct particular types of private economic development. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 18 of 63\n \nIII.  Defendants’ Unlawful Actions to Halt All Wind Permitting.  \n58.  On the new Administration’s first day in office, the above-referenced Presidential \nMemorandum effectuated an unlawful cessation of all wind energy federal permitting on private \nland and public onshore and offshore lands and waters. See Exhibit A.  \n59.  Section 2(a) of the Presidential Memorandum states: \nIn light of various alleged legal deficiencies underlying the Federal Government’s leasing \nand permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects, the consequences of which may \nlead to grave harm — including negative impacts on navigational safety interests, \ntransportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and marine \nmammals — and in light of potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews \nrequired by the National Environmental Policy Act to lease or permit wind projects, the \nSecretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the heads of all other \nrelevant agencies, shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, \nleases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a \ncomprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting \npractices.  The Secretary of the Interior shall lead that assessment and review in \nconsultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, the \nSecretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nthe Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency.  The assessment shall consider the environmental impact of onshore and \noffshore wind projects upon wildlife, including, but not limited to, birds and marine \nmammals.  The assessment shall also consider the economic costs associated with the \nintermittent generation of electricity and the effect of subsidies on the viability of the \nwind industry. \n \n60.  The Presidential Memorandum provides no explanation of the vaguely stated \n“alleged legal deficiencies” or “potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews” \nunderlying the Federal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind \nprojects, or of how or why it determined that they warrant the immediate cessation of all Federal \nwind leasing and permitting. Likewise, the Presidential Memorandum provides no explanation of \nwhy the “alleged legal deficiencies” or “potential inadequacies” warrant a “comprehensive \nassessment and review,” accompanied by a blanket cessation of wind permitting, even though \nfederal agencies have repeatedly conducted such analyses on both programmatic and project-\n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 19 of 63\n \nspecific bases and have successfully defended their decisions in court. It is irrational for the \nAdministration to rely on unfounded legal allegations that courts have uniformly rejected. The \nPresidential Memorandum does not even affirmatively claim that any such deficiencies or harms \nin fact exist for wind projects, instead utilizing qualified terms like “alleged,” “may,” and \n“potential.” Furthermore, based on the plain language of the Presidential Memorandum, it is \nquestionable whether the “comprehensive environmental assessment” will address all of the so-\ncalled—and conspicuously undefined—“grave harm” outlined in the document. For example, \nanalysis of the cost of intermittent electricity generation or the impact of wind subsidies does not \nrelate to purported navigational safety and transportation concerns. Taken together, these vague \nand unsupported allegations against the wind industry strongly suggest that the true basis for the \nPresidential Memorandum is an unfounded animus against the wind energy industry, and the \ndesire to deliver on a campaign promise to stop all wind energy development.  \n61.  Defendants have adopted policies that seek to expedite domestic energy \nproduction but exclude the wind industry from their terms. One executive order issued on the \nsame day as the Presidential Memorandum declares a national energy emergency and directs \nagencies to use emergency authorities to facilitate energy production, but arbitrarily excludes \nwind energy from its provisions. Executive Order 14156, Declaring a National Energy \nEmergency, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (January 20, 2025), Section 8(a) (“The term ‘energy’ or ‘energy \nresources’ means crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum \nproducts, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and \ncritical minerals ….”). That executive order specifically directs in Sections 4 and 5 that agencies \nuse emergency procedures to expedite covered Corps actions and Endangered Species Act (ESA) \nactions and directs in Section 6 that agencies convene the so-called “God Squad” committee, \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 20 of 63\n \nwhich can overrule ESA Section 7, to further expedite covered ESA actions. Another same-day \nexecutive order directs agencies to revise regulations and permitting processes to facilitate \nenergy production, again arbitrarily excluding wind energy. Executive Order 14154, Unleashing \nAmerican Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (January 20, 2025), Section 3 (“with particular attention to \noil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources”). \nDespite the Administration’s broad endorsement of domestic energy production from multiple \nsources, the Wind Ban singularly, summarily, and systemically discriminate against wind.  \n62.  The Wind Ban has induced agencies to disregard their statutory obligations under \napplicable laws, as set forth in this complaint. Implementation has, and will continue to, \nunlawfully bring to a halt onshore and offshore wind energy development on both public and \nprivate lands. \n63.  The Administration does not have statutory or constitutional authority to \nunilaterally halt wind development without any documented reasoned basis and in disregard of \napplicable law. \n64.  As evidenced by the cessation of all wind energy leasing, permitting, and \napproval processes across all agencies, the Wind Ban is being implemented, and each decision to \nimplement constitutes a final agency action, even if the agencies have not all formally announced \ntheir decision to implement to the public. No federal agency has given any indication that it \nintends to defy the Presidential Memorandum by proceeding to issue legally required decisions \non permits and authorizations for wind projects.  \n65.  DOI issued a memorandum on January 20, 2025, suspending certain delegations \nof decision-making authority within the Department. On January 29, 2025, DOI issued a revised \nmemorandum that restored all but five of those delegations. Among the delegations that \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 21 of 63\n \nremained suspended was the delegation of authority “to issue any onshore or offshore renewable \nenergy authorization, including but not limited to a lease, amendment to a lease, right of way, \namendment to a right of way, contract, or any other agreement required to allow for renewable \nenergy development.” DOI Order No. 3395, Amendment No. 1 (Jan. 29, 2025).  As a result, \nduring the term of that memorandum, authorizations and agreements relating to renewable \nenergy development, including wind energy, had to be approved by an Assistant Secretary, the \nSolicitor, the Deputy Secretary, or the Secretary.  \n66.  BOEM’s website with lease and grant information for renewable energy now \nbegins with the following statement: “The Department of the Interior and BOEM are \nimplementing President Trump’s memorandum temporarily halting offshore wind leasing on the \nOuter Continental Shelf. The memorandum also pauses new or renewed approvals, rights of way, \npermits, leases or loans for offshore wind projects pending a review of federal wind leasing and \npermitting practices.”15   \n67.  On January 28, BOEM posted a notice for its virtual public meetings on the \nProgrammatic Environmental Impact Statement for Potential Mitigation of Future Development \nof Wind Lease Areas Offshore California stating that the meetings had been postponed.  The \nnotice stated: “The Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are \nimplementing the Administration’s Presidential Memorandum (PM) temporarily halting offshore \nwind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf.

On February 2, BOEM posted the following notice on its website: “The \nDepartment of the Interior and BOEM are implementing President Trump’s memorandum \ntemporarily halting offshore wind leasing on the OCS. The memorandum also pauses new or \nrenewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for offshore wind projects pending a \nreview of federal wind leasing and permitting practices….

The FAST-41 permitting dashboard for the SouthCoast Offshore Wind project \ncontains a notation citing the Presidential Memorandum and stating that, because of this \ndirective, “the milestone date for the final rule has been extended three months to allow time to \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 23 of 63\n \ncomplete the final rule. In addition, the final Marine Mammal Protection Act (“MMPA”) \nmilestone has also been shifted by 3 months to allow for the 30-day rule cooling off period \nbetween publication of the final rule and issuance of the ITA decision.

The date for completion of the SouthCoast Offshore Wind Clean Water Act permit has \nlikewise been extended, citing the Presidential Memorandum. \nhttps://www.permits.performance.gov/sites/permits.dot.gov/files/2025-02/2025-02-\n26%20SouthCoast%20Executive%20Director%20Determination.pdf  \n71.  Upon information and belief, the Corps has stopped all new CWA jurisdictional \ndeterminations, environmental assessments, public notices, and other permitting activities only \nfor wind projects. The Corps initially paused all projects for renewable energy projects, and then \nresumed permitting for all renewables apart from wind. A press article on February 12, 2025, \nquoted an email from Corps spokesman Douglas Garman as stating “The pause was lifted for \nrenewable projects, and the pause remains in place for wind and wind-related projects in \naccordance with the attached Executive Order.” The article states that the latter reference is to the \nJanuary 20 Presidential Memorandum. \n72.  USFWS has posted a notice on its website stating that the USFWS, “pursuant to \nExecutive Order ‘Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the OCS from Offshore Wind \nLeasing[’] … is temporarily ceasing issuance of eagle permits to wind facilities until further \nnotice. In the interim, ePermits will no longer automatically issue general permits.” \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 24 of 63\n \nhttps://fwsepermits.servicenowservices.com/fws?id=fws_kb_view&sys_id=63943c8edbb042900\na66e46b13961966. USFWS’s spreadsheet tracking eagle incidental take permits issued for wind \nprojects lists 111 permits issued in 2024 and 6 issued in 2025, a pace of approximately 9 such \npermits per month. On information and belief, no such permits have been issued since January \n20, 2025.   \n73.  Upon information and belief, the USFWS has stopped issuing technical assistance \nletters (TAL) to all wind projects. TALs are advisory documents that provide project applicants \nwith guidance regarding how a proposed project or action might affect federally listed species \nunder the ESA.  \n74.  USFWS sent the following email in response to requests to discuss wind projects: \n“Pursuant to Executive Order ‘Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental \nShelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and \nPermitting Practices for Wind Projects’, [USFWS is] unable to communicate with wind facilities \nregarding permitting at this time.\" \n75.  In implementing the Wind Ban, agencies have provided no explanation, beyond \nciting the Presidential Memorandum, for refusing to authorize wind permits contrary to their \nstatutory obligations. Equally, the agencies have provided no opportunity for the public to \ncomment on actions that amount to substantive policy and regulatory changes. \n76.  ACE NY and its members are experiencing severe and ongoing harms as a direct \nresult of the Wind Ban and federal agencies’ failure to issue necessary permits and approvals. \nThese harms include substantial daily costs incurred in connection with wind projects in \ndevelopment that cannot proceed without federal permits, costs in the form of lost income from \nprojects whose completion has been greatly delayed or cancelled, impairment of legal \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 25 of 63\n \nobligations under existing contracts, and harms to financing of projects affected by the severe \nuncertainty caused by the Wind Ban. The Wind Ban has also caused and continues to cause \nsevere harm to the wind energy supply chain, including substantial loss of business for suppliers, \nescalating costs for materials for wind energy projects, disruption of contracts for specialized \ntransportation and installation equipment, and the potential closure of some businesses. Because \nthe wind energy industry is an integrated nationwide industry, these harms are not specific to the \nimplementation of the Wind Ban in the State of New York, but are occurring as a result of its \nimplementation nationwide.  If federal agencies resume issuing permits and approvals, these \nharms will be mitigated or cease.   \nLEGAL  BACKGROUND \nI.  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act  \n \n77.  Congress enacted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”) more than \n70 years ago. OCSLA declares the Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) to be “a vital national \nresource reserve held by the Federal Government for the public,” and directs the Secretary of the \nInterior to make the Shelf “available for expeditious and orderly development, subject to \nenvironmental safeguards, in a manner which is consistent with the maintenance of competition \nand other national needs.” 43 U.S.C. §1332(3); see also Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 781 F. \nSupp. 2d 332, 339 (E.D. La. 2011) (noting “OCSLA’s overriding policy of expeditious \ndevelopment”). \n78.  In 2005, Congress amended OCSLA to support the development of offshore wind \nprojects. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, § 1337, as amended by Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nPub L. No. 109-58, § 388, 119 Stat. 744 (2005); Seafreeze Shoreside, Inc., 123 F.4th at 26  \n(stating that OCLSA is a statute that encourages the development of offshore wind projects). \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 26 of 63\n \nOCSLA allows the Secretary to “grant a lease, easement, or right of way” for activities that \n“produce or support production, transportation, storage, or transmission of energy sources other \nthan oil and gas,” namely offshore wind. 43 U.S.C § 1337(p)(1)(C). The 2005 Amendments \noblige the Secretary, in processing such applications, to ensure the project “is carried out in a \nmanner” consistent with specified criteria. 43 U.S.C § 1337(p)(4). This includes requirements for \nthe Secretary to balance potentially competing environmental, health, safety, navigational, \nnational security, and other specified concerns. Id. OCSLA further requires the Secretary to \nundertake specified activities in determining whether to issue a lease for an offshore wind \nproject, such as coordinating with other relevant permitting agencies and engaging in public \nnotice and comments for proposed leases. Id.  \n79.  Offshore wind leases are sold and processed individually in accordance with \nBOEM regulations, which were originally promulgated in 2009 and then amended pursuant to \nthe Renewable Energy Modernization Rule in 2024. 30 C.F.R. part 585. \n80.  Once BOEM has awarded a commercial lease, the lessee must submit several \ndocuments, including a Site Assessment Plan (“SAP”) and a Construction and Operations Plan \n(“COP”). 30 C.F.R. § 585.600. Non-commercial lessees and grantees must submit a SAP and \nGeneral Activities Plan (“GAP”) to BOEM. Id. A COP or GAP must describe all aspects of the \nproposed projects, such as the location of transmission infrastructure, and other key features of \nthe project. 30 C.F.R. §§ 585.626, 585.645.  \n81.  BOEM regulations bind BOEM in its administration of activities on offshore \nwind leases. The regulations require that BOEM issue or deny requested approvals based on the \nrespective merits of each request. They provide that BOEM will review a submitted SAP, COP, \nor GAP; that BOEM will notify the applicant if the application is incomplete; and that upon \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 27 of 63\n \ncompletion of the review BOEM will approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions a SAP, \nCOP, or GAP. See 30 C.F.R. §§ 585.613, 585.628, 585.648. The regulations further establish that \nif a permit is denied, the applicant will have an opportunity to re-submit a revised plan. Id. The \nregulations also require BOEM to prepare (pursuant to NEPA) an analysis of potential \nenvironmental and economic effects in the course of issuing these approvals.  Id. \n82.  These regulations make clear that BOEM is required to process permit \napplications and make decisions on permits and does not have authority to abdicate this \nresponsibility. \nII.  The Federal Land Policy and Management Act. \n83.  Enacted in 1976, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (“FLPMA”), 43 \nU.S.C. § 1701 et seq., is a planning statute that governs the Secretary’s and BLM’s \nadministration of onshore public lands. \n84.  Among other requirements, FLPMA provides that the Secretary “shall, with \npublic involvement … develop, maintain and, when appropriate, revise land use plans.” 43 \nU.S.C § 1712(a). These plans, known as resource management plans (“RMPs”) are developed by \nthe BLM, the agency designated by the Secretary to comply with FLMPA’s requirements. 43 \nC.F.R. § 1610.1(b).  \n85.  In an RMP, BLM can, following public input, designate sections of public lands \nas open or closed for certain uses, including rights of way for wind energy, and may identify \nstipulations that will attach to such activities. \n86.  FLPMA mandates specific procedures prior to the Secretary closing an area to a \nparticular use. The statute requires that the Secretary notify both chambers of Congress of a \ndecision in an RMP “that excludes (that is, totally eliminates) one or more of the principal or \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 28 of 63\n \nmajor uses for two or more years with respect to a tract of land of one hundred thousand acres or \nmore.” 43 U.S.C. § 1712(e)(2). A “principal or major use” is defined to include rights of way. \nSee id. § 1702(l). \n87.  Once finalized, the Secretary is prohibited from taking actions on public lands \ninconsistent with the provisions of the applicable RMP. See 43 U.S.C. § 1732(a) (“The Secretary \nshall manage the public lands … in accordance with the land use plans developed by” his or her \npredecessors…); 43 C.F.R. § 1610.5-3(a) (“All future resource management authorizations and \nactions … shall conform to the approved plan.”). \n88.  BLM’s promulgation of, or amendments to, RMPs are treated as major federal \nactions with environmental consequences that are analyzed pursuant to NEPA. Consequently, \nthese actions trigger BLM’s obligations under NEPA and require the agency to analyze the \nenvironmental and economic impacts of such actions.    \n89.  FLPMA further provides that rights of way “shall be granted, issued, or renewed \n… under such regulations or stipulations, consistent with the provisions of this subchapter or any \nother applicable law, and shall also be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary \nconcerned may prescribe regarding extent, duration, survey, location, construction, maintenance, \ntransfer or assignment, and termination.” 43 U.S.C. § 1764(c). BLM has adopted regulations \nspecifically governing issuance of rights of way for renewable projects (wind and solar) on BLM \nlands. “Rights of Way, Leasing, and Operations for Renewable Energy,” 43 C.F.R. part 2800. \nFLPMA requires that before suspending a right of way the Secretary give the holders “written \nnotice …. of the grounds of such action and shall give the holder a reasonable time … to comply \nwith this subchapter condition, rule, or regulation.” 43 U.S.C. § 1766. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 29 of 63\n \n90.  FLPMA also provides requirements for the withdrawal of lands from future uses. \n“Withdrawal” is defined as “withholding an area of Federal land from settlement, sale, location, \nor entry under some or all of the general land laws, for the purpose of limiting activities under \nthose laws in order to maintain other public values in the area or reserving the area for a \nparticular public purpose or program.” 43 U.S.C § 1702(j). \n91.  The Secretary may only “make, modify, extend, or revoke withdrawals” of public \nlands “in accordance with the provisions and limitations” of FLPMA. 43 U.S.C. § 1714(a). \nSpecifically, the Secretary “shall publish a notice in the Federal Register” outlining the proposed \nwithdrawal and the “extent to which the land is to be segregated while the application is being \nconsidered by the Secretary.” 43 U.S.C. § 1714(b)(1).  \n92.  For withdrawals totaling five thousand acres or more, such withdrawals may be \n“only for a period of not more than twenty years” and the Secretary “shall notify both Houses of \nCongress … no later than its effective date.” 43 U.S.C. § 1714(c)(1).  \n93.  The Secretary may withdraw public lands from development in an emergency, but \nonly if “an emergency situation exists” and “extraordinary measures must be taken to preserve \nvalues that would otherwise be lost.” Such withdrawal “shall last only for a period not to exceed \nthree years and may not be extended” except in limited situations. 43 U.S.C. § 1714(e). \n94.  Upon information and belief, no previous Administration has indefinitely closed \nor withdrawn all onshore public lands from wind energy development. \n95.  BLM’s regulations delineate BLM’s land use planning process, including that the \npublic shall be provided “opportunities to meaningfully participate in and comment on the \npreparation of plans, amendments and related guidance and be given early notice of planning \nactivities.” 43 C.F.R. § 1610.2. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 30 of 63\n \n96.  BLM’s regulations bind BLM in its administration of onshore wind energy \nactivities on BLM-managed lands. They require BLM to issue or deny requested approvals based \non the respective merits of each request. The regulations provide that BLM will prioritize certain \nwind applications and evaluate the application based on the information provided by the \napplicant and input from other parties, such as federal, State, Tribal, and local government \nagencies, as well as comments received in preliminary application review meetings and any \npublic meeting held under this section. 43 C.F.R § 2804.25. The regulations further provide that \nbased on these evaluations, in processing the application BLM will “[t]ake any other action \nnecessary to fully evaluate and decide whether to approve or deny [an] application.” Id. \n97.  BLM may only deny a right of way application for specific reasons detailed in \nBLM regulations. 43 C.F.R. § 2804.26.  \n98.  These statutory and regulatory provisions impose non-discretionary \nresponsibilities that BLM does not have authority to abdicate.  \nIII.  Clean Water Act Section 404. \n99.  Congress enacted the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) in 1972 to “restore and maintain \nthe chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a). \n100.  Section 404 of the CWA requires developers to obtain a permit from the Corps \nprior to discharging dredge and fill material into waters of the United States. 33 U.S.C. \n§§ 1344(a), 1362.  \n101.  The CWA allows the Corps to process Section 404 permits individually, or to \ncreate general permits for activities that “are similar in nature, will cause only minimal adverse \nenvironmental effects when performed separately, and will have only minimal cumulative \nadverse effect on the environment.” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(1).  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 31 of 63\n \n102.  Section 404 also provides that the Corps shall “minimize … delays in the issuance \nof permits” by entering into agreements with other agencies to ensure a decision will be reached \non a permit application “to the maximum extent practicable …  not later than the ninetieth day \nafter the date the notice for such application is published.” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(q).  \n103.  The Corps’ regulations have reinforced this statutory mandate in the context of \nenergy projects, as they have designated “energy conservation and development [as a] major \nnational objective” and have therefore directed district engineers “to give high priority to the \nprocessing of permit actions involving energy projects.” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4.   \n104.  Section 404 of the CWA and its implementing regulations impose requirements on \nthe Corps’ processing of dredge and fill permits. For example, when processing individual \nSection 404 permits, the Corps’ regulations provide that public notice “will” be issued within 15 \ncalendar days of receipt of a complete application. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2.  \n105.  Additionally, the regulations mandate that the Corps “will decide on all \napplications not later than 60 [calendar] days after receipt of a complete application,” unless \n“[i]nformation needed by the district engineer for a decision on the application cannot reasonably \nbe obtained within the 60-day period.” Id. \n106.  With respect to general permits, if a Nationwide Permit (“NWP”) requires the \napplicant to submit a pre-construction notification, the Corps’ regulations provide that the district \nengineers are required to respond within 45 days (barring limited exceptions for non-federal \npermittees who meet specified conditions). Should the Corps fail to respond within this \nadministrative deadline, “the activity is deemed authorized by the NWP,” and the district \nengineers must act in accordance with specified procedures before modifying, suspending, or \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 32 of 63\n \nrevoking the NWP authorization. Reissuance and Modification of Nationwide Permits, 86 Fed. \nReg. 73522 (Dec. 27, 2021); 33 C.F.R. § 330.1(e)(1); 33 C.F.R. § 330.5. \n107.  The CWA and implementing regulations demonstrate that once the Corps receives \nan application for a Section 404 permit, it must process and render a timely decision on the \napplication in accordance with relevant provisions of the CWA and implementing regulations, \nand does not have authority to take actions inconsistent with these requirements. \nIV.  Clean Water Act Section 402. \n108.  Pursuant to the CWA, the EPA Administrator may issue a National Pollutant \nDischarge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit for the discharge of any pollutant or \ncombination of pollutants if the requested discharge meets the requirements provided in the \nstatute. 33 U.S.C. § 1342.  See also 33 U.S.C. § 1342(b); 40 C.F.R. § 123.1 (providing for \napproval of State permitting programs).   \n109.  EPA’s regulations provide procedures for submitting permit applications.  40 \nC.F.R. § 122.21. The Administrator is required to review NPDES permit applications for \ncompleteness within 30 days of receipt. 40 C.F.R. § 124.3(c). The Administrator or other \nappropriate official must also send the permit applicant a timeline no later than the effective date \nof the permit that outlines the dates by which the official will: \"(1) Prepare a draft permit; (2) \nGive public notice; (3) Complete the public comment period, including any public hearing; and \n(4) Issue a final permit.\" Id. § 124.3(g); see also 40 C.F.R. §§ 122.62, 124.5 (procedures for \nmodifying, revoking, and reissuing permits).   \n110.  Pursuant to these provisions, both onshore and offshore wind facilities may be \nrequired to obtain a NPDES permit in certain circumstances. EPA is required to act on such \npermit applications and does not have authority to ignore this obligation.    \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 33 of 63\n \nV.   Rivers and Harbors Act Sections 10 and 14. \n111.  Under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (“RHA”), “[t]he creation \nof any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by Congress, to the navigable capacity of any of \nthe waters of the United States is hereby prohibited ….” 33 U.S.C. § 403. \n112.  Section 10 also provides that it “shall not be lawful to build … structures in any \nport, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, navigable river, or other water of the United States …” or \nto “excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or \ncapacity of, any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, lake, harbor or refuge …[or] channel of \nany navigable water of the United States,” except as recommended and authorized by the Corps. \nId. \n113.  Section 14 of the RHA makes it unlawful for any person or persons “take \npossession of or make use of for any purpose, or build upon, alter, deface, destroy, move, injure, \nobstruct by fastening vessels thereto or otherwise, or in any manner whatever impair the \nusefulness of any sea wall, bulkhead, jetty, dike, levee, wharf, pier, or other work built by the \nUnited States ….” 33 U.S.C. § 408. \n114.  However, the Secretary, “on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, may \ngrant permission for the temporary occupation or use of any of the aforementioned public works \nwhen in his judgment such occupation or use will not be injurious to the public interest.” Id. \n115.  The Corps issues permits and permission under these statutory authorities. 33 \nC.F.R. § 320.2. The Corps’ regulations recognize that “energy conservation and development are \nmajor national objectives” and provide that “[d]istrict engineers will give high priority to the \nprocessing of permit actions involving energy projects.” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 34 of 63\n \n116.  Corps regulations set forth specific requirements that must be fulfilled when the \nagency processes RHA Section 10 permits.  \n117.  With respect to individual permits, Corps regulations provide that the agency \n“shall” notify the applicant of an incomplete Section 10 application within 15 calendar days. 33 \nC.F.R. § 325.2.  They also provide that public notice “will” be issued within 15 calendar days of \nreceipt of complete application. Id. They establish that “[d]istrict engineers will decide on all \napplications not later than 60 [calendar] days after receipt of a complete application,” unless \n“[i]nformation needed by the district engineer for a decision on the application cannot reasonably \nbe obtained within the 60-day period.” Id. \n118.  For NWPs, “[e]xcept for activities conducted by non-federal permittees that \nrequire [pre-construction notifications] under paragraph (c) of the “Endangered Species” and \n“Historic Properties” general conditions (general conditions 18 and 20, respectively), if the \nCorps district does not respond to the [pre-construction notification] within 45 days of a receipt \nof a complete [pre-construction notification], the activity is deemed authorized by the NWP.” \nReissuance and Modification of Nationwide Permits, 86 Fed. Reg. 73,522 (Dec. 27, 2021).  \n119.   Once a permit application for a Section 10 permit is received, the Corps is \nrequired to process and render a timely decision on the permit applications. The Corps does not \nhave authority to take actions inconsistent with these requirements. \nV.   The Endangered Species Act. \n120.  The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) prohibits the “take” of any endangered or \nthreatened species. 16 U.S.C. § 1538(a). \n121.  Section 7 of the ESA requires federal agencies approving, funding, or carrying out \nactivities to ensure such actions will not “jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 35 of 63\n \nspecies or threatened species …” 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2).  To meet this requirement, Federal \nagencies must consult with USFWS or NMFS if an endangered or threatened species may be \npresent in the area of a proposed action. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2).  \n122.  For the purposes of complying with requirements of Section 7, the action agency \nis required to prepare a biological assessment (BA) identifying any endangered or threatened \nspecies which is likely to be affected by an action, for any action where an endangered or \nthreatened species may be present. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(c)(1). \n123.  If after consultation, the Secretary concludes that the agency action will not \nviolate the ESA, or offers reasonable and prudent alternatives that will not violate the ESA, and \nthe taking of an endangered or threatened species will be incidental to the agency action, the \nSecretary shall prepare and provide the action agency and any applicant concerned a Biological \nOpinion and incidental take statement specifying the impact of such incidental taking, specifying \nreasonable and prudent measures necessary to minimize such impact, and setting forth terms and \nconditions that must be complied with to implement those measures. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(4). \n124.  USFWS and NMFS regulations set forth specific requirements that must be \nfulfilled during the Section 7 process. For BAs, the regulations require the Director to respond \nwithin 30 days to a notification or request from a federal agency. 50 C.F.R. § 402.12. They \nfurther provide that after a federal agency submits a BA, the “Director will respond in writing \nwithin 30 days as to whether or not he concurs with the findings of the biological assessment.” \n50 C.F.R. 402.12(j). For informal consultations, “the Service shall provide written concurrence \nor non-concurrence with the Federal agency's determination [that the action is not likely to \nadversely affect listed species or critical habitat] within 60 days” of a written request. 50 C.F.R. \n§ 402.13 (emphasis added). A formal consultation must conclude “within 90 days after its \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 36 of 63\n \ninitiation unless extended as provided below,” and “[w]ithin 45 days after concluding formal \nconsultation, the Service shall deliver a biological opinion to the Federal agency and \nany applicant.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(e) (emphasis added). \n125.  For projects on private lands without a federal nexus, Section 10 of the ESA \nprovides a critical exception to the prohibition on “taking” endangered species by allowing a \nperson to obtain an “incidental take” permit. 16 U.S.C. § 1539. Section 10 of the ESA provides \nthat the USFWS or NMFS may issue such a permit for “any taking otherwise prohibited by \n[Section 9] if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise \nlawful activity.” 16 U.S.C. § 1539(a)(1)(B). To receive an “incidental take” permit, an applicant \nmust submit a “conservation plan” to the USFWS or NMFS in a manner consistent with the \nrequirements provided by Section 10. Id. \n126.  Upon the receipt of an ESA Section 10 application, the ESA requires the USFWS \nand NMFS to publish notice of the application in the Federal Register and to provide an \n“opportunity for public comment” on the application and the corresponding proposed habitat \n“conservation plan.” 16 U.S.C. § 1539(a)(2)(B). Furthermore, the ESA mandates that the \nUSFWS or NMFS “shall issue the [incidental take] permit” if they determine that the applicant \nwill meet the requirements specified in Section 10. Id.; 50 C.F.R. parts 13,  17, 222, 402. \n127.  USFWS and NMFS regulations provide specific non-discretionary actions the \nagencies must take when processing and issuing incidental take permits. USFWS regulations \nprovide that “[t]he Service will process the application when the Director determines the \napplication is complete.” 50 C.F.R. § 17.22(b)(1). The regulations further provide that “[u]pon \nreceiving … [ a completed] application … the Director will decide whether a permit should be \nissued.” 50 C.F.R. § 17.22(b)(2). NMFS regulations provide that “NMFS will attempt to process \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 37 of 63\n \napplications deemed sufficient in the shortest possible time” 50 C.F.R. § 222.302(b). NMFS \nregulations further provide that the “Assistant Administrator shall issue the permit unless” the \nAdministrator makes certain findings. 50 C.F.R. § 222.302(e). \n128.  These statutory and regulatory provisions impose non-discretionary obligations on \nUSFWS and NMFS that cannot be abdicated. \nVI.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act. \n129.  The MMPA generally prohibits the taking of marine mammals, with certain \nstatutory exceptions. 16 U.S.C. § 1371(a)(3).  \n130.  The Secretary may authorize the incidental—but never intentional—take of a \nsmall number of marine mammals in a specified geographic area as a result of commercial \nactivities. 16 U.S.C. § 1371(a)(5)(A). The Secretary “shall allow” the incidental taking if the \nSecretary determines that the cumulative taking “will have a negligible impact” on the species \nand that such taking “will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such \nspecies of stock for taking for subsistence uses.” Id. Finally, such taking authorization must be \nlimited to a period of not more than five consecutive years. Id.  \n131.  If the Secretary authorizes an incidental taking, the Secretary “must prescribe \nregulations setting forth: (i) permissible methods of taking pursuant to such activity, and other \nmeans of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on such species or stock and its habitat, \npaying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and on \nthe availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses; and (ii) requirements pertaining to \nthe monitoring and reporting of such taking.” 16 U.S.C. § 1371(a)(5)(A). \n132.  The MMPA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations \nrelated to the protection and conservation of whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions. 16 \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 38 of 63\n \nU.S.C. § 1373. DOI is responsible for promulgating regulations related to all other marine \nmammals not regulated by the Secretary of Commerce. Id.  \n133.  USFWS and NMFS regulations set forth specific requirements that the agencies \nmust follow when determining whether to authorize limited incidental take of marine mammals. \nUSFWS regulations provide that “the Director shall evaluate each request to determine, based on \nthe best available scientific evidence, whether the total taking will have a negligible impact on \nthe species or stock and, where appropriate, will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the \navailability of such species or stock for subsistence uses.” 50 C.F.R. § 18.27(d)(4). The \nregulations further provide that “if the Director cannot make a finding that the total taking will \nhave a negligible impact … the Director shall publish in the Federal Register the negative \nfinding along with the basis for denying the request.” Id. Similarly, USFWS regulations provide \nthat the “Assistant Administrator shall evaluate each request to determine, based upon the best \navailable scientific evidence, whether the taking by the specified activity within the specified \ngeographic region will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and, where appropriate, \nwill not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stock for \nsubsistence uses.” 50 C.F.R. § 216.104(c). \n134.  These statutory and regulatory provisions impose non-discretionary obligations \nthat NMFS does not have authority to disregard.  \nVIII.   The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. \n135.  The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (“BGEPA”), 16 U.S.C. § 668 et seq., \nprohibits the “take” of any bald eagle or golden eagle “at any time or in any manner” “without \nbeing permitted to do so” by USFWS.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 39 of 63\n \n136.  BGEPA authorizes USFWS to authorize the take or disturbance of bald and \ngolden eagles, but only if such take “is compatible with the preservation” of eagles. Id. § 668a. \nThe statute provides for two different types of authorizations. The first type applies to activities \nwhere the taking is associated with—i.e., incidental to—but not the purpose of the permitted \nactivity (frequently known as “incidental take”). 50 C.F.R. § 22.250. The second type applies to \nthe deliberate removal of eagle nests for specific purposes (i.e., ensuring human or eagle safety). \n50 C.F.R. § 22.85. \n137.  Incidental take permits fall into two categories—specific and general.  Pursuant to \nits regulations, USFWS is required to automatically issue a general permit to an applicant, \nprovided that the applicant’s activity qualifies for a general permit and the take: (1) is necessary \nto protect a legitimate interest in a particular locality; (2) results from, but is not the purpose of, \nthe activity; and (3) cannot practicably be avoided. 50 C.F.R. § 22.210(d). The development of \nwind energy projects is specifically listed as eligible for general take permits. Id. § 22.250.  \n138.  Finally, applicants may apply for a specific permit if the activity does not meet the \neligibility criteria for a general permit or if the activity in question is not identified in USFWS \nregulations. Id. § 22.220(a). Wind energy projects that are ineligible for a general permit may \nrequest a Letter of Authorization from the USFWS to apply for a general permit. Id. § 22.220 \n(b)(7).  \n139.  These statutory and regulatory provisions impose non-discretionary obligations \nthat USFWS does not have authority to disregard.  \nIX.   The Clean Air Act. \n140.  The Clean Air Act (“CAA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401 et seq., was enacted in 1970 to, \namong other things, “protect and enhance the quality of the Nation's air resources so as to \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 40 of 63\n \npromote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7401(b). It directs the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for air \npollutants, 42 U.S.C. § 7409(b)(1), establish air quality control regions, and designate those \nregions as “attainment” for “any area …that meets” the NAAQS, “nonattainment” for “any area \nthat does not meet” the NAAQS. 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(1)(A). \n141.  Under the CAA, new “major sources,” meaning facilities with the potential to \nemit certain threshold levels of specified air pollutants, may not be constructed without a permit. \n42 U.S.C. §§ 7407(a), 7475(a), 7502(c)(5). The proposed source must obtain a Prevention of \nSignificant Deterioration (“PSD”) permit, if located in an area in attainment with relevant air \nquality standards, id. § 7475(a), or a Nonattainment New Source Review (“NNSR”) permit, if \nlocated in an area not in attainment with such standards, before beginning construction or \nmaking major modifications, id. § 7502(c)(5). \n142.  The CAA contains special requirements for activities occurring on large portions \nof the OCS. 42 U.S.C. § 7627(a)(1). The CAA requires the EPA to count certain emissions from \ncertain vessels used for construction and operation of an activity on the OCS, such as fossil fuel \nproduction or development of wind energy, in determining whether the activity constitutes a \n“major source” and will need a CAA permit based on onshore air quality effects. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7627(a)(4)(C); see also 40 C.F.R. § 55.2. The type of permit needed will depend on whether \nthe nearest onshore area and corresponding areas are attainment or nonattainment areas. 40 \nC.F.R. § 55.5. \n143.  Most New Source Review permits are issued by state or local air pollution control \nagencies. EPA issues permits in some cases. OCS air regulations are generally implemented and \nenforced by the EPA Regional Offices, but this authority may be delegated to state or local air \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 41 of 63\n \npermitting agencies that meet specific criteria. To date, EPA has delegated authority to administer \nOCS Air Regulations to three state permitting authorities (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia) \nand four local permitting authorities in California. EPA, Outer Continental Shelf Air Permits, \nhttps://www.epa.gov/caa-permitting/outer-continental-shelf-air-permits.  \n144.  For PSD permits, the CAA provides that “[a]ny completed [PSD] permit \napplication…shall be granted or denied not later than one year after the date of filing of such \ncompleted application.” 42 U.S.C. § 7475(c). For NNSR permits, the CAA mandates that “the \npermitting authority shall approve or disapprove a completed application …within 18 months \nafter the date of receipt thereof.” Id. § 7661b(c). The CAA also specifies that “the source’s failure \nto have a permit shall not be a violation …unless the delay in the final action” was the fault of \nthe applicant. Id. § 7661b(d).  \n145.  EPA’s regulations build upon the statutory requirements. The OCS air regulations \nprovide that the Administrator will follow the applicable procedures of 40 C.F.R. part 124, which \napply to the PDS permitting program, or 40 C.F.R. part 71, which apply to the NNSR permitting \nprogram, in processing applications under this part. 40 C.F.R. § 55.6.   \n146.  The PSD regulations provide that EPA “shall” review submitted applications for \ncompleteness within 30 days of receipt. 40 C.F.R. § 124.3. EPA must notify the applicant in \nwriting regarding completeness of the application and then must decide whether to prepare a \ndraft permit or deny the permit application. Id. § 124.6. All draft permits “shall” be publicly \nnoticed and made available for public comment. Id. The regulations provide that EPA “shall” \nshall issue a final permit decision after the close of public comment. Id. § 124.15. EPA has \nannounced its goal to “make a final permit decision (to issue or deny) on a PSD permit \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 42 of 63\n \napplication within 10 months after the date that the Regional Office has determined that the \napplication is complete.”16  \n147.  The NNSR regulations provide that, unless the Administrator determines an \napplication is incomplete within 60 days of receipt, the application will be deemed complete. 40 \nC.F.R. § 71.5(a)(2). EPA “shall” take final action on each permit application (including a request \nfor permit modification or renewal) within 18 months after receiving a complete application. 40 \nC.F.R. § 71.7.   \n148.  These statutory and regulatory provisions impose non-discretionary obligations \nthat EPA does not have authority to disregard.  \nX.   FAST-41. \n \n149.  The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”) was enacted in \n2015 to streamline the environmental review and permitting process for covered infrastructure \nprojects, and evidences Congress’s intention that such projects, including wind energy projects, \nare permitted through a process that is transparent, predictable, and expeditious. \n150.  As determined by the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council \n(“FPISC”), the Act covers most offshore wind projects and several onshore wind projects, as \nwell as transmission projects and a range of other energy and infrastructure projects.    \n151.  The FAST Act establishes a process for tracking and expediting covered projects, \ngoverned by FPISC.  Under this process, the Council “shall maintain an online database to be \nknown as the ‘Permitting Dashboard’ to track the status of Federal environmental reviews and \nauthorizations for any covered project in the inventory.” 42 U.S.C. § 4370m–2(b). The Executive \n \n16 Memorandum from Stephen D. Page on Timely Processing of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Permits when EPA \nor a PSD=Delegated Air Agency Issues the Permit (Oct. 15, 2012), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-\n07/documents/timely.pdf     \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 43 of 63\n \nDirector of the Council “shall create” a specific entry on the Dashboard for projects not later than \n14 days after the project sponsor submits a notice of project initiation. Id. Lead and cooperating \nagencies “shall post” updates and information about the project status to the Dashboard “not later \nthan 5 business days after the date on which the Federal agency receives the information.” Id.  \nThe Executive Director “shall publish to the Dashboard” the permitting timetable, the status of \neach agency’s compliance with the permitting timetable, and an explanation of any modifications \nto the permitting timetable. Id. \n152.  The Act requires that the lead agency “shall establish a concise” project review \nand authorization plan 60 days after the Executive Director adds a project to the Dashboard. 42 \nU.S.C. § 4370m–2(c). This “Coordinated Project Plan” “shall include” a “permitting timetable” \nsetting forth a “comprehensive schedule of dates by which all environmental reviews and \nauthorizations, and to the maximum extent practicable, State permits, reviews and approvals \nmust be made.”  Id. The Act establishes a mandatory process for resolving disputes relating to \nthe permitting timetable.  Id. \n153.  The established project timetable can only be subsequently modified if the lead \nagency consults with the Executive Director regarding the need for modification, all agencies \ninvolved agree to the modification, the agencies consult with the project sponsor, and the \nagencies provide a written justification. Id. \n154.  In those cases where the modification would extend the completion date by more \nthan 30 days, modification must be formally approved by the Executive Director, who must \nmake a “determination on the record.” Id. Before issuing such a determination, the Executive \nDirector must consult with the project sponsor. Id. A completion date in the permitting timetable \nmay not be modified within 30 days of the completion date. Id. The statute further sets limits on \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 44 of 63\n \nthe total length of modifications: the timeline can only be extended by half of the amount of time \noriginally allotted for the project. Id. The project timetable may only be extended beyond this \nlimitation only if the Director of the Office of Management and Budget approves it and provides \na report on the extension to Congress. Id. \n155.  The statute provides that “[e]ach Federal agency shall conform to the intermediate \nand final completion dates set forth in the permitting timetable established under subparagraph \n(A), or with any intermediate or final completion date modified under subparagraph (D).” Id. If \nan agency fails to conform with an “intermediate or final completion date,” or reasonably \nbelieves it “will fail to conform with a completion date 30 days before such a completion date,” \nthe agency “shall” notify the Executive Director and propose an alternative completion date and \nsubmit status reports to the Executive Director until the agency has taken final action on the \ndelayed authorization or review. Id. \n156.  FAST-41 imposes non-discretionary responsibilities on agencies that they may not \ndisregard, and evidences Congress’s intent that agencies process permits for covered \ninfrastructure projects in a transparent, predictable, and expeditious manner. \nXI.   NEPA and the Fiscal Responsibility Act. \n \n157.  NEPA’s purpose is to focus the attention of the federal government and the public \non the potential environmental effects of proposed “major Federal actions.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321, \net seq.  \n158.  In 2023, Congress passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, a NEPA reform law that \nimposed new statutory deadlines on agency’s NEPA processes and highlighted Congress’s intent \nto streamline and expedite the environmental review process and decision-making to allow \ncritical projects to proceed without unnecessary delays. The 2023 amendments provide that the \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 45 of 63\n \nlead agency “shall complete” an environmental assessment not later than 1 year after certain \nconditions are met, and “shall complete” an EIS not later than 2 years after those conditions are \nmet. 42 U.S.C § 4336a(g).  \n159.  These amendments evidence Congress’s intent that NEPA processes and \nenvironmental decision-making be completed expeditiously to facilitate development of essential \ninfrastructure projects. \nXI.   APA Section 558 Bars Agencies From Indefinitely Declining To Take Legally \nRequired Actions on Permits and Approvals.   \n \n160.  The APA provides: “When application is made for a license required by law, the \nagency … within a reasonable time, shall set and complete proceedings required to be conducted \nin accordance with sections 556 and 557 of this title or other proceedings required by law and \nshall make its decision.” 5 U.S.C. 558(c). The APA defines the term “license” broadly, stating \nthat the term “‘includes the whole or part of any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, \ncharter, membership, statutory exemption or other form of permission.” 5 U.S.C. 551(8). The \nAPA therefore requires that federal agencies act on permits and approvals “within a reasonable \ntime” after which the agency “shall make its decision.”   \n161.  Adoption of an agency policy of indefinitely declining to take legally required \nactions on permits and approvals is inconsistent with these APA requirements.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nAdministrative Procedure Act \n(The Wind Ban Is Arbitrary and Capricious) \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n \n162.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs 1-161 as if set forth \nfully herein.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 46 of 63\n \n163.  Under the APA, a “reviewing court shall … hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction … found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n164.  Judicial review of the Wind Ban is based on applicable law and the underlying \nadministrative record. 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n165.  When a federal agency shifts its policy or reverses prior decisions, it must provide \na reasoned explanation for the change, or the action will be deemed arbitrary and capricious. \nThis is particularly true when its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests or where \nits new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy.  \n166.  Moreover, when an agency has not stated any reasons to support a decision, its \ndecision is inherently arbitrary and capricious. The agency must be able to provide the essential \nfacts upon which the administrative decision was based and explain what justifies the \ndetermination with actual evidence beyond conclusory statements. \n167.  Each agency’s implementation of the Wind Ban, including the wholesale halt of \nany new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore \nwind development, constitutes final agency action.  \n168.  Upon information and belief, no administrative record exists to support the Wind \nBan. \n169.  Defendants’ decisions to radically depart from prior policy by implementing a \nwind energy permitting cessation without offering a reasoned explanation was arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law. \n170.  There is no rational connection between the Defendants’ imposition of the Wind \nBan and the relevant facts regarding wind energy development. The safety and environmental \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 47 of 63\n \nrisks presented by wind energy development have been thoroughly studied, and there is no new \nevidence that justifies this decision.  \n171.  Defendants also fail to acknowledge that the Wind Ban impacts different \ntechnologies (onshore and offshore wind). It is arbitrary to issue a blanket directive that treats all \ntypes of wind energy projects alike, without any regard to individualized risks (or lack thereof). \n172.  The Wind Ban’s bald assertion of risks only from permitting wind energy projects \narbitrarily ignores relative risks of other forms of energy that Defendants continue to authorize \nand promote without delay or further study, notwithstanding Defendants’ own acknowledgement \nof those relative risks.  \n173.  The Wind Ban also ignores the vast body of caselaw in which courts have \nconsistently rejected claims related to wind energy’s environmental risks, in contrast to multiple \ncourt decisions recognizing relative risks of other forms of energy that Defendants nevertheless \ncontinue to authorize and promote without delay or further study. \n174.  The Wind Ban arbitrarily not only excludes wind energy from Defendants’ \nsimultaneously adopted policies to expedite multiple forms of energy production, but also singles \nout wind energy for adverse treatment. The Wind Ban has no rational basis for singling out the \nAmerican businesses and workers involved in the wind energy industry for differential treatment, \nwhich is causing and will cause severe economic burdens.  \n175.  Defendants fail to explain their departure from prior policies prioritizing and \nexpediting wind energy development, including due to the climate benefits associated with \nrenewable energy, the benefits of diversified “all of the above” energy sources, and the \ncomparative safety benefits of wind energy. Such an abrupt about-face in agency policy requires \nsubstantial justification, and no such justification exists.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 48 of 63\n \n176.  Moreover, Defendants fail to acknowledge that the Wind Ban is directly at odds \nwith the current Administration’s call to action on its declared “national energy emergency” due \nto a lack of energy generating capacity. Indeed, the Wind Ban is precisely “an undue burden on \nthe identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources” that Executive Order \n14154 directs agencies to “suspend, revise, or rescind.” Such an internal inconsistency requires \nsubstantial justification, and no such justification exists. \n177.  Agencies must take reliance interests into account in their decision-making. Wind \nenergy companies and stakeholders have acted in reliance on the longstanding policies and \nstatutes established by Congress and federal agency regulations authorizing and encouraging \ndevelopment of wind energy, and have invested billions of dollars in wind energy development \nprojects and entered into contractual agreements to construct wind energy facilities and to supply \nwind energy. The Wind Ban will compromise and potentially destroy these investments and \ncontractual agreements. Failure to consider reliance interests is arbitrary and capricious. \n178.  Agencies are required to consider costs and benefits in their decision-making.  \nThe current Administration has recently acknowledged the importance of addressing the \n“massive costs” and “restraint[s] on … economic growth and ability to build and innovate” \nassociated with federal regulation. Executive Order 14102, Unleashing Prosperity through \nDeregulation, 90 Fed. Reg. 9065 (January 31, 2025). Agencies’ implementation of the Wind Ban \nimposes extensive costs on the public and on Plaintiff’s members, in exchange for insubstantial \nand likely nonexistent benefits. Failure to consider the Wind Ban’s costs and benefits in this \ncontext is arbitrary and capricious.  \n179.  The Wind Ban arbitrarily imposes severe burdens on development of private \nproperty, as well as development of property owned by states, localities, and tribes. It also \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 49 of 63\n \narbitrarily impairs existing investment-backed expectations. The current Administration has \nissued an executive order directing agencies to “de-prioritize” “enforcement actions” that “go \nbeyond the powers vested in the Federal Government by the Constitution” and “direct the \ntermination of all such enforcement proceedings that do not comply with the Constitution, laws, \nor administration policy,” and defining an “enforcement action” as “all attempts, civil or \ncriminal, by any agency to deprive a private party of life, liberty or property, or in any way affect \na private party’s rights or obligations, regardless of the label the agency has historically placed \non the action.” Executive Order 14219, Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the \nPresident’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative, 90 Fed. Reg. 10583 \n(Feb. 19, 2025) sections 3, 6(d). Agencies implementing the Wind Ban must provide especially \nsubstantial justification for their actions to justify impairing private property rights. Defendants \ncannot provide such justification.  \n180.  Agencies are required to consider alternatives in their decision-making. The Wind \nBan is arbitrary and capricious because defendant agencies did not consider alternatives that \nmight lessen the impact of the agency action on the wind industry and others affected by the \nWind Ban. Similarly, the Wind Ban is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to articulate why \nimmediate implementation was required, despite the extensive disruption caused by that \ndecision.   \n181.  The Presidential Memorandum’s vague reference to alleged “deficiencies” in the \nenvironmental review processes undertaken in support of wind energy development does not \nidentify any such deficiency or any basis for agencies’ dramatic changes in position and provides \nno reasoned basis for agency action. Furthermore, the issues to review mandated by the \nPresidential Memorandum (i.e., impact to birds and marine mammals, effects of intermittent \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 50 of 63\n \nenergy, and impact of wind subsidies) fail to address the supposed “grave harm” it imagines from \nwind projects (such as the “negative impacts to transportation interests.”). \n182.  Because Defendants failed to acknowledge their departure from prior policy and \ndecision-making, failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the new policy, failed to consider \nimportant aspects of the alleged problem, and failed to consider reliance interests and costs and \nbenefits in this context, the Wind Ban is arbitrary and capricious. \nCOUNT II \nAdministrative Procedure Act \n(The Wind Ban Failed to Undergo Public Notice and Comment Rulemaking) \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(D) \n \n183.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs 1-182 as if set forth \nfully herein.  \n184.  A “reviewing court shall … hold unlawful and set aside agency action … found to \nbe … without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  \n185.  The Wind Ban is a substantive rule that was issued without the notice-and-\ncomment period required by 5 U.S.C. § 553. In addition, to the extent that the Wind Ban \nconflicts with existing regulatory provisions, it is also an unlawful amendment of each agency’s \nregulations conducted without observing the notice and comment process required by law.   \n186.  The Wind Ban has had substantial effects on energy resources, investments, and \njobs nationwide; those effects are of great importance to a wide range of communities and \nstakeholders, including ACE NY and its members. \n187.  Defendants have failed to elicit or consider the views of these constituents and \ntheir governments, and have failed to adequately evaluate the potentially devastating economic \nimpact of the Wind Ban on the domestic wind energy industry and the domestic supply chain that \nsupports that industry. \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 51 of 63\n \n188.  Because the Wind Ban is a substantive rule and does not fit an exception to the \nnotice-and-comment requirement, it has been adopted and implemented in violation of the \nrequirements of the APA.  \nCOUNT III \nAdministrative Procedure Act \n(The Wind Ban Is Contrary to Law) \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \n \n189.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs 1-188 as if set forth \nfully herein. \n190.  Under the APA, a reviewing court must set aside a challenged agency action that \nis found to be, inter alia, “not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” id. § 706(2)(C). \n191.  Adoption of an agency policy of indefinitely declining to take legally required \nactions on permits and approvals is inconsistent with APA Section 558 and is therefore “not in \naccordance with law.”   \n192.  The Wind Ban’s blanket cessation of permitting for offshore wind energy projects \nis contrary to law under OCSLA. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1331 et seq. OCSLA does not grant agency \nofficials authority to cease leasing and permitting for wind energy. Id. Moreover, BOEM’s \nregulations under OCSLA make clear that these agencies have a general obligation to process \npermit applications and issue permit decisions. BOEM cannot abdicate this responsibility. 30 \nC.F.R. part 585. These regulations confirm that BOEM acted “not in accordance with law” in \ncontravention of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) by failing to heed OCSLA’s clear mandate to administer \nthe permitting program. Id. \n193.  The Wind Ban’s blanket cessation of permitting for onshore wind energy projects \nis contrary to law under FLPMA. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq. FLPMA does not grant agency \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 52 of 63\n \nofficials authority to cease issuing ROW decisions for wind energy. Id. Moreover, BLM’s \nregulations make clear that BLM has an obligation to process permit applications and issue \npermitting decisions under FLPMA, and that a failure to do so constitutes a de facto revision to a \nland use plan. 43 C.F.R. Part 1600, Part 2800. These regulations confirm that BLM acted “not in \naccordance with law” in contravention of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) by failing to heed FLPMA’s clear \nmandate to administer the permitting program. Id. \n194.  The Wind Ban is contrary to law under Section 404 of the CWA. 33 U.S.C. \n§ 1344. Section 404 does not grant Corps officials authority to cease permitting and \nauthorizations for wind energy. Id. Moreover, the Corps’ regulations under CWA Section 404 \nmake clear that it has a responsibility to process permit applications and issue permit decisions, \nas well as issue wetlands-related determinations, and cannot abdicate this responsibility. 33 \nC.F.R. §§ 320, 325, 330, 331. These regulations confirm that the Corps acted “not in accordance \nwith law” in contravention of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) by failing to heed the CWA’s clear mandate \nto administer the permitting program. Id.  \n195.  The Wind Ban is contrary to law under the RHA. 33 U.S.C. §§ 403, 408. RHA \nSections 10 and 14 do not grant Corps officials authority to wholesale cease issuing wind energy \npermit decisions. Id. Moreover, the Corps’ regulations make clear that it has an obligation to \nprocess permit applications and issue permits and cannot simply abdicate this responsibility in \nresponse to a Presidential Memorandum. 33 C.F.R. parts 320, 325, 330, 331. These regulations \nconfirm that the Corps acted “not in accordance with law” in contravention of 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A) by failing to heed the RHA’s clear mandate to administer the permitting program. Id. \n196.  The Wind Ban is contrary to law under the ESA. 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq. The \nESA and USFWS and NMFS regulations make clear that those agencies have an obligation to \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 53 of 63\n \nengage in and timely complete necessary consultation and cannot simply abdicate this \nresponsibility in response to a Presidential Memorandum. 50 C.F.R. parts 13, 17, 222, 402. These \nregulations confirm that USFWS acted “not in accordance with law” in contravention of 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A) by failing to heed the ESA’s clear mandate to administer that program. Id. \n197.  The Wind Ban is contrary to law under the MMPA. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1371 et seq. The \nMMPA and NMFS and USFWS regulations make clear that those agencies have an obligation to \ndecide incidental take authorizations. 50 C.F.R. part 18. These regulations confirm that NOAA \nand USFWS acted “not in accordance with law” in contravention of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) by \nfailing to heed MMPA’s clear mandate to administer that program. Id. \n198.  The Wind Ban is contrary to law under BGEPA. 16 U.S.C. § 668. BGEPA and \nUSFWS’s regulations make clear that USFWS has an obligation to decide incidental take \nauthorizations. 50 C.F.R. part 22. These regulations confirm that USFWS acted “not in \naccordance with law” in contravention of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) by failing to heed BGEPA’s clear \nmandate to administer that program. Id. \n199.  The Wind Ban is contrary to law under the CAA. 42 U.S.C. § 7627. The CAA \ndoes not grant EPA officials authority to cease permitting wind energy. Id. Moreover, EPA’s \nregulations make clear that EPA must process permit applications and issue permit decisions. 40 \nC.F.R. § 124. These regulations confirm that EPA acted “not in accordance with law” in \ncontravention of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) by failing to heed the CAA’s clear mandate to administer \nthe permitting program. Id.   \n200.  In adopting and implementing the Wind Ban, EPA likewise acted “not in \naccordance with law” in contravention of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) by failing to heed the \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 54 of 63\n \nrequirements of the CWA and its own regulations in administering the NPDES program where \napplicable to wind projects. 33 U.S.C. § 1342; 40 C.F.R. parts 122, 124.   \n201.  By adopting and implementing the Presidential Memorandum’s indefinite and \ncategorical cessation of wind permitting, and thereby unlawfully and systematically disregarding \nthe provisions of applicable statutes and regulations, Defendant agencies have taken actions that \nare “not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” id. § 706(2)(C), and accordingly violate the \nAPA as well as the statutory and regulatory provisions cited above. \nCOUNT IV \nU.S. Constitution \n(The Wind Ban Violates the U.S. Constitution, \nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 3; Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2; Amendment V) \n202.  Plaintiffs repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs 1-201 as if set forth \nfully herein.  \n203.  Plaintiff has a right of action and courts should enjoin and declare unlawful \nofficial actions that are ultra vires and exceed the executive branch’s constitutional authority. \n204.  The U.S. Constitution vests in Congress exclusive lawmaking authority. U.S. \nConst., art. 1, § 8. The President may not, simply because of policy objections, usurp the \nlawmaking powers of Congress, and act or refuse to act in violation of the laws enacted by \nCongress. Pursuant to its authority under the property clause and the interstate commerce clause, \nCongress has established federal statutes governing permitting of all types of energy, including \nwind energy. These statutes govern management of the Outer Continental Shelf and onshore \npublic lands, and the factors agencies may consider when deciding to issue authorizations, and \nrequire agencies to affirmatively act. They do not grant the agencies the authority to indefinitely \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 55 of 63\n \nrefuse to make decisions pertaining to wind energy authorizations in an effort to halt wind \ndevelopment across the nation. The President and executive branch do not have the authority to \ndirect agencies to ignore these statutory mandates.  \n205.  Under the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress—and not the \nexecutive branch—has the “Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.” U.S. Const., art. IV, \n§ 3, cl. 2. \n206.  The executive branch has authority to regulate federal property only to the limited \nextent that Congress has delegated such authority.  \n207.  Congress’s limited delegation of authority is set forth in OCSLA, FLPMA, and \nother statutes. These statutes require agencies to issue permit and authorization decisions for \nactivities on federal lands and require agencies to follow certain processes and timeframes. The \nexecutive branch lacks constitutional authority to override legislation enacted by Congress, \nignore processes prescribed by this legislation, and unilaterally and arbitrarily cease approvals \nfor all wind projects.  \n208.  With respect to activities on non-federal property, the Constitution grants \nCongress exclusive power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce. U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. \n3. Congress has enacted legislation under which agencies are required to issue permits and \nauthorizations for certain activities occurring on private property, and on property owned by \nstates, tribes, and other governmental entities. Absent congressional action, property owners have \nthe right to develop their property, and any regulatory authority resides with states, tribes, and \nlocalities. U.S. Const. Amend. X. The executive branch does not have the authority to override \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 56 of 63\n \nlegislation enacted by Congress and impede private property rights and the interests of other \nsovereigns, by unilaterally and arbitrarily ceasing approvals for all wind projects.  \n209.  The Wind Ban unlawfully deprives owners or lessees of private property or other \nnon-federal property of their property interests without due process. U.S. Const. amend. V. The \nWind Ban also destroys rights in leases and rights of way on federal property. In general, a lease \nor right of way conveys a property interest enforceable against the government. While the nature \nof this property interest varies depending on the terms of the lease or right of way and the \nstatutory and regulatory authority under which it is leased, those investing in development of \nwind facilities have a right to due process before being deprived of their property interests. U.S. \nConst. amend. V.   \n210.  Accordingly, the Wind Ban is illegal, and agencies instead should comply with \napplicable law. \nCOUNT V \nUltra Vires \n(The Wind Ban Is Ultra Vires Action Beyond the Authority Conferred by Congress) \n \n211.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs 1-210 as if set forth \nfully herein.  \n212.  Plaintiff has a right of action and courts should enjoin and declare unlawful \nexecutive branch actions that are ultra vires and exceed statutory authority. \n213.  No act of Congress authorizes the President to order or agencies to implement a \nblanket cessation of all authorizations necessary for wind energy development. Indeed, Congress \nhas restricted such cessations of decision-making in APA § 558(c) and required agencies to act \n“within a reasonable time” on requests for licenses (defined to include permits and other \napprovals). The Wind Ban is therefore ultra vires.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 57 of 63\n \n214.  The Wind Ban is ultra vires under OCSLA. OCSLA does not provide the \nPresident or agencies the authority to unilaterally cease all permitting of wind projects on the \nOCS. \n215.  The statutory purpose of OCSLA is to ensure that the Secretary makes the OCS \n“available for expeditions and orderly development, subject to environmental safeguards, in a \nmanner which is consistent with the maintenance of competition and other national needs.” 43 \nU.S.C. § 1332(3) (emphasis added). The Wind Ban contravenes OCSLA, including its provisions \nestablishing an orderly process for carrying out development on the OCS and assigning those \npermitting obligations to DOI.  \n216.  Moreover, by ordering agencies to cease issuing all “approvals, rights of way, \npermits, leases, or loans” needed for wind energy development on the OCS, the Wind Ban \neffectively withdraws those leased areas from use and disposition. The Presidential \nMemorandum purports to preserve rights under existing leases, stating in its Section 1 that \n“[n]othing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas,” but its \nordered cessation of wind permitting in Section 2(a) gravely impairs the rights of lessees in a \nway that cannot be reconciled with the terms of existing leases. No provision of OCSLA grants \nthe President the authority to withdraw leased lands from use and disposition on the OCS. \nCongress has only authorized the President to “withdraw from disposition any of the unleased \nlands.” 43 U.S.C. § 1341(a) (emphasis added). Thus, by ordering federal agencies to effectively \nwithdraw leased areas from use, the Wind Ban violates OCSLA. \n217.  The Wind Ban is ultra vires under FLPMA. FLPMA does not provide the \nPresident authority to unilaterally cease permitting ROWs for wind energy development. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 58 of 63\n \n218.  The Wind Ban is inconsistent with underlying land use plans and constitutes a de \nfacto revision to a land use plan. FLPMA requires the Secretary to manage lands in accordance \nwith land use plans developed by the Secretary. 43 U.S.C. § 1732(a). Management decisions, \nincluding exclusions of uses such as ROWs, remain subject to reconsideration only through \nrevision of the land use plan involved. 43 U.S.C. § 1712(e). Revision of land use plans requires \nthe Secretary to complete a formal process that allows for public involvement. 43 U.S.C § 1712. \nThe Wind Ban violates FLPMA because FLPMA and its implementing regulations provide a \ndefined process for amending land use plans that neither the President nor BLM has followed.   \n219.  The Wind Ban violates FLPMA also because it unlawfully withdraws all lands \ngoverned by FLPMA from wind energy development. The Wind Ban falls within the definition \nof “withdrawal” under FLPMA. See 43 U.S.C. § 1702(j). The Wind Ban’s withdrawal of public \nlands violates FLPMA because withdrawal decisions are made by DOI, not by the President, and \nbecause neither the President nor BLM has complied with the procedural requirements of the Act \nin withdrawing Federal land from wind energy development. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1714 and 1739(e). \n220.  The Wind Ban is ultra vires under the CWA and RHA. 33 U.S.C. § 1344; RHA \n§§ 10, 14. Section 404 and the RHA do not grant the President authority to order the Corps to \ncease permitting and authorizations for wind energy and instead assign responsibility for \npermitting to the Corps, subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.  \n221.  The Wind Ban contravenes the CWA’s requirements that the Secretary “minimize \ndelays in the issuance of permits” to the maximum extent practicable. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(q) and  \n“assure that, to the maximum extent practicable” a decision will be reached on a permit \napplication “not later than the ninetieth day after the date the notice for such application is \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 59 of 63\n \npublished.” Id. RHA Sections 10 and 14 likewise do not grant the President or agencies authority \nto cease all permitting for wind energy.   \n222.  The Wind Ban is unlawful because it orders the Corps to ignore this requirement \nto act on permit applications. It likewise unlawfully orders EPA to ignore mandatory \nrequirements under the CWA. 33 U.S.C. § 1342; 40 C.F.R. parts 122, 124. \n223.  The Wind Ban is ultra vires also under the ESA, BGEPA, and MMPA.  \n224.  The President, NMFS, and USFWS lack authority to unilaterally cease \nconsultation and incidental take authorization for all wind projects. The ESA provides that “if the \nSecretary, after opportunity for public comment, with respect to a permit application” makes \ncertain findings, “the Secretary shall issue the [incidental take] permit.” 16 U.S.C. \n§ 1539(a)(2)(B); see also 16 U.S.C. § 1371(5)(A)(i) (MMPA). The Wind Ban is unlawful \nbecause it orders the agencies to ignore requirements under the ESA, BGEPA, and MMPA. \n225.  The Wind Ban is ultra vires under the CAA. The CAA directs EPA to “establish \nrequirements to control air pollution from Outer Continental Shelf sources” 42 U.S.C. § 7627. \nThe Wind Ban is unlawful because EPA does not have authority to unilaterally override these \nrequirements. \nCOUNT VI \nOCSLA Citizen Suit \n43 U.S.C. § 1349 \n \n226.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs 1-225 as if set forth \nfully herein.  \n227.  OCSLA’s citizen suit provision provides that “any person having a valid legal \ninterest which is or may be adversely affected may commence a civil action on his own behalf to \ncompel compliance with this subchapter against any person, including the United States, and any \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 60 of 63\n \nother government instrumentality or agency (to the extent permitted by the Eleventh Amendment \nto the Constitution) for any alleged violation of any provision of this subchapter or any \nregulation promulgated under this subchapter or of the terms of any permit or lease issued by the \nSecretary under this subchapter.” 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a)(1). And “[a]n action may be brought under \nthis subsection immediately after notification of the alleged violation in any case in which the \nalleged violation constitutes an imminent threat to the public health or safety or would \nimmediately affect a legal interest of the plaintiff.” 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a)(3). \n228.  Implementation of the Wind Ban by the United States and Defendant agencies \nviolates OCSLA and its regulations by attempting to circumvent the comprehensive procedures \ngoverning the administration of the OCS permitting and leasing program. 43 U.S.C. § 1337; 30 \nC.F.R. part 585. OCSLA confers no authority on the President and agencies to unilaterally cease \nwind permitting and, consequently, the Wind Ban doing so has no basis in law.  \n229.  Plaintiff’s and its members’ injuries are within the zone of interests protected by \nOCSLA. The violations by the United States and Defendant agencies immediately affect \nPlaintiff’s and its members’ legal interests by denying Plaintiff’s members’ ability to advance \ndevelopment of offshore wind energy on tracts leased to them.  \n230.  The actions by the United States and Defendant agencies immediately affect a \nlegal interest of Plaintiff and its members by causing the immediate and ongoing harm set forth \nin this complaint.  \n231.  Under OCSLA’s citizen suit provision, Plaintiff is entitled to vacatur of the Wind \nBan and related agency actions, a preliminary and permanent injunction barring Defendant \nagencies from taking further actions based in whole or in part on the Wind Ban, and the costs of \nthis litigation, “including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees.” 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a)(5). \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 114     Filed 05/21/25     Page 61 of 63\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \n1.  Declare that Defendant agencies’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Ban \nare arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; \n2.  Declare that Defendant agency adoption and implementation of the Wind Ban are \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right and \notherwise not in accordance with law in violation of the APA; \n3.  Declare that Defendant agencies failed to observe procedure required by law \nwhen adopting and implementing the Wind Ban by not undergoing public notice and comment \nrulemaking in violation of the APA; \n4.  Declare that the Presidential Memorandum directing the Wind Ban and actions by \nthe United States and its agencies to adopt and implement the Wind Ban are ultra vires under \napplicable statutes and the U.S. Constitution and violate the separation of powers; \n5.

No. 1:25-cv-11221-WGY \nDONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as    \nPresident of the United States, et al.,    \n \n  \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nDefendants. \nFOR DECLARATORY AND \n  \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n \n  \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Plaintiffs New York, Massachusetts, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nDelaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, \nNew Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington (States) bring this action to challenge \nPresident Trump’s unlawful Presidential Memorandum halting federal approvals of wind-energy \ndevelopment and to enjoin federal agencies’ implementation of that Memorandum. \n2.  On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum that, \ninter alia, categorically and indefinitely halted all federal approvals necessary for the development \nof offshore- and onshore-wind energy, pending an amorphous, redundant, extra-statutory, and \nmulti-agency review of unknown duration. Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer \nContinental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing \nand Permitting Practices for Wind Projects, 90 Fed. Reg. 8363 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Wind Memo). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 2 of 108\n   \n \nAlthough the States do not concede the legality of any aspect of the Wind Memo, this case \nchallenges Section 2(a)’s halt on federal approvals for wind-energy projects (the Wind Directive). \n3.  Citing unspecified “legal deficiencies” and “inadequacies” in past federal wind-\nenergy reviews, the Wind Directive orders the heads of relevant federal agencies to relinquish their \ncongressionally-imposed responsibilities. It orders that Agency Defendants instead “shall not issue \nnew or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore-wind \nprojects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind \nleasing and permitting practices”—a review, grounded in no statute and duplicative of already \nrequired reviews, that is to be conducted by the Secretary of the Interior with six separate federal \nagencies. Id. at 8364. \n4.  The Wind Directive has stopped most wind-energy development in its tracks, \ndespite the fact that wind energy is a homegrown source of reliable, affordable energy that supports \nhundreds of thousands of jobs, creates billions of dollars in economic activity and tax payments, \nand supplies more than 10% of the country’s electricity.  \n5.  And the Wind Directive was issued the very same day President Trump declared a \n“National Energy Emergency,” purportedly brought on by the country’s alleged “insufficient \nenergy production,” to shore up the “inadequate energy supply” by facilitating the development of \n“a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy.” Exec. Order 14156, Declaring a National \nEnergy Emergency, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Energy Emergency Order); see also Exec. \nOrder 14154, Unleashing American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Unleashing Order) \n(“encourag[ing] energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States \nas a global energy leader long into the future”). These and numerous other executive actions \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 3 of 108\n   \n \nsimilarly encouraged domestic energy development—that is, all but wind and other renewable \nenergy—and also directed agencies to shortcut environmental reviews for other forms of energy—\nthe very same reviews the Wind Directive labels as inadequate as to wind energy.  \n6.  Since issuance of the Wind Directive, Agency Defendants have duly ceased all \nwind-energy project permitting and approval activities, and have even issued a stop-work order \ninvoking the Wind Directive to halt construction of an offshore wind project that previously had \nreceived all federal permits required for construction. \n7.  The wind-energy industry, like many other capital-intensive industries in and \nbeyond  the  energy  sector,  operates  in  a  tremendously  complex  logistical  and  regulatory \nenvironment, where even minor setbacks can dramatically increase costs and delay or even \naltogether derail wind-energy projects. Accordingly, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ \nactions implementing it create an existential threat to the wind industry. \n8.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on \nfederal  wind-energy  approvals  harms  the  States’  efforts  to  secure  reliable,  diversified,  and \naffordable sources of energy to meet the ever-increasing demand for electricity; their billions of \ndollars  in  investments  in  supply  chains,  workforce  development,  and  wind-industry-related \ninfrastructure, including transmission upgrades; and their statutory- and policy-based efforts to \nprotect public health and welfare from harmful air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulfur \ndioxide, as well as greenhouse-gas emissions.  \n9.  The various actions taken by Agency Defendants to implement the Wind Directive \nare arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). First, the Wind \nDirective was issued with no reasoned explanation for its categorical and indefinite halt of wind-\nenergy development. Second, neither the Wind Directive nor Agency Defendants have offered any \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 4 of 108\n   \n \ndetailed justification to explain the abrupt change in longstanding federal policy supporting the \ndevelopment of wind energy.  Indeed, one Agency Defendant had recently described wind energy \nas “a critical source of power generation, reliability, and decarbonization.” Jonah Ury et al., \nPathways  to  Commercial  Liftoff: Offshore Wind,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Energy,  at  11  (Apr.  2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A4KL-6Z3W. Nor have Agency Defendants provided any explanation for their \ndeparture—using the President’s newly-imposed, extra-statutory review requirement—from past \nfindings, based on numerous comprehensive assessments, that wind projects can proceed with \nminimal or mitigable adverse effects on the environment and other interests. Third, the Wind \nDirective and Agency Defendants took no account of the serious reliance interests the States have \ndeveloped as a result of the federal government’s long-running support for and approvals of wind-\nenergy development and its issuance of leases for offshore-wind generation facilities, which \ncontinued even during the first Trump administration. Finally, the Wind Directive not only was \ninternally inconsistent—proclaiming that the United States must provide “reliable,” “afford[able]” \nenergy to its residents as it hobbles a growing source of that energy, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363—but \nalso contradicted, without explanation, President Trump’s aforementioned Energy Emergency \nOrder  and  other  contemporaneous  executive  actions  calling  for  increased  domestic  energy \nproduction and curtailed environmental review. \n10.  Agency Defendants’ implementation of the Wind Directive is also contrary to and \nin excess of statutory authority under numerous federal statutes including the Clean Air Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), among others, \nwhich demand comprehensive, and prompt, permitting and approval proceedings.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 5 of 108\n   \n \n11.  Further, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ actions implementing it are \nultra vires because no act of Congress authorizes the President or federal agencies to categorically \nand indefinitely halt approvals of wind-energy projects pending an extra-statutory review process. \n12.  If the Agency Defendants’ decision to implement the Wind Directive is vacated, \nwind-energy projects will continue toward development and obtain approval decisions in due \ncourse under applicable law, restoring certainty to the industry that enables projects to proceed and \nobtain financing and thereby mitigating the imminent and substantial risk of harms to the States’ \nsovereign and financial interests. Because the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ halt on \nwind-energy approvals are unlawful and jeopardize the continued development of a power source \ncritical to the States’ economic vitality, energy mix, public health, and climate goals, the States ask \nthis Court to declare the Wind Directive unlawful and vacate Agency Defendants’ decision to \nimplement it to halt development of wind-energy projects. \nPARTIES \n13.

The \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts is a resident of this district, and a substantial part of the events \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 11 of 108\n   \n \nor omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred and continues to occur within the District of \nMassachusetts. \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n56.  Numerous statutes and their implementing regulations require Agency Defendants \nto consider and issue decisions on applications for wind-energy project approvals.  \n57.  These statutes include but are not limited to OCSLA, the Clean Water Act, the \nRivers and Harbors Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the \nEndangered  Species Act,  the  Bald  and  Golden  Eagle  Protection Act,  the  Marine  Mammal \nProtection Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the National \nHistoric Preservation Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), and the Fixing \nAmerica’s Surface Transportation Act. \n58.  Under these authorities, Agency Defendants must comprehensively, but promptly, \nreview, approve, deny, or otherwise act on applications to construct and operate wind-energy \nfacilities, following specific procedures and standards.  \nA.  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \n59.  OCSLA states that the Outer Continental Shelf is “a vital national resource reserve \nheld by the Federal Government for the public.” 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3). OCSLA directs DOI to \nfacilitate the Outer Continental Shelf’s “expeditious and orderly development” while maintaining \ncompetition and environmental safeguards. Id. \n60.  OCSLA allows the Interior Secretary to “grant a lease, easement, or right-of-way” \nfor activities that “produce or support production, transportation, storage, or transmission of energy \nfrom sources other than oil and gas,” including offshore wind. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1337(p)(1)(C), 1356c.  \n61.  Once BOEM sells a commercial lease, a lessee must submit to BOEM a Site \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 12 of 108\n   \n \nAssessment Plan for site-assessment activities and a Construction and Operations Plan for facility \nconstruction activities. 30 C.F.R. § 585.600. BOEM must then process these documents by \nreviewing them and either approving, disapproving, or requesting revisions. See id. §§ 585.613; \n585.628; 585.648.  \n62.  OCSLA does not authorize agencies to cease permitting for issued wind leases. \nB.  The Clean Water Act  \n \n63.  Under  Section  404  of  the  Clean Water Act,  33  U.S.C.  §  1344,  wind-energy \ndevelopers must obtain a permit from the Corps before discharging dredge-and-fill material into \nwaters of the United States, id. §§ 1344(a), 1362(7). \n64.  When processing Section 404 permits, the Corps must issue public notice within \n15 calendar days of a complete application and issue a decision within 60 days unless additional \ninformation is needed. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(d). \n65.  Section 404 also mandates that the Corps minimize permitting delays, requiring \ndecisions on a dredge-and-fill permit application “to the maximum extent practicable . . . not later \nthan the ninetieth day after the date the notice for such application is published.” 33 U.S.C. \n§ 1344(q). \n66.  The  Corps’s  regulations  in  turn  prioritize  wind  and  other  energy  projects, \nclassifying them as a “major national objective” and giving the processing of their permit \napplications “high priority.” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(n). \n67.  The Clean Water Act also provides that any entity—including a wind-energy \ndeveloper—who plans to discharge pollutants from a point source into waters of the United States \nmust first obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. 33 U.S.C. \n§§ 1311, 1342.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 13 of 108\n   \n \n68.  Once it receives a NPDES permit application, EPA or a state agency with delegated \nNPDES permitting authority must determine within 30 days whether the application is complete \nand thereafter prepare a draft permit and solicit public comment before issuing a final permit. \n40 C.F.R. §§ 124.3(c); 124.10(a); 124.11–124.12. \nC.  The Rivers and Harbors Act  \n \n69.  Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 bars construction, excavation, or \nmodification of waterways unless authorized by the Corps through permits issued under Section 10 \nof the Act. 33 U.S.C. § 403; 33 C.F.R. § 320.2(b). \n70.  Under OCSLA, Section 10 permits (either individual or nationwide) are required \nfor “devices” and associated infrastructure such as offshore-wind turbines and cables. 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1333(e); see also id. § 1333(a)(1)(A)(iii)–(iv). \n71.  For individual Section 10 permits, the Corps must, among other things, notify \napplicants of incomplete applications within 15 calendar days; issue public notice within 15 days \nof receipt of a complete application; and decide applications within 60 days, unless additional \ninformation is needed. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2. \n72.  For nationwide permits, if the Corps doesn’t respond to a complete pre-construction \nnotification within 45 days, the activity is automatically authorized by the nationwide permit. \nReissuance and Modification of Nationwide Permits, 86 Fed. Reg. 73,522 (Dec. 27, 2021). \n73.  The Corps’s regulations recognize that “energy conservation and development are \nmajor national objectives” and provide that “[d]istrict engineers will give high priority to the \nprocessing of permit actions involving energy projects.” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(n). \n   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 14 of 108\n   \n \nD.  The Clean Air Act \n74.  The  Clean Air Act  requires  EPA  to  establish  National Ambient Air  Quality \nStandards  (NAAQS)  and  classify  air-quality-control  regions  as  attainment  or  nonattainment \nregions based on NAAQS compliance. 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(1)(A)–(B). \n75.  New “major” sources of air pollution must obtain a Prevention of Significant \nDeterioration permit in attainment areas or a Nonattainment New Source Review permit in \nnonattainment areas before construction. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7475(a), 7502(c)(5). \n76.  For activities on the Outer Continental Shelf, such as offshore wind, Clean Air Act \nregulations require EPA to count emissions from certain associated vessels when determining if a \nsource is “major.” 40 C.F.R. § 55.2; see 42 U.S.C. § 7627. And the permit type for an offshore-\nwind facility depends on the nearest onshore area’s attainment status. 40 C.F.R. § 55.5.  \n77.  The Clean Air Act requires permitting authorities to issue permit decisions within \none year of receiving an application for a Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit and within \n18 months of receiving an application for a Nonattainment New Source Review permit. 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 7475(c), 7661b(c). \n78.  EPA regulations set additional timelines. See 40 C.F.R. § 71.5(a)(2). \nE.  The National Environmental Policy Act  \n79.  NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the effects of proposed major federal \nactions on the human environment. 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. \n80.  NEPA  requires  each  agency  to  draft  a  “detailed  statement”—called  an \nenvironmental  impact  statement—for  every  proposed  “major  Federal  action[]  significantly \naffecting the quality of the human environment” that analyzes the action’s reasonable foreseeable \nenvironmental effects, the effects that cannot be avoided, and a range of alternatives to the action, \namong other elements. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(i)–(iii).   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 15 of 108\n   \n \n81.  NEPA applies to most federal permitting requirements including Outer Continental \nShelf and federal land leasing; OCSLA Construction and Operations Plan (and sometimes Site \nAssessment Plan) approvals; Endangered Species Act incidental-take determinations; Clean Air \nAct approvals; and Clean Water Act approvals. \n82.  In 2023, Congress passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, amending NEPA to impose \nstrict  deadlines.  Now,  the  lead  agency  “shall  complete”  an  environmental  assessment  (the \nassessment required under NEPA to determine whether a project’s effects are so significant as to \nrequire preparation of a full environmental impact statement) not later than one year after certain \nconditions are met, and “shall complete” an environmental impact statement not later than two \nyears after those conditions are met. 42 U.S.C. § 4336a(g). Those deadlines can be extended only \nby “so much additional time as is necessary to complete such environmental impact statement or \nenvironmental assessment.” Id. \nF.  The Endangered Species Act  \n83.  Under the Endangered Species Act, each federal agency must “insure that any \naction authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued \nexistence” of any endangered or threatened species “or result in the destruction or adverse \nmodification of habitat” the Secretary of Interior determines to be critical. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2); \nsee Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 158 (1997). \n84.  Federal agencies must consult with USFWS or NMFS (collectively, Services), and \nthe relevant Service must issue a written biological opinion regarding how the activity—wind-\nenergy development, for example—will impact the listed species or critical habitat. 16 U.S.C. \n§ 1536(b)(3)(A). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 16 of 108\n   \n \n85.  Consultation must conclude promptly, “within 90 days after its initiation unless \nextended,” and the relevant Service must complete the biological opinion within 45 days thereafter. \n50 C.F.R. § 402.14(e). \n86.  If the relevant Service determines the activity will jeopardize a species’s ongoing \nexistence or destroy critical habitat, the biological opinion must include “reasonable and prudent \nalternatives” to avoid that consequence. Id. § 402.14(g)(5). \n87.  Alternately, if the Services find the action may only cause incidental impacts, the \nrelevant Service must issue an incidental-take statement that identifies the species impacts, \nincorporates  minimization  measures,  and  sets  forth  requirements  the  agency  must  follow. \n16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(4); see also Bennett, 520 U.S. at 158. \n88.  The Endangered Species Act also provides for incidental-take permits for otherwise \nunlawful takes without a federal nexus if the applicant for such a permit, like a wind-energy \ndeveloper, obtains an approved conservation plan. 16 U.S.C. § 1539(a)(1)(B). \n89.  Upon receipt of an incidental-take application, USFWS or NMFS follow specific \nnotice-and-comment procedures and issue the permit if the applicable requirements are met. Id. \n§ 1539(a)(2)(B); 50 C.F.R. Parts 13, 17, 222, 402. \n90.  USFWS must timely process complete applications and render permit decisions. \n50 C.F.R. § 17.22(b)(1)–(2). NMFS must process applications “in the shortest possible time” and \nissue permits unless specific findings bar approval. Id. §§ 222.302(b), 222.303(e). \nG.  The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act  \n91.  The Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act prohibits the take—i.e., harming, killing, \nor disturbing—of bald or golden eagles without a permit issued by USFWS. 16 U.S.C. § 668. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 17 of 108\n   \n \n92.  The Act allows USFWS to authorize a bald or golden eagle take for disturbance \n(either an incidental take or nest removal) if it is compatible with eagle preservation. Id. § 668a; \nsee 50 C.F.R. § 22.280. \n93.  USFWS must issue a general incidental-take permit for an activity, such as a wind-\nenergy project, if (1) the activity is necessary to protect a legitimate interest; (2) the take is not the \nactivity’s purpose; and (3) the take cannot practicably be avoided. 50 C.F.R. §§ 22.210(d), 22.250. \n94.  Wind-energy projects that are ineligible for a general permit may request a letter of \nauthorization to apply for a specific permit according to specific criteria. Id. § 22.200(b)(7).  \n95.  USFWS is to process all applications for Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act \npermits “as quickly as possible.” 50 C.F.R. § 13.11. \nH.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act \n96.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act generally prohibits the take of a marine \nmammal or any attempt to do so. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1371(a), 1362(13). \n97.  The Commerce and Interior Secretaries, however, can authorize the incidental take \nof  a  small  number  of  marine  mammals  from  commercial  activities,  such  as  wind-energy \ndevelopment. Id. § 1371(a)(5)(A).  \n98.  The Secretaries “shall allow” an incidental take if it will have a “negligible impact” \non the species and no “unmitigable adverse impact” on subsistence uses of the species. Id.  \n99.  If an incidental take is authorized, the relevant Secretary must then issue regulations \non permissible take methods and measures to minimize harm—especially to critical habitats—and \nset monitoring and reporting requirements. 16 U.S.C. § 1371(a)(5)(A).  \n100.  The Services are to process all applications for Marine Mammal Protection Act \npermits “as quickly as possible.” 50 C.F.R. § 13.11. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 18 of 108\n   \n \nI.  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n101.  The  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Act  requires \nfederal  agencies  to  consult  with  NMFS  “with respect  to  any  action  authorized,  funded,  or \nundertaken” or proposed “by such agency that may adversely affect any essential fish habitat” \nunder the Act. 16 U.S.C. § 1855(b)(2). \n102.  Implementing regulations require the lead agencies to provide NMFS “with a \nwritten  assessment  of  the  effects  of  that  action  on  [essential  fish  habitat].”  50  C.F.R. \n§ 600.920(e)(1).  \n103.  NMFS must respond to the lead agency within 30 days of receiving its essential-\nfish-habitat assessment. Id. § 600.920(h)(4). \nJ.  The National Historic Preservation Act \n104.  The National Historic Preservation Act requires the lead federal agency “having \ndirect or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed Federal or federally assisted undertaking in any \nState,” including license issuance, to “take into account the effect” that approving a proposed \nproject may have “on any historic property.” 54 U.S.C. § 306108. The Act gives the Advisory \nCouncil on Historic Preservation has opportunity to comment. Id.  \n105.  The Act can be triggered if a project may have an effect on either a listed or eligible \nhistoric property, which can include shipwrecks, historic buildings, and historic landmarks. \nK.  The Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n106.  FLPMA governs BLM and the Interior Secretary’s administration of onshore public \nlands. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq.  \n107.  The Act mandates that the Secretary develop, maintain, revise, and manage public \nlands in accordance with resource-management plans, 43 U.S.C §§ 1712(a), 1732(a); 43 C.F.R. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 19 of 108\n   \n \n§ 1610.5-3. In a resource-management plan, BLM, the Secretary’s FLPMA designee, can designate \nsections of public lands as open or closed for certain uses, including rights-of-way for the \nproduction of wind energy. 43 C.F.R. § 1610.1. \n108.  Specific procedures, like Federal Register and congressional notification, govern \nthe withdrawal  of future uses of land including rights  of way for wind-energy production. \n43 U.S.C. § 1714(a), (b)(1), (e).  \n109.  BLM may only deny a right-of-way application for specific reasons detailed in \nBLM regulations. 43 C.F.R. § 2804.26. And before suspending a right-of-way, holders of the right \nmust receive written notice and time to comply. 43 U.S.C. § 1766.  \nL.  The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act \n110.  The  Fixing  America’s  Surface  Transportation  Act  streamlines  environmental \nreview  and  permitting  for  covered  infrastructure  projects—including  wind-energy  projects. \n42 U.S.C. §§ 4370m et seq. \n111.  The Act requires the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council to maintain \nan online permitting dashboard following strict protocols to track federal environmental review \nand approval timelines. Id. § 4370m–2(b). \n112.  All federal agencies must adhere to permitting timelines. Id. § 4370m–2(c). If an \nagency anticipates missing or misses a deadline, it must notify the Council’s Executive Director, \npropose a new completion date, and submit status reports to the Executive Director until the agency \nhas taken final action on the delayed authorization or review. Id. \n   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 20 of 108\n   \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Federal  Agencies  Have  Long  Encouraged  and  Thoroughly  Assessed  the \nDevelopment of Wind Energy  \n \n113.  The development of both onshore- and offshore-wind energy has long enjoyed \nbipartisan support.  \n114.  President George W. Bush celebrated the fact that wind energy had increased by \nmore than 400% between 2001 and 2007.  \n115.  President Barack Obama oversaw a tripling of the amount of wind power generated \nin the United States, due in part to the $90 billion invested in renewable energy as part of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in 2009.  \n116.  President  Trump’s  first  administration  conducted  seven  offshore  wind  lease \nauctions,  granted  multiple  leases  to  offshore-wind  energy  developers,  and  moved  forward \nenvironmental reviews of proposed wind projects.  \n117.  President Joe Biden signed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which provided clean-\nenergy tax credits that are expected to help add, on average, 24 gigawatts of onshore wind energy \nper  year  by  2030. The  Biden  administration  pledged  that  the  United  States  would  deploy \n30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. By the time President Biden left office, Agency Defendants \nhad approved 15 gigawatts of offshore wind, and the industry had attracted billions in investment.  \n118.  Agency Defendants conducted extensive evaluation of wind-energy projects before \ngranting approvals under the statutory authorities described above.  \n119.  For example, NMFS studied the impacts of offshore wind on the North Atlantic \nright whale, as required under the Endangered Species Act. NMFS, North Atlantic Right Whale 5-\nYear Review: Summary and Evaluation, at 24–25 (Nov. 2022), https://perma.cc/62QZ-6XTE. Just \nlast year, USFWS studied the impacts of wind projects on eagles in connection with its revision of \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 21 of 108\n   \n \nthe rules governing incidental take. USFWS, Final Environmental Assessment, 2024 Eagle Take \nPermit Rulemaking, 170–82 (Feb. 2024), https://perma.cc/5W4T-HY77. Biological Opinions for \nindividual wind projects have incorporated numerous mitigation measures to protect marine life. \nNorth Atlantic Right Whale 5-Year Review, supra, at 24–25. And environmental impact statements \nfor existing projects have also extensively studied wildlife impacts. See, e.g., BOEM, Revolution \nWind Farm and Revolution Wind Cable Export Project Final Environmental Impact Statement, \n3.15-1–3.15-7,  E1-45–E1-80,  F-24–F-36,  F-55–F-67,  G-242–G-243  (2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/FS8W-4C55. \n120.  Agency Defendants have also already studied wind energy’s impacts on the fishing \nindustry and addressed in detail ways to mitigate those impacts. See, e.g., BOEM, Atlantic Shores \nOffshore  Wind  South  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  App.  G  at  14  (2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/5W6S-JH9P; BOEM, Record of Decision: Vineyard Wind 1 Offshore Wind Energy \nProject Construction and Operations Plan (Vineyard Wind ROD), at 42–43 (May 10, 2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/NL5V-DVDF. Agency Defendants’ findings have even shown that offshore wind \nmay benefit the fishing industry, including the artificial-reef effect from the turbine structures and \nthe discharge of fill material that could create new fish habitat. See BOEM, Record of Decision: \nAtlantic Shores Offshore Wind South Project Construction and Operations Plan (Atlantic Shores \nCOP ROD), at 22 (July 1, 2024), https://perma.cc/HQ7P-ZY56; Vineyard Wind ROD, supra, at \n36, 39. \n121.  Likewise, Agency Defendants have thoroughly reviewed the economic impacts of \nwind energy, both generally and with regard to specific projects. As a result of those reviews, \nAgency Defendants have concluded that already-permitted offshore-wind projects would have \nlittle or no impact on local tourism industries. See, e.g., BOEM, Record of Decision: Empire \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 22 of 108\n   \n \nOffshore Wind: Empire Wind Project (EW1 and EW2) Construction and Operations Plan, at 28 \n(Nov. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/JQE9-Q2AM. And Agency Defendants have also relied on \nmultiple studies concluding there is no evidence showing wind farms negatively impact property \nvalues. See, e.g., BOEM, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind South Final Environmental Impact \nStatement  Appendix  F  (Atlantic  Shores  FEIS  Appendix  F),  at  3.6.3-21  (2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/KS2Z-EUXB  (relying  on  these  studies  to  determine  the  project  will  have \nnegligible to minor impacts on property value). In fact, Agency Defendants have found that wind \nprojects will benefit the economy. See Atlantic Shores FEIS Appendix F, supra, at 3.6.3-26; id. at \n3.6.3-16 (noting study finding that “every $1.00 spent building an offshore-wind farm is estimated \nto generate $1.83 for New Jersey’s economy”); id. at 3.6.3-18 (wind development supports port \nemployment and surrounding businesses, especially during construction); BOEM, Record of \nDecision: Revolution Wind Farm and Revolution Wind Export Cable Project Construction and \nOperations Plan, at 16 (Aug. 21, 2023) (preferred alternative expected to have beneficial economic \nimpacts), https://perma.cc/HZ36-WMSH.  \n122.  Multiple courts have determined that federal permitting agencies have fulfilled their \nstatutory obligations, and in these cases have not found any legal deficiencies or inadequacies in \nenvironmental review. See, e.g., Seafreeze Shoreside, Inc. v. DOI, 123 F.4th 1 (1st Cir. 2024); \nNantucket Residents Against Turbines v. BOEM, 100 F.4th 1 (1st Cir. 2024), cert. denied sub nom. \nNantucket Residents v. BOEM, No. 24-337, 2025 WL 76449 (U.S. Jan. 13, 2025); Comm. for a \nConstructive Tomorrow v. DOI, No. CV 24-774 (LLA), 2024 WL 2699895 (D.D.C. May 24, 2024); \nPub. Emps. for Env’t Resp. v. Beaudreau, 25 F. Supp. 3d 67 (D.D.C. 2014). \n123.  Agency Defendants have also comprehensively reviewed onshore-wind-energy \nprojects. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 23 of 108\n   \n \n124.  As one example, BLM issued a programmatic environmental-impact statement \nregarding the impacts of wind-energy development on roughly 20 million acres of public lands in \n11 western states, including several of the State parties to this complaint. BLM concluded that \n“[e]ffective mitigation measures could be implemented to address many of the direct and indirect \nadverse impacts that could occur” and that “[t]he potential impacts of wind-energy development \non  local  and  regional  economies  would  be  largely  beneficial.”  BLM,  Final  Programmatic \nEnvironmental Impact Statement on Wind Energy Deployment on BLM-Administered Lands in the \nWestern United States, at ES-5 (June 2005), https://perma.cc/L9D9-E26Z. \n125.  BLM  also  determined  that  granting  rights-of-way  for  wind-energy  projects \n“contributes to the public interest in developing renewable energy to meet Federal and state goals.” \nBLM,  ROD  Tule  Wind  Project  Decision  to  Grant  Right-of-Way,  at  2  (Dec.  2011), \nhttps://perma.cc/J56V-2T6Q. BLM has found that project terms and conditions “will ensure” that \nonshore-wind-energy  projects  “will  protect  environmental  resources  and  comply  with \nenvironmental standards.” Id. \n126.  Courts also have upheld these environmental reviews and analyses of onshore-wind \nprojects. See, e.g., Protect our Cmtys. Found. v. Salazar, No. 12CV2211-GPC PCL, 2013 WL \n5947137 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2013), aff’d sub nom. Backcountry Against Dumps v. Jewell, 674 F. \nApp’x 657 (9th Cir. 2017); Protect Our Cmtys. Found. v. Jewell, 825 F.3d 571 (9th Cir. 2016). \nB.  President  Trump  and  Agency  Defendants  Reversed  Longstanding  Policy  by \nHalting Wind-Energy Development Despite Promoting Other Domestic Energy \nProduction \n \n127.  President  Trump  issued  the  Wind  Memo—including  the  Wind  Directive’s \ncategorical and indefinite halt on wind-energy approvals—on January 20, 2025. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 24 of 108\n   \n \n128.  The Wind Directive reverses the robust federal support for wind energy that had \nspanned decades and multiple administrations, does not account for Agency Defendants’  extensive \npast  federal  review of  wind  development,  and  conflicts  with  President Trump  and Agency \nDefendants’ concurrent promotion of domestic energy production, both as a general matter and \nspecifically in several of our States. \n129.  In Section 1, despite citing “the country’s growing demand for reliable energy,” the \nWind Directive indefinitely prohibits new wind-energy leasing but assures that it does not affect \n“rights under existing leases.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363. \n130.  Section 2(a) of the Wind Memo—the Wind Directive at issue in this case—\nprohibits Agency Defendants from issuing “new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, \nleases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects” until “the completion of a comprehensive \nassessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices.” Id. at 8364. \n131.  The Wind Directive orders that halt “[i]n light of various alleged legal deficiencies \nunderlying the Federal Government's leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects, \nthe consequences of which may lead to grave harm—including negative impacts on navigational \nsafety interests, transportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and \nmarine mammals,” as well as alleged “potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews” \nunder NEPA. Id. \n132.  The Secretary of the Interior must conduct the new extra-statutory assessment, the \nWind Directive commands, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of \nAgriculture,  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  through  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric \nAdministration, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Id. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 25 of 108\n   \n \n133.  And  despite  the  extensive  past  reviews  of  wind-energy  projects  by Agency \nDefendants—indeed, ignoring the existence of these  reviews—the Directive orders  that the \nassessment consider anew “the environmental impact of onshore and offshore-wind projects upon \nwildlife” and the “economic costs associated with the intermittent generation of electricity.” Id.  \n134.  The Wind Directive provides no time frame for completion of that open-ended \nassessment.  \n135.  Section 2(c) also requires the Interior Secretary to report to the President on “the \nenvironmental impact and cost to surrounding communities of defunct and idle windmills.” Id.  \n136.  The Wind Directive also conflicts with Defendants’ simultaneous promotion of \ndomestic energy production in various Executive Orders and other actions.  \n137.  For example, President Trump issued the Wind Directive indefinitely stalling wind-\nenergy approvals within hours of issuing two executive orders that emphasized the need for \ndomestic energy production and ordered agencies to expedite and curtail environmental reviews \nfor other forms of energy. \n138.  In the Energy Emergency Order, President Trump declared a “national emergency” \nallegedly brought on by “insufficient energy production” constituting an allegedly “extraordinary \nthreat to our Nation’s economy, national security, and foreign policy.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8434. The \nEnergy Emergency Order announced measures purporting to encourage the development of “a \nreliable,  diversified,  and  affordable  supply  of  energy,”  but  excluded  wind  energy  from  its \ndefinitions. Id. at 8433. The announced measures specifically included “identify[ing] obstacles to \ndomestic energy infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA or the Marine \nMammal Protection Act” and developing “procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements” \n(while the Wind Directive simultaneously invokes claimed inadequacies of reviews and approvals \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 26 of 108\n   \n \nunder such authorities to altogether halt wind-energy development). Id. at 8436. The Order also \nsingled out Northeastern and West Coast states for allegedly causing a deficient U.S. energy supply \nand further directed agencies to “use all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to \nfacilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy” in these states. Id. at 8434. \n139.  The Day 1 Unleashing Order similarly proclaimed that it is “the policy of the United \nStates” to “encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including \non the Outer Continental Shelf.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8353. Like the Energy Emergency Order, this \norder excluded wind as a source of energy to be expanded. Id. at 8354. \n140.  More recently, President Trump issued multiple executive orders bolstering the coal \nindustry, claiming that, “in order to ensure adequate and reliable electric generation in America, to \nmeet growing electricity demand, and to address the national emergency declared pursuant to [the \nEnergy  Emergency  Order],  our  electric  grid  must  utilize  all  available  power  generation \nresources.” Exec.

These and other Executive Orders and actions between January 20, 2025, and the \npresent emphasized the need for expedited domestic energy development—but not wind energy—\nand ordered agencies to altogether skip or otherwise curtail the very environmental reviews that \nthe Wind Directive invokes to block wind energy. See, e.g., Exec. Order 14270, Zero-Based \nRegulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,643 (Apr. 15, 2025) (Zero-\nBased Budgeting Order) (ordering agencies to sunset regulations governing environmental reviews \nthat impact energy development); see also Exec.

Agency Defendants took the commands to heart; indeed, Defendant \nDOI recently announced expedited permitting for nearly all forms of domestic energy production \nexcept wind energy. See DOI, Press Release: Department of the Interior Implements Emergency \nPermitting Procedures to Strengthen Domestic Energy Supply. \n   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 28 of 108\n   \n \nC.  Agency Defendants Have Adopted the Wind Directive’s Indefinite and Categorical \nHalt on Wind-Energy Approvals \n \n142.  Since January 20, 2025, Agency Defendants have adopted and implemented the \nWind Directive to indefinitely and categorically halt wind-energy approvals.  \n143.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Agency  Defendants  have  ceased  all  pending \napprovals necessary for construction of wind-energy projects. \n144.  The implications for individual projects and the States have become increasingly \nclear over the past several months, resulting in irreparable and mounting harms to the States.  \n145.  For example, on January 20, 2025, the same day the Wind Directive was issued, \nActing  Secretary  of  the  Interior  Walter  Cruickshank  suspended  delegations  of  authority  to \n“Department  Bureaus  and  Offices”  to  “issue  any  onshore  or  offshore  renewable  energy \nauthorization, including but not limited to a lease, amendment to a lease, right of way, amendment \nto a right of way, contract, or any other agreement required to allow for renewable energy \ndevelopment.”  Walter  Cruickshank,  Order  No.  3415,  Temporary  Suspension  of  Delegated \nAuthority (Jan. 20, 2025), https://perma.cc/N4X8-8JQF. DOI revised this secretarial order on \nJanuary 29, restoring all but five of the delegations of authority, but the suspension of delegation \nof authority for offshore renewable-energy development remained in place during the effective \nperiod of that Secretarial Order.  \n146.  The next day, a NOAA representative informed an offshore-wind developer that its \nMarine Mammal Protection Act incidental-take authorization was subject to the Wind Directive’s \npause. NOAA indicated the pause to any new permits for this developer’s project would last \n90 days. NOAA indicated the need for a 90-day delay to issue the developer’s permit as a result of \nthe Wind Directive. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 29 of 108\n   \n \n147.  Just three days later, on January 24, the USFWS website provided the following \nnotice to eagle incidental-take permit applicants:  \nThe  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  pursuant  to  Presidential  Memorandum \n‘Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore \nWind Leading and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting \nPractices for Wind Projects’ is temporarily ceasing issuance of permits to wind \nfacilities until further notice.  \n \nUSFWS,  3-200-71:  Eagle  Incidental  Take  (General  Permit),  https://perma.cc/HC9J-\nUMND. \n148.  On January 28, BOEM postponed virtual public meetings on its draft Programmatic \nEnvironmental Impact Statement for Potential Mitigation of Future Development of Wind Lease \nAreas Offshore California, stating in the postponement notice posted on its website that: \nThe Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are \nimplementing the Administration’s Presidential Memorandum (PM) temporarily \nhalting offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf.

On January 30, FAST-41 dashboards that track the progress of wind projects in \ncompleting environmental review and permit processes reflected sudden permitting delays. Just \nthree days earlier, on January 27, the FAST-41 dashboard for the SouthCoast Wind Energy LLC \n(SouthCoast) project in Massachusetts indicated it had completed seven out of ten environmental \nreview and permitting processes, and review and permitting were estimated to be completed by \nMarch 27, 2025. On January 30, the dashboard indicated that the same number of environmental \nreview and permitting processes were completed, but the estimated completion date was pushed \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 30 of 108\n   \n \nback  to  June  26,  2025.

On February 4, BOEM announced that, due to President Trump’s Wind Directive, \nit was canceling the virtual public meetings BOEM had scheduled in February to take up its Notice \nof Intent to prepare an environmental-impact statement for a Construction and Operations Plan \nsubmitted by Vineyard Mid-Atlantic LLC. BOEM, Virtual Meetings Cancelled for Vineyard Mid-\nAtlantic Offshore Wind Project (Feb. 4, 2025), https://perma.cc/N449-GUWA.  \n151.  Soon  thereafter  BOEM  posted  the  following  notice  on  the  webpage  for  the \nVineyard Mid-Atlantic project:  \nThe Department of the Interior and BOEM are implementing President Trump’s \nmemorandum temporarily halting offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental \nShelf. The memorandum also pauses new or renewed approvals, rights of way, \npermits, leases, or loans for offshore wind projects pending a review of federal wind \nleasing and permitting practices. . . . As a result, the February virtual public \nmeetings on BOEM’s NOI to prepare an EIS for the proposed Vineyard Mid-\nAtlantic Project have been cancelled.  \n \nId. \n152.  On February 5, the Corps paused permitting for 168 renewable energy projects. The \nCorps lifted the halt a few days later—but not for wind projects. The Corps has even implemented \nthe Directive to halt Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act permitting for projects intended \nto support the wind-energy industry, such as the Arthur Kill Terminal wind component staging and \nassembly project in Staten Island, NY, as discussed below.  \n153.  On February 26, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council granted \nBOEM’s  request  to  extend  the  final  completion  date  for  a  NPDES  permit  decision  under \nSection 402 of the Clean Water Act for the SouthCoast project in Massachusetts.

BOEM  sought  this \nextension on behalf of EPA, claiming “EPA needs additional time to evaluate the applicability of \n[the Wind Directive] to issuance of the final NPDES permit decision.” Id. The NPDES permit \ncompletion date was moved from March 27 to June 25, 2025. Id.  On May 23, 2025, the completion \ndate was again pushed back, this time to September 23, 2025, citing only the Wind Directive. \nPermitting Dashboard, SouthCoast Wind Energy, LLC, https://tinyurl.com/3knbk2zy.   \n154.  On  February  28,  despite  full  merits  briefing,  EPA  Region  2  filed  a  motion \nrequesting that the Environmental Appeals Board remand Atlantic Shores Offshore-Wind Project \n1’s Clean Air Act permit back to the Region for reevaluation. The motion cited the Wind Directive \nas its basis. In re Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, LLC, OCS Appeal No. 24-01 (Mar. 3, 2025). On \nMarch 14, the Environmental Appeals Board granted EPA’s request. In re Atlantic Shores Offshore \nWind, LLC, OCS Appeal No. 24-01 (Mar. 14, 2025). \n155.  On April 16, the Interior Secretary issued a memorandum instructing BOEM to \norder that the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York indefinitely “cease all construction \nactivities.” Memorandum from Doug Burgum, DOI, to Acting Dir., BOEM (Apr. 16, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/93NP-8B5Y. As explanation for its order, the memorandum stated only that, \npursuant to the review ordered in the Wind Directive, DOI had “obtained information that raises \nserious issues with respect to the project approvals.” Id. The memorandum also ordered BOEM \n“to continue [its] review of Federal wind permitting practices with respect to both existing and \npending permits.” Id.  \n156.  Within  hours,  BOEM  issued  a  stop  work  order  for  Empire  Wind,  effective \nimmediately, “to allow time for [BOEM] to address feedback it has received, including from . . . \nNOAA, about the environmental analyses for that project.” Letter from Walter Cruickshank, \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 32 of 108\n   \n \nBOEM, to Empire Offshore Wind LLC (Apr. 16, 2025), https://perma.cc/EV6D-TKSK. This \nfeedback, the acting director wrote, was an “outgrowth” of the review DOI is undertaking pursuant \nto the Wind Directive. Id. The acting director’s order warned that activities related to Empire Wind \nmay not resume until “BOEM has completed its necessary review.” Id. \n157.  To  date, Agency  Defendants  have  offered  no  explanation  for  the  delays  and \ndisruptions to wind-energy permitting and development other citing the Wind Directive.  \n158.  Furthermore, at no point did any Agency Defendant provide a reasoned explanation \nfor its sharp reversal of federal policy or decisions regarding wind-energy development. \nD.  States Are Relying on Continued Wind Energy Development and Deployment to \nProvide Reliable and Affordable Energy while Promoting Economic Growth, \nReaching Their Climate Goals, and Protecting the Health and Welfare of Their \nResidents \n159.  Wind power provides over 10% of the country’s renewable energy, making it the \nlargest source of renewable energy in the United States. Its continued development is critical to \nmeet the increasing demand for reliable and affordable energy in the States’ jurisdictions while \ncreating well-paying jobs, advancing energy diversity, reaching their climate goals, and protecting \nthe health and welfare of their residents. \n160.  The United States is projected to see a 16% increase in electricity demand by 2029.  \n161.  According to the Department of Energy, “wind turbines provide one of the lowest-\npriced energy sources available today.” U.S. Dep’t of Energy, Advantages and Challenges of Wind \nEnergy, https://perma.cc/XGJ2-PFH4. Wind power will be necessary to meet the increasing \ndemand for reliable and affordable electricity. \n162.  Given  its  promise,  wind  energy  has  already  attracted  billions  of  dollars  of \ninvestment—much of which has come from the States themselves. In 2022 alone, the federal \ngovernment estimated that wind projects added $20 billion to the U.S. economy. Id. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 33 of 108\n   \n \n163.  These  investments,  among  other  things,  have  created  and  continue  to  create \nthousands of well-paying jobs in the States. The industry directly employs 131,000 Americans, \nand also supports over 300,000 jobs, such as wind turbine technicians and blade fabricators. Wind-\nturbine technicians are projected to be the fastest-growing job in the country.  \n164.  Energy produced from offshore and onshore wind energy provides a source of \nreliable electricity to our States. With developments in battery storage technology, wind energy \nhas been increasingly paired with battery storage systems that efficiently store surplus electricity \ngenerated during peak wind periods for future use.    \n165.  Wind generation not only provides reliable and affordable energy and creates \neconomic opportunity in the States, but also is critical to States’ ability to mitigate harms from \nclimate change. The States are counting on continued growth in the wind industry to decarbonize \ntheir electricity generation to meet state greenhouse-gas emission-reduction goals and mitigate the \nimpacts of climate change. \n166.  Wind energy also produces major health benefits for our residents. Specifically, \nwind power reduces the impact of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide \nassociated with fossil-fueled energy resources. These reductions in turn reduce adverse health \nimpacts, including asthma, bronchitis, lower- and upper-respiratory symptoms, and heart attacks. \nU.S.  Dep’t  of  Energy,  How  Wind  Can  Help  Us  Breathe  Easier  (Aug.  21,  2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A9NZ-GLHW. For example, one study found that in 2014 alone, improvements \nin air quality associated with wind power resulted in $2 billion in health benefits in the United \nStates.  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  A  healthy  wind  (Dec.  2,  2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/9UKT-QUZF.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 34 of 108\n   \n \n167.  All these benefits are at risk now because the Agency Defendants’ implementation \nof the Wind Directive is threatening the wind industry in the States. In April 2024, the Department \nof Energy warned that offshore wind was “at an inflection point”—that “[f]ailure to build projects \ntoday would risk delaying cost reductions and extending risk exposure to the longer-term project \npipeline, freezing investments, and pushing an industry with both short-term and long-term \ndecarbonization momentum into dormancy.” Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Offshore Wind, \nsupra, at 16. \n168.  In other words, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation of it \nrisk depriving States of energy reliability and affordability benefits, economic activity, health \nbenefits, and environmental protection that were to come from their substantial investments in \nwind power. The deleterious effects the Wind Directive and its implementation are having on the \nStates are detailed below.  \nNew York \n169.  New York is developing both offshore and onshore wind energy to serve its growing \nelectricity load and to reduce harmful emissions. The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ \ncategorical and indefinite halt on project approvals threaten New York’s ability to pursue those \ngoals and, more specifically, the State’s progress toward its wind-specific statutory-procurement \nand greenhouse-gas emission targets.  \n170.  New York’s 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate \nAct), which sets forth statutory targets for greenhouse-gas reductions on an economywide basis \nand specific capacity targets for offshore wind, is designed to work alongside other state efforts to \nreduce the financial impacts of climate change and increase the quality of life for New Yorkers.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 35 of 108\n   \n \n171.  The Climate Act establishes greenhouse-gas emission-reduction targets of 40% by \n2030 and 85% by 2050, both from 1990 levels, with a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It also \nincludes a target that New York have a 100% emissions-free electricity sector by 2040 and be \npowered by 70% renewable energy by 2030. The Climate Act also specifically sets forth a \ndevelopment target of 9,000 megawatts of offshore-wind energy by 2035. \n172.  The Public Service Commission incorporated the Climate Act’s targets of 70% \nrenewable energy and 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind energy into New York’s Clean Energy \nStandard,  under  which  the  New  York  State  Energy  Research  and  Development Authority \n(NYSERDA) issues regular procurements to purchase renewable energy certificates from new \nclean energy generation projects. Those renewable energy certificates are sold to load-serving \nentities and offered for sale to the voluntary market, reducing costs of the program to ratepayers. \n173.  Onshore- and offshore-wind projects are expected to play increasingly significant \nroles as the State pursues a zero-emissions electricity system consistent with the Climate Act’s \nobjectives. The Climate Act Scoping Plan, which provides comprehensive recommendations for \nreducing greenhouse-gas emissions and achieving net-zero emissions, forecasts that to achieve a \nfully decarbonized grid, New York will need to deploy approximately 14,600 megawatts of \nonshore wind and 14,900 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040.  \n174.  New York has three offshore-wind projects in advanced stages, one of which has \nbeen fully constructed, and the second and third of which have been under construction.  \n175.  The  132-megawatt  South  Fork  Wind  project  is  New York’s  first  operational \noffshore wind farm, consisting of 12 turbines. It is located within federal waters on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, approximately 35 miles east of Montauk. The project delivered energy from its \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 36 of 108\n   \n \nfirst turbine to the local Long Island electric grid beginning in December 2023 and became fully \noperational in 2024.  \n176.  Among New York’s offshore wind projects currently under construction is a 924-\nmegawatt offshore wind farm located roughly 30 miles off the coast of Montauk Point, in federal \nwaters on the Outer Continental Shelf. It is expected to power nearly 600,000 New York homes \nwith commercial operations planned to begin in 2027. Onshore construction in New York State is \nsubstantially progressed, pursuant to state and local permits and approvals, with the onshore \nconverter station nearing completion. Offshore construction is also underway, having begun in the \nfirst quarter of 2025, and will follow a carefully sequenced schedule. The project has employed \nand is currently employing thousands of people in New York and across the country, and has a \nsupply chain spanning dozens of states, including ships built in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and \nPennsylvania and major components produced in upstate New York and South Carolina.   \n177.  The other offshore wind project in advanced stages, Empire Wind, is an 80,000-\nacre wind project located in federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf, 15–30 miles southeast \nof Long Island. The project includes development of the lease area in two wind farms, known as \nEmpire Wind 1 and Empire Wind 2. The developer projects that Empire Wind 1 will produce \n816 megawatts with 60–80 turbines, enough to power 500,000 homes. The project will be the first \noffshore-wind project to deliver power directly to New York City. BOEM approved the project’s \nConstruction and Operations Plan in February 2024. Construction on Empire Wind 1 began in June \n2024. The first power is expected to be delivered in late 2026, with the project fully operational in \n2027.  \n178.  On April 16, however, as noted above, the Acting Director of BOEM, at the request \nof the Interior Secretary, issued a stop work order for Empire Wind, effective immediately. Letter \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 37 of 108\n   \n \nfrom  Walter  Cruickshank,  BOEM  to  Empire  Offshore  Wind  LLC  (Apr.  16,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/EV6D-TKSK. That stop work order was lifted on May 19, 2025. Letter from \nWalter  Cruickshank,  BOEM  to  Empire  Offshore  Wind  LLC  (May  19,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/6PUK-5N78. The letter, styled as an Amendment to the stop work order, stated \nthat “[t]hat Order is hereby amended to lift the halt on activities during the ongoing review.” Id. \n179.  In addition to the projects for which construction has been completed or has begun, \nthere are twelve offshore-wind lease areas in the region without contractual commitments to a state \nthat could provide energy to New York.  These lease areas are OCS-A 0500 (Bay State Wind), \nOCS-A 0512 (Empire Wind, for the portion of the lease area not covered by Empire Wind 1), OCS-\nA 0520 (Beacon Wind), OCS-A 0521 (SouthCoast Wind, for the portion of the lease area not \ncommitted to Massachusetts or Rhode Island), OCS-A 0522 (Vineyard Northeast), OCS-A 0537 \n(Bluepoint Wind), OCS-A 0538 (Attentive Energy, for the portion of the lease area not committed \nto Massachusetts or Rhode Island), OCS-A 0539 (Community Offshore Wind), OCS-A 0541 \n(Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind Bight), OCS-A 0544 (Vineyard Mid-Atlantic or Excelsior Wind), \nOCS-A 0549 (Atlantic Shores North) and OCS-A 0561 (New England Wind 2). Of the twelve \nprojects, BOEM has approved the Construction and Operations Plans for only three: Empire Wind, \nSouthCoast Wind, and New England Wind 2. Seven other projects—Bay State Wind, Beacon \nWind, Vineyard Northeast, Attentive Energy, Vineyard Mid-Atlantic, Atlantic Shores North and \nNew England Wind 2—have submitted Construction and Operations Plans but have not yet \nreceived approval; the remaining two have not yet submitted their Construction and Operations \nPlans to BOEM. For all twelve projects, the Wind Directive has created substantial uncertainty \nthat has discouraged the developers from investing and advancing development. For example, the \nfederal government’s FAST-41 public permitting dashboard notes that the Atlantic Shores North \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 38 of 108\n   \n \nproject requested a pause in all milestones and associated deadlines in the permitting schedule \nbecause the Wind Directive “created delays in agency approvals and are expected to continue to \ndo so for an unknown period of time, making it not reasonably feasible for Atlantic Shores to \ncontinue with key deliverables required by the current FAST-41 permitting timetable.” Permitting \nDashboard, Atlantic  Shores  North,  https://tinyurl.com/3w7hm4xr.  In  addition,  the  FAST-41 \ndashboard notes that for at least one project—Bluepoint Wind 1—BOEM itself is “is choosing to \ndelay development of a permitting timetable until completion of the assessments outlined in the \n[Wind Directive].” Permitting Dashboard, Bluepoint Wind 1, https://tinyurl.com/3z99t5my. Upon \ninformation and belief, if the Wind Directive were vacated, these projects would once again \ncontinue to proceed through the permitting and development process, enabling them to be available \nto provide energy to New York.  \n180.  Thirty-one land-based  wind  projects  have  been  constructed  and  are  currently \noperating  in  New  York  (totaling  over  2,800  megawatts),  and  two  are  under  construction \nrepresenting 457 megawatts of nameplate capacity.  \n181.  There are more than more than 20 land-based wind projects in development in New \nYork State in various stages of development. Many of these projects have not yet received their \nnecessary federal permits. Land-based wind projects contracted with NYSERDA are expected to \nprovide hundreds of millions of dollars in incremental economic benefits to New York State. Of \nthis, a significant amount is expected to be paid directly to local authorities (including towns, \ncounties and school districts) via Payments In Lieu Of Taxes (PILOT) and host community \nagreements. These projects would also provide financial support directly to the residents of towns \nwhere the projects are built through bill credits paid annually over the first 10 years of the projects’ \noperation.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 39 of 108\n   \n \n182.  The wind-energy industry supported over 4,400 jobs in New York State as of 2023. \nAdditional wind projects are anticipated to accrue similar economic benefits, amounting to many \nbillions of dollars of in-state spending, many thousands of local jobs (in aggregate, approximately \n18,000 to 23,000 jobs are projected to be tied to offshore wind development in New York State), \nand significant attendant economic benefits throughout the state and the country. \n183.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation also threaten supply \nchain projects related to the wind industry. For example, Atlantic Offshore’s Arthur Kill Terminal, \na 32-acre state-of-the-art offshore-wind staging and assembly port facility under development in \nStaten Island, is poised to play an important role as part of the infrastructure supporting offshore \nwind energy servicing New York and the region. The Terminal is expected to bring thousands of \njobs to Staten Island and regional workers during both construction and operation of the port \nfacility, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in local spending to Staten Island and the \nsurrounding area. Construction of the project is being partially financed by a $48 million grant \nfrom the New York State Urban Development Corporation through a federal grant. See 89 Fed. \nReg. 65,483 (Aug. 9, 2024).  \n184.  After a multiyear design phase, construction of the Arthur Kill Terminal project was \nto begin this year, with operations expected to begin in 2027. That schedule has been disrupted, \nhowever, because, upon information and belief, the Corps has halted consideration of applications \nfor permits under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors \nAct, citing the Wind Directive as the basis for halting its review of those permits. That delay is not \njust holding up the project, but also jeopardizing the Terminal’s ability to use the $48 million grant \ngiven the September 30 deadline for completion of NEPA review. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 40 of 108\n   \n \n185.  As another example of a supply-side business premised on continued wind-energy \ndevelopment, Equinor is also executing on a major capital investment plan to turn the South \nBrooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT), located in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, into a \nstate-of-the-art staging and assembly facility for offshore-wind components that will also serve as \na regional operations and maintenance hub for Empire Wind 1 and other offshore wind projects. \nNYSERDA has entered into a grant agreement with the Equinor subsidiary responsible for these \nimprovements to SBMT, under which NYSERDA has committed to provide $60 million upon \nsubstantial completion of the work. Construction on the project commenced in June 2024 and is \nwell underway.  \n186.  The Wind  Directive  and Agency  Defendants’  implementing  actions  also  risk \nstranding significant investments New York has made in support of wind energy. \n187.  For  example,  the  Public  Service  Commission  has  approved  over  $8  billion \ninvestment in transmission improvement projects that support wind and other renewable resources. \nThis investment includes the approval of 62 local transmission projects to support the integration \nof clean energy sources in upstate areas, including wind generation; Con Edison’s proposal to \ndevelop the Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub to address the local reliability needs and increased \ndemand associated with the electrification of vehicles and buildings in New York City as well as \nprovide interconnection points for up to 4,500 megawatts of new energy resources, including \noffshore wind; and upgrades to enhance reliability for Long Island and New York City and allow \nmore efficient distribution of electricity generated by existing resources as well as the potential \nintegration of new electric generation resources including renewable-energy resources.  \n188.  The continued addition of wind generation in New York’s energy mix provides \ncritical resource diversity benefits to the State’s energy system. The New York Independent System \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 41 of 108\n   \n \nOperator (NYISO) has found that resource diversity of all types in fuel source, mode of operation, \ngeography, and size can contribute to the resilience and reliability of the system. Wind power can \nproduce  electricity  at  times  when  solar  energy  facilities  cannot.  In  this  way,  wind  energy \ncomplements the increasing amount of solar generation being developed in New York. \n189.  NYISO modeling also shows that deployment of renewable energy resources—\nincluding land-based and offshore-wind projects—has the potential to reduce resource production \ncosts by displacing generation that would otherwise clear the market at a higher price. This effect \noccurs because these resources reduce the need for low-efficiency power plants and provide long-\nterm price stability, while also increasing energy independence by reducing the need to import \nfuels into New York from other states and countries. \n190.  Offshore wind projects such as Empire Wind 1, Sunrise Wind, and future projects \nwill interconnect to New York’s Zones J (New York City) and K (Long Island), which the NYISO \nidentifies to be constrained areas, meaning that each zone must be served primarily by local \ngenerators (such as offshore-wind projects) due to transmission limitations. \n191.  Offshore wind projects can provide critical energy diversity benefits to these \nconstrained zones. A recent analysis commissioned by the NYISO found that the availability of a \nlarge quantity of offshore-wind energy able to be injected directly into the grid serving New York \nCity and Long Island enhances grid reliability in modeled seventeen-day cold weather events as a \ncomplement to natural gas and oil-fired units by reducing dependency on oil inventories and \nhelping to preserve limited oil and natural gas supplies. \n192.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  actions  categorically  and \nindefinitely halting wind-energy approvals also undermine New York’s implementation of the \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 42 of 108\n   \n \nClimate Act by increasing the need for and cost of state actions to further reduce greenhouse-gas \nemissions to achieve its statewide emission limits under the Climate Act.  \n193.  In addition, the Wind Directive and the Agency Defendants’ implementing actions \nthreaten significant adverse environmental and public health consequences to New York residents, \nincluding by delaying much needed air quality improvements by stalling the transition from fossil \nfuels to renewable energy sources, increasing reliance on aging natural gas “peaking units.” \nIncreased offshore-wind generation in the locations where these peaking facilities are most used—\nthe New York City metropolitan ozone nonattainment area—would reduce emissions and improve \nair quality for New Yorkers. \nMassachusetts \n194.  In 2022, Massachusetts enacted An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind. \nSt. 2022, c. 179. The Act aimed to move Massachusetts toward its mandate of net-zero greenhouse-\ngas emissions by 2050 through the promotion and development of offshore wind, including by \nrequiring procurement of 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by June 30, 2027.  Id. § 61(b). \nMassachusetts also has an RPS, which requires that retail energy suppliers annually increase the \nshare of renewable energy generation that is supplied to electricity customers. Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 25A, § 11F. \n195.  The Act directed the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to coordinate \nand lead a wind-energy procurement process with a staggered schedule. The fourth procurement \nprocess is underway, and the fifth was supposed to begin this year. Massachusetts thus far has three \nprojects that are currently in different stages of development and permitting, which together, once \nconstructed, would provide 2,678 megawatts of offshore wind. \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 43 of 108\n   \n \n196.  Vineyard  Offshore  and  Avangrid’s  Vineyard  Wind  1,  selected  in  the \nCommonwealth’s first procurement process, will ultimately supply 800 megawatts of electricity, \nenough to power over 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind 1 received \nits  final  federal  permits  in  2021  and  started  producing  reliable  and  affordable  energy  to \nMassachusetts customers in January 2024.  \n197.  Massachusetts’s second project, Ocean Winds’s SouthCoast, is expected to produce \n1,087 megawatts of electricity for Massachusetts and 200 megawatts for Rhode Island. SouthCoast \nCOP ES-1 (Nov. 2024), https://perma.cc/93X3-K5HG. The SouthCoast project is projected to \nenhance grid reliability, contribute to state procurement goals, and annually reduce greenhouse \ngases  equivalent  to  emissions  from  800,000  motor  vehicles.  See  SouthCoast  ROD  78,  84, \nhttps://perma.cc/LRY3-AFS7. The project has secured most federal approvals—including its \nConstruction and Operations Plan. Before January 20, 2025, Agency Defendants had informed \nSouthCoast that it would receive its three outstanding permits as scheduled by March 27, 2025, \nand the Army Corps had already approved its Section 404 permit and merely needed to issue it. \nBOEM, SouthCoast Record of Decision 37–39, 90 (Dec. 20, 2024), https://perma.cc/LRY3-AFS7. \nSince January 20, 2025, however, progress on three outstanding approvals has been paused solely \ndue to the Wind Directive, and the approval timeline has been delayed until September 2025. \nOcean Winds is negotiating power purchase agreements with Massachusetts utilities in the fourth \nprocurement. The uncertainty created by the Wind Directive creates risk for the project and its \npower purchase agreement negotiations.  \n198.  Due to the Wind Directive, SouthCoast has already had to cancel critical supply-\nchain contracts and delay the project by two years.  As a result, the company is incurring \n$70 million in annual costs. Due to the Wind Directive, pending power purchase agreement \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 44 of 108\n   \n \nnegotiations for delivery of electricity from the SouthCoast project to Massachusetts have already \nbeen delayed from March until the end of June. If the halt is not lifted, the company likely will be \nforced to altogether abandon power purchase agreement negotiations in both Massachusetts and \nRhode Island, indefinitely stalling the project. If the halt is lifted, SouthCoast will be able to obtain \nits three outstanding permits and move forward with developing the project. There is no alternative \nelectric generation project proposed in New England that is able to construct and come online in \nthe same timeframe as the SouthCoast project, let alone one that could deliver power into the \nEastern region of the state. As a result, without the SouthCoast project Massachusetts would be \nunable to meet its statutory goal to procure 5,600 MW of offshore-wind energy by 2027. \n199.  The third offshore-wind project in the Massachusetts pipeline is Avangrid’s New \nEngland Wind 1, a 791-megawatt project that was set to begin construction in 2025 and to start \ngenerating electricity in 2029. The project has obtained all required federal permits, and Avangrid \nis negotiating power purchase agreements with Massachusetts utilities in the fourth procurement. \nNegotiations are delayed in tandem with the Ocean Winds negotiations. Onshore wind is also an \nimportant part of the electricity generation mix serving Massachusetts. Electric Distribution \nCompanies  in  the  Commonwealth  have  signed  long-term  contracts  with  seven  utility-scale \nprojects, which have achieved commercial operation and are currently generating 625 megawatts \nof renewable energy for Massachusetts residents and businesses.  \n200.  Additionally, there are substantial onshore-wind resources available in northern \nNew England that have not yet been developed. Massachusetts, along with other New England \nstates, has been working with the regional grid operator ISO-New England (ISO-NE) to unlock \nthis potential, but the uncertainty created by the federal government presents new hurdles and \ndrives up costs.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 45 of 108\n   \n \n201.  Delay or indefinite stall of offshore-wind projects, including the SouthCoast \nproject, would delay, or altogether deprive the Commonwealth of important reliability and \naffordability, economic, clean energy and climate, and emission-reduction benefits.  If the halt is \nlifted, wind projects, including SouthCoast, would proceed toward development, mitigating the \nrisk of delay or loss of such benefits.  \n202.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  actions  categorically  and \nindefinitely  halting  wind-energy  approvals  threaten  energy  reliability  and  affordability  to \nMassachusetts ratepayers, including the Commonwealth as a ratepayer. In 2024, 55% of the \nelectricity produced by New England’s power plants was fueled by natural gas. ISO-NE, Resource \nMix, https://perma.cc/3EA3-6T96. \n203.  New England energy demand is projected to rise nine percent over the next ten \nyears. Additionally, Massachusetts is on its way to becoming a winter-peaking state, meaning \nelectricity demand is highest in the colder months, and Massachusetts’s natural-gas infrastructure \nis running close to maximum capacity on the coldest days.  \n204.  When natural-gas power plants cannot secure enough supply to generate electricity, \nmore expensive and often more polluting generators are brought online to produce electricity, \nresulting in higher prices for Massachusetts electricity customers and more harmful emissions for \nMassachusetts communities. \n205.  And  Massachusetts’s  reliance  on  natural  gas  leaves  consumers  vulnerable  to \nfluctuations in natural-gas prices, and corresponding fluctuations and spikes in electricity prices.  \n206.  Offshore-wind generation is expected to reduce the instances of higher variable cost \nelectric generators being dispatched by ISO-NE.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 46 of 108\n   \n \n207.  Offshore wind has its highest capacity factor during the coldest months, when the \ngenerating system for electricity production in Massachusetts is most strained. ISO-NE, Variable \nEnergy Resource Data, https://perma.cc/2ZCX-NZTC. \n208.  Wind  energy  can  lower  wholesale  energy  market  costs  in  New  England  by \ndisplacing more expensive marginal-cost generation from fossil fuels. ISO-NE recently found that \nwithout offshore wind the cost of energy to New England customers is expected to increase by \nabout 50% in 2050. Kornitsky et al., 2024 Economic Study, ISO-NE, at slide 23 (Mar. 19, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/EDS6-NJZJ. Under this projection, these cost increases will significantly harm \nthe Commonwealth’s residents and ratepayers, including the University of Massachusetts who \nwould be forced to pay about $39 million more in energy costs in 2050. \n209.  Additionally, ISO-NE found in 2023 that New England would need to replace over \n5,000 megawatts of aging fossil fueled generation in the coming years with new sources of power \ngeneration to maintain a reliable grid. ISO-NE, Overview and Regional Update, at slide 13 \n(Jan. 19, 2023), https://perma.cc/U4BB-Y48S; ISO-NE, Operational Impact of Extreme Weather \nEvents  (2023),  https://perma.cc/9UXZ-299Q.  By  contributing  new  power  generation  and \ndiversifying the region’s electricity mix, wind and other renewable energy resources can help \naddress these reliability concerns. ISO-NE has already integrated wind energy projects into its \nregional models and is relying on offshore wind to ensure continued reliability. And there are \npresently zero alternative utility-scale electric generation projects proposed in New England that \nwould be able to construct and come online in the same timeframe as the SouthCoast project, for \nexample, and no other renewable-energy projects are available at that scale at this time due to \nlimited available land and high population density (solar), geologic conditions (geothermal), or \nlegal impediments and permitting and construction horizons (nuclear). \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 47 of 108\n   \n \n210.  ISO-NE also has found that wind energy can benefit grid reliability by easing \ndemand during peak periods such as winter storms. As a case in point, in 2018 ISO-NE found that \n1,600 megawatts of offshore-wind generation during an extended cold weather period from \nDecember 24, 2017, to January 8, 2018, could have resulted in substantial economic environmental \nbenefits, including: (1) lowering regional electricity production costs by $80 million to $85 \nmillion, resulting in an $11 to $13 per megawatt-hour reduction in ISO-NE day-ahead energy \nmarket prices; (2) avoiding emissions of 219,200 short tons of CO , reducing regional CO  \n2 2\nemissions from electricity production during the period by 11%; and (3) avoiding consumption of \n5,300 short tons of coal, 1.81 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 160,200 barrels of oil. ISO-NE, \nHigh-Level Assessment of Potential Impacts of Offshore Wind Additions to the New England Power \nSystem During the 2017-2018 Cold Spell (Dec. 17, 2018), https://perma.cc/U5G7-4UV6. \n211.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  actions  categorically  and \nindefinitely halting wind-energy approvals also threaten important and growing employment \nopportunities, jeopardize financial commitments, and risk stranding significant investments by \nMassachusetts  in wind  energy. The three selected Massachusetts  offshore-wind projects are \nanticipated to create more than 10,000 jobs, with the existing offshore-wind project already \ngenerating 3,405 full-time equivalent jobs. Additionally, SouthCoast Wind intends to execute \nfinancial  commitments  including:  $35  million  ports  and  infrastructure,  $10  million  local \ninnovation and entrepreneurship, $5 million applied research, $5 million workforce development, \n$10 million marine science, $7.5 million operations and maintenance port upgrades, and $5 million \nlow income strategic electrification.  \n212.  Massachusetts, through the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC), has \ninvested $347,000,000 since 2011 in offshore-wind infrastructure; workforce training; supply \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 48 of 108\n   \n \nchains;  and  research  and  development.  This  includes:  $135,000,000  via  the  Massachusetts \nOffshore  Wind  Ports  Investment  Challenge  program;  $149,000,000  in  funding  for  facility \nimprovements to ensure that the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, which MassCEC owns \nand  operates,  can  accommodate  future  offshore-wind  projects;  $18,000,000  to  various \norganizations as a part of the Offshore Wind Works grant program, designed to increase the \nCommonwealth’s  capacity  to  create  a  capable  offshore-wind  workforce;  and  $5,600,000  to \ndeveloping and administering a supply chain directory.  \n213.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the Agency  Defendants’  implementing  actions  also \nthreaten Massachusetts’s ability to meet its greenhouse-gas emission-reduction goals and RPS, as \nwell as its specific statutory requirements for procuring offshore wind, including the requirement \nto procure 5,600 MW by 2027. In 2024, Massachusetts’s planning models indicated that in order \nto meet the Commonwealth’s 2030 emission-reduction sublimits, 3,650 MW of offshore wind \ngeneration would need to be available by 2030. \n214.  With  1,500  miles  of  coastline,  and  5.2  million  people  or  73%  of  the \nCommonwealth’s  population  residing  in  coastal  communities,  Massachusetts  is  particularly \nvulnerable to sea-level rise and increasingly frequent extreme weather events attributed to climate \nchange. Over the twenty-first century, Massachusetts is projected to experience approximately 4.0 \nto 7.6 feet of sea-level rise, and estimates of coastal property damage for the Commonwealth are \nexpected to reach over $1 billion per year by the 2070s. Flooding due to climate change will harm \nthe approximately 177 Commonwealth-owned parks, beaches, reservations, wildlife refuges, \nroads, parkways, piers and dams, and necessitate increasing expenditures to protect, repair, and \nrebuild the Commonwealth’s properties, expected to increase to about $17 million in the 2030s. \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 49 of 108\n   \n \n215.  Without wind-energy development, Massachusetts will need to find different and \nmore expensive ways to achieve its climate goals and mitigate the risk of these impacts. Indeed, \nwithout  offshore-wind  energy  available  to  bring  online,  the  total  annualized  build  costs  to \nMassachusetts’s climate mandates would increase by $26 billion. Kornitsky et al., supra, at 21. \nArizona \n216.  Arizona  has  more  than  1,300  megawatts  of  onshore  wind  capacity  under \ndevelopment at three sites in northern and eastern Arizona: Forged Ethic, West Camp, and Lava \nRun. Despite being sited on private and Arizona State Trust Land, all three projects are subject to \nfederal permitting review, including under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.  \n217.  In Arizona, State Trust Land is leased to private land users. State Trust Land lease \nrevenues are used to fund public education from kindergarten through college. \n218.  Forged Ethic will provide 323 megawatts of wind-generation capacity, millions of \ndollars in State Trust Land lease payments, lease payments to local, private landowners, and tens \nof millions of dollars in local tax revenues or PILOT payments to Coconino County.  \n219.  The Bureau of Reclamation will conduct a NEPA review of Forged Ethic’s request \nto interconnect to a transmission system partially owned by the Bureau. \n220.  West Camp is designed to provide up to 504 megawatts of wind generating capacity. \nWest Camp will pay millions of dollars to lease State Trust Land, as well as lease payments to \nprivate landowners, and local tax revenues or PILOT payments to Navajo County.  \n221.  Lava  Run  will  provide  500  megawatts  of  wind  generating  capacity,  while \ncontributing an estimated $75 million to lease State Trust Land and $31.5 million in property tax \nrevenues over 35 years to Apache County. Lava Run will also provide revenue to local landowners.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 50 of 108\n   \n \n222.  Arizona’s three largest electric utilities plan to procure gigawatts of additional wind \ngenerating capacity over the next two decades. Utilities plan to invest in wind because, in concert \nwith solar, battery energy storage, and natural-gas-fired generation, wind energy provides the least \nexpensive and most reliable power. \nCalifornia \n223.  Wind energy provides many benefits to California, including as an important \nrenewable energy resource and in meeting California’s renewable energy and climate policies.  \n224.  In 2023, wind energy accounted for approximately 11% of California’s total energy \ngeneration and approximately 6% of total in-state energy generation.  \n225.  California has enacted several renewable energy and climate goals and policies. For \nexample, California’s 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018 (SB 100) and Clean Energy, Jobs, \nand Affordability Act (SB 1020), among other things, require that renewable-energy resources and \nzero-carbon resources supply 100% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers \nby  December  31,  2045,  and  100%  of  electricity  procured  to  serve  all  state  agencies  by \nDecember 31,  2035.  Cal.  Pub.  Util.  Code  §  454.53. Additional  interim  targets  require  that \nrenewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity \nto California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% of all retail sales of electricity to \nCalifornia end-use customers by December 31, 2040. Id. SB 100 also increased California’s \nRenewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) target to require utilities to procure 60% of retail sales from \nrenewable sources by 2030. Cal. Pub. Util. Code § 399.15. \n226.  The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (SB 32) also requires \nreducing statewide greenhouse-gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Cal. Health & \nSafety Code § 38566. The California Climate Crisis Act (AB 1279) requires California to achieve \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 51 of 108\n   \n \ncarbon neutrality as soon as possible, but no later than 2045, and to reduce statewide greenhouse-\ngas emissions to at least 85% below 1990 levels by 2045. Cal. Health & Safety Code § 38562.2. \n227.   The State anticipates using wind energy to meet these climate goals and energy \npolicies. California has set goals to develop 2 to 5 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 and \n25 gigawatts by 2045 pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 25991.1. California \nhas also established a program to support, including via financial incentives, the buildout of \noffshore- wind facilities by supporting the improved capabilities of California ports, harbors, and \nother waterfront facilities. Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 25666. In September 2024, the California \nEnergy Commission released a competitive solicitation pursuant to that program to fund proposed \nprojects.  \n228.  Wind energy helps to  diversify California’s portfolio of renewable electricity \nresources, reduce total resource costs, and improve the reliability and resiliency of California’s \nelectricity system. Wind energy can also complement the generation attributes of other renewable-\nenergy resources. \n229.  There are five federal wind leases off California’s coast. Two are located offshore \nin Northern California near Humboldt, California, the remaining three are located offshore in \nCentral California near Morro Bay. The leases were effective as of June 1, 2023. The leases support \nthe development of floating offshore wind in deep-water sites.  \n230.  In exchange for bidding credits, the lessees committed to providing collectively \nover $50 million to communities, Native American tribes, or interested parties that may be \nimpacted from the lease development through Community Benefit Agreements. The lessees also \ncommitted to providing workforce training and domestic supply chain development benefits.  \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 52 of 108\n   \n \n231.  The  offshore-wind  leases  are  expected  to  provide  additional  economic  and \nworkforce benefits to California. \n232.  There  are  over  one  hundred  onshore-wind  projects  throughout  California. \nAdditional onshore-wind projects are also proposed to be built in the state.  \n233.  California is also currently processing an application for an offshore-wind project \nin state waters near Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. The developer has \nindicated that the project is likely to require federal review and approvals, which would likely be \nimpacted by the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation. This wind project is \nalso anticipated to provide economic and workforce benefits to California.  \n234.  As  discussed  above,  BOEM  has  cancelled  virtual  public  meetings  regarding \nBOEM’s programmatic NEPA review for future offshore-wind development in California, citing \nthe Wind Directive.  \n235.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  actions  categorically  and \nindefinitely halting wind-energy approvals threaten the viability of proposed and future wind-\nenergy generation projects in California. Those wind-energy projects would deliver economic \nbenefits; reduce air pollution, including in areas in nonattainment of federal and state air quality \nstandards, by stalling the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources; and improve \ngrid reliability through increased diversification of energy sources.  \nColorado \n236.  Wind energy has played a role in the evolution of Colorado’s greenhouse-gas \nemission-reduction goals. In 2019, Colorado enacted legislation setting statewide greenhouse-gas \nemission reduction targets of 26% by 2025, 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050, all compared to a \n2005 baseline. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 25-7-102(2)(g) (2019). Four years later, Colorado increased \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 53 of 108\n   \n \ninterim targets to include a 65% reduction by 2035, 75% reduction by 2040, and a 90% reduction \nby 2045, and updated the 2050 target to set a 100% reduction goal in net statewide greenhouse-\ngas pollution by 2050. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 25-7-102(2)(g). To meet these goals, the statute instructs \nutilities to seek to provide their customers with energy generated from 100% clean energy \nresources by 2050. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 40-2-125.5(3)(a)(II).  \n237.  Colorado energy producers utilize wind energy to meet Colorado’s greenhouse-gas \nemission-reduction goals. In 2023, wind power accounted for 28% of the state’s total energy \ngeneration and 70% of renewable generation in Colorado. After more than quadrupling its use of \nwind energy from 2010, Colorado now ranks sixth nationwide for installed wind generating \ncapacity. Continued installation of wind energy is essential for Colorado to achieve its 100% \nreduction goal in net statewide greenhouse-gas pollution by 2050, as contained in Colo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 25-7-102. \n238.  Colorado  had  roughly  5,000  megawatts  of  wind  installed  in  2022.  In  2021, \nColorado modeled meeting state-wide energy needs through 2040. Under the least-cost scenario, \nutilities would need to deploy an additional 9,300 megawatts of wind energy to meet the state’s \n2030 goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80% from a 2005 baseline.  \n239.  Wind provides the lowest cost electricity, supplying the state with roughly 71% of \nits total electricity. Replacing wind with other resources increases costs to consumers.  \n240.  The same study also showed that utilities would have roughly 10.6 gigawatts of \nwind installed in 2040. Other scenarios range from 12 gigawatts to roughly 22 gigawatts. \nConnecticut \n241.  Connecticut  has  worked  to  shift  reliance  away  from  fossil  fuels  and  toward \nrenewable-energy sources, including wind. Connecticut has had an RPS in some form since 1998. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 54 of 108\n   \n \nThe RPS requires electric suppliers to obtain a specified percentage of the energy they sell or \ndistribute to Connecticut customers from renewable sources through the purchase of Renewable \nEnergy Certificates (RECs). The total renewable output targets have increased each year, and \nPublic Act  18-50,  codified  at  Connecticut  General  Statutes  §  16-245a,  doubled  the  RPS \nrequirement from 20% by 2020 to 40% by 2030.  \n242.  Under  Public Act  18-82,  “An Act  Concerning  Climate  Change Planning  and \nResiliency,” Connecticut must achieve state economy-wide greenhouse-gas emission reductions \nof at least 45% below 2001 levels by 2030, adding to the existing requirement of at least 80% \nbelow 2001 levels by 2050. Public Act 22-5, “An Act Concerning Climate Change Mitigation,” \nrequires Connecticut to achieve a 100% greenhouse-gas emissions-free electricity supply by 2040. \n243.  In addition, in passing Public Act 19-71, “An Act Concerning the Procurement of \nEnergy Derived from Offshore Wind,” the Connecticut Legislature created a process for the \nDepartment of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) to work with other state officials to \nsolicit competitive proposals for offshore-wind projects. The Act also authorizes DEEP to direct \nthe state’s electric distribution companies to enter into long-term contracts with bidders meeting \ncertain criteria, which DEEP has done. DEEP also has similar procurement authority for additional \nClass I renewable-energy resources, including both onshore and offshore wind. Conn. Gen. Stat. \n§§ 16a-3f, 16a-3g, 16a-3h, 16a-3j, and 16a-3m.  \n244.  In 2018 and 2019, using its authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 16a-3n and 16a-\n3m, DEEP selected 200 megawatts and 104 megawatts from the Revolution Wind offshore-wind \nproject  in  two  separate  competitive  solicitations. The  Public  Utilities  Regulatory Authority \n(PURA) subsequently approved contracts with Connecticut’s electric distribution companies, \nEversource and United Illuminating. The project is expected to reach commercial operation in \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 55 of 108\n   \n \n2026,  at  which  point  it  will  deliver  electricity,  and  associated  renewable-energy  credits,  to \nConnecticut, as well as provide wholesale energy and capacity market and reliability benefits to \nthe broader New England grid. \n245.  Connecticut  had  previously  approved  procurements  from  two  onshore-wind \nprojects: 126 megawatts from the Cassadaga project and 5 megawatts from the Holiday Hill \nCommunity Wind project. These projects achieved commercial operation in 2021 and 2018, \nrespectively, and are providing energy and RECs to support Connecticut’s energy needs and clean \nenergy targets.  \n246.  Connecticut also has an interest in future procurements of wind energy. Public \nAct 19-71 provides DEEP with existing statutory authority to conduct competitive solicitations for \nup to 2,000 megawatts of additional offshore wind to meet Connecticut’s energy needs and clean-\nenergy targets. DEEP also has additional authority to conduct new competitive solicitations for \noffshore wind and onshore wind under Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 16a-3f, 16a-3g, 16a-3h, 16a-3j, and \n16a-3m. DEEP’s October 2021 Integrated Resources Plan found that, to achieve the state’s target \nof a 100% greenhouse-gas emissions-free electricity supply by January 1, 2040, significant \nadditions of new zero-carbon generation will be required. This need includes potentially 352–557 \nmegawatts of new onshore wind and 3,745-5,710 megawatts of new offshore wind by 2040 under \na range of assumptions and scenarios, including availability of other generating resources. \n247.   Connecticut is also working regionally with other states and ISO-NE to advance \nwind energy. On March 31, 2025, ISO-NE issued a request for proposals (RFP) from transmission \ndevelopers to upgrade the transmission grid in Maine to accommodate the interconnection of at \nleast 1,200 megawatts of onshore wind generation to the New England grid.  \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 56 of 108\n   \n \n248.  This RFP is the first procurement being conducted as part of a new regional \ntransmission planning and procurement process that Connecticut worked to develop with ISO-NE \nand the other New England states, and which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \napproved last year. One piece of this approved framework was an agreement by the six New \nEngland states to allocate the costs of any selected project equitably across the states based on each \nstate’s share of regional electricity load. The New England states requested that the first RFP issued \nby ISO-NE under this new process focus on transmission upgrades in Maine to facilitate onshore-\nwind development, which will lower wholesale energy and capacity market costs and improve grid \nreliability in Connecticut and across the region. \n249.  Wind generation contributes to grid reliability by reducing Connecticut’s reliance \non fossil fuels, all of which must be imported from outside the region. New England currently \nrelies on natural gas to generate approximately half of the region’s electricity. This creates \nreliability concerns during the winter, when there is high natural gas demand for heating, or in \ncases where unanticipated disruptions to the pipeline system or unavailability of gas limit the \nability of natural gas-fired generators to run. Wind energy can help fill these gaps and reduce the \nregion’s reliance on natural gas.  \n250.  By reducing reliance on fossil fuels, Connecticut’s efforts to bring wind energy \nonline also help insulate the state’s electricity ratepayers from price spikes and volatility associated \nwith fossil fuels.  \n251.  In addition to procuring energy from wind, Connecticut has invested in facilities \nsuch  as  the  redeveloped  Connecticut  State  Pier  Terminal  in  New  London  to  support  the \ndevelopment of offshore wind and create new jobs and economic-development opportunities in \nthe State. The State has committed over $200 million to the redevelopment of the State Pier \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 57 of 108\n   \n \nTerminal. The Terminal is one of only three marshaling facilities on the East Coast that are \nassembling offshore-wind turbines for deployment, and was the first one with open ocean access. \nThe Terminal is already supporting the assembly and delivery of approximately 160 turbines for \nthree offshore wind projects—South Fork Wind, Revolution Wind, and Sunrise Wind—that will \nprovide power to Connecticut, New York, and Rhode Island. Once installed, these projects will \nhave an estimated output of 1,760 megawatts, enough to power more than 1 million homes. Staging \nand assembly operations at the terminal are expected to generate more than 100 well-paying jobs. \nThe Terminal also has the potential to support further offshore wind deployments, together with \nassociated jobs in Connecticut.  \n252.  By introducing regulatory uncertainty in the development of new onshore wind and \noffshore wind, the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ implementation harm Connecticut in \nnumerous ways.  \n253.  The Wind Directive and its implementation undermine Connecticut’s ability to \nprocure additional energy from onshore- and offshore-wind generation as needed to meet the \nstate’s energy and environmental requirements, including statutory requirements to reduce in-state \ngreenhouse-gas emissions and transition the state’s electricity supply to non-greenhouse-gas-\nemitting  sources  of  power. As  a  result,  the  Wind  Directive  and  its  implementation  harm \nConnecticut’s ability to protect its residents, as part of a broader effort, from the growing impacts \nof climate change, which include increased flooding, extreme heat, wildfires, and extreme storms.  \n254.  The  Wind  Directive  and  its  implementation  also  threaten  the  reliability  of \nConnecticut’s electricity grid. Delaying or preventing development of new wind energy in the \nregion prevents Connecticut and other New England states from bringing new energy resources \nonline that ISO-NE has determined are important to ensuring a reliable grid.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 58 of 108\n   \n \n255.  Furthermore, the Wind Directive and its implementation undermine Connecticut’s \nability to ensure affordable electricity and protect the state’s electricity ratepayers by developing \nwind-energy resources that will lower wholesale energy and capacity-market costs and will reduce \nthe state’s reliance on price-volatile fossil fuels.  \nDelaware \n256.  Wind energy is one of the sources of energy covered in Delaware’s Renewable \nEnergy Portfolio Standards Act. 26 Del. C. § 352. The law was based on a finding that the benefits \nof electricity from renewable energy resources accrue to the public at large, and that electric \nsuppliers and consumers share an obligation to develop a minimum level of clean energy in the \nelectricity supply portfolio of the State. These benefits include improved regional and local air \nquality, improved public health, increased electric supply diversity, increased protection against \nprice volatility and supply disruption, improved transmission and distribution performance, and \nnew economic development opportunities. 26 Del. C. § 351. The Act required that retail sales of \nelectricity include a minimum percentage of “eligible energy resources” and solar photovoltaics, \nculminating in 2035 with at least 40% of the former and at least 10% of the latter. 26 Del. C. \n§ 354(a). Wind energy qualifies as an “eligible energy resource[].” 26 Del. C. § 352(8).  \n257.  In enacting Delaware Climate Change Solutions Act of 2023, 84 Del. Laws, c. 141, \n§ 1, the Delaware’s General Assembly found that: (1) anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse \ngases are contributing to climate change; (2) climate change threatens the health and well-being of \nthe people of Delaware; (3) climate change poses risk to Delaware’s continued economic vitality; \nand (4) actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase resiliency have co-benefits \nto economic development, job opportunities, public health and air and water quality. 7 Del. C. \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 59 of 108\n   \n \nc. 100. The Climate Change Solutions Act mandates a 50% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions \nbelow 2005 levels by 2030. The goal by 2050 is net zero greenhouse-gas emissions.  \n258.  Related to these goals, Delaware is the future home to infrastructure necessary to \nsupport the U.S. Wind project in Maryland, described below. U.S. Wind has purchased 140 acres \nof land surrounding the existing Indian River Power Plant in Delaware for up to three substations \nto accommodate the incoming power and connect it to the grid. The project, which is undergoing \ncounty  review,  could  generate  over  two  gigawatts  of  electricity,  suitable  to  power  over \n718,000 homes. This would save Delaware ratepayers a projected $253 million in utility bills over \nthe twenty-year lifespan of the turbines, reducing average bills by $9 a month. \nDistrict of Columbia \n259.  Under the District of Columbia’s RPS, D.C. is currently required to receive 52% of \nits energy supply from renewable energy sources located within the PJM Interconnection (PJM)’s \nfootprint. Each year, the required amount of clean energy supply increases, reaching 100% by \n2032. Further, under the Clean Energy D.C. Omnibus Amendment Act, the District must reduce \ngreenhouse-gas emissions each year with the ultimate goal of achieving a 100% reduction—or net \nzero greenhouse-gas emissions—by 2045. Currently, wind energy from projects within PJM \nsupply 4–5% of the District’s energy directly, while the balance is supplied through the purchase \nof RECs generated from clean-energy sources within PJM. Thus, the cost of energy in D.C. is \nhighly dependent on the supply of clean energy in PJM. And while the amount of energy supplied \ndirectly by wind to D.C. is small in comparison to fossil fuel sources, wind is by far the largest \nsource of clean energy within PJM—the future development of which holds the greatest potential \nof helping D.C. achieve its clean energy and climate goals at a reasonable price.  \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 60 of 108\n   \n \n260.  Conversely, policies that hinder the development of wind energy—such as the Wind \nDirective and Agency Defendants’ implementation—will drive up the cost of energy in D.C. and \nmake it less likely that the District will meet its clean-energy and climate goals.  \nIllinois \n261.  Illinois  has  a robust  wind  industry,  with  10,198  megawatts  of  wind  projects \noperating as of November 2024.  \n262.  Wind power constituted 12.27% of all electricity generated in Illinois in 2023, with \nover 21 million megawatt hours generated from wind projects.  \n263.  In  2021,  Illinois  enacted  the  Climate  and  Equitable  Jobs Act,  which  directs \ngreenhouse-gas emission reductions across all areas of Illinois’s economy, including electricity \ngeneration. The law commits Illinois to 100% carbon-free energy generation by 2045, with interim \ngoals of 40% by 2030 and 50% by 2040.  \n264.  Illinois also has an RPS, as memorialized through Section 1-75(c) of the Illinois \nPower Agency Act, which requires the Illinois Power Agency to attempt to procure cost-effective \nrenewable energy resources equal to 40% of each Illinois electric utility’s load by 2030, climbing \nto 50% of each utility’s load by 2040. Additionally, to comply with the Illinois RPS, the Illinois \nPower Agency “shall endeavor to procure 45% from new and repowered wind and hydropower \nprojects.” Because RPS compliance may not involve the development of new dams, hydropower \nis not expected to play a significant role in achieving the RPS. \n265.  To  meet  its  statutory  commitments,  the  Illinois  Power  Agency  periodically \nconducts procurements for new wind farms.  \n266.  One procurement yielded a successful bid for a 300 megawatt utility-scale wind \nfarm from Apex Clean Energy. This wind farm, Prosperity Wind, is currently under construction \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 61 of 108\n   \n \nin Galesville, Illinois, a rural farming community. It will produce enough power for 99,000 homes \nand will consist of up to 50 turbines.  \n267.  Other recent Illinois procurements have yielded successful bids for onshore utility-\nscale wind farms that ranged in capacity from 200 megawatts to 450 megawatts.  \n268.  Meeting the Illinois RPS is important to maintain a stable, reliable, and cost-\neffective power supply for at least two reasons. First, new sources of electricity are needed to meet \nunexpected projected load growth Illinois is facing due to data centers and other large load \ncustomers, while simultaneously maintaining a cost-effective power supply for Illinois residents.  \n269.  Second, as outlined in Section 9.15 of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act \n(415 ILCS 5), Illinois law requires that all electricity generating units reduce carbon dioxide and \nco-pollutant emissions to zero by 2045 on a progressive retirement or emission-reduction schedule \nthat takes effect in 2030. Without bringing new wind projects online, Illinois is unlikely to be able \nto satisfy this obligation.  \nMaine \n270.  Wind energy likewise plays a role in Maine’s achievement of climate and clean-\nenergy goals. In 2019, Maine enacted a state law, 38 Me. Rev. Stat. § 576-A, to expand the original \ngreenhouse-gas emission-reduction goals set forth in prior 2003 legislation. The new goals include \nthe reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions to at least 45% below 1990 levels by January 1, 2030, \nand to at least 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. In 2019, Maine Governor Janet Mills signed an \nexecutive order adding the goal of achieving carbon neutrality in Maine by 2045, which was \ncodified in 38 Me. Rev. Stat. § 576-A(2-A).  \n271.  Maine also has an RPS that requires 80% of the electricity sold in Maine to be \nsupplied by renewable energy resources by 2030, and 100% by 2050.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 62 of 108\n   \n \n272.  In addition, the Maine Wind Energy Act, 35-A Me. Rev. Stat. §§ 3402, 3404, \nincludes onshore and offshore statutory goals and requirements, recognizes that wind energy can \nachieve reliable, cost-effective, sustainable energy production, and is a valuable domestic energy \nresource that can help achieve the state’s climate and clean-energy requirements. \n273.  With respect to future energy procurements that influence Maine’s ability to meet \nits RPS, the 2021 Maine Renewable Energy Goals Market Assessment released by the Governor’s \nEnergy Office (GEO) states that “many lower-cost pathways to meet Maine’s RPS requirements \nin the next decade are achievable through the development of high-quality wind resources in \nwestern and northern Maine, which in turn require new transmission investments.” Kasina et al., \nState  of  Maine  Renewable  Energy  Goals  Market  Assessment,  State  of  Maine  GEO,  at  2 \n(Mar. 2021), https://perma.cc/S6HW-N2RH.  \n274.  Onshore-wind energy generated 27% of Maine’s renewable electricity generation \nin 2023, the 10th highest wind power share among U.S. states.  \n275.  Maine currently hosts the majority of New England’s onshore-wind resources with \nover 1000 megawatts installed. Onshore wind generally has its highest capacity at night and during \nthe winter months and therefore balances the almost 7000 megawatts of solar installed in the \nregion, providing an important energy and capacity resource precisely when it is most needed \nduring winter cold spells. Furthermore, Maine enjoys very high wind capacity potential both in \nnorthern Maine as well as along the western Maine mountains and to the east near the shore. These \ndifferent resource areas ensure that even if the wind is not blowing in one area, there can be energy \nproduced from another. Overall, the 1000+ megawatts of onshore wind are currently producing \nfossil-free low-cost energy to benefit Maine ratepayers and helping ensure winter reliability to the \nentire regional grid. \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 63 of 108\n   \n \n276.  In January 2024, the GEO issued the Maine Energy Plan, which outlines strategies \nto further reduce energy costs, ensure reliability and resilience, and increase the diversity of energy \nresources. State of Maine GEO, Maine Energy Plan (Jan. 2025), https://perma.cc/3DRJ-6P93. The \nPlan was informed by an 18-month stakeholder engagement process and an expert technical report. \nThe report found that 100% clean energy is achievable, beneficial, and results in lower overall \nenergy costs across the economy. Murphy et al., Maine Pathways to 2040: Analysis and Insights, \nState of Maine GEO (Jan. 2025), https://perma.cc/PJ3U-R8BU. Both onshore and offshore wind \ndevelopment will play a crucial role in achieving that goal.  \n277.   The Maine legislature has found that integrating Maine’s wind resources is in the \npublic interest and will provide a valuable local energy resource that will reduce reliance on fossil \nfuels and will benefit Maine ratepayers. 35-A 38 Me. Rev. Stat. 3402. \n278.  On April 1, 2025, the Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) released a Request \nfor Information to advance the procurement of northern Maine resources, including wind, and \nassociated transmission. Participation by interested states, such as Massachusetts, would reduce \ncosts to Maine by spreading the investment across all participating states.  \n279.  Developing renewable resources and associated transmission in northern Maine \nprovides a significant opportunity to meet Maine and the region’s energy goals and stabilize costs \nfor ratepayers. Northern Maine possesses some of the highest quality renewable energy potential \nin the region. But Maine has been unable to fully unlock that potential and the accompanying \neconomic and community benefits due to interconnection limitations and a need for additional \ntransmission capacity. Projects developed under the 2021 Northern Maine Energy Act are poised \nto address these longstanding challenges, bring jobs, tax revenue, and economic opportunities to \nnorthern Maine, and provide important improvements to system reliability and resiliency. In \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 64 of 108\n   \n \naddition, these projects aim to help reduce energy costs over the long-term by placing downward \npressure on regional electricity prices while also helping confront challenges from climate change \nby reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.  \n280.  In July 2023, Governor Mills signed “An Act Regarding the Procurement of \nOffshore  Wind  Energy  Resources”  into  law,  which  requires  procurement  of  at  least \n3000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040. P.L. 2023, Ch. 481. \n281.  Maine’s Energy Plan identifies offshore wind as a key energy generation source to \nhelp meet Maine’s long-term energy and reliability needs. Maine Energy Plan, supra. Responsible \nand sustainable development of offshore wind is essential to meet Maine’s growing electricity \ndemand as well as the state’s clean energy, climate, and economic development goals. Offshore \nwind is also identified as an important sector in the State’s 10-Year Economic Strategy. Maine \nDep’t  of  Econ.  and  Cmty.  Dev.,  Maine  Economic  Development  Strategy  (Nov.  15,  2019), \nhttps://perma.cc/CF9P-67YZ.  \n282.  ISO-NE has identified offshore wind as a key element in meeting the region’s \nenergy and reliability needs for a variety of reasons, including the ability to locate generators in \nclose proximity to large population hubs, which can help reduce strain on the transmission system. \nISO-NE found that es: “[a] large share of the region’s future offshore-wind production will likely \ncome from the Gulf of Maine lease area.” ISO-NE, 2050 Transmission Study: Offshore Wind \nAnalysis, at 9 (Mar. 21, 2025), https://perma.cc/TVN7-9KLW. Delaying offshore-wind projects \nwill have significant adverse impacts to Maine ratepayers and consumers in the entire region.  \n283.  Maine is also pursuing floating offshore wind energy. In August 2024, BOEM \nannounced the execution of the nation’s first floating offshore-wind energy research lease for the \nState of Maine. The lease area covers a little less than 15,000 acres located 28 nautical miles off \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 65 of 108\n   \n \nMaine on the Outer Continental Shelf and could allow for the deployment of up to 12 floating \noffshore wind turbines capable of generating up to 144 megawatts.  \n284.  Maine  is  unique  in  that  it  has  acquired  from  BOEM  its  own  offshore-wind \nleasehold, specifically, the Research Array leasehold, separate from the commercial leaseholds in \nthe Gulf of Maine. The Maine Research Array will advance the University of Maine’s patented \ntechnology; conduct important research to examine offshore wind’s effects on the Gulf of Maine \nfishing, wildlife, and ecosystem; and support economic development through the advancement of \nan offshore-wind supply chain and workforce. The Research Array project would be the first major \nfloating offshore-wind farm in the United States and would position Maine as a leader in this \nimportant technology. The GEO has been working with staff at the Maine PUC, the developer and \nthe state’s regulated utilities on a draft power purchase agreement. This effort was recently \nsuspended, however, at the request of the developer “due to recent shifts in the energy landscape \nthat have in particular caused uncertainty in the offshore-wind industry,” New England Aqua \nVentus, LLC, Procedural Order Suspending Negotiations, Me. Pub. Util. Comm’n Dkt. No. 2022-\n00100 (Mar. 28, 2025), particularly the Agency Defendants’ implementation of the Wind Directive.  \n285.  Separately, with respect to commercial offshore-wind development off the coast of \nMaine, after years of extensive stakeholder engagement and analysis, BOEM executed commercial \noffshore-wind leases in the Gulf of Maine in December 2024. In October 2024, the DOI announced \nthe results of the lease sale in the Gulf of Maine, which included two winners on four lease areas. \nInvenergy NE Offshore Wind, LLC, secured a lease that includes 97,854 developable acres and is \napproximately 46.2 nautical miles from Maine. Invenergy also won a southern lease that consists \nof 117,780 developable acres and is approximately 21.6 nautical miles from Massachusetts. \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 66 of 108\n   \n \nAvangrid Renewables, LLC, won two southern leases that each sit approximately 29.5 nautical \nmiles from Massachusetts, and include 98,565 and 124,897 developable acres, respectively.  \n286.  The Wind Directive and its implementation directly impact Maine’s ability to meet \nits statutory energy and climate goals. Onshore wind is the lowest cost clean energy resource \navailable, and Maine has the best regional wind potential. For example, the Wind Directive and its \nimplementation have directly and negatively impacted the collective work of the six New England \nstates and ISO-NE on transmission solutions to the region’s growing energy needs.  \n287.  The Wind Directive and its implementation also threaten the State’s ability to \neffectively implement its statutory requirements to begin its first commercial offshore-wind \nsolicitation in 2025. Further delays could threaten the state’s ability to achieve its statutory \nrequirement of procuring 3000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040. Moreover, the Wind Directive \nand its implementation threaten the ability to deliver low-cost onshore wind resources, as required \nby statute, in northern Maine. 35-A Me. Rev. Stat. § 3210-I.  \nMaryland \n288.  Offshore wind also figures into Maryland’s strategy to address climate change. The \nClimate Solutions Now Act of 2022 requires Maryland to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Md. \nCode. Env’t. § 2-1204.2. These requirements build on over a decade of state climate action, \ninvestments, and planning, all of which have specifically relied on developing offshore-wind \nresources.  \n289.  Maryland’s Offshore Wind Energy Act of 2013 set a statewide RPS of 25% by 2020 \nand created a carveout for offshore wind not to exceed 2.5% of the state’s electricity. The Clean \nEnergy Jobs Act, passed in 2019, increased the RPS to 50% by 2050, removed the 2.5% cap on \noffshore-wind electricity, and set a new goal of procuring at least 1,200 megawatts of offshore \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 67 of 108\n   \n \nwind through the issuance of offshore-wind renewable-energy credits. The Promoting Offshore \nWind Energy Resources (POWER) Act of 2023 further strengthened that goal by increasing the \nstate’s offshore-wind procurement goal to 8,500 megawatts by 2031 and also established new \nprocurement processes.  \n290.  The POWER Act of 2023 also required the state Public Service Commission to \nengage with Maryland’s regional grid manager (PJM) to study transmission models that would \nfacilitate the planned development of offshore-wind resources. That process is well underway. \n291.  There are currently three offshore-wind leaseholders in Maryland-adjacent waters. \nOne of those, the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, under development by U.S. Wind, received its \nfinal  Construction  and  Operation  Permit  in  late  2024.  U.S.  Wind’s  project  will  provide \n1,710 megawatts of clean energy from a maximum of 114 turbines sited approximately 11 to \n26 miles off the coast of Maryland. Upon information and belief, the company has spent over \n$280 million developing this project to date.  \n292.  The project is slated to create $6.2 billion in total economic benefit to the state, \nincluding over $1 billion in direct in-state expenditures. Those expenditures include significant \ninvestments in a Maryland steel fabrication plant planned for the site of the former Bethlehem \nSteel facility in Baltimore County; port improvement projects; and the construction of an in-state \ncable  facility. The  project  is  expected  to  create  13,600  direct  and  secondary  jobs  through \ndevelopment, construction, and operation. \n293.  Maryland has provided additional support to the offshore-wind industry through its \nOffshore Wind  Supply  Chain  Investment  Program  and  the Wind Workforce  and  Education \nProgram. The Supply Chain Investment program provides grant funding for businesses entering \nthe offshore wind supply chain in Maryland. Maryland provided $2 million for this program in \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 68 of 108\n   \n \nFiscal Year 2025. The Workforce and Education Program provides grant funding for workforce \ntraining centers and academic institutions to build programs that support the state’s offshore-wind \nworkforce. That program received $3 million in state funding for Fiscal Year 2025. \n294.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ actions indefinitely and categorically \nhalting wind-energy approvals threaten Maryland’s ability to achieve its statutory goals and \nexacerbate the harms Maryland is facing from climate change.  \nMichigan \n295.  Wind  energy  is  a crucial  resource in  Michigan’s  renewable  energy  planning. \nMichigan law, 2023 Mich. Pub. Act 235, requires that electric utilities operating in the state provide \n15% of electricity sales from renewable energy each year through 2029, increasing to 50% of \nelectricity sales for 2030, and then 60% in 2035 and thereafter. The law further requires that each \nutility supply 80% of electricity sales from 2035 through 2039, and 100% of electricity sales from \n2040 and thereafter, from renewable energy, nuclear, or natural gas with carbon capture and \nsequestration.  \n296.  Wind energy, a key wintertime resource, has a central role in meeting these \nrequirements. Wind also has the lowest cost per unit energy of any new resource type. \n297.  Michigan  currently  has  approximately  3,400  megawatts  of  land-based  wind \ngeneration, providing about 7% of Michigan’s electricity consumption. Michigan utilities plan to \ndevelop or acquire more than 6,560 megawatts of land-based wind generation by 2035, most of \nwhich is in the development process now or will be in the next three years. By 2035, wind \ngeneration will provide about 25% of Michigan’s electricity consumption. Given that wind has the \nlowest cost per unit energy among the resource types required by Mich. Pub. Act 235, additional \nwind development is expected in the period after 2035. \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 69 of 108\n   \n \n298.  Based on utility filings, projected wind development in Michigan will require \ninvestment of approximately $15 billion and is projected to save Michigan utility customers \napproximately $2.5 billion net present value through 2045 compared to using natural gas plants to \nprovide comparable electricity. It is anticipated that most of the 6,560 megawatts in planned wind \nprojects to be built will be required to apply for necessary permitting following federal reviews. \nAdditionally, as wind projects will be disincentivized due to regulatory uncertainty from the Wind \nDirective,  reducing  the  development  of  this  least-cost  renewable  resource  relative  to  other \nrenewable resources will raise the cost of coming into compliance with Mich. Pub. Act 235, as \nborne by Michigan ratepayers. \nMinnesota \n299.  Abundant wind-energy resources are important to achieving Minnesota’s emission-\nreduction goals and to the state’s economy. The 2023 Minnesota State Legislature adopted laws to \nreduce emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It also adopted a \ncarbon-free standard for Minnesota utilities. Minn. Stat. 216B.1691 (2024). Electricity generated \nor procured to serve Minnesota’s retail electricity customers must be 80% carbon free for public \nutilities and 60% carbon free for other electric utilities by 2030, 90% for all electric utilities by \n2035, and 100% for all electric utilities by 2040. Minn. Stat. § 216B.1691. \n300.  The Minnesota Climate Action Framework (Framework) aims for Minnesota to \nproduce 45% of total electricity generation from wind by 2034. The Framework also calls for \ntransitioning to an energy mix that is over 75% carbon-free by the same year. \n301.  Wind-energy generation is vital for Minnesota to meet its Framework and 2040 \nclimate  goals.  Wind  provides  the  largest  share  of  Minnesota’s  electricity  generation  from \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 70 of 108\n   \n \nrenewable resources. In 2023, wind energy accounted for more than 75% of the state’s renewable \ngeneration and 25% of the state’s total net generation, up from 22% in 2021.  \n302.   In 2023, Minnesota was among the ten states with the largest share of in-state \ngeneration from wind. Minnesota ranked eighth in the nation in wind capacity and accounted for \nmore than 3% of the U.S. total. Furthermore, wind is an important renewable-energy resource as \nMinnesota transitions away from reliance on fossil fuels. Wind energy represents a homegrown, \nreliable,  affordable,  and  clean  energy  resource  that  is  produced  entirely  in  Minnesota. \nTransitioning to wind energy allows Minnesota to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, thereby \nreducing the cost volatility associated with fossil fuels.  \n303.  Minnesota’s best wind resources are in the western and southern parts of the state. \nAccordingly, Minnesota’s wind farms are located primarily in rural, agricultural counties in \nwestern and southern Minnesota.  \n304.  Wind farms supplement income to these agricultural counties and communities. \nThis is so for three primary reasons: first, agricultural farming and wind farms work well together \nbecause wind turbines have a small footprint; second, the Minnesota production tax credit provides \nmoney to counties and townships based on wind generation; and third, landowners work with \ndevelopers to create wind projects and receive annual payments for hosting wind turbines. There \nis no eminent domain involved; willing private landowners develop these resources.  \n305.  Minnesota  has  over  50  operating,  repowered  (i.e.,  retrofitted  with  new  or \nrefurbished technology), permitted, in process, or expected wind-energy facilities, most of which \nare  permitted  through  the  Minnesota  Public  Utilities  Commission  and  have  undergone  an \nenvironmental review by, at the time of filing, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Energy \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 71 of 108\n   \n \nEnvironmental Review and Analysis. While most Minnesota wind farms are on private land, \nfacilities are sometimes subject to federal reviews and approvals. \n306.  Wind generation is important to Minnesota’s economy by furthering job creation, \nespecially  construction  jobs  in  rural  and  agricultural  communities.  The  Commission  and \nMinnesota Legislature have, in recent years, been supportive of the benefits of local labor for wind-\nenergy facilities, which, as stated, are generally located in rural and agricultural communities. The \ncommunities that support  wind farms  could lose production tax benefits and the economic \nopportunities that they create. \nNew Jersey \n307.  New Jersey has an extensive coastline, which is projected to experience higher sea-\nlevel rise than elsewhere, and a temperature that is rising faster than the rest of the Northeast \nregion. New Jersey has therefore taken legal steps to achieve greenhouse-gas-emission reductions, \nincluding by supporting offshore wind. New Jersey passed the Global Warming Response Act, N.J. \nStat. Ann. § 26:2C-40, which requires the State to achieve 80% reductions from 2006 greenhouse-\ngas emissions by 2050. As the power generation sector is the second largest greenhouse-gas \nemissions source in New Jersey, reducing power sector emissions is key to achieving these goals.  \n308.  In  2010,  the  New  Jersey  Legislature  enacted  the  Offshore  Wind  Economic \nDevelopment Act, P.L 2020, c.56, which authorized the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities \n(NJBPU) to conduct competitive solicitations to select proposed offshore-wind projects to receive \noffshore-wind renewable-energy credits in exchange for providing electricity to the New Jersey \nelectric grid. The goal of these solicitations was to enable a percentage of New Jersey’s electric \nload to be supplied by offshore-wind energy. \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 72 of 108\n   \n \n309.  By  2023,  after  a  series  of  executive  orders,  statutory  enactments  and  policy \nplanning documents, Governor Murphy increased New Jersey’s offshore-wind-generation goal \nfrom 7,500 megawatts by 2035 to 11,000 megawatts by 2040, Exec. Order No. 307 (Murphy) \n(Sept. 21, 2022), and accelerated the timeline for reaching New Jersey’s renewable-energy goal of \n100% clean energy from 2050 to 2035. \n310.  Three offshore wind projects have Outer Continental Shelf leases from BOEM and \nregulatory approvals from NJBPU to sell their electricity to the grid. The first is Atlantic Shores \nOffshore Wind Project 1, LLC’s (“Atlantic Shores”)  1,509.6 megawatt project, which has received \nall federal approvals. The other two are Invenergy Wind Offshore, LLC’s 2400-megawatt project \nand Attentive Energy, LLC’s 1,342 megawatt-project, neither of which has yet submitted a COP \nto BOEM. \n311.  NJBPU’s approval of offshore-wind-energy-generation projects enables the State \nto satisfy minimum statutory requirements related to the amount of offshore-wind New Jersey \nrelies upon as a source of electricity. New Jersey has also worked with PJM, New Jersey’s regional \ngrid manager, and FERC to award an electricity transmission project and commence a solicitation \nfor the award of a second transmission project, which are necessary to facilitate the introduction \nof electricity from offshore-wind-energy-generation projects into the State’s electricity grid. \n312.  Seven other projects have Outer Continental Shelf leases, but do not yet have the \nNJBPU approvals. There are other Outer Continental Shelf sites off New Jersey’s coast that BOEM \nhas considered for possible leasing. \n313.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on \nproject approvals threatens New Jersey’s ability to reach its statutory offshore-wind-energy-\ngeneration-procurement and greenhouse-gas emission-reduction requirements, N.J.S.A 48:3-87, \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 73 of 108\n   \n \nN.J.S.A. 26:2C-40, and risk wasting the significant State resources New Jersey has invested to \ndate in achieving those goals. \n314.   At the time the Wind Directive was issued, Atlantic Shores had received all \nfederally required permits.  In response to Atlantic Shores revised application for a Clean Air Act \npermit submitted on June 24, 2024, the EPA, granted the permit on September 30, 2024. This was \nthe last remaining federal permit the project needed. However, as described above, EPA moved to \nremand Atlantic Shores’ Clean Air Act permit to the agency, citing the Wind Directive as the basis \nfor the request. Notably, EPA’s remand motion followed full merits briefing in which EPA defended \nthe validity of the Clean Air Act permit on both substantive and procedural grounds. On March 14, \nthe Environmental Appeals Board granted EPA’s request. In re Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, \nLLC, OCS Appeal No. 24-01 (Mar. 14, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/5t364ez3. Atlantic Shores’ \nmotion to reconsider the remand was denied on April 15, 2025.   \n315.  On June 4, 2025, Atlantic Shores filed a petition with the NJBPU asking that the \nNJBPU vacate its prior approval for the project to sell its electricity to the grid. In re Petition \nAtlantic Shores of Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind Project 1, LLC Seeking Consent of the Board to \nSeek to Terminate the OREC Order in Connection with its 1,509.6 MW Qualified Offshore Wind \nProject, BPU Docket No. QO21050824 (June 3, 2025) (Petition).  Atlantic Shores indicated that \nits petition was prompted by the federal government’s inexplicable withdrawal of the critical Clean \nAir Act permit. As stated in its petition, “[w]ithout the Air Permit, [Atlantic Shores] cannot proceed \nwith construction of the project as a legal matter.” Petition ¶ 35. In addition, Atlantic Shores’ other \nfinalized and issued permits for that project are now at risk due to misalignment in permit \nconditions and timelines, even if the EPA later reissues the Clean Air Act permit. \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 74 of 108\n   \n \n316.  As stated in the petition, the “loss of the Air Permit significantly jeopardizes \nPetitioner’s funding and construction plans for the Project, which the federal government had \napproved to start as early as 2025.” Petition ¶ 35. As stated in the petition, as a result of the Wind \nMemorandum and the loss of the Clean Air Act permit and other actions taken by the current \nfederal administration, Atlantic Shores’ parent company has reduced Atlantic Shores’ personnel, \nterminated contracts and cancelled planned project investments.  The company had to ask to pause \nits construction schedule as there has been no indication when or if the essential Air Permit will be \nreinstated.  Atlantic Shores informed NJBPU that the project “is no longer viable under the terms \nand conditions” of its existing approval for sale of electricity to New Jersey’s grid. Id. ¶ 38.  \n317.  As stated in the petition, as a direct consequence of the Wind Directive, EPA \nreversed its position and withdrew Atlantic Shores’ Clean Air Act permit. Now that the permit has \nbeen remanded, the Wind Directive and EPA’s implementation of it stand in the way of a decision \non that permit within one year as required by 42 U.S.C. § 7475(c). As stated in the petition, a delay \nplaces Atlantic Shores’ other finalized and issued permits at risk due to potential misalignment in \npermit conditions and timelines.  \n318.  New Jersey will be financially harmed if Atlantic Shores’ project does not proceed. \nThe project includes a guarantee to spend $848 million during the development and construction \nphases of the project, which are expected to lead to a total $1.869 billion in direct, indirect, and \ninduced economic benefits into the New Jersey economy throughout the life of the project, \nincluding both construction-related and permanent jobs. The developer made other financial \ncommitments, including to invest tens of millions of dollars in the development of offshore-wind-\nrelated manufacturing facilities and leases and in offshore-wind-related workforce training and \ninnovation, business development, educational and community programs. In its application and as \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 75 of 108\n   \n \nrequired  by  NJBPU’s  order  approving  the  project,  Atlantic  Shores  committed  to  provide \ninfrastructure investments, commitments to public institutions, and commitments to community \ngroups and other initiatives. These commitments would be lost if the project is canceled.  While \nAtlantic Shores has satisfied some of its commitments, to the extent these commitments have not \nyet been satisfied, they would be lost if Atlantic Shores’ pending petition to vacate its NJBPU \napproval—itself a consequence of the Wind Directive and the loss of the Clean Air Act permit—\nis granted. Given Atlantic Shores’ indication that the project is currently unviable due to the loss \nof its Clean Air Act permit and the Wind Directive, the as yet unfunded financial benefits will at \nleast be delayed even if the project ultimately proceeds. \n319.  Economic benefits from other offshore wind projects will also be at risk if the \ncategorical halt continues.  Invenergy Wind Offshore, LLC’s project includes a guarantee to spend \n$1.7 billion dollars during the first ten years of operation, with an estimated total of $3.7 billion in \ndirect, indirect and induced economic benefits into the New Jersey economy throughout the life of \nthe project. Invenergy is required to pay a research and monitoring fee of $24 million to New \nJersey, which is to be dedicated to research initiatives and regional environment, wildlife, and \nfisheries monitoring initiatives for assessing the impacts of offshore-wind development on New \nJersey’s natural resources. The company made various other financial commitments, including \ncommitments to invest tens of millions of dollars in the development of offshore-wind-related \nmanufacturing facilities and leases, operations and maintenance facilities, and in offshore-wind-\nrelated workforce training and innovation, business development, and educational and community \nprograms. Invenergy’s investments in offshore-wind facilities are expected to directly create \nhundreds of permanent jobs and support 1,382 jobs during the design, permitting, and construction \nphases of the Invenergy Wind Offshore, LLC, project.  \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 76 of 108\n   \n \n320.  Similarly, Attentive Energy, LLC’s project includes a guarantee to spend $760 \nmillion during the first ten years of operation, and an estimated $3.1 billion in direct, indirect and \ninduced economic benefits into the New Jersey economy throughout the life of the project. The \ncompany is also required to pay New Jersey a research and monitoring fee of $15 million. Attentive \nEnergy, LLC, made other financial commitments, including commitments to invest tens of millions \nof  dollars  in  the  development  of  offshore-wind-related  manufacturing  facilities  and  leases, \noperations  and  maintenance  facilities,  and  in  offshore-wind-related  workforce  training  and \ninnovation,  business  development,  educational  and  community  programs.  The  company’s \ninvestments in offshore-wind facilities are expected to create hundreds of permanent jobs and \nsupport hundreds of jobs during design, permitting, and construction phases of the project.  \n321.  Offshore wind is critical to New Jersey’s long-term strategy to meet forecasted \ncapacity demands on the state’s electric grid using clean energy. By eliminating New Jersey’s \nability to rely upon offshore-wind energy as part of that strategy, the Wind Directive and resultant \nfederal  actions  make  execution  of  New  Jersey’s  current  plan,  reliant  upon  offshore  wind, \nimpossible. In addition, the need to develop a new plan without offshore wind delays New Jersey’s \nability to address climate change harms from power sector emissions. \n322.  Scarcity and congestion issues on New Jersey’s electrical grid will worsen without \noffshore-wind energy, leading to greater costs for electricity to both the State and its residents.  The \nneed for additional supply from offshore wind is critical because PJM’s forward-looking planning \nstudies already envision a worsening ratio of supply relative to demand—even when accounting \nfor 11,000 megawatts of offshore wind in New Jersey beginning in the early 2030s. Demand for \nelectricity is currently outpacing supply on the regional grid as rapidly increasing electricity \nconsumption (known as “load growth”) outpaces the addition of new generation. New Jersey’s \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 77 of 108\n   \n \nplan of adding 11,000 megawatts of offshore-wind-energy generation by 2040, including the three \nNJBPU approved projects and as-yet unapproved projects on existing BOEM leases, would ease \nthis problem by increasing available supply. Delay or loss of that generation would exacerbate the \nforecasted electricity supply problem, which also does not account for increasing demand from \ndata centers and artificial intelligence. \n323.  The northeast portion of the PJM grid, in which New Jersey is located, also suffers \nfrom rising annual congestion costs. From 2021 to 2022 alone, congestion costs rose from $995 \nmillion to $2.5 billion. When the transmission system is congested, the most efficient source of \nelectricity is not used, and the area with remaining electricity demand is served from alternative, \nless efficient, and more expensive sources of supply.  \n324.  New Jersey’s offshore-wind generation would complement the west-to-east supply \nof electricity, while also serving as an alternative source of  electricity that would increase \nreliability and resilience for the PJM grid. New Jersey’s planned offshore-wind generation and \ntransmission development would ease congestion and reduce costs by creating an additional source \nof electricity supply close to, and to the east of, areas with significant demand. Savings would \nultimately be passed on to ratepayers, including the State.  \n325.  The cancellation of any NJBPU approved project would require the NJBPU to \nconduct additional solicitations to reach the State’s offshore wind and clean energy goals and \nsupport the development of needed electric generation capacity in the PJM region, which would \ncause the State to incur additional costs in the form of staff time and consultant fees. \nNew Mexico \n326.  Wind energy is important to New Mexico’s environmental and economic goals. \nWith the lowest water-to-land ratio of all fifty states, New Mexico is particularly susceptible to \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 78 of 108\n   \n \ndrought conditions caused by climate change. Like many other states that are bearing the brunt of \nthese impacts, New Mexico committed its public utilities to zero-carbon energy production by \n2045. See N.M. Stat. Ann. § 62-16-4(A)(6); N.M. Code R. 17.9.572.10(B)(6). New Mexico is \ncurrently on track to meet these goals: in 2024’s third quarter, New Mexico’s renewable electricity \ngeneration reached 49% of total electric sales, which exceeds the statutory portfolio requirement \nthat at least 40% of public utility retail sales comprise renewable energy sources by January 1, \n2025. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 62-16-4(A)(3).  \n327.  New Mexico’s ability to harness its strong wind-power potential is vitally important \nto its zero-carbon energy-production goals and to its economy. Wind produced 38% of New \nMexico’s in-state generated power in 2023. Based on data for 2024’s first quarter, New Mexico \nranks eighth in wind capacity. In 2023, New Mexico generated a net total of 39,269,000 megawatt \nhours, of which 14,915,000 megawatt hours were produced by wind. In 2024, New Mexico \ngenerated 40,148,000 megawatt hours, of which 15,285,000 were generated by wind.  Wind power \nfar outstrips any other source of renewable energy production in New Mexico. In part because of \nits strong wind-power assets, New Mexico is a net exporter of electricity. \n \n328.  Approximately 250,000 acres of New Mexico state lands are currently leased for \nwind projects that are not yet operational. Some of these projects still need federal permits, which \nthe Wind Directive promises to delay or halt. Agency actions implementing the Wind Directive \nwill endanger these projects and likely impact state-lands leasing revenue in the future. \n329.  Several renewable energy transmission projects are currently under development in \nNew Mexico. The Wind Directive’s order to agencies to pause the issuance or renewal of federal \nrights of way poses a threat to at least one of these transmission projects. \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 79 of 108\n   \n \n330.  The Wind Directive’s chilling effect will deter investment in New Mexico’s wind \npower and delay its ability to reach its capacity for wind-powered energy generation and export. \nOregon \n331.  The Wind Directive and the Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on \nproject approvals threaten Oregon’s ability to develop least-cost, large-scale electricity generating \nresources to meet rapidly increasing industrial, commercial, and residential demand for power. \nThe halt also threatens Oregon’s ability to reach its statutory clean electricity and economy-wide \nprocurement and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions-reduction requirements. \n332.  Oregon is committed to meeting its energy needs with wind energy and other \nrenewable energy sources. Oregon law requires Oregon’s investor-owned electric utilities to \nreduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 80% below baseline levels by 2030 and to zero by 2040. Or. \nRev. Stat. § 469A.410(1)(a)-(c) (2023). \n333.  Oregon’s RPS incentivizes the use of new renewable resources like wind and solar. \nAt least 27% of electricity sold by “large” investor-owned utilities (e.g., PacifiCorp and Portland \nGeneral Electric Company) to retail electricity consumers located in Oregon must come from \nqualifying renewable resources, and that requirement gradually increases to 50% by 2040. Or. Rev. \nStat. § 469A.052(1)(e)-(h) (2023). Large consumer-owned utilities (e.g., the Eugene Water & \nElectric Board) must ensure that at least 25% of the electricity they sell to retail electricity \nconsumers  located  in  Oregon  comes  from  qualifying  renewable  resources  by  2025  and  in \nsubsequent calendar years. Or. Rev. Stat. § 469A.052(d) (2023). And for “small” electric utilities, \nthey must ensure that at least five percent of the electricity they sell to retail customers comes from \nqualifying renewable resources starting in 2025 and in subsequent calendar years. Or. Rev. Stat. \n§ 469A.055(2) (2023). \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 80 of 108\n   \n \n334.  As of 2022, Oregon had 50 operating wind-energy facilities in the state with a total \ncapacity of 3,981 megawatts. Wind energy produced 8.8 megawatts of total electricity in 2020 and \n8.2 megawatts in Oregon in 2022. Wind energy accounted for 12.6% of Oregon’s primary energy \nproduction and 13.3% of electricity generated in Oregon in 2022. \n335.  Oregon continues to develop and site new wind-energy facilities, including hybrid \nenergy facilities that include a wind-energy component. In 2023, for example, the Oregon Energy \nFacility Siting Council (EFSC) approved the Nolin Hills Wind Power Project, a wind and solar \nenergy generation facility with a nominal generating capacity of approximately 600 megawatts \n(340 megawatts from wind and 260 megawatts from solar).  \n336.  Offshore wind is another major potential source of energy in Oregon. The National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory estimates that Oregon has the technical potential for 62 gigawatts \nof offshore-wind electricity generation capacity. The Oregon Department of Land Conservation \nhas initiated a multiyear Offshore Wind Energy Roadmap process to define the standards to be \nconsidered for offshore-wind energy development and approval, including supporting effective \nstakeholder engagement; consideration of input of coastal communities; support of sustainable \nlocal  and  regional  economic  opportunities  and  workforce;  protection  of  tribal  cultural  and \narchaeological resources; protection of culturally significant viewsheds and other interests of \nNative American tribes; protection of the environment and marine species; and achievement of \nstate energy and climate policy objectives, including energy resource diversity, reliability and \nresilience of state and regional energy systems. 2024 Or. Laws Ch. 31 § 3. \n337.  The wind-energy power generation sector provided 1,633 jobs in Oregon in 2022, \nan increase of 149 jobs from 2020.  \n \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 81 of 108\n   \n \nRhode Island \n338.  Rhode Island has a long history of supporting development of wind power. The \nstate successfully developed and permitted the 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm in state and \nfederal waters in the 2010s. The Block Island Wind Farm became operational in the fall of 2016, \nmaking it the nation’s first commercial offshore wind farm. \n339.   As of 2024, Rhode Island’s clean-energy portfolio included 148 megawatts of \nonshore wind and 430 megawatts of offshore wind from projects that are operational or awarded \ncontracts and working toward operation. \n340.  Rhode Island is set to receive 400 megawatts of energy from Revolution Wind. As \noutlined above, that project will also provide power for Connecticut and is expected to be \ncompleted and generate electricity in 2026. \n341.  As also noted above, Rhode Island is also expected to receive 200 megawatts of \noffshore wind from Ocean Winds’s SouthCoast Wind project, which will also provide power for \nMassachusetts. \n342.  Rhode Island is committed to combatting climate change and its harmful impacts. \nTo that end, the 2021 Act on Climate sets aggressive decarbonization requirements for the \nState. See R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 42-6.2-1, et seq. This includes mandates that statewide greenhouse-\ngas emissions reach 45% below 1990 levels by 2030; 80% below 1990 levels by 2040, and net-\nzero emissions by 2050. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-9 (2021).  \n343.  Additionally, Rhode Island’s Renewable Energy Standard (RI RES) requires retail \nelectricity sales in the state to include increasing renewable energy each year, ultimately reaching \n100% renewable energy by 2033. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-26-4 (2022).  \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 82 of 108\n   \n \n344.  In passing the RI RES, Rhode Island’s legislature found, inter alia, that “[i]t is in \nthe interest of the people, in order to protect public health and the environment and to promote the \ngeneral welfare, to establish a renewable energy standard program to increase levels of electrical \nenergy supplied in the state from renewable resources [including wind].” R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-26-\n1(5) (2024).  \n345.  The express purpose of the RI RES is to “to facilitate the development of new \nrenewable energy resources to supply electricity to customers in Rhode Island with goals of \nstabilizing long-term energy prices, enhancing environmental quality, and creating jobs in Rhode \nIsland in the renewable energy sector.” R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-26-3 (2024).  \n346.  Per  its Affordable  Clean  Energy  Security Act  (RI ACES),  “Rhode  Island  is \ncommitted to the increased use of no- and low-carbon energy resources that diversify our energy \nsupply portfolio, provide affordable energy to consumers, and strengthen our shared quality of life \nand environment, and new energy infrastructure investments may help facilitate the development \nand interconnection of these resources[.]” R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-31-1 (2014). \n347.  In June 2022, the state amended RI ACES to support procurement of between 600 \nto 1,000 megawatts of offshore-wind capacity for Rhode Island. R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-31-10 (2022). \n348.  By introducing regulatory uncertainty in the development of new onshore wind and \noffshore wind, the Wind Directive harms Rhode Island in numerous ways.  \n349.  The Wind Directive and its implementation undermine Rhode Island’s ability to \nprocure additional energy from onshore and offshore-wind generation to meet the state’s energy \nand environmental requirements, including statutory requirements to reduce statewide greenhouse-\ngas emissions and reach net-zero by 2050, and to attain 100% renewable energy by 2033. As a \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 83 of 108\n   \n \nresult, the Wind Directive also harms Rhode Island’s ability to protect its residents, as part of a \nbroader effort, from the growing impacts of climate change.  \n350.  As outlined above, delaying or preventing development of new wind energy in the \nregion prevents New England states, including Rhode Island, from bringing new energy resources \nonline that are important to ensure a reliable grid and cleaner renewable energy, and to combat the \nprice volatility related to continued reliance on fossil fuels in the region.  \nWashington \n351.  The  Wind  Directive  and  the  Agency  Defendants’  indefinite  halt  on  project \napprovals could threaten Washington’s ability to meet its greenhouse-gas emissions requirements \nand renewable energy goals. It also threatens the existence of the wind industry, which is an \nincreasingly important part of Washington’s economy. \n352.  In 2019, Washington enacted the Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA). CETA \ncommits Washington to an electricity supply free of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2045. Wash. \nRev. Code § 19.405.010 (2019). \n353.  In 2021, Washington enacted the Climate Commitment Act (CCA). In combination \nwith a market-based cap-and-invest program and other policies, the CCA sets Washington on the \npath to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions 95% by 2050. Wash. Rev. Code § 70A.45.020 (2021). \n354.  Wind power has been and will continue to be a vital tool for Washington to meet its \nclimate and renewable-energy goals. Washington is third in the nation in utility-scale renewable-\nenergy  generation  from  all  sources,  and  wind  power  is  the  second  largest  contributor  to \nWashington’s  renewable-energy  generation  after  hydroelectric  power.  In  2024,  Washington \ngenerated 8,421 megawatt-hours from wind power alone.  \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 84 of 108\n   \n \n355.  Washington has recently authorized the construction of the 1,150-megawatt Horse \nHeaven Wind Farm Project through its Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, which will further \nenhance Washington’s wind power energy portfolio when construction is finished.  \n356.  Wind  power  is  one  of  the  most  promising  sources  of  renewable  energy  for \nWashington. It is an abundant and sustainable energy source that does not produce any greenhouse-\ngas emissions. In contrast to fossil fuels, which are often subject to volatile market conditions, \nwind power enhances Washington’s energy security and economic stability.  \n357.  Wind  power  helps  boost  the  Washington  economy  by  creating  jobs  in \nmanufacturing, installation, and maintenance. Developers in Washington are exploring innovative \ndual use approaches to minimize any disruption to agricultural productivity and traditional land \nuses while providing new economic opportunities for Washingtonians. \n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act - 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n(Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n(Against Agency Defendants) \n358.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs. \n359.  Agency  Defendants  are  “agenc[ies]”  under  the Administrative  Procedure Act \n(APA). 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1). \n360.  Agency  Defendants  have  adopted  and  implemented  the  Wind  Directive’s \ncategorical and indefinite halt on approvals through numerous actions beginning on January 20, \n2025, and continuing to the present. See supra ¶¶ 142–58.  \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 85 of 108\n   \n \n361.  Each Agency Defendant’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive \nconstitutes final agency action. See 5 U.S.C. § 704. Specifically, the adoption and implementation \nof the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects \n“mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and is an action “from which \nlegal consequences will flow.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78 (internal quotations omitted).  \n362.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found \nto be . . . arbitrary [or] capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n363.  An  agency  action  is  arbitrary  or  capricious  where  it  is  not  “reasonable  and \nreasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). An agency \nmust provide “a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a rational connection between the \nfacts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).  \n364.  Additionally, agencies must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, \nreasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019). Agencies may not rely on explanations that are “contrived” or \n“incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking \nprocess.” Id.  \n365.  Further, when an agency changes its existing policy, it must “display awareness that \nit is changing position” and “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.” FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (emphasis in original). An agency must provide \n“a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate” \nwhen “its new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior \npolicy.”  Id.  An  “unexplained  inconsistency  in  agency  policy  is  a  reason  for  holding  an \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 86 of 108\n   \n \ninterpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.” Encino Motorcars, \nLLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 222 (2016) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \n366.  Agencies also must provide a more detailed justification “when [their] prior policy \nhas engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” Fox, 556 U.S. at 515. \n367.  Here,  Agency  Defendants  provided  no  reasoned  basis  for  adopting  and \nimplementing the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals. Nor did they \nprovide any justification acknowledging or reconciling their stark departure from past agency \npolicy  on  wind  energy  development,  prior  findings  regarding  impacts  of  wind  energy,  the \nsignificant reliance interests that have developed based on that prior policy, or the inconsistencies \nwith contemporaneous Executive actions emphasizing the need for and promoting domestic energy \ndevelopment while curtailing review for non-wind domestic energy sources.  \n368.  First, the only explanation provided by Agency Defendants for indefinitely and \ncategorically halting wind approvals—that they are implementing the Wind Directive—does not \nconstitute a reasoned explanation because the Wind Directive itself lacks reasoned explanation.  \n369.  Specifically, the Wind Directive cites “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the \nFederal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects” and alleged \n“potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363. Neither the Wind \nDirective nor Agency Defendants have pointed to any alleged legal deficiencies or inadequacies \nthat could justify the categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects. Nor \ncould they, as prior to the issuance of the Wind Directive, Agency Defendants followed the \nnumerous  statutory  authorities  governing  wind-energy-project  reviews  and  approvals  and \nsuccessfully defended such reviews and approvals in courts.  \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 87 of 108\n   \n \n370.  Similarly, although the Wind Directive alleges that wind-energy development risks \n“negative  impacts  on  navigational  safety  interests,  transportation  interests,  national  security \ninterests, commercial interests, and marine mammals,” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8363, it fails to cite any \nspecific risk or factual basis that could warrant the categorical and indefinite halt—nor could it, \ngiven Agency Defendants’ comprehensive reviews and findings regarding such risks and available \nmitigation. Tellingly, even the vaguely described scope of the “assessment” ordered in the Wind \nDirective does not include all of these purported “negative impacts” from wind projects. \n371.  Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on project approvals marks a \nstark departure from the federal government’s longstanding, bipartisan policy of encouraging \nwind-energy development and fails to provide any factual findings or explanation regarding its \ndeparture from the findings that underlay its prior policy, much less provide “a more detailed \njustification” to explain any such conflicting findings.  \n372.  Indeed,  past  Presidential  administrations  have  repeatedly  supported  the \ndevelopment of offshore- and onshore-wind energy.  \n373.  Agency Defendants have repeatedly assessed wind-energy development and found \nno impacts warranting denial of approvals under relevant authorities.  \n374.  By  way  of  example,  the  Wind  Directive’s  purported  need  to  consider  the \nenvironmental impact of wind projects on marine mammals ignores prior agency studies and \nfindings that have examined marine-mammal impacts generally, as well as individual permits that \nhave included mitigation measures to alleviate impacts on marine mammals.  \n375.  As  another  example,  the  Wind  Directive’s  claim  of  threats  to  “commercial \ninterests” ignores the fact that the economic impacts of wind energy have been extensively studied, \nboth generally and with regard to specific projects.  \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 88 of 108\n   \n \n376.  Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on project approvals also fails \nto account for the significant reliance interests that the States and other stakeholders have formed \nbased on Agency Defendants’ policies and decisions supporting and approving wind-energy \ndevelopment.  \n377.  For example, States have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to create state-\nof-the-art facilities capable of accommodating wind turbine construction; relied on predictable \npermitting processes to bring online wind resources that will boost reliability and affordability to \nalleviate burdens associated with increasing  energy demand; invested  in supply chains and \nworkforce training programs with the expectation that jobs and economic stimulus will accompany \nwind industry development; and relied on wind energy to alleviate the negative impacts of climate \nchange and public health harms associated with fossil-fueled energy generation. \n378.  Agency Defendants’ halt on approvals of wind-energy projects altogether failed to \naccount for the States’ reliance interests.   \n379.  Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy \nprojects  is  also  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  it  reflects  significant  “unexplained \ninconsistenc[ies]” with the federal government’s current policy toward the development of energy \nresources in the United States. Encino Motorcars, 579 U.S. at 222. \n380.  In adopting and implementing the Wind Directive, Agency Defendants have failed \nto explain the inconsistencies between the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on \nfederal approvals of wind-energy projects until completion of an extra-statutory assessment and \nnumerous other Executive Orders issued on the same day and since, as well as agency actions \nimplementing  those  Executive  Orders,  that  emphasize  a  need  for  and  direct  the  expedited \ndevelopment or continued operation of domestic energy resources, including (i) the Energy \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 89 of 108\n   \n \nEmergency Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433, (ii) the Unleashing Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, and (iii) the \nGrid Reliability Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,521.  \n381.  Nor have Agency Defendants explained the inconsistencies between the Wind \nDirective’s categorical and indefinite halt on federal approvals of wind-energy projects until \ncompletion of an extra-statutory assessment and multiple contemporaneously or subsequently \nissued Executive Orders that direct the expedited review of or relaxed standards for other domestic \nenergy resources, including (i) the Energy Emergency Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (and Agency \nDefendants’ expedition of permits in reliance on it); (ii) the Reinvigorating Coal Order, 90 Fed. \nReg. 15,517; (iii) the Zero-Based Budgeting Order, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,643, (iv) Exec. Order 14153, \nUnleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential, 90 Fed. Reg. 8347 (Jan. 29, 2025); and \n(v) Proclamation 10914 of Apr. 8, 2025, Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to \nPromote  American  Energy,  90  Fed.  Reg.  16,777  (Apr.  21,  2025);  cf.  Exec.  Order  14285, \nUnleashing America’s Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources, 90 Fed. Reg. 17,735 (Apr. 24, \n2025). \n382.  Finally, Agency Defendants have failed to explain their implementation of the \nEnergy Emergency Order’s edict to use “all lawful emergency or other authorities available” to \nexpedite  non-wind-energy  development  in  the  Northeastern  and  West  Coast  States  while \nimplementing  the  Wind  Directive  by  categorically  and  indefinitely  halting  wind-energy \ndevelopment in those very same states. \n383.  Because  Agency  Defendants  failed  to  explain  these  inconsistencies,  their \nimplementation of the Wind Directive is arbitrary and capricious. \n384.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a \ndeclaration that the Agency Defendants’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive to \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 90 of 108\n   \n \ncategorically and indefinitely halt approvals of wind-energy projects violates the APA because it \nis arbitrary and capricious. \n385.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706, the States are entitled to vacatur of Agency Defendants’ \nadoption and implementation of the Wind Directive to categorically and indefinitely halt approvals \nof wind-energy projects, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing Agency \nDefendants from implementing the Wind Directive, including taking any action(s) to impede wind-\nenergy development in reliance, in whole or in part, on the Wind Directive. \nCOUNT II \nAdministrative Procedure Act - 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \n(Agency Action Contrary to Law and In Excess of Authority) \n(Against Agency Defendants) \n \n386.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs. \n387.  Under the APA, a reviewing court must set aside a challenged agency action that is \nfound to be, inter alia, “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” id. § 706(2)(C). \n388.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might \notherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 391 (2024) (quoting United States v. Morton Salt, \n338 U.S. 632, 644 (1950)).  \n389.  An agency thus may not take any action that exceeds the scope of its statutory \nauthority.  \n390.  Each Agency Defendant’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive to \ncategorically and indefinitely halt approvals of wind-energy projects is final agency action as it \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 91 of 108\n   \n \nmarks the consummation of the agency’s decision-making process and is an action from which \nlegal consequences flow. See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78. \n391.  Because  Agency  Defendants  have  disregarded  the  specific  substantive  and \nprocedural requirements of laws and regulations governing processing of federal permitting and \napprovals of wind energy, by categorically and indefinitely halting approvals of wind-energy \nprojects without regard for applicable law, and because they have done so pending an extra-\nstatutory review grounded in no statute, Agency Defendants have acted contrary to law and in \nexcess of their authority. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), 706(2)(C).  \n392.  Specifically, none of the statutory authorities governing federal approvals of wind-\nenergy development—including, but not limited to, OCSLA, the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and \nHarbors Act, the Clean Air Act, NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle \nProtection Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, FLPMA, and the Fixing America’s \nSurface Transportation Act—authorizes the Wind Memo’s categorical and indefinite halt on wind-\nenergy-project approvals implemented by Agency Defendants. To the contrary, each such authority \nand its implementing regulations contemplates comprehensive, but prompt, review and decision \npursuant to specific approval procedures and standards.  \n393.  For  example,  DOI  and  BOEM’s  adoption  and  implementation  of  the  Wind \nDirective for offshore-wind-energy projects are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority \nunder OCSLA. 43 U.S.C. §§ 1331 et seq. OCSLA does not grant agency officials authority to \nindefinitely cease permitting for particular types of projects, such as wind energy. Id. Instead, \nOCSLA requires the “expeditious and orderly development” of Outer Continental Shelf resources. \n43 U.S.C. § 1332(3). BOEM’s regulations in turn require that, “[u]pon completion of [BOEM’s] \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 92 of 108\n   \n \ntechnical and environmental reviews and other reviews required by Federal laws (e.g., CZMA), \nBOEM will approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions” an offshore-wind project’s site \nassessment and construction and operations plans. 30 C.F.R. §§ 585.613(e), 585.628(f)(emphasis \n \nadded).  \n394.  By  categorically  and  indefinitely  halting  permitting  for  wind-energy  projects \npending a new, extra-statutory review not required by federal laws, DOI and BOEM also have \nacted in excess  of statutory authority under  and contrary to  OCSLA and its implementing \nregulations.  \n395.  The Corps’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive likewise are \ncontrary to and in excess of statutory authority under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 33 U.S.C. \n§ 1344. Section 404 does not grant the Corps authority to cease permitting and authorizations for \nparticular types of projects, such as wind energy. Id. To the contrary, Section 404 mandates that \nthe Corps minimize permitting delays, requiring decisions on a dredge-and-fill permit application \n“to the maximum extent practicable . . . not later than the ninetieth day after the date the notice for \nsuch application is published.” Id. § 1344(q).  \n396.  Corps  regulations  provide  specific  steps  and  timelines  to  implement  that \ninstruction, 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(a), and require that its “district engineers will decide on all \napplications not later than 60 [calendar] days after receipt of a complete application,” with \nexceptions irrelevant here, id. § 325.2(d)(3). Moreover, the Corps’s regulations classify wind and \nother energy related projects as “major national objectives” and direct that “[d]istrict engineers \nwill give high priority to the processing of permit actions involving energy projects” and to \npromptly  process  permit  applications  and  issue  permit  decisions.  33  C.F.R.  §  320.4(n).  \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 93 of 108\n   \n \nAdditionally, the Corps’s regulations provide specific substantive criteria that apply to permitting \ndecisions. See, e.g., 33 C.F.R. §§ 322.5, 323.6(a). \n397.  By  indefinitely  and  categorically  halting  permitting  for  wind-energy  projects \nwithout regard for those procedures or any standards applicable to permit review under Section \n404, the Corps has abdicated its clear mandate to administer the Clean Water Act Section 404 \npermitting program and violated 33 U.S.C. § 1344 and Section 404’s implementing regulations at \n33 C.F.R. §§ 322.5; 323.6(a); 325.2(a), (d)(3); 320.4(n). \n398.  EPA’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive are also contrary to and \nin excess of statutory authority under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. 33 U.S.C. § 1342.  Under \nSection 402, EPA or a state agency with delegated NPDES permitting authority must determine \nwithin 30 days whether the application is complete and thereafter prepare a draft permit and solicit \npublic comment before issuing a final permit. 40 C.F.R. §§ 124.3(c); 124.10(a); 124.11–124.12. \n399.  By indefinitely and categorically halting permitting for wind-energy projects, the \nCorps has abdicated its clear mandate to administer the Clean Water Act NPDES permitting \nprogram and violated 40 C.F.R. §§ 124.3(c); 124.10(a); 124.11–124.12. \n400.  The Corps’s actions also are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority under \nthe Rivers and Harbors Act. 33 U.S.C. §§ 403, 408. Sections 10 and 14 of the Act do not grant the \nCorps authority to cease processing or issuing permit decisions for particular types of projects, \nsuch as wind energy. Id. For individual Section 10 permits, the Corps must, among other things, \nnotify applicants of incomplete applications within 15 calendar days; issue public notice within \n15 days of receipt of a complete application; and decide applications within 60 days, unless \nadditional information is needed. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2. Moreover, the Corps’s regulations require the \nCorps to timely process permit applications and issue permits. Id. §§ 320.4(n), 325.2. And the \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 94 of 108\n   \n \nCorps’s regulations provide specific substantive criteria that apply to permitting decisions. See id. \n§ 322.5. \n401.  By categorically and indefinitely halting permitting for wind-energy projects, the \nCorps has abdicated its clear mandate to administer the River and Harbors Act permitting program \nand violated 33 C.F.R. §§ 320.4(n), 325.2, 322.5. \n402.  EPA’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive are also contrary to and \nin excess of statutory authority under the Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C. § 7627. The Act does not grant \nEPA officials authority to cease permitting for particular types of projects, such as wind energy. Id. \nThe Clean Air Act requires permitting authorities to issue permit decisions within one year of \nreceiving an application for a Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit and within 18 months \nof receiving an application for a Nonattainment New Source Review permit. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7475(c), \n7661b(c). EPA’s regulations set additional timelines. 40 C.F.R. § 71.5(a)(2).  \n403.  By categorically and indefinitely halting permitting for wind-energy projects, EPA \nhas abdicated its clear mandate to administer the Clean Air Act permitting program and violated \n42 U.S.C. §§ 7475(c), 7661b(c) and 40 C.F.R. § 71.5(a)(2).  \n404.  Agency Defendants’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive are also \ncontrary to and in excess of statutory authority under NEPA. 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. Under \nNEPA, as amended by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, lead agencies “shall complete” the required \nenvironmental assessments not later than one year after certain conditions are met, and “shall \ncomplete” required environmental impact statements not later than two years after those conditions \nare met. 42 U.S.C. § 4336a(g). \n94 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 95 of 108\n   \n \n405.  By categorically and indefinitely halting NEPA reviews for wind-energy projects, \nAgency  Defendants  have  abdicated  their  clear  mandates  to  administer  NEPA  and  violated \n42 U.S.C. § 4336a(g).  \n406.  The Services’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive are contrary to \nand in excess of statutory authority under the Endangered Species Act. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531 et seq. \nThe Act does not authorize USFWS or NMFS to stop engaging in or foreclose completion of \nconsultation for particular types of projects, such as wind energy. Furthermore, USFWS and NMFS \nregulations  require  those  agencies  to  engage  in  and  timely  complete  consultation. \n50 C.F.R. Part 13; id. Part 17; id. Part 222; id. § 402.14(e). NMFS is directed to issue permits \nunless certain conditions are not met, id. § 222.303(e)(1) (“shall issue the permit unless . . .”), and \nprocess permit applications “in the shortest possible time.” Id. § 222.302(b). \n407.  By categorically and indefinitely halting permitting for wind-energy projects, the \nServices have abdicated their clear mandates to administer the Endangered Species Act and \nviolated 50 C.F.R. §§ 222.302(b), 222.303(e)(1). \n408.  USFWS’s actions also are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority under the \nBald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. 16 U.S.C. § 668. The Act does not authorize USFWS to \nstop issuing incidental-take authorizations for particular types of projects, such as wind energy. Id. \nThe Act and USFWS’s regulations instead direct the USFWS to process “all applications as \nquickly as possible.” 50 C.F.R. § 13.11(c). \n409.  By adopting and implementing the Wind Directive, USFWS has abdicated its clear \nmandate to administer the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and violated 50 C.F.R. § 13.11(c). \n410.  The Services’ actions also are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority under \nthe Marine Mammal Protection Act. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1371 et seq. The Act as well as USFWS and \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 96 of 108\n   \n \nNMFS regulations direct the Services to process permit applications “as quickly as possible.” \n50 C.F.R. § 13.11(c).  \n411.  By adopting and implementing the Wind Directive, the Services have abdicated \ntheir clear mandates to administer the Marine Mammal Protection Act and violated 50 C.F.R. \n§ 13.11(c).  \n412.  DOI and BLM’s adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive for onshore-\nwind-energy projects are contrary to and in excess of statutory authority under FLPMA. 43 U.S.C. \n§§ 1701 et seq. FLPMA does not grant agency officials authority to altogether cease issuing right-\nof-way decisions for particular types of projects, such as wind energy, and instead enumerates \nspecific bases that allow BLM to deny a right-of-way application request. 43 C.F.R. § 2804.26. \nMoreover, BLM’s regulations have specific provisions that authorize “the prioritization [of] solar \nand wind development rights-of-way,” indicating an intention that BLM should promptly process \nrights-of-way. 43 C.F.R. § 2804.35. Finally, BLM’s regulations provide that one of the core \nobjectives of the right-of-way program is to “[p]romote[] the use of rights-of-way in common \nwherever practical, considering engineering and technological compatibility, national security, and \nland use plans[.]” 43 C.F.R. § 2801.2(c). \n413.  By indefinitely and categorically halting permitting for wind-energy projects, BLM \nhas abdicated its clear mandate to administer the FLPMA right-of-way program and violated \n43 C.F.R. §§ 2804.26, 2804.35, 2801.2. \n414.  The adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite \nhalt on approvals of wind-energy projects by each of these Agency Defendants thus are “not in \naccordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \n96 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 97 of 108\n   \n \nlimitations, or short of statutory right,” id. § 706(2)(C), and accordingly violate the APA as well as \nthe statutory and regulatory provisions cited above. \n415.  Furthermore, adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive’s categorical and \nindefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects by each of these Agency Defendants is \ncontrary to APA Section 558, which requires approval applications to be processed within a \n“reasonable time,” 5 U.S.C. § 558(c); cf. id. § 554(b), and for that reason, as well, is “not in \naccordance with law,” id. § 706(2)(A). \n416.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a \ndeclaration that adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite \nhalt on approvals of wind-energy projects by each of the Agency Defendants violates APA \nSections 706(2)(A) and (C). \n417.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706, the States are entitled to vacatur of the Agency \nDefendants’ adoption of the Wind Directive to categorically and indefinitely halt approvals of \nwind-energy projects, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing Agency \nDefendants from implementing the Wind Directive, including taking any action(s) to impede wind-\nenergy development in reliance, in whole or in part, on the Wind Directive. \nCOUNT III \nEquitable Claim for Violations of Federal Law by Federal Officials  \n(Against Agency Defendants) \n \n418.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs.  \n419.  Federal courts also possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n575 U.S. 320, 326–27 (2015).  \n97 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 98 of 108\n   \n \n420.  As set out above, supra ¶¶ 386-415, Agency Defendants have violated the statutes \ngoverning permits and approvals for wind-energy development by adopting and implementing the \nWind Directive to categorically and indefinitely halt approvals of wind-energy projects. \n421.  These statutes include, but are not limited to, OCSLA, the Clean Water Act, the \nRivers and Harbors Act, the Clean Air Act, NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, the Bald and \nGolden Eagle Protection Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, FLPMA, and the \nFixing America’s Surface Transportation Act. \n422.  By adopting and implementing the Wind Directive to indefinitely and categorically \nhalt permits and approvals for wind-energy projects, Agency Defendants have violated these \nstatutes, which, along with their regulations, require comprehensive, but prompt, review and \ndecision pursuant to specific approval procedures, supra ¶¶ 386–415. \n423.  Because the Agency Defendants are violating the statutes governing wind-energy \npermitting and approvals, the States are entitled to equitable relief in the form of a preliminary and \npermanent injunction preventing Agency Defendants from implementing the Wind Directive, \nincluding taking any action(s) to impede wind-energy development in reliance, in whole or in part, \non the Wind Directive.  \nCOUNT IV \nCommon Law Ultra Vires – Conduct Outside the Scope of \nStatutory Authority Conferred on the Executive \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n424.  The Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind projects, \nand Agency Defendants’ adoption and implementation of it, are ultra vires because no act of \nCongress authorizes the President to order that federal agencies “not issue new or renewed \napprovals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore-wind projects” pending \n98 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 99 of 108\n   \n \ncompletion, at an unspecified time, of another assessment of alleged impacts of the industry. \n425.  Specifically, none of the statutory authorities governing federal approvals of wind-\nenergy development—including, but not limited to, OCSLA, the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and \nHarbors Act, the Clean Air Act, NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle \nProtection Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, FLPMA, and the Fixing America’s \nSurface Transportation Act—authorizes the Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ categorical \nand indefinite halt on wind-energy-project approvals pending a redundant extra-statutory review \nin consultation with six agencies. To the contrary, these statutes require the Executive to promptly \nprocess distinct federal approvals for such development, according to specific procedures and \nstandards. \n426.  For example, under OCSLA, in contrast to its express authorization of lease \nwithdrawals, OCSLA does not provide the President or BOEM with authority to categorically and \nindefinitely halt all approvals of wind projects on the Outer Continental Shelf.  \n427.  The Wind Directive and Agency Defendants’ categorical and indefinite halt of \napprovals is incompatible with OCSLA’s directive for the “expeditious and orderly development” \nof the Outer Continental Shelf resources.  \n428.  In addition, by indefinitely preventing lessees from obtaining approvals and permits \nnecessary for wind projects, the Wind Directive and BOEM’s implementation of it effectively \nremove leased areas in the Outer Continental Shelf from use. While OCSLA allows the President \nto withdraw unleased areas from use, it does not grant the President or BOEM authority to \nindefinitely withdraw leased areas from use. 43 U.S.C. § 1341(a). \n99 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 100 of 108\n   \n \n429.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are therefore entitled to a declaration that \nthe Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind projects, and Agency \nDefendants’ implementation of it, are ultra vires.  \n430.  Because the Agency Defendants’ implementation of the Wind Directive is ultra \nvires, the States are entitled to equitable relief in the form of a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction preventing Agency Defendants from implementing the Wind Directive, including taking \nany action(s) to impede wind-energy development in reliance, in whole or in part, on the Wind \nDirective.  \nCOUNT V \nOCSLA Citizen Suit – 43 U.S.C. § 1349 \n(Against Defendants United States, DOI, Burgum, BOEM, and Cruickshank) \n \n431.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs. \n432.  OCSLA provides that “any person having a valid legal interest which is or may be \nadversely affected may commence a civil action on his own behalf to compel compliance with this \nsubchapter  against  any  person,  including  the  United  States,  and  any  other  government \ninstrumentality or agency (to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the Constitution) \nfor any alleged violation of any provision of this subchapter or any regulation promulgated under \nthis subchapter, or of the terms of any permit or lease issued by the Secretary  under this \nsubchapter.” 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a)(1). \n433.  “The term ‘person’ includes, in addition to a natural person, an association, a State, \na political subdivision of a State, or a private, public, or municipal corporation.” 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1331(d). \n100 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 101 of 108\n   \n \n434.  An OCSLA citizen suit may be brought “immediately after notification of the \nalleged violation in any case in which the alleged violation constitutes an imminent threat to the \npublic health or safety or would immediately affect a legal interest of the plaintiff.” 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1349(a)(3). \n435.  Pursuant to 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a)(3), on May 5, 2025, the States provided notice of \nviolations of OCSLA by Defendants the United States, DOI, Burgum, BOEM, and Cruickshank. \n436.  The Wind Directive and Defendants DOI, Burgum, BOEM, and Cruickshank’s (the \nDOI Defendants) adoption of its categorical and indefinite halt on permitting of wind-energy \nprojects is immediately adversely affecting the States’ legal interest in the “expeditious and orderly \ndevelopment,” 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3), of wind energy on the Outer Continental Shelf. \n437.  The  States  have  invested  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  wind-energy \ndevelopment and even more in transmission upgrades needed to bring wind-energy resources onto \nthe electricity grid. This investment has spurred the wind-energy industry to spend billions on \ninfrastructure, jobs training programs, and supply-chain development.  \n438.  The States have relied on wind energy as a reliable, affordable source of electricity \nthat helps meet rising demand. \n439.  The States also rely on wind energy to help meet their goals, often required by state \nlaw,  to  decarbonize  their  electricity  grids  and  mitigate  greenhouse-gas  emissions.  These \ndecarbonization efforts are designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, which are harming \nand will continue to harm the wellbeing and stability of the States’ communities and economies. \n440.  The Wind Directive and the DOI Defendants’ adoption and implementation of its \ncategorical, indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects violate OCSLA and its regulations \nby  ignoring  the  statute’s  clear  mandate  that  the  DOI  Defendants’  follow  its  procedures  to \n101 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 102 of 108\n   \n \nadminister the Outer Continental Shelf permitting and leasing program, as described supra ¶¶ 393–\n94, 426–28. \n441.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a declaration that the Wind \nDirective and the DOI Defendants’ adoption and implementation to categorically and indefinitely \nhalt permitting of wind-energy projects violate OCSLA as inconsistent with the statute and its \nimplementing regulations. \n442.  The States are further entitled to a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \nthe DOI Defendants from implementing the Wind Directive, including taking any action(s) to \nimpede wind-energy development in reliance, in whole or in part, on the Wind Directive. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the States respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  Declare that each Agency Defendant’s adoption and implementation of the Wind \nDirective’s categorical and indefinite halt on approvals of wind-energy projects are arbitrary and \ncapricious in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \n2.  Declare that each Agency Defendant’s adoption and implementation of the Wind \nDirective’s  categorical  and  indefinite  halt  on  approvals  of  wind-energy  projects  are  not  in \naccordance with law or are in excess of statutory right in violation of the APA,  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C), and OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a); \n3.  Declare that the Wind Directive’s categorical and indefinite halt on wind-energy \napprovals, and Agency Defendants’ adoption and implementation thereof, are ultra vires; \n4.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) and 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a), order vacatur of the Agency \nDefendants’ adoption and implementation of the Wind Directive;  \n102 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11221-WGY     Document 141     Filed 06/10/25     Page 103 of 108\n   \n \n5.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin, without bond, the Agency Defendants from \nimplementing or otherwise giving effect to any action that halts or otherwise impedes wind-energy \ndevelopment based in whole or in part on the Wind Directive; and \n6.  Grant all other relief as the Court may deem just and proper, including, but not \nlimited to, attorney’s fees and costs. \n \nRespectfully submitted,            June 10, 2025 \n \nLETITIA JAMES  ANDREA JOY CAMPBELL \nAttorney General of New York  Attorney General of Massachusetts \n    \nBy: /s/ Michael J.
