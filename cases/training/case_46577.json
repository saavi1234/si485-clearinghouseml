ROBERTS, JR., \nin his official capacity as Presiding Officer of \nthe Judicial Conference of the United States, \n1 First Street NE,  \nWashington, D.C. 20543.  \n \nROBERT J. CONRAD, \nin his official capacity as Director of the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, \nAdministrative  Office  of  the  United  States \nCourts \nOne Columbus Circle, NE \nWashington, D.C. 20544 \n \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nBACKGROUND \n \n1.  For several years, the media and enterprising lawmakers have launched \nan onslaught to destroy the impartiality and political neutrality of Article III courts \nand, particularly, the Supreme Court. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh have \nall faced political and physical threats because of the politicization and weaponization \nof  the  law.  This  lawfare  has  been  led  by  Senator  Sheldon  Whitehouse  and \nRepresentative Hank Johnson, relying upon an ideologically favorable legacy media, \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 2 of 14\n \nto falsely accuse Justices Thomas and Alito of ethical improprieties. Their aim was \nsimple: to chill the judicial independence of these Supreme Court Justices. \n2.  The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 first required Supreme Court \nJustices to make financial disclosures, yet it never required disclosures of personal \nhospitality unrelated to official business. But remarkably, the Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts (“Administrative Office”) has recently approved guidance changing \nthe scope of exempt “personal hospitality” activities to be limited to “food, lodging, or \nentertainment.”  The  changes  were  drafted  by  committees  within  the  Judicial \nConference of the United States (“Judicial Conference” or “the Conference”), then \napproved and published by the Administrative Office in the Federal Register and \neventually adopted by the Judicial Conference. \n3.  Not stopping there, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative \nHank Johnson zealously accused Justice Thomas of acting willfully to violate the \nEthics in Government Act and directed the U.S. Department of Justice to criminally \ninvestigate the matter. Similarly, Senator Whitehouse filed an ethics complaint \nagainst Justice Alito, accusing him of violating “several canons of judicial ethics.” \nLetter from Sheldon Whitehouse, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nFederal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights, to the Honorable John \nG. Roberts, Jr., Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Chairman, \nJudicial  Conference  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States,  Director, \nAdministrative Office (Sept. 4, 2023).  \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 3 of 14\n \n4.  Numerous  reviews  by  the  Conference’s  Committee  on  Financial \nDisclosure have all led to the same result. The former chair, Honorable Bobby R. \nBaldock, his successor, Honorable Joseph H. McKinley, Jr., and former Secretary to \nthe Conference, Honorable Thomas F. Hogan, have all issued determinations that the \nalleged errors and omissions by Justice Thomas were not willful. Yet despite the \nrepeated and conclusive findings for over a decade, Senator Whitehouse and others \nhave not given up their onslaught of attacks. \n5.  The Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office are central levers \nfor  Senator  Whitehouse  and  Representative  Johnson’s  lawfare  enterprise.  The \nConference and the Administrative Office have actively accommodated oversight \nrequests  from  these  congressmen  concerning  their  allegations  against  Justices \nThomas  and  Alito.  Under  our  constitutional  tradition,  accommodations  with \nCongress are the province of the executive branch. The Judicial Conference and the \nAdministrative  Office  are  therefore  executive  agencies.  Such  agencies  must  be \noverseen by the President, not the courts. Judicial relief here not only preserves the \nseparation of powers but also keeps the courts out of politics. \nCOMPLAINT \n \n6.  Plaintiff America First Legal Foundation (“AFL”) brings this action \nagainst the Honorable John G. Roberts, Jr. and the Honorable Robert J. Conrad, in \ntheir official capacities as Presiding Officer of the Judicial Conference and Director \nof the Administrative Office, respectively, to compel compliance with the Freedom of \nInformation Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552. \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 4 of 14\n \n7.  The federal judiciary is the system of courts. These courts are made up \nof judges who preside over cases and controversies. The executive branch, on the other \nhand, is responsible for taking care that the laws are faithfully executed and ensuring \nthe proper functioning of the government. Federal courts rely on the executive branch \nfor facility management and security. Federal judges, as officers of the courts, need \nresources to fulfill their constitutional obligations.  \n8.  Courts definitively do not create agencies to exercise functions beyond \nresolving cases or controversies or administratively supporting those functions. But \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts does exactly that. The Administrative \nOffice is controlled by the Judicial Conference, headed by the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court, John Roberts. The Administrative Office is run by an \nofficer appointed by—and subject to removal by—Chief Justice Roberts. 28 U.S.C. \n§ 601. \n9.  Congress  cannot  constitutionally  delegate  to  an  officer  improperly \nappointed pursuant to Article II powers exceeding those that are informative and \ninvestigative in nature. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 137–39 (1976). \n10.  The Judicial Conference’s duties are executive functions and must be \nsupervised by executive officers who are appointed and accountable to other executive \nofficers. United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 6 (2021) (Officers who engage in \nexecutive functions and are not nominated by the President “must be directed and \nsupervised by an officer who has been.”). \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 5 of 14\n \n11.  Thus,  the  Judicial  Conference  and  Administrative  Office  exercise \nexecutive functions and are accordingly subject to FOIA. Accordingly, their refusal to \ncomply with AFL’s FOIA request is unlawful. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  action  pursuant  to  5  U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Additionally, it may grant declaratory relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 et seq. \n13.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff AFL is a nonprofit organization working to promote the rule of \nlaw in the United States, prevent executive overreach, and ensure due process and \nequal protection for all Americans. AFL’s mission includes promoting government \ntransparency and accountability by gathering official information, analyzing it, and \ndisseminating it through reports, press releases, and/or other media. \n15.  Defendant, John G. Roberts, Jr., in his official capacity as Presiding \nOfficer of the Judicial Conference of the United States, is the head of an “agency” \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n16.  The Judicial Conference of the United States is located at 1 First Street \nNE, Washington, D.C. 20543.  \n17.  The  Judicial  Conference  is  a  policymaking  body  that  oversees  the \nAdministrative Office and appoints and removes its directors. \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 6 of 14\n \n18.  Defendant, Robert J. Conrad, in his official capacity as Director of the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, is the head of an “agency” within the \nmeaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n19.  The  Administrative  Office  of  the  U.S.  Courts’  office  is  located  at  1 \nColumbus Circle NE, Washington, D.C. 20002.  \n20.  The Administrative Office has its own self-contained, organizational \nstructure, composed of over 1,000 employees and numerous committees with distinct \nfunctions. \nFACTS \n21.  Recently, the media and liberal lawmakers have sought to undermine \nthe political independence of Article III Courts.  \n22.  Upon information and belief, Senator Whitehouse and Representative \nJohnson  communicated  with  staff  from  the  Judicial  Conference  and  the \nAdministrative Office related to their allegations against Justices Thomas and Alito. \n23.  On  July  30,  2024,  AFL  submitted  FOIA  requests  to  the  Judicial \nConference  and  the  Administrative  Office  seeking  records  of  communications \nbetween  the  agencies  and  Senator  Whitehouse,  Representative  Johnson,  or  any \nmember of their staff. Exhibit 1. \n24.  On September 6, 2024, Ethan Torrey, Legal Counsel to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, replied to AFL on behalf of the Judicial Conference and \nthe Administrative Office. The response stated the agencies’ belief that both the \nConference and the Administrative Office are exempt from the FOIA. Exhibit 2. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 7 of 14\n \n25.  AFL believes that this decision is a legal error and that the Judicial \nConference and the Administrative Office are subject to FOIA. \nThe Judicial Conference Is an Executive Agency Subject to FOIA \n \n26.  The  FOIA  incorporates  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act’s  (“APA”) \ndefinition of “agency,” which means “each authority of the Government of the United \nStates, whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency, but does \nnot  include  .  .  .  the courts  of  the  United  States.”  5  U.S.C.  §§  551(1),  552(f)(1). \nSpecifically included within its definition are “independent establishment[s],” §§ 104, \n105, and “any independent regulatory agency[s].” § 552(f)(1). \n27.  The Judicial Conference is subject to the APA and the FOIA because it \nis: (1) an independent establishment,  and (2)  an independent executive agency. \nUnlike Article III institutions, which are intended to adjudicate, an executive agency \nholds inherent regulatory powers from which it formulates rules relating to its \norganization, procedures, or practice requirements. Accord. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1). \n28.  The Judicial Conference is not a “court of the United States,” nor has it \nbeen ordained one by Congress. See 28 U.S.C. § 451. \n29.  The Conference’s ministerial duty to respond to congressional oversight \nexemplifies its status as an administrative body rather than a court of law. Congress \nhas asserted that it “created the Judicial Conference by statute, funds the Judicial \nConference  through  appropriations,  and  enacted  the  ethics  laws  the  Judicial \nConference administers, and so has an obvious interest in overseeing these matters.” \nLetter from Sheldon Whitehouse, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 8 of 14\n \nFederal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights & Henry C. Johnson, \nJr.,  Ranking  Member,  House  Judiciary  Subcommittee  on  Courts,  Intellectual \nProperty, and the Internet, to Robert Conrad, Director, Administrative Office (June \n17, 2024).  \n30.  The  Judicial  Conference’s  organic  statute  prescribes  the  agency  a \nvariety  of  regulatory  and  administrative  roles.  28  U.S.C.  §  331.  The  Judicial \nConference’s  authority  to  promulgate  and  amend  regulations  makes  it  an \nindependent regulatory agency, subjecting it to the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1). \n31.  The  Judicial  Conference  has  duties  that  are  independent  from  the \njudiciary’s  role  in  resolving  cases  or  controversies,  thus  qualifying  it  as  an \nindependent establishment, and as such, an agency. \n32.  The Judicial Conference has the power to “prescribe and modify rules \nfor the exercise of the authority provided in [28 U.S.C. §§ 351 et seq.],” which are \nrequired to be carried in effect by “[a]ll judicial officers and employees of the United \nStates.” § 331. \n33.  The Judicial Conference is required to provide the public with notice and \nan opportunity to comment when proposing rules to be prescribed. 28 U.S.C. §§ 358(c), \n2073. Moreover, proposed rules are required to be published in the Federal Register—\nthe  official  journal  that  documents  rules  made  by  agencies.  Procedures  for  the \nJudicial Conference’s Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and Its Advisory \nRules Committees, as codified in Guide to Judiciary Policy, Vol. 1, § 440.20.40. \n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 9 of 14\n \n34.  Notably, the Federal Register Act and the APA—acts requiring agencies \nto provide public notice and an opportunity to participate in policymaking—establish \nand outline the rulemaking process by which Executive Branch agencies issue legally \nbinding rules. See 44 U.S.C. § 1501. Neither Congress nor courts publish their \nconstitutional pronouncements in the Federal Register. \n35.  Further,  the  Judicial  Conference’s  organic  statute  authorizes  the \nConference to create standing committees, whose members are appointed by the \nChief Justice, and are authorized to “hold hearings, take sworn testimony, issue \nsubpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, and make necessary and appropriate orders \nin the exercise of its authority.” Compare 28 U.S.C. § 331 (2021), with Act of June 25, \n1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 869, 907 (The original enactment of Title 28 of the United \nStates Code did not provide the Judicial Conference with enumerated subpoena \nauthorities. It was not until later statutory amendments that Congress expanded the \nagency’s executive powers to include issuing and enforcing subpoenas.). \n36.  The  committees’  powers  preclude  the  members  from  being  mere \nemployees; they must be officers. Accordingly, if the Chief Justice does indeed have \nthis power to appoint officers, then he must be acting as an agency head, subjecting \nthe Judicial Conference to the FOIA. \n37.  The  Presiding  Officer  of  the  Conference  is  required  to  submit  to \nCongress reports of proceedings and recommendations for legislation. 28 U.S.C. § 331. \nCongress  has  the  authority  to  direct  agencies  and  administrative  officers  or \nemployees  to  report  to  the  legislature,  but  judges  are  independent  of  any \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 10 of 14\n \nCongressional control save for impeachment. Directing the Chief Justice to take such \naction indicates the Judicial Conference acts as a federal agency. \n38.  The Presiding Officer of the Judicial Conference is a principal officer and \nis  required  to  be  presidentially  appointed.  The  power  to  further  appoint  other \nexecutive officers of its subsidiary agency, the Administrative Office, reaffirms this \nfact. 28 U.S.C. § 601. \n39.  The  Administrative  Office’s  Director,  to  the  extent  he  engages  in \nexecutive powers with no superior other than the President, is a principal officer. \nThe Administrative Office Is an Executive Agency Subject to FOIA \n40.  As a subsidiary of the Judicial Conference, the Administrative Office is \nan independent establishment, making it an “agency.” Its substantial performance of \nexecutive functions subjects it to the FOIA’s requirements. \n41.  The Administrative Office is not a court. It has no judicial power, and \nits officers and employees are not acting as judges when acting pursuant to their \nAdministrative Office roles. See 28 U.S.C. § 607 (expressly prohibiting all officers and \nemployees of the Administrative Office from engaging directly or indirectly in the \npractice of law in any court of the United States). Further, unlike courts of the United \nStates that require judges to be removed by impeachment, the Director is appointed \nand removed by the Chief Justice. Id. § 601. \n42.  The  Administrative  Office  has  been  responsive  to  congressional \noversight.  Letter  from  Sheldon  Whitehouse,  Chairman,  Senate  Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights & \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 11 of 14\n \nHenry C. Johnson, Jr., Ranking Member, House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, \nIntellectual Property, and the Internet, to Robert Conrad, Director, Administrative \nOffice  (June  17,  2024);  U.S.  Congress,  Senate  Committee  on \nAppropriations, Financial  Services  and  General  Government  Appropriations  Bill, \n2024, report to accompany S. 2309, 118th Cong., 1st sess., July 13, 2023, S. Rep. 118-\n61, at 46. It is hornbook administrative law that only executive branch entities, not \nthe courts, are subject to legislative oversight. Russell Wheeler, Justice Thomas, Gift \nReporting Rules, and What a Supreme Court Code of Conduct Would and Wouldn’t \nAccomplish, Brookings (May 1, 2023), https://perma.cc/C7HQ-JHA5. To hold that the \nAdministrative Office is a court is tantamount to concluding that Congress has the \npower to superintend judges through its oversight power. \n43.  28 U.S.C. § 601 plainly states that the Director of the Administrative \nOffice is an officer of an executive agency. (“The Director and Deputy Director shall \nbe deemed to be officers for purposes of title 5, United States Code.”); see 5 U.S.C. \n§ 2104 (defining “officer” as an individual who is: (1) required by law to be appointed \nby the President, a court, the head of an executive agency, or the Secretary of a \nmilitary department; (2) “engaged in the performance of a Federal function under \nauthority of law or an Executive act;” and (3) “subject to the supervision” of one of the \npreviously listed authorities “or the Judicial Conference of the United States, while \nengaged in the performance of the duties of his office.”). Thus, unlike judges who do \nnot require executive supervision, the Director is required to be supervised while \nperforming executive functions as the head of an executive agency. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 12 of 14\n \n44.  The  Administrative  Office  is  an  independent  agency  within  the \nexecutive because it engages in executive functions. \n45.  The  Director  of  the  Administrative  Office  exercises  core  executive \nfunctions with vast discretion and autonomy. \n46.  The  Director  issues  regulations  implementing  the  Fair  Chance  to \nCompete for Jobs Act of 2019. 28 U.S.C. § 604(i)(5)(A) (“The regulations issued . . . \nshall be the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the Director of the Office \nof Personnel Management.”). That Act requires the Office of Personnel Management, \nthe General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense—all executive \nagencies—to issue the same regulations. \n47.  The Director has complete discretion in fixing the compensation of, and \nappointing, inferior officers. 28 U.S.C. §§ 602, 604(a)(5), (16)(A). \n48.  Further,  “[a]ll  functions  of  other  officers  and  employees  of  the \nAdministrative Office and all functions of organizational units of the Administrative \nOffice are vested in the Director,” and even more, “[t]he Director may delegate any of \nthe Director’s functions, powers, duties, and authority . . . to such officers and \nemployees” as he may choose. Id. § 602(d). \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nViolation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 \n49.  AFL repeats and reincorporates the preceding paragraphs. \n50.  AFL properly requested records within the possession, custody, and \ncontrol of the Defendants. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 13 of 14\n \n51.  The  Defendants  have  failed  to  produce  the  requested  records,  and \nstatements have been made on their behalf that they will not do so. \n52.  Accordingly,  AFL  has  exhausted  its  administrative  remedies.  See \n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(c)(i).  \n53.  The Defendant has violated the FOIA by failing, within the prescribed \ntime limit, to (i) reasonably search for records responsive to AFL’s FOIA requests; (ii) \nprovide a lawful reason for the withholding of any responsive records; and (iii) \nsegregate exempt information in otherwise non-exempt responsive records. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  AFL respectfully requests this Court: \n  i.  Declare that the records sought by these requests, as described in the \nforegoing, must be disclosed under 5 U.S.C. § 552; \n  ii.  Declare that the Defendants are subject to the FOIA as independent \nagencies within the executive branch;  \niii.  Order the Defendants to conduct searches immediately for all records \nresponsive to AFL’s FOIA requests and demonstrate that they employed search \nmethods reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of responsive records; \n  iv.

ROBERTS, JR., \nin his official capacity as Presiding Officer of \nthe Judicial Conference of the United States, \n1 First Street NE,  \nWashington, D.C. 20543.  \n \nROBERT J.

For several years, the media and enterprising lawmakers have launched \nan onslaught to destroy the impartiality and political neutrality of Article III courts \nand, particularly, the Supreme Court. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh have \nall faced political and physical threats because of the politicization and weaponization \nof  the  law.  This  lawfare  has  been  led  by  Senator  Sheldon  Whitehouse  and \nRepresentative Hank Johnson, relying upon an ideologically favorable legacy media, \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 2 of 14\n \nto falsely accuse Justices Thomas and Alito of ethical improprieties. Their aim was \nsimple: to chill the judicial independence of these Supreme Court Justices. \n2.  The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 first required Supreme Court \nJustices to make financial disclosures, yet it never required disclosures of personal \nhospitality unrelated to official business. But remarkably, the Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts (“Administrative Office”) has recently approved guidance changing \nthe scope of exempt “personal hospitality” activities to be limited to “food, lodging, or \nentertainment.”  The  changes  were  drafted  by  committees  within  the  Judicial \nConference of the United States (“Judicial Conference” or “the Conference”), then \napproved and published by the Administrative Office in the Federal Register and \neventually adopted by the Judicial Conference. \n3.  Not stopping there, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative \nHank Johnson zealously accused Justice Thomas of acting willfully to violate the \nEthics in Government Act and directed the U.S. Department of Justice to criminally \ninvestigate the matter. Similarly, Senator Whitehouse filed an ethics complaint \nagainst Justice Alito, accusing him of violating “several canons of judicial ethics.” \nLetter from Sheldon Whitehouse, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nFederal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights, to the Honorable John \nG. Roberts, Jr., Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Chairman, \nJudicial  Conference  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States,  Director, \nAdministrative Office (Sept. 4, 2023).  \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 3 of 14\n \n4.  Numerous  reviews  by  the  Conference’s  Committee  on  Financial \nDisclosure have all led to the same result. The former chair, Honorable Bobby R. \nBaldock, his successor, Honorable Joseph H. McKinley, Jr., and former Secretary to \nthe Conference, Honorable Thomas F. Hogan, have all issued determinations that the \nalleged errors and omissions by Justice Thomas were not willful. Yet despite the \nrepeated and conclusive findings for over a decade, Senator Whitehouse and others \nhave not given up their onslaught of attacks. \n5.  The Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office are central levers \nfor  Senator  Whitehouse  and  Representative  Johnson’s  lawfare  enterprise.  The \nConference and the Administrative Office have actively accommodated oversight \nrequests  from  these  congressmen  concerning  their  allegations  against  Justices \nThomas  and  Alito.  Under  our  constitutional  tradition,  accommodations  with \nCongress are the province of the executive branch. The Judicial Conference and the \nAdministrative  Office  are  therefore  executive  agencies.  Such  agencies  must  be \noverseen by the President, not the courts. Judicial relief here not only preserves the \nseparation of powers but also keeps the courts out of politics. \n6.  Plaintiff America First Legal Foundation (“AFL”) brings this action \nagainst the Honorable John G. Roberts, Jr. and the Honorable Robert J. Conrad, in \ntheir official capacities as Presiding Officer of the Judicial Conference and Director \nof the Administrative Office, respectively, to compel compliance with the Freedom of \nInformation Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552. \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 4 of 14\n \n7.  The federal judiciary is the system of courts. These courts are made up \nof judges who preside over cases and controversies. The executive branch, on the other \nhand, is responsible for taking care that the laws are faithfully executed and ensuring \nthe proper functioning of the government. Federal courts rely on the executive branch \nfor facility management and security. Federal judges, as officers of the courts, need \nresources to fulfill their constitutional obligations.  \n8.  Courts definitively do not create agencies to exercise functions beyond \nresolving cases or controversies or administratively supporting those functions. But \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts does exactly that. The Administrative \nOffice is controlled by the Judicial Conference, headed by the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court, John Roberts. The Administrative Office is run by an \nofficer appointed by—and subject to removal by—Chief Justice Roberts. 28 U.S.C. \n§ 601. \n9.  Congress  cannot  constitutionally  delegate  to  an  officer  improperly \nappointed pursuant to Article II powers exceeding those that are informative and \ninvestigative in nature. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 137–39 (1976). \n10.  The Judicial Conference’s duties are executive functions and must be \nsupervised by executive officers who are appointed and accountable to other executive \nofficers. United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 6 (2021) (Officers who engage in \nexecutive functions and are not nominated by the President “must be directed and \nsupervised by an officer who has been.”). \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 5 of 14\n \n11.  Thus,  the  Judicial  Conference  and  Administrative  Office  exercise \nexecutive functions and are accordingly subject to FOIA. Accordingly, their refusal to \ncomply with AFL’s FOIA request is unlawful. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  action  pursuant  to  5  U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Additionally, it may grant declaratory relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 et seq. \n13.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff AFL is a nonprofit organization working to promote the rule of \nlaw in the United States, prevent executive overreach, and ensure due process and \nequal protection for all Americans. AFL’s mission includes promoting government \ntransparency and accountability by gathering official information, analyzing it, and \ndisseminating it through reports, press releases, and/or other media. \n15.  Defendant, John G. Roberts, Jr., in his official capacity as Presiding \nOfficer of the Judicial Conference of the United States, is the head of an “agency” \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n16.  The Judicial Conference of the United States is located at 1 First Street \nNE, Washington, D.C. 20543.  \n17.  The  Judicial  Conference  is  a  policymaking  body  that  oversees  the \nAdministrative Office and appoints and removes its directors. \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 6 of 14\n \n18.  Defendant, Robert J. Conrad, in his official capacity as Director of the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, is the head of an “agency” within the \nmeaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n19.  The  Administrative  Office  of  the  U.S.  Courts’  office  is  located  at  1 \nColumbus Circle NE, Washington, D.C. 20002.  \n20.  The Administrative Office has its own self-contained, organizational \nstructure, composed of over 1,000 employees and numerous committees with distinct \nfunctions. \nFACTS \n21.  Recently, the media and liberal lawmakers have sought to undermine \nthe political independence of Article III Courts.  \n22.  Upon information and belief, Senator Whitehouse and Representative \nJohnson  communicated  with  staff  from  the  Judicial  Conference  and  the \nAdministrative Office related to their allegations against Justices Thomas and Alito. \n23.  On  July  30,  2024,  AFL  submitted  FOIA  requests  to  the  Judicial \nConference  and  the  Administrative  Office  seeking  records  of  communications \nbetween  the  agencies  and  Senator  Whitehouse,  Representative  Johnson,  or  any \nmember of their staff. Exhibits 1, 2. \n24.  On September 6, 2024, Ethan Torrey, Legal Counsel to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, responded to AFL’s request to the Judicial Conference. \nThe response stated the agency’s belief that both the Judicial Conference and the \nAdministrative Office are exempt from the FOIA. Exhibit 3. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 7 of 14\n \n25.  On November 8, 2024, Andrew Grant, Financial Disclosure Committee \nCounsel to the Administrative Office, replied to AFL’s request to the Administrative \nOffice. The response stated the agency’s belief that the Administrative Office is \nexempt from the FOIA. Exhibit 4. \n26.  AFL believes that these decisions are legal errors and that the Judicial \nConference and the Administrative Office are subject to FOIA. \nThe Judicial Conference Is an Executive Agency Subject to FOIA \n \n27.  The  FOIA  incorporates  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act’s  (“APA”) \ndefinition of “agency,” which means “each authority of the Government of the United \nStates, whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency, but does \nnot  include  .  .  .  the courts  of  the  United  States.”  5  U.S.C.  §§  551(1),  552(f)(1). \nSpecifically included within its definition are “independent establishment[s],” §§ 104, \n105, and “any independent regulatory agency[s].” § 552(f)(1). \n28.  The Judicial Conference is subject to the APA and the FOIA because it \nis: (1) an independent establishment,  and (2)  an independent executive agency. \nUnlike Article III institutions, which are intended to adjudicate, an executive agency \nholds inherent regulatory powers from which it formulates rules relating to its \norganization, procedures, or practice requirements. Accord. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1). \n29.  The Judicial Conference is not a “court of the United States,” nor has it \nbeen ordained one by Congress. See 28 U.S.C. § 451. \n30.  The Conference’s ministerial duty to respond to congressional oversight \nexemplifies its status as an administrative body rather than a court of law. Congress \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 8 of 14\n \nhas asserted that it “created the Judicial Conference by statute, funds the Judicial \nConference  through  appropriations,  and  enacted  the  ethics  laws  the  Judicial \nConference administers, and so has an obvious interest in overseeing these matters.” \nLetter from Sheldon Whitehouse, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nFederal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights & Henry C. Johnson, \nJr.,  Ranking  Member,  House  Judiciary  Subcommittee  on  Courts,  Intellectual \nProperty, and the Internet, to Robert Conrad, Director, Administrative Office (June \n17, 2024).  \n31.  The  Judicial  Conference’s  organic  statute  prescribes  the  agency  a \nvariety  of  regulatory  and  administrative  roles.  28  U.S.C.  §  331.  The  Judicial \nConference’s  authority  to  promulgate  and  amend  regulations  makes  it  an \nindependent regulatory agency, subjecting it to the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1). \n32.  The  Judicial  Conference  has  duties  that  are  independent  from  the \njudiciary’s  role  in  resolving  cases  or  controversies,  thus  qualifying  it  as  an \nindependent establishment, and as such, an agency. \n33.  The Judicial Conference has the power to “prescribe and modify rules \nfor the exercise of the authority provided in [28 U.S.C. §§ 351 et seq.],” which are \nrequired to be carried in effect by “[a]ll judicial officers and employees of the United \nStates.” § 331. \n34.  The Judicial Conference is required to provide the public with notice and \nan opportunity to comment when proposing rules to be prescribed. 28 U.S.C. §§ 358(c), \n2073. Moreover, proposed rules are required to be published in the Federal Register—\n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 9 of 14\n \nthe  official  journal  that  documents  rules  made  by  agencies.  Procedures  for  the \nJudicial Conference’s Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and Its Advisory \nRules Committees, as codified in Guide to Judiciary Policy, Vol. 1, § 440.20.40. \n35.  Notably, the Federal Register Act and the APA—acts requiring agencies \nto provide public notice and an opportunity to participate in policymaking—establish \nand outline the rulemaking process by which Executive Branch agencies issue legally \nbinding rules. See 44 U.S.C. § 1501. Neither Congress nor courts publish their \nconstitutional pronouncements in the Federal Register. \n36.  Further,  the  Judicial  Conference’s  organic  statute  authorizes  the \nConference to create standing committees, whose members are appointed by the \nChief Justice, and are authorized to “hold hearings, take sworn testimony, issue \nsubpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, and make necessary and appropriate orders \nin the exercise of its authority.” Compare 28 U.S.C. § 331 (2021), with Act of June 25, \n1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 869, 907 (The original enactment of Title 28 of the United \nStates Code did not provide the Judicial Conference with enumerated subpoena \nauthorities. It was not until later statutory amendments that Congress expanded the \nagency’s executive powers to include issuing and enforcing subpoenas.). \n37.  The  committees’  powers  preclude  the  members  from  being  mere \nemployees; they must be officers. Accordingly, if the Chief Justice does indeed have \nthis power to appoint officers, then he must be acting as an agency head, subjecting \nthe Judicial Conference to the FOIA. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 10 of 14\n \n38.  The  Presiding  Officer  of  the  Conference  is  required  to  submit  to \nCongress reports of proceedings and recommendations for legislation. 28 U.S.C. § 331. \nCongress  has  the  authority  to  direct  agencies  and  administrative  officers  or \nemployees  to  report  to  the  legislature,  but  judges  are  independent  of  any \nCongressional control save for impeachment. Directing the Chief Justice to take such \naction indicates the Judicial Conference acts as a federal agency. \n39.  The Presiding Officer of the Judicial Conference is a principal officer and \nis  required  to  be  presidentially  appointed.  The  power  to  further  appoint  other \nexecutive officers of its subsidiary agency, the Administrative Office, reaffirms this \nfact. 28 U.S.C. § 601. \n40.  The  Administrative  Office’s  Director,  to  the  extent  he  engages  in \nexecutive powers with no superior other than the President, is a principal officer. \nThe Administrative Office Is an Executive Agency Subject to FOIA \n41.  As a subsidiary of the Judicial Conference, the Administrative Office is \nan independent establishment, making it an “agency.” Its substantial performance of \nexecutive functions subjects it to the FOIA’s requirements. \n42.  The Administrative Office is not a court. It has no judicial power, and \nits officers and employees are not acting as judges when acting pursuant to their \nAdministrative Office roles. See 28 U.S.C. § 607 (expressly prohibiting all officers and \nemployees of the Administrative Office from engaging directly or indirectly in the \npractice of law in any court of the United States). Further, unlike courts of the United \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 11 of 14\n \nStates that require judges to be removed by impeachment, the Director is appointed \nand removed by the Chief Justice. Id. § 601. \n43.  The  Administrative  Office  has  been  responsive  to  congressional \noversight.  Letter  from  Sheldon  Whitehouse,  Chairman,  Senate  Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights & \nHenry C. Johnson, Jr., Ranking Member, House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, \nIntellectual Property, and the Internet, to Robert Conrad, Director, Administrative \nOffice  (June  17,  2024);  U.S.  Congress,  Senate  Committee  on \nAppropriations, Financial  Services  and  General  Government  Appropriations  Bill, \n2024, report to accompany S. 2309, 118th Cong., 1st sess., July 13, 2023, S. Rep. 118-\n61, at 46. It is hornbook administrative law that only executive branch entities, not \nthe courts, are subject to legislative oversight. Russell Wheeler, Justice Thomas, Gift \nReporting Rules, and What a Supreme Court Code of Conduct Would and Wouldn’t \nAccomplish, Brookings (May 1, 2023), https://perma.cc/C7HQ-JHA5. To hold that the \nAdministrative Office is a court is tantamount to concluding that Congress has the \npower to superintend judges through its oversight power. \n44.  28 U.S.C. § 601 plainly states that the Director of the Administrative \nOffice is an officer of an executive agency. (“The Director and Deputy Director shall \nbe deemed to be officers for purposes of title 5, United States Code.”); see 5 U.S.C. \n§ 2104 (defining “officer” as an individual who is: (1) required by law to be appointed \nby the President, a court, the head of an executive agency, or the Secretary of a \nmilitary department; (2) “engaged in the performance of a Federal function under \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 12 of 14\n \nauthority of law or an Executive act;” and (3) “subject to the supervision” of one of the \npreviously listed authorities “or the Judicial Conference of the United States, while \nengaged in the performance of the duties of his office.”). Thus, unlike judges who do \nnot require executive supervision, the Director is required to be supervised while \nperforming executive functions as the head of an executive agency. \n45.  The  Administrative  Office  is  an  independent  agency  within  the \nexecutive because it engages in executive functions. \n46.  The  Director  of  the  Administrative  Office  exercises  core  executive \nfunctions with vast discretion and autonomy. \n47.  The  Director  issues  regulations  implementing  the  Fair  Chance  to \nCompete for Jobs Act of 2019. 28 U.S.C. § 604(i)(5)(A) (“The regulations issued . . . \nshall be the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the Director of the Office \nof Personnel Management.”). That Act requires the Office of Personnel Management, \nthe General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense—all executive \nagencies—to issue the same regulations. \n48.  The Director has complete discretion in fixing the compensation of, and \nappointing, inferior officers. 28 U.S.C. §§ 602, 604(a)(5), (16)(A). \n49.  Further,  “[a]ll  functions  of  other  officers  and  employees  of  the \nAdministrative Office and all functions of organizational units of the Administrative \nOffice are vested in the Director,” and even more, “[t]he Director may delegate any of \nthe Director’s functions, powers, duties, and authority . . . to such officers and \nemployees” as he may choose. Id. § 602(d). \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 13 of 14\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nViolation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 \n50.  AFL repeats and reincorporates the preceding paragraphs. \n51.  AFL properly requested records within the possession, custody, and \ncontrol of the Defendants. \n52.  The  Defendants  have  failed  to  produce  the  requested  records,  and \nstatements have been made on their behalf that they will not do so. \n53.  Accordingly,  AFL  has  exhausted  its  administrative  remedies.  See \n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(c)(i).  \n54.  The Defendant has violated the FOIA by failing, within the prescribed \ntime limit, to (i) reasonably search for records responsive to AFL’s FOIA requests; (ii) \nprovide a lawful reason for the withholding of any responsive records; and (iii) \nsegregate exempt information in otherwise non-exempt responsive records. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  AFL respectfully requests this Court: \n  i.  Declare that the records sought by these requests, as described in the \nforegoing, must be disclosed under 5 U.S.C. § 552; \n  ii.  Declare that the Defendants are subject to the FOIA as independent \nagencies within the executive branch;  \niii.  Order the Defendants to conduct searches immediately for all records \nresponsive to AFL’s FOIA requests and demonstrate that they employed search \nmethods reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of responsive records; \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01232     Document 2     Filed 04/22/25     Page 14 of 14\n \n  iv.

Award AFL attorney’s fees and costs under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E); and \n  vi.
