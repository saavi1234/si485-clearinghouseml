    "summary_short": "This case is about a group of states trying to stop the Trump administration from blocking federal money meant for building electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. On May 7, 2025, seventeen states and Washington, D.C. sued the Department of Transportation. They wanted to stop a new order from President Trump called “Terminating the Green New Deal.” This order told the government to stop giving out grant money from a program that helps states build EV charging stations.\r\n\r\nThe states said that this action was not allowed by law and that it went against rules about what powers the government has. They quickly asked the court to stop the government from putting the order in place. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club also joined the case.\r\n\r\nThe judge decided that 14 of the states had strong enough reasons to get early help from the court. The judge said the government could not stop those states from using their approved plans or take away money already given for EV charging stations. However, the judge did not grant this help to Washington, D.C., Minnesota, or Vermont because they did not prove enough harm.\r\n\r\nLater, four more states—Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina—joined the lawsuit. Both sides asked the judge to end the case in their favor without a trial, but the judge has not made a final decision yet. As of October 15, 2025, the case is ongoing",

President Trump has unleashed an attack on an increasingly popular consumer \n3  choice—the electric vehicle. On Inauguration Day, the President issued an executive order \n4  entitled Unleashing American Energy (“Executive Order”), which proclaims it the policy of \n5  the United States to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, \n6  90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025). The federal government, however, has never adopted any \n7  such “EV mandate.” But in the name of eliminating this fictional mandate, the Executive Order \n8  directs the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA” or “Agency”) to usurp the legislative \n9  and spending powers reserved to Congress by withholding congressionally appropriated \n10  funding for electric vehicle (“EV”) charging infrastructure required by statute to be distributed \n11  to States. \n12  2.  Specifically, in a section of the Executive Order entitled “Terminating the \n13  Green New Deal,” the President mandated all federal agencies to “immediately pause the \n14  disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law \n15  117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not \n16  limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National \n17  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. \n18  at 8357. This, the Executive Branch cannot do. \n19  3.  Congress established the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (“NEVI”) \n20  Formula Program, through enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), \n21  also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The IIJA appropriated $5 billion for the \n22  explicit purpose of “providing funding to the States to strategically deploy electric vehicle \n23  charging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected network to facilitate data collection, \n24  access, and reliability.” Pub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, 1421 (2021). Importantly, Congress  \n25  / / / \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 3 of 61\n \n1  required the distribution of this $5 billion among the States1 over fiscal years 2022 through \n2  2026 according to a mandatory formula. Id. at 1422. \n3  4.  The FHWA, although tasked with faithfully administering the NEVI Formula \n4  Program, almost immediately carried out President Trump’s anti-NEVI directive in diametric \n5  opposition to statutory mandate.  \n6  5.  On February 6, 2025, the FHWA notified States via letter (“FHWA Letter”) that \n7  it had taken three actions to categorically and indefinitely “suspend” the NEVI Formula \n8  Program. First, the Agency announced it had rescinded all versions of statutorily required \n9  NEVI Formula Program Guidance. Second—with no advance notice and without reasoned \n10  explanation—the Agency unlawfully revoked all prior approvals of NEVI Formula Program \n11  implementation plans (“State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans” or “State \n12  Plans”), which States are required to submit to access their share of NEVI Formula Program \n13  funds. In fact, the FHWA retroactively and categorically revoked its prior approval of every \n14  State Plan—more than 150 in total—on the sole basis of its recission of the NEVI Formula \n15  Program Guidance.  \n16  6.  Finally, the FHWA informed the States that “no new obligations may occur \n17  under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is \n18  issued and new State [P]lans are submitted and approved.” The FHWA cited no other reasons \n19  for prohibiting new obligations other than its own retroactive revocation of all State Plan \n20  approvals, an action that itself was predicated only on the Agency’s recission of the NEVI \n21  Formula Program Guidance.  \n22  7.  The FHWA’s actions had the effect of withholding or withdrawing from States \n23  NEVI Formula Program funds available to the States for obligation, functionally abrogating \n24  the congressionally mandated NEVI Formula Program by executive fiat.  \n25 \n \n1 For the purposes of this Complaint, the term “States” includes Puerto Rico and the District of \n26 \nColumbia. \n \nCOMPLAINT  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 4 of 61\n \n1  8.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants’ \n2  unlawful actions. \n3  9.  Plaintiff States each have invested in programs to encourage adoption of EVs as \n4  a means of reducing smog, air toxics, and other harmful pollution from combustion engine \n5  vehicle emissions, which cause grave health problems such as cancer and asthma, and \n6  contributes to the devastating effects of climate change in these States. \n7  10.  The Defendants’ actions impede Plaintiff States’ ability to build the EV \n8  charging infrastructure envisioned under the IIJA and necessary for widespread EV adoption. \n9  This infrastructure is critical to the success of Plaintiff States’ environmental, public health, \n10  and transportation programs—projects Congress actively chose to support in enacting the IIJA \n11  and establishing the NEVI Formula Program. The harms to Plaintiff States will continue and \n12  become increasingly damaging if unabated. \n13  11.  To prevent irreparable injury to Plaintiff States, this Court should declare that \n14  the Defendants’ actions to implement the President’s directive are unlawful under the \n15  Administrative Procedure Act, violate the United States Constitution, and are contrary to the \n16  law, outside the Defendants’ authority, and unlawful under the common law ultra vires \n17  doctrine. Plaintiff States therefore request that this Court vacate the Defendants’ unlawful \n18  actions and preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from, among other things, \n19  implementing or effectuating the directive in the Executive Order to withhold NEVI Formula \n20  Program funds in contravention of the express congressional mandates in the IIJA.  \n21  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22  12.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n23  1346(a)(2). The Court has further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, \n24  28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202. Jurisdiction is also proper under the judicial review provisions \n25  of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 5 of 61\n \n1  13.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and \n2  1391(e)(1).

Congress  Established  the  National  Electric  Vehicle  Infrastructure  Formula \nProgram to Fund Strategic Deployment of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure \n23 \n36.  On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan \n24 \nInfrastructure Law, enacted as the IIJA. 135 Stat. 429. \n25 \n/ / / \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT  6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 8 of 61\n \n1  37.  The IIJA establishes the NEVI Formula Program. Through the IIJA, Congress \n2  appropriated $5 billion and mandated that those funds “shall be to carry out the [NEVI] \n3  Formula Program” and must “remain available until expended.” Id. at 1421. \n4  38.  NEVI Formula Program funds are “formula” funds. See, e.g., City of Los \n5  Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir. 2019). Unlike discretionary funding, formula \n6  funds are appropriated by Congress for a specific purpose and must be distributed on the basis \n7  of a statutory formula. The NEVI Formula Program applies the same federal formula as that \n8  which is used to distribute highway funds. 135 Stat. at 1422.  \n9  39.  The purpose of the NEVI Formula Program is to “provide funding to States to \n10  strategically deploy electric vehicle charging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected \n11  network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability.” Id. at 1421. \n12  40.  More specifically, after setting aside funds for NEVI Formula Program \n13  administration and an additional grant program, NEVI Formula Program funds apportioned to \n14  States “shall be used for: (1) the acquisition and installation of electric vehicle charging \n15  infrastructure to serve as a catalyst for the deployment of such infrastructure and to connect it \n16  to a network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability; (2) proper operation and \n17  maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and (3) data sharing about electric \n18  vehicle charging infrastructure to ensure the long-term success of investments made under [the \n19  NEVI Formula Program provisions of the IIJA].” Id. at. 1421-22; see also id. at 1425 \n20  (discussing set-asides). \n21  41.  The NEVI Formula Program first prioritizes building out “alternative fuel \n22  corridor[s]” with EV charging infrastructure along the national highway system to support \n23  long-distance travel and increase driver confidence in charging port availability during intra- \n24  and interstate travel. Id. at 1423-24. Focusing first on this national network of alternative fuel \n25  corridors (“AFCs”) helps ensure that drivers beyond urban commuter areas have the option to \n26  choose an EV. \n \nCOMPLAINT  7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 9 of 61\n \n1  42.  Distribution of NEVI Formula Program funds is not discretionary: The \n2  Secretary of Transportation (“Secretary”) “shall distribute among the States the [NEVI \n3  Formula Program funds] so that each State receives” the amount determined by the formula. \n4  Id. at 1422 (emphasis added). Indeed, as explained below, even in the limited circumstances a \n5  State may become ineligible to receive its share of NEVI Formula Program funds for a \n6  particular fiscal year, the IIJA requires the Secretary to distribute all lawfully withheld or \n7  withdrawn funds to local jurisdictions within that State, or to other States, for the \n8  congressionally mandated purpose of building out EV charging infrastructure. See id. at 1422-\n9  23. \n10  43.  Congress established a single prerequisite for a State to receive its share of the \n11  NEVI Formula Program funding appropriated by Congress: Each State must submit a State \n12  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan, by a deadline established by the Secretary, \n13  describing how it “intends to use funds distributed to the State . . . to carry out the [NEVI \n14  Formula] Program for each fiscal year in which funds are made available.” Id. at. 1422. \n15  44.  The IIJA further requires the Secretary, within 90 days of the statute’s \n16  enactment, and in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, to develop “guidance for States \n17  and localities to strategically deploy electric vehicle charging infrastructure” consistent with \n18  the NEVI Formula Program provisions of the IIJA (“NEVI Formula Program Guidance”). Id. \n19  at 1423. \n20  45.  The FHWA issued NEVI Formula Program Guidance on February 10, 2022, \n21  and has updated the guidance annually. The FHWA issued the most recent update on June 11, \n22  2024. \n23 \nB.  Process to Distribute Nondiscretionary NEVI Formula Program Funds to States \n24  46.  NEVI Formula Program funds are distributed in accordance with a well-defined \n25  process. The first step in this process was the congressional appropriation, which authorized \n26  the FHWA to incur financial obligations that will result in immediate or future disbursements \n \nCOMPLAINT  8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 10 of 61\n \n1  of funds from the U.S. Treasury. See 2 U.S.C. § 622(2)(A)(i). In the IIJA, Congress \n2  appropriated $5 billion, “to remain available until expended,” to carry out the NEVI Formula \n3  Program in accordance with specific directives and subject to express constraints. 135 Stat. at \n4  1421. \n5  47.  Next, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), which administers \n6  the federal budget, apportioned the funds appropriated by Congress by dividing the $5 billion \n7  appropriation across five fiscal years and distributed the funds to the FHWA. See U.S. Gov’t \n8  Accountability Off., GAO-05-734SP, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget \n9  Process, at 12-13 (Sept. 2005) (“Budget Glossary”).2 The FHWA, which is within the U.S. \n10  Department of Transportation (“U.S. DOT”), annually certifies a further apportionment. This \n11  further apportionment includes setting aside the funds for NEVI Formula Program \n12  administration of the and an additional grant program. The FHWA then divides the remaining \n13  funds for that fiscal year among the States according to the non-discretionary statutory \n14  formula.  \n15  48.  The IIJA’s formula explicitly requires the Secretary to apportion NEVI Formula \n16  Program funds among the States, such that each receives a share of funding proportional to the \n17  combined amount that the FHWA distributes in Federal-aid highway apportionments.3, 4 135 \n18  Stat. at 1422 (citing 23 U.S.C. § 104(c) and § 165). Those amounts are fixed in statute based \n19  on historical apportionments and congressionally determined shares, 23 U.S.C. §§ 104(c), 165. \n20  Neither the Secretary nor the FHWA, nor any other part of the Executive Branch has discretion \n21  to determine the amount of funding apportioned to any State under the NEVI Formula \n22  Program.  \n23 \n \n24  2 Available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf. \n3 Puerto Rico’s share is equal to the amount the FHWA distributes in Puerto Rico Highway Program \nfunding. \n25 \n4 See, e.g., FHWA, Notice: Apportionment of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Highway Infrastructure Program \nFunds for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment \n26 \nand Jobs Act (Feb. 10, 2022), a true and accurate copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n \nCOMPLAINT  9  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 11 of 61\n \n1  49.  After reviewing each State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n2  submitted, the FHWA notifies each State by letter that its funds for the fiscal year(s) covered \n3  by the Plan are “available for obligation.”5  \n4  50.  An obligation is a “definite commitment that creates a legal liability of the \n5  government for the payment of goods and services ordered or received, or a legal duty on the \n6  part of the United States that could mature into” such a liability; an “expenditure,” also known \n7  as a “disbursement,” is the actual spending of federal funds. Budget Glossary at 45, 48, 70.  \n8  51.  States obligate their share of apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds by \n9  submitting to the FHWA an authorization request for specific activities. So long as the \n10  activities for which a State requests authorization meet the minimum standards and \n11  requirements to be funded by NEVI Formula Program funds, see 23 C.F.R. Part 680, the \n12  FHWA must approve State’s requests for authorization. Upon FHWA authorization, NEVI \n13  Formula Program funds are obligated for those activities. When the State submits to the \n14  FHWA expenses incurred for those activities, it can draw down the obligated funds, which are \n15  then disbursed into State accounts. The FHWA’s authority to withhold or withdraw those \n16  funds is tightly conscribed by the IIJA. \n17  52.  By way of analogy, the amounts made “available for obligation” are like the \n18  credit limit on a credit card; the obligation is the swipe of the credit card at a point-of-sale \n19  device; and the disbursement is the transfer of funds to pay the bill. \n20 \nC.  Congress Expressly Prescribed the Circumstances and Procedures Under Which \nthe Federal Highway Administration is Authorized to Withhold or Withdraw NEVI \n21 \nFormula Program Funds from States \n22  53.  Congress expressly limited the Secretary’s discretion to withhold or withdraw \n23  NEVI Formula Program funds from States. The Secretary must distribute to each State its \n24  share of NEVI Formula Program funds unless the State fails to timely submit its State Electric \n \n25 \n5 See, e.g., FHWA Letter to Washington State, Approval of Washington State Electric Vehicle \nInfrastructure Deployment Plan (September 14, 2022), a true and accurate copy of which is attached hereto as \n26 \nExhibit B. \n \nCOMPLAINT  10  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 12 of 61\n \n1  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan or if the Secretary “determines a State has not taken \n2  action to carry out its [State P]lan.” 135 Stat. at 1422. \n3  54.  In addition to clear substantive parameters, Congress imposed strict procedural \n4  requirements the Secretary must follow: “[P]rior to the Secretary making a determination that a \n5  State has not taken actions to carry out its plan, the Secretary shall notify the State, consult \n6  with the State, and identify actions that can be taken to rectify concerns, and provide at least 90 \n7  days for the State to rectify concerns and take action to carry out its [State P]lan.” Id. Then, if \n8  the Secretary still makes a determination that the State has not taken actions to carry out its \n9  State Plan, the Secretary must give additional notice and an opportunity to be heard before \n10  withholding or withdrawing any funds: “The Secretary shall provide notice to a State on the \n11  intent to withhold or withdraw funds not less than 60 days before withholding or withdrawing \n12  any funds, during which time the State[] shall have an opportunity to appeal a decision to \n13  withhold or withdraw funds directly to the Secretary.” Id. \n14  55.  To further cement that NEVI Formula Program funds must be distributed for the \n15  purpose of building EV charging infrastructure, the IIJA expressly mandates that the Secretary \n16  redistribute all funds lawfully withheld or withdrawn from a State in a given fiscal year to \n17  other jurisdictions. To redistribute withheld or withdrawn funds, the Secretary may “award \n18  such funds on a competitive basis to local jurisdictions within the State for use on projects that \n19  meet the eligibility requirements.” Id. If the Secretary cannot fully award these funds to local \n20  jurisdictions within the State, “any such funds remaining shall be distributed among other \n21  States . . . in the same manner as funds distributed for that fiscal year.” Id. at 1422-23 \n22  (emphasis added). Whatever the scenario, the NEVI Formula Program funds appropriated by \n23  Congress must always be distributed to support State or local government EV charging \n24  infrastructure projects. \n25  56.

If a State submits a \n2  Plan by the deadline, the FHWA must provide that State with its share of NEVI Formula \n3  Program funds for the fiscal year(s) covered by that Plan unless the State fails to take action to \n4  carry out the Plan and the Secretary follows the required statutory procedures, including but \n5  not limited to notice and an opportunity to appeal prior to any redistribution of the funds.  \n6 \nD.  Plaintiff States Submitted State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \nfor Fiscal Years 2022 through 2025, and the Federal Highway Administration Made \n7 \nNEVI Formula Program Funds Available for Obligation \n8  57.  Consistent with the IIJA, the deadlines established by the Secretary, and the \n9  NEVI Formula Program Guidance, States prepared and submitted to the FHWA their State \n10  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans describing how they intended to use their \n11  share of funds to carry out the NEVI Formula Program. The FHWA approved the States’ Plans \n12  making their shares of NEVI Formula Program funds available to the States for obligation.  \n13  58.  In total, as of February 6, 2025, the FHWA made $3.27 billion available for \n14  obligation for fiscal years 2022 through 2025, including approximately $1.1 billion made \n15  available for obligation to Plaintiff States.6 \n16  59.

The Unleashing American Energy Executive Order  \n6  96.  On January 20, 2025, the President issued an executive order entitled \n7  Unleashing American Energy. Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353.  \n8  97.  In the Executive Order, the President declared it “the policy of the United States \n9  to ‘eliminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate’ and promote true consumer choice, which is \n10  essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor \n11  vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by \n12  terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-\n13  powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-\n14  conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and \n15  effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities \n16  alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable.” Id.  \n17  98.  To “[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal,” and effectuate his own policy priorities, \n18  including the “eliminat[ion of] the electric vehicle (EV) mandate,” the President ordered all \n19  agencies to “immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through . . . [IIJA], \n20  including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through \n21  the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program.” Id. at 8357.  \n22  99.  The President further directed all agencies to “review their processes, policies, \n23  and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such \n24  appropriated funds for consistency with the law and [the President’s energy policy priorities] \n25  outlined in section 2 of the [Executive Order].” Id. \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  19  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 21 of 61\n \n1  100.  The President also ordered agency heads to submit to the Directors of OMB and \n2  the National Economic Council (“NEC”) a report detailing the agencies’ review, including \n3  “recommendations to enhance their alignment with [the President’s energy policy priorities] \n4  set forth in section 2.” The President made clear that agencies were not to disburse any funds \n5  appropriated under the IIJA “until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for \n6  Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review \n7  recommendations they have chosen to adopt.” Id.  \n8  101.  In short, the President directed agencies to withhold congressionally \n9  appropriated funds, including NEVI Formula Program funds, as a tool to terminate programs \n10  the President dislikes.  \n11  102.  But agencies have no authority to rescind or revise statutes, or to withhold funds \n12  duly appropriated by Congress based on the President’s disagreement with the policies and \n13  priorities of Congress.  \n14  103.  Indeed, several federal district courts have already enjoined agency actions \n15  effectuating the President’s directive to withhold IIJA and IRA funds as ultra vires, contrary to \n16  law, and arbitrary and capricious. See State of New York v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00039-JJM-\n17  PAS, ECF No. 161 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025) (granting preliminary injunction against categorical \n18  freezes of obligated funds); Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v.

The Federal Highway Administration Implemented the President’s Directive by \nRetroactively and Unlawfully Revoking All State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n23 \nDeployment Plan Approvals \n24  104.  Consistent with the President’s directive to illegally withhold all IIJA funding, \n25  including NEVI Formula Program funds, on February 6, 2025, the FHWA informed States that  \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  20  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 22 of 61\n \n1  the current NEVI Formula Program Guidance and all prior versions were rescinded. A true and \n2  accurate copy of the FHWA Letter is attached hereto as Exhibit D.  \n3  105.  The FHWA gave no rationale for rescinding the NEVI Formula Program \n4  Guidance, other than stating that the “new leadership” at the U.S. DOT had “decided to review \n5  the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program.” \n6  106.  The FHWA Letter further stated that the “FHWA is updating the NEVI Formula \n7  Program Guidance to align with current U.S. DOT policy and priorities, including those set \n8  forth in DOT Order 2100.7.” A true and accurate copy of DOT Order 2100.7 is attached hereto \n9  as Exhibit E. \n10  107.  Unlike the factors Congress enumerated in the IIJA to inform the Secretary’s \n11  development of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, such as “the distance between publicly \n12  available electric vehicle charging infrastructure,” “connections to the electric grid,” and \n13  “long-term operation and maintenance,” 135 Stat. at 1423, DOT Order 2100.7 requires the \n14  U.S. DOT—and therefore the FHWA—to, for example, “prioritize projects and goals \n15  that . . . give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national \n16  average . . . .” \n17  108.  In the FHWA Letter, the FHWA suggests that it “aims to have [an] updated \n18  draft NEVI Formula Guidance published for public comment in the spring.” The Agency states \n19  it will, at some unknown date, after the close of a public comment period of unknown length \n20  “publish updated final NEVI Formula Guidance that responds to comments received.”  \n21  109.  Without citing any legal authority, the FHWA further explains that “[a]s a result \n22  of the rescission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, [the] FHWA is also immediately \n23  suspending the approval of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment [P]lans for all \n24  fiscal years. Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI \n25  Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new \n26  State [P]lans are submitted and approved.” \n \nCOMPLAINT  21  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 23 of 61\n \n1  110.  By announcing that the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance—if it \n2  ever comes—will include “[i]nstructions for the submission of new State [P]lans for all fiscal \n3  years,” the FHWA made clear it has no intention of reapproving any previously approved plan. \n4  The FHWA’s so-called “suspension” is therefore a revocation of all prior State Plan approvals. \n5  111.  The FHWA’s actions are consistent with multiple executive orders that \n6  demonstrate that this Administration’s policy goals conflict with the NEVI Formula Program \n7  itself, and the recission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance represents mere pretext for \n8  the FHWA’s real objective—implementing the President’s directive to illegally withhold \n9  NEVI Formula Program funds. \n10  112.  In the Executive Order, the President declared it the policy of the United States \n11  to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate,” including, in the words of the order, any \n12  “unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor \n13  EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, \n14  90 Fed. Reg. at 8353. The President’s explicit directive to withhold funds “for electric vehicle \n15  charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula \n16  Program” indicates he considers federal assistance for the construction of EV charging \n17  infrastructure—despite that being Congress’s express objective—to represent one such \n18  “market distortion.” The President’s anti-EV pronouncements likewise include his declaration \n19  of an unfounded national “energy emergency,” announcing the Administration’s focus on \n20  prioritizing and maximizing the nation’s use of fossil fuels, Exec. Order No. 14,156, 90 Fed. \n21  Reg. 8433 (Jan. 29, 2025), and his denouncement of state policies that “burden[]” the “use” of \n22  domestic oil resources in the Protecting American Energy from State Overreach executive \n23  order, Exec. Order No. 14,260, 90 Fed. Reg 15513 (Apr 14, 2025). \n24  113.  The President directed the FHWA to unlawfully withhold funds for “electric \n25  vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n26  Formula Program.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357. The FHWA lacks authority \n \nCOMPLAINT  22  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 24 of 61\n \n1  under the IIJA to withhold NEVI Formula Program funds from States except in the exclusive \n2  circumstances expressly set forth by Congress in the IIJA. It thus contrived a way to implement \n3  the President’s directive—in direct conflict with the statute and without lawful and reasoned \n4  explanation for its actions.  \n5 \nG.  Unlawfully Revoking All State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \nApproval Harms Plaintiff States \n6 \n114.  The FHWA’s retroactive and unlawful revocation of all State Electric Vehicle \n7 \nInfrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and illegal withholding or withdrawing of statutorily \n8 \nappropriated and apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds “made available to [a State] for \n9 \nobligation” has harmed and will continue to harm Plaintiff States and their residents in myriad \n10 \nways.  \n11 \n115.  In total, the FHWA is withholding approximately $2.74 billion of the $3.27 \n12 \nmillion in NEVI Formula Program funds available to the States for obligation for fiscal years \n13 \n2022 through 2025. Collectively, Plaintiff States have been immediately and indefinitely \n14 \ndeprived of access to approximately $1 billion in available NEVI Formula Program funds for \n15 \nthose four fiscal years. \n16 \nWashington \n17 \n116.  Washington, through the WSDOT, was apportioned under the NEVI Formula \n18 \nan approximate total of $71 million in funds over five years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI \n19 \nFormula Program. Washington’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 \n20 \nthrough 2025 (approximately $55 million) were made available to Washington to obligate \n21 \nupon FHWA approval of Washington’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \n22 \ncovering those fiscal years.  \n23 \n117.  Washington is a national leader in electric vehicles, remaining in the top five for \n24 \nEV adoption for more than a decade. The State has proactively invested in EV charging \n25 \ninfrastructure for many years to reduce the environmental effects of the transportation sector. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT  23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 25 of 61\n \n1  118.  Transportation is the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington, \n2  contributing approximately twenty-two percent (22%) of total air pollution and thirty-nine \n3  percent (39%) of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions throughout the State. Pollution from \n4  combustion engine vehicle emissions causes health problems, such as cancer and asthma, and \n5  contributes to climate change.  \n6  119.  To help combat climate change and protect the health and welfare of its \n7  residents, Washington has adopted zero-emission vehicle standards that require a percentage of \n8  the vehicles sold in Washington to be zero emissions, starting with the 2025 model year. The \n9  State has also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards, which increases zero \n10  emissions vehicle sales of passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles to one-\n11  hundred percent (100%) by 2035. \n12  120.  In response to the FHWA’s unlawful revocation of its State Electric Vehicle \n13  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and its unlawful withholding of NEVI Formula \n14  Program funds to implement the President’s directive, Washington was forced to cease work \n15  related to the NEVI Formula Program.  \n16  121.  In October 2024, WSDOT issued a notice of funding opportunity (“NOFO”) \n17  and request for proposals (“RFP”) for up to $25 million in projects funded through the NEVI \n18  Formula Program for EV charging infrastructure along five key corridors (I-90, US-97, US-2, \n19  US-195, and US-395). The NOFO/RFP closed on January 31, 2025. WSDOT received 40 \n20  proposals but because Washington does not have funds to cover these projects in the absence \n21  of its share of the NEVI Formula Program funding, the State has not been able to select a \n22  single awardee.  \n23  122.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, the State of Washington has been \n24  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $55 million if its available \n25  NEVI Formula Program funds that Congress expressly directed toward to the State to build out \n26  its EV charging infrastructure. All current and future NEVI Formula Program NOFOs, RFPs, \n \nCOMPLAINT  24  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 26 of 61\n \n1  and all proposed EV charging infrastructure projects in Washington are therefore on hold \n2  indefinitely. The FHWA’s unlawful actions thus create costly delays in project implementation \n3  and erode industry confidence in Washington’s ability to fund EV charging infrastructure \n4  projects, which will hamper the State’s ability to find project partners in the future.  \n5  123.  The FHWA’s unlawful actions to revoke Washington’s State Electric Vehicle \n6  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and withhold the State’s share of available NEVI \n7  Formula Program funds significantly impede Washington’s ability to develop a statewide \n8  network of EV charging infrastructure. Widespread, publicly accessible, and reliable EV \n9  charging infrastructure is critical to promote EV adoption and ensure the success of \n10  Washington’s clean car programs, which aim to improve air quality and combat climate change \n11  to protect the health and the welfare of its residents. \n12  California \n13  124.  California, through Caltrans, was apportioned a total of approximately $384 \n14  million in funds over five fiscal years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. \n15  California’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 \n16  (approximately $302 million) was made available to California to obligate upon the FHWA’s \n17  approval of California’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those \n18  fiscal years. \n19  125.  Caltrans and CEC jointly implement the State’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n20  Deployment Plans to support California’s environmental, public health, and transportation \n21  policies. California’s efforts to promote the widespread adoption of zero-emitting EVs are \n22  critical to its Climate Change Scoping Plan, developed to meet the California Legislature’s \n23  GHG reduction targets, and its attainment of federal ambient air quality standards, which \n24  require significant measures to reduce smog precursors like nitrogen oxides and particulate \n25  matter. Failure to attain and maintain these ambient concentrations not only increases the \n26  public health risks, including cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, it also risks \n \nCOMPLAINT  25  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 27 of 61\n \n1  noncompliance penalties to the State, including the loss of highway funds. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7409, \n2  7410, 7509(b); 89 Fed. Reg. 16,202, 16,223-49 (Mar. 6, 2024) (detailing health effects of \n3  particulate matter); 83 Fed. Reg. 17,226, 17,232-46 (Apr. 18, 2018) (health effects of nitrogen \n4  oxides). \n5  126.  Under California’s Assembly Bill 118, which created the Clean Transportation \n6  Program administered by CEC, CEC prepares an annual Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure \n7  Plan setting forth the State’s goals for the charging and fueling infrastructure for zero-emission \n8  vehicles (including EVs) that will support the State’s climate and air pollution policies, and \n9  CEC’s strategies for building out that infrastructure. In the 2024 Zero-Emission Vehicle \n10  Infrastructure Plan, CEC projected 7.1 million plug-in passenger EVs in California in 2030 and \n11  15.2 million in 2035.  \n12  127.  The EV charging infrastructure needed to support California drivers is \n13  significant. Fast charging is particularly important along long-distance travel corridors, where \n14  drivers place a premium on quickly recharging their vehicles for the next leg of their journey. \n15  California’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans and its Zero-Emission \n16  Vehicle Infrastructure Plans thus focus NEVI Formula Program funds on building out a \n17  statewide network of fast charging ports along major travel corridors. CEC estimates that \n18  NEVI Formula Program funds will support the deployment of roughly 7,500 charging ports by \n19  2030.  \n20  128.  These fast charging ports serve a demand for EV charging infrastructure that \n21  would otherwise have to be met by a substantially larger number of slower Level 2 charging \n22  ports. A 2023 modeling analysis showed that if California builds out 63,000 additional fast \n23  charging ports, 400,000 fewer Level 2 charging ports are needed to meet the State’s EV \n24  demand by 2030. Without its share of NEVI Formula Program funds, the success of \n25  California’s zero-emission transportation policies will be seriously impeded, and California \n26  will be forced to identify other, less cost-effective funding sources. \n \nCOMPLAINT  26  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 28 of 61\n \n1  129.  In October 2023, CEC opened its first solicitation for NEVI Formula Program \n2  funded projects in California. That first solicitation closed in September 2024 with awards \n3  totaling $36.6 million to fund projects along the State’s busiest transportation corridors. Most \n4  of the awards from that solicitation have been finalized in award agreements executed between \n5  CEC and the awardees. A second solicitation closed in March 2025, and application evaluation \n6  is underway. A third round of solicitation is slated to open later this year. \n7  130.  EV charging infrastructure projects funded through the NEVI Formula Program \n8  in California generally proceed in three phases: “preliminary engineering,” “right of way,” and \n9  “construction.” Several California awardees from the first NEVI Formula Program solicitation \n10  are ready to move into their construction phases; others are proceeding with environmental \n11  reviews and obtaining necessary rights of way. These awardees have expressed concern to \n12  Caltrans and CEC that the actions announced in the FHWA Letter will prevent them from \n13  being reimbursed for their costs, and they have therefore delayed proceeding with construction. \n14  131.  One awardee has requested to withdraw its project because the FHWA is \n15  withholding NEVI Formula Program funding. If the awardee withdraws, the charging project it \n16  proposed will be delayed significantly, if not abandoned altogether. \n17  132.  Another awardee reported to CEC that it had letters of intent or memoranda of \n18  understanding with several site hosts—i.e., locations where the awardee could build a charging \n19  station—but those site hosts decided not to enter into site host agreements once they learned \n20  the FHWA was withholding California’s NEVI Formula Program funds. This too will result in \n21  the delay or possible failure of that project. \n22  133.  The withholding of NEVI Formula Program funds threatens the successful \n23  execution of grant agreements with the awardees of California’s second solicitation and will \n24  likely result in potential applicants declining to participate in the third solicitation at all. \n25  134.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful revocation of State Electric Vehicle \n26  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and illegal withholding of NEVI Formula Program \n \nCOMPLAINT  27  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 29 of 61\n \n1  funds, California has been immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately \n2  $300 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds that Congress expressly directed \n3  toward to the State to build out its EV charging infrastructure. \n4  135.  The FHWA confirmed the effect of its action in denying Caltrans’s request to \n5  obligate funds for construction of a charging station in San Diego. In an email dated March 31, \n6  2025, the FHWA notified Caltrans that “[a]s a result of the February 6[th] [NEVI Notice],” “no \n7  funds are available for obligation.” A true and accurate copy of this email is attached hereto as \n8  Exhibit F.  \n9  Colorado \n10  136.  Colorado, through CDOT, was apportioned approximately $57 million in funds \n11  over five years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. Colorado’s annual shares \n12  of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 were made available to \n13  Colorado to obligate upon FHWA approval of Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n14  Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. CEO has contracted with CDOT to implement \n15  projects for the first four fiscal years of apportioned funding, representing approximately $44.5 \n16  million. \n17  137.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s approval of its Plans, which, consistent with \n18  the IIJA, NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the FHWA’s representations, made NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds available for obligation until expended, Colorado has awarded \n20  approximately $33 million for approved projects. It has contractual obligations with awardees \n21  for $18 million. However, the FHWA has only distributed $8 million in NEVI Formula \n22  Program funds to Colorado. The FHWA is now unlawfully and indefinitely withholding \n23  Colorado’s remaining NEVI Program Formula funds on the basis of its illegal revocation of \n24  Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals. \n25  138.  Colorado has long supported the deployment of EVs and other zero-emission \n26  vehicles (ZEVs) across multiple vehicle classes as a means of reducing the environmental \n \nCOMPLAINT  28  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 30 of 61\n \n1  effects of the transportation sector and achieving its State GHG reduction targets. \n2  139.  Widespread EV adoption is limited by the availability of publicly accessible EV \n3  charging ports. As a result, Colorado State agencies, local governments, nonprofits, and the \n4  private sector have been collaborating to fund, construct, and operate more than 1,500 Level 2 \n5  and fast charging ports across the State over the past decade. Colorado intended to utilize the \n6  additional funding appropriated by Congress and apportioned to the States under the NEVI \n7  Formula Program to deploy EV charging infrastructure in the gaps remaining in its charging \n8  station network, including in rural and other underserved communities. Colorado also intended \n9  to upgrade existing charging ports in need of greater capacity and address the growing demand \n10  for charging in parts of the State that already see higher EV adoption and usage. Finally, \n11  Colorado expected to use its share of NEVI Formula Program funding to help lay the \n12  groundwork for future charging projects focused on medium- and heavy-duty commercial \n13  users. \n14  140.  The FHWA’s unlawful actions to revoke Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle \n15  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and its unlawful withholding of NEVI Formula \n16  Program funds significantly impedes Colorado’s ability to develop a statewide network of EV \n17  charging stations. Such a network is necessary to promote EV adoption as required by \n18  Colorado’s legislature and executive branch, which have enacted ambitious emissions \n19  reduction goals for the transportation sector. The FHWA’s unlawful actions interfere with \n20  existing projects, and sow uncertainty that undermines confidence in Colorado’s ability to fund \n21  EV charging infrastructure projects and creates costly delays in project implementation.   \n22  Arizona \n23  141.  Arizona, through ADOT, was apportioned an approximate total of $76 million \n24  over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. Arizona’s shares of \n25  NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $60 million) \n26  were made available to Arizona to obligate upon FHWA’s approval of Arizona’s State Electric \n \nCOMPLAINT  29  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 31 of 61\n \n1  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. \n2  142.  Transportation was the single largest contributing factor to GHG emissions in \n3  Arizona in 2021. As a result, Arizona has prioritized public fleet electrification and developing \n4  publicly available EV charging infrastructure. These two initiatives are estimated to reduce \n5  cumulative GHG emissions by almost 3 million metric tons between 2025 and 2050. Funding \n6  from the NEVI Formula Program is critical to achieving these emission-reduction goals. \n7  143.  On January 19, 2025, ADOT issued a solicitation for 35 prospective EV \n8  charging station locations identified in its 2023 and 2024 State Plans. ADOT spent a \n9  significant amount of funds and staff time preparing this solicitation, which it had to canceled \n10  after the FHWA announced its unlawful actions.  \n11  144.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Arizona has been immediately and \n12  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $48 million of its available NEVI Formula \n13  Program funds. \n14  District of Columbia \n15  145.  The District of Columbia, through DDOT, was apportioned approximately \n16  $16.7 million over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. The \n17  District’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 \n18  (approximately $13 million) were made available to the District to obligate upon FHWA’s \n19  approval of the District’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those \n20  fiscal years.  \n21  146.  The District acted in reliance on the FHWA complying with the IIJA to obligate \n22  and disburse the District’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds to build a robust, reliable, \n23  and interconnected charging network across all eight District Wards to promote EV adoption.  \n24  147.  Specifically, DDOT planned to build out a reliable network of NEVI Formula \n25  Program compliant fast charging stations, to install at least one fast charging station in each \n26  Ward, and to have a robust stakeholder and public engagement to help identify additional \n \nCOMPLAINT  30  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 32 of 61\n \n1  regional priorities and how best to use any remaining NEVI Formula Program funds.  \n2  148.  As a direct result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, the District has been \n3  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $9.5 million of its available \n4  NEVI Formula Program funds, and its ability to develop a District-wide network of EV \n5  charging stations and help support develop a local workforce with experience in EV charging \n6  infrastructure installation, maintenance, and repair has been significantly impeded. \n7  Delaware \n8  149.  The transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in Delaware. \n9  One of the commitments of Delaware’s Climate Action Plan is to minimize transportation \n10  related emissions and transition to vehicles reliant on clean and renewable energy. This goal, \n11  along with federal investment in EVs and their charging stations, will increase Delaware’s \n12  resiliency to the damaging environmental effects of climate change, reduce harmful emissions, \n13  and create a network of accessible EV charging infrastructure that is accessible to everyone in \n14  the State. \n15  150.  Delaware’s General Assembly has enacted statutory provisions for sharing State \n16  vehicle charging infrastructure, 29 Del. C. Section 8062, an electric vehicle rebate program, \n17  Section 8064, and incentives to residential users to install chargers, Section 8065.  \n18  151.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Delaware has been immediately \n19  and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $3.8 million of its available NEVI \n20  Formula Program funds and its ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations \n21  has been seriously impeded. \n22  Hawaiʻi \n23  152.  Hawaiʻi, through Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation, (“HDOT”), was \n24  apportioned approximately $18 million over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula \n25  Program’s goals.  \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  31  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 33 of 61\n \n1  153.  Hawai‘i has long been a leader in EV adoption, which is essential to reducing \n2  GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. For example, charging sessions at the \n3  Kahului station and Aloha Tower station—built using NEVI Formula Program funds—\n4  providing approximately 806,912 kWh roughly translates to a reduction of nearly 528,000 \n5  kilograms of GHGs omitted into the atmosphere. That amount of GHG emission reduction is \n6  equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 14,600 trees.  \n7  154.  Hawaiʻi relies on the NEVI Formula Program funds apportioned to the State to \n8  help transition to a sustainable transportation future and meet the State’s renewable energy \n9  goals by increasing availability of fast, affordable, and dependable EV charging.  \n10  155.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Hawaiʻi has been immediately and \n11  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $2 million of its available NEVI Formula \n12  Program funds and its ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations has been \n13  significantly impeded. \n14  Illinois \n15  156.  Illinois’s State Plans detail the State’s approach to expending its total share of \n16  the NEVI Formula Program funds to build out an EV charging network in service of the State’s \n17  goal of one million EVs on the road by 2030. 20 ILCS 627/45(a)(1). \n18  157.  Through IDOT, Illinois has contractual obligations for $25.4 million for \n19  approved NEVI Formula Program funded projects. IDOT is currently evaluating applications \n20  from a NOFO that closed on January 31, 2025, and intends to award up to $24 million to \n21  complete build out of EV charging infrastructure along Illinois’s AFCs. Additionally, IDOT is \n22  in final negotiations with a consultant to assist with construction oversight of awarded and \n23  obligated NEVI Formula Program funded projects. To pay for these consultant services and \n24  proceed with EV charging infrastructure projects, IDOT will need to obligate additional NEVI \n25  Formula Program funds, which the FHWA is unlawfully withholding. \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 34 of 61\n \n1  158.  Consistent with the IIJA and the FHWA’s representations, IDOT has acted in \n2  reliance on NEVI Formula Program funding to cover contractual obligations related to EV \n3  charging infrastructure projects. Illinois does not have funds to cover these projects in the \n4  absence of its share of the NEVI Formula Program funding. To date, the FHWA has not \n5  distributed any NEVI Formula Program funds to IDOT. \n6  Maryland \n7  159.  In 2020, transportation was the source of over one third of Maryland’s GHG \n8  emissions and a significant source of the air pollutants that form smog. Maryland is committed \n9  to increasing registrations of EVs to address these pollution issues and the State has seen \n10  tremendous growth in the number of registered EVs over the past five years from 14,930 EVs \n11  in 2020 to 132,973 EVs to date in 2025—an increase of 891 percent (891%). The State \n12  envisions further growth in EV adoption over the next decade with a goal of registering 1.1 \n13  million passenger EVs by 2031 and the implementation of the State’s Advanced Clean Cars II \n14  regulation. \n15  160.  Maryland was apportioned approximately $69 million in NEVI Formula \n16  Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 and roughly $49 million of those funds were \n17  available for obligation to Maryland upon the FHWA’s approval of Maryland’s State Electric \n18  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering fiscal years 2022 through 2025. These funds \n19  would go towards completing the buildout of fast charging infrastructure along Maryland’s \n20  designated AFCs before building out Level 2 charging infrastructure in areas of the State \n21  without such infrastructure. \n22  161.  The FHWA previously authorized the obligation of approximately $14.5 million \n23  of NEVI Formula Program funds for Round 1 design-build procurement and administration, as \n24  designated in Maryland’s State Plans. Those funds will support the construction of public \n25  charging infrastructure at only 22 of the 50 sites needed to complete the State’s AFCs. \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  33  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 35 of 61\n \n1  162.  On December 17, 2024, MSHA launched its Round 2 procurement and \n2  simultaneously requested that the FHWA authorize the obligation of $475,000 to support \n3  Round 2. MSHA’s December 17, 2024, RFP was originally slated to close on March 26, 2025.  \n4  163.  As a result, however, of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Maryland has been \n5  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $34.5 million of its available \n6  NEVI Formula Program funds and the State has been forced to delay the deadline for Round 2 \n7  proposal submissions. Based on Round 1 procurement data and available market estimates, \n8  MSHA estimates that the FHWA’s withholding of its remaining NEVI Formula Program funds \n9  would jeopardize the buildout of 180 additional fast charging ports along AFCs and 1,611 \n10  additional Level 2 charging ports in Maryland communities.8 \n11  164.  The delay in Round 2 procurement is also expected to increase costs to build \n12  charging infrastructure at the 29 sites targeted by that procurement. This increase in cost will \n13  necessarily reduce the total number of charging ports that can be built at sites away from \n14  AFCs. And this reduction in charging infrastructure may, in turn, lead to reduced adoption of \n15  EVs in the State, harming Maryland’s ability to meet its emission reduction goals and \n16  implement its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation. \n17  Minnesota \n18  165.  Transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions in Minnesota. The State \n19  is seeing more frequent extreme weather events, drought, smoke from forest fires and potential \n20  loss of several species due to warming rivers and lakes as a result of climate change. To \n21  mitigate the damaging effects of climate change, MnDOT set interim GHG emissions targets in \n22  the Statewide Multimodal Transportation Plan for 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040. The Minnesota \n23  legislature updated the State goal to include interim targets, which align with the Statewide \n24  Multimodal Transportation Plan and the State’s Climate Action Framework. Minnesota’s Next \n \n25 \n8 This MSHA estimate of fast charging and Level 2 charging ports includes infrastructure planned for \ndevelopment using the funds the FHWA is currently withholding unlawfully and Maryland’s apportioned share of \n26 \nfunds for fiscal year 2026.  \n \nCOMPLAINT  34  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 36 of 61\n \n1  Generation Energy Act of 2007, Minnesota Statutes, section 216H.02 requires Minnesota to \n2  reduce GHG emissions statewide to net zero by 2050. \n3  166.  To decrease transportation sector GHG emissions, Minnesota needs to invest in \n4  a range of strategies, including vehicle electrification, increasing travel options, and low \n5  carbon infrastructure and systems management. The State identified increased EV adoption as \n6  one way to reduce GHG emissions from transportation. A reliable statewide EV charging \n7  network is required to help alleviate Minnesota residents’ range anxiety and encourage EV \n8  adoption. The FHWA’s unlawful actions jeopardize Minnesota’s ability to reduce GHG \n9  emissions from transportation and ultimately put its climate change mitigation goals at risk. \n10  167.   In reliance on the FHWA’s compliance with the IIJA, MnDOT included NEVI \n11  Formula Program funds as a set-aside in its State Transportation Improvement Program \n12  (“STIP”). The 2025-2028 STIP includes the entire $68 million in funds apportioned to \n13  Minnesota under the NEVI Formula Program. When individual projects are identified, funds \n14  are broken out from the set-aside, reviewed through Metropolitan Planning Organization \n15  (“MPO”) processes, and modified in local Transportation Improvement Plans and the STIP, \n16  before federal obligation. \n17  168.  As of January 10, 2025, the FHWA had authorized obligation of NEVI Formula \n18  Program funds for 19 projects in Minnesota. A Round 1 RFP was opened December 2023 and \n19  closed April 2024. Round 1 resulted in 12 executed contracts to build 12 EV charging stations. \n20  Work on these projects is continuing.  \n21  169.  A Round 2 RFP was opened October 2024 and closed January 2025. In April \n22  2025, MnDOT awarded an additional 12 conditional awards to build an additional 12 EV \n23  charging stations. MnDOT is taking steps towards executing contracts for these projects, which \n24  will result in a total of 24 fully executed contracts in summer 2025.  \n25  170.  As stated previously, the FHWA has only obligated funds for 19 of these 24 \n26  projects.  \n \nCOMPLAINT  35  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 37 of 61\n \n1  171.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful action, which the Agency announced just \n2  before the MPO process for the five Round 2 projects without authorized obligations was \n3  complete, Minnesota cancelled those processes. To fulfill MnDOT’s commitment to \n4  encouraging EV use as a means to combat climate change, State funds were identified to move \n5  forward with Round 2 conditional awards. \n6  172.  However, Minnesota’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Needs Assessment, which \n7  resulted in the identification of future EV charging infrastructure projects throughout \n8  Minnesota, was completed in reliance on the State receiving its entire share of NEVI Formula \n9  Program funds—all $68 million. These projects are on hold.  \n10  173.  In addition, the majority of work to establish replicable and accountable \n11  frameworks for procurement and implementation of the NEVI Formula Program has already \n12  been done. The next step is to construct the tangible benefits for the public. Should any one of \n13  the three partners (federal, state, or awardee) back out at this time, it will have been a \n14  considerable waste of public and private resources and the benefits of a reliable statewide \n15  network of EV charging infrastructure will not be realized. \n16  New Jersey \n17  174.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, New Jersey has been immediately \n18  and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $73 million of its available NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds.  \n20  175.  Relying on the FHWA’s statutory obligation to disburse NEVI Formula \n21  Program funds, the Agency’s approval of New Jersey’s State Plans, and its prior \n22  authorizations, NJDOT awarded in December 2024 a publicly advertised contract for the \n23  development, planning, design, installation, five-year operation, and maintenance of 76 NEVI \n24  Formula Program compliant EV charging stations along 19 designated AFCs. \n25  176.  In the absence of the NEVI Formula Program funds the FHWA is unlawfully \n26  withholding, NJDOT cannot move forward with this initiative, and New Jersey is impeded \n \nCOMPLAINT  36  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 38 of 61\n \n1  from meeting its EV charging infrastructure goals, which are aimed at reducing environmental \n2  harms stemming from the transportation sector. \n3  New Mexico \n4  177.  The NEVI Formula Program joined numerous other climate action efforts \n5  occurring in New Mexico. In January 2019, New Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham signed \n6  Executive Order (EO) 2019-003, announcing New Mexico will continue to support the 2015 \n7  Paris Agreement goals and setting a statewide goal to reduce GHG emissions by at least firty-\n8  five percent (45%) by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. EO 2019-003 also created the Interagency \n9  Climate Change Task Force (“CCTF”) to direct the efforts of multiple state agencies to reduce \n10  GHG emissions, improve air quality, and protect natural resources.  \n11  178.  The CCTF established ten interagency Climate Action Teams to propose, plan, \n12  and implement strategies. The CCTF has identified transportation decarbonization, including \n13  electrification, as key to reaching state GHG reduction goals. State agencies, including \n14  NMDOT, have been working together to advance decarbonization strategies, and recent \n15  successes include the May 2022 adoption of a Clean Cars Rule.  \n16  179.  As a member of the CCTF and in support of statewide goals, NMDOT is also \n17  actively working to build a climate action program that includes resiliency planning, \n18  developing carbon reduction strategies, implementing multimodal plans, and updating facilities \n19  with energy efficiency technologies and solar.  \n20  180.  The deployment of EVs and EV charging infrastructure in New Mexico will \n21  improve quality of life across the State by reducing GHG emissions and air pollution.  \n22  181.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, New Mexico has been \n23  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $18.5 million of its available \n24  NEVI Formula Program funds. Without that funding, New Mexico’s carefully planned efforts \n25  to build a network of EV charging infrastructure across the State to ensure all residents have \n26  the ability to choose an EV will be wasted and the State is unlikely to achieve its goal of \n \nCOMPLAINT  37  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 39 of 61\n \n1  building a future transportation system that serves all its people, including those in \n2  disadvantaged communities.  \n3  New York \n4  182.  New York, through NYSDOT was apportioned a total of approximately $175.5 \n5  million in funds over five fiscal years (fiscal years 2022 through 2026) dedicated to carrying \n6  out the NEVI Formula Program. New York’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal \n7  years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $138 million) was made available to New York to \n8  obligate upon the FHWA’s approval of New York’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n9  Deployment Plans covering those first four fiscal years. \n10  183.  NYSDOT engaged the Power Authority of New York to perform the first set of \n11  NEVI Formula Program funded projects in New York. That procurement concluded on \n12  September 8, 2023, wherein NYSDOT obligated $16.1 million to fund 23 initial projects along \n13  some of the State’s busiest transportation corridors. Eleven stations are operational and the \n14  remaining 12 stations are in development.  \n15  184.  NYSDOT also engaged the New York State Energy Research and Development \n16  Authority (“NYSERDA”) to conduct two solicitations for the next stage of NEVI Formula \n17  Program funded projects in New York.  \n18  185.  NYSERDA issued its first competitive solicitation, Program Opportunity Notice \n19  (“PON”) 5865, in September 2024 calling for proposals to develop fast charging stations along \n20  designated AFCs in New York with a focus on areas north of and including I-84. PON 5865 \n21  made $21.5 million in NEVI Formula Program funds available to proposers. Proposals in \n22  response to PON 5865 were received by December 4, 2024. NYSERDA’s evaluation of PON \n23  5865 proposals is complete. \n24  186.  In December 2024, NYSERDA issued a second solicitation for NEVI Formula \n25  Program funded fast charging station proposals, PON 5866, which focused on the areas around \n26  New York City, Long Island, and the lower Hudson Valley. PON 5866 made $28.5 million in \n \nCOMPLAINT  38  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 40 of 61\n \n1  NEVI Formula Program funds available to proposers. Proposals in response to PON 5866 were \n2  received by March 18, 2025. NYSERDA’s evaluation of PON 5866 proposals is in progress.  \n3  187.  On or about April 28, 2025, NYSDOT reviewed its unobligated NEVI Formula \n4  Program fund balance—estimated to be approximately $120 million for fiscal years 2022 \n5  through 2025 as NYSDOT had obligated approximately $17.7 million of its apportionment for \n6  those years as of that date—and discovered such funds unavailable for obligation in the FHWA \n7  portal.  \n8  188.  As a direct result of the FHWA’s actions, New York has been immediately and \n9  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $120 million of its available NEVI Formula \n10  Program funds, NYSDOT and NYSERDA cannot move forward under the two recently issued \n11  PONs, and all future uses of NEVI Formula Program funding are now on hold indefinitely.  \n12  189.  NEVI Formula Program funded EV charging infrastructure projects are critical \n13  to the economy and health of New York by broadening the availability of charging for all \n14  makes and models of EVs, addressing climate change, and protecting the health and welfare of \n15  New York’s residents. \n16  Oregon \n17  190.  Oregon, through ODOT, was apportioned approximately $52 million in funds \n18  over five fiscal years (fiscal years 2022 through 2026) dedicated to carrying out the NEVI \n19  Formula Program. Oregon’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 \n20  through 2025 (approximately $41 million) were made available to Oregon to obligate upon the \n21  FHWA’s approval of Oregon’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \n22  covering those fiscal years. \n23  191.  For nearly 20 years, Oregon has actively pursued multi-pronged strategies to \n24  reduce harmful GHG emissions in the State. In 2019, the Oregon Legislature passed Senate \n25  Bill 1044, setting specific light-duty vehicle electrification goals for the State. The legislation \n26  established the following goals: 250,000 registered zero-emission vehicles by 2025, over one \n \nCOMPLAINT  39  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 41 of 61\n \n1  million by 2030 (50% of new vehicle sales), and 2.5 million by 2035 (90% of new vehicle \n2  sales). Installing publicly available EV charging stations throughout the State is essential for \n3  Oregon to meet its electrification goals. Oregon has determined it needs 8,000-13,000 public \n4  fast charging ports and 12,000-50,000 public Level 2 charging ports by 2030 to reach its \n5  goals. Oregon planned to use its NEVI Formula Program funds to develop a total of eleven \n6  AFCs, each to contain publicly accessible charging and alternative fueling infrastructure. \n7  192.  ODOT has thus far obligated approximately $26 million of its approximately \n8  $41 million in available NEVI Formula Program funds for planning, preliminary engineering, \n9  and construction phases for the installation of EV charging stations in eleven major Oregon \n10  corridors. \n11  193.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, ODOT has been immediately and \n12  indefinitely deprived of more than $12 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds. \n13  Without those funds, ODOT cannot develop eight of the eleven corridors, representing a loss \n14  of at least 40 fast charging stations, or a minimum of 160 charging ports. This accounts for \n15  roughly seventy-five percent (75%) of the estimated number of stations ODOT planned to \n16  develop. If the FHWA continues to withhold Oregon’s NEVI Formula Program funds, the \n17  State cannot move forward with the projects described in its State Plans and is highly unlikely \n18  to meet its goals of significantly reducing GHG emissions through transportation \n19  electrification. \n20  Rhode Island \n21  194.  Rhode Island’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans were \n22  designed to establish a reliable, accessible, and interconnected EV fast charging network along \n23  critical transportation corridors, beginning with the designated Alternative Fuel Corridor (I-95) \n24  and expanding statewide. The Plans aimed to reduce range anxiety, promote EV adoption, \n25  support GHG emissions reductions, prioritize investments in disadvantaged communities, and \n26  prepare the State’s workforce and infrastructure for a sustainable, zero-emission transportation \n \nCOMPLAINT  40  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 42 of 61\n \n1  future. Each Plan was sequentially structured to build upon prior progress, moving from AFC \n2  compliance to equitable and sustainable statewide EV infrastructure expansion. \n3  195.  During Phase 1, for AFC buildout, infrastructure was deployed through a \n4  competitive procurement process with a selected vendor. The project was fully completed, all \n5  invoices were paid, and all contractual obligations were fulfilled. No pending invoices, \n6  encumbrances, or outstanding deliverables remain. \n7  196.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s compliance with the IIJA, the State issued a \n8  Phase 2 Request for Applications (RFA) in November 2024 to award $10 million to eligible \n9  public, tribal, higher education, and nonprofit entities. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful \n10  actions, Rhode Island halted the open Phase 2 RFA process.  \n11  197.  Forcing the closure of an active RFA period caused immediate disruption as \n12  many applicants had already initiated or completed their applications. Rhode Island has been \n13  unable to award funds to communities and public entities that invested time and resources \n14  preparing proposals.  \n15  198.  The short- and long-term harms to Rhode Island resulting from the FHWA’s \n16  unlawful actions are significant and numerous. Rhode Island has been immediately and \n17  indefinitely deprived of access to more than $16 million of its available NEVI Formula \n18  Program funds.  \n19  199.  Rhode Island is steadfast in its commitment to combat climate change and its \n20  harmful effects. To that end, the 2021 Act on Climate sets aggressive decarbonization \n21  requirements for the State. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-1, et. seq. This includes mandates that \n22  statewide GHG emissions reach forty-five percent (45%) below 1990 levels by 2030; eighty \n23  percent (80%) below 1990 levels by 2040, and that the State achieves net-zero emissions by \n24  2050. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-9. \n25  200.  In furtherance of its climate goals, Rhode Island is also firmly committed to \n26  reducing transportation-sector GHG emissions and advancing transportation electrification as a \n \nCOMPLAINT  41  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 43 of 61\n \n1  critical element of its broader climate strategy. Transportation emissions account for over thirty \n2  percent (30%) of Rhode Island’s total GHG emissions, making it the largest single source of \n3  emissions in the state. Delays in EV infrastructure deployment caused by the FHWA’s \n4  unlawful actions jeopardize the State’s ability to meet its GHG reduction mandates under the \n5  Act on Climate, as well as other regional air quality improvement goals.  \n6  201.  In addition, future EV charging infrastructure projects are likely to face \n7  increased construction, equipment, and labor costs due to inflation and ongoing supply chain \n8  instability.  \n9  202.  The uncertainty caused by the FHWA’s unlawful actions also stands to reduce \n10  the pool of capable partners willing to engage in future solicitations. Moreover, workforce \n11  development efforts, including EV technician training and pipeline programs associated with \n12  Phase 2 of the program in Rhode Island, have been delayed, undermining economic \n13  development opportunities tied to growth of the clean transportation sector. \n14  203.  Reopening or redesigning paused solicitations will also require additional State \n15  resources and will extend project delivery timelines.  \n16  Vermont \n17  204.  Vermont, through VTrans, was apportioned an approximate total of $21 million \n18  in funds over five fiscal years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. \n19  Vermont’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 were \n20  made available to Vermont to obligate upon the FHWA’s approval of its State Electric Vehicle \n21  Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. The first four fiscal years of \n22  apportioned funding equaled approximately $16.7 million. \n23  205.  Vermont has long supported the deployment of EVs and other ZEVs across \n24  multiple vehicle classes as a means of reducing the environmental effects of the transportation \n25  sector and achieving its State GHG emissions reduction targets. For example, Vermont’s \n26  Global Warming Solutions Act requires Vermont to significantly reduce GHG emissions \n \nCOMPLAINT  42  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 44 of 61\n \n1  below historic levels in the coming decades, and Vermont has prepared a Climate Action Plan \n2  to identify steps to meet those goals. Development of EV charging infrastructure to support \n3  transportation electrification is a Climate Action Plan priority. \n4  206.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s approval of its State Plans, which, consistent \n5  with the IIJA, NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the FHWA’s representations, made \n6  NEVI Formula Program funds available for obligation until expended, Vermont, among other \n7  things, awarded EV fast charging port projects totaling approximately $9.3 million. Without its \n8  NEVI Formula Program funds, Vermont cannot fund all of the projects the State has awarded.  \n9  Wisconsin \n10  207.  In response to the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Wisconsin was forced to cease \n11  work related to 15 NEVI Formula Program awards and a current RFP issued to solicit \n12  proposals for additional NEVI Formula Program funded projects.  \n13  208.  In January 2024, WisDOT issued a NOFO and RFP through the NEVI Formula \n14  Program for charging infrastructure along Wisconsin’s approved AFCs. The NOFO/RFP \n15  closed on May 23, 2024. WisDOT issued 53 awards. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful \n16  actions, WisDOT cannot take any further action on 15 of these awards, which represents \n17  approximately $7.3 million. \n18  209.  On October 14, 2024, WisDOT issued a second RFP with the intention of \n19  issuing awards in Spring 2025. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, WisDOT cannot \n20  issue any awards under this RFP. \n21  210.  WisDOT has been immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to \n22  approximately $62.65 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds. In the absence of \n23  those funds, WisDOT cannot fund the 15 projects awarded under its January 2024 RFP or issue \n24  any new awards to carry out EV charging infrastructure projects. \n25  211.  NEVI Formula Program funded EV charging infrastructure projects are critical \n26  to the economy and health of Wisconsin by broadening the availability of EV charging for all \n \nCOMPLAINT  43  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 45 of 61\n \n1  makes and models of EVs, which helps address climate change and protects the health and \n2  welfare of Wisconsin’s residents. \n3  212.  Even if the FHWA issues new final NEVI Formula Program Guidance in the \n4  very near future, Plaintiff States will shoulder the unnecessary cost and burden of developing \n5  new State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans despite having invested months \n6  and significant resources developing its previous plans. \n7  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n8 \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – In Excess of Statutory Authority \n9 \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n10  213.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n11  preceding paragraphs. \n12  214.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n13  215.  Under the APA, the court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n14  findings, and conclusions found to be . . . “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \n15  limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n16  216.  An agency may not take any action that exceeds the scope of its statutory \n17  authority. \n18  217.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n19  Defendants to suspend or revoke State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n20  approvals, either individually or categorically. \n21  218.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n22  Defendants to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds. \n23  219.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n24  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n25  220.  Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n26  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n \nCOMPLAINT  44  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 46 of 61\n \n1  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds exceed Defendants’ statutory authority and must be \n2  set aside. \n3  221.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n4  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n5  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n6  COUNT II \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious and Not in \n7 \nAccordance with Law \n8  Revocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n222.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n9 \npreceding paragraphs. \n10 \n223.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n11 \n224.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n12 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n13 \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n14 \n225.  Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the action contravenes or \n15 \notherwise fails to implement the statutory directives of Congress consistent with the statute’s \n16 \ntext, structure, and purpose. \n17 \n226.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails to articulate a \n18 \nreasoned explanation for its action, fails to consider reasonable alternatives, fails to consider \n19 \nimportant factors, and/or considers factors Congress did not intend it to consider. Agency \n20 \naction is also arbitrary and capricious if, when departing from a prior policy, an agency fails to \n21 \ndisplay awareness it is changing its position, fails to consider serious reliance interests, or fails \n22 \nto demonstrate that there are good reasons for the new policy, which also must be permissible \n23 \nunder the statute. \n24 \n227.  Agency action taken on pretextual grounds violates the APA’s requirements of \n25 \nreasoned agency decision-making. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT  45  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 47 of 61\n \n1  228.  The Defendants made no factual or legal findings, nor did they provide any \n2  reasoned basis for their actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State Electric Vehicle \n3  Deployment Plan approvals.  \n4  229.  The Defendants’ sole stated rationale for their action to “suspend” or revoke all \n5  State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals—that the recission of the NEVI Formula \n6  Program Guidance necessitated the retroactive and categorical “suspension” or revocation of \n7  all State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals—is a contrived, irrational, and \n8  insufficient explanation and thus not a reasoned basis for the action. \n9  230.  The Defendants failed to consider whether “suspending” or revoking all State \n10  Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals was consistent with the purpose and objectives of \n11  the IIJA and the NEVI Formula Program as established by Congress. \n12  231.   The Defendants failed to engage in reasoned consideration of any individual \n13  State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan before categorically “suspending” or revoking all Plan \n14  approvals and did not provide reasoned explanation for doing so.  \n15  232.  Likewise, Defendants failed to engage in reasoned, individualized consideration \n16  of any State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan or any actions taken by Plaintiff States to carry \n17  out those Plans before categorically withdrawing or withholding NEVI Formula Program \n18  funds. \n19  233.  The Defendants failed to consider obvious, reasonable, and lawful alternatives \n20  to their actions, such as complying with the requirements of the IIJA and honoring their prior \n21  approval of Plaintiff States’ State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans for fiscal \n22  years 2022 through 2025 while updating NEVI Formula Program Guidance to govern the \n23  submission of fiscal year 2026 Plans. \n24  234.  The Defendants’ stated rationale for their action to “suspend” or revoke all State \n25  Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals and their failure to consider reasonable \n26  alternatives exposes the pretextual nature of the Defendants’ actions. Upon information and \n \nCOMPLAINT  46  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 48 of 61\n \n1  belief—and as a matter of common sense—the Defendants “suspended” or revoked all State \n2  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals to implement the President’s \n3  directive to withhold funds “for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the \n4  National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” Exec. Order 14154, 90 Fed. \n5  Reg. at 8357. \n6  235.  The Defendants failed to consider Plaintiff States’ serious reliance interests, \n7  including on the FHWA’s prior approvals of their State Plans and the States’ expectation that \n8  the FHWA would distribute their NEVI Formula Program funds as required.  \n9  236.  The Defendants therefore failed to consider the consequences of categorically \n10  “suspending” or revoking approval of all State Plans and categorically withholding or \n11  withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds.  \n12  237.  The Defendants also failed to demonstrate good reasons for their change in \n13  position and their new position directly conflicts with the IIJA and is therefore impermissible \n14  under the statute. \n15  238.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n16  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n17  239.  Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n18  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n19  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds must be set aside as arbitrary, capricious, and not \n20  in accordance with law. \n21  240.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n22  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n23  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT  47  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 49 of 61\n \n1  COUNT III \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – Not in Accordance with Law and \n2 \nWithout Observance of Procedure Required By Law \n3  Withholding of Funds \n241.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n4 \npreceding paragraphs. \n5 \n242.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n6 \n243.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n7 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law . . . [or] without \n8 \nobservance of procedure required by law” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). \n9 \n244.  Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the action contravenes or \n10 \notherwise fails to implement the statutory directives of Congress consistent with the statute’s \n11 \ntext, structure, and purpose. \n12 \n245.  Judicial review of an agency’s procedural compliance is “exacting.” See Kern \n13 \nCnty. Farm Bureau v. Allen, 450 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir. 2006).  \n14 \n246.  The IIJA provides an exclusive list of circumstances in which the Defendants \n15 \nmay withhold or withdraw from a State its share of NEVI Formula Program funds for a fiscal \n16 \nyear. \n17 \n247.  The Defendants may withhold a State’s funds if it fails to timely submit a State \n18 \nElectric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan. After a State has submitted its Plan, the \n19 \nDefendants may withhold or withdraw a State’s funds for the fiscal year(s) covered by the Plan  \n20 \n \n21 \nonly after determining that the State has not taken actions to carry out that Plan, and only after \n22 \nfollowing all statutorily required procedure. \n23 \n248.  Specifically, before determining that a State has not taken actions to carry out \n24 \nits Plan, the Defendants must comply with the strict procedural requirements set out in the \n25 \nIIJA, including to “notify the State, consult with the State, and identify actions that can be \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT  48  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 50 of 61\n \n1  taken to rectify concerns, and provide at least 90 days for the State to rectify concerns and take \n2  action to carry out its plan.” 135 Stat. at 1422. \n3  249.  After making a determination that a State has not taken action to carry out its \n4  Plan, the Defendant must comply with additional procedural requirements before withholding \n5  or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds from the State. Specifically, the Defendants \n6  must give a further 60 days’ notice, an opportunity to be heard, and an opportunity to appeal \n7  before withholding or withdrawing any funds.” Id. \n8  250.  The Defendants’ action to prohibit obligations of NEVI Formula Program funds \n9  made available for obligation through the FHWA’s approval of each State’s State Electric \n10  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans constitutes a withdrawal or withholding of NEVI \n11  Formula Program funds. \n12  251.  The Defendants have therefore withdrawn and withheld NEVI Formula \n13  Program funds from Plaintiff States without making the statutorily required determination that \n14  Plaintiff States have not taken action to carry out their plans and without following any \n15  statutorily required procedure.  \n16  252.  The Defendants failed to provide notice, consult with Plaintiff States, or identify \n17  any concerns with Plaintiff States’ actions to carry out their State Electric Vehicle \n18  Infrastructure Deployment Plans. \n19  253.  The Defendants failed to provide at least 90 days for Plaintiff States to rectify \n20  any concerns, failed to provide the statutorily required 60-day notice to Plaintiff States on their \n21  intent to withhold or withdraw funds, and failed to provide any opportunity to appeal the \n22  FHWA’s decision to withhold or withdraw funds. \n23  254.  Rather than follow the procedure to withhold or withdraw funds set forth by \n24  Congress in the IIJA, the Defendants achieved their goal of withholding NEVI Formula \n25  Program funds by prohibiting new obligations on the basis of their own unlawful “suspension” \n26  or revocation of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals, which \n \nCOMPLAINT  49  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 51 of 61\n \n1  was predicated solely on their recission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance.   \n2  255.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n3  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n4  256.  Accordingly, Defendants’ action to withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula \n5  Program funds must therefore be set aside as not in accordance with law and without \n6  observance of procedure required by law.  \n7  257.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n8  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n9  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n10  COUNT IV \nViolation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine, Usurping Congressional Authority \n11 \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Prohibition on Obligations \n12 \n258.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n13 \npreceding paragraphs. \n14 \n259.  Congress possesses exclusive power to legislate. Article I, Section 1 of the \n15 \nConstitution states that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of \n16 \nthe United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” U.S. Const. \n17 \nart. I, § 1; see Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (“There is no provision in \n18 \nthe Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”).  \n19 \n260.  The Constitution also “grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \n20 \nPresident.” City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018); see \n21 \nU.S. Const. art. I, §9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending \n22 \nClause). \n23 \n261.  The Constitution strictly controls how legislation enacted by Congress and \n24 \nsigned into law by the President may be amended or repealed. Article I of the Constitution \n25 \nprescribes a “single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered[] procedure” for enacting \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT  50  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 52 of 61\n \n1  such an amendment or repeal: passage of a new bill by both houses of Congress and \n2  presentment to the President for his signature or veto. Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. \n3  Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983); see U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2, 3. The Constitution \n4  identifies specific roles for the Executive in the lawmaking process, via the Recommendation \n5  Clause and the Presentment Clause, which creates the President’s veto power; outside these \n6  roles, the Executive Branch has no authority to change the law to suit the President’s policy. \n7  U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; id. § 7, cl. 2; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, \n8  587 (1952) (“In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws \n9  are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his \n10  functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the \n11  vetoing of laws he thinks bad.”); cf. Perry v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 582 U.S. 420, 441 (2017) \n12  (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (“If a statute needs repair, there’s a constitutionally prescribed way to \n13  do it. It’s called legislation. To be sure, the demands of bicameralism and presentment are real \n14  and the process can be protracted. But the difficulty of making new laws isn’t some bug in the \n15  constitutional design: it’s the point of the design, the better to preserve liberty.”). \n16  262.  Consistent with these principles, the Executive acts at the lowest ebb of his \n17  constitutional authority and power when he acts contrary to the will of Congress by attempting \n18  to unilaterally decline to spend appropriated funds. See Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637-638 \n19  (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n20  263.  The Executive’s authority is particularly limited where, as here, Congress \n21  mandated that the Defendants disburse congressionally appropriated NEVI Formula Program \n22  funds to States in amounts in accordance with a specific formula, and the Defendants’ actions \n23  are incompatible with congressional directive. Congress established the NEVI Formula \n24  Program and appropriated funds for the express purpose of providing the States with funding \n25  for EV charging infrastructure and directed precise amounts to each State leaving no discretion \n26  for the Executive Branch with respect to those amounts.  \n \nCOMPLAINT  51  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 53 of 61\n \n1  264.  Congress has generally provided for a procedure by which the Executive may \n2  propose to Congress to either rescind or cancel funds. See Congressional Budget and \n3  Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. §§ 682 et seq. Congress also specifically \n4  prescribed the exclusive grounds for which the Defendants could withhold or withdraw NEVI \n5  Formula Program funds from a State and the procedure with which the Defendants must \n6  comply before doing so. Congress also mandated that funds lawfully withheld or withdrawn \n7  from a State be redistributed to other States and local jurisdictions for EV infrastructure \n8  development. \n9  265.  The Impoundment Control Act precludes the Executive from refusing to spend \n10  or distribute congressionally appropriated funds, instead requiring the President to “propose[]” \n11  any rescission to Congress (which Congress must then affirmatively approve). 2 U.S.C. \n12  §§ 683, 684(a). The Impoundment Control Act also does not authorize the Executive to defer \n13  funding for the reasons the Defendants invoke here. As described above, the Administration \n14  generally opposes the IIJA, and the NEVI Formula Program specifically, on policy grounds. \n15  Accordingly, the Executive’s authority is at its “lowest ebb.” See Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637-\n16  638 (Jackson, J., concurring). \n17  266.  The Defendants’ actions to “suspend” or revoke all State Electric Vehicle \n18  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds violate the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and \n20  impermissibly arrogates to the Executive legislative and spending powers reserved to \n21  Congress. \n22  267.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \n23  respect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., \n24  Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015). Plaintiff States are “entitled to invoke the equitable jurisdiction \n25  to restrain enforcement” of unconstitutional acts by federal officials. Panama Ref. Co. v.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff States are \n5  entitled to a declaration that the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n6  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n7  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the constitutional separation of powers \n8  doctrine and impermissibly arrogate to the Executive power reserved to Congress. \n9  COUNT V \nViolation of Take Care Clause  \n10 \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n11  270.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n12  preceding paragraphs. \n13  271.  The Take Care Clause provides that the Executive must “take Care that the \n14  Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; Utility Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. \n15  302, 327 (2014) (“Under our system of government, Congress makes laws and the President \n16  . . . ‘faithfully execute[s]’ them.”). \n17  272.  The Executive Branch violates the Take Care Clause where it declines to \n18  execute or otherwise undermines statutes enacted by Congress and signed into law. See In re \n19  United Mine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 F.3d 545, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[T]he President \n20  is without authority to set aside congressional legislation by executive order.”); Kendall v. \n21  United States, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838) (rejecting argument that by charging the President with \n22  faithful execution of the laws, the Take Care clause “implies a power to forbid their \n23  execution”). \n24  273.  The Defendants’ actions to carry out President Trump’s directive to \n25  “[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal,” and specifically his directive to withhold funds \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  53  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 55 of 61\n \n1   appropriated through the IIJA for EV charging infrastructure violates the Take Care Clause of \n2  the Constitution. \n3  274.  The Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State Electric \n4  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans approvals and to categorically withhold or withdraw \n5  NEVI Formula Program funds are contrary to the Executive’s duty to faithfully execute the \n6  IIJA as enacted by Congress and therefore violate the Take Care Clause.  \n7  275.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \n8  respect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. \n9  at 327. Plaintiff States are “entitled to invoke the equitable jurisdiction to restrain enforcement” \n10  of unconstitutional acts by federal officials. Panama Ref. Co., 293 U.S. at 414. Federal courts \n11  may also set aside agency action found to be “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \n12  or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n13  276.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n14  affected by the Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n15  277.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff States are \n16  entitled to a declaration that the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n17  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n18  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the Take Care Clause. \n19  COUNT VI \n20  Common Law Ultra Vires \nConduct Outside the Scope of Statutory Authority Conferred on the Executive \n21 \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n22  278.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n23  preceding paragraphs. \n24  279.  Plaintiff States have a non-statutory right of action to have action take in excess \n25  of legal authority declared unlawful. \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT  54  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 56 of 61\n \n1  280.  Agency or executive officer action taken in excess of legal authority is ultra \n2  vires. \n3  281.  A court reviewing executive action has an independent duty to determine what \n4  the law is and whether executive officers invoking statutory authority exceed their statutory \n5  power. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. at 327.  \n6  282.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n7  Defendants to suspend or revoke State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n8  approvals, either individually or categorically. \n9  283.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n10  Defendants to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds. \n11  284.  The Defendants have therefore acted contrary to law and ultra vires by \n12  categorically “suspending” or revoking all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment \n13  Plan approvals and categorically withholding or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds. \n14  285.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \n15  respect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. \n16  at 327. Plaintiff States are “entitled to invoke the equitable jurisdiction to restrain enforcement” \n17  of unconstitutional acts by federal officials. Panama Ref. Co., 293 U.S. at 414. \n18  286.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff States are entitled to a declaration that \n19  Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State Electric Vehicle \n20  Infrastructure Deployment Plans and to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula \n21  Program funds are ultra vires. \n22  / / / \n23  / / / \n24  / / / \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT  55  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 1     Filed 05/07/25     Page 57 of 61\n \n1  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n2  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff States pray that the Court: \n3  a.  Declare the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State \n4  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically \n5  withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the APA. \n6  b.  Declare the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State \n7  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically \n8  withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the separation of \n9  powers doctrine and the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n10  c.  Declare the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State \n11  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically \n12  withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds are contrary to the law, \n13  outside the Defendants’ authority, and therefore unlawful under the common law \n14  ultra vires doctrine. \n15  d.  Vacate the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke Plaintiff \n16  States’  Electric  Vehicle  Infrastructure  Deployment  Plan  approvals  and  to \n17  categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds. \n18  e.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  the  Defendants  from  “suspending”  or \n19  revoking Plaintiff States’ Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals. \n20  f.

Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Defendants from implementing or \n8  effectuating through any action the directive in the Executive Order to withhold \n9  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds in contravention of the express \n10  congressional mandates in the IIJA.  \n11  i.  Retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the orders of this Court. \n12  j.

In the interest of judicial economy and efficiency, Movants propose to \n9 \nintervene here rather than file a separate challenge to Defendants’ unlawful, indefinite \n10 \nsuspension of the NEVI Formula Program.  \n11 \nMovants are nonprofit public interest organizations working to reduce transportation-\n12 \nrelated pollution, accelerate EV adoption, and promote an equitable EV transition. Movants’ \n13 \nmembers seek to travel long distances freely, safely, and reliably in EVs without fear of being \n14 \nhindered by lack of access to charging infrastructure. NEVI investments are essential for these \n15 \nmembers and for rural, underserved, and low-income communities that rely on public charging \n16 \nto make EVs viable, support local jobs, enable safe evacuation, and cut pollution. For these \n17 \nreasons and more, Movants’ members are among the intended beneficiaries of the robust, \n18 \nreliable nationwide charging network the NEVI Formula Program was enacted to create.  \n19 \nDefendants’ indefinite suspension of the NEVI Formula Program now thwarts the \n20 \ndevelopment of that network, directly impacting Movants and their members. Because the \n21 \noutcome of this case may impair Movants’ ability to protect their interests—and because no \n22 \nexisting party adequately represents them—Movants respectfully seek intervention as of right \n23 \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 1 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 7 of 22\n \n1  under Rule 24(a)(2). In the alternative, Movants request permissive intervention under Rule \n2  24(b)(1). \n3  The Plaintiff States take no position on the motion. Defendants oppose the motion. \n4  BACKGROUND1 \n5  In 2021, Congress created and appropriated $5 billion for the NEVI Formula Program. \n6  Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat 429, 1421 (Nov. 15, 2021). Congress made this funding available to all \n7  50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (“States”) to “strategically deploy electric \n8  vehicle charging infrastructure” and “establish an interconnected network” along the nation’s \n9  highways. Id. at 1421. As a formula program, the distribution of NEVI funding is not \n10  discretionary: each fiscal year, Defendants must apportion funds based on a statutory formula, \n11  and the funds must remain available to the States until expended. Id. at 1422. \n12    Following FHWA guidance, States developed detailed annual plans (“NEVI Plans”) \n13  outlining how they would use their allocations. Dkt. #1, Compl. ¶¶57-95. After FHWA review, \n14  States began implementing those plans, selecting projects and entering agreements with \n15  Defendants to commit—or “obligate”—their funds to eligible projects. Dkt. #5, Pls.’ Mot. for \n16  Prelim. Inj. p. 19. To date, Defendants have apportioned $3.27 billion for fiscal years 2022 \n17  through 2025, of which only $526 million has been obligated. Dkt. #1, Exhibit C. \n18  On February 6, 2025, FHWA sent a letter to the States rescinding FHWA’s current and \n19  prior NEVI guidance, categorically suspending States’ NEVI Plans for fiscal years 2022-2025, \n20  and prohibiting new obligations of available but uncommitted funds—effectively freezing $2.74 \n21  billion. Dkt. #1, Exhibit D. As a direct result, States were forced to halt their implementation of \n22 \n \n23  1 Movants’ motion is based upon the specific allegations set forth in its accompanying \nComplaint-in-Intervention and the declarations cited herein.  \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 2 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 8 of 22\n \n1  the NEVI Formula Program. On May 7, 2025, a coalition of States filed a Complaint and Motion \n2  for a Preliminary Injunction. See Dkt. #1; Dkt. #5. Briefing on the Plaintiff States’ motion for a \n3  preliminary injunction is not yet complete. \n4  In the accompanying Complaint-in-Intervention, Movants now challenge the same \n5  agency actions set forth in FHWA’s February 6 Letter—namely, the nullification of approved \n6  State NEVI Plans and the prohibition on new fund obligations—as arbitrary and capricious and \n7  contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act, as unconstitutional under separation of \n8  powers and the Take Care Clause, and as ultra vires. Movants seek vacatur, as well as \n9  declaratory and injunctive relief, to void Defendants’ unlawful and indefinite suspension of the \n10  NEVI Formula Program and to restore its lawful implementation. \n11  STATEMENT OF MOVANTS’ INTERESTS AND STANDING \n12  I.  MOVANTS’ INTERESTS.  \n13  Movants include nonprofit environmental, equity, consumer, and community-based  \n14  organizations dedicated to promoting the widespread adoption of EVs and realizing their \n15  associated health, climate, economic, and equity benefits.2 Movants also work to protect their \n16  members from vehicle-related air pollution and its disproportionate impacts on underserved \n17  communities.3 Movants have a significant interest in preventing the harms posed by Defendants’ \n18  indefinite suspension of the NEVI Formula Program and in resuming its lawful implementation. \n19  Movants have long advocated for widespread EV adoption by working to reduce barriers \n20 \n21 \n \n22  2 Garcia Decl. ¶¶3, 5-6; Hammon Decl. ¶6; Levin Decl. ¶¶2, 4, 6-7; Robbins Decl. ¶8; Small \nDecl. ¶6; Smith Decl. ¶¶6-7; O.

MOVANTS HAVE STANDING.  \n8  Movants satisfy the three criteria for associational standing. Hunt v. Wash. State Apple \n9  Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). First, Movants’ members would have Article III \n10  standing to sue in their own right. As demonstrated by the more than 55 attached declarations, \n11  Defendants’ indefinite suspension of the NEVI Formula Program concretely harms Movants’ \n12  members by impeding the buildout of a nationwide EV charging network and denying them the \n13  program’s intended benefits, resulting in economic, health, consumer, and recreational injuries. \n14  Movants’ members include individuals who live, travel, or plan to travel in states across \n15  the country using EVs along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors.9 Many are motivated to drive \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19   \n4 Garcia Decl.¶¶5-8; Hammon Decl. ¶¶6-7; Levin Decl. ¶¶2, 17; Robbins Decl. ¶¶11-14; Small \n20  Decl. ¶¶7-10; Smith Decl. ¶¶9-11; O.

Courts have long held that \n12  cognizable injuries arise from the loss of an opportunity to pursue a government benefit—even if \n13  the benefit is not guaranteed—and from ongoing or threatened harm from restricted use of \n14  preferred technologies, pollution-related health risks, or risks to physical safety from \n15  environmental damage.

The State \n5  NEVI Plans include stations on Alternative Fuel Corridors that members use32 and this buildout \n6  would support members’ EV travel—making highway trips,33 longer journeys,34 and access to \n7  remote areas35 more feasible—while reducing stress,36 improving safety during evacuations,37 \n8  and addressing concerns like limited payment options at public stations.38 It would also give \n9  members the confidence to purchase an EV.39 Increased EV adoption spurred by NEVI would \n10  reduce air pollution, improving health outcomes for members with asthma and other \n11  sensitivities.40 \n12  Movants also meet the additional requirements for associational standing: The interests \n13  they seek to protect are germane to their organizational purposes—promoting EV adoption and \n14  reducing transportation-related air pollution41—and neither the claims nor the relief sought \n15 \n \n16  32 E.g., Banashek Decl. ¶11; Heyman Decl. ¶11; Rossi Decl. ¶15. \n33 E.g., Blumberg Decl. ¶7; Gaskill Decl. ¶10; Von Seggern Decl. ¶13.  \n17  34 E.g., Binder Decl. ¶¶11-12; Cruickshank Decl. ¶12; Dubaniewicz Decl. ¶12; Dunn Decl. ¶10; \nFrier Decl. ¶12; Heyman Decl. ¶11; Lawrence Decl. ¶8; Ruiz Decl. ¶11; Sharpless Decl. ¶10; \n18  Shoaff Decl. ¶¶8-9. \n35 E.g., Sharpless Decl. ¶10; Von Seggern Decl. ¶12. \n19  36 E.g., Blumberg Decl. ¶15; Caffery Decl. ¶14; D’Adamo Decl. ¶12; Dalstrom Decl. ¶11; \nDolgert Decl. ¶¶8, 10, 13; Kran-Annexstein Decl. ¶13; Timberlake Decl. ¶23; Walsh Decl. ¶16. \n20  37 E.g., Caffery Decl. ¶15; Erb Decl. ¶23; Heyman Decl. ¶12-15; Timberlake Decl. ¶24, 26. \n38 E.g., Erb Decl. ¶18.  \n21  39 E.g., Binder Decl. ¶13; Hiza Decl. ¶10; Hoffman Decl. ¶11; Koch Decl. ¶15; Pollinger Decl. \n¶¶9, 14; Robbins Decl. ¶18; Shoaff Decl. ¶10; Wermers Decl. ¶12.  \n22  40 E.g., Besa Decl. ¶9; Dubaniewicz Decl. ¶6; Lawrence Decl. ¶3; Mathieu Decl. ¶5; Ramos \nDecl. ¶¶3, 11; Ross Decl. ¶¶15, 31; Ruiz Decl. ¶3.  \n23  41 Garcia Decl. ¶¶3, 5-8; Hammon Decl. ¶¶6-9; Levin Decl. ¶¶2, 12-15, 19-23; Robbins Decl. \n¶¶2, 8, 15; Small Decl. ¶¶6-11; Smith Decl. ¶¶5-13; O.

See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343; UAW v. Brock, 477 U.S. \n2  274, 282 (1986). \n3  ARGUMENT \n4  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 provides for two types of intervention: intervention of \n5  right and permissive intervention. A court may grant a motion to intervene on either basis. See \n6  Int’l Union v. Scofield, 382 U.S. 205, 217 n.10 (1965). Rule 24 is “generally construe[d] . . . \n7  broadly in favor of proposed intervenors.” United States v. City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d 391, \n8  397 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal citations omitted). Permitting interested persons to participate \n9  serves “both efficient resolution of issues and broadened access to the courts” while also helping \n10  to prevent future related litigation. Forest Conserv. Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., 66 F.3d 1489, \n11  1496 n.8 (9th Cir. 1995). In this case, judicial economy and efficiency are best served by \n12  Movants’ intervention in this action, rather than a separate lawsuit.  \n13  Movants respectfully request intervention as of right under Rule 24(a), or alternatively, \n14  permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). \n15  I.  MOVANTS ARE ENTITLED TO INTERVENE AS OF RIGHT.  \n16  To intervene as of right under Rule 24(a), a movant must demonstrate that: (1) the \n17  application is timely; (2) the movant has a significant protectable interest relating to the property \n18  or transaction that is the subject of the action; (3) the disposition of the action may, as a practical \n19  matter, impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect its interest; and (4) the existing parties \n20  may not adequately represent the movant’s interest. Sw. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Berg, \n21  268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. 2001). Movants meet all four of these criteria.  \n22  A.  Movants’ Motion to Intervene is Timely.  \n23  To assess timeliness, courts evaluate the stage of the proceedings, the potential for \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 8 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 14 of 22\n \n1  prejudice to other parties, and the reasons for any delay in seeking intervention. United States v. \n2  Alisal Water Corp., 370 F.3d 915, 921 (9th Cir. 2004). Here, Movants have filed to intervene just \n3  15 days after the Plaintiff States filed their complaint, at a point when the litigation is still in its \n4  early stages. No hearings have been held, and no substantive rulings have been issued. In \n5  addition, Movants do not intend to participate in briefing on the Plaintiff States’ motion for a \n6  preliminary injunction. The timing of this motion will thus not prejudice any of the parties’ rights \n7  or interests. These factors collectively support a finding that the motion is timely. See Nw. Forest \n8  Res. Council v. Glickman, 82 F.3d 825, 837 (9th Cir. 1996). \n9  B.  Movants Have Significant Protectable Interests in This Action. \n10  Under Rule 24(a)(2), a movant must show that the interest asserted is protectable under \n11  some law and that there is a relationship between that interest and the claims at issue. Sierra \n12  Club v. Envt’l Prot. Agency, 995 F.2d 1478, 1481 (9th Cir. 1993). This requirement is “primarily \n13  a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned persons as \n14  is compatible with efficiency and due process.” Cnty. of Fresno v. Andrus, 622 F.2d 436, 438 \n15  (9th Cir. 1980).  \n16  Movants are public interest organizations committed to accelerating the adoption of EVs \n17  and reducing transportation-related air pollution by advancing policies that expand access to \n18  charging infrastructure.42 Their members seek access to the nationwide EV charging network the \n19  NEVI Formula Program was created to support.43 Movants therefore have a significant interest in \n20  the lawful implementation of the NEVI Formula Program. See Californians for Safe & \n21 \n22   \n42 Garcia Decl.¶¶3, 5-6; Hammon Decl. ¶6; Levin Decl. ¶¶2, 4, 6-7; Robbins Decl. ¶8; Small \n23  Decl. ¶6; Smith Decl. ¶¶6-7; O. Wilson Decl. ¶¶14-15. \n43 See generally Movants’ Decls.  \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 9 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 15 of 22\n \n1  Competitive Dump Truck Transp. v. Mendonca, 152 F.3d 1184, 1189-90 (9th Cir. 1998) \n2  (allowing union to intervene in challenge to wage laws where members had a substantial interest \n3  in receiving the affected wages). Movants also played a key role in advocating for NEVI’s \n4  inclusion in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and have participated extensively in \n5  administrative proceedings and stakeholder efforts related to its implementation. This sustained \n6  involvement reflects a direct, protectable interest sufficient to support intervention as of right. \n7  See Prete v. Bradbury, 438 F.3d 949, 954 (9th Cir. 2006); Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. v. Watt, 713 \n8  F.2d 525, 528 (9th Cir. 1983). \n9  C.  Movants’ Interests May Be Impaired as a Result of This Litigation.  \n10  Under Rule 24(a)(2), a movant must demonstrate that the disposition of the action “may \n11  as a practical matter,” impede its ability to protect its interests. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) (emphasis \n12  added). This is a “minimal” burden—intervention is appropriate where there is a possibility that \n13  denial could impair the movant’s legal interest. City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d at 401. \n14  Importantly, the inquiry “is not limited to consequences of a strictly legal nature.” Forest \n15  Conserv. Council, 66 F.3d at 1497-98.  \n16  The relief sought in Movants’ Complaint-in-Intervention is essential to safeguarding their \n17  interests, which would be directly and adversely affected if they are not permitted to participate \n18  in this litigation. Defendants’ unlawful and indefinite suspension of the NEVI Formula Program \n19  disrupts the development of a nationwide EV charging network—an outcome that directly \n20  undermines the interests of Movants and their members. Granting intervention would enable \n21  Movants to advance their strong interest in accelerating the widespread adoption of EVs, as well \n22  as to protect their members’ ability to access and rely on the charging network that the NEVI \n23  Program was designed to deliver. If intervention is denied, Movants will be unable to protect \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 10 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 16 of 22\n \n1  their interests, and those interests will necessarily be impaired.  \n2  D.  Movants’ Interests May Not Be Adequately Represented by Existing Parties. \n3    The final requirement for intervention as of right is a “minimal” showing that the existing \n4  parties to the litigation “may” not adequately represent the interests of Movants. Arakaki v. \n5  Cayetano, 324 F.3d 1078, 1086 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Trbovich v. United Mine Workers, 404 \n6  U.S. 528, 538 n.10 (1972)). In evaluating this requirement, courts assess whether: (1) an existing \n7  party “will undoubtedly make all of a proposed intervenor’s arguments;” (2) an existing party is \n8  “capable and willing to make such arguments;” and (3) a proposed intervenor “would offer any \n9  necessary elements to the proceedings” that would be neglected by an existing party. Arakaki, \n10  324 F.3d at 1086 (emphasis added).  \n11  Here, no existing party adequately represents Movants’ interests. Defendants plainly hold \n12  interests adverse to Movants. The Plaintiff States’ interests are also not coextensive with \n13  Movants’ for several reasons, each of which supports a finding of inadequate representation. \n14  First, the geographic scope of Movants’ interests is broader than that of the Plaintiff \n15  States, whose sovereign interests are confined to their individual jurisdictions. Movants include \n16  organizations with national reach and members that reside in every state as well as the District of \n17  Columbia and Puerto Rico.44 As detailed above, Movants have submitted declarations from \n18  dozens of members who travel nationwide on Alternative Fuel Corridors, demonstrating that \n19  Movants’ harms span well beyond the boundaries of the states participating in this litigation.  \n20  Second, the Plaintiff States must balance a broader range of competing interests than \n21  Movants in determining their policy and litigation positions, including cost, administrative \n22 \n23   \n44 See, e.g., Garcia Decl. ¶4; Hammon Decl. ¶5; Levin Decl. ¶¶4-5. \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 11 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 17 of 22\n \n1  resource constraints, and political pressures. Movants, by contrast, are focused specifically on \n2  accelerating EV adoption and improving access to reliable EV charging infrastructure, consistent \n3  with their organizational missions and the interests of their members. It is well established that a \n4  proposed intervenor’s narrower, more focused interests may independently support a finding of \n5  inadequate representation. See, e.g., Trbovich, 404 U.S. at 538-39; Sw. Ctr. for Biological \n6  Diversity, 268 F.3d at 823-24. \n7  Third, Movants represent the interests of members that are current or prospective EV \n8  drivers that are directly impacted by the freeze of the NEVI Formula Program. Their injuries—\n9  including reduced access to reliable public charging, delayed EV purchases, air pollution, \n10  constrained travel, and the loss of expected public investment in their communities—differ in \n11  nature and focus from the Plaintiff States’ asserted interests. The Plaintiff States’ interests center \n12  on state sovereignty and access to congressionally appropriated formula funds for not only the \n13  NEVI Formula Program but other transportation priorities that Movants may not share. For \n14  example, Movants include organizations that are actively litigating challenges to federally-\n15  funded transportation projects advanced by individual states within the Plaintiff States’ \n16  coalition.45 Cf. Idaho Farm Bureau Fed’n v. Babbit, 58 F.3d 1392, 1398 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding \n17  inadequate representation prong satisfied where movant’s prior litigation led to the challenged \n18  agency action). \n19  Finally, although a rebuttable presumption of adequate representation may arise where a \n20 \n21   \n45 See, e.g., Md. Chapter of the Sierra Club v. Fed. Highway Admin., No. 24-1447 (4th Cir. \n22  argued Jan. 28, 2025) (Sierra Club and NRDC challenge to Maryland’s planned expansion of I-\n270); Milwaukee Inner City Congregations Allied for Hope v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. 2:24-\n23  CV-01043 (E.D. Wis. filed Aug. 19, 2024) (Sierra Club challenge to Wisconsin’s planned \nexpansion of I-94). \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 12 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 18 of 22\n \n1  proposed intervenor and an existing party share the same “ultimate objective,” see Sw. Ctr. for \n2  Biological Diversity, 268 F.3d at 823 (citing Nw. Forest Res. Council, 82 F.3d at 838), that \n3  presumption is inapplicable here. Movants seek relief for their members’ injuries, including \n4  harms in states beyond those represented by Plaintiff States, demonstrating that Movants’ \n5  “ultimate objective” is distinct. And, for the reasons detailed above, “even if the presumption did \n6  apply, it is rebutted here because [Movants] and [Plaintiff States] do not have sufficiently \n7  congruent interests.” Id. \n8  Because Movants’ interests are distinct and more narrowly focused than those of the \n9  Plaintiff States, Movants easily meet the “minimal” burden to show that the Plaintiff States may \n10  not be “capable and willing” to adequately represent Movants’ particularized interests or to \n11  “undoubtedly make all of [Movants’] arguments.” Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086. Indeed, “it is not \n12  [Movants’] burden at this stage in the litigation to anticipate specific differences in trial \n13  strategy;” rather, Movants need only “show that, because of the difference in interests, it is likely \n14  that [the Plaintiff States] will not advance the same arguments as [Movants].” Sw. Ctr. for \n15  Biological Diversity, 268 F.3d at 824 (emphasis added). For these reasons, Movants’ distinct \n16  interests satisfy Rule 24(a)(2)’s requirement that existing parties may not adequately represent \n17  their interests. \n18  II.  ALTERNATIVELY, MOVANTS SATISFY THE STANDARD FOR PERMISSIVE \nINTERVENTION.  \n19 \nAlternatively, this Court should grant permissive intervention. Under Rule 24(b)(1)(B), a \n20 \ncourt may permit anyone to intervene who “has a claim or defense that shares with the main \n21 \naction a common question of law or fact.”  \n22 \nMovants’ claims, set forth in the accompanying Complaint-in-Intervention, are factually \n23 \nand legally related to the main action. Movants challenge the same agency actions as the Plaintiff \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 13 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 19 of 22\n \n1  States and seek to restore lawful implementation of the NEVI Formula Program to protect their \n2  own interests and those of their members. While Movants may present distinct arguments, their \n3  claims are unquestionably related. \n4  In addition, Movants’ focused interests in accelerating EV adoption, along with their \n5  broader geographic scope and specialized knowledge of EV policy, including the NEVI Formula \n6  Program itself, position them to meaningfully contribute to the development of a complete \n7  factual record and inform the proceedings. The Ninth Circuit has long recognized that such \n8  contributions support permissive intervention. See Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ., 552 \n9  F.2d 1326, 1329 (9th Cir. 1977); Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. 713 F.2d at 528 (noting specialized \n10  expertise and differing perspective of environmental nonprofit as a basis for intervention).  \n11  Allowing Movants to intervene here, rather than pursue a separate lawsuit concerning the \n12  same program and government action, also serves the interests of judicial economy and \n13  efficiency. Intervention avoids overlapping litigation and ensures that the Court has before it the \n14  full range of legal arguments and stakeholder perspectives necessary to resolve the case fairly \n15  and efficiently. \n16  Movants seek to intervene early in the litigation and do not seek to disrupt the existing \n17  schedule. Their participation will not unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of \n18  the original parties. Accordingly, Movants satisfy the requirements for both intervention as of \n19  right and permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(1). \n20  CONCLUSION  \n21  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Movants leave to intervene. \n22  / / / \n23  / / / \n24 \n  Earthjustice \nPUBLIC INTEREST \n810 Third Ave., Suite 610 \n25  ORGANIZATIONS’ MOTION  Seattle, WA  98104 \nTO INTERVENE  - 14 -  (206) 343-7340 \nCASE NO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n26   \n \n28 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 76     Filed 05/22/25     Page 20 of 22\n \n1 \n  I certify that this memorandum contains    \n  4,176 words, in compliance with the Local   \n2 \n  Civil Rules.   \n   \n3 \n   s/ Jan E.

INTRODUCTION \n22  In a 1995 episode of The Simpsons, Homer must cut short a tearful goodbye with his \n23  long-lost mother after her traveling companions protest that their “electric van only has 20 \n24  minutes of juice left!” The Simpsons: “Mother Simpson” (Fox television broadcast, aired Nov. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 1 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 2 of 66\n \n1  19, 1995). Some 26 years later, Congress sought to address the phenomenon that has come to be \n2  known as “range anxiety”: the unease experienced by electric vehicle (“EV”) drivers when they \n3  are unsure where the next charging station might be, and whether their car’s battery has \n4  sufficient charge to get them there. See Alexandra B. Klass, Public Utilities and Transportation \n5  Electrification, 104 Iowa L. Rev. 545, 561 (2019) (defining “range anxiety”). In the 2021 \n6  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), Pub. L. 117–58, 135 Stat. 429, 1421, Congress \n7  appropriated $5 billion to fund a National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (“NEVI”) Formula \n8  Program, the purpose of which was—and still is—“to strategically deploy electric vehicle \n9  charging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected network to facilitate data collection, \n10  access, and reliability.” Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation (“the Secretary”) to \n11  distribute this money to the states and the District of Columbia between 2022 and 2026. 135 Stat. \n12  at 1421. Congress established three specific uses for the money:  \n13  (1) the acquisition and installation of electric vehicle charging \ninfrastructure to serve as a catalyst for the deployment of such \n14  infrastructure and to connect it to a network to facilitate data \ncollection, access, and reliability; (2) proper operation and \n15  maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and \n(3) data sharing about electric vehicle charging infrastructure to \n16  ensure the long-term success of investments made [in the NEVI \nFormula Program]. \n17   \n \n18  Id. at 1421–22. \n \n19  Plaintiff States, relying on the IIJA, made plans to utilize their share of the NEVI \n20  Formula funds. States dedicated resources to EV infrastructure. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 23 (Pietz \n21  Decl.) ¶ 17; Dkt. No. 28 (Meredith Decl.) ¶ 23. They lined up private-sector partnerships, \n22  solicited bids on construction projects, and identified and secured sites where EV infrastructure \n23  would be built. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 28 ¶ 28. They prepared to put Congress’s new multibillion-\n24  dollar program to work for their residents. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 2 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 3 of 66\n \n1  But in 2025, the new Presidential administration determined that its Secretary of \n2  Transportation would disregard Congress’s mandate. Rather than distribute the Program funds as \n3  Congress commanded, the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) would “immediately pause \n4  the disbursement of funds appropriated through . . . the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \n5  (Public Law 117–58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations \n6  made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” \n7  Exec. Order No. 14154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8357 (Jan. 29, 2025). On February 6, 2025, the \n8  Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”), the agency within the Department of \n9  Transportation that had been administering the NEVI Formula Program, rescinded its \n10  administrative guidance on the program, revoked the state deployment plans for constructing EV \n11  infrastructure that had been created, implemented, and previously approved under that guidance, \n12  and, effectively, stopped distributing the Congressionally appropriated funds. See Dkt. No. 1-9 \n13  (“Biondi Letter”) at 2–3. The NEVI Formula Program, in essence, was frozen.  \n14  Sixteen states, plus the District of Columbia (“Plaintiff States” or “Plaintiffs”), sued \n15  DOT, FHWA, and the highest-ranking official from each of the two agencies (“Defendants”), \n16  asserting that the agencies’ action represented an unlawful seizure of legislative authority under \n17  the separation-of-powers doctrine enshrined in the United States Constitution and an \n18  overextension of executive authority beyond what is permitted by law. See generally Dkt. No. 1 \n19  (Complaint). Congress had directed the Secretary to distribute billions of dollars in NEVI \n20  Formula funds to the states, but now, under the President’s direction and for impermissible \n21  reasons (as explained below), he was (and is) refusing to do so. Presently before the Court is the \n22  Plaintiff States’ motion for a preliminary injunction that enjoins Defendants from three actions: \n23  (a)   Categorically ‘suspending’ or revoking approvals of \nPlaintiff States’ State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n24  Deployment Plans; \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 3 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 4 of 66\n \n1  (b)   Withholding or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program \nFunds for any reason not set forth in the IIJA or applicable \n2  FHWA regulations, and without following the IIJA’s \nrequirements . . . [; and] \n3   \n(c)   Effectuating a categorical suspension or termination of the \n4  NEVI Formula Program for Plaintiff States through any \nother means. \n5   \n \n6  Dkt. No. 5-2 (proposed order) at 2. Because the Court finds that, in effectively suspending the \n7  NEVI Formula Program, Defendants have overstepped their Constitutional and statutory \n8  authority and have attempted to override the express will of Congress, and for further reasons \n9  explained herein, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion. \n10    As will be explained below, the Court’s decision is guided by the United States \n11  Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), Pub. L. 79–404, 60 Stat. 237 \n12  (1946). “Separation of powers and checks and balances are fundamental to the structure of the \n13  government established by our Constitution. ‘To preserve those checks [on each Branch], and \n14  maintain the separation of powers, the carefully defined limits on the power of each Branch must \n15  not be eroded.’” Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Trump, No. 25-3293, 2025 WL 1541714, at *7 \n16  (9th Cir. May 30, 2025) (quoting I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 957–58 (1983)). Specifically, \n17  the Constitution “exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.” City \n18  & County of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018) (first citing U.S. \n19  Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause), then citing U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending \n20  Clause)). Under the APA, “[a]dministrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly \n21  possess only the authority that Congress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of \n22  Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). \n23  Although range anxiety, EV charging stations, and current DOT leadership’s policy \n24  preferences lurk in the background of this case, the bedrock doctrines of separation of powers \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 4 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 5 of 66\n \n1  and agency accountability, as enshrined in Constitution and statute, are indifferent to subject \n2  matter and blind to personality. When the Executive Branch treads upon the will of the \n3  Legislative Branch, and when an administrative agency acts contrary to law, it is the Court’s \n4  responsibility to remediate the situation and restore the balance of power. Such remediation and \n5  restoration are what the Court undertakes herein. \n6  II.  BACKGROUND \n7  A.  Parties1 \n8  Plaintiffs are 16 sovereign states of the United States of America, as well as the District \n9  of Columbia. Dkt. No. 1 ¶¶ 14, 20. Plaintiff States include: Washington, Colorado, California, \n10  Arizona, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New \n11  York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Id. ¶¶ 15–31. Plaintiffs “bring this action \n12  in their sovereign and proprietary capacities.” Id. ¶ 14. Defendants are two federal agencies—the \n13  United States Department of Transportation, a cabinet-level agency within the Executive Branch \n14  of the federal government (id. ¶ 32), and the Federal Highway Administration, an agency within \n15  DOT (id. ¶ 34)—and their respective highest ranking officials—Secretary of Transportation Sean \n16  Duffy (id. ¶ 33) and FHWA Executive Director and Acting Administrator Gloria M. Shepherd \n17  (id. ¶ 35). Plaintiffs sue Defendants Duffy and Shepherd in their respective official capacities. Id. \n18  ¶¶ 33, 35. \n19 \n20 \n21   \n1 For clarity and simplicity, the Court will use a state’s name to refer to the relevant agencies in that state. For \n22  example, California’s electric vehicle program is administered by two state agencies, the California Energy \nCommission (“CEC”) and California Department of Transportation (“Caltrans”); this Order refers to the State of \nCalifornia, CEC, and Caltrans as “California.” New York’s program includes the New York State Department of \n23 \nTransportation (“NYSDOT”), the Power Authority of New York (“NYPA”), and New York State Energy Research \nand Development Authority (“NYSERDA”); this Order refers to all of these entities, as well as the state itself, as \n24  “New York.”  \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 5 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 6 of 66\n \n1  B.  Legal Framework: Statute, Executive Order, and Agency Action \n2  1.  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \n3  a.  National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program \n4  In 2021, Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Infrastructure \n5  Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), Pub. L. 117–58, 135 Stat. 429. Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 36. In the law, \n6  Congress established the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (“NEVI”) Formula Program, \n7  which appropriated $5 billion to “‘provide funding to States to strategically deploy electric \n8  vehicle charging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected network to facilitate data \n9  collection, access, and reliability.’” Id. ¶¶ 37, 39 (quoting 135 Stat. at 1421). Congress \n10  established three prescribed uses for the NEVI funds:  \n11  (1) the acquisition and installation of electric vehicle charging \ninfrastructure to serve as a catalyst for the deployment of such \n12  infrastructure and to connect it to a network to facilitate data \ncollection, access, and reliability; (2) proper operation and \n13  maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and \n(3) data sharing about electric vehicle charging infrastructure to \n14  ensure the long-term success of investments made under [the \nNEVI Formula Program provisions of the IIJA].  \n15   \n \n16  Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 40 (alteration in original) (quoting 135 Stat. at 1421–22).2 Per the statute, the funds \n17  must “remain available until expended.” Id. ¶ 37 (quoting 135 Stat. at 1421). \n18  Importantly, the appropriated NEVI funds are “formula” funds, which means that they \n19  were “appropriated by Congress for a specific purpose and must be distributed on the basis of a \n20  statutory formula.” Id. ¶ 38 (citing City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir. \n21  2019)). That is, NEVI funds cannot be used for any purpose other than those that Congress \n22  established in the NEVI Formula Program, and the apportionment of the funds among the \n23 \n \n2 Part of the appropriated funding is reserved to pay for the administration of the program itself and to fund “an \n24  additional grant program.” See Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 47; Dkt. No. 1-6 (FHWA Apportionment Notice) at 2–3.  \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 6 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 7 of 66\n \n1  recipient states cannot deviate from the prescribed statutory formula. Id. ¶ 42. Under the IIJA, \n2  the formula used to distribute NEVI funds is “the same federal formula as that which is used to \n3  distribute highway funds.” Id. (citing 135 Stat. at 1422); see 23 U.S.C. § 104 (formula for \n4  apportionment of federal-aid highway funds). \n5  Under the IIJA, distribution of NEVI Formula funds is the responsibility of the Secretary \n6  of Transportation, as delegated to FHWA: The Secretary “‘shall distribute among the States the \n7  [NEVI Formula Program funds] so that each State receives’ the amount determined by the \n8  formula.” Id. ¶ 42 (quoting 135 Stat. at 1422) (alteration in original) (emphasis omitted). The \n9  IIJA includes two planning prerequisites that must be fulfilled before the appropriated money \n10  can flow from the federal government to the recipient states. First, the IIJA obligated DOT to \n11  develop “‘guidance for States and localities to strategically deploy electric vehicle charging \n12  infrastructure’ consistent with the NEVI Formula Program provisions of the IIJA.” Id. ¶ 44 \n13  (quoting 135 Stat. at 1423). On February 10, 2022, FHWA duly issued its NEVI Formula \n14  Program Guidance. Id. ¶ 45; see Dkt. No. 93-1 (2022 NEVI Formula Program Guidance) at 9–\n15  39. FHWA has updated the guidance annually, most recently on June 11, 2024. Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 45. \n16  Second, to become eligible to receive NEVI funds each year, the IIJA requires each recipient \n17  state to submit to DOT a State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan that “describes \n18  how it ‘intends to use funds distributed to the State . . . to carry out the [NEVI Formula] Program \n19  for each fiscal year in which funds are made available.’” Id. ¶ 43 (quoting 135 Stat. at 1422). \n20  b.  Distributing NEVI Funds \n21  There is a “well-defined” process for distributing NEVI funds. Id. ¶ 46. The first step is \n22  Congressional appropriation. Id. An appropriation is, in essence, a command from Congress to \n23  the Treasury to get out its checkbook; it authorizes the federal government “to incur financial \n24  obligations that will result in immediate or future disbursements of funds from the U.S. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 7 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 8 of 66\n \n1  Treasury.” Id. (citing 2 U.S.C. § 622(2)(A)(i)). In the IIJA, Congress appropriated $5 billion to \n2  FHWA “to carry out the NEVI Formula Program in accordance with specific directives and \n3  subject to express constraints.” Id.  \n4  The next step is apportionment. Id. ¶ 47. This is the determination of who gets how much \n5  of the appropriated funds, and when. The United States Office of Management and Budget \n6  (“OMB”) “apportioned the funds appropriated by Congress by dividing the $5 billion \n7  appropriation across five fiscal years and distributed the funds to the FHWA.” Id. Next, FHWA \n8  further apportions the money by first setting aside administrative and other earmarked funds, see \n9  supra note 2, then “divid[ing] the remaining funds for that fiscal year among the States according \n10  to the non-discretionary statutory formula.” Id. ¶ 47. The NEVI formula is derived from the \n11  statutory formula that FHWA uses to apportion federal highway aid. Id. ¶ 48; see 23 U.S.C. \n12  §§ 104(c), 165. Put another way, the size of a state’s slice of the $5 billion NEVI pie is directly \n13  proportional to the size of its slice of the federal highway aid pie. A given state’s federal \n14  highway aid apportionment is “fixed in statute based on historical apportionments and \n15  congressionally determined shares.” Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 48; see 23 U.S.C. § 104(b)–(c). Just as DOT \n16  cannot meddle with the Congressionally determined federal highway aid apportionments, \n17  “[n]either the Secretary nor the FHWA, nor any other part of the Executive Branch has discretion \n18  to determine the amount of funding apportioned to any State under the NEVI Formula Program.” \n19  Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 48; 23 U.S.C. § 104. \n20  After the funds are apportioned, they are made available for obligation. In the NEVI \n21  Formula Program, FHWA made “available for obligation” each state’s apportioned funds each \n22  fiscal year and advised the states by way of a letter. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1-7 (Shepherd Letter) at 1 \n23  (advising Washington that “Fiscal Year 2022 funds [were] now available . . . for obligation”). \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 8 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 9 of 66\n \n1  When funds became available for obligation, FHWA sent each state the same letter. See Dkt. No. \n2  109 (Hr’g Tr.) at 9:10–12. \n3  The next step is obligation. Dkt. No. 1 ¶¶ 49–52. An obligation is a legal duty that makes \n4  the federal government liable for payment for “goods and services ordered or received,” or a \n5  legal duty that could mature into such a liability. See id. ¶ 50 (citing U.S. Gov’t Accountability \n6  Off. Pub. No. GAO-05-734SP (A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process), at 12–\n7  13 (Sept. 2005) (“GAO Glossary”)). It is “a ‘definite commitment’ from the government to pay \n8  for something. Id. (citing GAO Glossary); see also Dkt. 93-1 (Biondi Decl.) ¶ 10 \n9  (acknowledging that an obligation creates a “contractual[] commit[ment]” between FHWA and \n10  states). “States obligate their share of apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds by submitting \n11  to the FHWA an authorization request for specific activities.” Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 51. If the activities for \n12  which a state requests authorization “meet the minimum standards and requirements” given in 23 \n13  C.F.R. § 680 (“National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Standards and Requirements”), FHWA \n14  must approve the request. Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 51; 23 C.F.R. § 680. Upon FHWA’s authorization of a \n15  request, the funds are obligated, and the promise is made. Id. \n16  The fourth step is disbursement. Disbursement, simply put, is the actual transfer of funds \n17  from the Treasury to the states. \n18  c.  Withdrawing or Withholding NEVI Funds \n19  Under the IIJA, DOT has little discretion to withhold or withdraw NEVI funds from the \n20  states. Id. ¶ 53. The Department “must distribute to each State its share of NEVI Formula \n21  Program funds unless [(1)] the state fails to timely submit its State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n22  Deployment Plan or [(2)] the Secretary ‘determines a State has not taken action to carry out its \n23  State Plan.’” Id. (cleaned up) (quoting 135 Stat. at 1422). The option to withhold or withdraw \n24  funds on the latter basis is unavailable unless DOT complies with substantial procedural \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 9 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 10 of 66\n \n1  requirements. Before DOT determines that a State has not taken sufficient action on its plan, it \n2  must first “notify the State, consult with the State, and identify actions that can be taken to \n3  rectify concerns, and provide at least 90 days for the State to rectify concerns and take action to \n4  carry out its State Plan.” Id. ¶ 54 (cleaned up) (quoting 135 Stat. at 1422). And even if such a \n5  determination is made, DOT cannot do anything about it—that is, it cannot withhold or withdraw \n6  NEVI Formula funding—without first complying with further procedural requirements: “The \n7  Secretary shall provide notice to a State on the intent to withhold or withdraw funds not less than \n8  60 days before withholding or withdrawing any funds, during which time the State shall have an \n9  opportunity to appeal a decision to withhold or withdraw funds directly to the Secretary.” Id. \n10  (cleaned up) (quoting 135 Stat. at 1422). \n11  Further, even if DOT successfully clears these procedural requirements, the IIJA redirects \n12  the withheld or withdrawn funds only to certain alternate recipients. Funds withheld or \n13  withdrawn from a state may be awarded “on a competitive basis to local jurisdictions within the \n14  State for use on projects that meet the eligibility requirements.” Id. ¶ 55 (quoting 135 Stat. at \n15  1422). If the funds are not awarded to local jurisdictions within the state from which they were \n16  originally withheld or withdrawn, the IIJA requires that they be distributed among other states \n17  “in the same manner as funds distributed for that fiscal year”—that is, by the NEVI \n18  apportionment formula described above. Id. (quoting 135 Stat. at 1422–23). In short, the statute \n19  requires that NEVI Formula funds will be spent by someone, somewhere, on EV infrastructure. \n20  2.  “Unleashing American Energy” Executive Order and DOT Order 2100.7 \n21  On January 20, 2025, the first day of his presidency, President Trump issued Executive \n22  Order No. 14,154, entitled “Unleashing American Energy.” 90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025). \n23  Section 7(a) of the Order directed “[a]ll agencies [to] immediately pause the disbursement of \n24  funds appropriated through . . . the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 10 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 11 of 66\n \n1  including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through \n2  the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” Id. at 8357. The Order \n3  further directed all agencies to “review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, \n4  loans, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the \n5  law and [the President’s energy policy priorities].” Id. \n6  On January 29, 2025, his first full day as Secretary of Transportation, see 171 Cong. Rec. \n7  S408 (daily ed. Jan. 28, 2025) (vote on Duffy nomination), Defendant Duffy issued DOT Order \n8  No. 2100.7, “Ensuring Reliance Upon Sound Economic Analysis in Department of \n9  Transportation Policies, Programs, and Activities,” Dkt. No. 1-10 (DOT Order No. 2100.7 (Jan. \n10  29, 2025)). This Order purports to “reset[] the principles and standards underpinning U.S. \n11  Department of Transportation . . . policies, programs, and activities to mandate reliance on \n12  rigorous economic analysis and positive cost-benefit calculations and ensure that all DOT grants, \n13  loans, contracts, and DOT-supported or -assisted State contracts bolster the American economy \n14  and benefit the American people.” Id. at 2. The Department’s new priorities purport to base \n15  “grantmaking, lending, policymaking, and rulemaking activities” on “sound economic principles \n16  and analysis supported by rigorous cost-benefit requirements and date-driven decisions.” At the \n17  same time, however, they include the prioritization of “projects and goals” that, among other \n18  things, “give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national \n19  average; prohibit recipients of DOT support or assistance from imposing vaccine and mask \n20  mandates; and require local compliance or cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement.” \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 11 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 12 of 66\n \n1  Id. at 2, 4 (cleaned up). Order No. 2100.7 became effective immediately, upon its execution by \n2  the new Secretary. Id. at 2.3 \n3  3.  Biondi Letter \n4  On February 6, 2025, one week after the DOT’s installation of Defendant Duffy and his \n5  issuance of Order No. 2100.7, Emily Biondi, Associate Administrator in FHWA’s Office of \n6  Planning, Environment, and Realty, addressed a letter to “State Department of Transportation \n7  Directors” (Dkt. No. 1-9 (“Biondi Letter”)). The Biondi Letter stated that “[t]he new leadership \n8  of the Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) has decided to review the policies underlying \n9  the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program.” Id. at 2. The Biondi Letter rescinded “the \n10  current NEVI Formula Program Guidance dated June 11, 2024, and all prior versions of this \n11  guidance,” and “immediately suspend[ed] the approval of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n12  Deployment plans for all fiscal years.” Id. at 2–3. The Biondi Letter mandated that, “effective \n13  immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated \n14  final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new State plans are submitted and \n15  approved.” Id. at 3. The Biondi Letter did not provide a date when updated NEVI Formula \n16  Program guidance would be issued but stated that “FHWA aims to have updated draft NEVI \n17  Formula Guidance published for public comment in the spring.” Id. As of the date of this order, \n18  no new guidance has been issued, nor has any draft been published for public comment. With no \n19  guidance in effect, states cannot submit the deployment plans that the IIJA requires for them to \n20  be eligible to receive NEVI Formula funds. In revoking all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n21  Deployment Plans, Defendants are, according to Plaintiffs, “withholding approximately $2.74 \n22 \n \n3 The Court notes, as a district court recently found, that “Congress did not authorize or grant authority to the \n23 \nSecretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars specifically \nappropriated for transportation purposes.” California v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., No. C25-208, 2025 WL 1711531, at \n24  *2 (D.R.I.

No. 1 ¶ 115. Plaintiffs allege that they have \n3  been “deprived of access to approximately $1 billion in available NEVI Formula Program funds \n4  for those four fiscal years.” Id. \n5  C.  Factual Background \n6  After President Biden signed the IIJA into law on November 15, 2021, FHWA had 90 \n7  days to issue the first version of NEVI Formula Program guidance. See 135 Stat. at 1423. FHWA \n8  complied with the law and issued guidance on February 10, 2022. See Dkt. No. 93-1 at 9–39. \n9  Plaintiff States then began preparing State Electric Infrastructure Deployment Plans. See, e.g., \n10  Dkt. No. 7-1 (California Plan) at 2–65; Dkt. No. 17-1 (New Jersey Plan) at 2–76; Dkt. No. 28-1 \n11  (Washington Plan) at 2–59. The State Electric Infrastructure Deployment Plans are detailed and \n12  dense planning documents that are not easily summarized. In short, however, the plans detail the \n13  who, what, when, where, why, and how of new, statewide electric vehicle infrastructure for each \n14  Plaintiff State. They include, among other things, timelines, discussions concerning public \n15  engagement, and analyses of commercial and technological trends in EV infrastructure. Plans \n16  detail demographic, ecological, geographical, and economic realities within a state, and the \n17  “alternative fuel corridors” that have been designated to address them. They identify funding \n18  sources, both state and federal, as well as the processes for resolving conflicts and hashing out \n19  ambiguities. Plans report the results of public-interest surveys in which state residents have \n20  voiced their opinions about desired amenities at EV charging stations, and they explain how \n21  contracts for construction will be awarded.  \n22  Plaintiff States submitted their respective plans in 2022, as well as annual updates in \n23  2023 and 2024, to FHWA for approval, and the agency approved them for fiscal years 2022, \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 13 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 14 of 66\n \n1  2023, 2024, and 2025.4 Dkt.

No. 1-8 (NEVI Formula Program Status of Funds) at 2.5 Upon \n10  FHWA’s approval (and re-approval) of a state’s EV deployment plan, NEVI Formula funds \n11  became available to that state for obligation. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1-7 (Washington approval letter) \n12  at 2; Dkt. No. 1-8 at 2. With FHWA-approved deployment plans in hand, states could submit \n13  requests to FHWA for approval of individual projects. Upon approval of a project, FHWA would \n14  obligate NEVI Formula funds to the state for that project. Requests for approval were handled by \n15  FHWA’s regional divisions. See Dkt. No. 7 ¶ 11. In California, for example,  \n16  FHWA’s California division instructed [the state] to use a project-\nby-project, and project-phase by project-phase, approach to seek \n17  funding obligations. Under this approach, in order for funding to \nbecome obligated, a State must submit an authorization request to \n18  FHWA via the online federal portal for each particular phase (e.g., \npreliminary engineering, right-of-way, construction) of each \n19   \n4 Unlike other Plaintiff States, Plaintiffs District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont did not submit declarations \n20  that attested to FHWA’s approval and re-approval of their state deployment plans. Under Local Civil Rule 7(b)(1), \nbecause Plaintiffs’ “motion requires consideration of facts not appearing of record,” Plaintiffs should have “also \nserve[d] and file[d] copies of all affidavits, declarations, photographic or other evidence presented in support of the \n21 \nmotion.” \n22  5 Docket No. 1-8, “NEVI Formula Program Status of Funds,” is a table that lists, among other data from FHWA’s \nFiscal Management Information System, the total amount of NEVI Formula funds made available to each state as of \nFebruary 6, 2025. Dkt. No. 1-8 at 2. The fact that all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have \n23 \nhad funds made available to them indicates that FHWA approved every state’s NEVI deployment plan. See IIJA, \n135 Stat. at 1422 (conditioning availability of NEVI Formula funds on FHWA’s approval of a state deployment \n24  plan). \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 14 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 15 of 66\n \n1  particular NEVI-funded project carried out by the responsible \nNEVI awardee. \n2   \n \n3  Id.; see also Dkt. No. 10 (Kelly Decl.) ¶ 13 (“The timing of fund obligation . . . varies by state \n4  based on the guidance of the local FHWA Division Office.”). Where non-Plaintiff-state \n5  Massachusetts has been able to obligate its entire apportionment of 2022–25 NEVI Formula \n6  funds (see Dkt. No. 1-8 at 2), such an approach would have been impossible in Colorado, where \n7  “[t]he FHWA Colorado Division Office discourages early obligation of funds or the full \n8  obligation of an entire program beyond what is expected to be spent and reimbursed within the \n9  next 12-month period in order to avoid inactivity on a given project” (Dkt. No. 10 ¶ 13).  \n10  On February 6, 2025, FHWA issued the Biondi Letter, rescinding FHWA’s NEVI \n11  Formula Program guidance and revoking all state deployment plans that had been approved \n12  pursuant to that guidance. Dkt. 1-9. States were no longer able to submit requests and receive \n13  approvals to draw down NEVI Formula funds that had been authorized and apportioned. In \n14  California, for example, on March 28, 2025, a state employee attempted to submit the state’s \n15  “first authorization request for construction incurred for a NEVI-funded project in California.” \n16  Dkt. No. 8 (Lam Decl.) ¶ 10. But the request—for $310,302 owed on construction of a Tesla \n17  charging station in San Diego that was already underway—was met with an error message: \n18  “Request cannot be processed. One or more Program Code balances has been exceeded.” Id.; see \n19  also Dkt. No. 8-1 at 3; Dkt. No. 100 (O’Dea Decl.) ¶ 7. “All of California’s NEVI Formula \n20  Program apportioned funds were listed as ‘expired,’ and [California] was unable to obligate \n21  additional dollars for NEVI projects.” Dkt. No. 8 ¶ 10. Three days later, on March 31, 2025, the \n22  Director of Financial Services for FHWA’s California Division advised the state that, pursuant to \n23  the Biondi Letter, “the NEVI formula program codes have been placed in ‘expired’ status. Thus, \n24  no funds are available for obligation.” Id.; see Dkt. No. 8-1 at 2. As another example, Delaware \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 15 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 16 of 66\n \n1  is short “$49,875 of deferred advance construction funding for an FHWA approved NEVI \n2  project.” Dkt. No. 12 ¶ 18. Delaware now needs to divert that money “from another FHWA, non-\n3  NEVI program or [from] state funding” to cover the shortfall, because “FHWA has removed all \n4  access to the FY25 NEVI apportionment as well as the planned FY26 NEVI apportionment.” Id. \n5  ¶ 19. \n6  On May 7, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a civil action and the instant motion for a preliminary \n7  injunction. Dkt. Nos. 1, 5.  \n8  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n9  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a) authorizes district courts to issue preliminary \n10  injunctions. Preliminary injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy that is “never awarded as of \n11  right.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  \n12  To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish that \n(1) it is likely to prevail on the merits of its substantive claims, \n13  (2) it is likely to suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent an \ninjunction, (3) the balance of equities favors an injunction, and \n14  (4) an injunction is in the public interest.”  \n \n15  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Petrick, 68 F.4th 475, 490 (9th Cir. 2023) (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at \n16  20, 22–23). Ninth Circuit courts evaluate these factors on a “sliding scale”—that is, “serious \n17  questions going to the merits and a balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff \n18  can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a \n19  likelihood of irreparable injury and the injunction is in the public interest.” Arc of Cal. v. \n20  Douglas, 757 F.3d 975, 983 (9th Cir. 2014). “Where the government is a party to a case in which \n21  a preliminary injunction is sought, the balance of the equities and public interest factors merge.” \n22  Roman v. Wolf, 977 F.3d 935, 940–41 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, \n23  747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014)).  \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 16 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 17 of 66\n \n1  IV.  DISCUSSION \n2  This case is one of several where plaintiffs have sought to enjoin the Executive Branch of \n3  the federal government from implementing a “categorical freeze” on congressionally \n4  appropriated funds. See, e.g., Maryland v. Corp. for Nat’l & Cmty. Serv. (AmeriCorps), No. C25-\n5  1363, 2025 WL 1585051 (June 6, 2025); New York v. Trump, No. C25-39, 2025 WL 715621 \n6  (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025); Washington v. Trump, 768 F. Supp. 3d 1239 (W.D. Wash. 2025). \n7  Plaintiffs here, like the plaintiffs in these other cases, bring statutory claims under the \n8  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), constitutional claims, and an ultra vires claim. \n9  Defendants raise two threshold issues that must be addressed before reaching the merits \n10  of Plaintiffs’ motion: (1) whether Plaintiffs’ claims are ripe (Dkt. No. 93 at 12–15) and \n11  (2) whether Defendants have taken final agency action (id. at 15–17).  \n12  A.  Threshold Issues \n13  1.  Ripeness \n14  Article III requires that Plaintiffs’ claim(s) be ripe for adjudication. See Susan B. Anthony \n15  List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 157 n.5 (2014). Ripeness is a “jurisdictional prerequisite” in the \n16  Ninth Circuit. Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 2000). \n17  “The ripeness doctrine, which aims to avoid premature and potentially unnecessary adjudication, \n18  ‘is drawn from both Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for \n19  refusing to exercise jurisdiction.’” Ass’n of Irritated Residents v. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency, 10 \n20  F.4th 937, 944 (9th Cir. 2021) (quoting Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of the Interior, 538 U.S. \n21  803, 808 (2003)). There are thus two components of ripeness: constitutional and prudential.  \n22  a.  Constitutional Ripeness \n23  “‘The constitutional component of ripeness overlaps with the “injury in fact” analysis for \n24  Article III standing,’ and therefore ‘the inquiry is largely the same: whether the issues presented \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 17 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 18 of 66\n \n1  are ‘definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.’” Id. (quoting Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 \n2  F.3d 1045, 1058 (9th Cir. 2010)); see Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1139 (“[I]n ‘measuring whether the \n3  litigant has asserted an injury that is real and concrete rather than speculative and hypothetical, \n4  the ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with standing.’” (quoting Gene R. Nichol, Jr., \n5  Ripeness and the Constitution, 54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 153, 172 (1987))). \n6  Here, Defendants argue that, as alleged, Plaintiffs’ injuries are merely hypothetical and \n7  speculative: “Plaintiffs’ alleged potential future injuries stemming from the possibility that \n8  FHWA’s future guidance will negatively impact their projects cannot form the basis for the \n9  Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction.” Dkt. No. 93 at 13. “Injury can only accrue,” Defendants \n10  assert, “after the obligation phase because it is only at that point that a State is entitled to receive \n11  reimbursement for its expenditure of NEVI funds—before then, all actions are contingent upon \n12  FHWA approvals.” Id. For their part, Plaintiffs assert that the Court “should ‘consider the \n13  practical effects’” of what Defendants have done. Dkt. No. 99 at 7 (quoting Washington v. \n14  DeVos, 466 F. Supp. 3d 1151, 1162 (E.D. Wash. 2020)). “Plaintiffs cannot move forward with \n15  previously approved State Plans because . . . Defendants . . . have revoked those Plans and refuse \n16  to obligate any additional funds under them.” Id. This, Plaintiffs argue, is an “immediate, \n17  concrete, and irreparable” injury. Id.  \n18  Here, constitutional ripeness is satisfied because Plaintiffs adequately allege injury in \n19  fact. “A ‘loss of funds promised under federal law satisfies Article III’s standing requirement,’” \n20  especially where a plaintiff “rel[ies] heavily on federal funding.” City & County of San \n21  Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1235 (quoting Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d \n22  956, 965 (9th Cir. 2015)). Ninth Circuit courts have routinely found that a plaintiff’s allegation \n23  that it “ha[s] lost or will likely lose federal funding” is a cognizable injury-in-fact. See San \n24  Francisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, No. C25-1824, 2025 WL 1621636, at *9 (N.D. Cal. June 9, \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 18 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 19 of 66\n \n1  2025); Washington v. Trump, 766 F. Supp. 3d 1138, 1149 (W.D. Wash. 2025) (“The fact that the \n2  loss of funds may have not yet materialized . . . does not mean that there is no imminent injury or \n3  that Plaintiffs lack standing on this ground.”); see also E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 \n4  F.3d 742, 766–67 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding that plaintiffs demonstrated standing by “showing that \n5  [agency action] will cause them to lose a substantial amount of funding”). Even an alleged loss \n6  of “potential future recoupment of federal funds” represents sufficient injury-in-fact to confer \n7  standing, Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841, 849 (9th Cir. 2022), as does a “diver[sion] of scarce \n8  resources” from one part of a “limited budget” to another, Serv. Women’s Action Network v. \n9  Mattis, 352 F. Supp. 3d 977, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  \n10  Further, “economic injury is generally a legally protected interest.” Cent. Ariz. Water \n11  Conservation Dist. v. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency, 990 F.2d 1531, 1537 (9th Cir. 1993). Where a \n12  plaintiff has “established business relationships and contracts with others based on [defendant’s] \n13  program,” and “these business deals have not and cannot be realized because of [agency action, \n14  t]his loss of business is ‘concrete, particularized, and actual . . . ’ given its dollar value.” Stenson \n15  Tamaddon, LLC v. U.S. Internal Rev. Serv., 742 F. Supp. 3d 966, 982 (D. Ariz. 2024) (quoting \n16  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  \n17  Here, Defendants’ actions have deprived Plaintiffs of expected and relied-upon funding. \n18  Moreover, Defendants’ refusal to obligate IIJA’s congressionally appropriated funds has \n19  disrupted business expectancies that the respective Plaintiff States have made pursuant to their \n20  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans. To various degrees, Plaintiffs describe \n21  scenarios where Defendants’ freeze of expected funding has pulled the rug out from under them, \n22  leaving them with partially completed, partially funded infrastructure projects. \n23  Arizona submitted deployment plans in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which FHWA approved. \n24  Dkt. No. 11 ¶¶ 9–10. In approving Arizona’s plans, FHWA “ma[de] funds available for \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 19 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 20 of 66\n \n1  obligation for fiscal years 2022 through 2025.” Id. ¶ 10. FHWA advised Arizona that, “[w]ith \n2  this approval . . . funds are now available to Arizona for obligation.” Id. These funds totaled \n3  $11.3 million for fiscal year 2022 and $16.3 million each year for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and \n4  2025. Id. ¶ 11. Based on FHWA’s assertion that such funds were available for obligation, \n5  Arizona “relied and acted upon the FHWA’s statutory obligation to provide NEVI formula \n6  funding consistent with the IIJA’s requirements.” Id. ¶ 19. Prior to the issuance of the Biondi \n7  Letter, FHWA had obligated to Arizona $12,090,426 in NEVI Formula funding. See id. ¶ 12. But \n8  the Biondi Letter “made clear that Arizona would not have access to the approximately $48.1 \n9  million of unobligated funds which had been made available to Arizona through its State Plan \n10  Approvals.” Id. ¶ 18. Following Defendants’ suspension of Arizona’s State Plan, Arizona \n11  canceled a “solicitation for 35 prospective EV charging station locations identified in State \n12  Plans.” Id. Arizona “spent a significant amount of funds and staff time preparing this solicitation, \n13  which had to be canceled after the State Plans were suspended.” Id. ¶ 19.  \n14  California submitted deployment plans in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which FHWA \n15  approved. Dkt. No. 7 ¶¶ 7–9. FHWA’s approval of California’s plans made a total of \n16  $301,952,392 in NEVI Formula funds available to California for obligation for fiscal years 2022 \n17  through 2025. Id. ¶ 9 Congress’s appropriation of NEVI funds, combined with FHWA’s \n18  subsequent approval of California’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan, led \n19  California to enter into business arrangements with contractors who would “construct the electric \n20  vehicle charging infrastructure . . . .” Id. ¶ 10. Between October 2023 and September 2024, \n21  California awarded projects worth $36.6 million through a solicitation process. Id. But “[d]ue to \n22  the uncertainty about the availability of federal funding, one [contractor] asked to withdraw one \n23  of its two charging station sites from the NEVI program so that it [could] continue with other \n24  funding after its construction authorization request was denied.” Id. ¶ 19. “The longer \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 20 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 21 of 66\n \n1  [California] is prevented from making new obligations of apportioned funds, the more certain it \n2  is that awarded projects will lose critical financing, permits and rights-of-way, subcontractors, \n3  and/or other project partners, and not be able to proceed.” Id. ¶ 21. California has identified 21 \n4  project sites that “are otherwise ready to move forward with development of the charging \n5  stations,” but cannot because “site hosts . . . are holding off from signing agreements with \n6  awardees until federal funding is available for obligation.” Dkt. No. 100 ¶ 6. \n7  Colorado submitted deployment plans in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which FHWA approved. \n8  Dkt. No. 9 ¶¶ 8–9. FHWA’s approval of Colorado’s plans made NEVI Formula funds “available \n9  to Colorado for obligation” for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Dkt. No. 10-1 (FHWA \n10  approval letters) at 2, 5, 8. These funds totaled $8,368,277 for fiscal year 2022, $12,042,045 for \n11  fiscal year 2023, $12,042,129 for fiscal year 2024, and $12,042,139 for fiscal year 2025—in the \n12  aggregate, $44,494,590. See Dkt. No. 10 (Kelly Decl.) ¶ 10. Colorado “relied on the FHWA’s \n13  approval of its first three State Plans and the formulaic allocation of the NEVI program to begin \n14  awarding grants and contracting with grantees.” Dkt. No. 9 ¶ 10. Colorado “has contracted with \n15  grantees for approximately $18 million in work to implement Colorado’s State Plan.” Id. ¶ 11. \n16  But “only $8 million has been obligated . . . , meaning that only $8 million has been requested \n17  and approved . . . . This leaves a gap of $10 million that has been contracted to grantees but not \n18  obligated by FHWA.” Id. As a consequence, although there are projects in Colorado “that are \n19  currently in the design phase or actively under construction,” Colorado “will not have access to \n20  sufficient FHWA obligations to allow all of these projects to proceed to completion.” Dkt. \n21  No. 10 ¶ 21. Given Defendants’ funding freeze, “Colorado will have insufficient funds to \n22  reimburse expenses for more than half of the currently executed contracts between [Colorado] \n23  and grantees.” Id.  \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 21 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 22 of 66\n \n1  Delaware submitted deployment plans in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which FHWA approved. \n2  Dkt. No. 12 ¶¶ 9–10. FHWA’s approval of Delaware’s plans made NEVI Formula funds \n3  “available to Delaware for obligation” for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025—$2,617,339 \n4  for fiscal year 2022, $3,766,380 for fiscal year 2023, $3,766,406 for fiscal year 2024, and \n5  $3,766,409 for fiscal year 2025. Id. ¶¶ 10–11. But the Biondi Letter “made clear that Delaware \n6  would not have access to the $7,532,826 of FY25 NEVI program allocation previously provided \n7  and the anticipated FY26 NEVI program allocation to be provided” in the future. Id. ¶ 18. \n8  Delaware “has obligated $10,150,125 for NEVI Program eligible expenses” and has begun \n9  construction on two projects. Id. ¶ 12. Delaware “relied and acted upon the FHWA’s statutory \n10  obligation to provide NEVI formula funding consistent with the IIJA’s requirements.” Id. ¶ 19. \n11  Delaware’s “NEVI Program roll out requirements . . . are all reliant on the receipt and ability to \n12  utilize the NEVI funding authorized.” Id. Further, the state has “finalized two NEVI contracts for \n13  three sites across the state. . . . Several other contracts are in the final stages of wrapping up the \n14  contract language.” Id. ¶ 12. But Delaware is short $49,875 for deferred advance construction \n15  funding for an FHWA approved NEVI project,” and Defendants’ actions have rendered NEVI \n16  funds unavailable. Id. ¶ 18. Consequently, Delaware will need to locate and re-budget “$49,875 \n17  of funding from another FHWA, non-NEVI program or state funding” to cover the shortfall. Id. \n18  ¶ 19. \n19  The District of Columbia submitted deployment plans “representing fiscal years 2022 \n20  through 2025,” which FHWA approved. Dkt. No. 1 ¶¶ 69–70. FHWA’s approval of the District’s \n21  plans made approximately $13 million in NEVI Formula Program funds “available to the District \n22  of Columbia for obligation” for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025. Id. ¶¶ 70, 145; Dkt. \n23  No. 1-8 at 2. The District “acted in reliance on the FHWA complying with the IIJA to obligate \n24  and disburse the District’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds to build a robust, reliable, and \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 22 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 23 of 66\n \n1  interconnected charging network across all eight District Wards to promote EV adoption.” Dkt. \n2  No. 1 ¶ 146.  \n3  Hawai‘i “prepared and provided to FHWA its State Plans for fiscal years 2022–2025,” \n4  which FHWA approved.

Hawai‘i “relied and acted upon the FHWA’s statutory obligation to \n7  provide NEVI formula funding consistent with the IIJA’s requirements.” Id. ¶ 19. In reliance on \n8  NEVI funds, Hawai‘i “proceeded with purchasing chargers for eight of its NEVI sites . . . and \n9  finalizing design for seven additional sites with the assumption the funds would be available for \n10  construction, operations, and maintenance. But the Biondi Letter “made clear that Hawai‘i would \n11  not have access to the remainder of funds not previously obligated of $2,068,482.48 which had \n12  been made available to it through its State Plan Approvals.” Id. ¶ 18. “Without the NEVI \n13  Formula Funds, [Hawai‘i] will need to utilize local funds intended for other projects to complete \n14  the remaining NEVI sites or stop all activities that cannot be funded.” Id. ¶ 19. \n15  Illinois submitted state deployment plans to FHWA in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which \n16  FHWA respectively approved. Dkt. No. 15 ¶¶ 9–10. FHWA’s approval of Illinois’s plans made \n17  approximately $117 million in NEVI Formula funds “available to Illinois for obligation” for \n18  fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025. Id. ¶¶ 10–11. Illinois has “awarded $25.4 million to \n19  grantees for approved projects and has contractual obligations with grantees totaling $25.4 \n20  million.” Id. ¶ 12. But the Biondi Letter “made clear that [FHWA] is withholding access to the \n21  $117 million which had been made available to Illinois through the FHWA’s State Plan \n22  Approvals.” Id. ¶ 18. Illinois “relied and acted upon the FHWA’s statutory obligation to provide \n23  [Illinois] with its dedicated share of NEVI Formula Program funding consistent with the IIJA’s \n24  requirements. NEVI Formula Program funding was intended to cover [Illinois’s] contractual \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 23 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 24 of 66\n \n1  obligations.” Id. ¶ 19. Illinois “is in final negotiations with a consultant to assist with \n2  construction oversight of awarded and obligated NEVI Formula Program funded projects, and \n3  [Illinois] will need to obligate additional NEVI Formula Program funds to pay for these \n4  consulting services.” Id. ¶ 12. \n5  Maryland submitted state deployment plans to FHWA in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which \n6  FHWA respectively approved. Dkt. No. 16 ¶¶ 10, 12. FHWA’s approval of Maryland’s plans \n7  made $49,438,402 in NEVI Formula funds “available to Maryland for obligation”—$9,298,080 \n8  for fiscal year 2022, $13,380,042 for fiscal year 2023, $13,380,134 for fiscal year 2024, and \n9  $13,380,146 for fiscal year 2025. Id. ¶ 13. Maryland obligated $14,668,456 of these funds in a \n10  first round of “design-build procurement.” Id. ¶ 14. But the Biondi Letter “made clear that \n11  Maryland would not have access to the unobligated total of $34,769,945 in Fiscal Year[s] 22–25 \n12  funds which had been made available to Maryland through its State Plan Approvals.” Id. ¶ 21. \n13  Maryland has “relied and acted upon the FHWA’s statutory obligation to provide NEVI formula \n14  funding consistent with the IIJA’s requirements” to continue implementing its deployment plans. \n15  Id. ¶ 22. The state advertised “NEVI Round 2 procurement” on December 17, 2024, and \n16  “submitted an authorization request [to FHWA] for $475,000 to support design work for Round \n17  2 projects” but “is unable to continue with its NEVI Round 2 procurement process,” in part due \n18  to “the lack of obligated NEVI funds to administer the procurement process . . . .” Dkt.

Minnesota, \n2  acting “[i]n reliance on the FHWA’s compliance with the IIJA . . . included NEVI Formula \n3  Program funds as a set-aside in its State Transportation Improvement Program . . . .” Id. ¶ 167. \n4  Based on the availability of NEVI Formula funds, Minnesota “is taking steps towards executing \n5  contracts for [NEVI] projects, which will result in a total of 24 fully executed contracts in \n6  summer 2025.”Id. ¶ 169. But although such funds were “made available,” FHWA “has only \n7  obligated funds for 19 of these 24 projects.” Id. ¶ 170. To fulfill conditional awards granted to \n8  contractors prior to Defendants’ rescission of its State Plan, Minnesota has “identified” state \n9  funds in lieu of the expected federal funds. Id. ¶ 171. \n10  New Jersey submitted state deployment plans to FHWA in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which \n11  FHWA approved. Dkt. No. 17 ¶¶ 8–9. FHWA’s approval of New Jersey’s plans made \n12  approximately $82 million in NEVI Formula funds “available to New Jersey for obligation” for \n13  fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025. Id. ¶¶ 9–10. The Biondi Letter “made clear that [New \n14  Jersey] would not have access to approximately $73 million in funds which had been made \n15  available . . . for obligation through its State Plan approvals.” Id. ¶ 18. New Jersey has “relied \n16  and acted upon the FHWA’s statutory obligation to provide NEVI formula funding consistent \n17  with the IIJA’s requirements.” Id. ¶ 19. The state “awarded a publicly advertised contract for the \n18  development, planning, design, installation, five-year operation and maintenance of 76 NEVI-\n19  compliant electric vehicle charging ports at 19 locations throughout New Jersey to the lowest \n20  bidder for $20.96 million.” Id. “[W]ithout NEVI Formula Program funding, [New Jersey] is \n21  unable to execute the contract because there are no alternative funding sources available.” Id.  \n22  New Mexico “prepared and provided to the FHWA its State Plans for fiscal years 2022–\n23  2025,” which FHWA respectively approved for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025.

Id. ¶¶ \n3  9–10. New Mexico had obligated and contracted $11.6 million of its available funds prior to \n4  Defendants’ actions. Id. ¶ 11. But the Biondi Letter “made clear that [New Mexico] would not \n5  have access to the remaining $18.611 million in funds which had been made available to [New \n6  Mexico] through its State Plan approvals.” Id. ¶ 17. New Mexico “relied and acted upon the \n7  FHWA’s statutory obligation to provide NEVI Formula Funding consistent with the IIJA’s \n8  requirements.” Id. ¶ 18. The state “was relying on the federal funding to build out electric vehicle \n9  charging stations to advance the adoption of electric vehicles in order to have a positive impact” \n10  on the state’s greenhouse gas reduction goals. Id. A New Mexico state official avers that \n11  “projects in the middle of contract negotiations have been forced to abruptly halt, with no clear \n12  timeline for when they might resume or whether they will be reimbursed at all.” Id. Further, \n13  “[c]ompanies have hired staff as millions of dollars of investment were anticipated to be made.” \n14  Id. ¶ 19.  \n15  New York “prepared and provided to FHWA its State Plans for fiscal years 2022–2025,” \n16  which FHWA approved. Dkt. No. 20 ¶¶ 13, 15. FHWA’s approval of New York’s State Plans \n17  made $138,092,735 in NEVI Formula funds “available to New York for obligation”—\n18  $25,971,644 for fiscal year 2022, $37,373,438 for fiscal year 2023, $37,373,747 for fiscal year \n19  2024, and $37,373,779 for fiscal year 2025.

New York “relied and acted upon the FHWA’s statutory \n23  obligation to provide NEVI formula funding consistent with the IIJA’s requirements.” Id. ¶ 23. \n24  The state “entered into an agreement for Power Authority of New York to administer a portion of \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 26 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 27 of 66\n \n1  the NEVI Formula Program that had already been approved by FHWA to [New York].” Id. ¶ 6. \n2  New York also entered into an agreement with the New York Energy Research and Development \n3  Authority “to administer a portion of the NEVI Formula Program that had already been approved \n4  by FHWA to [New York].” Id. ¶ 7. This agreement presupposed New York’s receipt of some \n5  $56 million in expected NEVI funds for charging stations and workforce development activities. \n6  Id. New York is now unable to “move forward on over $50,000,000 in [charging station] projects \n7  along New York’s highway corridors.” Id. ¶ 23.  \n8  Oregon “submitted [to FHWA] and received approval of three NEVI State Plans for \n9  fiscal years 2022–2025 . . . .” Dkt.

Oregon “relied and acted upon the \n15  FHWA’s statutory obligation to provide NEVI Program Formula funding consistent with the \n16  IIJA’s requirements.” Id. ¶ 25. The state “planned to use NEVI funding to develop a total of \n17  eleven electric vehicle [alternative fuel corridors].” Id. ¶ 10. “In December 2024, [Oregon] \n18  issued Notices of Intent to Award [grants] to three private entities . . . , and negotiations between \n19  [Oregon] and the grantees regarding the grant terms are ongoing.” Id. But due to the freeze on \n20  NEVI funding, Oregon “either cannot enter into agreements with grantees or it must re-negotiate \n21  with grantees to reduce the overall project costs, limiting the additional benefits Oregon would \n22  otherwise receive.” Id. ¶ 26.  \n23  Rhode Island “prepared and provided to the FHWA its State Plans for fiscal years 2022–\n24  2025,” which FHWA approved.

But the Biondi Letter “made clear that Rhode \n6  Island would not have access to the net outstanding $16,150,711.84 which had been made \n7  available to Rhode Island through its State Plan approvals.” Id. ¶ 24. Rhode Island “relied and \n8  acted upon the FHWA’s statutory obligation to provide NEVI formula funding consistent with \n9  the IIJA’s requirements.” Id. ¶ 25. The state “structured its EV infrastructure planning and \n10  program delivery model around the multi-year receipt of NEVI Formula Program funding.” Id. \n11  “The suspension of the NEVI Program . . . prevent[ed] Rhode Island from awarding funds to \n12  communities and public entities that had already invested time and resources preparing \n13  proposals. It forced the closure of an active grant opportunity that many applicants had already \n14  initiated or completed internal reviews for . . . .” Id. Moreover, “reopening or redesigning paused \n15  solicitations will require additional State resources and will extend project delivery timelines.” \n16  Id. ¶ 26. “Rhode Island . . . structured its EV infrastructure planning and program delivery model \n17  around the multi-year receipt of NEVI Formula Program funding.” Id. ¶ 25.  \n18  Vermont submitted state deployment plans to FHWA in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which \n19  FHWA approved.

Washington “knew when the NEVI \n5  Formula Program was first established in 2021 that it would receive $71.5 million in total, so \n6  long as it submitted its State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan(s) on time and took \n7  actions to carry them out”—$10.5 million for fiscal year 2022, $15 million for fiscal year 2023, \n8  $15 million for fiscal year 2024, $15 million for fiscal year 2025, and $15 million for fiscal year \n9  2026. Id. ¶¶ 20–21. But the Biondi Letter “made abundantly clear that Washington no longer had \n10  access to the $56.5 million that had been made available with FHWA’s approvals of the \n11  Washington State Plans.” Id. ¶ 35. Washington “planned to invest the $71.5 million in NEVI \n12  formula funds along with $18 million in private match for the deployment of [direct-current] fast \n13  charging . . . to ensure charging availability every 50 miles.” Id. ¶ 28.

Such authorizations “were \n18  made under the expectation that the State would receive its NEVI Formula Program funds as \n19  mandated by the IIJA . . . .” Id. ¶ 24. Further, “[b]ecause Washington does not have funds to \n20  cover the projects for which it sought proposals in the absence of its NEVI Formula Program \n21  funding, the State has had to halt all NEVI Formula Program funded work; it cannot award a \n22  single grant, enter a single contract, or make any progress toward . . . fulfil[ling] the purpose of \n23  the IIJA . . . .” Id. 36. \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 29 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 30 of 66\n \n1  Wisconsin “prepared and provided to the FHWA its State Plans for fiscal years 2022–\n2  2025,” which FHWA approved. Dkt. No. 26 ¶¶ 9–10. FHWA’s approval of Wisconsin’s plans \n3  made $61,901,479 in NEVI Formula Program funds “available to Wisconsin for obligation”—\n4  $11,642,061 for fiscal year 2022, $16,753,057 for fiscal year 2023, $16,753,173 for fiscal year \n5  2024, and $16,753,188 for fiscal year 2025. Id. ¶¶ 10–11. But the Biondi Letter “made clear that \n6  Wisconsin . . . would not have access to the total in FY 22–25 funds which had been made \n7  available to [the state] through its State Plan Approvals.” Id. ¶ 18. Wisconsin “relied and acted \n8  upon the FHWA’s statutory obligation to provide NEVI formula funding consistent with the \n9  IIJA’s requirements.” Dkt. No. 26 ¶ 19. The state receives approximately 29 percent of its \n10  transportation budget from federal funding. Id. ¶ 4. Between January 2024 and April 1, 2024, \n11  Wisconsin issued 53 grant awards for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Id. ¶ 12. “As of \n12  February 6, 2025, 15 grant awards . . . , representing $7.3 million, remain unobligated. \n13  Wisconsin is unable to continue work implementing these grant awards.” Id. ¶ 19. Including its \n14  funding for fiscal year 2026, “Wisconsin does not have access to approximately $62.65 million \n15  of its remaining apportionment of NEVI Formula Program funding and cannot issue awards \n16  under the current [request for proposal].” Id.  \n17  Defendants attempt to characterize Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries as “potential future injuries \n18  stemming from the possibility that FHWA’s future guidance will negatively impact their \n19  projects.” Dkt. No. 93 at 13. “These allegations,” Defendants argue, “are dependent on \n20  contingencies and speculation regarding the content of FHWA’s updated guidance that may not \n21  materialize.” Id. But this misrepresents the agency action that Plaintiffs have challenged. \n22  Plaintiffs’ case is predicated not on what Defendants might do in the future, but on what \n23  Defendants have already done—namely the “revocation of State Plans and categorical \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 30 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 31 of 66\n \n1  withholding of NEVI funds from obligation.”6 Dkt. No. 99 at 8. As Plaintiffs assert, “Plaintiffs \n2  cannot move forward with previously approved State Plans because, as Defendants admit, they \n3  have revoked those plans and refuse to obligate any additional funds under them.” Id. at 7 \n4  (emphasis added); see supra Section IV.A.1.a.  \n5  An admittedly twentieth-century hypothetical helps to illustrate the hole in Defendants’ \n6  position. Consider a person who, check in hand, is walking to the bank to cash it. When they get \n7  to the bank, they expect to hand the check to a teller, who will negotiate the check and give them \n8  cash in return. The check, after all, has made that money available to them. But while they are en \n9  route, the payor—the person who wrote the check and from whose account the funds will be \n10  drawn—calls the bank and stops payment on the check. When the payee presents the check, will \n11  the teller cash it? If, after stopping payment, the payor calls the payee and advises that, upon \n12  request, they might issue another check on an unspecified future date, is the payee’s position the \n13  same as it would have been had the payor never stopped payment? Defendants’ answer to this \n14  question is yes, irrespective of the rent that the payee cannot now cover, or the gas bill they can \n15  no longer pay. That the payee now has a hole in their budget is not the payor’s problem—indeed, \n16  as far as Defendants are concerned, it is not even a problem at all. \n17  Prior to Defendants’ action here, Plaintiffs’ FHWA-approved State Plans entitled them to \n18  NEVI Formula funding. This is evidenced by FHWA’s obligation and disbursement of funds in \n19  prior fiscal years, as well as by the plan-approval letters—each Plaintiff received three, one each \n20  for fiscal years 2022–23, 2024, and 2025—that FHWA sent, asserting that “funds [were] now \n21  available to [a state] for obligation.” See, e.g., Dkt. 1-7 at 2; see also Dkt. No. 109 at 9:10–12. \n22 \n \n23 \n6 For this reason, Defendants’ reliance on Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296 (1998), and Porter v Jones, 319 F.3d \n483 (9th Cir. 1996), falls short. See Dkt. No. 93 at 13. These cases address contingent future events, not harms \n24  already realized. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 31 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 32 of 66\n \n1  And the IIJA itself entitled the states to these funds. But after Defendants revoked Plaintiffs’ \n2  State Plans, Plaintiffs’ access to NEVI Formula funds evaporated. Under City and County of San \n3  Francisco, this represents an injury-in-fact sufficient to confer standing and, therefore, ripeness. \n4  See 897 F.3d at 1235. \n5  b.  Prudential Ripeness \n6  “To assess prudential ripeness, [the court] must ‘evaluate both the fitness of the issues for \n7  judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’” Irritated \n8  Residents, 10 F.4th at 944 (quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)). A \n9  decision is prudentially ripe for review where the issue “is purely one of statutory interpretation \n10  that would not ‘benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.’” Whitman v. \n11  Am. Trucking Assn’s, 531 U.S. 457, 479 (2001) (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra \n12  Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998)). Here, the issues are fit for review because, as Plaintiffs assert, \n13  “further factual development would not significantly advance the court’s ability to deal with the \n14  legal issues presented.” Dkt. No. 99 at 7 (cleaned up); see also Irritated Residents, 10 F.4th at \n15  944 (finding issue “fit for review because it is purely a legal question presented in [a] concrete \n16  setting”); California v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 476 F. Supp. 3d 994, 1007 (N.D. Cal. \n17  2020) (finding plaintiff’s challenge was “a purely legal one” because it concerned whether a \n18  statute had been “properly construed and implemented by” the agency). Further, Plaintiffs will \n19  suffer hardship if the Court delays its consideration of this case. Without clarity as to the legality \n20  of Defendants’ actions, the fate of Plaintiffs’ EV programming remains uncertain, and “the delay \n21  and uncertainty around NEVI funds exposes [Plaintiffs] to rising costs; loss of site hosts, \n22  financing, and other critical partners; and similar opportunity costs.” Dkt. No. 5 at 22. Plaintiffs \n23  assert that they face “budgetary confusion and uncertainty,” as well as “an increased burden in \n24  administering the NEVI Formula Program . . . .” Id. at 23.  \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 32 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 33 of 66\n \n1  For their part, Defendants do not address prudential ripeness in their brief. At oral \n2  argument, however, Defendants cited Colwell v. Department of Health and Human Services, 558 \n3  F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir. 2009), in which the plaintiffs brought a pre-enforcement challenge to \n4  “Policy Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.” See Dkt. No. 109 at \n5  25:8–26:6. The Ninth Circuit held that the Colwell plaintiffs’ claim was prudentially unripe \n6  because it was ambiguous whether the “Policy Guidance” that the plaintiffs had challenged \n7  comprised mandatory rules that the plaintiffs were compelled to follow, or whether the language \n8  of the “Policy Guidance” was merely suggestive and did not threaten enforcement consequences \n9  for plaintiffs should they fail to comply. Id. at 1127. The court determined that such “ambiguity \n10  [would likely] be reduced or resolved based on the enforcement activities HHS [might] \n11  undertake in the future,” so it deemed the plaintiffs’ claim “not now fit for decision.” Id. at 1128. \n12  But Colwell is inapposite here. Defendants have not issued any guidance, mandatory or \n13  otherwise, for Plaintiffs to challenge. As Plaintiffs assert, the real issue is Defendants’ revocation \n14  of state NEVI deployment plans and FHWA’s subsequent freeze on distribution of NEVI \n15  Formula Program funds. Put another way, Defendants’ issuance (or non-issuance) of updated \n16  NEVI Formula Program guidance has no bearing on the legality or illegality of their revocation \n17  of the State Plans and freezing of the funds. New guidance will not undo the revocation, \n18  irrespective of the substance of that guidance.7 \n19  Having considered the constitutional and prudential issues, the Court concludes that this \n20  case is ripe for consideration.  \n21 \n22 \n \n23 \n7 Although Defendants refer to FHWA’s action on state deployment plans as a “suspension” (Dkt. No. 93 at 12), the \nCourt agrees with Plaintiffs’ assertion that “FHWA’s so-called ‘suspension’ is . . . a revocation,” because the Biondi \n24  Letter “made clear [that FHWA] has no intention of reapproving any previously approved plan” (Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 110).  \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 33 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 34 of 66\n \n1  2.  Final Agency Action \n2  Under the APA, an agency action is not reviewable unless it is a “final agency action.” \n3  5 U.S.C. § 704. The Supreme Court has identified two conditions that must be satisfied for an \n4  agency action to be considered final: (1) “the action must mark the consummation of the \n5  agency’s decisionmaking process”; and (2) “the action must be one by which rights or \n6  obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. \n7  Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (cleaned up). Courts within the Ninth Circuit “look to \n8  factors such as whether the action amounts to a definitive statement of the agency’s position, \n9  whether it has a direct and immediate effect on the day-to-day operations of the subject party, \n10  and if immediate compliance is expected.” Prutehi Litekyan: Save Ritidian v. U.S. Dep’t of the \n11  Airforce, 128 F.4th 1089 (9th Cir. 2025) (quoting Nat’l Lab. Rels. Bd. v. Siren Retail Corp., 99 \n12  F.4th 1118, 1123 (9th Cir. 2024)) (cleaned up). Courts “also focus on the practical and legal \n13  effects of the agency action: The finality element must be interpreted in a pragmatic and flexible \n14  manner.” Id. (quoting Saliba v. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, 47 F.4th 961, 967 (9th Cir. 2022) \n15  (internal quotation marks omitted)). \n16  Here, as will be discussed below, Defendants’ action is properly considered a final \n17  agency action under the APA. “[A]n emerging consensus of district courts recently hearing cases \n18  about different aspects of federal funding freezes” have found such freezes to be final for the \n19  purposes of APA reviewability. Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. U.S. Dep’t of \n20  Agric., No. C25-97, 2025 WL 1116157, at *16 (D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025); see Louisiana v. Biden, \n21  622 F. Supp. 3d 267, 291–92 (W.D. La. 2022) (collecting cases).  \n22  a.  “Consummation” of the Decision Making Process \n23  Defendants argue that they “have not taken ‘final agency action’ reviewable under the \n24  APA,” but have instead just begun the process that will eventually lead to a final action. Dkt. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 34 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 35 of 66\n \n1  No. 93 at 15; Dkt. No. 93 at 15–17. “FHWA has not asserted its ultimate administrative position \n2  with respect to NEVI guidance,” Defendants argue. Id. at 16. “[R]ather[,] it has merely stated \n3  that it is reviewing NEVI guidance and evaluating whether it accords with current policies.” Id. \n4  Defendants take the position that “FHWA’s interim decisions with respect to prior guidance will \n5  be subsumed by its ultimate consideration of State obligations submitted pursuant to updated \n6  guidance . . . .” Id. at 16–17. \n7  But Defendants mischaracterize their conduct. FHWA’s “ultimate administrative position \n8  with respect to NEVI guidance” (id. at 16) is not the issue here, nor is the agency’s present and \n9  ongoing review of NEVI guidance. See City & County of San Francisco v. Trump, No. C25-\n10  1350, 2025 WL 1282637, at *34 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2025). Rather, Defendants’ complained-of \n11  conduct is the rescission of the prior guidance and revocation of the State Deployment Plans, the \n12  practical result of which is a funding freeze—the “categorical withholding of NEVI funds from \n13  obligation.” Dkt. No. 99 at 8. In reviewing actions that various federal agencies have taken this \n14  year for the express purpose of aligning themselves with executive orders issued by the new \n15  administration, Courts have characterized decisions that have resulted in categorical funding \n16  freezes as the “consummation of [an] agency’s decisionmaking process to comply with the \n17  President’s executive order . . . .” New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 715621, at *8 (quoting Drs. For \n18  Am. v. Off. Of Pers. Mgmt., 766 F. Supp. 3d 39, 50 (D.D.C. 2025). Moreover, from a practical \n19  standpoint, “there are no further steps [Defendants] need to take to determine whether they will \n20  freeze that funding,” thus indicating consummation of the decision making process. \n21  Woonasquatucket River, 2025 WL 1116157, at *15. \n22  Further, examined in light of the Ninth Circuit’s indicia of finality, the funding freeze \n23  amounts to a definitive statement of the agency’s position, and Plaintiff States have demonstrated \n24  that the freeze has had an immediate effect on the day-to-day operations of their respective \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 35 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 36 of 66\n \n1  transportation agencies. The February 6, 2025, Biondi Letter asserts that “FHWA is updating the \n2  NEVI Formula Program Guidance to align with current U.S. DOT policy and priorities, \n3  including those set forth in DOT Order 2100.7, titled ‘Ensuring Reliance Upon Sound Economic \n4  Analysis in Department of Transportation Policies, Programs, and Activities.’” Dkt. No. 1-9 at \n5  2–3. Given the concrete policy and priorities described in DOT Order 2100.7, which contemplate \n6  factors such as communities’ “marriage and birth rates” and “vaccine and mask mandates” (Dkt. \n7  No. 1-10 (DOT Order No. 2100.7) at 4), the assertion in the Biondi Letter clearly “‘mark[s] the \n8  consummation of’ the [FHWA’s] ‘decision-making process’” that funding not in line with DOT \n9  Order 2100.7 will not be forthcoming. It is one thing for Defendants to commit to making \n10  funding decisions that are generally aligned with the direction that a cabinet-level agency \n11  envisions. It is quite another to determine that, when choosing the locations of electric vehicle \n12  charging stations, states will need to consider specific, data-based criteria such as whether \n13  communities have “marriage and birth rates higher than the national average”; or black-and-\n14  white policy determinations such as whether a jurisdiction maintains mandates regarding \n15  vaccines and masks. Such fully formed directives and attention to detail are far more indicative \n16  of the end of the decision-making process, not the beginning. \n17  As to the immediate effect on day-to-day operations that Defendants’ actions have had, \n18  Plaintiffs provide multiple examples. For example:  \n19  •  On March 28, 2025, California sought to submit to FHWA an “authorization \nrequest for construction incurred for a NEVI-funded project . . . for $310,302 \n20  incurred in constructing a Tesla charging station.” Dkt. No. 8 (Lam Decl.) ¶ 10. \nBut the employee who made the request “received the following message from \n21  the online funding portal: ‘Request cannot be processed. One or more Program \nCode balances has been exceeded.’” Id.; see Dkt. No. 8-1 (Lam Decl. Ex. 1) at 3. \n22  Plaintiffs assert that “[s]ince FHWA issued the Notice, Plaintiff States have been \nunable to obligate new NEVI funds, even for projects in previously approved \n23  State Plans.” Dkt. No. 5 at 9. Defendants’ funding freeze has caused, among other \nthings, “disruptions to State NEVI implementation programs [and] delays in \n24  construction of infrastructure.” Id. at 10.  \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 36 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 37 of 66\n \n1   \n \n2  It is hard to conceive of a more exemplary effect on day-to-day operations than a shovel-ready \n3  construction project suddenly delayed because its funding has failed to materialize. Further: \n4  •  Washington avers that it “has had to transition the full-time employee it hired for \nNEVI work to another temporary assignment and has been unable to hire the \n5  other full-time employee for which [it] received hiring approval.” Dkt. No. 28 \n¶ 37.  \n6   \n \n7  •  Rhode Island asserts that Defendants’ actions “forced the closure of an active \ngrant opportunity that many applicants had already initiated or completed internal \n8  reviews for, delaying project pipelines.” Dkt. No. 24 ¶ 25.  \n \n9  •  Oregon “cannot execute existing contracts without significant modification or \nfund the construction phases for . . . eight corridors.” Dkt. No. 23 ¶ 31.  \n10   \n11   See also supra Section IV.A.1.a. These are not representative instances of plans that might be \n12  canceled, or priorities that might need to be rearranged. Rather, these are contingencies that \n13  Plaintiffs presently face and are demonstrative of the immediate impact of Defendants’ actions. \n14  b.  Determination of Rights or Obligations/Legal Consequences \n15  It is also clear that “legal consequences will flow” from Defendants’ actions. Defendants \n16  argue that an inquiry into whether legal consequences will flow “turns on whether [Defendants’] \n17  actions result in ‘concrete consequences.’” Dkt. No. 93 at 17 (quoting S. Cal. All. Of Publicly \n18  Owned Treatment Works v. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency, 8 F.4th 831, 836 (9th Cir. 2021)). “That \n19  threshold is not cleared if ‘subsequent agency decision making is necessary to create any \n20  practical consequences.’” Id. (quoting S. Cal. All., 8 F.4th at 837). But if the budgetary \n21  reshuffling, cancelation and delay of construction projects, and scrapping of Plaintiffs’ State \n22  Plans do not constitute “practical consequences,” it is difficult to imagine what would. See supra \n23  Sections IV.A.1.a. \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 37 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 38 of 66\n \n1  Further, it is disingenuous for Defendants to assert that there are no practical \n2  consequences to their actions because, “[t]o be sure, there are currently no approved State plans.” \n3  Dkt. No. 93 at 17. There are, of course, currently no approved State Plans because Defendants \n4  revoked the approved State Plans that already existed and had previously been approved. Indeed, \n5  Defendants’ arguments here ring hollow. Defendants assert that “Plaintiffs are unable to submit \n6  requests for new obligations.” Id. But before Defendants’ revocation of Plaintiffs’ State Plans, \n7  Plaintiffs absolutely were able to submit requestions for new obligations. That Plaintiffs were \n8  entitled to federal funding before Defendants acted, and unentitled to it afterward, is a practical \n9  consequence. The IIJA itself creates a step-by-step process by which a state may secure NEVI \n10  Formula funds. After the crucial approval of a state’s plan, funds become “available . . . for \n11  obligation.” See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1-7 at 2. Congress dictated that, under the law, FHWA could not \n12  consider a request for obligation made prior to the agency’s approval of a plan, but could \n13  consider such a request afterward. By statute, approval (and, by corollary, revocation) of a state \n14  plan creates (or destroys) a legal interest with respect to the availability of NEVI Formula funds \n15  to that state. When Defendants took steps to quash that Congressionally-conceived interest, they \n16  engendered legal consequences. \n17  The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs have established both prongs of the Bennett test, and \n18  Defendants’ actions here are properly considered final agency action for the purposes of \n19  reviewability under the APA. \n20  B.  Preliminary Injunction \n21  The Court now turns to the merits of Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction. As \n22  discussed above, \n23  [t]o obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish that: \n(1) it is likely to prevail on the merits of its substantive claims, \n24  (2) it is likely to suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent an \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 38 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 39 of 66\n \n1  injunction, (3) the balance of equities favors an injunction, and \n(4) an injunction is in the public interest.  \n2   \n3  All. for the Wild Rockies, 68 F.4th at 490. “Where the government is a party to a case in which a \n4  preliminary injunction is sought, the balance of the equities and public interest factors merge.” \n5  Roman, 977 F.3d at 940–41. The Court addresses each element in turn. \n6  1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n7  Plaintiffs’ complaint comprises six causes of action—three violations of the APA (Dkt. \n8  No. 1 ¶¶ 213–257); violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine (id. ¶¶ 258–269); violation of \n9  the Take Care Clause (id. ¶¶ 270–277); and common-law ultra vires action (id. ¶¶ 278–286). As \n10  noted by Defendants, Plaintiffs do not discuss their Take Care Clause and ultra vires claims in \n11  their motion and do not rely on these claims to support a preliminary injunction. See Dkt. No. 93 \n12  at 26 n.2. The Court will thus consider Plaintiffs’ request for an injunction on the basis of their \n13  first four claims.  \n14  a.  First APA Claim: In Excess of Statutory Authority \nUnder the APA, the Court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \n15 \nand conclusions found to be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \n16 \nshort of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). Plaintiffs assert that “[b]y unilaterally revoking \n17 \nall State Plans and withholding congressionally appropriated funding, Defendants acted in excess \n18 \nof statutory authority and contrary to the IIJA.” Dkt. No. 5 at 12. \n19 \nWhen examining a statute, a court “start[s] with the plain meaning of the statute’s text.” \n20 \nHunsaker v. United States, 902 F.3d 963, 967 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Father M. v. Various Tort \n21 \nClaimants (In re Roman Catholic Archbishop of Portland in Or.), 661 F.3d 417, 432 (9th Cir. \n22 \n2011)). The statute under review here, the IIJA, provides that: “$5,000,000,000, to remain \n23 \navailable until expended for amounts made available for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 39 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 40 of 66\n \n1  shall be to carry out a National Electric Vehicle Formula Program.” 135 Stat. at 1421. “[F]or \n2  each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, the Secretary [of Transportation] shall distribute among \n3  the States the funds made available under this paragraph in this Act . . . .” Id. at 1422. The statute \n4  fixes each state’s share of the appropriated funds in accordance with the pre-existing statutory \n5  formula used for apportionment of funds in the Federal-Aid Highway Program. See id.; 23 \n6  U.S.C. § 104. The language of the IIJA clearly defines the Secretary of Transportation’s duty to \n7  distribute funds under the law and provides the Secretary with no room to improvise. See Serv. \n8  Emps. Int’l Union v. United States, 598 F.3d 1110, 1113 (9th Cir. 2010) (finding that Congress’s \n9  use of the word “shall” “does not confer on the agency discretion to decide how much ought to \n10  be paid”). \n11  As Plaintiffs point out, the statute authorizes the Secretary to “withhold or withdraw” \n12  NEVI Formula funds under certain limited circumstances, in accordance with a prescribed \n13  procedure. See Dkt. No. 5 at 12. If a state does not submit to the Secretary a plan that \n14  “describ[es] how [it] intends to use [its NEVI Formula] funds . . . for each fiscal year in which \n15  funds are made available,” or if a state “has not taken actions to carry out its plan,” then the \n16  Secretary may withhold or withdraw that state’s share of the funds. 135 Stat. at 1422. But before \n17  doing so, the Secretary “shall provide notice to a State on the intent to withhold or withdraw \n18  funds not less than 60 days before withholding or withdrawing any funds, during which time the \n19  State shall have an opportunity to appeal a decision to withhold or withdraw funds directly to the \n20  Secretary.” Id. And if, after complying with these procedural requirements, the Secretary is still \n21  determined to withhold NEVI Formula funds from a state, the Secretary has clearly prescribed \n22  channels through which the funds may be redirected. Withheld or withdrawn funds may be \n23  awarded “on a competitive basis to local jurisdictions within the State [from which they were \n24  withheld or withdrawn] for use on projects that meet the eligibility requirements.” Id. If the \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 40 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 41 of 66\n \n1  funds are not awarded to local jurisdictions within the state from which they were originally \n2  withheld or withdrawn, then they must be distributed among other states “in the same manner as \n3  funds distributed for that fiscal year”—that is, by the NEVI apportionment formula described \n4  above. Id. This is not ambiguous language; there is little, if any, room for interpretation of what \n5  the IIJA commands Defendants to do. But the record indicates that Defendants have declined to \n6  follow their clear statutory instructions. \n7    In freezing NEVI Formula funds, Defendants have “withheld or withdrawn” funds in a \n8  manner both procedurally and substantively different from that prescribed in the statute. The \n9  language of the statute, as described above, is straightforward. It obligates Defendants to \n10  distribute the NEVI Formula funds. It specifies how much, to whom, and for what purposes. It \n11  does not permit a categorial freeze premised on the Department of Transportation’s realignment \n12  with new executive policies, and it does not contemplate the Secretary’s revocation of State \n13  Plans that FHWA has already approved. \n14    Defendants argue that their revocation of the State Plans was proper because, \n15  “[c]onsistent with statutory authority and established practice”: (1) FHWA has “the authority to \n16  revisit and reevaluate past guidance”; and (2) the State Plans are required to comply with FHWA \n17  guidance. See Dkt. No. 93 at 18–19. The first point is reasonable, and the Court agrees with \n18  Defendants that barring an agency from revising previously promulgated guidance “would mean \n19  that agencies could never correct past actions, and instead would be perpetually bound by \n20  policies with which they disagree.” Id. at 19; see Solar Energy Indus. Ass’n v. Fed. Energy Reg. \n21  Comm’n, 80 F.4th 956, 979 (9th Cir. 2023) (“The APA does not require ‘regulatory agencies [to] \n22  establish rules of conduct to last forever,’ [and] . . . [a]n agency may change its position for any \n23  number of reasons, such as a change in factual circumstances or a shift in its policy priorities.” \n24  (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 41 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 42 of 66\n \n1  43 (1983)). But Defendants have not actually “corrected” past actions here, because they have \n2  not issued any new guidance with which the State Plans must comply. Defendants assert, without \n3  authority, that “[a]s an adjunct of its ability to update new NEVI Program guidance, FHWA has \n4  the authority to suspend state plans for unobligated funds pending the issuance of that guidance.” \n5  Dkt. No. 93 at 19–20. Because Congress “required the issuance of guidance for a program that \n6  necessarily extends across multiple administrations,” Defendants argue, “and delegated the \n7  issuance of that guidance to the agency tasked with administering the program,” they “must have \n8  the authority to briefly suspend State plans while the congressionally required guidance is \n9  updated.” Id. at 20. \n10    Although the Court sees the logic in Defendants’ position that it may reconsider \n11  administrative guidance issued by the prior administration, it does not find authority for \n12  suspending State Plans in the statutory text (or caselaw), nor does it see the “established \n13  practice” to which Defendants refer. Moreover, at oral argument, Defendants appeared to take \n14  the rather extreme position that this administration could not be expected to abide by any \n15  regulatory guidance that had been installed or promulgated before January 20, 2025. See Dkt. \n16  No. 109 at 23:23–24:1. As discussed above, the IIJA contemplates FHWA’s withholding and \n17  withdrawing a state’s NEVI Formula funds under very limited circumstances, none of which has \n18  obtained here. Further, Defendants provide no authority for their presumption that guidance is \n19  necessarily revised on a “suspend, revoke, and replace” basis. In prior years, when FHWA \n20  updated its NEVI Formula Program Guidance, the revised and reissued guidance expressly \n21  superseded the guidance it replaced, resulting in a seamless transition from one regime to the \n22  next. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 93-1 (2024 NEVI Formula Program Guidance) at 81 (“The attached \n23  guidance supersedes the guidance that was issued on June 2, 2023.”). When FHWA previously \n24  updated its guidance, it required states “to submit an EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan (Plan) \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 42 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 43 of 66\n \n1  on an annual basis that describe[d] how the State intend[ed] to use its apportioned NEVI \n2  Formula Program funds in accordance with [updated] guidance.” Id. But new guidance did not \n3  revoke or suspend plans approved under the old guidance and did not cancel projects conceived \n4  under the old guidance.  \n5  Moreover, even Defendants’ repeated assertion that their actions merely amount to a \n6  “temporary pause” (Dkt. No. 93 at 12, 28) and a “brief suspen[sion]” (id. at 20), are unavailing \n7  with respect to Defendants’ ultimate compliance with the law. The President issued the \n8  “Unleashing American Energy” Executive Order on his first day in office. Secretary Duffy \n9  issued DOT Order No. 2100.7 on his first full day in office. In contrast, the Biondi Letter advised \n10  on February 6, 2025, that new NEVI Formula Program guidance would be “published for public \n11  comment in the spring,” thereby giving FHWA a leisurely four-and-a-half-month timeframe to \n12  take its first step toward rebooting the program. Dkt. No. 1-8 at 3. But spring has come and gone, \n13  and FHWA has not published new guidance. Given FHWA’s pace, as well as its failure to meet \n14  its self-imposed spring deadline, it appears unlikely (if not impossible at this point) that new \n15  guidance will be issued, commented-upon, and then finalized before the end of fiscal year 2025 \n16  on September 30, 2025, to say nothing of the fact that, upon the issuance of the new guidance, \n17  NEVI Formula funds will remain unavailable to states until they draft and submit—and FHWA \n18  approves—new state deployment plans. \n19  The Court need only look at a calendar to spot the disingenuousness of Defendants’ \n20  position. President Biden signed IIJA into law on November 15, 2021. It took FHWA 87 days, \n21  until February 10, 2022, to issue guidance. It then took Plaintiff Washington another 172 days, \n22  until August 1, 2022, to submit its state plan to FHWA. See Dkt. No. 28-1 at 5. FHWA took 45 \n23  days, until September 14, 2022, to approve Washington’s plan, at which point fiscal year 2022 \n24  funds became available to Washington for obligation. See Dkt. No. 1-7 at 2. All told, then, 304 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 43 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 44 of 66\n \n1  days elapsed between the enactment of the IIJA and the availability of funds. Defendants \n2  rescinded FHWA’s NEVI Formula Program guidance and revoked the State Plans on February 6, \n3  2025. See Dkt. No. 1-9 at 2. The rescission left FHWA in the same position it was in on the date \n4  that the IIJA was enacted—that is, back at square one and statutorily obligated to provide \n5  guidance to the states on how to access the congressionally appropriated NEVI Formula funds. \n6  See 135 Stat. at 1421–22. If the Parties were to adhere to the same timeline that they followed in \n7  2021–22, then Washington could expect to again be eligible to obligate NEVI formula funds on \n8  or about December 7, 2025, more than two months after the end of fiscal year 2025. See 31 \n9  U.S.C. § 1102 (“The fiscal year of the Treasury begins on October 1 of each year and ends on \n10  September 30 of the following year.”). Notwithstanding Defendants’ assertion that “FHWA will \n11  re-issue NEVI guidance, and pursuant to that guidance, States will be permitted to submit \n12  updated plans and requests for obligations,” the Court is skeptical that all of the paperwork—at a \n13  minimum, agency guidance, State Plans, and agency approvals, to say nothing of the individual \n14  projects that must then be approved by FHWA—will be signed, sealed, and delivered in time for \n15  the Secretary to fulfill the statutory requirement to distribute the fiscal year 2025 funds by the \n16  end of fiscal year 2025.  \n17  When the IIJA was enacted, the statute provided the Secretary of Transportation with 90 \n18  days to issue agency guidance on NEVI Formula Program funds, a deadline the agency duly \n19  complied with. See Dkt. No. 93-1 at 11. Since Defendants committed themselves to re-issuing a \n20  new version of the guidance on February 6, 2025, more than four months—far in excess of 90 \n21  days—have passed. Were Defendants serious about their obligation to distribute the NEVI \n22  Formula funds as mandated by Congress, they might have displayed more alacrity so as to ensure \n23  timely distribution of the funds. That Defendants have been content to do nothing more than \n24  assert an “aim[] to have undated draft NEVI Formula Guidance published for public comment in \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 44 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 45 of 66\n \n1  the spring” belies their professed intention of timely bringing the NEVI Formula Program back \n2  online and in accordance with the statute. At oral argument, the Court asked Defendants’ counsel \n3  when FHWA would provide states with its updated guidance, but counsel was not able to \n4  provide the Court with a date, or even a rough timeframe. See Dkt. No. 109 at 21:12–15. \n5  Finally, as explained in the Biondi Letter, FHWA actually intends to issue updated NEVI \n6  Formula Program guidance twice—first in a draft version “for public comment,” then as “final” \n7  guidance that “responds to the comments received.” Dkt. No. 1-9 at 3. FHWA will not permit \n8  states to submit new state deployment plans until the “final” version of the guidance has been \n9  issued, which will not happen until after the “public comment period has closed,” thereby \n10  extending the purportedly “brief” pause in the NEVI Formula Program even more. Id. Such foot-\n11  dragging strikes the Court as completely unnecessary. Congress did not mandate notice-and-\n12  comment rulemaking when directing DOT to issue NEVI Formula Program guidance. When \n13  FHWA developed and issued the first version of NEVI Formula Program guidance in 2021–22, \n14  it solicited public input just 15 days after the IIJA was enacted and, even then, committed to \n15  “issu[ing] guidance and begin[ning] other activities related to implementation” of the IIJA while \n16  still fielding suggestions from the public. IIJA Request for Information, 86 Fed. Reg. 68297, \n17  68298 (Dec. 1, 2021). All told, what Defendants have done, and what they continue to do (or not \n18  do), truly renders their actions here a funding freeze, not a temporary pause or brief suspension. \n19  Thus, the Court finds that Defendants have likely exceeded their statutory authority and \n20  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their first cause of action. \n21  b.  Second APA Claim: Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n22  Under the APA, a court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \n23  and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n24  accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). “Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, [a \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 45 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 46 of 66\n \n1  court’s] scope of review is narrow and deferential. Arrington v. Daniels, 516 F.3d 1106, 1112 \n2  (9th Cir. 2008). “Agency action is valid ‘if a reasonable basis exists for [the agency’s] \n3  decision.’” Id. (quoting Kern Cnty. Farm Bureau v. Allen, 450 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir. 2006)) \n4  (alteration in original). “A reasonable basis exists where the agency ‘considered the relevant \n5  factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.’” Id. \n6  (quoting Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 415 F.3d 1078, 1093 \n7  (9th Cir. 2005)). Where an agency has changed its policy, it must “show that there are good \n8  reasons for the new policy,” and it must demonstrate that it has considered any “serious reliance \n9  interests” prior to changing course. F.C.C. v. Fox Television Studios, 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). \n10  An agency must also demonstrate that it has considered “alternatives . . . within the ambit of the \n11  existing policy.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) \n12  (cleaned up). Further, an agency action is “arbitrary and capricious” where “the agency has relied \n13  on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider . . . .” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \n14  Here, Defendants’ rescission of the NEVI Formula Program guidance and revocation of \n15  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans was arbitrary and capricious. Defendants \n16  attempt to rely on two paragraphs in the Biondi Letter to satisfy their burden under the APA but \n17  fall far short of adequately explaining their actions. See Dkt. No. 1-9 at 2–3. “The FHWA is \n18  updating the NEVI Formula Program Guidance to align with current U.S. DOT policy and \n19  priorities, including those set forth in DOT Order 2100.7, titled ‘Ensuring Reliance Upon Sound \n20  Economic Analysis in Department of Transportation Policies, Programs, and Activities.’” Id. \n21  This sentence represents the entirety of Defendants’ stated reasoning behind the decision. \n22  It is not evident that FHWA considered relevant factors that informed its decision. The \n23  agency explained that it was “updating the NEVI Formula Program Guidance to align with \n24  current U.S. DOT policy and priorities, including those set forth in DOT Order 2100.7, titled \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 46 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 47 of 66\n \n1  ‘Ensuring Reliance Upon Sound Economic Analysis in Department of Transportation Policies, \n2  Programs, and Activities.’” Dkt. No. 1-9 at 2–3. In directing the Secretary of Transportation to \n3  develop NEVI Formula Program guidance, Congress enumerated eight specific factors to \n4  consider, as well as “any other factors, as determined by the Secretary”: \n5  (1) the distance between publicly available electric vehicle \ncharging infrastructure;  \n6   \n(2) connections to the electric grid, including electric distribution \n7  upgrades; vehicle-to-grid integration, including smart charge \nmanagement or other protocols that can minimize impacts to the \n8  grid; alignment with electric distribution interconnection \nprocesses, and plans for the use of renewable energy sources to \n9  power charging and energy storage;  \n \n10  (3) the proximity of existing off-highway travel centers, fuel \nretailers, and small businesses to electric vehicle charging \n11  infrastructure acquired or funded under this paragraph in this Act; \n \n12  (4) the need for publicly available electric vehicle charging \ninfrastructure in rural corridors and underserved or disadvantaged \n13  communities; \n \n14  (5) the long-term operation and maintenance of publicly available \nelectric vehicle charging infrastructure to avoid stranded assets and \n15  protect the investment of public funds in that infrastructure; \n \n16  (6) existing private, national, State, local, Tribal, and territorial \ngovernment electric vehicle charging infrastructure programs and \n17  incentives; \n \n18  (7) fostering enhanced, coordinated, public-private or private \ninvestment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure; [and] \n19   \n(8) meeting current and anticipated market demands for electric \n20  vehicle charging infrastructure, including with regard to power \nlevels and charging speed, and minimizing the time to charge \n21  current and anticipated vehicles[.] \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 47 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 48 of 66\n \n1  135 Stat. at 1423. But even given the broad discretion of this catch-all factor, the scope of which \n2  is subject to interpretation,8 the Biondi Letter does not “articulate[] a rational connection \n3  between the facts found and the choices made.” Arrington, 516 F.3d at 1112. Indeed, the Biondi \n4  Letter does not articulate any facts at all and instead provides only an implication that the current \n5  NEVI Formula Program guidance does not “align with current U.S. DOT policy and priorities.” \n6  Dkt. No. 1-9 at 2–3.9 The Biondi Letter does not explain how the current guidance is out-of-step \n7  with current policy and, therefore, does not explain why it needs to be rescinded. A court “may \n8  not infer an agency’s reasoning from mere silence.” Arrington, 516 F.3d at 1112. \n9  Further, the Biondi Letter does not demonstrate that FHWA considered the serious \n10  reliance interests engendered by the old policy—namely, the administrative, economic, and \n11  infrastructural arrangements that the states had made based on FHWA’s approval of prior State \n12  Plans. Indeed, the Biondi Letter is again completely silent as to any reliance issues it considered \n13  (if any). The Biondi Letter also does not demonstrate that FHWA considered any alternatives \n14  beyond the wholesale rescission of the guidance and revocation of the State Plans. In their \n15  opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion here, Defendants only conclusorily assert that “FHWA [has not] \n16  acted arbitrarily and capriciously.” Dkt. No. 93 at 7. They ignore the substantive shortcomings of \n17  the Biondi Letter as an instrument by which FHWA changed policy and instead focus on \n18  FHWA’s authority to make the change in the first place—that is, Defendants ignore the why and \n19 \n \n20  8 Plaintiffs assert that, because the IIJA’s reference to “‘other factors’ that can influence the Guidance follow[s] \nmore specific terms[, u]nder the principle of ejusdem generis [sic] . . . , the general term should be understood as a \nreference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.” Dkt. No. 5 at 16 (quoting Norfolk &. Western Ry. \n21 \nCo. v. Am. Train Dispatchers Ass’n, 499 U.S. 117, 129 (1991)). Defendants do not address this argument in their \nbriefing. See generally Dkt. No. 93. Because the Court finds that Defendants’ action was arbitrary and capricious for \n22 \nreasons aside from Defendants’ alleged consideration of improper factors, the Court does not take up the question of \nhow broad Congress intended the scope of these “other factors” to be. \n23 \n9 It is true that the Biden-era guidance on EV infrastructure did not incorporate positions regarding vaccine and \nmask mandates and federal immigration enforcement, two subjects of DOT’s new policy and priorities. See Dkt. \n24  No. 93-1 at 34–35. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 48 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 49 of 66\n \n1  the how of their conduct and exclusively predicate their argument on the what. This is not \n2  sufficient to survive arbitrary-and-capricious review. \n3  Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants’ action was likely arbitrary and capricious, \n4  and that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their second cause of action. \n5  c.  Third APA Claim: Not in Accordance with Law and Without \nObservance of Procedure Required by Law \n6 \n \n7  Under the APA, a court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \n8  and conclusions found to be— (A) . . . not in accordance with law” or “(D) without observance \n9  of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Plaintiffs argue that Defendants violated the \n10  APA by failing to abide by the IIJA’s “specific procedures for the withholding or withdrawal of \n11  NEVI funds.” Dkt. No. 5 at 17. Defendants explain their conduct by characterizing it not as a \n12  withholding or withdrawal of funds, but rather as an exercise of FHWA’s authority to “guide \n13  precisely how apportioned funds are utilized.” Dkt. No. 93 at 18. But common sense counsels \n14  against this characterization. \n15  Defendants admit that they have instituted “a temporary pause on the distribution of \n16  NEVI funds.” Dkt. No. 93 at 28. Irrespective of what Defendants are doing concurrently with the \n17  temporary pause—including “review[ing]” and “restructuring” NEVI Formula Program guidance \n18  (id.)—the Court cannot interpret a “temporary pause” as anything other than the withholding of \n19  funds. The faucet has been turned off. As discussed above, the IIJA prescribes specific \n20  circumstances where the Secretary of Transportation may withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula \n21  funds. See supra Section II.B.1.c. If a state has not submitted a plan, or if it has failed to take \n22  action to carry out its plan, then funds may be withheld or withdrawn. 135 Stat. at 1422. But \n23  Plaintiff States have submitted plans and were apportioned funds. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1-8. There \n24  is no indication that the Secretary of Transportation has determined that any of the Plaintiff \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 49 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 50 of 66\n \n1  States has failed to take action to carry out its plan. Regardless, FHWA instituted its “temporary \n2  pause.” And even if the Secretary of Transportation had properly determined that it might be \n3  appropriate under the statute to withhold or withdraw funds, the statute required that 60 days’ \n4  notice be provided to the states prior to any withholding or withdrawal of funds, “during which \n5  the States shall have an opportunity to appeal a decision to withhold or withdraw funds directly \n6  to the Secretary.” 135 Stat. at 1422. There is no indication that, prior to the issuance of the \n7  Biondi Letter, any of this happened. Defendants’ actions were thus not in accordance with the \n8  IIJA. \n9  Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants’ action was likely not in accordance with law \n10  and was performed without observance of procedure required by law. Plaintiffs are likely to \n11  succeed on their third cause of action. \n12  d.  Violation of Separation of Powers \n13  “The Constitution limits [the President’s] functions in the lawmaking process to the \n14  recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad.” Youngstown Sheet \n15  & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952). “Aside from the power of veto, the President is \n16  without authority to thwart congressional will by canceling appropriations passed by Congress. \n17  Simply put, ‘the President does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend the funds.’” City \n18  & County of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1232 (quoting In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 261 \n19  n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013)). Plaintiffs assert that “Defendants’ attempt to withhold NEVI funds from \n20  Plaintiff States [is a] violation of the clear language of the IIJA” and, therefore, violates the \n21  separation-of-powers doctrine. Dkt. No. 5 at 19. Quoting City and County of San Francisco, \n22  Plaintiffs assert that “Defendants ‘claimed for themselves Congress’s exclusive spending power,’ \n23  while ‘also attempting to coopt Congress’s power to legislate.’” Id. (cleaned up) (quoting City & \n24  County of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1234)). \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 50 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 51 of 66\n \n1  For Defendants’ part, beyond a general assertion that Plaintiffs’ separation-of-powers \n2  claim is meritless, their position here is somewhat confusing. Defendants direct most of their \n3  argument on the subject toward defending against a claim that they admit Plaintiffs have not \n4  actually alleged. See Dkt. No. 93 at 24 (“Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiffs have not \n5  explicitly pled an Impoundment Control Act claim.”); id. at 21–26. Though well-reasoned and \n6  forcefully argued, Defendants’ lengthy discussion on the inapplicability of Impoundment Control \n7  Act is irrelevant to the matter at hand.10 What is more, Defendants’ counsel conceded at oral \n8  argument that the Executive here has not attempted to utilize the Impoundment Control Act to \n9  propose rescinding the funds allocated by Congress. See Dkt. No. 109 at 39:12–13. \n10  Other courts faced with similar issues have resolved separation-of-powers questions \n11  without recourse to the Impoundment Control Act. For example, in finding that the President had \n12  overstepped his Constitutional authority when he refused to spend Congressionally appropriated \n13  funds, the Ninth Circuit in City and County of San Francisco mentioned the Impoundment \n14  Control Act only in passing, and even then merely to demonstrate that in enacting the statute, \n15  “Congress ha[d] affirmatively and authoritatively spoken” on “the President’s duty to execute \n16  appropriations laws.” City & County of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1234. And in a recent case in \n17  this District regarding the Executive Branch’s alleged interference with the distribution of \n18  Congressionally appropriated funds, the court no need to discuss the Impoundment Control Act. \n19  See King County v. Turner, No. C25-814, 2025 WL 1582368, at *14–25 (W.D. Wash. June 3, \n20  2025). \n21 \n22 \n \n23 \n10 Plaintiffs cite the Impoundment Control Act to draw attention to “the general procedure by which the Executive \nmay propose to Congress to either rescind or cancel funds” and to point out that that procedure is not applicable to \n24  the facts of this case. See Dkt. No. 5 at 19. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 51 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 52 of 66\n \n1  “The [Appropriations] Clause has a ‘fundamental and comprehensive purpose . . . to \n2  assure that public funds will be spent according to the letter of the difficult judgments reached by \n3  Congress as to the common good and not according to the individual favor of Government \n4  agents.’” United States v. McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1175 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Off. of Pers. \n5  Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 427–28 (1990)). Here, the complained-of funding freeze was \n6  conceived in Section 7(a) of the President’s “Unleashing American Energy” Executive Order, \n7  not the IIJA. In the Executive Order, the President directed “[a]ll agencies [to] immediately \n8  pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the . . . Infrastructure Investment and Jobs \n9  Act (Public Law 117–58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations \n10  made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” \n11  “Unleashing Am. Energy,” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357. As discussed above, Defendants gave effect to \n12  the President’s order through the issuance of the Biondi Letter, which instituted the “temporary \n13  pause” in the NEVI Formula Program. See Dkt. No. 1-9. Under City and County of San \n14  Francisco, implementing the pause was an inappropriate seizure of Congress’s budgetary \n15  authority: “Absent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or \n16  withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals.” City & County \n17  of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1235. Observed from the other direction, “[t]here is sufficient \n18  evidence that, in implementing the funding freeze, the Agency Defendants withheld funding that \n19  Congress did not tie to compliance with the President’s policy priorities in the . . . the Unleashing \n20  EO.” New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 715621, at *11. \n21  Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants’ action likely violated the separation-of-\n22  powers doctrine, and that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their fourth cause of action. \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 52 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 53 of 66\n \n1  2.  Imminent/Irreparable Harm \n2  Plaintiffs must establish that they will likely suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n3  preliminary relief. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. “Irreparable harm is traditionally defined as harm for \n4  which there is no adequate legal remedy, such as an award of damages.” Ariz. Dream Act Coal. \n5  v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Canyon Television \n6  & Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir. 1991)).  \n7  Plaintiffs allege two kinds of irreparable harm: \n8  First, Defendants’ actions interrupt and impede Plaintiff States’ \nongoing programs to deploy EV charging infrastructure, thwart \n9  policies these States adopted to combat climate change, reduce \nharmful pollution, broaden access to EVs, and create jobs. Second, \n10  Defendants’ . . . actions increase Plaintiff States’ administrative \nburdens in implementing the NEVI Formula Program and interfere \n11  with their ability to budget, plan ,and serve their residents. \n \n12   \nDkt. No. 5 at 20. Plaintiffs assert that “[n]either type of harm is compensable with money \n13 \ndamages,” and that these harms “already have occurred and, absent entry of an injunction, will \n14 \ncontinue.” Id. Defendants present three arguments in opposition. First, Defendants assert that \n15 \n“Plaintiffs waited too long to seek preliminary relief,” which “implies a lack of urgency and \n16 \nirreparable harm.” Dkt. No. 93 at 26–27 (quoting Miller ex rel. N.L.R.B. v. Cal. Pac. Med. Ctr., \n17 \n991 F.2d 536, 544 (9th Cir. 1993)). Second, Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs’ claimed economic \n18 \ninjuries are not irreparable,” because “monetary injury is not normally considered irreparable.” \n19 \nId. at 27 (quoting L.A. Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v. Nat’l Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1202 \n20 \n(9th Cir. 1980)). Third, Defendants argue that the injuries alleged by Plaintiffs “depend[] on an \n21 \nattenuated chain of possibilities.” Id. at 28. Defendants further question the likelihood that these \n22 \n“potential” injuries will actually befall Plaintiffs. Id. at 28–29. \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 53 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 54 of 66\n \n1  a.  Lack of Urgency \n2  The Court rejects Defendants’ contention that Plaintiffs are ineligible for relief here \n3  because they waited 12 weeks after the February 6, 2025, issuance of the Biondi Letter to request \n4  an injunction. See Dkt. No. 93 at 26–27. For one thing, courts are “loath to withhold relief solely \n5  on that ground.” Lydo Enters., Inc. v. City of Las Vegas, 745 F.2d 1211, 1214 (9th Cir. 1984). \n6  For another, Defendants baldly presume that the 12-week period between Defendants’ letter and \n7  Plaintiffs’ motion is, in fact, a “delay.” But is the 12 weeks between the Biondi Letter and \n8  Plaintiffs’ motion the appropriate time period to consider here and, if so, is it really too long? \n9  Defendants do not provide any authority indicating that it is, only a collection of caselaw that \n10  shows courts’ general disfavor of “delays” when considering motions for preliminary injunctive \n11  relief that involved plaintiffs who moved for injunctions years after the challenged action. See id. \n12  at 27.11  \n13  Furthermore, Defendants provide no basis on which to conclude that 12 weeks is, in fact, \n14  properly considered a delay in the first place. Given this hole in Defendants’ argument, the Court \n15  credits Plaintiffs’ explanation of their timeline. First, even though the Biondi Letter issued \n16  February 6, 2025, “the magnitude of the potential harm” from the letter only became apparent \n17  later, on or about March 31, 2025, when FHWA confirmed to California that, “As a result of the \n18  [Biondi Letter] . . . , the NEVI formula program codes have been placed in ‘expired’ status. \n19  Thus, no funds are available for obligation.” Dkt. No. 8 ¶ 11. Thus, “Plaintiffs filed suit—and \n20  immediately sought injunctive relief—only 37 days after FHWA confirmed it had rejected \n21 \n \n22 \n11 Defendants cite Benisek v. Lamone, 585 U.S. 155, 159 (2018) (plaintiffs waited six years prior to moving for \npreliminary injunction); Oakland Tribune, Inc. v. Chronicle Publ’g Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1375, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985) \n23 \n(“many years”); Lydo Enters., 745 F.2d at 1211, 1213 (five years). Further, Defendants cite Arc of California, where \nthe Ninth Circuit found that a three-month period between the passage of a statute and plaintiffs’ moving for a \n24  preliminary injunction was not indicative of a lack of urgency on the plaintiffs’ part. 757 F.3d at 990. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 54 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 55 of 66\n \n1  California’s construction authorization request based on the FHWA Letter.” Dkt. No. 99 at 17. \n2  “Under such circumstances, waiting to file for preliminary relief until a credible case for \n3  irreparable harm can be made is prudent rather than dilatory.” Arc of Cal., 757 F.3d at 991. \n4  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ purported “delay” does not negate a showing of irreparable harm. \n5  The Court turns now to Plaintiffs’ substantive allegations of harm.  \n6  b.  Harm to EV Infrastructure Programs \n7  First, Plaintiffs argue that “Defendants’ actions will cause significant irreparable harm by \n8  arresting Plaintiff States’ programs created to further their sovereign interests in protecting \n9  residents’ welfare, their economies, and the environment.” Dkt. No. 5 at 20. Plaintiffs identify \n10  concrete actions that they have taken “in reliance on [Congressional] support”: “Plaintiff States \n11  developed deployment plans, sought out private partnerships, conducted public outreach, \n12  committed state tax dollars, and hired or redirected existing staff resources to carry out the NEVI \n13  Formula Program.” Id. at 21. Plaintiffs have awarded contracts, signed contracts, and \n14  commenced—or are about to commence—construction on infrastructure projects. Id. Plaintiffs \n15  argue that “Defendants’ actions have halted these processes and threaten to scuttle projects—or \n16  even entire state programs—altogether.” Id. at 22. \n17  In arguing that Plaintiffs’ alleged harms are purely economic, and therefore redressable \n18  with monetary damages, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs “have not established that a temporary \n19  pause on the distribution of NEVI funds threatens the very existence of their projects.” Dkt. \n20  No. 93 at 28. The evidence submitted by Plaintiffs belies this assertion. For example: \n21  •  “As of February 6, 2025, 15 grant awards under the Wisconsin Department of \nTransportation’s first RFP, representing $7.3 million, remain unobligated. \n22  Wisconsin is unable to continue work implementing these grant awards.” Dkt. \nNo. 26 ¶ 19. Wisconsin issued a second RFP in Spring 2025 but “does not have \n23  access to approximately $62.65 million of its remaining apportionment of NEVI \nFormula Program funding and cannot issue awards under the [second] RFP.” Id.  \n24   \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 55 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 56 of 66\n \n1  •  In Rhode Island,  \n2  The suspension of the NEVI Program caused immediate \ndisruption by causing the halt of the open application \n3  period, preventing Rhode Island from awarding funds to \ncommunities and public entities that had already invested \n4  time and resources preparing proposals. It forced the \nclosure of an active grant opportunity that many applicants \n5  had already initiated or completed internal reviews for, \ndelaying project pipelines. In addition, it created \n6  uncertainty for future programming, as staffing resources \nand strategic partnerships had been mobilized under the \n7  assumption of continued funding and plan stability. \n \n8  Dkt. No. 24 ¶ 25.  \n9  •  In California, an awardee of NEVI projects has lost site hosts with whom it “had \nletters of intent or memorandums of understanding,” leaving the awardee with \n10  projects to build but, suddenly, no place to build them and resulting in \n“significant[] delay[s] or abandon[ment].” Dkt. No. 7 ¶ 20; see Dkt. No. 100 ¶ 6. \n11  These are but three instances of harms alleged by Plaintiffs that cannot be rectified by \n12  Defendants simply disbursing funds on an indeterminate date in the future. Nor do they represent \n13  scenarios where Defendants’ as-yet unscheduled resumption of the NEVI Formula Program will \n14  leave Plaintiffs where they were prior to its suspension.  \n15    In AmeriCorps, the court found irreparable harm where the federal government’s funding \n16  freeze “directed an AmeriCorps-funded program to ‘pause all activities.’” AmeriCorps, 2025 WL \n17  1585051, at *34. “[O]rganizations that depend heavily on AmeriCorps funding to deliver \n18  essential services now face an immediate and critical threat to their operations, with many forced \n19  to significantly scale back or, in some cases, cease operations entirely.” Id. (cleaned up). The \n20  cessation or termination of social programs, combined with the loss of personnel who have \n21  developed connections with the communities they serve, will lead to an “erosion of trust”; \n22  relationships “cannot simply be replaced or restarted without significant damage to the progress \n23  made . . . .” Id.  \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 56 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 57 of 66\n \n1    Similarly, the court in Washington v. Trump found “immediate and irreparable injuries” \n2  where a funding freeze threatened “grants that are currently underway.” 768 F. Supp. 3d at 1279. \n3  Indeed, as Plaintiffs here assert, “[e]ven if Defendants eventually return to distributing funds as \n4  required, that will not cure the delay and loss of industry confidence in States’ NEVI \n5  implementation programs.” Dkt. No. 5 at 22. These harms are not, as Defendants insist, \n6  “squarely economic in nature.” Dkt. No. 93 at 28.  \n7  Defendants insisted at oral argument that, because the only action that the IIJA \n8  contemplates is the distribution of money, any harm caused by Defendants’ nondistribution will \n9  be cured when (and if) money begins to flow. See Dkt. No. 109 at 36:11–13. But IIJA does not \n10  merely distribute funds; money appropriated by the statute is apportioned, obligated, and \n11  disbursed to pay for particular things, at particular times, in particular places. As California’s \n12  testimony makes clear, when an EV infrastructure project predicated on NEVI Formula funding \n13  loses that funding—even, as Defendants insist, temporarily—that program runs the risk of dying \n14  on the vine. Where a site host “decided not to enter into final agreements [with the state] once \n15  they learned that NEVI funding was paused” and “instead pursued EV charging partners that \n16  would be able to proceed without NEVI funding,” the project can no longer be built in its \n17  planned location. Dkt. No. 7 ¶ 20. “If the NEVI awardee cannot find a site host, its project will \n18  be significantly delayed or abandoned,” potentially “result[ing] in failure to achieve NEVI \n19  requirements such as NEVI-compliant EV chargers every 50 miles along federally-approved \n20  corridors.” Id. \n21  Consider a hypothetical situation where a government program seeks to encourage \n22  farmers to cultivate a particular crop—say, wheat. In the winter, the government promises to pay \n23  a farmer $1,000 for each acre of wheat under cultivation. Encouraged by the subsidy, a farmer \n24  prepares a field for wheat, purchases fertilizer optimized for wheat cultivation, and contracts to \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 57 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 58 of 66\n \n1  sell the crop to a local miller. But with planting season looming, the government advises that it \n2  has “temporarily paused” the wheat subsidy: The $1,000-per-acre subsidy will not be distributed. \n3  The farmer cannot afford to have a field lie fallow and, therefore, abandons wheat for a different \n4  crop, albeit one not incentivized by a government subsidy—say, corn. The farmer purchases new \n5  fertilizer and seeds, searches for a buyer for the old fertilizer, prepares the land for corn \n6  cultivation, and pleads with the miller to modify the contract from wheat to corn. Then, after all \n7  of this, the government restarts the wheat program and re-offers the subsidy. But even if the \n8  farmer wants to go back to Plan A, it is too late. The farmer has purchased new fertilizer and new \n9  seeds and has lost the contract with the miller. Perhaps most importantly, the field has been \n10  committed to, fertilized, and sown with another crop; it cannot suddenly be switched back to \n11  wheat simply because the government has pulled out its checkbook. So, too, with an EV \n12  charging station originally sited in a prime location, then forced to relocate after its site host pulls \n13  out of its NEVI-funded deal with the state. Just as the farmer cannot plant the wheat in the same \n14  field as the corn, a state cannot have the original site back that has been recommitted to a \n15  different entity. A new location must be found, administrative time and resources expended, and \n16  a new arrangement with a new host worked out. This is not mere economic harm; it affects \n17  “permit[ting] and rights-of-way,” as well as the availability of “subcontractors and/or other \n18  project partners.” Dkt. No. 7 ¶ 21; see Dkt. No. 109 at 13:21–15:5 (describing various examples \n19  of non-economic harm sustained by Plaintiff States); see also AmeriCorps, 2025 WL 1585051, at \n20  *36 (finding irreparable harm where funding freeze forced organizations “to come up with \n21  alternative programs to address gaps left by the withdrawal of funds and programs”). \n22  c.  Increased Administrative Burden \n23  Plaintiffs assert that “[t]he budgetary confusion and uncertainty” caused by Defendants’ \n24  actions constitute further irreparable harm. Dkt. No. 5 at 23. Defendants attack this allegation \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 58 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 59 of 66\n \n1  through a strawman argument, focusing exclusively on the “increased administrative costs” and \n2  “cost increases from delayed construction” that Plaintiffs include underneath the administrative-\n3  burden umbrella. Dkt. No. 93 at 28. The Court conditionally agrees with Defendants that the \n4  decrease in NEVI Formula funding available for actual EV infrastructure—a decrease caused by \n5  Plaintiffs’ being forced to spend NEVI Formula funds on their respective administrative \n6  responses to the funding freeze—is an economic injury that could be addressed through \n7  monetary damages. See Dkt. No. 93 at 28. But the full extent of this injury could only be truly \n8  and fully redressed by the disbursement of funds above and beyond what Congress originally \n9  promised. After all, if a state solicits a request for proposals for an EV infrastructure project, then \n10  withdraws it, then—upon the re-availability of the funds—re-solicits it, the administrative cost \n11  has been doubled without any commensurate increase to the benefit: two solicitations \n12  undertaken, but only one project realized. That is to say, it is unfortunate and wasteful that, if and \n13  when the NEVI Formula Program resumes, Plaintiffs will find themselves with less money for \n14  construction, having been forced to draw down funds by taking actions necessary to respond to \n15  the loss of funds in the first place.  \n16  In identifying their respective injuries further, Plaintiffs also cite “operational harms,” \n17  such as “increased staff time spent fielding industry inquiries, redesigning paused solicitations, \n18  or reconfiguring budgets.” Dkt. No. 5 at 23. Plaintiffs assert further that “the interference with \n19  Plaintiff States’ ability to budget, plan for the future, and properly serve their residents is itself an \n20  intangible, uncompensable harm.” Id. at 24. The Court agrees. The “mitigating steps” that \n21  Plaintiffs have taken in response to the funding freeze—such as Washington’s reassignment of \n22  its full-time NEVI employee and its cancelation of a second NEVI hire—constitute irreparable \n23  harm. County of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 537 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (finding \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 59 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 60 of 66\n \n1  irreparable harm where uncertainty caused by executive action “interfere[d] with [plaintiffs’] \n2  ability to budget, plan for the future, and properly serve their residents”). \n3  Finally, the Court notes Defendants’ disingenuous assertion that Plaintiffs have \n4  “recognize[d] that once Defendants resume NEVI Program fund distribution, their alleged injury \n5  will be ameliorated.” Dkt. No. 93 at 29. Plaintiffs have made no such recognition and have in \n6  fact argued—and demonstrated—quite the opposite through their briefing, oral argument, and \n7  submission of testimony from state transportation officials. See Dkt. No. 109 at 43:10–44:1. It is \n8  telling that Defendants’ opposition brief fails to address a single concrete instance of harm \n9  alleged by any one of the Plaintiffs and instead relies on the categorical argument that all of \n10  Plaintiffs’ alleged harms are economic. Put another way, Defendants do not deny that their \n11  actions have substantially harmed Plaintiffs. Rather, they simply assume that the costs will be the \n12  same and insist that the Court can simply put a price tag on everything and send them a bill. \n13  The Court disagrees and finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently established the likelihood \n14  that they will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief.  \n15  3.  Balance of Equities/Public Interest \n16  When deciding whether to grant an injunction, “courts must balance the competing \n17  claims of injury and must consider the effect of each party of the granting or withholding of the \n18  requested relief.” Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 866 (9th Cir. 2017) \n19  (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 24). The Court must also consider whether granting an injunction is \n20  in the public interest. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. These two factors merge when the federal \n21  government is a party. Roman, 977 F.3d at 940–41. “The rule of law is secured by a strong \n22  public interest that the laws ‘enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by executive \n23  fiat.’” Washington, 768 F. Supp. 3d at 1280 (quoting E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 932 F.3d at \n24  779).  \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 60 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 61 of 66\n \n1  The balance of equities clearly tips in favor of Plaintiffs. In passing the IIJA, Congress \n2  made it the policy of the federal government to spend $5 billion in public funds on the \n3  “acquisition and installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.” 135 Stat. at 1421. This \n4  statute has not been repealed, and thus Plaintiffs’ argument that “[s]o long as Defendants \n5  continue to withhold NEVI funds, Plaintiff States will be unable to proceed with—and the public \n6  will not benefit from—full implementation of their plans to deploy EV charging infrastructure,” \n7  carries substantial weight. Dkt. No. 5 at 26. As demonstrated in their imposition of a \n8  “temporary”—yet indefinite—“pause” on the NEVI Formula Program, Defendants’ ongoing \n9  actions run counter to the expressed will of Congress. Moreover, as discussed above, the Court \n10  agrees that Defendants’ actions have caused, and continue to cause, immediate and irreparable \n11  harm to Plaintiffs.  \n12  For their part, “Defendants do not have a legitimate interest in ensuring that funds are \n13  spent”—or, in this case, not spent—“pursuant to conditions that were likely imposed in violation \n14  of the APA and/or the Constitution.” King County, 2025 WL 1582368, at *20 (citing Valle del \n15  Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013) (there is no legitimate government \n16  interest in violating federal law)). Moreover, the Court is unmoved by Defendants’ argument that \n17  “granting the preliminary injunction that Plaintiffs seek would disrupt Defendants’ efforts to \n18  finalize and promulgate NEVI guidance in accordance with current policies and priorities.” Dkt. \n19  No. 93 at 29. This self-deprecating assertion is unreasonable. After issuing NEVI Formula \n20  Program guidance in 2022, FHWA managed to update it and reissue it in 2023, and again in \n21  2024, without suspending the program altogether. Defendants argue, essentially, that under this \n22  administration, FHWA cannot walk and chew gum at the same time: The only way that the \n23  agency can properly re-examine, then re-issue, the guidance is if it is relieved of its \n24  responsibilities to administer the program. Given that FHWA had no problem doing this \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 61 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 62 of 66\n \n1  simultaneously under the prior administration, and given the inefficiency of such a stop-start \n2  approach to the administration of the agency’s affairs, the Court is confident that the agency can \n3  continue this feat of multitasking under the current administration. \n4  Therefore, the balance of equities and public-interest factors tip in favor of Plaintiffs. \n5  *  *  * \n6  Having considered the applicable factors, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \n7  Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction as follows. \n8  C.

Here, Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin Defendants from: (1) suspending or \n12  revoking approvals of Plaintiff States’ State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans; \n13  (2) improperly withholding or withdrawing—i.e., not in accordance with the IIJA—NEVI \n14  Formula Program funds from Plaintiff States; and (3) “effectuating” a categorical suspension or \n15  termination of the NEVI Formula Program for Plaintiff States. Dkt. No. 5-2 at 2. Plaintiffs do not \n16  seek nationwide relief or to enjoin Defendants from continuing their actions vis-à-vis non-\n17  Plaintiff states. For their part, Defendants do not address the scope of Plaintiffs’ requested \n18  injunction. \n19  It is, however, Plaintiffs’ burden to establish irreparable harm as to all Plaintiffs who seek \n20  injunctive relief. See Allied Concrete & Supply Co. v. Brown, No. C16-4830, 2016 WL 9275783, \n21  at *4 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 18, 2016). Here, three Plaintiffs—the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and \n22  Vermont—did not proffer any evidence—such as a declaration from a state (or District) \n23  official—that demonstrates the irreparable harm that would befall them absent injunctive relief. \n24  Although these three Plaintiffs, like the others, established sufficient injury to satisfy the ripeness \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 62 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 63 of 66\n \n1  requirement, see supra Section IV.A.1, they have not provided any testimony, beyond what is \n2  alleged in the complaint, that demonstrates, say, a delayed or canceled project, a budget thrown \n3  into chaos, or a withdrawn request for proposals. Therefore, these Plaintiffs have not satisfied all \n4  four Winter elements, and the Court cannot grant them the requested relief. \n5  Given that the injunctive relief here will likely be rendered moot once Defendants follow \n6  through on their stated intention to issue new NEVI Formula Program guidance that comports \n7  with the current administration’s policies, and states submit their new state deployment plans, the \n8  Court is not overly concerned that certain Plaintiff States’ deployment plans will for the near-\n9  term future be active, while other states’ deployment plans will remain revoked.12 Presumably, \n10  Defendants will issue new NEVI Formula Program guidance, at which point all states, plus the \n11  District of Columbia, will be required to submit updated State Plans, just as they were required to \n12  do under the former administration. See Dkt. No. 93 at 19.  \n13  D.  Bond Requirement \n14  Defendants argue that, “should the Court be inclined to order any injunctive relief, the \n15  Court should also order Plaintiffs to post security.” Dkt. No. 93 at 30. Under Federal Rule of \n16  Civil Procedure 65(c), “[t]he court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining \n17  order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the \n18  costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” \n19  But “[d]espite the seemingly mandatory language, ‘Rule 65(c) invests the district court with \n20  discretion as to the amount of security required, if any.’” Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, \n21  1086 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Jorgensen v. Cassiday, 320 F.3d 906, 919 (9th Cir. 2003)). In \n22  public-interest litigation where the court enjoins unlawful agency action, a “nominal” bond is \n23 \n \n12 In any event, the Court is not in a position to make any determination as to whether any non-Plaintiff states may \n24  suffer or have suffered immediate or irreparable harm, as that information is not before the Court. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 63 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 64 of 66\n \n1  appropriate, especially where, as here, the government-defendant fails to provide any evidence \n2  that an injunction would impose a substantial cost. Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, 167 F.3d 1228, \n3  1237 (9th Cir. 1999); see U.S. Mission Corp. v. City of Mercer Island, No. C14-1844, 2015 WL \n4  540182, at *9 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 10, 2015) (setting “nominal” bond of $100.00). In \n5  environmental cases, a nominal bond or bond waiver has been found to be appropriate in light of \n6  “the important public interest in the enforcement of [federal environmental law].” \n7  Richland/Wilkin Joint Powers Auth. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 826 F.3d 1030, 1043 (8th Cir. \n8  2016) (collecting cases). In recent cases where courts have enjoined federal-agency defendants, \n9  bonds have been waived altogether. See King County, 2025 WL 1582368, at *20 (denying \n10  enjoined federal-government defendants’ request for bond); AmeriCorps, 2025 WL 1585051, at \n11  *39 (same); California, 2025 WL 1711531, at *4 (waiving bond). \n12  Here, the Court waives the imposition of any bond on Plaintiffs. The harm Defendants \n13  seek to hedge against is “premature disbursement of funds.” Dkt. No. 93 at 30. But given that \n14  Defendants are obligated to distribute these funds under the IIJA to someone, the only harm \n15  attendant to a “premature disbursement” does not redound to Defendants. Rather, at worst, \n16  Defendants might someday, upon complying with the IIJA’s procedural prerequisites for \n17  withdrawing or withholding NEVI Formula funds, potentially divert such withdrawn or withheld \n18  funds to other recipients as prescribed in the statute. The “harm” that Defendants actually \n19  identify, then, is the nondistribution of withdrawn or withheld NEVI Formula funds to alternate \n20  recipients. Such harm is speculative and attenuated and, moreover, only sustained, if at all, by \n21  parties that cannot be identified at this time. In enjoining Defendants, the Court merely \n22  “require[s] Defendants to adhere to the formula fund process contemplated by Congress, while \n23  maintaining FHWA’s normal, proper oversight role prior to any actual obligation or \n24  disbursement.” Dkt. No. 99 at 18 (citing Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION - 64 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 110     Filed 06/24/25     Page 65 of 66\n \n1  2013) (holding that federal government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends \n2  an unlawful practice”)).  \n3  E.  Stay \n4  Defendants request that “if this Court does enter injunctive relief, that [such] relief be \n5  stayed for a period of seven days to allow the Solicitor General to determine whether to appeal \n6  and seek a stay pending appeal.” Dkt. No. 93 at 30–31. Although the Court is mindful that, as \n7  Plaintiffs point out, Defendants’ request is “cursory” (Dkt. No. 99 at 18), seven days is a short \n8  period of time. The Court thus STAYS the injunction for seven (7) days, until July 1, 2025, or \n9  until Defendants appeal this Order to the Ninth Circuit, whichever comes first.  \n10  V.  CONCLUSION \n11  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. No. 5) is GRANTED IN \n12  PART and DENIED IN PART. As to Plaintiffs Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai‘i, \n13  Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, \n14  and Wisconsin, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED. As to Plaintiffs District of Columbia, Minnesota, \n15  and Vermont, Plaintiffs’ motion is DENIED.

President Trump has unleashed an attack on an increasingly popular consumer \n3 \nchoice—the electric vehicle. On Inauguration Day, the President issued an executive order \n4 \nentitled Unleashing American Energy (“Executive Order”), which proclaims it the policy of \n5 \nthe United States to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, \n6 \n90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025). The federal government, however, has never adopted any \n7 \nsuch “EV mandate.” But in the name of eliminating this fictional mandate, the Executive Order \n8 \ndirects the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA” or “Agency”) to usurp the legislative \n9 \nand spending powers reserved to Congress by withholding congressionally appropriated \n10 \nfunding for electric vehicle (“EV”) charging infrastructure required by statute to be distributed \n11 \nto States. \n12 \n2.  Specifically, in a section of the Executive Order entitled “Terminating the \n13 \nGreen New Deal,” the President mandated all federal agencies to “immediately pause the \n14 \ndisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law \n15 \n117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not \n16 \nlimited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National \n17 \nElectric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. \n18 \nat 8357. This, the Executive Branch cannot do. \n19 \n3.  Congress established the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (“NEVI”) \n20 \nFormula Program, through enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), \n21 \nalso known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The IIJA appropriated $5 billion for the \n22 \nexplicit purpose of “providing funding to the States to strategically deploy electric vehicle \n23 \ncharging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected network to facilitate data collection, \n24 \naccess, and reliability.” Pub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, 1421 (2021). Importantly, Congress  \n25 \n/ / / \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 3 of 68\n \n1  required the distribution of this $5 billion among the States1 over fiscal years 2022 through \n2  2026 according to a mandatory formula. Id. at 1422. \n3  4.  The FHWA, although tasked with faithfully administering the NEVI Formula \n4  Program, almost immediately carried out President Trump’s anti-NEVI directive in diametric \n5  opposition to statutory mandate.  \n6  5.  On February 6, 2025, the FHWA notified States via letter (“FHWA Letter”) that \n7  it had taken three actions to categorically and indefinitely “suspend” the NEVI Formula \n8  Program. First, the Agency announced it had rescinded all versions of statutorily required \n9  NEVI Formula Program Guidance. Second—with no advance notice and without reasoned \n10  explanation—the Agency unlawfully revoked all prior approvals of NEVI Formula Program \n11  implementation plans (“State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans” or “State \n12  Plans”), which States are required to submit to access their share of NEVI Formula Program \n13  funds. In fact, the FHWA retroactively and categorically revoked its prior approval of every \n14  State Plan—more than 150 in total—on the sole basis of its recission of the NEVI Formula \n15  Program Guidance.  \n16  6.  Finally, the FHWA informed the States that “no new obligations may occur \n17  under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is \n18  issued and new State [P]lans are submitted and approved.” The FHWA cited no other reasons \n19  for prohibiting new obligations other than its own retroactive revocation of all State Plan \n20  approvals, an action that itself was predicated only on the Agency’s recission of the NEVI \n21  Formula Program Guidance.  \n22  7.  The FHWA’s actions had the effect of withholding or withdrawing from States \n23  NEVI Formula Program funds available to the States for obligation, functionally abrogating \n24  the congressionally mandated NEVI Formula Program by executive fiat.  \n25 \n \n1 For the purposes of this Complaint, the term “States” includes Puerto Rico and the District of \n26 \nColumbia. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 4 of 68\n \n1  8.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants’ \n2  unlawful actions. \n3  9.  Plaintiff States have invested in programs to encourage adoption of EVs as a \n4  means of reducing smog, air toxics, and other harmful pollution from combustion engine \n5  vehicle emissions, which cause grave health problems such as cancer and asthma, and \n6  contributes to the devastating effects of climate change in these States. \n7  10.  The Defendants’ actions impede Plaintiff States’ ability to build the EV \n8  charging infrastructure envisioned under the IIJA and necessary for widespread EV adoption. \n9  This infrastructure is critical to the success of Plaintiff States’ environmental, public health, \n10  and transportation programs—projects Congress actively chose to support in enacting the IIJA \n11  and establishing the NEVI Formula Program. The harms to Plaintiff States will continue and \n12  become increasingly damaging if unabated. \n13  11.  To prevent irreparable injury to Plaintiff States, this Court should declare that \n14  the Defendants’ actions to implement the President’s directive are unlawful under the \n15  Administrative Procedure Act, violate the United States Constitution, and are contrary to the \n16  law, outside the Defendants’ authority, and unlawful under the common law ultra vires \n17  doctrine. Plaintiff States therefore request that this Court vacate the Defendants’ unlawful \n18  actions and preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from, among other things, \n19  implementing or effectuating the directive in the Executive Order to withhold NEVI Formula \n20  Program funds in contravention of the express congressional mandates in the IIJA.  \n21  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22  12.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n23  1346(a)(2). The Court has further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, \n24  28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202. Jurisdiction is also proper under the judicial review provisions \n25  of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 5 of 68\n \n1  13.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and \n2  1391(e)(1). Defendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. \n3  The State of Washington is a resident of this district, and a substantial part of the events or \n4  omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred and continues to occur within the Western \n5  District of Washington.  \n6  PARTIES \n7  14.  Plaintiffs are sovereign states of the United States of America. Plaintiffs bring \n8  this action in their sovereign and proprietary capacities. As set forth below, Defendants’ \n9  actions directly harm Plaintiff States’ interests, including but not limited to financial and \n10  environmental harms that flow from the Defendants’ unlawful actions announced in the \n11  FHWA Letter.  \n12  15.  The State of Washington is represented by and through Attorney General \n13  Nicholas W. Brown, who is the chief legal adviser to the State and is authorized to act in \n14  federal court on behalf of the State on matters of public concern. \n15  16.  The State of Colorado is represented by and through Attorney General Phil \n16  Weiser, who acts as the chief legal representative of the State. \n17  17.  The State of California is represented by and through Attorney General Rob \n18  Bonta, California’s chief law enforcement officer, and by and through Governor Gavin \n19  Newsom, the California Department of Transportation (“Caltrans”), and the California Energy \n20  Commission (“CEC”). Caltrans and CEC jointly administer the implementation of the NEVI \n21  Formula Program in California. \n22  18.  The State of Arizona is represented by Attorney General Kris Mayes, who is the \n23  chief law enforcement officer of Arizona and is authorized to act in federal court on behalf of \n24  the State. \n25  / / / \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 6 of 68\n \n1  19.  The State of Delaware is represented by and through Attorney General Kathleen \n2  Jennings, who is the chief law officer of Delaware and is authorized to bring this action on \n3  behalf of the State.  \n4  20.  The District of Columbia is represented by and through Attorney General Brian \n5  L. Schwalb, who is the chief legal officer of the District of Columbia. \n6  21.  The State of Hawaiʻi is represented by and through Attorney General Anne \n7  Lopez, who is the chief law enforcement officer and chief legal officer of the State. \n8  22.  The State of Illinois is represented by and through Attorney General Kwame \n9  Raoul, who is the chief law enforcement officer of Illinois. \n10  23.  The Office of the Governor of Kentucky, ex rel. Andy Beshear, brings this suit \n11  in his official capacity as Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The Kentucky \n12  Constitution makes the Governor the Chief Magistrate with the “supreme executive power of \n13  the Commonwealth,” Ky. Const. § 69, and gives the Governor, and only the Governor, the \n14  duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” id. § 81; Beshear v. Bevin, 498 S.W.3d \n15  355, 369 (Ky. 2016) (citing Ky. Const. § 81). Under Kentucky statute, the Governor is the head \n16  of his General Cabinet and his Executive Cabinet. Ky. Rev. Stat. §§ 11.060, 11.065. The \n17  Governor’s Executive Cabinet consists of the Secretaries of executive branch cabinets, \n18  including the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. In fulfilling his constitutional duties, the \n19  Governor has authority to bring this action. \n20  24.  The State of Maryland is represented by Attorney General Anthony G.

Congress Established the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula \n16 \nProgram to Fund Strategic Deployment of Electric Vehicle Charging \nInfrastructure \n17 \n18  40.  On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan \n19  Infrastructure Law, enacted as the IIJA. 135 Stat. 429. \n20  41.  The IIJA establishes the NEVI Formula Program. Through the IIJA, Congress \n21  appropriated $5 billion and mandated that those funds “shall be to carry out the [NEVI] \n22  Formula Program” and must “remain available until expended.” Id. at 1421. \n23  NEVI Formula Program funds are “formula” funds. See, e.g., City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 \n24  F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir. 2019). Unlike discretionary funding, formula funds are appropriated by \n25  Congress for a specific purpose and must be distributed on the basis of a statutory formula. The  \n26  / / /  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 9 of 68\n \n1  NEVI Formula Program applies the same federal formula as that which is used to distribute \n2  highway funds. 135 Stat. at 1422.  \n3  42.  The purpose of the NEVI Formula Program is to “provide funding to States to \n4  strategically deploy electric vehicle charging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected \n5  network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability.” Id. at 1421. \n6  43.  More specifically, after setting aside funds for NEVI Formula Program \n7  administration and an additional grant program, NEVI Formula Program funds apportioned to \n8  States “shall be used for: (1) the acquisition and installation of electric vehicle charging \n9  infrastructure to serve as a catalyst for the deployment of such infrastructure and to connect it \n10  to a network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability; (2) proper operation and \n11  maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and (3) data sharing about electric \n12  vehicle charging infrastructure to ensure the long-term success of investments made under [the \n13  NEVI Formula Program provisions of the IIJA].” Id. at. 1421-22; see also id. at 1425 \n14  (discussing set-asides). \n15  44.  The NEVI Formula Program first prioritizes building out “alternative fuel \n16  corridor[s]” with EV charging infrastructure along the national highway system to support \n17  long-distance travel and increase driver confidence in charging port availability during intra- \n18  and interstate travel. Id. at 1423-24. Focusing first on this national network of alternative fuel \n19  corridors (“AFCs”) helps ensure that drivers beyond urban commuter areas have the option to \n20  choose an EV. \n21  45.  Distribution of NEVI Formula Program funds is not discretionary: The \n22  Secretary of Transportation (“Secretary”) “shall distribute among the States the [NEVI \n23  Formula Program funds] so that each State receives” the amount determined by the formula. \n24  Id. at 1422 (emphasis added). Indeed, as explained below, even in the limited circumstances a \n25  State may become ineligible to receive its share of NEVI Formula Program funds for a \n26  particular fiscal year, the IIJA requires the Secretary to distribute all lawfully withheld or \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 10 of 68\n \n1  withdrawn funds to local jurisdictions within that State, or to other States, for the \n2  congressionally mandated purpose of building out EV charging infrastructure. See id. at 1422-\n3  23. \n4  46.  Congress established a single prerequisite for a State to receive its share of the \n5  NEVI Formula Program funding appropriated by Congress: Each State must submit a State \n6  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan, by a deadline established by the Secretary, \n7  describing how it “intends to use funds distributed to the State . . . to carry out the [NEVI \n8  Formula] Program for each fiscal year in which funds are made available.” Id. at. 1422. \n9  47.  The IIJA further requires the Secretary, within 90 days of the statute’s \n10  enactment, and in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, to develop “guidance for States \n11  and localities to strategically deploy electric vehicle charging infrastructure” consistent with \n12  the NEVI Formula Program provisions of the IIJA (“NEVI Formula Program Guidance”). Id. \n13  at 1423. \n14  48.  The FHWA issued NEVI Formula Program Guidance on February 10, 2022, \n15  and has updated the guidance annually. The FHWA issued the most recent update on June 11, \n16  2024. \n17  B.  Process to Distribute Nondiscretionary NEVI Formula Program Funds to States \n49.  NEVI Formula Program funds are distributed in accordance with a well-defined \n18 \nprocess. The first step in this process was the congressional appropriation, which authorized \n19 \nthe FHWA to incur financial obligations that will result in immediate or future disbursements \n20 \nof funds from the U.S. Treasury. See 2 U.S.C. § 622(2)(A)(i). In the IIJA, Congress \n21 \nappropriated $5 billion, “to remain available until expended,” to carry out the NEVI Formula \n22 \nProgram in accordance with specific directives and subject to express constraints. 135 Stat. at \n23 \n1421. \n24 \n50.  Next, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), which administers \n25 \nthe federal budget, apportioned the funds appropriated by Congress by dividing the $5 billion \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   9  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 11 of 68\n \n1  appropriation across five fiscal years and distributed the funds to the FHWA. See U.S. Gov’t \n2  Accountability Off., GAO-05-734SP, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget \n3  Process, at 12-13 (Sept. 2005) (“Budget Glossary”).2 The FHWA, which is within the U.S. \n4  Department of Transportation (“U.S. DOT”), annually certifies a further apportionment. This \n5  further apportionment includes setting aside the funds for NEVI Formula Program \n6  administration of the and an additional grant program. The FHWA then divides the remaining \n7  funds for that fiscal year among the States according to the non-discretionary statutory \n8  formula.  \n9  51.  The IIJA’s formula explicitly requires the Secretary to apportion NEVI Formula \n10  Program funds among the States, such that each receives a share of funding proportional to the \n11  combined amount that the FHWA distributes in Federal-aid highway apportionments.3, 4 135 \n12  Stat. at 1422 (citing 23 U.S.C. § 104(c) and § 165). Those amounts are fixed in statute based \n13  on historical apportionments and congressionally determined shares, 23 U.S.C. §§ 104(c), 165. \n14  Neither the Secretary nor the FHWA, nor any other part of the Executive Branch has discretion \n15  to determine the amount of funding apportioned to any State under the NEVI Formula \n16  Program.  \n17  52.  After reviewing each State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n18  submitted, the FHWA notifies each State by letter that its funds for the fiscal year(s) covered \n19  by the Plan are “available for obligation.”5  \n20  53.  An obligation is a “definite commitment that creates a legal liability of the \n21  government for the payment of goods and services ordered or received, or a legal duty on the \n22   \n2 Available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf. \n23  3 Puerto Rico’s share is equal to the amount the FHWA distributes in Puerto Rico Highway Program \nfunding. \n24  4 See, e.g., FHWA, Notice: Apportionment of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Highway Infrastructure Program \nFunds for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment \nand Jobs Act (Feb. 10, 2022), a true and accurate copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n25 \n5 See, e.g., FHWA Letter to Washington State, Approval of Washington State Electric Vehicle \nInfrastructure Deployment Plan (September 14, 2022), a true and accurate copy of which is attached hereto as \n26 \nExhibit B. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   10  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 12 of 68\n \n1  part of the United States that could mature into” such a liability; an “expenditure,” also known \n2  as a “disbursement,” is the actual spending of federal funds. Budget Glossary at 45, 48, 70.  \n3  54.  States obligate their share of apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds by \n4  submitting to the FHWA an authorization request for specific activities. So long as the \n5  activities for which a State requests authorization meet the minimum standards and \n6  requirements to be funded by NEVI Formula Program funds, see 23 C.F.R. Part 680, the \n7  FHWA must approve State’s requests for authorization. Upon FHWA authorization, NEVI \n8  Formula Program funds are obligated for those activities. When the State submits to the \n9  FHWA expenses incurred for those activities, it can draw down the obligated funds, which are \n10  then disbursed into State accounts. The FHWA’s authority to withhold or withdraw those \n11  funds is tightly conscribed by the IIJA. \n12  55.  By way of analogy, the amounts made “available for obligation” are like the \n13  credit limit on a credit card; the obligation is the swipe of the credit card at a point-of-sale \n14  device; and the disbursement is the transfer of funds to pay the bill. \n15  C.  Congress Expressly Prescribed the Circumstances and Procedures Under Which \nthe Federal Highway Administration is Authorized to Withhold or Withdraw \n16  NEVI Formula Program Funds from States \n56.  Congress expressly limited the Secretary’s discretion to withhold or withdraw \n17 \nNEVI Formula Program funds from States. The Secretary must distribute to each State its \n18 \nshare of NEVI Formula Program funds unless the State fails to timely submit its State Electric \n19 \nVehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan or if the Secretary “determines a State has not taken \n20 \naction to carry out its [State P]lan.” 135 Stat. at 1422. \n21 \n57.  In addition to clear substantive parameters, Congress imposed strict procedural \n22 \nrequirements the Secretary must follow: “[P]rior to the Secretary making a determination that a \n23 \nState has not taken actions to carry out its plan, the Secretary shall notify the State, consult \n24 \nwith the State, and identify actions that can be taken to rectify concerns, and provide at least 90 \n25 \ndays for the State to rectify concerns and take action to carry out its [State P]lan.” Id. Then, if \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   11  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 13 of 68\n \n1  the Secretary still makes a determination that the State has not taken actions to carry out its \n2  State Plan, the Secretary must give additional notice and an opportunity to be heard before \n3  withholding or withdrawing any funds: “The Secretary shall provide notice to a State on the \n4  intent to withhold or withdraw funds not less than 60 days before withholding or withdrawing \n5  any funds, during which time the State[] shall have an opportunity to appeal a decision to \n6  withhold or withdraw funds directly to the Secretary.” Id. \n7  58.  To further cement that NEVI Formula Program funds must be distributed for the \n8  purpose of building EV charging infrastructure, the IIJA expressly mandates that the Secretary \n9  redistribute all funds lawfully withheld or withdrawn from a State in a given fiscal year to \n10  other jurisdictions. To redistribute withheld or withdrawn funds, the Secretary may “award \n11  such funds on a competitive basis to local jurisdictions within the State for use on projects that \n12  meet the eligibility requirements.” Id. If the Secretary cannot fully award these funds to local \n13  jurisdictions within the State, “any such funds remaining shall be distributed among other \n14  States . . . in the same manner as funds distributed for that fiscal year.” Id. at 1422-23 \n15  (emphasis added). Whatever the scenario, the NEVI Formula Program funds appropriated by \n16  Congress must always be distributed to support State or local government EV charging \n17  infrastructure projects. \n18  59.  Congress did not give the Secretary authority to suspend or revoke its approval \n19  of State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans and certainly did not authorize the \n20  FHWA to suspend or revoke approval of every State Plan categorically. If a State submits a \n21  Plan by the deadline, the FHWA must provide that State with its share of NEVI Formula \n22  Program funds for the fiscal year(s) covered by that Plan unless the State fails to take action to \n23  carry out the Plan and the Secretary follows the required statutory procedures, including but \n24  not limited to notice and an opportunity to appeal prior to any redistribution of the funds.  \n25  / / /  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   12  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 14 of 68\n \n1  D.

The FHWA approved the States’ Plans \n7  making their shares of NEVI Formula Program funds available to the States for obligation.  \n8  61.  In total, as of February 6, 2025, the FHWA made $3.27 billion available for \n9  obligation for fiscal years 2022 through 2025, including approximately $1.1 billion made \n10  available for obligation to Plaintiff States.6 \n11  62.

The Unleashing American Energy Executive Order  \n2  107.  On January 20, 2025, the President issued an executive order entitled \n3  Unleashing American Energy. Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353.  \n4  108.  In the Executive Order, the President declared it “the policy of the United States \n5  to ‘eliminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate’ and promote true consumer choice, which is \n6  essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor \n7  vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by \n8  terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-\n9  powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-\n10  conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and \n11  effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities \n12  alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable.” Id.  \n13  109.  To “[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal,” and effectuate his own policy priorities, \n14  including the “eliminat[ion of] the electric vehicle (EV) mandate,” the President ordered all \n15  agencies to “immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through . . . [IIJA], \n16  including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through \n17  the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program.” Id. at 8357.  \n18  110.  The President further directed all agencies to “review their processes, policies, \n19  and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such \n20  appropriated funds for consistency with the law and [the President’s energy policy priorities] \n21  outlined in section 2 of the [Executive Order].” Id. \n22  111.  The President also ordered agency heads to submit to the Directors of OMB and \n23  the National Economic Council (“NEC”) a report detailing the agencies’ review, including \n24  “recommendations to enhance their alignment with [the President’s energy policy priorities] \n25  set forth in section 2.” The President made clear that agencies were not to disburse any funds \n26  appropriated under the IIJA “until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   21  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 23 of 68\n \n1  Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review \n2  recommendations they have chosen to adopt.” Id.  \n3  112.  In short, the President directed agencies to withhold congressionally \n4  appropriated funds, including NEVI Formula Program funds, as a tool to terminate programs \n5  the President dislikes.  \n6  113.  But agencies have no authority to rescind or revise statutes, or to withhold funds \n7  duly appropriated by Congress based on the President’s disagreement with the policies and \n8  priorities of Congress.  \n9  114.  Indeed, several federal district courts have already enjoined agency actions \n10  effectuating the President’s directive to withhold IIJA and IRA funds as ultra vires, contrary to \n11  law, and arbitrary and capricious. See State of New York v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00039-JJM-\n12  PAS, ECF No. 161 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025) (granting preliminary injunction against categorical \n13  freezes of obligated funds); Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., \n14  No. 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS, ECF No. 45 (D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025) (same); Nat’l Council of \n15  Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. and Budget, No. 1:25-cv-00239-LLA, ECF No. 51 (D.D.C. Feb. \n16  25, 2025). \n17  F.  The Federal Highway Administration Implemented the President’s Directive by \nRetroactively and Unlawfully Revoking All State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n18  Deployment Plan Approvals \n19  115.  Consistent with the President’s directive to illegally withhold all IIJA funding, \n20  including NEVI Formula Program funds, on February 6, 2025, the FHWA informed States that \n21  the current NEVI Formula Program Guidance and all prior versions were rescinded. A true and \n22  accurate copy of the FHWA Letter is attached hereto as Exhibit D.  \n23  116.  The FHWA gave no rationale for rescinding the NEVI Formula Program \n24  Guidance, other than stating that the “new leadership” at the U.S. DOT had “decided to review \n25  the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program.” \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   22  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 24 of 68\n \n1  117.  The FHWA Letter further stated that the “FHWA is updating the NEVI Formula \n2  Program Guidance to align with current U.S. DOT policy and priorities, including those set \n3  forth in DOT Order 2100.7.” A true and accurate copy of DOT Order 2100.7 is attached hereto \n4  as Exhibit E. \n5  118.  Unlike the factors Congress enumerated in the IIJA to inform the Secretary’s \n6  development of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, such as “the distance between publicly \n7  available electric vehicle charging infrastructure,” “connections to the electric grid,” and \n8  “long-term operation and maintenance,” 135 Stat. at 1423, DOT Order 2100.7 requires the \n9  U.S. DOT—and therefore the FHWA—to, for example, “prioritize projects and goals \n10  that . . . give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national \n11  average . . . .” \n12  119.  In the FHWA Letter, the FHWA suggests that it “aims to have [an] updated \n13  draft NEVI Formula Guidance published for public comment in the spring.” The Agency states \n14  it will, at some unknown date, after the close of a public comment period of unknown length \n15  “publish updated final NEVI Formula Guidance that responds to comments received.”  \n16  120.  Without citing any legal authority, the FHWA further explains that “[a]s a result \n17  of the rescission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, [the] FHWA is also immediately \n18  suspending the approval of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment [P]lans for all \n19  fiscal years. Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI \n20  Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new \n21  State [P]lans are submitted and approved.” \n22  121.  By announcing that the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance—if it \n23  ever comes—will include “[i]nstructions for the submission of new State [P]lans for all fiscal \n24  years,” the FHWA made clear it has no intention of reapproving any previously approved plan. \n25  The FHWA’s so-called “suspension” is therefore a revocation of all prior State Plan approvals. \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 25 of 68\n \n1  122.  The FHWA’s actions are consistent with multiple executive orders that \n2  demonstrate that this Administration’s policy goals conflict with the NEVI Formula Program \n3  itself, and the recission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance represents mere pretext for \n4  the FHWA’s real objective—implementing the President’s directive to illegally withhold \n5  NEVI Formula Program funds. \n6  123.  In the Executive Order, the President declared it the policy of the United States \n7  to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate,” including, in the words of the order, any \n8  “unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor \n9  EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, \n10  90 Fed. Reg. at 8353. The President’s explicit directive to withhold funds “for electric vehicle \n11  charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula \n12  Program” indicates he considers federal assistance for the construction of EV charging \n13  infrastructure—despite that being Congress’s express objective—to represent one such \n14  “market distortion.” The President’s anti-EV pronouncements likewise include his declaration \n15  of an unfounded national “energy emergency,” announcing the Administration’s focus on \n16  prioritizing and maximizing the nation’s use of fossil fuels, Exec. Order No. 14,156, 90 Fed. \n17  Reg. 8433 (Jan. 29, 2025), and his denouncement of state policies that “burden[]” the “use” of \n18  domestic oil resources in the Protecting American Energy from State Overreach executive \n19  order, Exec. Order No. 14,260, 90 Fed. Reg 15513 (Apr 14, 2025). \n20  124.  The President directed the FHWA to unlawfully withhold funds for “electric \n21  vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n22  Formula Program.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357. The FHWA lacks authority \n23  under the IIJA to withhold NEVI Formula Program funds from States except in the exclusive \n24  circumstances expressly set forth by Congress in the IIJA. It thus contrived a way to implement \n25  the President’s directive—in direct conflict with the statute and without lawful and reasoned \n26  explanation for its actions.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   24  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 26 of 68\n \n1  G.  Unlawfully Revoking All State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \nApproval Harms Plaintiff States \n2 \n3  125.  The FHWA’s retroactive and unlawful revocation of all State Electric Vehicle \n4  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and illegal withholding or withdrawing of statutorily \n5  appropriated and apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds “made available to [a State] for \n6  obligation” has harmed and will continue to harm Plaintiff States and their residents in myriad \n7  ways.  \n8  126.  In total, the FHWA is withholding approximately $2.74 billion of the $3.27 \n9  million in NEVI Formula Program funds available to the States for obligation for fiscal years \n10  2022 through 2025. Collectively, Plaintiff States have been immediately and indefinitely \n11  deprived of access to approximately $1 billion in available NEVI Formula Program funds for \n12  those four fiscal years. \n13  Washington \n14  127.  Washington, through the WSDOT, was apportioned under the NEVI Formula \n15  an approximate total of $71 million in funds over five years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI \n16  Formula Program. Washington’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 \n17  through 2025 (approximately $55 million) were made available to Washington to obligate \n18  upon FHWA approval of Washington’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \n19  covering those fiscal years.  \n20  128.  Washington is a national leader in electric vehicles, remaining in the top five for \n21  EV adoption for more than a decade. The State has proactively invested in EV charging \n22  infrastructure for many years to reduce the environmental effects of the transportation sector. \n23  129.  Transportation is the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington, \n24  contributing approximately twenty-two percent (22%) of total air pollution and thirty-nine \n25  percent (39%) of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions throughout the State.

To help combat climate change and protect the health and welfare of its \n4  residents, Washington has adopted zero-emission vehicle standards that require a percentage of \n5  the vehicles sold in Washington to be zero emissions, starting with the 2025 model year. The \n6  State has also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards, which increases zero \n7  emissions vehicle sales of passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles to one-\n8  hundred percent (100%) by 2035. \n9  131.  In response to the FHWA’s unlawful revocation of its State Electric Vehicle \n10  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and its unlawful withholding of NEVI Formula \n11  Program funds to implement the President’s directive, Washington was forced to cease work \n12  related to the NEVI Formula Program.  \n13  132.  In October 2024, WSDOT issued a notice of funding opportunity (“NOFO”) \n14  and request for proposals (“RFP”) for up to $25 million in projects funded through the NEVI \n15  Formula Program for EV charging infrastructure along five key corridors (I-90, US-97, US-2, \n16  US-195, and US-395). The NOFO/RFP closed on January 31, 2025. WSDOT received 40 \n17  proposals but because Washington does not have funds to cover these projects in the absence \n18  of its share of the NEVI Formula Program funding, the State has not been able to select a \n19  single awardee.  \n20  133.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, the State of Washington has been \n21  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $55 million if its available \n22  NEVI Formula Program funds that Congress expressly directed toward to the State to build out \n23  its EV charging infrastructure. All current and future NEVI Formula Program NOFOs, RFPs, \n24  and all proposed EV charging infrastructure projects in Washington are therefore on hold \n25  indefinitely. The FHWA’s unlawful actions thus create costly delays in project implementation  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   26  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 28 of 68\n \n1  and erode industry confidence in Washington’s ability to fund EV charging infrastructure \n2  projects, which will hamper the State’s ability to find project partners in the future.  \n3  134.  The FHWA’s unlawful actions to revoke Washington’s State Electric Vehicle \n4  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and withhold the State’s share of available NEVI \n5  Formula Program funds significantly impede Washington’s ability to develop a statewide \n6  network of EV charging infrastructure. Widespread, publicly accessible, and reliable EV \n7  charging infrastructure is critical to promote EV adoption and ensure the success of \n8  Washington’s clean car programs, which aim to improve air quality and combat climate change \n9  to protect the health and the welfare of its residents. \n10  California \n11  135.  California, through Caltrans, was apportioned a total of approximately $384 \n12  million in funds over five fiscal years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. \n13  California’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 \n14  (approximately $302 million) was made available to California to obligate upon the FHWA’s \n15  approval of California’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those \n16  fiscal years. \n17  136.  Caltrans and CEC jointly implement the State’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n18  Deployment Plans to support California’s environmental, public health, and transportation \n19  policies. California’s efforts to promote the widespread adoption of zero-emitting EVs are \n20  critical to its Climate Change Scoping Plan, developed to meet the California Legislature’s \n21  GHG reduction targets, and its attainment of federal ambient air quality standards, which \n22  require significant measures to reduce smog precursors like nitrogen oxides and particulate \n23  matter. Failure to attain and maintain these ambient concentrations not only increases the \n24  public health risks, including cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, it also risks \n25  noncompliance penalties to the State, including the loss of highway funds. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7409, \n26  7410, 7509(b); 89 Fed.

Reg. 17,226, 17,232-46 (Apr. 18, 2018) (health effects of nitrogen \n2  oxides). \n3  137.  Under California’s Assembly Bill 118, which created the Clean Transportation \n4  Program administered by CEC, CEC prepares an annual Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure \n5  Plan setting forth the State’s goals for the charging and fueling infrastructure for zero-emission \n6  vehicles (including EVs) that will support the State’s climate and air pollution policies, and \n7  CEC’s strategies for building out that infrastructure. In the 2024 Zero-Emission Vehicle \n8  Infrastructure Plan, CEC projected 7.1 million plug-in passenger EVs in California in 2030 and \n9  15.2 million in 2035.  \n10  138.  The EV charging infrastructure needed to support California drivers is \n11  significant. Fast charging is particularly important along long-distance travel corridors, where \n12  drivers place a premium on quickly recharging their vehicles for the next leg of their journey. \n13  California’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans and its Zero-Emission \n14  Vehicle Infrastructure Plans thus focus NEVI Formula Program funds on building out a \n15  statewide network of fast charging ports along major travel corridors. CEC estimates that \n16  NEVI Formula Program funds will support the deployment of roughly 7,500 charging ports by \n17  2030.  \n18  139.  These fast charging ports serve a demand for EV charging infrastructure that \n19  would otherwise have to be met by a substantially larger number of slower Level 2 charging \n20  ports. A 2023 modeling analysis showed that if California builds out 63,000 additional fast \n21  charging ports, 400,000 fewer Level 2 charging ports are needed to meet the State’s EV \n22  demand by 2030. Without its share of NEVI Formula Program funds, the success of \n23  California’s zero-emission transportation policies will be seriously impeded, and California \n24  will be forced to identify other, less cost-effective funding sources. \n25  140.  In October 2023, CEC opened its first solicitation for NEVI Formula Program \n26  funded projects in California. That first solicitation closed in September 2024 with awards \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   28  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 30 of 68\n \n1  totaling $36.6 million to fund projects along the State’s busiest transportation corridors. Most \n2  of the awards from that solicitation have been finalized in award agreements executed between \n3  CEC and the awardees. A second solicitation closed in March 2025, and application evaluation \n4  is underway. A third round of solicitation is slated to open later this year. \n5  141.  EV charging infrastructure projects funded through the NEVI Formula Program \n6  in California generally proceed in three phases: “preliminary engineering,” “right of way,” and \n7  “construction.” Several California awardees from the first NEVI Formula Program solicitation \n8  are ready to move into their construction phases; others are proceeding with environmental \n9  reviews and obtaining necessary rights of way. These awardees have expressed concern to \n10  Caltrans and CEC that the actions announced in the FHWA Letter will prevent them from \n11  being reimbursed for their costs, and they have therefore delayed proceeding with construction. \n12  142.  One awardee has requested to withdraw its project because the FHWA is \n13  withholding NEVI Formula Program funding. If the awardee withdraws, the charging project it \n14  proposed will be delayed significantly, if not abandoned altogether. \n15  143.  Another awardee reported to CEC that it had letters of intent or memoranda of \n16  understanding with several site hosts—i.e., locations where the awardee could build a charging \n17  station—but those site hosts decided not to enter into site host agreements once they learned \n18  the FHWA was withholding California’s NEVI Formula Program funds. This too will result in \n19  the delay or possible failure of that project. \n20  144.  The withholding of NEVI Formula Program funds threatens the successful \n21  execution of grant agreements with the awardees of California’s second solicitation and will \n22  likely result in potential applicants declining to participate in the third solicitation at all. \n23  145.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful revocation of State Electric Vehicle \n24  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and illegal withholding of NEVI Formula Program \n25  funds, California has been immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   29  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 31 of 68\n \n1  $300 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds that Congress expressly directed \n2  toward to the State to build out its EV charging infrastructure. \n3  146.  The FHWA confirmed the effect of its action in denying Caltrans’s request to \n4  obligate funds for construction of a charging station in San Diego. In an email dated March 31, \n5  2025, the FHWA notified Caltrans that “[a]s a result of the February 6[th] [NEVI Notice],” “no \n6  funds are available for obligation.” A true and accurate copy of this email is attached hereto as \n7  Exhibit F. \n8  Colorado \n9  147.  Colorado, through CDOT, was apportioned approximately $57 million in funds \n10  over five years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. Colorado’s annual shares \n11  of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 were made available to \n12  Colorado to obligate upon FHWA approval of Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n13  Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. CEO has contracted with CDOT to implement \n14  projects for the first four fiscal years of apportioned funding, representing approximately $44.5 \n15  million. \n16  148.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s approval of its Plans, which, consistent with \n17  the IIJA, NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the FHWA’s representations, made NEVI \n18  Formula Program funds available for obligation until expended, Colorado has awarded \n19  approximately $33 million for approved projects. It has contractual obligations with awardees \n20  for $18 million. However, the FHWA has only distributed $8 million in NEVI Formula \n21  Program funds to Colorado. The FHWA is now unlawfully and indefinitely withholding \n22  Colorado’s remaining NEVI Program Formula funds on the basis of its illegal revocation of \n23  Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals. \n24  149.  Colorado has long supported the deployment of EVs and other zero-emission \n25  vehicles (ZEVs) across multiple vehicle classes as a means of reducing the environmental \n26  effects of the transportation sector and achieving its State GHG reduction targets. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   30  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 32 of 68\n \n1  150.  Widespread EV adoption is limited by the availability of publicly accessible EV \n2  charging ports. As a result, Colorado State agencies, local governments, nonprofits, and the \n3  private sector have been collaborating to fund, construct, and operate more than 1,500 Level 2 \n4  and fast charging ports across the State over the past decade. Colorado intended to utilize the \n5  additional funding appropriated by Congress and apportioned to the States under the NEVI \n6  Formula Program to deploy EV charging infrastructure in the gaps remaining in its charging \n7  station network, including in rural and other underserved communities. Colorado also intended \n8  to upgrade existing charging ports in need of greater capacity and address the growing demand \n9  for charging in parts of the State that already see higher EV adoption and usage. Finally, \n10  Colorado expected to use its share of NEVI Formula Program funding to help lay the \n11  groundwork for future charging projects focused on medium- and heavy-duty commercial \n12  users. \n13  151.  The FHWA’s unlawful actions to revoke Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle \n14  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and its unlawful withholding of NEVI Formula \n15  Program funds significantly impedes Colorado’s ability to develop a statewide network of EV \n16  charging stations. Such a network is necessary to promote EV adoption as required by \n17  Colorado’s legislature and executive branch, which have enacted ambitious emissions \n18  reduction goals for the transportation sector. The FHWA’s unlawful actions interfere with \n19  existing projects, and sow uncertainty that undermines confidence in Colorado’s ability to fund \n20  EV charging infrastructure projects and creates costly delays in project implementation.   \n21  Arizona \n22  152.  Arizona, through ADOT, was apportioned an approximate total of $76 million \n23  over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. Arizona’s shares of \n24  NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $60 million) \n25  were made available to Arizona to obligate upon FHWA’s approval of Arizona’s State Electric \n26  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   31  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 33 of 68\n \n1  153.  Transportation was the single largest contributing factor to GHG emissions in \n2  Arizona in 2021. As a result, Arizona has prioritized public fleet electrification and developing \n3  publicly available EV charging infrastructure. These two initiatives are estimated to reduce \n4  cumulative GHG emissions by almost 3 million metric tons between 2025 and 2050. Funding \n5  from the NEVI Formula Program is critical to achieving these emission-reduction goals. \n6  154.  On January 19, 2025, ADOT issued a solicitation for 35 prospective EV \n7  charging station locations identified in its 2023 and 2024 State Plans. ADOT spent a \n8  significant amount of funds and staff time preparing this solicitation, which it had to cancel \n9  after the FHWA announced its unlawful actions.  \n10  155.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Arizona has been immediately and \n11  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $48 million of its available NEVI Formula \n12  Program funds. \n13  District of Columbia \n14  156.  The District of Columbia, through DDOT, was apportioned approximately \n15  $16.7 million over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. The \n16  District’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 \n17  (approximately $13 million) were made available to the District to obligate upon FHWA’s \n18  approval of the District’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those \n19  fiscal years.  \n20  157.  The District acted in reliance on the FHWA complying with the IIJA to obligate \n21  and disburse the District’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds to build a robust, reliable, \n22  and interconnected charging network across all eight District Wards to promote EV adoption.  \n23  158.  Specifically, DDOT planned to build out a reliable network of NEVI Formula \n24  Program compliant fast charging stations, to install at least one fast charging station in each \n25  Ward, and to have a robust stakeholder and public engagement to help identify additional \n26  regional priorities and how best to use any remaining NEVI Formula Program funds.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 34 of 68\n \n1  159.  As a direct result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, the District has been \n2  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $9.5 million of its available \n3  NEVI Formula Program funds, and its ability to develop a District-wide network of EV \n4  charging stations and help support develop a local workforce with experience in EV charging \n5  infrastructure installation, maintenance, and repair has been significantly impeded. \n6  Delaware \n7  160.  The transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in Delaware. \n8  One of the commitments of Delaware’s Climate Action Plan is to minimize transportation \n9  related emissions and transition to vehicles reliant on clean and renewable energy. This goal, \n10  along with federal investment in EVs and their charging stations, will increase Delaware’s \n11  resiliency to the damaging environmental effects of climate change, reduce harmful emissions, \n12  and create a network of accessible EV charging infrastructure that is accessible to everyone in \n13  the State. \n14  161.  Delaware’s General Assembly has enacted statutory provisions for sharing State \n15  vehicle charging infrastructure, 29 Del. C. Section 8062, an electric vehicle rebate program, \n16  Section 8064, and incentives to residential users to install chargers, Section 8065.  \n17  162.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Delaware has been immediately \n18  and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $3.8 million of its available NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds and its ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations \n20  has been seriously impeded. \n21  Hawaiʻi \n22  163.  Hawaiʻi, through Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation, (“HDOT”), was \n23  apportioned approximately $18 million over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula \n24  Program’s goals.  \n25  164.  Hawai‘i has long been a leader in EV adoption, which is essential to reducing \n26  GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. For example, charging sessions at the \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   33  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 35 of 68\n \n1  Kahului station and Aloha Tower station—built using NEVI Formula Program funds—\n2  providing approximately 806,912 kWh roughly translates to a reduction of nearly 528,000 \n3  kilograms of GHGs omitted into the atmosphere. That amount of GHG emission reduction is \n4  equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 14,600 trees.  \n5  165.  Hawaiʻi relies on the NEVI Formula Program funds apportioned to the State to \n6  help transition to a sustainable transportation future and meet the State’s renewable energy \n7  goals by increasing availability of fast, affordable, and dependable EV charging.  \n8  166.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Hawaiʻi has been immediately and \n9  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $2 million of its available NEVI Formula \n10  Program funds and its ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations has been \n11  significantly impeded. \n12  Illinois \n13  167.  Illinois’s State Plans detail the State’s approach to expending its total share of \n14  the NEVI Formula Program funds to build out an EV charging network in service of the State’s \n15  goal of one million EVs on the road by 2030. 20 ILCS 627/45(a)(1). \n16  168.  Through IDOT, Illinois has contractual obligations for $25.4 million for \n17  approved NEVI Formula Program funded projects. IDOT is currently evaluating applications \n18  from a NOFO that closed on January 31, 2025, and intends to award up to $24 million to \n19  complete build out of EV charging infrastructure along Illinois’s AFCs. Additionally, IDOT is \n20  in final negotiations with a consultant to assist with construction oversight of awarded and \n21  obligated NEVI Formula Program funded projects. To pay for these consultant services and \n22  proceed with EV charging infrastructure projects, IDOT will need to obligate additional NEVI \n23  Formula Program funds, which the FHWA is unlawfully withholding. \n24  169.  Consistent with the IIJA and the FHWA’s representations, IDOT has acted in \n25  reliance on NEVI Formula Program funding to cover contractual obligations related to EV \n26  charging infrastructure projects. Illinois does not have funds to cover these projects in the \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   34  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 36 of 68\n \n1  absence of its share of the NEVI Formula Program funding. To date, the FHWA has not \n2  distributed any NEVI Formula Program funds to IDOT. \n3  Kentucky \n4  170.  Kentucky, through KYTC, was apportioned approximately $69 million over \n5  five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. Kentucky’s share of NEVI \n6  Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $55 million) were \n7  made available to Kentucky to obligate upon FHWA approval of Kentucky’s State Electric \n8  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. \n9  171.  Kentucky’s implementation of its State Plans through KYTC consisted of \n10  competitive processes to identify and select qualified Developer Teams to design, build, \n11  operate, and maintain EV charging stations across the state along AFCs to build out a reliable \n12  functioning EV charging network. By way of FHWA-approved Requests for Proposals, KYTC \n13  received hundreds of proposals and has active contracts with Developer Teams for 47 EV \n14  charging station sites totaling $32,189,011. An additional Request for Proposals intended to \n15  complete the NEVI-required “build-out” of the AFC was scheduled to be released in February \n16  2025. \n17  172.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Kentucky has been immediately \n18  and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $18 million of its available NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds, and its ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations \n20  has been significantly impeded. \n21  173.  The illegal withholding of these funds has rendered Kentucky unable to obligate \n22  the necessary funding to administer and oversee its active contracts. Already obligated funding \n23  cannot be adjusted to include Construction Engineering and Inspection costs due to FHWA’s \n24  restriction on obligations, hindering KYTC’s ability to effectively manage the EV charging \n25  stations’ development and operations. The revocation of the remaining apportioned funding \n26  risks interruption of all construction activities and/or operations of these EV charging stations. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   35  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 37 of 68\n \n1  Maryland \n2  174.  In 2020, transportation was the source of over one third of Maryland’s GHG \n3  emissions and a significant source of the air pollutants that form smog. Maryland is committed \n4  to increasing registrations of EVs to address these pollution issues and the State has seen \n5  tremendous growth in the number of registered EVs over the past five years from 14,930 EVs \n6  in 2020 to 132,973 EVs to date in 2025—an increase of 891 percent (891%). The State \n7  envisions further growth in EV adoption over the next decade with a goal of registering  \n8  1.1 million passenger EVs by 2031 and the implementation of the State’s Advanced Clean \n9  Cars II regulation. \n10  175.  Maryland was apportioned approximately $69 million in NEVI Formula \n11  Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 and roughly $49 million of those funds were \n12  available for obligation to Maryland upon the FHWA’s approval of Maryland’s State Electric \n13  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering fiscal years 2022 through 2025. These funds \n14  would go towards completing the buildout of fast charging infrastructure along Maryland’s \n15  designated AFCs before building out Level 2 charging infrastructure in areas of the State \n16  without such infrastructure. \n17  176.  The FHWA previously authorized the obligation of approximately $14.5 million \n18  of NEVI Formula Program funds for Round 1 design-build procurement and administration, as \n19  designated in Maryland’s State Plans. Those funds will support the construction of public \n20  charging infrastructure at only 22 of the 50 sites needed to complete the State’s AFCs. \n21  177.  On December 17, 2024, MSHA launched its Round 2 procurement and \n22  simultaneously requested that the FHWA authorize the obligation of $475,000 to support \n23  Round 2. MSHA’s December 17, 2024, RFP was originally slated to close on March 26, 2025.  \n24  178.  As a result, however, of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Maryland has been \n25  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $34.5 million of its available \n26  NEVI Formula Program funds and the State has been forced to delay the deadline for Round 2 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   36  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 38 of 68\n \n1  proposal submissions. Based on Round 1 procurement data and available market estimates, \n2  MSHA estimates that the FHWA’s withholding of its remaining NEVI Formula Program funds \n3  would jeopardize the buildout of 180 additional fast charging ports along AFCs and 1,611 \n4  additional Level 2 charging ports in Maryland communities.8 \n5  179.  The delay in Round 2 procurement is also expected to increase costs to build \n6  charging infrastructure at the 29 sites targeted by that procurement. This increase in cost will \n7  necessarily reduce the total number of charging ports that can be built at sites away from \n8  AFCs. And this reduction in charging infrastructure may, in turn, lead to reduced adoption of \n9  EVs in the State, harming Maryland’s ability to meet its emission reduction goals and \n10  implement its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation.  \n11  Michigan \n12  180.   Michigan, through MDOT, was apportioned approximately $110 million over \n13  five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. Michigan’s shares of NEVI \n14  Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $87 million) were \n15  made available to Michigan to obligate upon approval of Michigan’s State Electric Vehicle \n16  Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. \n17  181.  FHWA previously authorized the obligation of approximately $58 million of \n18  MDOT’s apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds.   \n19  182.  MDOT used these obligated funds to carry out its State Plans and the purposes \n20  of the NEVI Formula Program by putting out its Round 1 Request for Proposals on August 31, \n21  2023, seeking proposals for the installation of up to 43 NEVI charging stations in Michigan. \n22  MDOT has entered into approximately 26 contracts and intends to enter into up to 8 additional \n23  contracts as the result of its Round 1 solicitation. \n24  / / / \n \n25 \n8 This MSHA estimate of fast charging and Level 2 charging ports includes infrastructure planned for \ndevelopment using the funds the FHWA is currently withholding unlawfully and Maryland’s apportioned share of \n26 \nfunds for fiscal year 2026.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   37  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 39 of 68\n \n1  183.  MDOT issued a Round 2 Request for Proposals on November 20, 2024, seeking \n2  proposals for the installation of up to 48 NEVI charging stations. MDOT has announced \n3  selections for Round 2 and is currently working toward contract execution for the selected \n4  vendors.   \n5  184.  However, as a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Michigan has been \n6  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $29 million of its available \n7  NEVI Formula Program funds, which the State intends to use to support a Round 3 solicitation \n8  to install up to an additional 65 EV charging stations.  \n9  185.  The loss of its NEVI Formula Program funds will significantly impede \n10  MDOT’s ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations.     \n11  Minnesota \n12  186.  Transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions in Minnesota. The State \n13  is seeing more frequent extreme weather events, drought, smoke from forest fires and potential \n14  loss of several species due to warming rivers and lakes as a result of climate change. To \n15  mitigate the damaging effects of climate change, MnDOT set interim GHG emissions targets in \n16  the Statewide Multimodal Transportation Plan for 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040. The Minnesota \n17  legislature updated the State goal to include interim targets, which align with the Statewide \n18  Multimodal Transportation Plan and the State’s Climate Action Framework. Minnesota’s Next \n19  Generation Energy Act of 2007, Minnesota Statutes, section 216H.02 requires Minnesota to \n20  reduce GHG emissions statewide to net zero by 2050. \n21  187.  To decrease transportation sector GHG emissions, Minnesota needs to invest in \n22  a range of strategies, including vehicle electrification, increasing travel options, and low \n23  carbon infrastructure and systems management. The State identified increased EV adoption as \n24  one way to reduce GHG emissions from transportation. A reliable statewide EV charging \n25  network is required to help alleviate Minnesota residents’ range anxiety and encourage  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   38  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 40 of 68\n \n1  EV adoption. The FHWA’s unlawful actions jeopardize Minnesota’s ability to reduce GHG \n2  emissions from transportation and ultimately put its climate change mitigation goals at risk. \n3  188.   In reliance on the FHWA’s compliance with the IIJA, MnDOT included NEVI \n4  Formula Program funds as a set-aside in its State Transportation Improvement Program \n5  (“STIP”). The 2025-2028 STIP includes the entire $68 million in funds apportioned to \n6  Minnesota under the NEVI Formula Program. When individual projects are identified, funds \n7  are broken out from the set-aside, reviewed through Metropolitan Planning Organization \n8  (“MPO”) processes, and modified in local Transportation Improvement Plans and the STIP, \n9  before federal obligation. \n10  189.  As of January 10, 2025, the FHWA had authorized obligation of NEVI Formula \n11  Program funds for 19 projects in Minnesota. A Round 1 RFP was opened December 2023 and \n12  closed April 2024. Round 1 resulted in 12 executed contracts to build 12 EV charging stations. \n13  Work on these projects is continuing.  \n14  190.  A Round 2 RFP was opened October 2024 and closed January 2025. In April \n15  2025, MnDOT awarded an additional 12 conditional awards to build an additional 12 EV \n16  charging stations. MnDOT is taking steps towards executing contracts for these projects, which \n17  will result in a total of 24 fully executed contracts in summer 2025.  \n18  191.  As stated previously, the FHWA has only obligated funds for 19 of these 24 \n19  projects.  \n20  192.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful action, which the Agency announced just \n21  before the MPO process for the five Round 2 projects without authorized obligations was \n22  complete, Minnesota cancelled those processes. To fulfill MnDOT’s commitment to \n23  encouraging EV use as a means to combat climate change, State funds were identified to move \n24  forward with Round 2 conditional awards. \n25  193.  However, Minnesota’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Needs Assessment, which \n26  resulted in the identification of future EV charging infrastructure projects throughout \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   39  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 41 of 68\n \n1  Minnesota, was completed in reliance on the State receiving its entire share of NEVI Formula \n2  Program funds—all $68 million. These projects are on hold.  \n3  194.  In addition, the majority of work to establish replicable and accountable \n4  frameworks for procurement and implementation of the NEVI Formula Program has already \n5  been done. The next step is to construct the tangible benefits for the public. Should any one of \n6  the three partners (federal, state, or awardee) back out at this time, it will have been a \n7  considerable waste of public and private resources and the benefits of a reliable statewide \n8  network of EV charging infrastructure will not be realized. \n9  New Jersey \n10  195.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, New Jersey has been immediately \n11  and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $73 million of its available NEVI \n12  Formula Program funds.  \n13  196.  Relying on the FHWA’s statutory obligation to disburse NEVI Formula \n14  Program funds, the Agency’s approval of New Jersey’s State Plans, and its prior \n15  authorizations, NJDOT awarded in December 2024 a publicly advertised contract for the \n16  development, planning, design, installation, five-year operation, and maintenance of 76 NEVI \n17  Formula Program compliant EV charging stations along 19 designated AFCs. \n18  197.  In the absence of the NEVI Formula Program funds the FHWA is unlawfully \n19  withholding, NJDOT cannot move forward with this initiative, and New Jersey is impeded \n20  from meeting its EV charging infrastructure goals, which are aimed at reducing environmental \n21  harms stemming from the transportation sector. \n22  New Mexico \n23  198.  The NEVI Formula Program joined numerous other climate action efforts \n24  occurring in New Mexico. In January 2019, New Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham signed \n25  Executive Order (EO) 2019-003, announcing New Mexico will continue to support the 2015 \n26  Paris Agreement goals and setting a statewide goal to reduce GHG emissions by at least forty-\n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   40  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 42 of 68\n \n1  five percent (45%) by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. EO 2019-003 also created the Interagency \n2  Climate Change Task Force (“CCTF”) to direct the efforts of multiple state agencies to reduce \n3  GHG emissions, improve air quality, and protect natural resources.  \n4  199.  The CCTF established ten interagency Climate Action Teams to propose, plan, \n5  and implement strategies. The CCTF has identified transportation decarbonization, including \n6  electrification, as key to reaching state GHG reduction goals. State agencies, including \n7  NMDOT, have been working together to advance decarbonization strategies, and recent \n8  successes include the May 2022 adoption of a Clean Cars Rule.  \n9  200.  As a member of the CCTF and in support of statewide goals, NMDOT is also \n10  actively working to build a climate action program that includes resiliency planning, \n11  developing carbon reduction strategies, implementing multimodal plans, and updating facilities \n12  with energy efficiency technologies and solar.  \n13  201.  The deployment of EVs and EV charging infrastructure in New Mexico will \n14  improve quality of life across the State by reducing GHG emissions and air pollution.  \n15  202.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, New Mexico has been \n16  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $18.5 million of its available \n17  NEVI Formula Program funds. Without that funding, New Mexico’s carefully planned efforts \n18  to build a network of EV charging infrastructure across the State to ensure all residents have \n19  the ability to choose an EV will be wasted and the State is unlikely to achieve its goal of \n20  building a future transportation system that serves all its people, including those in \n21  disadvantaged communities.  \n22  New York \n23  203.  New York, through NYSDOT was apportioned a total of approximately $175.5 \n24  million in funds over five fiscal years (fiscal years 2022 through 2026) dedicated to carrying \n25  out the NEVI Formula Program. New York’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal \n26  years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $138 million) was made available to New York to \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   41  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 43 of 68\n \n1  obligate upon the FHWA’s approval of New York’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n2  Deployment Plans covering those first four fiscal years. \n3  204.  NYSDOT engaged the Power Authority of New York to perform the first set of \n4  NEVI Formula Program funded projects in New York. That procurement concluded on \n5  September 8, 2023, wherein NYSDOT obligated $16.1 million to fund 23 initial projects along \n6  some of the State’s busiest transportation corridors. Eleven stations are operational and the \n7  remaining 12 stations are in development.  \n8  205.  NYSDOT also engaged the New York State Energy Research and Development \n9  Authority (“NYSERDA”) to conduct two solicitations for the next stage of NEVI Formula \n10  Program funded projects in New York.  \n11  206.  NYSERDA issued its first competitive solicitation, Program Opportunity Notice \n12  (“PON”) 5865, in September 2024 calling for proposals to develop fast charging stations along \n13  designated AFCs in New York with a focus on areas north of and including I-84. PON 5865 \n14  made $21.5 million in NEVI Formula Program funds available to proposers. Proposals in \n15  response to PON 5865 were received by December 4, 2024. NYSERDA’s evaluation of PON \n16  5865 proposals is complete. \n17  207.  In December 2024, NYSERDA issued a second solicitation for NEVI Formula \n18  Program funded fast charging station proposals, PON 5866, which focused on the areas around \n19  New York City, Long Island, and the lower Hudson Valley. PON 5866 made $28.5 million in \n20  NEVI Formula Program funds available to proposers. Proposals in response to PON 5866 were \n21  received by March 18, 2025. NYSERDA’s evaluation of PON 5866 proposals is in progress.  \n22  208.  On or about April 28, 2025, NYSDOT reviewed its unobligated NEVI Formula \n23  Program fund balance—estimated to be approximately $120 million for fiscal years 2022 \n24  through 2025 as NYSDOT had obligated approximately $17.7 million of its apportionment for \n25  those years as of that date—and discovered such funds unavailable for obligation in the FHWA \n26  portal.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   42  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 44 of 68\n \n1  209.  As a direct result of the FHWA’s actions, New York has been immediately and \n2  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $120 million of its available NEVI Formula \n3  Program funds, NYSDOT and NYSERDA cannot move forward under the two recently issued \n4  PONs, and all future uses of NEVI Formula Program funding are now on hold indefinitely.  \n5  210.  NEVI Formula Program funded EV charging infrastructure projects are critical \n6  to the economy and health of New York by broadening the availability of charging for all \n7  makes and models of EVs, addressing climate change, and protecting the health and welfare of \n8  New York’s residents. \n9  North Carolina \n10  211.  The transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in North \n11  Carolina. North Carolina has made commitments to minimize transportation-related emissions \n12  by encouraging the use of vehicles that rely on clean and renewable energy, including through \n13  Governor Cooper’s Executive Orders 90, 271, and 246, and plans resulting from them, as well \n14  as signing on to the Multi State Medium- and Heavy-Duty ZEV Memorandum. In addition, the \n15  State has passed legislation, House Bill 951 (“Energy Solutions for North Carolina,” \n16  S.L. 2021-165), which provides the North Carolina Utilities Commission authority to facilitate \n17  the build out of electrical vehicle charging infrastructure. \n18  212.  NCDOT and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality have \n19  prioritized (1) electrifying public and state fleets and (2) building a publicly accessible \n20  fast-charging network. To facilitate this, North Carolina’s State Plans are designed to expand \n21  access to convenient, reliable, and affordable electric vehicle charging. \n22  213.  North Carolina, through NCDOT, was apportioned approximately $109 million \n23  in NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022-2026. The first four apportionments \n24  (fiscal years 2022-2025) made roughly $86 million available to obligate. NCDOT released its \n25  NEVI Round 1 Request for Proposals on 11 priority “cluster” sites and issued conditional  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   43  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 45 of 68\n \n1  awards on September 9, 2024; a second cluster map was published on December 4, 2024, in \n2  preparation for Round 2. \n3  214.  As a direct result of FHWA’s unlawful actions, NCDOT could only proceed \n4  with the $5.9 million already tied to nine construction contracts, leaving roughly $103 million \n5  of North Carolina’s apportioned funds (approximately $80 million of which was made \n6  available for NC to obligate) inaccessible forcing NCDOT to pause work on the forthcoming \n7  Round 2 solicitation. \n8  Oregon \n9  215.  Oregon, through ODOT, was apportioned approximately $52 million in funds \n10  over five fiscal years (fiscal years 2022 through 2026) dedicated to carrying out the NEVI \n11  Formula Program. Oregon’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 \n12  through 2025 (approximately $41 million) were made available to Oregon to obligate upon the \n13  FHWA’s approval of Oregon’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \n14  covering those fiscal years. \n15  216.  For nearly 20 years, Oregon has actively pursued multi-pronged strategies to \n16  reduce harmful GHG emissions in the State. In 2019, the Oregon Legislature passed Senate \n17  Bill 1044, setting specific light-duty vehicle electrification goals for the State. The legislation \n18  established the following goals: 250,000 registered zero-emission vehicles by 2025, over one \n19  million by 2030 (50% of new vehicle sales), and 2.5 million by 2035 (90% of new vehicle \n20  sales). Installing publicly available EV charging stations throughout the State is essential for \n21  Oregon to meet its electrification goals. Oregon has determined it needs 8,000-13,000 public \n22  fast charging ports and 12,000-50,000 public Level 2 charging ports by 2030 to reach its \n23  goals. Oregon planned to use its NEVI Formula Program funds to develop a total of eleven \n24  AFCs, each to contain publicly accessible charging and alternative fueling infrastructure. \n25  217.  ODOT has thus far obligated approximately $26 million of its approximately \n26  $41 million in available NEVI Formula Program funds for planning, preliminary engineering, \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   44  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 46 of 68\n \n1  and construction phases for the installation of EV charging stations in eleven major Oregon \n2  corridors. \n3  218.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, ODOT has been immediately and \n4  indefinitely deprived of more than $12 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds. \n5  Without those funds, ODOT cannot develop eight of the eleven corridors, representing a loss \n6  of at least 40 fast charging stations, or a minimum of 160 charging ports. This accounts for \n7  roughly seventy-five percent (75%) of the estimated number of stations ODOT planned to \n8  develop. If the FHWA continues to withhold Oregon’s NEVI Formula Program funds, the \n9  State cannot move forward with the projects described in its State Plans and is highly unlikely \n10  to meet its goals of significantly reducing GHG emissions through transportation \n11  electrification. \n12  Pennsylvania \n13  219.  Pennsylvania, through PennDOT, was apportioned approximately $171.5 million \n14  over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program. Pennsylvania’s share of \n15  congressionally-appropriated and apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds included $25.4 \n16  million for fiscal year 2022 and $36.5 million, annually, for fiscal years 2023 through and \n17  including 2026. \n18  220.  In January 2025, PennDOT had authority to obligate $134.9 million of NEVI \n19  funding. At the time, PennDOT had obligated approximately $77 million to build out its AFC, \n20  leaving a balance of $58 million PennDOT was legally authorized to obligate. \n21  221.  FHWA’s illegal actions have prevented it from accessing $58 million of NEVI \n22  Formula Program funds. \n23  222.  As a direct result of FHWA’s unlawful actions, PennDOT and Governor \n24  Shapiro have been immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to $58 million of \n25  congressionally-appropriated and apportioned funds to carry out their State Plans, and they \n26  have had to incur costs and obligations without knowing whether or when FHWA would honor \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   45  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 47 of 68\n \n1  its legal obligations. Relief is necessary so that PennDOT can carry out its carefully-tailored \n2  State Plans that benefit Pennsylvania residents and meet transportation goals beneficial to those \n3  residents. \n4  Rhode Island \n5  223.  Rhode Island’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans were \n6  designed to establish a reliable, accessible, and interconnected EV fast charging network along \n7  critical transportation corridors, beginning with the designated Alternative Fuel Corridor (I-95) \n8  and expanding statewide. The Plans aimed to reduce range anxiety, promote EV adoption, \n9  support GHG emissions reductions, prioritize investments in disadvantaged communities, and \n10  prepare the State’s workforce and infrastructure for a sustainable, zero-emission transportation \n11  future. Each Plan was sequentially structured to build upon prior progress, moving from AFC \n12  compliance to equitable and sustainable statewide EV infrastructure expansion. \n13  224.  During Phase 1, for AFC buildout, infrastructure was deployed through a \n14  competitive procurement process with a selected vendor. The project was fully completed, all \n15  invoices were paid, and all contractual obligations were fulfilled. No pending invoices, \n16  encumbrances, or outstanding deliverables remain. \n17  225.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s compliance with the IIJA, the State issued a \n18  Phase 2 Request for Applications (RFA) in November 2024 to award $10 million to eligible \n19  public, tribal, higher education, and nonprofit entities. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful \n20  actions, Rhode Island halted the open Phase 2 RFA process.  \n21  226.  Forcing the closure of an active RFA period caused immediate disruption as \n22  many applicants had already initiated or completed their applications. Rhode Island has been \n23  unable to award funds to communities and public entities that invested time and resources \n24  preparing proposals.  \n25  227.  The short- and long-term harms to Rhode Island resulting from the FHWA’s \n26  unlawful actions are significant and numerous. Rhode Island has been immediately and \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   46  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 48 of 68\n \n1  indefinitely deprived of access to more than $16 million of its available NEVI Formula \n2  Program funds.  \n3  228.  Rhode Island is steadfast in its commitment to combat climate change and its \n4  harmful effects. To that end, the 2021 Act on Climate sets aggressive decarbonization \n5  requirements for the State. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-1, et. seq. This includes mandates that \n6  statewide GHG emissions reach forty-five percent (45%) below 1990 levels by 2030; eighty \n7  percent (80%) below 1990 levels by 2040, and that the State achieves net-zero emissions by \n8  2050. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-9. \n9  229.  In furtherance of its climate goals, Rhode Island is also firmly committed to \n10  reducing transportation-sector GHG emissions and advancing transportation electrification as a \n11  critical element of its broader climate strategy. Transportation emissions account for over thirty \n12  percent (30%) of Rhode Island’s total GHG emissions, making it the largest single source of \n13  emissions in the state. Delays in EV infrastructure deployment caused by the FHWA’s \n14  unlawful actions jeopardize the State’s ability to meet its GHG reduction mandates under the \n15  Act on Climate, as well as other regional air quality improvement goals.  \n16  230.  In addition, future EV charging infrastructure projects are likely to face \n17  increased construction, equipment, and labor costs due to inflation and ongoing supply chain \n18  instability.  \n19  231.  The uncertainty caused by the FHWA’s unlawful actions also stands to reduce \n20  the pool of capable partners willing to engage in future solicitations. Moreover, workforce \n21  development efforts, including EV technician training and pipeline programs associated with \n22  Phase 2 of the program in Rhode Island, have been delayed, undermining economic \n23  development opportunities tied to growth of the clean transportation sector. \n24  232.  Reopening or redesigning paused solicitations will also require additional State \n25  resources and will extend project delivery timelines.  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   47  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 49 of 68\n \n1  Vermont \n2  233.  Vermont, through VTrans, was apportioned an approximate total of $21 million \n3  in funds over five fiscal years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. \n4  Vermont’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 were \n5  made available to Vermont to obligate upon the FHWA’s approval of its State Electric Vehicle \n6  Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. The first four fiscal years of \n7  apportioned funding equaled approximately $16.7 million. \n8  234.  Vermont has long supported the deployment of EVs and other ZEVs across \n9  multiple vehicle classes as a means of reducing the environmental effects of the transportation \n10  sector and achieving its State GHG emissions reduction targets. For example, Vermont’s \n11  Global Warming Solutions Act requires Vermont to significantly reduce GHG emissions \n12  below historic levels in the coming decades, and Vermont has prepared a Climate Action Plan \n13  to identify steps to meet those goals. Development of EV charging infrastructure to support \n14  transportation electrification is a Climate Action Plan priority. \n15  235.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s approval of its State Plans, which, consistent \n16  with the IIJA, NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the FHWA’s representations, made \n17  NEVI Formula Program funds available for obligation until expended, Vermont, among other \n18  things, awarded EV fast charging port projects totaling approximately $9.3 million. Without its \n19  NEVI Formula Program funds, Vermont cannot fund all of the projects the State has awarded.  \n20  Wisconsin \n21  236.  In response to the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Wisconsin was forced to cease \n22  work related to 15 NEVI Formula Program awards and a current RFP issued to solicit \n23  proposals for additional NEVI Formula Program funded projects.  \n24  237.  In January 2024, WisDOT issued a NOFO and RFP through the NEVI Formula \n25  Program for charging infrastructure along Wisconsin’s approved AFCs. The NOFO/RFP \n26  closed on May 23, 2024. WisDOT issued 53 awards. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   48  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 50 of 68\n \n1  actions, WisDOT cannot take any further action on 15 of these awards, which represents \n2  approximately $7.3 million. \n3  238.  On October 14, 2024, WisDOT issued a second RFP with the intention of \n4  issuing awards in Spring 2025. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, WisDOT cannot \n5  issue any awards under this RFP. \n6  239.  WisDOT has been immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to \n7  approximately $62.65 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds. In the absence of \n8  those funds, WisDOT cannot fund the 15 projects awarded under its January 2024 RFP or issue \n9  any new awards to carry out EV charging infrastructure projects. \n10  240.  NEVI Formula Program funded EV charging infrastructure projects are critical \n11  to the economy and health of Wisconsin by broadening the availability of EV charging for all \n12  makes and models of EVs, which helps address climate change and protects the health and \n13  welfare of Wisconsin’s residents. \n14  241.  Even if the FHWA issues new final NEVI Formula Program Guidance in the \n15  very near future, Plaintiff States will shoulder the unnecessary cost and burden of developing \n16  new State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans despite having invested months \n17  and significant resources developing its previous plans. \n18  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n19 \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – In Excess of Statutory Authority \n20  Revocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n242.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n21 \npreceding paragraphs. \n22 \n243.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n23 \n244.  Under the APA, the court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n24 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \n25 \nlimitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   49  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 51 of 68\n \n1  245.  An agency may not take any action that exceeds the scope of its statutory \n2  authority. \n3  246.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n4  Defendants to suspend or revoke State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n5  approvals, either individually or categorically. \n6  247.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n7  Defendants to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds. \n8  248.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n9  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n10  249.  Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n11  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n12  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds exceed Defendants’ statutory authority and must be \n13  set aside. \n14  250.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n15  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n16  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n17  COUNT II \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious and Not in \n18  Accordance with Law \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n19 \n251.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n20 \npreceding paragraphs. \n21 \n252.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n22 \n253.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n23 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n24 \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n25 \n/ / / \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   50  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 52 of 68\n \n1  254.  Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the action contravenes or \n2  otherwise fails to implement the statutory directives of Congress consistent with the statute’s \n3  text, structure, and purpose. \n4  255.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails to articulate a \n5  reasoned explanation for its action, fails to consider reasonable alternatives, fails to consider \n6  important factors, and/or considers factors Congress did not intend it to consider. Agency \n7  action is also arbitrary and capricious if, when departing from a prior policy, an agency fails to \n8  display awareness it is changing its position, fails to consider serious reliance interests, or fails \n9  to demonstrate that there are good reasons for the new policy, which also must be permissible \n10  under the statute. \n11  256.  Agency action taken on pretextual grounds violates the APA’s requirements of \n12  reasoned agency decision-making. \n13  257.  The Defendants made no factual or legal findings, nor did they provide any \n14  reasoned basis for their actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State Electric Vehicle \n15  Deployment Plan approvals.  \n16  258.  The Defendants’ sole stated rationale for their action to “suspend” or revoke all \n17  State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals—that the recission of the NEVI Formula \n18  Program Guidance necessitated the retroactive and categorical “suspension” or revocation of \n19  all State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals—is a contrived, irrational, and \n20  insufficient explanation and thus not a reasoned basis for the action. \n21  259.  The Defendants failed to consider whether “suspending” or revoking all State \n22  Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals was consistent with the purpose and objectives of \n23  the IIJA and the NEVI Formula Program as established by Congress. \n24  260.   The Defendants failed to engage in reasoned consideration of any individual \n25  State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan before categorically “suspending” or revoking all Plan \n26  approvals and did not provide reasoned explanation for doing so.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   51  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 53 of 68\n \n1  261.  Likewise, Defendants failed to engage in reasoned, individualized consideration \n2  of any State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan or any actions taken by Plaintiff States to carry \n3  out those Plans before categorically withdrawing or withholding NEVI Formula Program \n4  funds. \n5  262.  The Defendants failed to consider obvious, reasonable, and lawful alternatives \n6  to their actions, such as complying with the requirements of the IIJA and honoring their prior \n7  approval of Plaintiff States’ State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans for fiscal \n8  years 2022 through 2025 while updating NEVI Formula Program Guidance to govern the \n9  submission of fiscal year 2026 Plans. \n10  263.  The Defendants’ stated rationale for their action to “suspend” or revoke all State \n11  Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals and their failure to consider reasonable \n12  alternatives exposes the pretextual nature of the Defendants’ actions. Upon information and \n13  belief—and as a matter of common sense—the Defendants “suspended” or revoked all State \n14  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals to implement the President’s \n15  directive to withhold funds “for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the \n16  National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” Exec. Order 14154, 90 Fed. \n17  Reg. at 8357. \n18  264.  The Defendants failed to consider Plaintiff States’ serious reliance interests, \n19  including on the FHWA’s prior approvals of their State Plans and the States’ expectation that \n20  the FHWA would distribute their NEVI Formula Program funds as required.  \n21  265.  The Defendants therefore failed to consider the consequences of categorically \n22  “suspending” or revoking approval of all State Plans and categorically withholding or \n23  withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds.  \n24  266.  The Defendants also failed to demonstrate good reasons for their change in \n25  position and their new position directly conflicts with the IIJA and is therefore impermissible \n26  under the statute. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   52  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 54 of 68\n \n1  267.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n2  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n3  268.  Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n4  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n5  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds must be set aside as arbitrary, capricious, and not \n6  in accordance with law. \n7  269.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n8  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n9  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n10  COUNT III \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – Not in Accordance with Law and \n11 \nWithout Observance of Procedure Required By Law \n12  Withholding of Funds \n270.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n13 \npreceding paragraphs. \n14 \n271.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n15 \n272.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n16 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law . . . [or] without \n17 \nobservance of procedure required by law” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). \n18 \n273.  Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the action contravenes or \n19 \notherwise fails to implement the statutory directives of Congress consistent with the statute’s \n20 \ntext, structure, and purpose. \n21 \n274.  Judicial review of an agency’s procedural compliance is “exacting.” See Kern \n22 \nCnty. Farm Bureau v. Allen, 450 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir. 2006). \n23 \n275.  The IIJA provides an exclusive list of circumstances in which the Defendants \n24 \nmay withhold or withdraw from a State its share of NEVI Formula Program funds for a fiscal \n25 \nyear. \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   53  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 55 of 68\n \n1  276.  The Defendants may withhold a State’s funds if it fails to timely submit a State \n2  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan. After a State has submitted its Plan, the \n3  Defendants may withhold or withdraw a State’s funds for the fiscal year(s) covered by the Plan \n4  only after determining that the State has not taken actions to carry out that Plan, and only after \n5  following all statutorily required procedure. \n6  277.  Specifically, before determining that a State has not taken actions to carry out \n7  its Plan, the Defendants must comply with the strict procedural requirements set out in the \n8  IIJA, including to “notify the State, consult with the State, and identify actions that can be \n9  taken to rectify concerns, and provide at least 90 days for the State to rectify concerns and take \n10  action to carry out its plan.” 135 Stat. at 1422. \n11  278.  After making a determination that a State has not taken action to carry out its \n12  Plan, the Defendant must comply with additional procedural requirements before withholding \n13  or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds from the State. Specifically, the Defendants \n14  must give a further 60 days’ notice, an opportunity to be heard, and an opportunity to appeal \n15  before withholding or withdrawing any funds.” Id. \n16  279.  The Defendants’ action to prohibit obligations of NEVI Formula Program funds \n17  made available for obligation through the FHWA’s approval of each State’s State Electric \n18  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans constitutes a withdrawal or withholding of NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds. \n20  280.  The Defendants have therefore withdrawn and withheld NEVI Formula \n21  Program funds from Plaintiff States without making the statutorily required determination that \n22  Plaintiff States have not taken action to carry out their plans and without following any \n23  statutorily required procedure.  \n24  281.  The Defendants failed to provide notice, consult with Plaintiff States, or identify \n25  any concerns with Plaintiff States’ actions to carry out their State Electric Vehicle \n26  Infrastructure Deployment Plans. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   54  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 56 of 68\n \n1  282.  The Defendants failed to provide at least 90 days for Plaintiff States to rectify \n2  any concerns, failed to provide the statutorily required 60-day notice to Plaintiff States on their \n3  intent to withhold or withdraw funds, and failed to provide any opportunity to appeal the \n4  FHWA’s decision to withhold or withdraw funds. \n5  283.  Rather than follow the procedure to withhold or withdraw funds set forth by \n6  Congress in the IIJA, the Defendants achieved their goal of withholding NEVI Formula \n7  Program funds by prohibiting new obligations on the basis of their own unlawful “suspension” \n8  or revocation of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals, which \n9  was predicated solely on their recission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance.   \n10  284.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n11  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n12  285.  Accordingly, Defendants’ action to withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula \n13  Program funds must therefore be set aside as not in accordance with law and without \n14  observance of procedure required by law.  \n15  286.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n16  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n17  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n18  COUNT IV \nViolation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine, Usurping Congressional Authority \n19  Revocation of State Plan Approvals and Prohibition on Obligations \n20  287.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n21  preceding paragraphs. \n22  288.  Congress possesses exclusive power to legislate. Article I, Section 1 of the \n23  Constitution states that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of \n24  the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” U.S. Const. \n25  art. I, § 1; see Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (“There is no provision in \n26  the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”).  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   55  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 57 of 68\n \n1  289.  The Constitution also “grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \n2  President.” City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018); see \n3  U.S. Const. art. I, §9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending \n4  Clause). \n5  290.  The Constitution strictly controls how legislation enacted by Congress and \n6  signed into law by the President may be amended or repealed. Article I of the Constitution \n7  prescribes a “single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered[] procedure” for enacting \n8  such an amendment or repeal: passage of a new bill by both houses of Congress and \n9  presentment to the President for his signature or veto. Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. \n10  Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983); see U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2, 3. The Constitution \n11  identifies specific roles for the Executive in the lawmaking process, via the Recommendation \n12  Clause and the Presentment Clause, which creates the President’s veto power; outside these \n13  roles, the Executive Branch has no authority to change the law to suit the President’s policy. \n14  U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; id. § 7, cl. 2; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, \n15  587 (1952) (“In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws \n16  are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his \n17  functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the \n18  vetoing of laws he thinks bad.”); cf. Perry v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 582 U.S. 420, 441 (2017) \n19  (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (“If a statute needs repair, there’s a constitutionally prescribed way to \n20  do it. It’s called legislation. To be sure, the demands of bicameralism and presentment are real \n21  and the process can be protracted. But the difficulty of making new laws isn’t some bug in the \n22  constitutional design: it’s the point of the design, the better to preserve liberty.”). \n23  291.  Consistent with these principles, the Executive acts at the lowest ebb of his \n24  constitutional authority and power when he acts contrary to the will of Congress by attempting \n25  to unilaterally decline to spend appropriated funds. See Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637-638 \n26  (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   56  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 58 of 68\n \n1  292.  The Executive’s authority is particularly limited where, as here, Congress \n2  mandated that the Defendants disburse congressionally appropriated NEVI Formula Program \n3  funds to States in amounts in accordance with a specific formula, and the Defendants’ actions \n4  are incompatible with congressional directive. Congress established the NEVI Formula \n5  Program and appropriated funds for the express purpose of providing the States with funding \n6  for EV charging infrastructure and directed precise amounts to each State leaving no discretion \n7  for the Executive Branch with respect to those amounts.  \n8  293.  Congress has generally provided for a procedure by which the Executive may \n9  propose to Congress to either rescind or cancel funds. See Congressional Budget and \n10  Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. §§ 682 et seq. Congress also specifically \n11  prescribed the exclusive grounds for which the Defendants could withhold or withdraw NEVI \n12  Formula Program funds from a State and the procedure with which the Defendants must \n13  comply before doing so. Congress also mandated that funds lawfully withheld or withdrawn \n14  from a State be redistributed to other States and local jurisdictions for EV infrastructure \n15  development. \n16  294.  The Impoundment Control Act precludes the Executive from refusing to spend \n17  or distribute congressionally appropriated funds, instead requiring the President to “propose[]” \n18  any rescission to Congress (which Congress must then affirmatively approve). 2 U.S.C. \n19  §§ 683, 684(a). The Impoundment Control Act also does not authorize the Executive to defer \n20  funding for the reasons the Defendants invoke here. As described above, the Administration \n21  generally opposes the IIJA, and the NEVI Formula Program specifically, on policy grounds. \n22  Accordingly, the Executive’s authority is at its “lowest ebb.” See Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637-\n23  638 (Jackson, J., concurring). \n24  295.  The Defendants’ actions to “suspend” or revoke all State Electric Vehicle \n25  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI \n26  Formula Program funds violate the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   57  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 59 of 68\n \n1  impermissibly arrogates to the Executive legislative and spending powers reserved to \n2  Congress. \n3  296.

Federal courts may also set aside agency action found to be \n8  “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n9  297.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n10  affected by the Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n11  298.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff States are \n12  entitled to a declaration that the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n13  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n14  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the constitutional separation of powers \n15  doctrine and impermissibly arrogate to the Executive power reserved to Congress. \n16  COUNT V \nViolation of Take Care Clause  \n17 \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n18  299.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n19  preceding paragraphs. \n20  300.  The Take Care Clause provides that the Executive must “take Care that the \n21  Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; Utility Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. \n22  302, 327 (2014) (“Under our system of government, Congress makes laws and the President \n23  . . . ‘faithfully execute[s]’ them.”). \n24  301.  The Executive Branch violates the Take Care Clause where it declines to \n25  execute or otherwise undermines statutes enacted by Congress and signed into law.

Plaintiff States are “entitled to invoke the equitable jurisdiction to restrain enforcement” \n16  of unconstitutional acts by federal officials. Panama Ref. Co., 293 U.S. at 414. Federal courts \n17  may also set aside agency action found to be “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \n18  or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n19  305.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n20  affected by the Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n21  306.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff States are \n22  entitled to a declaration that the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n23  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n24  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the Take Care Clause. \n25  / / / \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   59  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 61 of 68\n \n1  COUNT VI \nCommon Law Ultra Vires \n2 \nConduct Outside the Scope of Statutory Authority Conferred on the Executive \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n3 \n307.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n4 \npreceding paragraphs. \n5 \n308.  Plaintiff States have a non-statutory right of action to have action taken in \n6 \nexcess of legal authority declared unlawful. \n7 \n309.  Agency or executive officer action taken in excess of legal authority is ultra \n8 \nvires. \n9 \n310.  A court reviewing executive action has an independent duty to determine what \n10 \nthe law is and whether executive officers invoking statutory authority exceed their statutory \n11 \npower. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. at 327.  \n12 \n311.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n13 \nDefendants to suspend or revoke State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n14 \napprovals, either individually or categorically. \n15 \n312.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n16 \nDefendants to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds. \n17 \n313.  The Defendants have therefore acted contrary to law and ultra vires by \n18 \ncategorically “suspending” or revoking all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment \n19 \nPlan approvals and categorically withholding or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds. \n20 \n314.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \n21 \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. \n22 \nat 327. Plaintiff States are “entitled to invoke the equitable jurisdiction to restrain enforcement” \n23 \nof unconstitutional acts by federal officials. Panama Ref. Co., 293 U.S. at 414. \n24 \n315.

Declare the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State \n6  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically \n7  withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the APA. \n8  b.  Declare the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State \n9  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically \n10  withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the separation of \n11  powers doctrine and the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n12  c.  Declare the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State \n13  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically \n14  withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds are contrary to the law, \n15  outside the Defendants’ authority, and therefore unlawful under the common law \n16  ultra vires doctrine. \n17  d.  Vacate the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke Plaintiff \n18  States’  Electric  Vehicle  Infrastructure  Deployment  Plan  approvals  and  to \n19  categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds. \n20  e.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  the  Defendants  from  “suspending” or \n21  revoking Plaintiff States’ Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals. \n22  f.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  the  Defendants  from  withholding  or \n23  withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds for any reason not set forth in the \n24  IIJA  or  applicable  FHWA  regulations,  and  without  following  the  IIJA’s \n25  procedural requirements, including by refusing to review and process Plaintiff  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   61  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 63 of 68\n \n1  States’ requests for authorization to obligate funds for specific EV charging \n2  infrastructure development activities in the normal course. \n3  g.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Defendants from implementing any \n4  requirement,  policy,  or  guidance  that  contravenes  congressional  intent  and \n5  directive in making authorization request decisions and obligating funds for \n6  specific activities.  \n7  h.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Defendants from implementing or \n8  effectuating through any action the directive in the Executive Order to withhold \n9  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds in contravention of the express \n10  congressional mandates in the IIJA.  \n11  i.  Retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the orders of this Court. \n12  j.  Award the Plaintiff States their reasonable fees, costs, and expenses, including \n13  attorneys’ fees, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412. \n14  k.

President Trump has unleashed an attack on an increasingly popular consumer \n3 \nchoice—the electric vehicle. On Inauguration Day, the President issued an executive order \n4 \nentitled Unleashing American Energy (“Executive Order”), which proclaims it the policy of \n5 \nthe United States to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, \n6 \n90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025). The federal government, however, has never adopted any \n7 \nsuch “EV mandate.” But in the name of eliminating this fictional mandate, the Executive Order \n8 \ndirects the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA” or “Agency”) to usurp the legislative \n9 \nand spending powers reserved to Congress by withholding congressionally appropriated \n10 \nfunding for electric vehicle (“EV”) charging infrastructure required by statute to be distributed \n11 \nto States. \n12 \n2.  Specifically, in a section of the Executive Order entitled “Terminating the \n13 \nGreen New Deal,” the President mandated all federal agencies to “immediately pause the \n14 \ndisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law \n15 \n117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not \n16 \nlimited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National \n17 \nElectric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. \n18 \nat 8357. This, the Executive Branch cannot do. \n19 \n3.  Congress established the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (“NEVI”) \n20 \nFormula Program, through enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), \n21 \nalso known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The IIJA appropriated $5 billion for the \n22 \nexplicit purpose of “providing funding to the States to strategically deploy electric vehicle \n23 \ncharging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected network to facilitate data collection, \n24 \naccess, and reliability.” Pub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, 1421 (2021).

Id. at 1422. \n3  4.  The FHWA, although tasked with faithfully administering the NEVI Formula \n4  Program, almost immediately carried out President Trump’s anti-NEVI directive in diametric \n5  opposition to statutory mandate.  \n6  5.  On February 6, 2025, the FHWA notified States via letter (“FHWA Letter”) that \n7  it had taken three actions to categorically and indefinitely “suspend” the NEVI Formula \n8  Program. First, the Agency announced it had rescinded all versions of statutorily required \n9  NEVI Formula Program Guidance. Second—with no advance notice and without reasoned \n10  explanation—the Agency unlawfully revoked all prior approvals of NEVI Formula Program \n11  implementation plans (“State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans” or “State \n12  Plans”), which States are required to submit to access their share of NEVI Formula Program \n13  funds. In fact, the FHWA retroactively and categorically revoked its prior approval of every \n14  State Plan—more than 150 in total—on the sole basis of its recission of the NEVI Formula \n15  Program Guidance.  \n16  6.  Finally, the FHWA informed the States that “no new obligations may occur \n17  under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is \n18  issued and new State [P]lans are submitted and approved.” The FHWA cited no other reasons \n19  for prohibiting new obligations other than its own retroactive revocation of all State Plan \n20  approvals, an action that itself was predicated only on the Agency’s recission of the NEVI \n21  Formula Program Guidance.  \n22  7.  The FHWA’s actions had the effect of withholding or withdrawing from States \n23  NEVI Formula Program funds available to the States for obligation, functionally abrogating \n24  the congressionally mandated NEVI Formula Program by executive fiat.  \n25 \n \n1 For the purposes of this Complaint, the term “States” includes Puerto Rico and the District of \n26 \nColumbia. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 4 of 68\n \n1  8.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants’ \n2  unlawful actions. \n3  9.  Plaintiff States have invested in programs to encourage adoption of EVs as a \n4  means of reducing smog, air toxics, and other harmful pollution from combustion engine \n5  vehicle emissions, which cause grave health problems such as cancer and asthma, and \n6  contributes to the devastating effects of climate change in these States. \n7  10.  The Defendants’ actions impede Plaintiff States’ ability to build the EV \n8  charging infrastructure envisioned under the IIJA and necessary for widespread EV adoption. \n9  This infrastructure is critical to the success of Plaintiff States’ environmental, public health, \n10  and transportation programs—projects Congress actively chose to support in enacting the IIJA \n11  and establishing the NEVI Formula Program. The harms to Plaintiff States will continue and \n12  become increasingly damaging if unabated. \n13  11.  To prevent irreparable injury to Plaintiff States, this Court should declare that \n14  the Defendants’ actions to implement the President’s directive are unlawful under the \n15  Administrative Procedure Act, violate the United States Constitution, and are contrary to the \n16  law, outside the Defendants’ authority, and unlawful under the common law ultra vires \n17  doctrine. Plaintiff States therefore request that this Court vacate the Defendants’ unlawful \n18  actions and preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from, among other things, \n19  implementing or effectuating the directive in the Executive Order to withhold NEVI Formula \n20  Program funds in contravention of the express congressional mandates in the IIJA.  \n21  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22  12.

Congress Established the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula \n16 \nProgram to Fund Strategic Deployment of Electric Vehicle Charging \nInfrastructure \n17 \n18  40.  On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan \n19  Infrastructure Law, enacted as the IIJA. 135 Stat. 429. \n20  41.  The IIJA establishes the NEVI Formula Program. Through the IIJA, Congress \n21  appropriated $5 billion and mandated that those funds “shall be to carry out the [NEVI] \n22  Formula Program” and must “remain available until expended.” Id. at 1421. \n23  NEVI Formula Program funds are “formula” funds. See, e.g., City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 \n24  F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir. 2019). Unlike discretionary funding, formula funds are appropriated by \n25  Congress for a specific purpose and must be distributed on the basis of a statutory formula. The  \n26  / / /  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 9 of 68\n \n1  NEVI Formula Program applies the same federal formula as that which is used to distribute \n2  highway funds. 135 Stat. at 1422.  \n3  42.  The purpose of the NEVI Formula Program is to “provide funding to States to \n4  strategically deploy electric vehicle charging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected \n5  network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability.” Id. at 1421. \n6  43.  More specifically, after setting aside funds for NEVI Formula Program \n7  administration and an additional grant program, NEVI Formula Program funds apportioned to \n8  States “shall be used for: (1) the acquisition and installation of electric vehicle charging \n9  infrastructure to serve as a catalyst for the deployment of such infrastructure and to connect it \n10  to a network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability; (2) proper operation and \n11  maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and (3) data sharing about electric \n12  vehicle charging infrastructure to ensure the long-term success of investments made under [the \n13  NEVI Formula Program provisions of the IIJA].” Id. at. 1421-22; see also id. at 1425 \n14  (discussing set-asides). \n15  44.  The NEVI Formula Program first prioritizes building out “alternative fuel \n16  corridor[s]” with EV charging infrastructure along the national highway system to support \n17  long-distance travel and increase driver confidence in charging port availability during intra- \n18  and interstate travel. Id. at 1423-24. Focusing first on this national network of alternative fuel \n19  corridors (“AFCs”) helps ensure that drivers beyond urban commuter areas have the option to \n20  choose an EV. \n21  45.  Distribution of NEVI Formula Program funds is not discretionary: The \n22  Secretary of Transportation (“Secretary”) “shall distribute among the States the [NEVI \n23  Formula Program funds] so that each State receives” the amount determined by the formula. \n24  Id. at 1422 (emphasis added). Indeed, as explained below, even in the limited circumstances a \n25  State may become ineligible to receive its share of NEVI Formula Program funds for a \n26  particular fiscal year, the IIJA requires the Secretary to distribute all lawfully withheld or \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 10 of 68\n \n1  withdrawn funds to local jurisdictions within that State, or to other States, for the \n2  congressionally mandated purpose of building out EV charging infrastructure. See id. at 1422-\n3  23. \n4  46.  Congress established a single prerequisite for a State to receive its share of the \n5  NEVI Formula Program funding appropriated by Congress: Each State must submit a State \n6  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan, by a deadline established by the Secretary, \n7  describing how it “intends to use funds distributed to the State . . . to carry out the [NEVI \n8  Formula] Program for each fiscal year in which funds are made available.” Id. at. 1422. \n9  47.  The IIJA further requires the Secretary, within 90 days of the statute’s \n10  enactment, and in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, to develop “guidance for States \n11  and localities to strategically deploy electric vehicle charging infrastructure” consistent with \n12  the NEVI Formula Program provisions of the IIJA (“NEVI Formula Program Guidance”). Id. \n13  at 1423. \n14  48.  The FHWA issued NEVI Formula Program Guidance on February 10, 2022, \n15  and has updated the guidance annually. The FHWA issued the most recent update on June 11, \n16  2024. \n17  B.  Process to Distribute Nondiscretionary NEVI Formula Program Funds to States \n49.  NEVI Formula Program funds are distributed in accordance with a well-defined \n18 \nprocess. The first step in this process was the congressional appropriation, which authorized \n19 \nthe FHWA to incur financial obligations that will result in immediate or future disbursements \n20 \nof funds from the U.S. Treasury. See 2 U.S.C. § 622(2)(A)(i). In the IIJA, Congress \n21 \nappropriated $5 billion, “to remain available until expended,” to carry out the NEVI Formula \n22 \nProgram in accordance with specific directives and subject to express constraints. 135 Stat. at \n23 \n1421. \n24 \n50.  Next, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), which administers \n25 \nthe federal budget, apportioned the funds appropriated by Congress by dividing the $5 billion \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   9  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 11 of 68\n \n1  appropriation across five fiscal years and distributed the funds to the FHWA. See U.S. Gov’t \n2  Accountability Off., GAO-05-734SP, A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget \n3  Process, at 12-13 (Sept. 2005) (“Budget Glossary”).2 The FHWA, which is within the U.S. \n4  Department of Transportation (“U.S. DOT”), annually certifies a further apportionment. This \n5  further apportionment includes setting aside the funds for NEVI Formula Program \n6  administration of the and an additional grant program. The FHWA then divides the remaining \n7  funds for that fiscal year among the States according to the non-discretionary statutory \n8  formula.  \n9  51.  The IIJA’s formula explicitly requires the Secretary to apportion NEVI Formula \n10  Program funds among the States, such that each receives a share of funding proportional to the \n11  combined amount that the FHWA distributes in Federal-aid highway apportionments.3, 4 135 \n12  Stat. at 1422 (citing 23 U.S.C. § 104(c) and § 165). Those amounts are fixed in statute based \n13  on historical apportionments and congressionally determined shares, 23 U.S.C. §§ 104(c), 165. \n14  Neither the Secretary nor the FHWA, nor any other part of the Executive Branch has discretion \n15  to determine the amount of funding apportioned to any State under the NEVI Formula \n16  Program.  \n17  52.  After reviewing each State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n18  submitted, the FHWA notifies each State by letter that its funds for the fiscal year(s) covered \n19  by the Plan are “available for obligation.”5  \n20  53.  An obligation is a “definite commitment that creates a legal liability of the \n21  government for the payment of goods and services ordered or received, or a legal duty on the \n22   \n2 Available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf. \n23  3 Puerto Rico’s share is equal to the amount the FHWA distributes in Puerto Rico Highway Program \nfunding. \n24  4 See, e.g., FHWA, Notice: Apportionment of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Highway Infrastructure Program \nFunds for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program Pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment \nand Jobs Act (Feb. 10, 2022), a true and accurate copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n25 \n5 See, e.g., FHWA Letter to Washington State, Approval of Washington State Electric Vehicle \nInfrastructure Deployment Plan (September 14, 2022), a true and accurate copy of which is attached hereto as \n26 \nExhibit B. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   10  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 12 of 68\n \n1  part of the United States that could mature into” such a liability; an “expenditure,” also known \n2  as a “disbursement,” is the actual spending of federal funds. Budget Glossary at 45, 48, 70.  \n3  54.  States obligate their share of apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds by \n4  submitting to the FHWA an authorization request for specific activities. So long as the \n5  activities for which a State requests authorization meet the minimum standards and \n6  requirements to be funded by NEVI Formula Program funds, see 23 C.F.R. Part 680, the \n7  FHWA must approve State’s requests for authorization. Upon FHWA authorization, NEVI \n8  Formula Program funds are obligated for those activities. When the State submits to the \n9  FHWA expenses incurred for those activities, it can draw down the obligated funds, which are \n10  then disbursed into State accounts. The FHWA’s authority to withhold or withdraw those \n11  funds is tightly conscribed by the IIJA. \n12  55.  By way of analogy, the amounts made “available for obligation” are like the \n13  credit limit on a credit card; the obligation is the swipe of the credit card at a point-of-sale \n14  device; and the disbursement is the transfer of funds to pay the bill. \n15  C.  Congress Expressly Prescribed the Circumstances and Procedures Under Which \nthe Federal Highway Administration is Authorized to Withhold or Withdraw \n16  NEVI Formula Program Funds from States \n56.  Congress expressly limited the Secretary’s discretion to withhold or withdraw \n17 \nNEVI Formula Program funds from States. The Secretary must distribute to each State its \n18 \nshare of NEVI Formula Program funds unless the State fails to timely submit its State Electric \n19 \nVehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan or if the Secretary “determines a State has not taken \n20 \naction to carry out its [State P]lan.” 135 Stat. at 1422. \n21 \n57.  In addition to clear substantive parameters, Congress imposed strict procedural \n22 \nrequirements the Secretary must follow: “[P]rior to the Secretary making a determination that a \n23 \nState has not taken actions to carry out its plan, the Secretary shall notify the State, consult \n24 \nwith the State, and identify actions that can be taken to rectify concerns, and provide at least 90 \n25 \ndays for the State to rectify concerns and take action to carry out its [State P]lan.” Id. Then, if \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   11  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 13 of 68\n \n1  the Secretary still makes a determination that the State has not taken actions to carry out its \n2  State Plan, the Secretary must give additional notice and an opportunity to be heard before \n3  withholding or withdrawing any funds: “The Secretary shall provide notice to a State on the \n4  intent to withhold or withdraw funds not less than 60 days before withholding or withdrawing \n5  any funds, during which time the State[] shall have an opportunity to appeal a decision to \n6  withhold or withdraw funds directly to the Secretary.” Id. \n7  58.  To further cement that NEVI Formula Program funds must be distributed for the \n8  purpose of building EV charging infrastructure, the IIJA expressly mandates that the Secretary \n9  redistribute all funds lawfully withheld or withdrawn from a State in a given fiscal year to \n10  other jurisdictions. To redistribute withheld or withdrawn funds, the Secretary may “award \n11  such funds on a competitive basis to local jurisdictions within the State for use on projects that \n12  meet the eligibility requirements.” Id. If the Secretary cannot fully award these funds to local \n13  jurisdictions within the State, “any such funds remaining shall be distributed among other \n14  States . . . in the same manner as funds distributed for that fiscal year.” Id. at 1422-23 \n15  (emphasis added). Whatever the scenario, the NEVI Formula Program funds appropriated by \n16  Congress must always be distributed to support State or local government EV charging \n17  infrastructure projects. \n18  59.  Congress did not give the Secretary authority to suspend or revoke its approval \n19  of State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans and certainly did not authorize the \n20  FHWA to suspend or revoke approval of every State Plan categorically. If a State submits a \n21  Plan by the deadline, the FHWA must provide that State with its share of NEVI Formula \n22  Program funds for the fiscal year(s) covered by that Plan unless the State fails to take action to \n23  carry out the Plan and the Secretary follows the required statutory procedures, including but \n24  not limited to notice and an opportunity to appeal prior to any redistribution of the funds.  \n25  / / /  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   12  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 14 of 68\n \n1  D.

The Unleashing American Energy Executive Order  \n2  107.  On January 20, 2025, the President issued an executive order entitled \n3  Unleashing American Energy. Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353.  \n4  108.  In the Executive Order, the President declared it “the policy of the United States \n5  to ‘eliminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate’ and promote true consumer choice, which is \n6  essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor \n7  vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by \n8  terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-\n9  powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-\n10  conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and \n11  effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities \n12  alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable.” Id.  \n13  109.  To “[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal,” and effectuate his own policy priorities, \n14  including the “eliminat[ion of] the electric vehicle (EV) mandate,” the President ordered all \n15  agencies to “immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through . . . [IIJA], \n16  including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through \n17  the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program.” Id. at 8357.  \n18  110.  The President further directed all agencies to “review their processes, policies, \n19  and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such \n20  appropriated funds for consistency with the law and [the President’s energy policy priorities] \n21  outlined in section 2 of the [Executive Order].” Id. \n22  111.  The President also ordered agency heads to submit to the Directors of OMB and \n23  the National Economic Council (“NEC”) a report detailing the agencies’ review, including \n24  “recommendations to enhance their alignment with [the President’s energy policy priorities] \n25  set forth in section 2.” The President made clear that agencies were not to disburse any funds \n26  appropriated under the IIJA “until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   21  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 23 of 68\n \n1  Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review \n2  recommendations they have chosen to adopt.” Id.  \n3  112.  In short, the President directed agencies to withhold congressionally \n4  appropriated funds, including NEVI Formula Program funds, as a tool to terminate programs \n5  the President dislikes.  \n6  113.  But agencies have no authority to rescind or revise statutes, or to withhold funds \n7  duly appropriated by Congress based on the President’s disagreement with the policies and \n8  priorities of Congress.  \n9  114.  Indeed, several federal district courts have already enjoined agency actions \n10  effectuating the President’s directive to withhold IIJA and IRA funds as ultra vires, contrary to \n11  law, and arbitrary and capricious.

The Federal Highway Administration Implemented the President’s Directive by \nRetroactively and Unlawfully Revoking All State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n18  Deployment Plan Approvals \n19  115.  Consistent with the President’s directive to illegally withhold all IIJA funding, \n20  including NEVI Formula Program funds, on February 6, 2025, the FHWA informed States that \n21  the current NEVI Formula Program Guidance and all prior versions were rescinded. A true and \n22  accurate copy of the FHWA Letter is attached hereto as Exhibit D.  \n23  116.  The FHWA gave no rationale for rescinding the NEVI Formula Program \n24  Guidance, other than stating that the “new leadership” at the U.S. DOT had “decided to review \n25  the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program.” \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   22  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 24 of 68\n \n1  117.  The FHWA Letter further stated that the “FHWA is updating the NEVI Formula \n2  Program Guidance to align with current U.S. DOT policy and priorities, including those set \n3  forth in DOT Order 2100.7.” A true and accurate copy of DOT Order 2100.7 is attached hereto \n4  as Exhibit E. \n5  118.  Unlike the factors Congress enumerated in the IIJA to inform the Secretary’s \n6  development of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, such as “the distance between publicly \n7  available electric vehicle charging infrastructure,” “connections to the electric grid,” and \n8  “long-term operation and maintenance,” 135 Stat. at 1423, DOT Order 2100.7 requires the \n9  U.S. DOT—and therefore the FHWA—to, for example, “prioritize projects and goals \n10  that . . . give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national \n11  average . . . .” \n12  119.  In the FHWA Letter, the FHWA suggests that it “aims to have [an] updated \n13  draft NEVI Formula Guidance published for public comment in the spring.” The Agency states \n14  it will, at some unknown date, after the close of a public comment period of unknown length \n15  “publish updated final NEVI Formula Guidance that responds to comments received.”  \n16  120.  Without citing any legal authority, the FHWA further explains that “[a]s a result \n17  of the rescission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, [the] FHWA is also immediately \n18  suspending the approval of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment [P]lans for all \n19  fiscal years. Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI \n20  Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new \n21  State [P]lans are submitted and approved.” \n22  121.  By announcing that the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance—if it \n23  ever comes—will include “[i]nstructions for the submission of new State [P]lans for all fiscal \n24  years,” the FHWA made clear it has no intention of reapproving any previously approved plan. \n25  The FHWA’s so-called “suspension” is therefore a revocation of all prior State Plan approvals. \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 25 of 68\n \n1  122.  The FHWA’s actions are consistent with multiple executive orders that \n2  demonstrate that this Administration’s policy goals conflict with the NEVI Formula Program \n3  itself, and the recission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance represents mere pretext for \n4  the FHWA’s real objective—implementing the President’s directive to illegally withhold \n5  NEVI Formula Program funds. \n6  123.  In the Executive Order, the President declared it the policy of the United States \n7  to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate,” including, in the words of the order, any \n8  “unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor \n9  EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, \n10  90 Fed. Reg. at 8353. The President’s explicit directive to withhold funds “for electric vehicle \n11  charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula \n12  Program” indicates he considers federal assistance for the construction of EV charging \n13  infrastructure—despite that being Congress’s express objective—to represent one such \n14  “market distortion.” The President’s anti-EV pronouncements likewise include his declaration \n15  of an unfounded national “energy emergency,” announcing the Administration’s focus on \n16  prioritizing and maximizing the nation’s use of fossil fuels, Exec. Order No. 14,156, 90 Fed. \n17  Reg. 8433 (Jan. 29, 2025), and his denouncement of state policies that “burden[]” the “use” of \n18  domestic oil resources in the Protecting American Energy from State Overreach executive \n19  order, Exec. Order No. 14,260, 90 Fed. Reg 15513 (Apr 14, 2025). \n20  124.  The President directed the FHWA to unlawfully withhold funds for “electric \n21  vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n22  Formula Program.” Exec. Order No. 14,154, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357. The FHWA lacks authority \n23  under the IIJA to withhold NEVI Formula Program funds from States except in the exclusive \n24  circumstances expressly set forth by Congress in the IIJA. It thus contrived a way to implement \n25  the President’s directive—in direct conflict with the statute and without lawful and reasoned \n26  explanation for its actions.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   24  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 26 of 68\n \n1  G.  Unlawfully Revoking All State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \nApproval Harms Plaintiff States \n2 \n3  125.  The FHWA’s retroactive and unlawful revocation of all State Electric Vehicle \n4  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and illegal withholding or withdrawing of statutorily \n5  appropriated and apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds “made available to [a State] for \n6  obligation” has harmed and will continue to harm Plaintiff States and their residents in myriad \n7  ways.  \n8  126.  In total, the FHWA is withholding approximately $2.74 billion of the $3.27 \n9  million in NEVI Formula Program funds available to the States for obligation for fiscal years \n10  2022 through 2025. Collectively, Plaintiff States have been immediately and indefinitely \n11  deprived of access to approximately $1 billion in available NEVI Formula Program funds for \n12  those four fiscal years. \n13  Washington \n14  127.  Washington, through the WSDOT, was apportioned under the NEVI Formula \n15  an approximate total of $71 million in funds over five years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI \n16  Formula Program. Washington’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 \n17  through 2025 (approximately $55 million) were made available to Washington to obligate \n18  upon FHWA approval of Washington’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \n19  covering those fiscal years.  \n20  128.  Washington is a national leader in electric vehicles, remaining in the top five for \n21  EV adoption for more than a decade. The State has proactively invested in EV charging \n22  infrastructure for many years to reduce the environmental effects of the transportation sector. \n23  129.  Transportation is the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington, \n24  contributing approximately twenty-two percent (22%) of total air pollution and thirty-nine \n25  percent (39%) of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions throughout the State.

To help combat climate change and protect the health and welfare of its \n4  residents, Washington has adopted zero-emission vehicle standards that require a percentage of \n5  the vehicles sold in Washington to be zero emissions, starting with the 2025 model year. The \n6  State has also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards, which increases zero \n7  emissions vehicle sales of passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles to one-\n8  hundred percent (100%) by 2035. \n9  131.  In response to the FHWA’s unlawful revocation of its State Electric Vehicle \n10  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and its unlawful withholding of NEVI Formula \n11  Program funds to implement the President’s directive, Washington was forced to cease work \n12  related to the NEVI Formula Program.  \n13  132.  In October 2024, WSDOT issued a notice of funding opportunity (“NOFO”) \n14  and request for proposals (“RFP”) for up to $25 million in projects funded through the NEVI \n15  Formula Program for EV charging infrastructure along five key corridors (I-90, US-97, US-2, \n16  US-195, and US-395). The NOFO/RFP closed on January 31, 2025. WSDOT received 40 \n17  proposals but because Washington does not have funds to cover these projects in the absence \n18  of its share of the NEVI Formula Program funding, the State has not been able to select a \n19  single awardee.  \n20  133.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, the State of Washington has been \n21  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $55 million if its available \n22  NEVI Formula Program funds that Congress expressly directed toward to the State to build out \n23  its EV charging infrastructure. All current and future NEVI Formula Program NOFOs, RFPs, \n24  and all proposed EV charging infrastructure projects in Washington are therefore on hold \n25  indefinitely. The FHWA’s unlawful actions thus create costly delays in project implementation  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   26  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 28 of 68\n \n1  and erode industry confidence in Washington’s ability to fund EV charging infrastructure \n2  projects, which will hamper the State’s ability to find project partners in the future.  \n3  134.  The FHWA’s unlawful actions to revoke Washington’s State Electric Vehicle \n4  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and withhold the State’s share of available NEVI \n5  Formula Program funds significantly impede Washington’s ability to develop a statewide \n6  network of EV charging infrastructure. Widespread, publicly accessible, and reliable EV \n7  charging infrastructure is critical to promote EV adoption and ensure the success of \n8  Washington’s clean car programs, which aim to improve air quality and combat climate change \n9  to protect the health and the welfare of its residents. \n10  California \n11  135.  California, through Caltrans, was apportioned a total of approximately $384 \n12  million in funds over five fiscal years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. \n13  California’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 \n14  (approximately $302 million) was made available to California to obligate upon the FHWA’s \n15  approval of California’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those \n16  fiscal years. \n17  136.  Caltrans and CEC jointly implement the State’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n18  Deployment Plans to support California’s environmental, public health, and transportation \n19  policies. California’s efforts to promote the widespread adoption of zero-emitting EVs are \n20  critical to its Climate Change Scoping Plan, developed to meet the California Legislature’s \n21  GHG reduction targets, and its attainment of federal ambient air quality standards, which \n22  require significant measures to reduce smog precursors like nitrogen oxides and particulate \n23  matter. Failure to attain and maintain these ambient concentrations not only increases the \n24  public health risks, including cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, it also risks \n25  noncompliance penalties to the State, including the loss of highway funds. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7409, \n26  7410, 7509(b); 89 Fed.

Reg. 17,226, 17,232-46 (Apr. 18, 2018) (health effects of nitrogen \n2  oxides). \n3  137.  Under California’s Assembly Bill 118, which created the Clean Transportation \n4  Program administered by CEC, CEC prepares an annual Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure \n5  Plan setting forth the State’s goals for the charging and fueling infrastructure for zero-emission \n6  vehicles (including EVs) that will support the State’s climate and air pollution policies, and \n7  CEC’s strategies for building out that infrastructure. In the 2024 Zero-Emission Vehicle \n8  Infrastructure Plan, CEC projected 7.1 million plug-in passenger EVs in California in 2030 and \n9  15.2 million in 2035.  \n10  138.  The EV charging infrastructure needed to support California drivers is \n11  significant. Fast charging is particularly important along long-distance travel corridors, where \n12  drivers place a premium on quickly recharging their vehicles for the next leg of their journey. \n13  California’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans and its Zero-Emission \n14  Vehicle Infrastructure Plans thus focus NEVI Formula Program funds on building out a \n15  statewide network of fast charging ports along major travel corridors. CEC estimates that \n16  NEVI Formula Program funds will support the deployment of roughly 7,500 charging ports by \n17  2030.  \n18  139.  These fast charging ports serve a demand for EV charging infrastructure that \n19  would otherwise have to be met by a substantially larger number of slower Level 2 charging \n20  ports. A 2023 modeling analysis showed that if California builds out 63,000 additional fast \n21  charging ports, 400,000 fewer Level 2 charging ports are needed to meet the State’s EV \n22  demand by 2030. Without its share of NEVI Formula Program funds, the success of \n23  California’s zero-emission transportation policies will be seriously impeded, and California \n24  will be forced to identify other, less cost-effective funding sources. \n25  140.  In October 2023, CEC opened its first solicitation for NEVI Formula Program \n26  funded projects in California. That first solicitation closed in September 2024 with awards \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   28  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 30 of 68\n \n1  totaling $36.6 million to fund projects along the State’s busiest transportation corridors. Most \n2  of the awards from that solicitation have been finalized in award agreements executed between \n3  CEC and the awardees. A second solicitation closed in March 2025, and application evaluation \n4  is underway. A third round of solicitation is slated to open later this year. \n5  141.  EV charging infrastructure projects funded through the NEVI Formula Program \n6  in California generally proceed in three phases: “preliminary engineering,” “right of way,” and \n7  “construction.” Several California awardees from the first NEVI Formula Program solicitation \n8  are ready to move into their construction phases; others are proceeding with environmental \n9  reviews and obtaining necessary rights of way. These awardees have expressed concern to \n10  Caltrans and CEC that the actions announced in the FHWA Letter will prevent them from \n11  being reimbursed for their costs, and they have therefore delayed proceeding with construction. \n12  142.  One awardee has requested to withdraw its project because the FHWA is \n13  withholding NEVI Formula Program funding. If the awardee withdraws, the charging project it \n14  proposed will be delayed significantly, if not abandoned altogether. \n15  143.  Another awardee reported to CEC that it had letters of intent or memoranda of \n16  understanding with several site hosts—i.e., locations where the awardee could build a charging \n17  station—but those site hosts decided not to enter into site host agreements once they learned \n18  the FHWA was withholding California’s NEVI Formula Program funds. This too will result in \n19  the delay or possible failure of that project. \n20  144.  The withholding of NEVI Formula Program funds threatens the successful \n21  execution of grant agreements with the awardees of California’s second solicitation and will \n22  likely result in potential applicants declining to participate in the third solicitation at all. \n23  145.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful revocation of State Electric Vehicle \n24  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and illegal withholding of NEVI Formula Program \n25  funds, California has been immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   29  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 31 of 68\n \n1  $300 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds that Congress expressly directed \n2  toward to the State to build out its EV charging infrastructure. \n3  146.  The FHWA confirmed the effect of its action in denying Caltrans’s request to \n4  obligate funds for construction of a charging station in San Diego. In an email dated March 31, \n5  2025, the FHWA notified Caltrans that “[a]s a result of the February 6[th] [NEVI Notice],” “no \n6  funds are available for obligation.” A true and accurate copy of this email is attached hereto as \n7  Exhibit F. \n8  Colorado \n9  147.  Colorado, through CDOT, was apportioned approximately $57 million in funds \n10  over five years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. Colorado’s annual shares \n11  of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 were made available to \n12  Colorado to obligate upon FHWA approval of Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n13  Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. CEO has contracted with CDOT to implement \n14  projects for the first four fiscal years of apportioned funding, representing approximately $44.5 \n15  million. \n16  148.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s approval of its Plans, which, consistent with \n17  the IIJA, NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the FHWA’s representations, made NEVI \n18  Formula Program funds available for obligation until expended, Colorado has awarded \n19  approximately $33 million for approved projects. It has contractual obligations with awardees \n20  for $18 million. However, the FHWA has only distributed $8 million in NEVI Formula \n21  Program funds to Colorado. The FHWA is now unlawfully and indefinitely withholding \n22  Colorado’s remaining NEVI Program Formula funds on the basis of its illegal revocation of \n23  Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals. \n24  149.  Colorado has long supported the deployment of EVs and other zero-emission \n25  vehicles (ZEVs) across multiple vehicle classes as a means of reducing the environmental \n26  effects of the transportation sector and achieving its State GHG reduction targets. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   30  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 32 of 68\n \n1  150.  Widespread EV adoption is limited by the availability of publicly accessible EV \n2  charging ports. As a result, Colorado State agencies, local governments, nonprofits, and the \n3  private sector have been collaborating to fund, construct, and operate more than 1,500 Level 2 \n4  and fast charging ports across the State over the past decade. Colorado intended to utilize the \n5  additional funding appropriated by Congress and apportioned to the States under the NEVI \n6  Formula Program to deploy EV charging infrastructure in the gaps remaining in its charging \n7  station network, including in rural and other underserved communities. Colorado also intended \n8  to upgrade existing charging ports in need of greater capacity and address the growing demand \n9  for charging in parts of the State that already see higher EV adoption and usage. Finally, \n10  Colorado expected to use its share of NEVI Formula Program funding to help lay the \n11  groundwork for future charging projects focused on medium- and heavy-duty commercial \n12  users. \n13  151.  The FHWA’s unlawful actions to revoke Colorado’s State Electric Vehicle \n14  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and its unlawful withholding of NEVI Formula \n15  Program funds significantly impedes Colorado’s ability to develop a statewide network of EV \n16  charging stations. Such a network is necessary to promote EV adoption as required by \n17  Colorado’s legislature and executive branch, which have enacted ambitious emissions \n18  reduction goals for the transportation sector. The FHWA’s unlawful actions interfere with \n19  existing projects, and sow uncertainty that undermines confidence in Colorado’s ability to fund \n20  EV charging infrastructure projects and creates costly delays in project implementation.   \n21  Arizona \n22  152.  Arizona, through ADOT, was apportioned an approximate total of $76 million \n23  over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. Arizona’s shares of \n24  NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $60 million) \n25  were made available to Arizona to obligate upon FHWA’s approval of Arizona’s State Electric \n26  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   31  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 33 of 68\n \n1  153.  Transportation was the single largest contributing factor to GHG emissions in \n2  Arizona in 2021. As a result, Arizona has prioritized public fleet electrification and developing \n3  publicly available EV charging infrastructure. These two initiatives are estimated to reduce \n4  cumulative GHG emissions by almost 3 million metric tons between 2025 and 2050. Funding \n5  from the NEVI Formula Program is critical to achieving these emission-reduction goals. \n6  154.  On January 19, 2025, ADOT issued a solicitation for 35 prospective EV \n7  charging station locations identified in its 2023 and 2024 State Plans. ADOT spent a \n8  significant amount of funds and staff time preparing this solicitation, which it had to cancel \n9  after the FHWA announced its unlawful actions.  \n10  155.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Arizona has been immediately and \n11  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $48 million of its available NEVI Formula \n12  Program funds. \n13  District of Columbia \n14  156.  The District of Columbia, through DDOT, was apportioned approximately \n15  $16.7 million over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. The \n16  District’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 \n17  (approximately $13 million) were made available to the District to obligate upon FHWA’s \n18  approval of the District’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those \n19  fiscal years.  \n20  157.  The District acted in reliance on the FHWA complying with the IIJA to obligate \n21  and disburse the District’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds to build a robust, reliable, \n22  and interconnected charging network across all eight District Wards to promote EV adoption.  \n23  158.  Specifically, DDOT planned to build out a reliable network of NEVI Formula \n24  Program compliant fast charging stations, to install at least one fast charging station in each \n25  Ward, and to have a robust stakeholder and public engagement to help identify additional \n26  regional priorities and how best to use any remaining NEVI Formula Program funds.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 34 of 68\n \n1  159.  As a direct result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, the District has been \n2  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $9.5 million of its available \n3  NEVI Formula Program funds, and its ability to develop a District-wide network of EV \n4  charging stations and help support develop a local workforce with experience in EV charging \n5  infrastructure installation, maintenance, and repair has been significantly impeded. \n6  Delaware \n7  160.  The transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in Delaware. \n8  One of the commitments of Delaware’s Climate Action Plan is to minimize transportation \n9  related emissions and transition to vehicles reliant on clean and renewable energy. This goal, \n10  along with federal investment in EVs and their charging stations, will increase Delaware’s \n11  resiliency to the damaging environmental effects of climate change, reduce harmful emissions, \n12  and create a network of accessible EV charging infrastructure that is accessible to everyone in \n13  the State. \n14  161.  Delaware’s General Assembly has enacted statutory provisions for sharing State \n15  vehicle charging infrastructure, 29 Del. C. Section 8062, an electric vehicle rebate program, \n16  Section 8064, and incentives to residential users to install chargers, Section 8065.  \n17  162.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Delaware has been immediately \n18  and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $3.8 million of its available NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds and its ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations \n20  has been seriously impeded. \n21  Hawaiʻi \n22  163.  Hawaiʻi, through Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation, (“HDOT”), was \n23  apportioned approximately $18 million over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula \n24  Program’s goals.  \n25  164.  Hawai‘i has long been a leader in EV adoption, which is essential to reducing \n26  GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. For example, charging sessions at the \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   33  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 35 of 68\n \n1  Kahului station and Aloha Tower station—built using NEVI Formula Program funds—\n2  providing approximately 806,912 kWh roughly translates to a reduction of nearly 528,000 \n3  kilograms of GHGs omitted into the atmosphere. That amount of GHG emission reduction is \n4  equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 14,600 trees.  \n5  165.  Hawaiʻi relies on the NEVI Formula Program funds apportioned to the State to \n6  help transition to a sustainable transportation future and meet the State’s renewable energy \n7  goals by increasing availability of fast, affordable, and dependable EV charging.  \n8  166.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Hawaiʻi has been immediately and \n9  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $2 million of its available NEVI Formula \n10  Program funds and its ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations has been \n11  significantly impeded. \n12  Illinois \n13  167.  Illinois’s State Plans detail the State’s approach to expending its total share of \n14  the NEVI Formula Program funds to build out an EV charging network in service of the State’s \n15  goal of one million EVs on the road by 2030. 20 ILCS 627/45(a)(1). \n16  168.  Through IDOT, Illinois has contractual obligations for $25.4 million for \n17  approved NEVI Formula Program funded projects. IDOT is currently evaluating applications \n18  from a NOFO that closed on January 31, 2025, and intends to award up to $24 million to \n19  complete build out of EV charging infrastructure along Illinois’s AFCs. Additionally, IDOT is \n20  in final negotiations with a consultant to assist with construction oversight of awarded and \n21  obligated NEVI Formula Program funded projects. To pay for these consultant services and \n22  proceed with EV charging infrastructure projects, IDOT will need to obligate additional NEVI \n23  Formula Program funds, which the FHWA is unlawfully withholding. \n24  169.  Consistent with the IIJA and the FHWA’s representations, IDOT has acted in \n25  reliance on NEVI Formula Program funding to cover contractual obligations related to EV \n26  charging infrastructure projects. Illinois does not have funds to cover these projects in the \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   34  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 36 of 68\n \n1  absence of its share of the NEVI Formula Program funding. To date, the FHWA has not \n2  distributed any NEVI Formula Program funds to IDOT. \n3  Kentucky \n4  170.  Kentucky, through KYTC, was apportioned approximately $69 million over \n5  five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. Kentucky’s share of NEVI \n6  Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $55 million) were \n7  made available to Kentucky to obligate upon FHWA approval of Kentucky’s State Electric \n8  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. \n9  171.  Kentucky’s implementation of its State Plans through KYTC consisted of \n10  competitive processes to identify and select qualified Developer Teams to design, build, \n11  operate, and maintain EV charging stations across the state along AFCs to build out a reliable \n12  functioning EV charging network. By way of FHWA-approved Requests for Proposals, KYTC \n13  received hundreds of proposals and has active contracts with Developer Teams for 47 EV \n14  charging station sites totaling $32,189,011. An additional Request for Proposals intended to \n15  complete the NEVI-required “build-out” of the AFC was scheduled to be released in February \n16  2025. \n17  172.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Kentucky has been immediately \n18  and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $18 million of its available NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds, and its ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations \n20  has been significantly impeded. \n21  173.  The illegal withholding of these funds has rendered Kentucky unable to obligate \n22  the necessary funding to administer and oversee its active contracts. Already obligated funding \n23  cannot be adjusted to include Construction Engineering and Inspection costs due to FHWA’s \n24  restriction on obligations, hindering KYTC’s ability to effectively manage the EV charging \n25  stations’ development and operations. The revocation of the remaining apportioned funding \n26  risks interruption of all construction activities and/or operations of these EV charging stations. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   35  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 37 of 68\n \n1  Maryland \n2  174.  In 2020, transportation was the source of over one third of Maryland’s GHG \n3  emissions and a significant source of the air pollutants that form smog. Maryland is committed \n4  to increasing registrations of EVs to address these pollution issues and the State has seen \n5  tremendous growth in the number of registered EVs over the past five years from 14,930 EVs \n6  in 2020 to 132,973 EVs to date in 2025—an increase of 891 percent (891%). The State \n7  envisions further growth in EV adoption over the next decade with a goal of registering  \n8  1.1 million passenger EVs by 2031 and the implementation of the State’s Advanced Clean \n9  Cars II regulation. \n10  175.  Maryland was apportioned approximately $69 million in NEVI Formula \n11  Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 and roughly $49 million of those funds were \n12  available for obligation to Maryland upon the FHWA’s approval of Maryland’s State Electric \n13  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering fiscal years 2022 through 2025. These funds \n14  would go towards completing the buildout of fast charging infrastructure along Maryland’s \n15  designated AFCs before building out Level 2 charging infrastructure in areas of the State \n16  without such infrastructure. \n17  176.  The FHWA previously authorized the obligation of approximately $14.5 million \n18  of NEVI Formula Program funds for Round 1 design-build procurement and administration, as \n19  designated in Maryland’s State Plans. Those funds will support the construction of public \n20  charging infrastructure at only 22 of the 50 sites needed to complete the State’s AFCs. \n21  177.  On December 17, 2024, MSHA launched its Round 2 procurement and \n22  simultaneously requested that the FHWA authorize the obligation of $475,000 to support \n23  Round 2. MSHA’s December 17, 2024, RFP was originally slated to close on March 26, 2025.  \n24  178.  As a result, however, of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Maryland has been \n25  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $34.5 million of its available \n26  NEVI Formula Program funds and the State has been forced to delay the deadline for Round 2 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   36  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 38 of 68\n \n1  proposal submissions. Based on Round 1 procurement data and available market estimates, \n2  MSHA estimates that the FHWA’s withholding of its remaining NEVI Formula Program funds \n3  would jeopardize the buildout of 180 additional fast charging ports along AFCs and 1,611 \n4  additional Level 2 charging ports in Maryland communities.8 \n5  179.  The delay in Round 2 procurement is also expected to increase costs to build \n6  charging infrastructure at the 29 sites targeted by that procurement. This increase in cost will \n7  necessarily reduce the total number of charging ports that can be built at sites away from \n8  AFCs. And this reduction in charging infrastructure may, in turn, lead to reduced adoption of \n9  EVs in the State, harming Maryland’s ability to meet its emission reduction goals and \n10  implement its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation.  \n11  Michigan \n12  180.   Michigan, through MDOT, was apportioned approximately $110 million over \n13  five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program’s goals. Michigan’s shares of NEVI \n14  Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $87 million) were \n15  made available to Michigan to obligate upon approval of Michigan’s State Electric Vehicle \n16  Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. \n17  181.  FHWA previously authorized the obligation of approximately $58 million of \n18  MDOT’s apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds.   \n19  182.  MDOT used these obligated funds to carry out its State Plans and the purposes \n20  of the NEVI Formula Program by putting out its Round 1 Request for Proposals on August 31, \n21  2023, seeking proposals for the installation of up to 43 NEVI charging stations in Michigan. \n22  MDOT has entered into approximately 26 contracts and intends to enter into up to 8 additional \n23  contracts as the result of its Round 1 solicitation. \n24  / / / \n \n25 \n8 This MSHA estimate of fast charging and Level 2 charging ports includes infrastructure planned for \ndevelopment using the funds the FHWA is currently withholding unlawfully and Maryland’s apportioned share of \n26 \nfunds for fiscal year 2026.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   37  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 39 of 68\n \n1  183.  MDOT issued a Round 2 Request for Proposals on November 20, 2024, seeking \n2  proposals for the installation of up to 48 NEVI charging stations. MDOT has announced \n3  selections for Round 2 and is currently working toward contract execution for the selected \n4  vendors.   \n5  184.  However, as a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Michigan has been \n6  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $29 million of its available \n7  NEVI Formula Program funds, which the State intends to use to support a Round 3 solicitation \n8  to install up to an additional 65 EV charging stations.  \n9  185.  The loss of its NEVI Formula Program funds will significantly impede \n10  MDOT’s ability to develop a statewide network of EV charging stations.     \n11  Minnesota \n12  186.  Transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions in Minnesota. The State \n13  is seeing more frequent extreme weather events, drought, smoke from forest fires and potential \n14  loss of several species due to warming rivers and lakes as a result of climate change. To \n15  mitigate the damaging effects of climate change, MnDOT set interim GHG emissions targets in \n16  the Statewide Multimodal Transportation Plan for 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040. The Minnesota \n17  legislature updated the State goal to include interim targets, which align with the Statewide \n18  Multimodal Transportation Plan and the State’s Climate Action Framework. Minnesota’s Next \n19  Generation Energy Act of 2007, Minnesota Statutes, section 216H.02 requires Minnesota to \n20  reduce GHG emissions statewide to net zero by 2050. \n21  187.  To decrease transportation sector GHG emissions, Minnesota needs to invest in \n22  a range of strategies, including vehicle electrification, increasing travel options, and low \n23  carbon infrastructure and systems management. The State identified increased EV adoption as \n24  one way to reduce GHG emissions from transportation. A reliable statewide EV charging \n25  network is required to help alleviate Minnesota residents’ range anxiety and encourage  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   38  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 40 of 68\n \n1  EV adoption. The FHWA’s unlawful actions jeopardize Minnesota’s ability to reduce GHG \n2  emissions from transportation and ultimately put its climate change mitigation goals at risk. \n3  188.   In reliance on the FHWA’s compliance with the IIJA, MnDOT included NEVI \n4  Formula Program funds as a set-aside in its State Transportation Improvement Program \n5  (“STIP”). The 2025-2028 STIP includes the entire $68 million in funds apportioned to \n6  Minnesota under the NEVI Formula Program. When individual projects are identified, funds \n7  are broken out from the set-aside, reviewed through Metropolitan Planning Organization \n8  (“MPO”) processes, and modified in local Transportation Improvement Plans and the STIP, \n9  before federal obligation. \n10  189.  As of January 10, 2025, the FHWA had authorized obligation of NEVI Formula \n11  Program funds for 19 projects in Minnesota. A Round 1 RFP was opened December 2023 and \n12  closed April 2024. Round 1 resulted in 12 executed contracts to build 12 EV charging stations. \n13  Work on these projects is continuing.  \n14  190.  A Round 2 RFP was opened October 2024 and closed January 2025. In April \n15  2025, MnDOT awarded an additional 12 conditional awards to build an additional 12 EV \n16  charging stations. MnDOT is taking steps towards executing contracts for these projects, which \n17  will result in a total of 24 fully executed contracts in summer 2025.  \n18  191.  As stated previously, the FHWA has only obligated funds for 19 of these 24 \n19  projects.  \n20  192.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful action, which the Agency announced just \n21  before the MPO process for the five Round 2 projects without authorized obligations was \n22  complete, Minnesota cancelled those processes. To fulfill MnDOT’s commitment to \n23  encouraging EV use as a means to combat climate change, State funds were identified to move \n24  forward with Round 2 conditional awards. \n25  193.  However, Minnesota’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Needs Assessment, which \n26  resulted in the identification of future EV charging infrastructure projects throughout \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   39  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 41 of 68\n \n1  Minnesota, was completed in reliance on the State receiving its entire share of NEVI Formula \n2  Program funds—all $68 million. These projects are on hold.  \n3  194.  In addition, the majority of work to establish replicable and accountable \n4  frameworks for procurement and implementation of the NEVI Formula Program has already \n5  been done. The next step is to construct the tangible benefits for the public. Should any one of \n6  the three partners (federal, state, or awardee) back out at this time, it will have been a \n7  considerable waste of public and private resources and the benefits of a reliable statewide \n8  network of EV charging infrastructure will not be realized. \n9  New Jersey \n10  195.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, New Jersey has been immediately \n11  and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $73 million of its available NEVI \n12  Formula Program funds.  \n13  196.  Relying on the FHWA’s statutory obligation to disburse NEVI Formula \n14  Program funds, the Agency’s approval of New Jersey’s State Plans, and its prior \n15  authorizations, NJDOT awarded in December 2024 a publicly advertised contract for the \n16  development, planning, design, installation, five-year operation, and maintenance of 76 NEVI \n17  Formula Program compliant EV charging stations along 19 designated AFCs. \n18  197.  In the absence of the NEVI Formula Program funds the FHWA is unlawfully \n19  withholding, NJDOT cannot move forward with this initiative, and New Jersey is impeded \n20  from meeting its EV charging infrastructure goals, which are aimed at reducing environmental \n21  harms stemming from the transportation sector. \n22  New Mexico \n23  198.  The NEVI Formula Program joined numerous other climate action efforts \n24  occurring in New Mexico. In January 2019, New Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham signed \n25  Executive Order (EO) 2019-003, announcing New Mexico will continue to support the 2015 \n26  Paris Agreement goals and setting a statewide goal to reduce GHG emissions by at least forty-\n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   40  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 42 of 68\n \n1  five percent (45%) by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. EO 2019-003 also created the Interagency \n2  Climate Change Task Force (“CCTF”) to direct the efforts of multiple state agencies to reduce \n3  GHG emissions, improve air quality, and protect natural resources.  \n4  199.  The CCTF established ten interagency Climate Action Teams to propose, plan, \n5  and implement strategies. The CCTF has identified transportation decarbonization, including \n6  electrification, as key to reaching state GHG reduction goals. State agencies, including \n7  NMDOT, have been working together to advance decarbonization strategies, and recent \n8  successes include the May 2022 adoption of a Clean Cars Rule.  \n9  200.  As a member of the CCTF and in support of statewide goals, NMDOT is also \n10  actively working to build a climate action program that includes resiliency planning, \n11  developing carbon reduction strategies, implementing multimodal plans, and updating facilities \n12  with energy efficiency technologies and solar.  \n13  201.  The deployment of EVs and EV charging infrastructure in New Mexico will \n14  improve quality of life across the State by reducing GHG emissions and air pollution.  \n15  202.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, New Mexico has been \n16  immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $18.5 million of its available \n17  NEVI Formula Program funds. Without that funding, New Mexico’s carefully planned efforts \n18  to build a network of EV charging infrastructure across the State to ensure all residents have \n19  the ability to choose an EV will be wasted and the State is unlikely to achieve its goal of \n20  building a future transportation system that serves all its people, including those in \n21  disadvantaged communities.  \n22  New York \n23  203.  New York, through NYSDOT was apportioned a total of approximately $175.5 \n24  million in funds over five fiscal years (fiscal years 2022 through 2026) dedicated to carrying \n25  out the NEVI Formula Program. New York’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal \n26  years 2022 through 2025 (approximately $138 million) was made available to New York to \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   41  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 43 of 68\n \n1  obligate upon the FHWA’s approval of New York’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure \n2  Deployment Plans covering those first four fiscal years. \n3  204.  NYSDOT engaged the Power Authority of New York to perform the first set of \n4  NEVI Formula Program funded projects in New York. That procurement concluded on \n5  September 8, 2023, wherein NYSDOT obligated $16.1 million to fund 23 initial projects along \n6  some of the State’s busiest transportation corridors. Eleven stations are operational and the \n7  remaining 12 stations are in development.  \n8  205.  NYSDOT also engaged the New York State Energy Research and Development \n9  Authority (“NYSERDA”) to conduct two solicitations for the next stage of NEVI Formula \n10  Program funded projects in New York.  \n11  206.  NYSERDA issued its first competitive solicitation, Program Opportunity Notice \n12  (“PON”) 5865, in September 2024 calling for proposals to develop fast charging stations along \n13  designated AFCs in New York with a focus on areas north of and including I-84. PON 5865 \n14  made $21.5 million in NEVI Formula Program funds available to proposers. Proposals in \n15  response to PON 5865 were received by December 4, 2024. NYSERDA’s evaluation of PON \n16  5865 proposals is complete. \n17  207.  In December 2024, NYSERDA issued a second solicitation for NEVI Formula \n18  Program funded fast charging station proposals, PON 5866, which focused on the areas around \n19  New York City, Long Island, and the lower Hudson Valley. PON 5866 made $28.5 million in \n20  NEVI Formula Program funds available to proposers. Proposals in response to PON 5866 were \n21  received by March 18, 2025. NYSERDA’s evaluation of PON 5866 proposals is in progress.  \n22  208.  On or about April 28, 2025, NYSDOT reviewed its unobligated NEVI Formula \n23  Program fund balance—estimated to be approximately $120 million for fiscal years 2022 \n24  through 2025 as NYSDOT had obligated approximately $17.7 million of its apportionment for \n25  those years as of that date—and discovered such funds unavailable for obligation in the FHWA \n26  portal.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   42  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 44 of 68\n \n1  209.  As a direct result of the FHWA’s actions, New York has been immediately and \n2  indefinitely deprived of access to approximately $120 million of its available NEVI Formula \n3  Program funds, NYSDOT and NYSERDA cannot move forward under the two recently issued \n4  PONs, and all future uses of NEVI Formula Program funding are now on hold indefinitely.  \n5  210.  NEVI Formula Program funded EV charging infrastructure projects are critical \n6  to the economy and health of New York by broadening the availability of charging for all \n7  makes and models of EVs, addressing climate change, and protecting the health and welfare of \n8  New York’s residents. \n9  North Carolina \n10  211.  The transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in North \n11  Carolina. North Carolina has made commitments to minimize transportation-related emissions \n12  by encouraging the use of vehicles that rely on clean and renewable energy, including through \n13  Governor Cooper’s Executive Orders 90, 271, and 246, and plans resulting from them, as well \n14  as signing on to the Multi State Medium- and Heavy-Duty ZEV Memorandum. In addition, the \n15  State has passed legislation, House Bill 951 (“Energy Solutions for North Carolina,” \n16  S.L. 2021-165), which provides the North Carolina Utilities Commission authority to facilitate \n17  the build out of electrical vehicle charging infrastructure. \n18  212.  NCDOT and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality have \n19  prioritized (1) electrifying public and state fleets and (2) building a publicly accessible \n20  fast-charging network. To facilitate this, North Carolina’s State Plans are designed to expand \n21  access to convenient, reliable, and affordable electric vehicle charging. \n22  213.  North Carolina, through NCDOT, was apportioned approximately $109 million \n23  in NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022-2026. The first four apportionments \n24  (fiscal years 2022-2025) made roughly $86 million available to obligate. NCDOT released its \n25  NEVI Round 1 Request for Proposals on 11 priority “cluster” sites and issued conditional  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   43  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 45 of 68\n \n1  awards on September 9, 2024; a second cluster map was published on December 4, 2024, in \n2  preparation for Round 2. \n3  214.  As a direct result of FHWA’s unlawful actions, NCDOT could only proceed \n4  with the $5.9 million already tied to nine construction contracts, leaving roughly $103 million \n5  of North Carolina’s apportioned funds (approximately $80 million of which was made \n6  available for NC to obligate) inaccessible forcing NCDOT to pause work on the forthcoming \n7  Round 2 solicitation. \n8  Oregon \n9  215.  Oregon, through ODOT, was apportioned approximately $52 million in funds \n10  over five fiscal years (fiscal years 2022 through 2026) dedicated to carrying out the NEVI \n11  Formula Program. Oregon’s share of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 \n12  through 2025 (approximately $41 million) were made available to Oregon to obligate upon the \n13  FHWA’s approval of Oregon’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans \n14  covering those fiscal years. \n15  216.  For nearly 20 years, Oregon has actively pursued multi-pronged strategies to \n16  reduce harmful GHG emissions in the State. In 2019, the Oregon Legislature passed Senate \n17  Bill 1044, setting specific light-duty vehicle electrification goals for the State. The legislation \n18  established the following goals: 250,000 registered zero-emission vehicles by 2025, over one \n19  million by 2030 (50% of new vehicle sales), and 2.5 million by 2035 (90% of new vehicle \n20  sales). Installing publicly available EV charging stations throughout the State is essential for \n21  Oregon to meet its electrification goals. Oregon has determined it needs 8,000-13,000 public \n22  fast charging ports and 12,000-50,000 public Level 2 charging ports by 2030 to reach its \n23  goals. Oregon planned to use its NEVI Formula Program funds to develop a total of eleven \n24  AFCs, each to contain publicly accessible charging and alternative fueling infrastructure. \n25  217.  ODOT has thus far obligated approximately $26 million of its approximately \n26  $41 million in available NEVI Formula Program funds for planning, preliminary engineering, \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   44  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 46 of 68\n \n1  and construction phases for the installation of EV charging stations in eleven major Oregon \n2  corridors. \n3  218.  As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, ODOT has been immediately and \n4  indefinitely deprived of more than $12 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds. \n5  Without those funds, ODOT cannot develop eight of the eleven corridors, representing a loss \n6  of at least 40 fast charging stations, or a minimum of 160 charging ports. This accounts for \n7  roughly seventy-five percent (75%) of the estimated number of stations ODOT planned to \n8  develop. If the FHWA continues to withhold Oregon’s NEVI Formula Program funds, the \n9  State cannot move forward with the projects described in its State Plans and is highly unlikely \n10  to meet its goals of significantly reducing GHG emissions through transportation \n11  electrification. \n12  Pennsylvania \n13  219.  Pennsylvania, through PennDOT, was apportioned approximately $171.5 million \n14  over five fiscal years to carry out the NEVI Formula Program. Pennsylvania’s share of \n15  congressionally-appropriated and apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds included $25.4 \n16  million for fiscal year 2022 and $36.5 million, annually, for fiscal years 2023 through and \n17  including 2026. \n18  220.  In January 2025, PennDOT had authority to obligate $134.9 million of NEVI \n19  funding. At the time, PennDOT had obligated approximately $77 million to build out its AFC, \n20  leaving a balance of $58 million PennDOT was legally authorized to obligate. \n21  221.  FHWA’s illegal actions have prevented it from accessing $58 million of NEVI \n22  Formula Program funds. \n23  222.  As a direct result of FHWA’s unlawful actions, PennDOT and Governor \n24  Shapiro have been immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to $58 million of \n25  congressionally-appropriated and apportioned funds to carry out their State Plans, and they \n26  have had to incur costs and obligations without knowing whether or when FHWA would honor \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   45  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 47 of 68\n \n1  its legal obligations. Relief is necessary so that PennDOT can carry out its carefully-tailored \n2  State Plans that benefit Pennsylvania residents and meet transportation goals beneficial to those \n3  residents. \n4  Rhode Island \n5  223.  Rhode Island’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans were \n6  designed to establish a reliable, accessible, and interconnected EV fast charging network along \n7  critical transportation corridors, beginning with the designated Alternative Fuel Corridor (I-95) \n8  and expanding statewide. The Plans aimed to reduce range anxiety, promote EV adoption, \n9  support GHG emissions reductions, prioritize investments in disadvantaged communities, and \n10  prepare the State’s workforce and infrastructure for a sustainable, zero-emission transportation \n11  future. Each Plan was sequentially structured to build upon prior progress, moving from AFC \n12  compliance to equitable and sustainable statewide EV infrastructure expansion. \n13  224.  During Phase 1, for AFC buildout, infrastructure was deployed through a \n14  competitive procurement process with a selected vendor. The project was fully completed, all \n15  invoices were paid, and all contractual obligations were fulfilled. No pending invoices, \n16  encumbrances, or outstanding deliverables remain. \n17  225.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s compliance with the IIJA, the State issued a \n18  Phase 2 Request for Applications (RFA) in November 2024 to award $10 million to eligible \n19  public, tribal, higher education, and nonprofit entities. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful \n20  actions, Rhode Island halted the open Phase 2 RFA process.  \n21  226.  Forcing the closure of an active RFA period caused immediate disruption as \n22  many applicants had already initiated or completed their applications. Rhode Island has been \n23  unable to award funds to communities and public entities that invested time and resources \n24  preparing proposals.  \n25  227.  The short- and long-term harms to Rhode Island resulting from the FHWA’s \n26  unlawful actions are significant and numerous. Rhode Island has been immediately and \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   46  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 48 of 68\n \n1  indefinitely deprived of access to more than $16 million of its available NEVI Formula \n2  Program funds.  \n3  228.  Rhode Island is steadfast in its commitment to combat climate change and its \n4  harmful effects. To that end, the 2021 Act on Climate sets aggressive decarbonization \n5  requirements for the State. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-1, et. seq. This includes mandates that \n6  statewide GHG emissions reach forty-five percent (45%) below 1990 levels by 2030; eighty \n7  percent (80%) below 1990 levels by 2040, and that the State achieves net-zero emissions by \n8  2050. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-9. \n9  229.  In furtherance of its climate goals, Rhode Island is also firmly committed to \n10  reducing transportation-sector GHG emissions and advancing transportation electrification as a \n11  critical element of its broader climate strategy. Transportation emissions account for over thirty \n12  percent (30%) of Rhode Island’s total GHG emissions, making it the largest single source of \n13  emissions in the state. Delays in EV infrastructure deployment caused by the FHWA’s \n14  unlawful actions jeopardize the State’s ability to meet its GHG reduction mandates under the \n15  Act on Climate, as well as other regional air quality improvement goals.  \n16  230.  In addition, future EV charging infrastructure projects are likely to face \n17  increased construction, equipment, and labor costs due to inflation and ongoing supply chain \n18  instability.  \n19  231.  The uncertainty caused by the FHWA’s unlawful actions also stands to reduce \n20  the pool of capable partners willing to engage in future solicitations. Moreover, workforce \n21  development efforts, including EV technician training and pipeline programs associated with \n22  Phase 2 of the program in Rhode Island, have been delayed, undermining economic \n23  development opportunities tied to growth of the clean transportation sector. \n24  232.  Reopening or redesigning paused solicitations will also require additional State \n25  resources and will extend project delivery timelines.  \n26  / / / \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   47  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 49 of 68\n \n1  Vermont \n2  233.  Vermont, through VTrans, was apportioned an approximate total of $21 million \n3  in funds over five fiscal years dedicated to carrying out the NEVI Formula Program. \n4  Vermont’s shares of NEVI Formula Program funds for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 were \n5  made available to Vermont to obligate upon the FHWA’s approval of its State Electric Vehicle \n6  Infrastructure Deployment Plans covering those fiscal years. The first four fiscal years of \n7  apportioned funding equaled approximately $16.7 million. \n8  234.  Vermont has long supported the deployment of EVs and other ZEVs across \n9  multiple vehicle classes as a means of reducing the environmental effects of the transportation \n10  sector and achieving its State GHG emissions reduction targets. For example, Vermont’s \n11  Global Warming Solutions Act requires Vermont to significantly reduce GHG emissions \n12  below historic levels in the coming decades, and Vermont has prepared a Climate Action Plan \n13  to identify steps to meet those goals. Development of EV charging infrastructure to support \n14  transportation electrification is a Climate Action Plan priority. \n15  235.  Acting in reliance on the FHWA’s approval of its State Plans, which, consistent \n16  with the IIJA, NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the FHWA’s representations, made \n17  NEVI Formula Program funds available for obligation until expended, Vermont, among other \n18  things, awarded EV fast charging port projects totaling approximately $9.3 million. Without its \n19  NEVI Formula Program funds, Vermont cannot fund all of the projects the State has awarded.  \n20  Wisconsin \n21  236.  In response to the FHWA’s unlawful actions, Wisconsin was forced to cease \n22  work related to 15 NEVI Formula Program awards and a current RFP issued to solicit \n23  proposals for additional NEVI Formula Program funded projects.  \n24  237.  In January 2024, WisDOT issued a NOFO and RFP through the NEVI Formula \n25  Program for charging infrastructure along Wisconsin’s approved AFCs. The NOFO/RFP \n26  closed on May 23, 2024. WisDOT issued 53 awards. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   48  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 50 of 68\n \n1  actions, WisDOT cannot take any further action on 15 of these awards, which represents \n2  approximately $7.3 million. \n3  238.  On October 14, 2024, WisDOT issued a second RFP with the intention of \n4  issuing awards in Spring 2025. As a result of the FHWA’s unlawful actions, WisDOT cannot \n5  issue any awards under this RFP. \n6  239.  WisDOT has been immediately and indefinitely deprived of access to \n7  approximately $62.65 million of its available NEVI Formula Program funds. In the absence of \n8  those funds, WisDOT cannot fund the 15 projects awarded under its January 2024 RFP or issue \n9  any new awards to carry out EV charging infrastructure projects. \n10  240.  NEVI Formula Program funded EV charging infrastructure projects are critical \n11  to the economy and health of Wisconsin by broadening the availability of EV charging for all \n12  makes and models of EVs, which helps address climate change and protects the health and \n13  welfare of Wisconsin’s residents. \n14  241.  Even if the FHWA issues new final NEVI Formula Program Guidance in the \n15  very near future, Plaintiff States will shoulder the unnecessary cost and burden of developing \n16  new State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans despite having invested months \n17  and significant resources developing its previous plans. \n18  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n19 \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – In Excess of Statutory Authority \n20  Revocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n242.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n21 \npreceding paragraphs. \n22 \n243.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n23 \n244.  Under the APA, the court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n24 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \n25 \nlimitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   49  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 51 of 68\n \n1  245.  An agency may not take any action that exceeds the scope of its statutory \n2  authority. \n3  246.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n4  Defendants to suspend or revoke State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n5  approvals, either individually or categorically. \n6  247.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n7  Defendants to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds. \n8  248.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n9  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n10  249.  Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n11  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n12  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds exceed Defendants’ statutory authority and must be \n13  set aside. \n14  250.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n15  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n16  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n17  COUNT II \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious and Not in \n18  Accordance with Law \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n19 \n251.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n20 \npreceding paragraphs. \n21 \n252.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n22 \n253.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n23 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n24 \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n25 \n/ / / \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   50  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 52 of 68\n \n1  254.  Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the action contravenes or \n2  otherwise fails to implement the statutory directives of Congress consistent with the statute’s \n3  text, structure, and purpose. \n4  255.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails to articulate a \n5  reasoned explanation for its action, fails to consider reasonable alternatives, fails to consider \n6  important factors, and/or considers factors Congress did not intend it to consider. Agency \n7  action is also arbitrary and capricious if, when departing from a prior policy, an agency fails to \n8  display awareness it is changing its position, fails to consider serious reliance interests, or fails \n9  to demonstrate that there are good reasons for the new policy, which also must be permissible \n10  under the statute. \n11  256.  Agency action taken on pretextual grounds violates the APA’s requirements of \n12  reasoned agency decision-making. \n13  257.  The Defendants made no factual or legal findings, nor did they provide any \n14  reasoned basis for their actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State Electric Vehicle \n15  Deployment Plan approvals.  \n16  258.  The Defendants’ sole stated rationale for their action to “suspend” or revoke all \n17  State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals—that the recission of the NEVI Formula \n18  Program Guidance necessitated the retroactive and categorical “suspension” or revocation of \n19  all State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals—is a contrived, irrational, and \n20  insufficient explanation and thus not a reasoned basis for the action. \n21  259.  The Defendants failed to consider whether “suspending” or revoking all State \n22  Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals was consistent with the purpose and objectives of \n23  the IIJA and the NEVI Formula Program as established by Congress. \n24  260.   The Defendants failed to engage in reasoned consideration of any individual \n25  State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan before categorically “suspending” or revoking all Plan \n26  approvals and did not provide reasoned explanation for doing so.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   51  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 53 of 68\n \n1  261.  Likewise, Defendants failed to engage in reasoned, individualized consideration \n2  of any State Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan or any actions taken by Plaintiff States to carry \n3  out those Plans before categorically withdrawing or withholding NEVI Formula Program \n4  funds. \n5  262.  The Defendants failed to consider obvious, reasonable, and lawful alternatives \n6  to their actions, such as complying with the requirements of the IIJA and honoring their prior \n7  approval of Plaintiff States’ State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans for fiscal \n8  years 2022 through 2025 while updating NEVI Formula Program Guidance to govern the \n9  submission of fiscal year 2026 Plans. \n10  263.  The Defendants’ stated rationale for their action to “suspend” or revoke all State \n11  Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan approvals and their failure to consider reasonable \n12  alternatives exposes the pretextual nature of the Defendants’ actions. Upon information and \n13  belief—and as a matter of common sense—the Defendants “suspended” or revoked all State \n14  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals to implement the President’s \n15  directive to withhold funds “for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the \n16  National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program . . . .” Exec. Order 14154, 90 Fed. \n17  Reg. at 8357. \n18  264.  The Defendants failed to consider Plaintiff States’ serious reliance interests, \n19  including on the FHWA’s prior approvals of their State Plans and the States’ expectation that \n20  the FHWA would distribute their NEVI Formula Program funds as required.  \n21  265.  The Defendants therefore failed to consider the consequences of categorically \n22  “suspending” or revoking approval of all State Plans and categorically withholding or \n23  withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds.  \n24  266.  The Defendants also failed to demonstrate good reasons for their change in \n25  position and their new position directly conflicts with the IIJA and is therefore impermissible \n26  under the statute. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   52  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 54 of 68\n \n1  267.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n2  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n3  268.  Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n4  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n5  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds must be set aside as arbitrary, capricious, and not \n6  in accordance with law. \n7  269.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n8  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n9  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n10  COUNT III \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – Not in Accordance with Law and \n11 \nWithout Observance of Procedure Required By Law \n12  Withholding of Funds \n270.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n13 \npreceding paragraphs. \n14 \n271.  Each of the Defendants is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n15 \n272.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n16 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law . . . [or] without \n17 \nobservance of procedure required by law” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). \n18 \n273.  Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the action contravenes or \n19 \notherwise fails to implement the statutory directives of Congress consistent with the statute’s \n20 \ntext, structure, and purpose. \n21 \n274.  Judicial review of an agency’s procedural compliance is “exacting.” See Kern \n22 \nCnty. Farm Bureau v. Allen, 450 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir. 2006). \n23 \n275.  The IIJA provides an exclusive list of circumstances in which the Defendants \n24 \nmay withhold or withdraw from a State its share of NEVI Formula Program funds for a fiscal \n25 \nyear. \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   53  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 55 of 68\n \n1  276.  The Defendants may withhold a State’s funds if it fails to timely submit a State \n2  Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan. After a State has submitted its Plan, the \n3  Defendants may withhold or withdraw a State’s funds for the fiscal year(s) covered by the Plan \n4  only after determining that the State has not taken actions to carry out that Plan, and only after \n5  following all statutorily required procedure. \n6  277.  Specifically, before determining that a State has not taken actions to carry out \n7  its Plan, the Defendants must comply with the strict procedural requirements set out in the \n8  IIJA, including to “notify the State, consult with the State, and identify actions that can be \n9  taken to rectify concerns, and provide at least 90 days for the State to rectify concerns and take \n10  action to carry out its plan.” 135 Stat. at 1422. \n11  278.  After making a determination that a State has not taken action to carry out its \n12  Plan, the Defendant must comply with additional procedural requirements before withholding \n13  or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds from the State. Specifically, the Defendants \n14  must give a further 60 days’ notice, an opportunity to be heard, and an opportunity to appeal \n15  before withholding or withdrawing any funds.” Id. \n16  279.  The Defendants’ action to prohibit obligations of NEVI Formula Program funds \n17  made available for obligation through the FHWA’s approval of each State’s State Electric \n18  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans constitutes a withdrawal or withholding of NEVI \n19  Formula Program funds. \n20  280.  The Defendants have therefore withdrawn and withheld NEVI Formula \n21  Program funds from Plaintiff States without making the statutorily required determination that \n22  Plaintiff States have not taken action to carry out their plans and without following any \n23  statutorily required procedure.  \n24  281.  The Defendants failed to provide notice, consult with Plaintiff States, or identify \n25  any concerns with Plaintiff States’ actions to carry out their State Electric Vehicle \n26  Infrastructure Deployment Plans. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   54  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 56 of 68\n \n1  282.  The Defendants failed to provide at least 90 days for Plaintiff States to rectify \n2  any concerns, failed to provide the statutorily required 60-day notice to Plaintiff States on their \n3  intent to withhold or withdraw funds, and failed to provide any opportunity to appeal the \n4  FHWA’s decision to withhold or withdraw funds. \n5  283.  Rather than follow the procedure to withhold or withdraw funds set forth by \n6  Congress in the IIJA, the Defendants achieved their goal of withholding NEVI Formula \n7  Program funds by prohibiting new obligations on the basis of their own unlawful “suspension” \n8  or revocation of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals, which \n9  was predicated solely on their recission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance.   \n10  284.  Each of Defendants’ actions represents the consummation of their decision-\n11  making and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n12  285.  Accordingly, Defendants’ action to withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula \n13  Program funds must therefore be set aside as not in accordance with law and without \n14  observance of procedure required by law.  \n15  286.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n16  affected by the federal Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and are entitled to \n17  declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n18  COUNT IV \nViolation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine, Usurping Congressional Authority \n19  Revocation of State Plan Approvals and Prohibition on Obligations \n20  287.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n21  preceding paragraphs. \n22  288.  Congress possesses exclusive power to legislate. Article I, Section 1 of the \n23  Constitution states that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of \n24  the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” U.S. Const. \n25  art. I, § 1; see Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (“There is no provision in \n26  the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”).  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   55  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 57 of 68\n \n1  289.  The Constitution also “grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \n2  President.” City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018); see \n3  U.S. Const. art. I, §9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending \n4  Clause). \n5  290.  The Constitution strictly controls how legislation enacted by Congress and \n6  signed into law by the President may be amended or repealed. Article I of the Constitution \n7  prescribes a “single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered[] procedure” for enacting \n8  such an amendment or repeal: passage of a new bill by both houses of Congress and \n9  presentment to the President for his signature or veto. Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. \n10  Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983); see U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2, 3. The Constitution \n11  identifies specific roles for the Executive in the lawmaking process, via the Recommendation \n12  Clause and the Presentment Clause, which creates the President’s veto power; outside these \n13  roles, the Executive Branch has no authority to change the law to suit the President’s policy. \n14  U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; id. § 7, cl. 2; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, \n15  587 (1952) (“In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws \n16  are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his \n17  functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the \n18  vetoing of laws he thinks bad.”); cf. Perry v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 582 U.S. 420, 441 (2017) \n19  (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (“If a statute needs repair, there’s a constitutionally prescribed way to \n20  do it. It’s called legislation. To be sure, the demands of bicameralism and presentment are real \n21  and the process can be protracted. But the difficulty of making new laws isn’t some bug in the \n22  constitutional design: it’s the point of the design, the better to preserve liberty.”). \n23  291.  Consistent with these principles, the Executive acts at the lowest ebb of his \n24  constitutional authority and power when he acts contrary to the will of Congress by attempting \n25  to unilaterally decline to spend appropriated funds. See Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637-638 \n26  (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   56  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 58 of 68\n \n1  292.  The Executive’s authority is particularly limited where, as here, Congress \n2  mandated that the Defendants disburse congressionally appropriated NEVI Formula Program \n3  funds to States in amounts in accordance with a specific formula, and the Defendants’ actions \n4  are incompatible with congressional directive. Congress established the NEVI Formula \n5  Program and appropriated funds for the express purpose of providing the States with funding \n6  for EV charging infrastructure and directed precise amounts to each State leaving no discretion \n7  for the Executive Branch with respect to those amounts.  \n8  293.  Congress has generally provided for a procedure by which the Executive may \n9  propose to Congress to either rescind or cancel funds. See Congressional Budget and \n10  Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. §§ 682 et seq. Congress also specifically \n11  prescribed the exclusive grounds for which the Defendants could withhold or withdraw NEVI \n12  Formula Program funds from a State and the procedure with which the Defendants must \n13  comply before doing so. Congress also mandated that funds lawfully withheld or withdrawn \n14  from a State be redistributed to other States and local jurisdictions for EV infrastructure \n15  development. \n16  294.  The Impoundment Control Act precludes the Executive from refusing to spend \n17  or distribute congressionally appropriated funds, instead requiring the President to “propose[]” \n18  any rescission to Congress (which Congress must then affirmatively approve). 2 U.S.C. \n19  §§ 683, 684(a). The Impoundment Control Act also does not authorize the Executive to defer \n20  funding for the reasons the Defendants invoke here. As described above, the Administration \n21  generally opposes the IIJA, and the NEVI Formula Program specifically, on policy grounds. \n22  Accordingly, the Executive’s authority is at its “lowest ebb.” See Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637-\n23  638 (Jackson, J., concurring). \n24  295.  The Defendants’ actions to “suspend” or revoke all State Electric Vehicle \n25  Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI \n26  Formula Program funds violate the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   57  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 59 of 68\n \n1  impermissibly arrogates to the Executive legislative and spending powers reserved to \n2  Congress. \n3  296.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \n4  respect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., \n5  Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015). Plaintiff States are “entitled to invoke the equitable jurisdiction \n6  to restrain enforcement” of unconstitutional acts by federal officials. Panama Ref. Co. v. Ryan, \n7  293 U.S. 388, 414 (1935). Federal courts may also set aside agency action found to be \n8  “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n9  297.  Plaintiff States are all aggrieved persons suffering a legal wrong or adversely \n10  affected by the Defendants’ conduct under 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n11  298.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff States are \n12  entitled to a declaration that the Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all \n13  State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan approvals and to categorically withhold \n14  or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds violate the constitutional separation of powers \n15  doctrine and impermissibly arrogate to the Executive power reserved to Congress. \n16  COUNT V \nViolation of Take Care Clause  \n17 \nRevocation of State Plan Approvals and Withholding of Funds \n18  299.  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \n19  preceding paragraphs. \n20  300.  The Take Care Clause provides that the Executive must “take Care that the \n21  Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; Utility Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. \n22  302, 327 (2014) (“Under our system of government, Congress makes laws and the President \n23  . . . ‘faithfully execute[s]’ them.”). \n24  301.  The Executive Branch violates the Take Care Clause where it declines to \n25  execute or otherwise undermines statutes enacted by Congress and signed into law. See In re \n26  United Mine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 F.3d 545, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[T]he President \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT –   58  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \nNO. 2:25-cv-00848-TL \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00848-TL     Document 124     Filed 08/01/25     Page 60 of 68\n \n1  is without authority to set aside congressional legislation by executive order.”); Kendall v. \n2  United States, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838) (rejecting argument that by charging the President with \n3  faithful execution of the laws, the Take Care clause “implies a power to forbid their \n4  execution”). \n5  302.  The Defendants’ actions to carry out President Trump’s directive to \n6  “[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal,” and specifically his directive to withhold funds  \n7  appropriated through the IIJA for EV charging infrastructure violates the Take Care Clause of \n8  the Constitution. \n9  303.  The Defendants’ actions to categorically “suspend” or revoke all State Electric \n10  Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans approvals and to categorically withhold or withdraw \n11  NEVI Formula Program funds are contrary to the Executive’s duty to faithfully execute the \n12  IIJA as enacted by Congress and therefore violate the Take Care Clause.  \n13  304.

Plaintiff States have a non-statutory right of action to have action taken in \n6 \nexcess of legal authority declared unlawful. \n7 \n309.  Agency or executive officer action taken in excess of legal authority is ultra \n8 \nvires. \n9 \n310.  A court reviewing executive action has an independent duty to determine what \n10 \nthe law is and whether executive officers invoking statutory authority exceed their statutory \n11 \npower. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. at 327.  \n12 \n311.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n13 \nDefendants to suspend or revoke State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan \n14 \napprovals, either individually or categorically. \n15 \n312.  Neither the IIJA nor any other federal statute or regulation authorizes the \n16 \nDefendants to categorically withhold or withdraw NEVI Formula Program funds. \n17 \n313.  The Defendants have therefore acted contrary to law and ultra vires by \n18 \ncategorically “suspending” or revoking all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment \n19 \nPlan approvals and categorically withholding or withdrawing NEVI Formula Program funds. \n20 \n314.
