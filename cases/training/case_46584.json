    "summary": "<p>This case raises a challenge to cuts in government funding for university research.</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, 2025, 13 public and private universities and three associations of universities sued the National Science Foundation (NSF) and its acting director in the District of Massachusetts, challenging cuts to \"indirect cost rates\" for NSF-funded research grant formulas. While direct costs are those directly attributable to a specific project, indirect costs are costs necessary for research but are not directly attributable to a specific project. On May 2, 2025, NSF issued a policy stating that \"NSF will apply a standard indirect cost rate not to exceed 15% to all grants and cooperative agreements awarded to [universities] for which indirect costs are allowable.\" Previously, the agency \"exercised its authority to promulgate regulations requiring agencies to negotiate indirect cost rates with individual funding recipients through a carefully regulated process based on each institution&rsquo;s unique needs and cost structure.\" \"The purpose of this process is to ensure that the negotiated rate correctly captures the actual indirect costs incurred in the conduct of research.\" However, the new policy would remove the negotiation aspect of the process, instead imposing a blanket cap on indirect cost grants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs raised several claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. First, the plaintiffs argued that the Rate Cap Policy was contrary to law, since Congress did not expressly authorize the agency to enact such a sweeping change, and the \"Supreme Court has underscored that agencies may not enact sweeping rules of this sort without express congressional authorization.\" Second, the plaintiffs argued the policy was contrary to law because the applicable regulations \"do not authorize NSF to make a unilateral decision to impose an arbitrary cap on the rate applicable to all universities that does not attempt to approximate actual indirect costs.\" Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that the policy was arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiffs asked the court to vacate the policy, to declare it unlawful, and to enjoin the defendants from taking steps to implement the policy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Indira Talwani. On May 8, the plaintiffs filed a combined motion for preliminary injunction and for summary judgment. The defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on May 27. Judge Talwani granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on June 20, denying their motion for a preliminary injunction as moot. 2025 WL 1725857. The court first found, contrary to the defendants' arguments, that the plaintiffs had shown standing based on an \"imminent and substantial\" future injury. \"Qualifying for less federal funding is a future injur[y] that is sufficient to confer standing where the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.\" The court found it sufficiently likely that one of the plaintiffs would qualify for less funding under the Rate Cap Policy. Second, the court held that the Rate Cap Policy was reviewable under the APA, since \"statutory standards cabin the agency&rsquo;s exercise of the discretion Congress has given it,\" and regulations \"dictate when and how NSF may deviate from negotiated indirect cost rates.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Turning to the merits, the court found that the statutory text and executive interpretations of relevant statutory sections supported plaintiffs' claim that the NSF cannot implement a 15% Indirect Cost Rate. The court also ruled that with the Rate Cap Policy, \"NSF has rejected the regulatory framework for funding indirect research costs and has limited the recovery of actual costs by imposing a de minimis rate&nbsp;<br />on IHEs with [previously] negotiated indirect cost rates.\" Finally, the court held the policy to be arbitrary and capricious, since the Policy Notice in which NSF laid out the Rate Cap Policy expressed goals that the agency hoped to reach but failed to explain how the policy would assist the agency in reaching those goals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Based on its findings, the court vacated the Rate Cap Policy and issued a declaratory judgment finding the policy unlawful, but the court refused to issue a permanent injunction, since it decided that vacatur of the policy and the declaratory judgment provided the plaintiffs with adequate relief.&nbsp; The court entered final judgment that same day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2025, the defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeal for the First Circuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 26, 2025, before any briefing had occurred, the defendants filed a voluntary motion to dismiss the appeal. The motion did not explain the reasons for seeking dismissal. The motion was granted on September 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case was about university groups challenging big cuts to government funding for research. On May 5, 2025, thirteen universities and three college associations sued the National Science Foundation (NSF) after the agency created a new rule on May 2, 2025. The new policy set a blanket cap on “indirect costs” for research grants, meaning NSF would only cover up to 15% of these costs for every university. Indirect costs are important expenses that support research, like covering labs, electricity, or administrative jobs, but they can’t always be traced to one project. Before this new rule, each university negotiated their own rate based on their actual needs.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs claimed this new policy broke the law. They said Congress never gave NSF clear permission to make such a big change, and that the law requires negotiated, not arbitrary, rates. They also said the rule was “arbitrary and capricious” because the NSF didn’t give a good reason for the cap or explain how it made sense.\r\n\r\nThe case was assigned to Judge Indira Talwani, who agreed with the universities. On June 20, 2025, she ruled that the plaintiffs would likely lose funding under the new cap, which could hurt them. The court found the policy unlawful and vacated it.\r\n\r\nThe government filed an appeal but then, on September 30, 2025, dropped the appeal. The policy remains void, and the universities won the case.",

This suit challenges the unilateral decision of the National Science Foundation \n(“NSF”) to slash “indirect cost rates” for government-funded research.  This policy is identical in \nkey respects to policies of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and Department of Energy \n(“DOE”) that district courts have already enjoined.  Massachusetts v. Nat’l Insts. of Health \n(“NIH”), No. 25-CV-10338, __ F. Supp. 3d __, 2025 WL 702163, at *1 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025), \njudgment entered, 2025 WL 1063760 (D. Mass. Apr. 4, 2025), appeal docketed, No. 25-1344 (1st \nCir. Apr. 9, 2025); Ass’n of Am. Univs. (“AAU”) v. Dep’t of Energy, No. 25-cv-10912, 2025 WL \n1119791, at *1 (D. Mass Apr. 16, 2025).  NSF’s action is unlawful for most of the same reasons, \nand it is especially arbitrary because NSF has not even attempted to address many of the flaws the \ndistrict courts found with NIH’s and DOE’s unlawful policies.  As with those policies, if NSF’s \npolicy is allowed to stand, it will badly undermine scientific research at America’s universities and \nerode our Nation’s enviable status as a global leader in scientific research and innovation.   \n2.  For decades, universities have built their research institutions on the government’s \nsettled approach to funding the actual costs of the research it sponsors.  Some of those costs are \n“direct;” that is, they are readily attributable to specific projects.  Others are “indirect;” that is, they \nare necessary for the research to occur but harder to attribute to individual projects.  Computer \nsystems to analyze enormous volumes of data; information-technology and utility systems \nproviding the backbone for those efforts; building, maintaining, operating, and keeping up to date \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 3 of 40\n \nthe buildings in which funded research occurs, including their specialized electrical, plumbing, \nand waste-management systems; and researchers and administrative staff who keep the systems \nrunning—all are critical to cutting-edge research, but their costs typically cannot be allocated to \nany single project.  Because of caps on administrative costs, moreover, universities contribute \nmuch of their own funds to cover such costs, thereby subsidizing the work funded by grants and \ncooperative agreements.  In the 2023 fiscal year, universities bore $6.8 billion in unrecovered \nindirect costs.1 \n3.  Congress authorized agencies to “provide for payment of reimbursable indirect \ncosts on the basis of predetermined fixed-percentage rates” via a bespoke process accounting for \neach institution’s unique cost structures and grants, 41 U.S.C. § 4708, and it delegated to the \nExecutive Branch the task of identifying institution-specific metrics.  The Office of Management \nand Budget (“OMB”) exercised its authority to promulgate regulations requiring agencies to \nnegotiate indirect cost rates with individual funding recipients through a carefully regulated \nprocess based on each institution’s unique needs and cost structure.  See 31 U.S.C. § 503(a), \n(b)(2)(C) (empowering OMB to “establish governmentwide financial management policies for \nexecutive agencies,” including as to “grant[s]”).  By regulation, this negotiation yields a rate that \nis  intended to  reflect the actual, verified indirect costs incurred by the institution.   Then, \n“[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal agencies,” unless one of the narrow \nexceptions applies.  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1).   \n4.  The purpose of this process is to ensure that the negotiated rate correctly captures \nthe actual indirect costs incurred in the conduct of research.  Differences in indirect cost rates  \n \n1 Nat’l Ctr. for Sci. & Eng’g Statistics, Higher Education R&D Expenditures Increased 11.2%, \nExceeded $108 Billion in FY 2023 (Nov. 25, 2024), https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25313. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 4 of 40\n \nreflect the reality that institutions engage in different types of research and have unique mixes of \nfixed and variable costs that are allocated across multiple research projects.  Government funding \nagencies may deviate from the negotiated rates only in limited circumstances, and only via \nprocedures that provide ample notice and protections to ensure that the basic terms of engagement \nare not changed precipitously.  The regulatory framework recognizes that there is no one-size-fits-\nall approach and that participating institutions have profound reliance interests in the negotiated \nrates—rates that are tailored to their circumstances and that facilitate the work that makes the \nUnited States a world leader in cutting-edge research.  \n5.  This is not the first time an administration has considered limiting indirect cost rates \nand superimposing a one-size-fits-all regime on what has long been a tailored, negotiated process.  \nIn 2017, the Administration proposed in the appropriations process slashing the indirect cost rate \nto 10% for all NIH grants.  The reaction in Congress was swift and bipartisan, and Congress \nidentified serious problems immediately.  It observed that the proposal would “radically change \nthe nature of the Federal Government’s relationship with the research community” by altering a \nmethodology for indirect rates that “has been in place since 1965”; emphasized that Congress had \n“not seen any details of the proposal that might explain how it could be accomplished without \nthrowing research programs across the country into disarray,” S. Rep. No. 115-150, at 109 (2017); \nand concluded that this proposal was “misguided and would have a devastating impact on \nbiomedical research across the country,” H.R. Rep. No. 115-244, at 50 (2017).   \n6.  In February 2025, the Administration nonetheless tried to impose a similar limit \nthrough executive action:  NIH issued a notice stating that it was “imposing a standard indirect \ncost rate on all grants of 15%.”  NIH, Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grants Policy \nStatement: Indirect Cost Rates, NOT-OD-25-068 (Feb. 7, 2025), https://grants.nih.gov/grants/\n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 5 of 40\n \nguide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html.  A federal district court quickly enjoined that policy, \nfinding that the Administration had not only violated an appropriations rider that Congress had \nenacted in the wake of the 2017 NIH  episode, but also had violated the government-wide \nregulations governing indirect cost rates and the reasoned decisionmaking requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  NIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *1. \n7.  Even so, the Administration on the heels of that decision nonetheless issued an \nalmost identical policy at DOE.  The policy states that “hereinafter, the Department [of Energy] \nwill no longer use the negotiated indirect cost rate” for universities; “set[] a standardized 15 percent \nindirect cost rate for all grant awards to” universities; and announced that DOE “is undertaking \naction to terminate all grant awards to [universities] that do not conform with this updated policy.” \nDOE, Policy Flash: Adjusting Department of Energy Grant Policy for Institutions of Higher \nEducation (IHE) (Apr. 11, 2025), https://www.energy.gov/management/pf-2025-22-adjusting-\ndepartment-energy-grant-policy-institutions-higher-education-ihe.  Again, a federal district court \nquickly enjoined the policy. AAU, 2025 WL 1119791, at *1. \n8.  Now the Administration has brought the same approach to NSF.  On Friday, May \n2, 2025, NSF issued a new policy imposing a categorical cap on all new grant and cooperative \nagreement awards to universities.  That policy states that “[e]ffective May 5, 2025, NSF will apply \na standard indirect cost rate not to exceed 15% to all grants and cooperative agreements awarded \nto [universities] for which indirect costs are allowable.”  NSF, Policy Notice: Implementation of \nStandard 15% Indirect Cost Rate (May 2, 2025) (attached as Ex. A) (“Rate Cap Policy” or \n“Policy”).  The announcement acknowledges that “[i]ndirect costs support the infrastructure and \nadministrative functions necessary for the conduct of federally supported research,” but then \nimposes without explanation a categorical limit on indirect cost rates of 15%.  Id.  The Rate Cap \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 6 of 40\n \nPolicy applies this supposedly necessary limit on indirect cost rates only to universities, not to \nother institutions that participate in NSF grants and cooperative agreements.2 \n9.  As with the similar policies at NIH and DOE, NSF’s Rate Cap Policy is clearly \nunlawful.   First, it  violates the governing statutes in myriad respects.   The Policy sets “a \npredetermined fixed-percentage rate[]” of 15% that  is  not based on an  estimate of actual \n“reimbursable indirect costs.”  41 U.S.C. § 4708.  And with Congress having preserved a tailored \napproach to indirect cost rates since 1965, it beggars belief to suggest that Congress—without \nsaying a word—impliedly authorized NSF to enact a sweeping, one-size-fits-all command that will \nupend research at America’s universities.  See MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 \nU.S. 218, 229 (1994).   \n10.  Second, the Rate Cap Policy violates the indirect cost regulations that OMB \npromulgated to provide stability, protect reliance interests, and ensure that recipients can cover the \nactual costs of conducting the research the government has selected them to undertake.  Those \nregulations provide, in no uncertain terms, that the “[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must be \naccepted by all Federal agencies.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1).  NSF’s reading of that mandate’s \nnarrow exceptions would nullify that command, effectively replace the word “must” with “may,” \nand allow any agency to reject those negotiated rates simply by announcing a different across-the-\nboard policy.  Moreover, Plaintiffs collectively have thousands of proposals pending before the \nNSF that were prepared in reliance on their individually negotiated indirect cost rates.  To the \nextent the new rate will be applied to awards that did not include notice of the 15% rate, the Rate \nCap Policy separately violates the regulations’ requirement that any departure from the negotiated \nrate appear upfront in the notice of funding opportunity.  \n \n2 This Complaint uses “universities” as a shorthand for the “institutions of higher education” that \nare subject to the Rate Cap Policy.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 7 of 40\n \n11.  Third, the Rate Cap Policy’s conclusory explanation falls far short of satisfying the \nAPA’s  reasoned-decisionmaking  requirements.    The  Policy  ignores  that  the  process  of \napproximating indirect costs is inherently individualized and is—at its core—incompatible with \nits one-size-fits-all approach.  The Policy ignores the immense harms from jettisoning an approach \ndating from 1965—harms that Congress itself emphasized in rejecting a materially identical \nproposal in 2017.  The Policy ignores the reliance interests of the universities that carry out \nfederally sponsored research, which have structured their budgets and investment decisions on the \ndurable approach to indirect cost rates that Congress has embedded in statute and that the \nExecutive Branch has protected in regulation.  And the Policy ignores the NSF’s policy on cost \nsharing and the findings underlying that policy, which recognize that NSF should generally fund \nthe full costs of the research it sponsors and that attempts to impose mandatory cost sharing create \nimmense problems.  Meanwhile, the Policy inexplicably singles out universities and does not \nexplain why it exempts other recipients. \n12.  The effects will be immediate and irreparable.  If indirect cost rates are cut to 15%, \nthe amount and scope of future research by universities will decline precipitously.   Vital scientific \nwork will come to a halt, training will be stifled, and the pace of scientific discoveries will slow.  \nProgress on national security objectives, such as maintaining strategic advantages in areas like \nAI and quantum computing, will falter.  And because of all this, America’s standing as a world \nleader in scientific discovery will decline.  The proposals that are pending before the NSF, which \nresponded to notices of funding opportunity, all assumed in their scopes of work and budgets that \ntheir home institutions’ indirect cost rates would be used.  These include not only fundamental \nresearch into scientific understanding, but also projects pioneering cutting-edge innovations in \nartificial  intelligence,  quantum  computing, cybersecurity, semiconductors, virtual  reality, \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 8 of 40\n \ncryopreservation of living tissue, and other technology fields.  Many of these proposals will no \nlonger be viable.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13.  This action arises under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 701-706, and regulations governing federal grants and cooperative agreements.  This Court \nhas subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the APA.  \n14.

Plaintiff Arizona Board of Regents is the governing body of Arizona State \nUniversity (“ASU”), a public university with four campuses in Maricopa County, Arizona.  ASU \nis a comprehensive research university committed to advancing research and discovery of public \nvalue and has one of the fastest-growing research enterprises in the United States.  In fiscal year \n2024, ASU received 172 awards from NSF, totaling over $110.5 million in anticipated funding \nand $87 million in obligated funding. The on-campus facilities and administrative rate applicable \nto NSF awards for ASU’s 2026 fiscal year, as negotiated with the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, is 57.0%.   ASU intends to apply for new funding awards, and/or renewals and \n \nMay 5, 2025).  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 10 of 40\n \ncontinuations of existing funding awards, in the next year and in future years to come. \n19.  Plaintiff  Brown  University  (“Brown”)  is  a  private  university  located  in \nProvidence, Rhode Island.  Brown conducts fundamental and applied research directed at the \nforefront of national priorities. In the 2024 fiscal year, Brown expended $34.4 million in grants \nfrom NSF to support nearly 250 projects in every scientific discipline represented by NSF.  \nThrough the 2027 fiscal year, Brown’s predetermined indirect cost rate is 59.5% for on-campus \nresearch.  If—contrary to what Brown has negotiated with the federal government—the indirect \ncost rate was reduced to 15% for new awards, that would significantly reduce Brown’s anticipated \nannual indirect cost recovery.  For example, applying the 15% rate to the anticipated modified \ndirect costs over the next five years, Brown’s anticipated annual indirect cost recovery would be \nreduced by $11.25M from $9M each year to $6.75M a year.  Brown intends to apply for new \nfunding awards, and/or renewals and continuations of existing funding awards, in the next year \nand in future years to come. \n20.  Plaintiff California Institute of Technology (“Caltech”) is a private university \nlocated in Pasadena, California.  Caltech leads research in areas such as neuroscience, biology \nand health, quantum science and engineering, advanced computing and artificial intelligence, and \nplanetary and earth science.  Caltech has 210 active NSF awards and subawards.  In the 2024 \nfiscal year, Caltech expended $93,411,998 in conducting research supported by NSF; of this total, \n$71,709,654 were expended as direct costs, $21,702,344 as indirect costs.  NSF’s planned cap of \n15% for indirect cost expenditures would result in an annual loss of approximately $14.8 million \nto Caltech’s planned research budget.  Caltech intends to apply for new funding awards, and/or \nrenewals and continuations of existing funding awards, in the next year and in future years to \ncome. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 11 of 40\n \n21.  Plaintiff The  Regents  of  the  University of  California (“UC”) is  a  public \ncorporation that owns and operates the University of California system as a public trust, and is \nlocated in Oakland, California.  In the 2024 fiscal year, UC spent $435.7 million in direct costs \non NSF contracts and grants, for which it received $138.6 million in indirect cost recovery.  If—\ncontrary to what UC has negotiated with the federal government—the F&A cost rate for NSF \ngrants was reduced to 15%, UC calculates, based on 2023-2024 modified total direct costs, that \nwould  reduce the  University’s anticipated annual F&A  cost  recovery by  approximately \n$94.4 million.  UC intends to apply for new funding awards, and/or renewals and continuations \nof existing funding awards, in the next year and in future years to come. \n22.  Plaintiff Carnegie Mellon University (“CMU”) is a private university located in \nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  A leading research institution and global leader in computer science, \nengineering,  robotics,  the  arts,  and  design,  CMU  fosters  and  supports  groundbreaking \ninterdisciplinary research that impacts society in transformative ways.  CMU has 690 active \nresearch awards from NSF totaling $332.6 million in total funding, made up of $296.3 million in \ngrants and $36.3 million in cooperative agreements.  CMU’s indirect cost rate for on-campus \nresearch for the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2025, is 51.8%.  If—contrary to what CMU has \nnegotiated with the federal government—the indirect cost rate was reduced to 15% for new \nawards, that would in time reduce CMU’s anticipated total annual indirect cost recovery by \napproximately $12.8 million to approximately $5.3 million.  CMU intends to apply for new \nfunding awards, and/or renewals and continuations of existing funding awards, in the next year \nand in future years to come. \n23.  Plaintiff University of Chicago (“UChicago”) is a private university located in \nChicago, Illinois. UChicago is a leading academic and research institution driving field-defining \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 12 of 40\n \nresearch that produces new knowledge and breakthroughs with substantial impact: NSF funding \nsupports UChicago faculty, researchers, and students to make critical advancements promoting \nAmerican innovation, economic growth, and national competitiveness in areas including AI and \nmachine learning, particle physics, quantum sensors in industrial applications and healthcare, \nquantum  computing,  chemical  biology  and  mechanistic  organic  chemistry,  astronomy, \neconomics, mathematical and statistical  underpinnings of data  science, nanomaterials and \nmaterials science, and the physics of living systems.  NSF’s planned cap of 15% for indirect cost \nexpenditures would result in an approximately $14.5 million dollar loss annually to UChicago’s \nplanned research budget.  UChicago intends to apply for new funding awards, and/or renewals \nand continuations of existing funding awards, in the next year and in future years to come. \n24.  Plaintiff Cornell University (“Cornell”) is a private university located in Ithaca, \nNew York.  Cornell is a leading research institution that has been selected by the federal \ngovernment to conduct a wide variety of vital forms of research on behalf of United States \ncitizens, funded in part by agency awards, cooperative agreements, and contracts from across the \nfederal government, including NSF.  For the 2024 fiscal year, Cornell expended approximately \n$138 million on more than 580 grants and cooperative agreements from NSF.  Cornell has \nnegotiated an indirect cost rate of up to 64% for its Ithaca campus.  Reducing the indirect cost \nrecovery rate to  15%—instead of using  the rate  Cornell has negotiated with  the federal \ngovernment—would be devastating for achieving results in the type of research that  NSF \nsponsors.  If Cornell’s NSF-sponsored portfolio remained stable, in a typical fiscal year the cap \nwould reduce Cornell’s indirect cost recovery on NSF-sponsored activities to approximately $8 \nmillion per year, a decrease of approximately $25 million each and every year.  Cornell intends \nto apply for new funding awards, and/or renewals and continuations of existing funding awards, \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 13 of 40\n \nin the next year and in future years to come. \n25.  Plaintiff Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (“Illinois”) is the governing \nbody of the University of Illinois, a public university with its flagship campus in Urbana-\nChampaign, Illinois.  Illinois receives substantial annual funding from NSF.  In the 2024 fiscal \nyear,  Illinois  had  501  unique  principal  investigators  receiving  NSF  funding,  totaling \n$129,288,449 in NSF funding ($97,452,569 in direct costs and $31,838,880 in indirect costs, \nbased on a 58.6% indirect cost rate).  NSF is the University’s leading funder, and Illinois has \nreceived more NSF funding than any other university in the nation for six consecutive years.  \nBased on expenditures from the 2024 fiscal year, a 15% indirect cost rate would have resulted in \nan estimated loss of more than $23 million.  Illinois intends to apply for new funding awards, \nand/or renewals and continuations of existing funding awards, in the next year and in future years \nto come. \n26.  Plaintiff Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) is a private land-grant \nuniversity located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Founded to accelerate the nation’s industrial \nrevolution, MIT faculty, researchers, and graduates have invented fundamental technologies, \nlaunched new industries, and advanced human understanding of science, technology, and other \nareas of scholarship.  In the 2024 fiscal year, MIT received $97 million in funding from NSF for \nperforming sponsored research under grants and cooperative agreements.  MIT conducts research \nunder 469 grants and 19 cooperative agreements from NSF that are currently active for the 2025 \nfiscal year.  These awards involve 322 unique principal investigators.  The on-campus facilities \nand administrative rate applicable to NSF awards for MIT’s 2025 fiscal year, as negotiated with \nthe Office of Naval Research, is 59.0%. When fully implemented, MIT estimates that NSF’s \nproposed cap of 15% for indirect cost recovery would result in a projected $18 million loss \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 14 of 40\n \nannually to MIT’s planned research budget, assuming fiscal year 2024 levels of NSF-funded \ncampus modified total direct cost.  MIT intends to apply for new funding awards in the next year \nand in future years to come. \n27.  Plaintiff Regents of the University of Michigan (“Michigan”) is the governing \nbody of the University of Michigan, a public university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  In the \n2024 fiscal year, Michigan received $169 million in NSF funding—approximately $119 million \nallocated for direct costs and $50 million for indirect costs.  Through the 2025 fiscal year, \nMichigan’s predetermined indirect cost rate is  56%.   If—contrary to  what Michigan  has \nnegotiated with the federal government—the indirect cost rate is reduced to 15%, that reduction, \nif applied to Michigan’s entire NSF portfolio over the next five years, would reduce Michigan’s \nanticipated annual indirect cost recovery by $36 million. Michigan intends to apply for new \nfunding awards, and/or renewals and continuations of existing funding awards, in the next year \nand in future years to come. \n28.  Plaintiff Regents of the University of Minnesota (“Minnesota”) is the governing \nbody of the University of Minnesota, an institution of higher learning established by the \nTerritorial Laws of the State of Minnesota and perpetuated by the Minnesota Constitution as a \nconstitutional corporation.   Minnesota holds 543 active direct NSF  grant and cooperative \nagreement awards valued at more than $387 million in total costs, including $291 million in direct \ncosts and $96 million in indirect costs; Minnesota serves as a partner to other NSF recipients via \n81 subawards with an additional $25 million in funding.  Minnesota’s predetermined indirect cost \nrate through fiscal year 2028 is 54% for on-campus organized research.  If—contrary to what \nMinnesota has negotiated with the federal government—the indirect cost rate was reduced to \n15%, that would significantly reduce Minnesota’s anticipated annual indirect cost recovery.  For \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 15 of 40\n \nexample, applying the 15% rate to the anticipated modified direct costs over the next five years \nwould result in an increasingly greater reduction each year, ultimately estimated to be at least \n$21.1 million to $8.3 million in year five.  Minnesota intends to apply for new funding awards, \nand/or renewals and continuations of existing funding awards, in the next year and in future years \nto come. \n29.  Plaintiff University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”) is a private university located in \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania.  In the 2024 fiscal year, Penn’s research expenditures were more than \n$73.3 million on NSF funded projects. There were 132 projects on grants supported by the NSF, \nwith an awarded value of $47,467,560, and an additional 4 cooperative agreements with an \nawarded total value of $28,374,494.  Through the 2027 fiscal year, the predetermined indirect \ncost rate for Penn is 62.5% for on-campus research.  NSF’s planned cap of 15% for indirect cost \nexpenditures would result in an over $10 million-dollar loss annually to Penn’s planned research \nbudget.  Penn intends to apply for new funding awards, and/or renewals and continuations of \nexisting funding awards, in the next year and in future years to come. \n30.  Plaintiff The Trustees of Princeton University (“Princeton”) is the formal legal \nname of Princeton University, a private university located in Princeton, New Jersey.  Princeton \nis a world-class research institution that aims to unite people, resources, and opportunities for the \ncreation, preservation, and transmission of knowledge for the benefit of the nation and humanity.  \nIn the 2024 fiscal year, Princeton expended approximately $79 million in conducting research \nsupported by NSF.  Of this total, approximately $20.5 million were expended as indirect costs to \nsupport needs such as the infrastructure, research administration, compliance, and security \nexpenses required to conduct the funded research.  Princeton’s negotiated on-campus indirect \ncost rate for fiscal year 2025 is 64%.  Princeton intends to apply for new funding awards, and/or \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 16 of 40\n \nrenewals and continuations of existing funding awards, in the next year and in future years to \ncome.  Princeton would therefore lose substantial dollars if Princeton’s predetermined indirect \ncost rates were reduced to 15%. \n31.  Defendant National Science Foundation (“NSF”) is an independent agency of the \nfederal government that supports fundamental research and education in all the non-medical \nfields of science and engineering. \n32.  Defendant Brian Stone is the Acting Director of NSF.  He is sued in his official \ncapacity. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA. NSF’s Grants And Cooperative Agreements. \n33.  For decades, NSF-funded research at universities has made the United States a \nworld leader in  science.   The federal government awards billions of dollars to  research \nuniversities that can most effectively further NSF’s goals.  In fiscal year 2023, NSF awarded \nnearly $6.7 billion to over 621 universities.   \n34.  NSF awards have funded scientific research that has led to innumerable scientific \nbreakthroughs, including the creation of 3D printing and major developments in artificial \nintelligence (“AI”).  Two hundred sixty-eight NSF-supported scientists have earned Nobel Prizes \nfor their groundbreaking scientific work.4 \n35.  Most NSF-funded research occurs at outside institutions, including universities, \nnonprofit institutions, tribal nations, for-profit organizations, and state and local governments.  \nThis approach allows NSF to fund a wide array of institutions, promote competition for research \n \n4 U.S. Nat’l Sci. Found., NSF Continues Strong Legacy with Nobel Prize Winners, U.S. Nat’l \nSci. Found., https://www.nsf.gov/science-matters/nsf-continues-strong-legacy-nobel-prize-\nwinners. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 17 of 40\n \ngrants  and  cooperative agreements, and facilitate the  training  of the  next  generation of \nresearchers. \n36.  In fiscal year 2023, NSF’s total research and development (“R&D”) expenses \nwere roughly $7,490,000,000.  Of that, roughly $6,048,000,000 went to institutions of higher \neducation, while the rest went to other recipients.  This means that over 80% of NSF’s total R&D \nobligations went to institutions of higher education.5 \n37.  NSF pursues its research goals by funding the critical scientific research of the \norganizational Plaintiffs’ member universities and the university Plaintiffs.  At any given time, \nindividual research universities often depend on myriad NSF awards that support independent \nresearch projects across multiple university departments and centers.  \nB.  The Indirect Cost System Structure \n38.  These NSF  awards are issued pursuant to  a well-established legislative and \nregulatory framework.  Congress has authorized NSF to provide for grants and other forms of \nassistance under various statutes, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1862(a), and it has authorized agencies to use \n“predetermined fixed-percentage rates” for “payment of reimbursable indirect costs,” see 41 \nU.S.C. § 4708.  Congress also instructed OMB to issue general guidance on fiscal administration \nissues.  See 31 U.S.C. § 503(a), (b)(2)(C) (empowering OMB to “establish governmentwide \nfinancial management policies for executive agencies,” including as to “grant[s]”).  In turn, OMB \nhas established uniform guidance for agencies to administer grants and cooperative agreements \nunder the agencies’ purview.  See 2 C.F.R. pt. 200 (setting forth “Uniform Administrative \n \n5 Nat’l Ctr. for Sci. & Eng’g Statistics, Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development \n(2023-2024), https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/federal-funds-research-development/2023-\n2024#tableCtr13393 (Table 7: “Federal obligations for research and experimental development, \nby agency and performer”); see also id. (Table 21: “Federal obligations for research, by agency \nand performer”).  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 18 of 40\n \nRequirements, Cost  Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards”).   NSF  has \nexpressly adopted OMB’s guidance into its own regulations.  See 2 C.F.R. § 2500.100 (adopting \nOMB guidance in 2 C.F.R. pt. 200). \n39.  As provided by regulation, NSF’s competitive grantmaking process begins with a \nnotice of funding opportunities for a specific topic followed by new application submissions.  See \n2 C.F.R. § 200.204. \n40.  After a formal review process that includes peer review, NSF issues a legally \nbinding Notice of Award (“NOA”) to selected grant recipients stating that funds may be requested \n(i.e., drawn down) from the agency.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.211(b)(7) (establishing that the award \nmust include the “[a]mount of [f]ederal [f]unds [o]bligated by this [a]ction”).  An NOA is issued \nfor the initial budget period and each subsequent budget period.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.211(c)(1)(iv). \n41.  Federal grant recipients generally do not receive lump-sum grants.  Instead, they \nuse cost-based accounting systems under which they first incur expenses and then recover their \nactual, documented costs for conducting research. \n42.  The costs of conducting NSF-funded research come in two types.  The first is \n“direct costs”—costs that can be attributed to a specific research project.  For example, the salary \nof a graduate student assigned to a particular research project, or the cost of a specialized piece \nof equipment purchased for a research project is a direct cost. \n43.  The second is “indirect costs”—costs that are necessary for research but that \nsupport multiple research projects.   \n44.  “[I]ndirect costs” are comprised of “[f]acilities” and “[a]dministration” costs.  2 \nC.F.R. § 200.414(a).   The “[f]acilities” category is “defined as depreciation on buildings, \nequipment and  capital  improvements, interest  on  debt  associated with  certain  buildings, \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 19 of 40\n \nequipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses.”  Id. This \ncategory includes the costs of construction of physical equipment and building infrastructure and \nmaintenance of that infrastructure necessary for carrying out federally funded research, including \nhighly specialized facilities and laboratories.  Those costs are indirect because a single building, \nsuch as a state-of-the-art nuclear facility, might house numerous research groups engaged in \nmultiple distinct projects.  Facilities costs typically account for the largest share of indirect costs. \n45.  The “[a]dministration” category is defined as “general administration and general \nexpenses such as the director’s office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures \nnot listed specifically under one of the subcategories of ‘Facilities.”’  Id.  This category includes \ncosts related to the administrative and compliance activities required to conduct federally \nsponsored research, such as compliance activities like Institutional Review Boards required for \nresearch involving human subjects, information technology professionals, experts on safety and \nsecurity, technical staff, and many others.  These costs are indirect because a single employee or \ngroup of employees will handle these necessary administrative activities across multiple NSF \nawards.  Because of caps on administrative costs, moreover, universities contribute a significant \namount of their own funds to cover such costs, thereby subsidizing the work funded by grants \nand cooperative agreements.  \n46.  Federal regulations require research institutions to express their indirect costs as a \nrate that is multiplied by the overhead-bearing direct costs of each individual research grant \nassociated with those costs.  See Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F & A) Costs Identification \nand Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs).  This \nmethodology ensures that indirect costs are allocated fairly across supported projects, with the \nmore expensive and resource-intensive research projects being allocated a larger share of indirect \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 20 of 40\n \ncosts.  As a simplified example, suppose a single laboratory houses two research projects—one \nwith $75,000 of annual overhead-bearing direct costs and one with $25,000 of annual overhead-\nbearing direct costs.  Suppose, too, that the laboratory’s sole indirect cost is the cost of electricity, \nwhich costs $10,000 per year.  Because the cost of electricity ($10,000) is 10% of the overhead-\nbearing direct costs ($100,000), the indirect cost rate would be 10%.  Thus, $7,500 of electricity \ncosts would be allocated to the first project, and $2,500 of electricity costs would be allocated to \nthe second project.   \n47.  Federal regulations prescribe a detailed methodology for negotiating indirect cost \nrates.  See Appendix III to Part 200.  Typically, a single agency negotiates an indirect cost rate \nwith an institution.  For universities, rates are generally negotiated by either “the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) or the Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research \n(DOD), normally depending on which of the two agencies (HHS or DOD) provide[d] more funds \ndirectly to the [relevant] educational institution for the most recent three years.” 2 C.F.R. pt. 200, \napp. III(C)(11)(a)(1). \n48.  That indirect cost rate then applies to all of that institution’s grants and cooperative \nagreements across the entire federal government.  Federal regulations require institutions to \nconduct and submit to their federal agency comprehensive cost analyses that follow detailed \nfederal cost accounting guidelines governing reasonable and allowable indirect costs.  For \nexample, if an institution seeks to recover the cost of building maintenance related to federal \nresearch support, it must document those costs and then allocate those maintenance costs across \nresearch and non-research programs. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 21 of 40\n \n49.  The federal agency then reviews and verifies these proposals and determines the \ninstitution’s indirect cost rate based on its judgment of which rate reflects actual, verified costs \nincurred by the institution.   \n50.  Typically, the negotiated rates remain in effect for two to four years.  \n51.  After the costs are incurred, federal agencies conduct audits to ensure that the \nnegotiated indirect cost rate conforms to the actual indirect costs that were incurred.  The indirect \ncost rate can be adjusted if the audit establishes that the institution has recovered excess costs. \n52.  Negotiated rates vary significantly from institution to institution.  The primary \nreason for this variation is that different institutions conduct different types of research.  Scientific \nlaboratories tend to be far more expensive to build and maintain than generic office buildings.  \nAs such, an institution engaging in cutting-edge physics research will likely have a higher indirect \ncost rate than an institution primarily engaged in social science research.  Even in the context of \nscientific research, some types of research are more expensive than others.  If a particular \ninstitution invests in an expensive piece of advanced lab equipment that supports multiple lines \nof research, that institution will have higher indirect cost rates than a different institution that \ndoes not use expensive lab equipment or uses such equipment for only one research project.   \n53.  Institutions with higher-than-average negotiated indirect cost rates are typically \nthose that support facility-intensive types of research.  State of the art nuclear, energy and \ncomputing research (including AI and quantum computing), for example, often requires higher \nindirect cost rates.  Past studies show that indirect cost rates for university research are slightly \nless than those for other research entities, i.e., that universities had the lowest percentage of total \nresearch costs classified as indirect costs as compared to federal and industrial laboratories.6  \n \n6 Ass’n of Am. Univs., Frequently Asked Questions About Facilities and Administrative (F&A) \nCosts of Federally Sponsored University Research (Feb. 10, 2025), https://www.aau.edu/key-\n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 22 of 40\n \n54.  The “[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal agencies” \nunless a deviation therefrom “for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award” is \n“required by Federal statute or regulation” or is “approved by the awarding Federal agency in \naccordance with [2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3)].”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1). \n55.  The cross-referenced provision, 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3), in turn makes clear that \nthe negotiated rates remain the baseline and that it authorizes only specific “deviations” for \nindividual awards or classes of awards when specified criteria are met.  In particular, that \nprovision specifies that “[t]he Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the \npolicies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek \nand justify deviations from negotiated rates.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3). \n56.  Pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(4), “[t]he Federal agency must include, in the \nnotice of funding opportunity, the policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement or cost \nshare as approved.”  Moreover, “the Federal agency should incorporate discussion of these \npolicies  into  its  outreach activities  with  applicants  before posting  a  notice  of  funding \nopportunity.”  Id. \nC. Congress’s Refinements Of The Indirect Cost Structure And NSF’s Response. \n57.  Congress has been active in  determining what proportion of research costs \nuniversities should bear and when agencies may use fixed rates to approximate indirect costs.  In \n1962, as explained above, Congress authorized the use of “predetermined fixed-percentage rates” \nfor “payment of reimbursable indirect costs” attributable to research agreements with educational \ninstitutions.  Act of Sept. 5, 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-638, 76 Stat. 437, codified at 41 U.S.C. § 4708.  \nThis authorization was essential because, in 1956, the Comptroller General issued an opinion \n \nissues/frequently-asked-questions-about-facilities-and-administrative-costs.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 23 of 40\n \ndisallowing the “payment of overhead based on a stipulated percentage of direct labor or other \ncosts . . . in lieu of reimbursement of the actual costs of overhead.”  35 Comp. Gen. 434 (1956). \n58.  Shortly thereafter, Congress imposed a 20% cap on the amount of indirect costs \nthat agencies could reimburse.  Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1965, Pub. L. No. 88-\n507, § 303, 78 Stat. 640, 666 (1964); see Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1963, Pub. L. \nNo. 87-742, § 304, 76 Stat. 716, 740 (1962).  But just a few years later, Congress lifted that cap \nand replaced it with more general language indicating that “[n]one of the funds provided herein \nshall be used to pay any recipient of a grant for the conduct of a research project an amount equal \nto as much as the entire cost of the project”—in short, requiring at least some cost sharing.  \nIndependent Offices Appropriation Act, 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-128, § 303, 79 Stat. 520, 543 \n(1965).  In 2005, Congress eliminated even that more general requirement. \n59.  In the wake of these congressional actions, NSF until now has created policies that \nsought to carefully follow the lead that Congress by statute had set.  For example, NSF’s Proposal \nand Award Policies and Procedures Guide—which is cross-referenced in NSF’s regulations \nimplementing OMB’s uniform guidance, see 2 C.F.R. § 2500.100—specifies that “it is NSF \npolicy that recipients are entitled to reimbursement from award funds for indirect costs” pursuant \nto the recipients’ “current Federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement.”  NSF, Proposal and \nAward  Policies  and Procedures Guide X-5  (effective May  20,  2024) (“Award  Guide”), \nhttps://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/nsf24_1.pdf.   \n60.  The Award Guide also narrowly limits “[m]andatory cost sharing”—which means \nthat a recipient must cover part of the cost of the research.  Id. at II-21.  “Mandatory cost sharing \nwill only be required for NSF programs when explicitly authorized by the NSF Director, the NSB, \nor legislation.”  Id.  The Award Guide further states that “[e]xcept where specifically identified \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 24 of 40\n \nin an NSF program solicitation, the applicable U.S. Federally negotiated indirect cost rate(s) must \nbe used in computing indirect costs (F&A) for a proposal. Use of an indirect cost rate lower than \nthe organization’s current negotiated indirect cost rate is considered a violation of NSF’s cost \nsharing policy.”  Id. at II-20 (emphasis added). \n61.  The NSF’s cost sharing policy—which appears to have recently disappeared from \nNSF’s website—states that “[m]andatory programmatic cost sharing will rarely be approved for \nan NSF program,” and that “[a]ny program that would like to request consideration of mandatory \nprogrammatic cost sharing requirement in an NSF  solicitation must develop a compelling \njustification regarding  why  non-Federal financial support and  commitment is  considered \nfoundational to programmatic success.”  NSF, Implementation of the 2nd NSB Cost Sharing \nReport: NSF Revised Cost Sharing Policy Statement, https://web.archive.org/web/20250307\n184941/https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/csdocs/principles.pdf \nD. Recent Attempts By The Executive Branch To Limit Indirect Cost Rates. \n \n62.  In 2017, the Administration released a budget proposal that would have slashed \nthe indirect cost rate for NIH grants to 10%.  See Office of Management & Budget, Major Savings \nand Reforms: Budget of the U.S. Government Fiscal Year 2018, at 43 (2017), https://www.gov\ninfo.gov/content/pkg/BUDGET-2018-MSV/pdf/BUDGET-2018-MSV.pdf. \n63.  The proposal spurred widespread and bipartisan criticism and alarm.  Congress \nthen enacted, on a bipartisan basis, an appropriations rider providing that regulatory “provisions \nrelating to indirect costs . . . including with respect to the approval of deviations from negotiated \nrates, shall continue to apply to the National Institutes of Health to the same extent and in the \nsame manner as  such provisions were applied in the  third quarter of fiscal year 2017.”  \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, § 226, 132 Stat. 348, 740.  The \nappropriations rider also prohibits spending appropriated funds “to develop or implement a \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 25 of 40\n \nmodified approach to” the reimbursement of “indirect costs” and “deviations from negotiated \nrates,” or to “intentionally or substantially expand the fiscal effect of the approval of such \ndeviations from negotiated rates beyond the proportional effect of such approvals in such \nquarter.”  Id. \n64.  The House Report noted that, “[w]hile the Committee appreciates the Secretary’s \nefforts to  find efficiencies in  NIH  research  spending, the  Administration’s proposal to \ndramatically reduce and cap reimbursement of facilities and administrative (F&A) costs to \nresearch institutions is misguided and would have a devastating impact on biomedical research \nacross the country.”  H.R. Rep. No. 115-244, at 50.  The Senate Report noted, “[t]he methodology \nfor negotiating indirect costs has been in place since 1965, and rates have remained largely stable \nacross NIH grantees for decades.  The Administration’s proposal would radically change the \nnature of the Federal Government’s relationship with the research community, abandoning the \nGovernment’s long-established responsibility for underwriting much of the Nation’s research \ninfrastructure, and jeopardizing biomedical research nationwide.  The Committee has not seen \nany details of the proposal that might explain how it could be accomplished without throwing \nresearch programs across the country into disarray.”  S. Rep. No. 115-150, at 109. \n65.  Congress has repeatedly reenacted the rider ever since.   See Department of \nDefense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and \nContinuing Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub. L. No. 115-245, § 224, 132 Stat. 2981, 3094; Further \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Pub. L. No. 116-94, § 224, 133 Stat. 2534, 2582 (2019); \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. 116-260, § 224, 134 Stat. 1182, 1594 (2020); \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-103, § 224, 136 Stat. 49, 470-71; \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, § 224, 136 Stat. 4459, 4883-84 \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 26 of 40\n \n(2022).  And this rider remains in effect to this day, in the now-operative statute.  See Further \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, div. D, tit. II, § 224, 138 Stat. 460, \n677. \n66.  The negotiated NIH indirect cost rates remained undisturbed until late on Friday, \nFebruary 7, 2025, when NIH issued a Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grants Policy \nStatement: Indirect Cost Rates (“NIH Rate Change Notice”).  NIH purported to cap previously \nnegotiated indirect cost rates on all existing and future grant awards for biomedical research, with \nan effective date of February 10, 2025.  Three groups—a group of 22 states, a group of five \nmedical associations, and a group of 17 higher education associations and individual universities, \nincluding some of the plaintiffs in this case—filed complaints and motions for temporary \nrestraining orders.  Following briefing, the Court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction on \nMarch 5, 2025.  NIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *1.  The Court held that the dispute was justiciable; \nthat the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their arguments that the NIH Rate Change Notice \nviolated  the  applicable  regulations,  the  appropriations rider,  and  the  APA’s  reasoned-\ndecisionmaking requirements; that the plaintiffs demonstrated irreparable harm; and that the \nbalance of the equities and public interest favored an injunction.  The parties then jointly moved \nto convert the preliminary injunction to a permanent injunction.  See NIH, No. 25-CV-10338 (D. \nMass. Apr. 4, 2025), ECF No. 96.  The government has not moved for a stay pending appeal. \n67.  Despite this decision, on April 11, 2025, the DOE announced its own policy almost \nidentical to the one the NIH promulgated in February.  The policy declared that the DOE “will no \nlonger use the negotiated indirect cost rate” for universities, instead “setting a standardized 15 \npercent indirect cost rate for all grant awards.” DOE, Policy Flash: Adjusting Department of \nEnergy Grant Policy for Institutions of Higher Education (IHE), supra.  DOE also stated that it \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 27 of 40\n \nwas “undertaking action to terminate all grant awards to [universities] that do not conform with \nthis updated policy.”  Id.  Faced with losing either a significant portion or all their grant funding, \nnine universities and three associations representing universities challenged the DOE policy under \nthe APA.  The universities and associations filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, which \na federal district court granted on April 16, 2025, to prevent immediate and irreparable harm. AAU, \n2025 WL 1119791, at *1.  The parties filed further briefing on the motion for the temporary \nrestraining order, and the court held a hearing on the motion on April 28, 2025.  The temporary \nrestraining order remains in place pending further order of the court. \nE.  NSF’s New Rate Cap Policy. \n68.  On Friday, May 2, 2025, NSF issued its Rate Cap Policy, titled “Implementation \nof Standard 15% Indirect Cost Rate.”  The Rate Cap Policy announces that NSF “is updating its \npolicy regarding the reimbursement of indirect costs in federally funded financial assistance,” \nand that “[e]ffective May 5, 2025, NSF will apply a standard indirect cost rate not to exceed 15% \nto all grants and cooperative agreements awarded to IHEs for which indirect costs are allowable.” \nEx. A (footnote omitted).  Although framed as a “maximum,” the 15% cap is in fact vastly lower \nthan universities’ negotiated indirect cost rates and is thus in substance an across-the-board 15% \nmandate. \n69.  The Rate Cap Policy provides that “[t]he 15% rate maximum applies only to new \nawards made to IHEs on or after May 5, 2025,” and that “NSF funding opportunities issued after \nMay 5, 2025, will include notice of this indirect cost rate policy.”  Id. (emphasis omitted). \n70.  The Rate Cap Policy purports to rely on the authority of 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c) for \nits setting of a single, uniform indirect cost rate maximum of 15% for all institutions of higher \neducation.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 28 of 40\n \n71.  The Rate Cap Policy is a final agency action under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \nThe Rate Cap Policy: (1) “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” \nand (2) is action “by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal \nconsequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  In particular, the Rate Cap Policy marks the consummation of NSF’s decision-making \nprocess because it announces NSF’s decision to immediately impose a 15% across-the-board \nindirect cost rate maximum to institutions of higher education.  And the Rate Cap Policy is an \naction by which rights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences \nwill flow because it purports to limit the percent of indirect costs for which a grant recipient can \nbe reimbursed under the grant. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Contrary to Law \n(Violation of Authorizing Statutes) \n72.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.   \n73.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not \nin accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n74.  NSF has congressionally delegated authority to award research funds pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1862.  Specifically, Congress has “authorized and directed” NSF to “initiate and \nsupport basic scientific research and programs to strengthen scientific research potential.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 1862(a).  Congress has further authorized NSF to “initiate and support scientific and \nengineering research, including applied research, at academic and other nonprofit institutions.”  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 29 of 40\n \nId. § 1862(c).  Congress made clear that “[i]n exercising the authority and discharging [these] \nfunctions,” one of NSF’s “objectives” “shall be . . . to strengthen research and education in the \nsciences and engineering, including independent research by individuals, throughout the United \nStates.”  Id. § 1862(e).  In addition, NSF is required by statute to create and carry out programs \nto award funds for particular types of research, including “research leading to transformative \nadvances in  manufacturing technologies,” id.  § 1862p-1(a), and “research into green  and \nsustainable chemistry,” id. § 1862p-3. \n75.  Congress has authorized “predetermined fixed-percentage rates” for “payment of \nreimbursable indirect costs” attributable to research agreements with educational institutions like \nthose contemplated by NSF’s authorizing statutes as described in the foregoing paragraphs.  Act \nof Sept. 5, 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-638, 76 Stat. 437, codified at 41 U.S.C. § 4708. \n76.  Congress has not authorized NSF to adopt a categorical rate cap that arbitrarily \nsets a 15% maximum regardless of actual indirect costs.   \n77.  The  Rate  Cap  Policy  violates  41  U.S.C.  § 4708  because  it  imposes  a \n“predetermined fix-percentage rate[]” that does not attempt to approximate actual “reimbursable \nindirect costs.”   \n78.  The Rate Cap Policy exceeds NSF’s statutory authority by reimposing, in more \nsevere form, a categorical cap on indirect costs that Congress specifically eliminated in 1965 and \nhas declined to reenact ever since. \n79.  The Rate Cap Policy violates the governing statutes by replacing the tailored \nprocess Congress has created by statute with a categorical, one-size-fits-all cap.  The Supreme \nCourt has underscored that agencies may not enact sweeping rules of this sort without express \ncongressional authorization.  In considering whether agency action is authorized by statute, courts \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 30 of 40\n \nconsider whether the “‘history and the breadth of the authority that [the agency] has asserted’” \nand the “‘economic and political significance’ of that assertion” counsel in favor of “‘hesitat[ing] \nbefore concluding that Congress’ meant to confer such authority.”  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. at 721 (quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 159-60 (2000), \nsuperseded by statute as stated in FDA v. Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C., 145 S. Ct. 898 \n(2025)); see also MCI Telecomms. Corp., 512 U.S. 218.  In Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477 \n(2023), for example, the Court held that the government could not use a tailored waiver authority \nto wipe out student loans wholesale and so “unilaterally alter large sections of the American \neconomy.”  Id. at 507.  Likewise here, no statute expressly authorizes NSF to depart from the \ntailored approach Congress has created to devastate the very research NSF has been authorized—\nand indeed required—to promote and fund.   \n80.  Because Congress did not expressly authorize NSF to make this unilateral change, \nthe Rate Cap Policy is invalid.  \nCount II \n \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Contrary to Law \n(Illegal Departure from Negotiated Cost Rates in Violation of 2 C.F.R. 200.414) \n \n81.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n82.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not \nin accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n83.  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1) states that negotiated indirect cost rates “must be \naccepted by all Federal agencies.  A Federal agency may use a rate different from the negotiated \nrate for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 31 of 40\n \nstatute or regulation, or when approved by the awarding Federal agency in accordance with \nparagraph (c)(3) of this section.”   \n84.  In turn, 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3) states: “The Federal agency must implement, and \nmake publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their \nprograms will follow to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.”   \n85.  By pronouncing a single, uniform “policy” setting an indirect cost rate maximum \nfor universities at 15% regardless of the otherwise applicable negotiated rate, NSF violated 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1) and (c)(3).     \n86.  First,  these provisions authorize agencies to announce procedures governing \nsubsequent decisions to make individualized deviations from the baseline negotiated rate.  They \ndo not authorize NSF to make a unilateral decision to impose an arbitrary cap on the rate \napplicable to all universities that does not attempt to approximate actual indirect costs.   \n87.  Second, these regulations authorize deviations for “either a class of Federal \nawards or a single Federal award.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1).  The Rate Cap Policy jettisons \nnegotiated rates for a class of recipients—universities—and not a class of awards.  Moreover, \neven if the regulations permitted deviations for a “class of Federal award[] [recipients],” the Rate \nCap Policy would violate this limit because it applies to universities that collectively account for \nover 80% of NSF’s total R&D obligations. \n88.  Third,  Section  200.414(c)(3) authorizes “deviations” from negotiated  rates.  \nAuthority to provide for “deviations” does not empower NSF to eliminate the standard use of \nnegotiated rates across broad swathes of institutions; rather, negotiated rates must remain the \nnorm, with deviations just narrow exceptions.  Cf. MCI Telecomms. Corp., 512 U.S. at 228-29 \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 32 of 40\n \n(holding that statutory authority to “modify” a requirement “does not contemplate fundamental \nchanges”); Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. at 494-95 (similar).    \n89.  Fourth, insofar as NSF applies the Rate Cap Policy to new awards issued after \nMay 5, 2025, for which the notice of funding opportunity did not identify the departure from the \nnegotiated rate, the Policy violates Section 200.414(c)(4).   \nCount III \n \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Contrary to Law \n(Illegal Departure from Cost Recovery Regulations) \n90.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.   \n91.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not \nin accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n92.  Federal  regulations  and  decades  of  Executive  Branch  practice  establish \nsubstantive and procedural guidelines governing the recovery of indirect costs, which NSF’s Rate \nCap Policy blatantly violates. \n93.  Substantively, the governing regulations dictate that grantees will recover the \nactual indirect costs that are reasonable and allocable to federal projects.  The bedrock principle \nis: “The total cost of a Federal award is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable indirect \ncosts minus any applicable credits.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.402. The regulations establish detailed \nguidelines designed to ensure that grantees recover their actual allocable indirect costs.  See \ngenerally 2 C.F.R. § 200.414; accord 2 C.F.R. pt. 200, app. III(A) (“Indirect (F&A) costs are \nthose that are incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily \nand specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other \ninstitutional activity”); 2 C.F.R. pt. 200, app. III(A)(2)(e)(1) (“Indirect (F&A) costs are the broad \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 33 of 40\n \ncategories of costs discussed in Section B.1.”).  By slashing indirect cost rates to 15% without \nregard to whether that percentage tracks actual indirect costs, NSF violated the regulations. \n94.  Procedurally, federal regulations prescribe a complex process for negotiating an \nindirect cost recovery rate.  Institutions must document and submit costs in painstaking detail to \nsupport that process.  Subpart E of part 200 of Title 2 “establishes principles for determining \nallowable costs incurred by recipients and subrecipients under Federal awards.”  2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.100(c).  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(e) stipulates that a set of appendices will set forth in detail \n“[r]equirements for development and submission of indirect cost rate  proposals and cost \nallocation plans.”  Those appendices contain “the documentation prepared by a recipient to \nsubstantiate its request to establish an indirect cost rate.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.1 (definition of “Indirect \ncost rate proposal”).  For universities, Appendix III to Part 200 establishes the criteria for \nidentifying and computing indirect facilities and administration costs for Institutions of Higher \nEducation (IHEs).  Id. § 200.414(e)(1).  The Appendix details the processes for a grant recipient \nto document a significant range of costs and how those costs should be allocated among multiple \ngovernment projects. Audits are the mechanism then used to determine what is charged to a \nfederal award.  2 C.F.R. § 200.501(b) requires that a “non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 \nor more in Federal awards during the non-Federal entity’s fiscal year must have a single audit \nconducted in accordance with § 200.514,” except if it elects to have a program-specific audit.  \nThis audit is performed annually, and it must be conducted in accordance with articulated \nstandards.  See 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.504, 200.514.  An auditor may identify any “[q]uestioned cost,” \nwhich is defined as “an amount, expended or received from a Federal award, that in the auditor’s \njudgment:” (1) “[i]s noncompliant or suspected noncompliant with Federal statutes, regulations, \nor the terms and conditions of the Federal award;” (2) “[a]t the time of the audit, lacked adequate \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 34 of 40\n \ndocumentation to support compliance;” or (3) “[a]ppeared unreasonable and did not reflect the \nactions a prudent person would take in the circumstances.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.1 (definition of \n“Questioned cost”).  The results of the audit and any questioned costs are factored into negotiation \nof indirect cost rates.  See Appendix III to Part 200. \n95.  NSF ignored that detailed process.  Instead, it arbitrarily determined that all \nuniversities would recover at most a 15% rate, violating the regulations’ substantive commands \nand rendering that entire regulatory process meaningless. \nCount IV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious \n96.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.   \n97.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n98.  The Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious for many reasons, including the \nfollowing. \n99.  First,  NSF’s  justification  is  conclusory and  violates  NSF’s  obligation  to \n“examine[] ‘the relevant data’ and articulate[] ‘a satisfactory explanation’ for [the] decision, \n‘including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Dep’t of Com. \nv. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 (2019) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of United States, Inc. \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  One, the Policy says it “reduce[s] \nadministrative burdens for awardee institutions,” ignoring that institutions must still negotiate \nindirect cost rate agreements with other agencies, that NSF and other agencies must still negotiate \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 35 of 40\n \nsuch agreements with non-university recipients, and that—in all events—slashing indirect cost- \nrates to a flat 15% imposes harms on awardees that vastly outweigh any reduced administrative \nburden.  Ex. A.  Two, the Policy says it “[e]nsures consistent treatment of all IHE financial \nassistance  recipients,”  ignoring  that  the  negotiated-rate  process  does  treat  universities \nconsistently by tailoring indirect cost rates to actual indirect costs, that the Policy creates \ninconsistency by treating institutions with very different research portfolios the same, and that \nthe  Policy  irrationally  disfavors universities  by  capping  their  indirect  cost  rates  when \nnonuniversity recipients seeking the very same awards may receive higher rates.  Id.  Three, the \nPolicy says it “[i]ncrease[es] the proportion of federal funds allocated to direct research costs” \nand “ensure[s] that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research \nactivities,” ignoring that indirect costs are necessary for research to take place and often differ \nfrom direct costs only in that they fund multiple research projects.  Id.  The Policy also says it \n“align[s] with common federal benchmarks,” apparently referring to the 15% “de minimis” rate \nin 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(f)—arbitrarily applying a rate for institutions that have not offered \n“documentation to justify” a particular rate to institutions that have documented substantially \nhigher rates. \n100.  Second, the Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious because it ignores obvious \nproblems with its categorical 15% cap.  The Policy does not provide a rationale for subjecting \ndifferent institutions to a  single  uniform rate that  ignores actual indirect costs, does not \nacknowledge that indirect costs are critical to supporting and maintaining world-class research, \nand ignores how imposing a categorical 15% rate cap will devastate research nationwide and \nwill—in so doing—thwart the goals that NSF by statute must pursue.  Moreover, an across-the-\nboard 15% rate cap amounts to a decision to fund only some of the costs of research NSF supports, \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 36 of 40\n \nand ultimately amounts simply to a decision to fund less research of particular types—including \nresearch that relies heavily on unique, expensive facilities and specially skilled staff, as cutting-\nedge research often does.  NSF’s failure to acknowledge these obvious problems is especially \negregious because the Rate Cap Policy ignores Congress’s on-point actions and statements: Not \nonly did Congress expressly reject categorical caps in 1965 and 2017, but the reasons that \nCongress did so apply equally to NSF’s categorical cap.   \n101.  Third, the Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious because it ignores the \nreliance interests of the research institutions receiving federal funding and does not provide an \nexplanation that accounts for those reliance interests.  Typical indirect cost rates negotiated with \nthe government by research universities range from 50% to 65%.  The Rate Cap Policy thus \nslashes indirect cost recovery by up to three quarters.  Universities have structured their budgets \non the understanding that federal agencies will pay their legally required cost reimbursements \naccording to the longstanding practice of using negotiated indirect costs and rates.  Universities \nhave accordingly made costly decisions about long-term investments, such as what physical \ninfrastructure should be built, in reliance on negotiated rates with federal agencies, as well as the \nOMB regulations generally requiring agencies to use a negotiated indirect cost rate and permitting \ndeviations from that rate only in narrowly limited circumstances.   \n102.  Fourth, the Rate Cap Policy departs without acknowledgment or explanation from \nNSF’s policy on mandatory cost sharing.   NSF has narrowly limited mandatory cost sharing, \nrecognizing the problems that cost sharing creates.  For example, when NSF imposes cost- \nsharing, it fails to fund the full costs of the research it sponsors in a manner that NSF has \nacknowledged is rarely appropriate.  And cost sharing favors certain applicants over others for \nreasons unrelated to their ability to effectively carry out the research.  Moreover, NSF has long \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 37 of 40\n \nacknowledged that limits on reimbursement of indirect costs are in effect mandatory cost- \nsharing.  The Rate Cap Policy does not acknowledge how it conflicts with NSF’s policy on \nmandatory cost sharing or the judgments underlying that policy. \n103.  Fifth, the Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious because it reflects a new \npolicy resting upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay the prior policy of OMB \nand NSF and that are also wrong.  The prior policy rested on the view that a uniform indirect cost \nrate maximum was not appropriate, and that negotiated rates should be both institution-specific \nand—in most cases—substantially higher.  The Rate Cap Policy provides no explanation for this \nreversal in course. \n104.  Sixth, the Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious because NSF fails to explain \nwhy its own audits of indirect costs would not accomplish the task of “improv[ing] government \nefficiency.”  Ex. A.  To the contrary, because audits look at specific costs, they can accomplish \nwhat NSF’s indiscriminate policy cannot—identifying specific costs that can be appropriately \ncurtailed.   \n105.  Seventh, the Rate  Cap  Policy  is  arbitrary and capricious because, without \nexplanation, it imposes its new categorical 15% cap only on universities, and not on other NSF \ngrant recipients.  If (counterfactually) this categorical cap improved efficiency or reflected \nresponsible stewardship of federal funds, NSF does not explain why it imposed that policy on \nonly universities.  This failure is especially irrational because universities and other institutions \noften seek the same NSF awards, and yet the Rate Cap Policy applies only to university awardees. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the following relief:  \na.  Expedited resolution of this action to prevent harm to Plaintiffs; \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231     Document 1     Filed 05/05/25     Page 38 of 40\n \nb.  Vacatur of the Rate Cap Policy; \nc.

For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ request for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED, and Plaintiffs’ request for a \nPreliminary Injunction is DENIED as moot. \nI.  Background \nA.  The National Science Foundation and Grant-Supported Research  \nThe National Science Foundation Act of 1950, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1861, et seq. (“NSF Act”), \nestablished the National Science Foundation (“NSF”). Congress has authorized and directed \nNSF: \nto initiate and support basic scientific research and programs to strengthen scientific \nresearch potential and science education programs at all levels in the mathematical, \nphysical, medical, biological, social, and other sciences, and to initiate and support \nresearch fundamental to the engineering process” and programs to strengthen such \nresearch, by making contracts or other arrangements (including grants . . . ) to \nsupport such scientific, engineering, and educational activities . . .  \n42 U.S.C. § 1862(a)(1). Congress has also specifically authorized NSF “to initiate and support \nscientific and engineering research . . . at academic . . . institutions.” Id. § 1862(c). Almost \nseventy years later, Congress reaffirmed the essential nature of federal research grants, including \n“the sense of Congress that . . . sustained, predictable Federal funding of basic research is \nessential to United States leadership in science and technology[.]” American Innovation and \nCompetitiveness Act, Pub. L. No. 114-329, § 101(a)(1) 130 Stat. 2969, 2970 (2017). \n  Under the NSF Act, NSF has statutory authority “to enter into contracts or other \narrangements, or modifications thereof, for the carrying on, by organizations or individuals in the \nUnited States and foreign countries, . . . of such scientific or engineering activities as [NSF] \ndeems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter[.]” 42 U.S.C. § 1870(c). Further, “[i]n \nmaking contracts or other arrangements for scientific or engineering research,” Congress has \ndirected NSF to: \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 3 of 52\nutilize appropriations available therefor in such manner as will in its discretion best \nrealize the objectives of (1) having the work performed by organizations, agencies, \nand institutions, or individuals in the United States or foreign countries, including \nGovernment agencies of the United States and of foreign countries, qualified by \ntraining and experience to achieve the results desired, (2) strengthening the research \nstaff of organizations, particularly nonprofit organizations, in the United States, (3) \nadding  institutions,  agencies,  or  organizations  which,  if  aided,  will  advance \nscientific or engineering research, and (4) encouraging independent scientific or \nengineering research by individuals.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1873(e). \nB.  Statutory Provisions Related to Public Contracts \n  The relevant statutory scheme also includes a generally-applicable provision related to \npublic contracts, codified at Title 41 of the United States Code. Under 41 U.S.C. § 4708, “[a] \ncost-type research and development contract (including a grant) with a university, college, or \nother educational institution may provide for payment of reimbursable indirect costs on the basis \nof predetermined fixed-percentage rates applied to the total of the reimbursable direct costs \nincurred or to an element of the total of the reimbursable direct costs incurred.” \n  According to the Senate Report accompanying the proposed legislation, the bill allowed \nindirect cost rates to be set in advance as estimates of future costs, as had been the practice prior \nto a 1956 decision of the Comptroller General, rather than be retroactively adjusted after the fact \nbased on actual costs, as had been the practice following that decision. S. Rep. No. 87-1826, at 1 \n(1962).   \nC.  The Regulatory Scheme for Federal Grants \nUnder regulations promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), \nagencies initiate a competitive grantmaking process by issuing a notice of funding opportunity \n(“NOFO”) for a specific research program. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.204. The agency receives \napplications for a period specified in the NOFO, which is typically at least 60 days. Id. \n§ 200.204(b). The agency then conducts a “merit review process” to select grant recipients who \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 4 of 52\nare “most likely to be successful in delivering results based on the program objectives . . . .” Id. \n§ 200.205. After an agency selects a grant recipient, it issues a Notice of Award (“NOA”) \nindicating the amount of funds awarded to the recipient. Id. § 200.211(c)(1)(iv).  \nThe regulations provide for detailed cost accounting for grants. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, \nApp. III (“Indirect (F & A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for \nInstitutions Of Higher Education (IHEs)”) (“Appendix III to Part 200”); 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.1, \n200.414, 200.501(b), 200.504, 200.514. The regulations provide for two categories of costs: \n“allowable direct and allocable indirect costs[.]” 2 C.F.R. § 200.402.  \nDirect costs are those “that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost \nobjective, such as a Federal award . . . or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively \neasily with a high degree of accuracy.” 200 C.F.R. § 200.413(a). Indirect costs are those \n“incurred for a common or joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective and not readily \nassignable” to a specific project. 2 C.F.R. § 200.1. Indirect costs must be designated as either \n“facilities” or “administration.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.414. “‘Facilities’ is defined as depreciation on \nbuildings, equipment and capital improvements, interest on debt associated with certain \nbuildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses.” Id. \n“‘Administration’ is defined as general administration and general expenses such as the \ndirector’s office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically \nunder one of the subcategories of ‘Facilities.’” Id. Whether direct or indirect, to be reimbursed, \ncosts must “[b]e necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award” and must \nbe adequately documented. 2 C.F.R. § 200.403. \n“The total cost of a [f]ederal award is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable \nindirect costs minus any applicable credits.” See 2 C.F.R. § 200.402. Generally, an institution \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 5 of 52\nnegotiates a pre-determined indirect cost rate with a federal agency. 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III \n(C)(4) (“[N]egotiation of predetermined rates for indirect (F & A) costs for a period of two to \nfour years should be the norm . . . where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available \nare deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the \nprobable level of indirect (F & A) costs during the ensuing accounting periods.”) Federal \nregulations prescribe procedures and methodology for negotiating and determining the indirect \ncost rate. See generally 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III(C). An IHE negotiates its indirect cost rate \nwith the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) or the Department of Defense’s \n(“DOD”) Office of Naval Research (“ONR”), normally depending on which of the two agencies \nhas provided more funds directly to the educational institution for the most recent three years. 2 \nC.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III(C)(11)(a)(1). Where neither HHS nor ONR provides federal funding \ndirectly to an IHE, the cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment to that IHE defaults to \nHHS. Id. IHEs do not negotiate indirect cost rates with NSF. \nNegotiated rates are effective for a specified period, often (but not always) between two \nand four years. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C)(4). Entities that expend more than $1,000,000 \nin federal awards must be audited. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.501, 200.504, 200.514. An institution’s \ncovered indirect costs may be adjusted if an audit indicates that an institution has received \nfunding in excess of its actual costs. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III(C)(11)(d) (“The cognizant \nagency for indirect costs must conduct any necessary negotiations with an educational institution \nregarding amounts questioned by audit that are due the Federal government related to costs \ncovered by a negotiated agreement.”). \nWhere an indirect cost rate has not been negotiated, an IHE may elect to cover indirect \ncosts by charging a de minimis indirect cost rate of up to 15%. 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(f). The de \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 6 of 52\nminimis rate does not require documentation by the IHE to justify the costs. Id. Use of a de \nminimis rate for indirect costs is at the election of the IHE, and federal agencies “may not require \nrecipients . . . to use a de minimis rate lower than the negotiated indirect cost rate . . . unless \nrequired by Federal statute or regulation.” Id. \nThe regulations detail federal agency acceptance of negotiated cost rates. See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.414(c). Subsection (c)(1) provides first that “[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must be \naccepted by all Federal agencies.” (Emphasis added). The regulation then allows federal agencies \ncertain deviations from the accepted, negotiated rates “for either a class of Federal awards or a \nsingle Federal award” in two circumstances: when a different rate is required by federal statute \nor regulation, or when the awarding federal agency approves a different rate in accordance with \nspecific procedures, see id., as discussed in detail below.  \nD.  NSF Awards \nThe grant review process at NSF typically takes six months for technical review plus one \nmonth for final administrative review. Coughlin-Piester Decl. ¶ 8 [Doc. No. 61]. Over 80% of \nNSF research grants are awarded to IHEs and about 5% are awarded to other nonprofit \norganizations. See id. ¶ 6 [Doc. No. 61] (stating NSF awarded approximately 9,400 of 11,000 \ncompetitive new and renewal grant awards to IHEs); Nat’l Ctr. for Sci. & Eng’g Statistics, \nSurvey of Federal Funds for Research and Development (2023-2024), Table 7, \nhttps://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/federal-funds-research-development/2023-2024# tableCtr13393 \n(last accessed June 20, 2025).2 In Fiscal Year 2024, the average approval rate for grant proposals \n \n \n2 About 7% of funds are awarded to businesses, and less than 1% to state and local governments \nand non-U.S. performers.

No. \n61] \nNSF grant recipients generally do not receive lump sum funding. Instead, recipients first \nincur expenses and then, using cost-based accounting systems, recover their actual, documented \ncosts for conducting research. See id. ¶ 10 (explaining NSF grants “reimburse . . . costs on an as-\nneeded basis based on costs a grantee incurs or expects to incur during a given period”). \nGenerally, NSF has paid indirect costs in grants to IHEs based on indirect cost rates that those \ninstitutions negotiate with ONR or HHS.

NSF’s Indirect Cost Policies and the Policy Notice \nNSF has included on its website its “Indirect Cost Rate Policies” explaining indirect \ncosts. See NSF’s Indirect Cost Rate Policies [Doc. No. 40-42]. The website explains that indirect \ncosts are “those costs which are not readily identifiable with a particular cost objective . . . but \nnevertheless are necessary for the general operation of an organization.” Id. at 3–4. The website \nexplains further that “[o]rganizations generally charge indirect costs to federal awards by \ndeveloping and applying an indirect cost rate, which is used consistently across an organization’s \nawards.” Id. at 4. The website states further that “[a] predetermined indirect cost rate is a fixed \nrate established for a future fiscal period, based on the actual costs from a representative prior \nperiod.” Id. at 5. \nAdditionally, NSF’s Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide specifies that “it \nis NSF policy that recipients are entitled to reimbursement from award funds for indirect costs,” \nwhich is “generally based upon a recipient’s current Federally negotiated indirect cost rate \nagreement.” NSF, Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide X-5 (effective May 20, \n2024), https://nsfgov-resources.nsf.gov/files/nsf24_1.pdf? (“Award Guide”) (last accessed June \n20, 2025). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 12 of 52\nOn May 2, 2025, NSF issued its Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% Indirect \nCost Rate, NSF 25-034.4 The Policy Notice’s subject is: “Adoption of Standard 15% Indirect \nCost Rate for NSF Grants and Cooperative Agreements awarded to Institutions of Higher \nEducation (IHEs).” Id. at 1. The Policy Notice states that a 15% cap on indirect costs will apply \nto new awards made to IHEs on or after May 5, 2025. Id. The Policy Notice also asserts that \nNOFOs NSF issues after the effective date will include notice of the 15% cap on indirect cost \nrates. Id. \nThe Policy Notice acknowledges that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is a change to NSF’s \npolicy regarding reimbursement of indirect costs, and states that the change “is intended to \nstreamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed \ntoward direct scientific and engineering research activities.” Id. at 2. The Policy Notice states \nthat it “serves as public notification of the policies, procedures and general decision-making \ncriteria that NSF has used to justify deviation from negotiated rates for all awards[.]” Id. at 2. As \nthe rationale for the deviation, the Policy Notice states that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate supports \nNSF’s commitment to efficiency, consistency, and effectiveness. Id. at 2. \nII.  Procedural History \nPlaintiffs filed this action against the NSF and its Acting Director Brian Stone on May 5, \n2025, challenging the Policy Notice and the 15% Indirect Cost Rate under the APA. See Compl. \n \n \n4 See https://www.nsf.gov/policies/document/indirect-cost-rate (accessed May 6, 2025, at 3:59 \np.m.). Plaintiffs state that a copy of this Policy Notice is attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint, \nsee Compl. ¶ 8 [Doc. No. 1], but the Complaint includes no Exhibit A. Defendants state that \nExhibit 1 to the Declaration of Janis Coughlin-Piester [Doc. No. 61] is a true and correct copy of \nthe May 2, 2025 Policy Notice, see [Doc. No. 61-1]. That version appears to have been accessed \nfrom the website on May 27, 2025, after the policy was stayed in connection with this lawsuit. \nSee id. at 1 (noting that “NSF is temporarily pausing implementation of the [Policy Notice]”).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 13 of 52\n¶¶ 72–105 [Doc. No. 1]. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate violates \nauthorizing statutes (Count I), departs from negotiated indirect cost rates in violation of 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.414 (Count II), departs from cost recovery regulations (Count III), and is arbitrary and \ncapricious (Count IV). Id. On May 8, Plaintiffs filed a combined Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction and for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 40] supported by declarations from \nrepresentatives of the Organizational Plaintiffs and their members, and from the University \nPlaintiffs. \nDefendants subsequently filed their own Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 60], \narguing that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated standing to sue, that this court lacks jurisdiction \nbecause NSF’s grant-related decisions are committed to agency discretion by law and are not \nreviewable under the APA, and that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is authorized by statute and \nsupported by reasoned explanation. Defendants’ Motion is supported by a declaration from the \nNSF’s Chief Financial Officer and Head of the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award \nManagement. \nDefendants have agreed to voluntarily stay implementation of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate \nthrough June 20, 2025. See Defs.’ Notice [Doc. No. 50]; Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 42 n.30 [Doc. \nNo. 62]. \nIII.  Standard of Review \nIn the administrative law context, a motion for summary judgment is “simply a vehicle to \ntee up a case for judicial review.” Bos. Redevelopment Auth. v. Nat’l Park Serv., 838 F.3d 42, \n47 (1st Cir. 2016). Therefore, “an inquiring court must review an agency action not to determine \nwhether a dispute of fact remains but, rather, to determine whether the agency action was \narbitrary and capricious” or otherwise unlawful. Id.; see Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. \nDaley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997) (explaining court’s task on summary judgment in \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 14 of 52\nadministrative law context “is only to determine” whether agency’s action was “consonant with \n[its] statutory powers, reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record”). \nIV.  Discussion \nA.  Jurisdiction \n1.  Standing \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because they have not established that any \nPlaintiff has suffered an injury in fact. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 12 [Doc. No. 62]. Defendants \ncontend that because the 15% Indirect Cost Rate applies only to new awards, any injury \nPlaintiffs can identify stems from potentially being offered a grant award at the 15% indirect cost \nrate (which they would have discretion to accept or reject), submitting proposals at that rate in \nthe future, or deciding not to submit grant proposals at that rate. Id. at 13. Defendants assert that \nclaims concerning hypothetical, future grants that Plaintiffs may or may not receive constitute \ngeneralized grievances about NSF’s policy, which are not sufficient to confer standing. Id. \nThe doctrine of standing is rooted in Article III of the Constitution, which confines \nfederal courts to the adjudication of actual “cases” and “controversies.” See U.S. Const. art. III, § \n2, cl. 1; TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021). “For a legal dispute to qualify \nas a genuine case or controversy, at least one plaintiff must have standing to sue.” Dep’t of Com. \nv. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 766 (2019).  \nEstablishing standing requires a showing that a plaintiff “has suffered, or will suffer, an \ninjury that is ‘[1] concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; [2] fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action; and [3] redressable by a favorable ruling.’” Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, \n57 (2024) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)).  \n“[A]n association may have standing solely as the representative of its members even in \nthe absence of injury to itself[.]” Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 15 of 52\nGoods Corp., 799 F.2d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1986). “[A]n association has standing to bring suit on \nbehalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own \nright; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual \nmembers in the lawsuit.” Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 \n(1977); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975) (“The association must allege that its \nmembers, or any one of them, are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the \nchallenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves \nbrought suit.”). \nWhether an association has standing to sue on behalf of its members “depends in \nsubstantial measure on the nature of the relief sought.” Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & \nAgr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 287 (1986) (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at \n515). Actions seeking prospective relief are generally “particularly suited to group \nrepresentation.” Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst., 799 F.2d at 12.  \nTo establish the first element of standing, an injury-in-fact, a plaintiff must demonstrate \n“an invasion of a legally protected interest” that is “not conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). “[A] person exposed to a risk of future harm \nmay pursue forward-looking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm from occurring, at least so \nlong as the risk of harm is sufficiently imminent and substantial.” TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 435.  \nHere, Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that University Plaintiffs and the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs have standing based on an imminent and substantial future injury to \nIHEs. Qualifying for less federal funding is a “future injur[y]” that is sufficient to confer \nstanding where “the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 16 of 52\nharm will occur.” Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767; accord New Jersey v. Trump, 131 F.4th 27, 37 \n(1st Cir. 2025); cf. Sherley v. Sebelius, 610 F.3d 69, 74 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (concluding plaintiffs \nhad standing where agency action increased competition for federal grants such that plaintiffs \n“face[d] a substantial enough probability [of losing funding] to deem the injury to them \nimminent”). Under the 15% Indirect Cost Rate, Organizational Plaintiffs and member \ninstitutions, including the University Plaintiffs, will have to cover a significant portion of their \nindirect costs for NSF research despite ONR and HHS’s recognition of those actual, indirect \ncosts, as reflected in the negotiated indirect cost rates. Defendants provide an example that \nillustrates: If NSF awards $100 in direct costs to an institution with whom ONR or HHS has \nnegotiated a 30% indirect cost rate, the total award is $130. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 29 [Doc. No. \n62]. But if NSF caps the indirect cost rate at 15%, the institution can only receive $15 in indirect \ncosts from the same grant award, for a total award of $115, with the institution responsible for \ncovering the remaining $15. See id. \nPlaintiffs have also demonstrated that this injury is sufficiently imminent. Even though \nthe 15% Indirect Cost Rate only cuts indirect costs as to future grants that NSF has not yet \nawarded, any IHE that has negotiated an indirect cost rate with HHS or ONR above 15% \nbecomes eligible for less federal funding if NSF implements the 15% Indirect Cost Rate.  \nNor is it merely hypothetical that at least some University Plaintiffs and members of the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs institutions will receive less indirect cost funding from NSF under the \n15% Indirect Cost Rate. Although no university is guaranteed to receive any grant award for \nwhich it applies, some University Plaintiffs (who are also members of the Organizational \nPlaintiffs) each have dozens of proposals pending, and NSFs average approval rate for grant \nproposals from IHEs was 27%. Coughlin-Piester Decl. ¶ 9 [Doc. No. 61]. Such institutions are \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 17 of 52\nhighly likely to receive at least a portion of the awards for which they have applied. Further, \nwhere members of the Organizational Plaintiffs received approximately $14.4 billion in awards \nin 2023, and where IHEs have received 80% of grants historically, the suggestion that no \nUniversity Plaintiff or member of an Organizational Plaintiff would be awarded any grant in the \nfuture is fanciful. Indeed, Defendants themselves point out that “[r]eview of awards from 2024 \ncan illustrate the impact of the policy on future awards. . . . If indirect costs had been limited to \n15% for IHEs in FY24, then, at the time of award, the budgeted indirect costs would have been \n$432,298,644 less.” Id. ¶ 18. Given the magnitude of awards to members of the Organizational \nPlaintiffs, it is highly likely that some members would be among the institutions affected. \nFurther, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate will cause a host of \nadditional injuries, beginning with a disruption to ongoing research. Although the 15% Indirect \nCost Rate does not affect existing or continuing grant awards, Plaintiffs and member institutions \ncollectively have thousands of proposals pending before NSF, which they submitted in reliance \non their negotiated indirect cost rates.

No. 40-22]; Oregon State Decl. ¶ 16 [Doc. No. 40-25]; Yale Decl.  ¶¶ 6–7, 17 [Doc. No. \n40-41]. Consequently, those projects would not occur under the 15% Indirect Cost Rate, either \nbecause NSF will deny proposals based on their reliance on negotiated indirect cost rates, or \nbecause a 15% indirect cost rate is insufficient to support the research. See, e.g., MIT Decl. ¶¶ \n11–12 [Doc. No. 40-19]. And if particular projects cannot proceed, progress in various research \nareas will be disrupted, and in some cases, will end, particularly where IHEs are reliant on new \ngrants to continue ongoing projects. See, e.g., Caltech Decl. ¶¶ 5–6 [Doc. No. 40-8] (15% \nIndirect Cost Rate will “end or seriously jeopardize” existing research developing new concepts \nin battery technology and other areas planned for renewal at the end of current funding period); \nsee also UChicago Decl. ¶ 19 [Doc.

See \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57 (2024) (explaining standing requirements “help ensure that \nthe plaintiff has ‘such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant \n. . . invocation of federal-court jurisdiction”) (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. \n488, 493 (2009)). \nDefendants do not contest traceability or redressability. Regardless, where the 15% \nIndirect Cost Rate reduces NSF funding for indirect costs on grants for which University \nPlaintiffs and members of the Organizational Plaintiffs are eligible, and where Plaintiffs seek an \norder vacating and enjoining implementation of that Policy, those elements are satisfied, and \nPlaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims.  \nDefendants also do not contest—and Plaintiffs have shown—that the Organizational \nPlaintiffs have standing to sue on behalf of their members. First, member institutions would have \nstanding to sue in their own right based on the injuries discussed above. Second, challenging the \n15% Indirect Cost Rate is germane to the Organizational Plaintiffs’ missions. AAU seeks to \n“provide a forum for the development and implementation of institutional and national policies \npromoting strong programs of academic research and scholarship . . . .” AAU Decl. ¶ 3 [Doc. \nNo. 40-1]. ACE’s mission includes advocating for public policies that support its members’ \ninterests in obtaining support for academic research. ACE Decl. ¶ 4 [Doc. No. 40-2]. And APLU \nadvocates for “public impact research” and strives to help university leaders emphasize the value \nof collaborative research with communities. APLU Decl. ¶ 4 [Doc. No. 40-3]. Where Plaintiffs \nargue that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate reduces the level of support available for necessary \nresearch costs and impedes university research programs, a lawsuit seeking to prevent \nimplementation of the Policy is consistent with the Organizational Plaintiffs’ stated goals. And \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 21 of 52\nwhere Plaintiffs’ suit seeks prospective relief and raises pure questions of law—i.e. whether the \n15% Indirect Cost Rate is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious—the court can determine \nPlaintiffs’ claims and craft appropriate relief without participation of member institutions. See \nBrock, 477 U.S. at 287–88.  \n2.  APA Jurisdiction \nDefendants claim that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate constitutes an exercise of agency \ndiscretion that is unreviewable under the APA and that this court therefore lacks jurisdiction. \nMem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 14 [Doc. No. 62].  \n“The APA ‘sets forth the procedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the \npublic and their actions subject to review by the courts.’” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of \nthe Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 16 (2020) (quoting Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, \n796 (1992). The APA thus waives sovereign immunity in actions “seeking relief other than \nmoney damages,” and provides a cause of action to those “suffering legal wrong because of \nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a \nrelevant statute.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. This language embodies a “basic presumption of judicial \nreview.” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 190 (1993) (quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, \n387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967)). The APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to the \nextent that “agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). At \nthe same time, the APA directs a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat it finds to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.” Id. § 706(2)(A) (emphasis added).  \nThe Supreme Court has noted “tension” between the command to set aside agency action \nthat constitutes an abuse of discretion and the prohibition of judicial review for actions \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 22 of 52\ncommitted to agency discretion, explaining that “[a] court could never determine that an agency \nabused its discretion if all matters committed to agency discretion were unreviewable.” \nWeyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 586 U.S. 9, 23 (2018). Consequently, “[t]o give \neffect to § 706(2)(A) and to honor the presumption of review,” the Court has “read the exception \nin § 701(a)(2) quite narrowly, restricting it to ‘those rare circumstances where the relevant statute \nis drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \nexercise of discretion.’” Id. (quoting Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191). Such circumstances exist where a \ncourt has “no law to apply” to an exercise of agency discretion. Citizens to Pres. Overton Park, \nInc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 \nU.S. 99 (1977). But where “[a]n agency issues an order affecting the rights of a private party, \nand the private party objects that the agency did not properly justify its determination under a \nstandard set forth in the statute[,]” the case presents “the sort of routine dispute that federal \ncourts regularly review.” Weyhaeuser, 586 U.S. at 23–24. \nFurther, the reviewability exception for discretionary agency action is generally limited to \n“certain categories of administrative decisions that courts traditionally have regarded as \ncommitted to agency discretion.” Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 772 (collecting cases). Such actions \ninclude an agency’s allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation, see Lincoln, 508 U.S. at \n191, or an agency’s decision not to reconsider a final action on the same record, see I.C.C. v. \nBhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs, 482 U.S. 270, 280 (1987).  \nNSF’s decision to stop awarding indirect costs based on the rates that ONR and HHS \nhave negotiated with IHEs is not of the type “traditionally regarded as committed to agency \ndiscretion.” The 15% Indirect Cost Rate does not allocate funds from particular appropriations. \nCf. Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 193–94 (holding allocation of lump-sum appropriation such that Indian \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 23 of 52\nChildren’s Program was discontinued was unreviewable); Milk Train, Inc. v. Veneman, 310 F.3d \n747, 749–51, (D.C. Cir. 2002) (holding agency’s chosen method to distribute appropriations to \nassist dairy farmers was unreviewable). Instead, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate dictates the terms of \ngrant awards—presumably without regard to the source from which the funds are awarded.  \nFurther, even construing the 15% Indirect Cost Rate as a decision allocating \nappropriations, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is reviewable because statutory standards cabin the \nagency’s exercise of the discretion Congress has given it. See Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 193 \n(“Congress may always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting \nrestrictions in the operative statutes . . . .”). The NSF Act gives NSF authority to enter into \ncontracts it “deems necessary to carry out” specific statutory purposes. 42 U.S.C. § 1870(c); see \nid. § 1873(e). NSF’s decision to cap indirect cost rates in grants to IHEs (and its reasoning for \nthat decision) is reviewable for consistency with those purposes. See California v. U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., 132 F.4th 92, 98 (1st Cir. 2025) denial of stay pending appeal rev’d on other grounds by \nDep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025).  \nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate is also reviewable where regulations—namely 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.414(c)—dictate when and how NSF may deviate from negotiated indirect cost rates. See \nCalifornia v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 132 F.4th at 97 (holding decision to terminate grants \nreviewable where regulation governed agency discretion to do so); Physicians for Soc. Resp. v. \nWheeler, 956 F.3d 634, 643 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (explaining regulations provide “judicially \nmanageable standards” that permit judicial review) (quoting Steenholdt v. F.A.A., 314 F.3d 633, \n638 (D.C. Cir. 2003)); e.g., Pol’y & Rsch., LLC v. United States Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \n313 F. Supp. 3d 62, 82–83 (D.D.C. 2018) (concluding agency regulations provided “meaningful \nstandards” for court to apply to review of agency’s shortening of grant award project period). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 24 of 52\nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate acknowledges that NSF is “deviati[ng] from negotiated rates for all \nawards” to IHEs. NSF Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% Indirect Cost Rate, NSF \n25-034. Under Section 200.414(c), NSF may only do so “when required by Federal statute or \nregulation, or when approved by [NSF] in accordance with” specific procedures. NSF’s \nimplementation of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is reviewable for compliance with those \nprocedures.  \nAt bottom, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is “an order affecting the rights of . . . private \npart[ies],” i.e. IHEs, where it deviates from those institutions’ negotiated indirect cost rates. \nThose parties’ challenge to the Policy on the grounds that NSF lacked authority to implement it \nand that the Policy is arbitrary and capricious presents “the sort of routine dispute that federal \ncourts regularly review.” See Weyhaeuser, 586 U.S. at 23–24. \nB.  The Merits \nThe APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency actions found to be \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to judgment on their APA claims for four \nreasons. First, Plaintiffs argue that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is contrary to the statutes that \nauthorize the NSF to award grants. Mem. ISO Mot. 19 [Doc. No. 41]. Second, Plaintiffs claim \nthat the 15% Indirect Cost Rate violates 2 C.F.R. § 200.414, which requires all federal agencies \nto accept negotiated indirect cost rates unless specific circumstances apply. Id. at 22. Third, \nPlaintiffs argue that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate violates regulatory requirements for indirect cost \nrecovery. Id. at 25. Finally, Plaintiffs argue the Policy is arbitrary and capricious. Id. at 27. \nDefendants oppose each of these arguments. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 25 of 52\n1.  Contrary to Authorizing Statutes (Count I) \nPlaintiffs argue that Congress has not authorized NSF to impose a cap on indirect cost \nrates that is “unmoored from actual indirect costs,” Reply ISO Pls.’ Mot. 4 [Doc. No. 63] \n(capitalization omitted), and that 41 U.S.C. § 4708 does not authorize the 15% Indirect Cost \nRate, Mem. ISO Pls.’ Mot. 19–22 [Doc. No. 41]. Defendants contend that the NSF Act and 41 \nU.S.C. § 4708 each provide NSF with statutory authority to cap indirect cost rates. See Mem. \nISO Defs.’ Mot. 2, 17 [Doc. No. 62]. Specifically, Defendants assert that the NSF Act grants the \nagency “broad authority to set the terms of its grants, including by requiring predetermined \nindirect cost rates that do not exceed 15 percent,” id. at 17, and that Section 4708 provides NSF \nauthority to fix the indirect cost rate at 15% where the statute “provides no guidance on which \npredetermined fixed-percentage rates may be used[.]” Id. at 18.  \n“Administrative agencies are creatures of statute,” and thus “possess only the authority \nthat Congress has provided. Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Lab., Occupational Safety & \nHealth Admin., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). Consequently, an agency “‘literally has no power to \nact’—including under its regulations—unless and until Congress authorizes it to do so by \nstatute.” Fed. Election Comm’n v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 301 (2022) (citations omitted).  \nIn determining whether Congress authorized a particular agency action, courts are not \nconfined to examining particular statutory provisions in isolation. FDA v. Brown & Williamson \nTobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132 (2000). “[T]he meaning of one statute may be affected by \nother Acts, particularly where Congress has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the \ntopic at hand.” Id. Relatedly, “[i]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific \ngoverns the general.” RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 \n(2012) (citation omitted). This canon applies where, as here, “a general authorization and a more \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 26 of 52\nlimited, specific authorization exist side-by-side” to avoid superfluidity of a more specific \nprovision that is swallowed by a general one. Id. In such cases, “[t]he terms of the specific \nauthorization must be complied with.” Id. \nThe text of the NSF Act does not address indirect costs at all. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1870(c), \nNSF has authority “to enter into contracts . . . for the carrying on, by organizations or individuals \nin the United States and foreign countries . . . of such scientific or engineering activities as the \nFoundation deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.” In making such contracts, \nNSF must “utilize appropriations available therefor in such manner as will in its discretion best \nrealize the objectives of (1) having the work performed by organizations, agencies, and \ninstitutions, or individuals . . . qualified by training and experience to achieve the results desired, \n(2) strengthening the research staff of organizations, particularly nonprofit organizations, in the \nUnited States, (3) adding institutions, agencies, or organizations which, if aided, will advance \nscientific or engineering research, and (4) encouraging independent scientific or engineering \nresearch by individuals.” 42 U.S.C. § 1873(e). Although these provisions provide NSF broad, \ngeneral grant-making authority, they do not address the methods by which NSF may provide for \nthe payment of indirect costs.  \nTo support their interpretation of the NSF Act, Defendants point out that NSF capped \nindirect cost rates at 15% in a 1951 regulation that first implemented NSF’s grant-making \nauthority. Mem ISO Defs.’ Mot. 17 [Doc. No. 62]; see 16 Fed. Reg. 12835, § 620.3 (Dec. 21, \n1951). But Defendants offer no information as to whether this regulation withstood judicial \nscrutiny and they do not contend that this regulation remained in place after it was first \npromulgated.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 27 of 52\nCongress subsequently implemented Section 4708, which does address agency authority \nto reimburse indirect costs at pre-determined rates. Where Section 4708 specifically governs \nagencies’ power to set predetermined indirect cost rates, and where the 15% Indirect Cost Rate \nsets a predetermined maximum indirect cost rate across grants to all IHEs, the relevant question \nis whether Section 4708 authorizes the 15% Indirect Cost Rate that NSF has promulgated. See \nRadLAX Gateway Hotel, 566 U.S. at 645.  \nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate limits the reimbursement of actual costs incurred by the \nawardee and is not authorized by the text of Section 4708. Section 4708 provides federal \nagencies authority to “provide for payment of reimbursable indirect costs on the basis of \npredetermined fixed-percentage rates applied to the total of the reimbursable direct costs incurred \nor to an element of the total of the reimbursable direct costs incurred.” 41 U.S.C. § 4708. This \nlanguage authorizes agencies (including NSF) to pay a grantee its “reimbursable indirect costs” \nusing a particular methodology (namely, a predetermined rate), but it does not authorize NSF to \ndetermine that it will not reimburse “reimbursable indirect costs.” By capping indirect cost rates \nfor IHEs at the de minimis rate, which is untethered from the actual indirect costs that an \ninstitution incurs and well below typical negotiated indirect cost rates, the 15% Indirect Cost \nRate effectively limits the portion of an IHE’s indirect costs that are reimbursable. In limiting the \nportion of an IHE’s indirect costs that NSF will reimburse, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate imposes \nindirect cost sharing on the institution. Section 4708 does not provide NSF authority to require \nindirect cost sharing. \nFurther, the Executive Branch has consistently read the language in Section 4708 to \nindicate that HHS and ONR should negotiate and set indirect cost rate with reference to an \ninstitution’s actual costs. Although it is not determinative, “the longstanding practice of the \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 28 of 52\ngovernment” is an interpretive aid that “can inform a court’s determination of what the law is.” \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 386 (2024) (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). Here, Executive guidance implementing the relevant statutory language has \nconsistently stated that HHS and ONR should negotiate predetermined indirect cost rates with \nIHEs where there is sufficient information to approximate the actual indirect costs the institution \nwill incur.5 And as recently as May 8, 2025, NSF itself understood “predetermined indirect cost \nrate” as “a fixed rate established for a future fiscal period, based on the actual costs from a \nrepresentative prior period.” NSF’s Indirect Cost Rate Policies 5 [Doc. No. 40-42] (emphasis \nadded).   \nDefendants respond that OMB revised its guidance regarding HHS and ONR’s negotiated \nindirect cost rates to cap the rate for “administrative costs” at 26% of an institution’s modified \n \n \n5 See Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants \nand Contract With Educational Institutions, 30 Fed.

Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 10, 19 [Doc. No. 62]; see OMB Circular A-21, Revised, \nPrinciples for Determining Costs Applicable to Grants, Contracts, and Other Agreements With \nEducational Institutions, 56 Fed. Reg. 50224, 50228 (Oct. 3, 1991). Plaintiffs contend that OMB \nrelied on an estimate of average actual costs across institutions to calculate that number, see \nReply ISO Pls.’ Mot. 6 [Doc. No. 63], and Defendants have not disagreed. Moreover, \n“administrative costs” may be classified as either direct or indirect costs. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, \nApp. III(6)(b) (providing guidelines for “the determination of departmental administrative costs \nas direct or indirect (F & A) costs”). And in any event, notwithstanding the cap on \n“administrative costs,” the portion of OMB’s current guidance that references Section 4708 \nmaintains that “negotiation of predetermined indirect rates for indirect [Facilities and \nAdministration] costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm” where there is \nsufficient “cost experience and other pertinent facts” to base that rate on the actual indirect costs \nan institution will probably incur. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III(C)(4). Accordingly, the court \ncannot conclude that this provision explicitly authorizes agencies to mandate indirect cost-\nsharing as Defendants’ 15% Indirect Cost Rate would do here. \nIn sum, the statutory text and executive interpretations of Section 4708 do not support \nDefendants’ contention that this statute authorizes NSF to set a flat rate across all IHEs that \nimposes cost-sharing and instead support Plaintiffs’ assertion that neither the NSF Act nor \nSection 4708 authorizes the 15% Indirect Cost Rate. However, to the extent Plaintiffs argue \nfurther that NSF is statutorily barred from imposing any across-the-board cap on indirect cost \nrates, the court declines to resolve the issue where the parties have not addressed whether 31 \nU.S.C. § 503 vests exclusive authority in OMB to establish policies regarding reimbursement of \nindirect research costs in federal grant awards, see id. § 503(a), (b)(2)(C), (c)(1)(A), and where \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 30 of 52\nthe 15% Indirect Cost Rate must in any event be vacated pursuant to each of Plaintiffs’ three \nfurther arguments. \n2.  Violation of 2 C.F.R. § 200.414 (Count II) \nPlaintiffs argue that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate violates 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c), which \nrequires NSF to accept negotiated indirect cost rates except in specific circumstances and after \ncomplying with certain requirements. Mem. ISO Pls.’ Mot. 22 [Doc. No. 41]. The court agrees. \nSection 200.414 establishes a clear norm regarding funding of indirect research costs: \nOnce an IHE negotiates an indirect cost rate with HHS or ONR, all agencies accept that rate. \nSection 200.414(c) provides: \n(1) Negotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal agencies. A \nFederal agency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for either a \nclass of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal \nstatute or regulation, or when approved by the awarding Federal agency in \naccordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. \n \n(2) The Federal agency must notify OMB of any approved deviations. The recipient \nor  subrecipient  may  notify  OMB  of  any  disputes  with  Federal  agencies \nregarding the application of a federally negotiated indirect cost rate. \n \n(3) The Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, \nprocedures and general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow \nto seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates. \n \n(4) The Federal agency must include, in the notice of funding opportunity, the \npolicies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement or cost share as approved \nunder paragraph (e). As appropriate, the Federal agency should incorporate \ndiscussion of these policies into its outreach activities with applicants before \nposting a notice of funding opportunity. \n2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c) (emphasis added). \nSection 200.414(f) reinforces that norm. Where a grant recipient or subrecipient does not \nhave a current negotiated indirect cost rate, that institution may elect to charge a de minimis rate, \nwhich can be no more than 15 percent of its modified total direct costs. 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(f). \n“Once elected, the recipient or subrecipient must use the de minimis rate for all Federal awards \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 31 of 52\nuntil the recipient or subrecipient chooses to receive a negotiated rate.” Id. But once an \ninstitution has a negotiated rate in place, “[f]ederal agencies . . . may not require recipients and \nsubrecipients to use a de minimis rate lower than the negotiated indirect cost rate[.]” Id.  \nWith the 15% Indirect Cost Rate, NSF has rejected the regulatory framework for funding \nindirect research costs and has limited the recovery of actual costs by imposing a de minimis rate \non IHEs with negotiated indirect cost rates with ONR or HHS in violation of Section 200.414(f). \nContrary to subsection 200.414(f), which allows for this rate only on the IHE’s election where \nthere is no negotiated rate, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate “app[lies] a standard indirect cost rate not \nto exceed 15%”—i.e. a de minimis rate—“to all grants and cooperative agreements awarded to \nIHEs for which indirect costs are allowable.” NSF Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard \n15% Indirect Cost Rate, NSF 25-034. \nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate is also inconsistent with Section 200.414(c)’s limitations on \nthe scope of permitted deviations from negotiated indirect cost rates. An agency may only \ndeviate from an IHE’s negotiated rate “for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal \naward[.]” 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c). “Class of Federal awards means a group of Federal awards \neither awarded under a specific program or group of programs or to a specific type of recipient or \ngroup of recipients to which specific provisions or exceptions may apply.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.1. It is \nconceivable to consider IHEs “a specific type of recipient.” But construing “a group of federal \nawards” to IHEs to encompass all awards to all IHEs would allow the exception to swallow the \nwhole.  \nNor is the 15% Indirect Cost Rate a “deviation” authorized by subsection (c)(3) if the \nword “deviation” is given its ordinary meaning. “Deviate” means “to stray . . . from a standard, \nprinciple, or topic” or “to depart from an established course or norm.” Deviate, Merriam-\n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 32 of 52\nWebster’s Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1993). But the 15% Indirect Cost Rate eliminates the \nexisting norm (acceptance of negotiated indirect cost rates) and imposes a new standard (a flat, \n15 percent cap on indirect cost rates) as to all NSF grants to IHEs with negotiated indirect cost \nrates. In NSF’s reading, the baseline requirement that “[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must be \naccepted by all Federal agencies[,]” is flatly ignored. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c) (emphasis \nadded). \nFurther, NSF has not complied with the process contemplated by Section 200.414(c) for \ndeviating from negotiated indirect cost rates. As an initial matter, where subsection (c)(4) \nrequires that a NOFO include “policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement,” the 15% \nIndirect Cost Rate violates that subsection to the extent that it applies to grant opportunities for \nwhich NSF had issued a NOFO before it announced the 15% Indirect Cost Rate. Defendants \neffectively concede this, arguing that they need not comply with this requirement because “it \nsays nothing about what should happen in the event of noncompliance.” Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. \n23 [Doc. No. 62]. But the APA does impose a consequence for agency action that fails to comply \nwith applicable regulations: a reviewing court shall set that action aside. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate otherwise violates Section 200.414(c) where NSF announced \nand imposed a cap on indirect cost rates in one fell swoop. The language in Section 200.414(c) \nrequires agencies to follow a sequential process in deviating from negotiated indirect cost rates. \nAs two other sessions in this District have explained, “[t]he provision states that the awarding \nagency seeking a deviation ‘“must”—present tense—make available the policies, procedures, \nand decision-making criteria that [it] “will follow”—future tense—to seek and justify the \ndeviation.’” Ass’n of Am. Universities v. Dep’t of Energy, 2025 WL 1414135, at *15 (D. Mass. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 33 of 52\nMay 15, 2025) (quoting Massachusetts v. NIH, 770 F. Supp. 3d 277, 298 (D. Mass. 2025)).6 \nContrary to subsection (c)(3), the Policy Notice states that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate makes \npublic “the policies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that NSF has used”—past \ntense—“to justify deviation from negotiated rates[.]” NSF Policy Notice: Implementation of \nStandard 15% Indirect Cost Rate, NSF 25-034 (emphasis added). \nAdditionally, there is no indication that NSF “approved” the 15% Indirect Cost Rate in \nthe manner required by subsection (c)(1). The Federal Register notice promulgating Section \n200.414(c) explains that the regulation “provides for the consistent application of negotiated \nindirect cost rates, and articulates the conditions under which a Federal awarding agency may \nuse a different rate[,]” which “include approval . . . based on documented justification” in \naddition to the conditions set forth in subsections (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4). Uniform \nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 78 \nFed. Reg. 78590, 78600 (Dec. 26, 2019) (emphasis added). The Federal Register notice explains \nfurther that a proposal to require OMB to approve all deviations from negotiated rates was \nrejected on the basis that “the conditions set by OMB for these determinations are stringent \nenough to ensure that they do not occur without strong justification.” Id. (emphasis added). As \nexplained in more detail below, the administrative record before the court, which includes only \nthe Policy Notice for the 15% Indirect Cost Rate itself, see Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. to \nExpedite 3 [Doc. No. 47], does not indicate NSF deviated from the indirect cost rates negotiated \nby HHS and ONR and imposed a 15% cap based on a “strong” or “documented justification.” \nInstead, it merely concludes that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate will effectuate several agency goals \n \n \n6 The NIH court was discussing a different regulation, 45 C.F.R. § 75.414(c), which is similar to \n2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c). \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 34 of 52\nwithout information indicating how NSF determined that the Policy will help accomplish those \ngoals.  \nIn sum, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is not a deviation permitted by Section 200.414(c), \nand NSF failed to implement it in accordance with the procedures that the regulation prescribes.  \n3.  Departure from Cost Recovery Regulations (Count III) \nPlaintiffs assert that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is inconsistent with the regulatory \nframework governing recovery of indirect costs. Mem. ISO Pls.’ Mot. 25 [Doc. No. 41]. \nSpecifically, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate departs from the “existing, complex process for \nnegotiating an indirect cost recovery rate.” Id. at 26.  \nDefendants’ response is largely premised on the assumption that the 15% Indirect Cost \nRate is otherwise compliant with Section 200.414(c): They assert that the regulatory framework \ncannot prohibit the 15% Indirect Cost Rate where Section 200.414(c) “expressly allows” it. \nMem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 24 [Doc. No. 62]. Further, Defendants argue that invalidating the 15% \nIndirect Cost Rate, which they characterize as a “deviation from negotiated rates[,]” on the \nground that it is inconsistent with provisions governing negotiations of indirect cost rates would \nnullify Section 200.414(c), which permits deviations from negotiated rates. Mem. ISO Defs.’ \nMot. 26 [Doc. No. 62].  \nAs explained above, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is not a permissible deviation from \nnegotiated indirect cost rates. Consequently, Defendants’ argument fails to the extent it relies on \nSection 200.414(c). \nDefendants also argue that the law imposes no requirement that grantees recover in full \ntheir actual indirect costs, explaining that predetermined indirect cost rates implemented under \nSection 4708 will not necessarily reflect the actual indirect costs associated with a particular \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 35 of 52\nfederal award. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 24 [Doc. No. 62]. True, but as explained above, Section \n4708 does not authorize the use of indirect cost rates that require an institution to bear a share of \nits indirect costs. Further, “[a]n agency may not . . . simply disregard rules that are still on the \nbooks.” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). And here, the Uniform \nGuidance for computing indirect cost rates for IHEs imposes a detailed process in which \nagencies engage with individual institutions that includes steps designed to calculate negotiated \nrates that approximate actual indirect costs. See, e.g., 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III(A)(2)(d)(1) \n(“Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the method or [cost distribution base \nperiod] to be used in distributing individual cost groupings.”); id. (“The essential consideration \nin selecting a base is that it be the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost \nobjectives in accordance with benefits derived; with a traceable cause-and-effect \nrelationship . . . .”); id. App. III(C)(1)(a)(3) (explaining “each allocation method used to identify \nand allocate the indirect (F&A) cost pools . . . must contain the full amount of the institution’s \nmodified total costs or other appropriate units of measurement used to make the computations” \nand “the final rate distribution base . . . for each major function . . . must contain all the programs \nor activities which utilize the indirect (F & A) costs allocated to that major function”). The 15% \nIndirect Cost Rate ignores that process and the rates negotiated by HHS and ONR, which are \nbased on demonstrated actual indirect research costs approved by HHS and DOE, and imposes \ninstead a de minimis rate for all IHEs without regard to the actual indirect costs that IHEs incur. \nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate thus deviates from a regulatory framework that ties indirect cost \nrates to actual indirect costs.   \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 36 of 52\n4.  Arbitrary and Capricious (Count IV) \nPlaintiffs argue that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate’s justifications are conclusory and \nalternatively nonsensical. Mem. ISO Pls.’ Mot. 27 [Doc. No. 41]. Defendants respond that the \nPolicy sets out NSF’s reasons for the policy change and explains how it will accomplish those \ngoals, whereas Plaintiffs merely express disagreement with NSF’s decision, which is insufficient \nto satisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot.27–28 [Doc. No. 62].  \nUnder the APA, courts must “hold unlawful and set aside” an agency action, findings, \nand conclusions that are arbitrary or capricious. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). “An agency’s decision is \narbitrary and capricious if the agency relied on improper factors, disregarded an important aspect \nof the problem, offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence, or when a reasonable \nexplanation for the agency’s decision cannot be discerned.” Gulluni v. Levy, 85 F.4th 76, 82 (1st \nCir. 2023) (internal quotations and citations omitted). “[A] court ‘is not to substitute its judgment \nfor that of the agency’ but rather determine ‘whether there has been a clear error of judgment.’” \nId. (quoting Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 513). Though the scope of review is narrow,7 \nthe agency must “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its \naction.” Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 513 (citation omitted). And an agency cannot \n“entirely fail[] to consider an important aspect of the problem.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of \nU.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n \n \n7 Defendants argue that “a particularly lenient standard of review” applies “to agency action in \nthe contracting context,” citing a case from the Court of Federal Claims. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot \n27 [Doc. No. 62]; see Palantir USG, Inc. v. United States, 129 Fed. Cl. 218, 260–61 \n(2016), aff’d, 904 F.3d 980 (Fed. Cir. 2018). However, that case involved an agency’s exercise \nof discretion in soliciting and selecting bids during a particular procurement process. See id. at \n261. That case thus has no relevance here, where Plaintiffs challenge an agency’s decision to \nimplement a new policy that applies across its entire grant-making program.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 37 of 52\nThere is no heightened standard of review where an agency changes its policy. Fox \nTelevision Stations, 556 U.S. at 514–15. However, “the requirement that an agency provide \nreasoned explanation for its action . . . demand[s] that it display awareness that it is changing \nposition,” and the agency must show that there are “good reasons” for the new policy. Id. at 515 \n(emphasis in original). Further, an agency must provide a more detailed justification than would \nsuffice for a policy “created on a blank slate” where “its new policy rests upon factual findings \nthat contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy has engendered \nserious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” Id. In such cases, “a reasoned \nexplanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered \nby the prior policy.” Id. at 516. \nIn determining whether the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is arbitrary and capricious, the court \nis limited to considering the administrative record; “courts may not accept appellate \ncounsel’s post hoc rationalizations for agency action.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50. In this case, \nthe record consists only of the Policy Notice for the 15% Indirect Cost Rate. See Defs.’ Opp’n to \nPls.’ Mot. to Expedite 3 [Doc. No. 47].  \nThe Policy Notice acknowledges that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is an update to NSF’s \npolicy “regarding the reimbursement of indirect costs in federally funded financial assistance.” \nNSF Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% Indirect Cost Rate, NSF 25-034. It \ncontinues, “[t]his change is intended to streamline funding practices, increase transparency, and \nensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research \nactivities.” Id. As rationale, the Policy Notice states: \nThis policy supports NSF’s commitment to: \n•  Efficiency: Reducing administrative burdens for awardee institutions. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 38 of 52\n•  Consistency: Ensuring consistent treatment of all IHE financial assistance \nrecipients. \n•  Effectiveness: Increasing the proportion of federal funds allocated to direct \nresearch costs. \nThis policy allows NSF and its awardees to focus more on scientific progress and \nless on administrative overhead by aligning with common federal benchmarks. \nApplying a standard indirect cost rate also improves government efficiency by \neliminating the need for individualized indirect cost negotiations. \nId.  \nThese statements express goals and conclusions, not reasoning. To be sure, pursuing \nefficiency, consistency, and effectiveness are valid agency objectives. But “[s]tatements of \naspirational goals . . . are not the same as reasoned explanations for why an action is chosen or \nhow the chosen action will effectuate the stated goals.” Dep’t of Energy, 2025 WL 1414135, at \n*12. The 15% Indirect Cost Rate is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to explain how NSF \nconcluded it will further the objectives it asserts. \nFirst, NSF has not explained how it will achieve efficiency in the grant awards process. \nNSF is not the agency that negotiates indirect cost rates with IHEs. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. \nIII(C)(11)(a)(1). The 15% Indirect Cost Rate does nothing to eliminate any burden on other \nagencies that do negotiate indirect cost rates, or on universities that must still negotiate rates with \nother agencies. And NSF still must negotiate indirect cost rates for organizations that are not \nIHEs. See NSF, NSF’s Indirect Cost Rate Policies, https://www.nsf.gov/funding/proposal-\nbudget/indirect-costs (last visited May 6, 2025) (explaining NSF negotiates indirect cost rate \nagreements “for ~100 organizations”); see also Defs.’ Notice in Response to Court’s Inquiry 2 \n[Doc. No. 74] (for-profit grantees may recover indirect costs). In light of the apparent continuing \nneed for government agencies—including NSF—to continue to negotiate indirect cost rates, the \ncourt cannot discern how NSF concluded that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate will “eliminate the \nneed for individualized indirect cost negotiations.” \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 39 of 52\nSecond, NSF failed to explain how the 15% Indirect Cost Rate “[e]nsur[es] consistent \ntreatment of all IHE financial assistance recipients.” IHEs incur different amounts of indirect \ncosts, and thus negotiate different indirect cost rates reflecting those different actual costs. And \ninstitutions incur varying levels of indirect costs based on the type of research they perform, and \nthe sort of facilities that research requires. The existing framework thus provides consistency \namong IHEs in that it strives to ensure that no IHE bears a disproportionate amount of its indirect \ncosts because of the type of research that it pursues and that all IHEs have indirect costs covered. \nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate seemingly does the opposite: IHEs will be forced to bear differing \nshares of their actual indirect costs depending on the facilities and administration resources that \ntheir research requires.  \nThird, the court cannot discern how NSF determined that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate will \nmake NSF grant funding more effective. While the 15% Indirect Cost Rate states that it will \n“[i]ncreas[e] the proportion of federal funds allocated to direct research costs,” it is doing that by \nensuring that IHEs will not be fully reimbursed for research costs. Nor is it clear that IHEs could \nutilize that funding if they need to cost-share as this 15% Indirect Cost Rate requires. The \nuncontradicted record demonstrates that many Plaintiffs and member institutions would have to \nreject or stop applying for NSF funding because their research cannot proceed at the 15% \nindirect cost rate. See, e.g., AAU Decl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-1] (explaining members “will often \nhave to choose not to apply for future awards—as many institutions will not be able to sustain \nthe research . . . at that rate”); UNH Decl. ¶ 13 [Doc. No. 40-3] (“The University of New \nHampshire has already been notified of one award it will likely not be able to accept at a 15% \nindirect cost rate simply because there are no other sources of funds to cover the indirect costs of \nthat research.”); MIT Decl. ¶ 12 [Doc. No. 40-19]; UNR Decl. ¶ 23 [Doc. No. 40-22]; Vanderbilt \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 40 of 52\nDecl. ¶ 15 [Doc. No. 40-37]. Because it is unclear how NSF concluded that its change in policy \nwill make funding “more effective,” the Policy is not sufficiently explained. See NIH, 770 F. \nSupp. 3d at 305 (finding justification that policy would ensure more funds go toward direct \nscientific research costs was conclusory where agency “fail[ed] to address how the money [not \nspent on indirect costs] will actually be directed to cover direct costs and how that research will \nbe conducted absent the necessary indirect cost reimbursements provided by the federal \ngovernment”). \nIn sum, because the court cannot discern from the Policy Notice how NSF concluded the \n15% Indirect Cost Rate would further NSF’s stated goals, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is arbitrary \nand capricious. See Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 514. \nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate is also arbitrary and capricious because it ignores important \naspects of the problem, namely NSF’s statutory directive to “support basic scientific research and \nprograms to strengthen scientific research potential and scientific education programs.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 1862(a)(1); see Gulluni, 85 F.4th at 82;. The Policy Notice asserts that 15% Indirect \nCost Rate “allows NSF and its awardees to focus more on scientific progress and less on \nadministrative overhead by aligning with common federal benchmarks.” NSF Policy Notice: \nImplementation of Standard 15% Indirect Cost Rate, NSF 25-034. NSF is entitled to reach its \nown judgment as to how to best accomplish its statutory goals. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. \nat 515 (explaining an agency “need not demonstrate . . . that the reasons for the new policy \nare better than the reasons for the old one”) (emphasis in original). But NSF must explain how it \ncame to that judgment. See id. at 513 (explaining an agency must “examine the relevant data and \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action”) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43). Here it \ndid not. The Policy Notice includes no support for its assertion that “aligning with common \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 41 of 52\nfederal benchmarks”—presumably referring to the de minimis indirect cost rate—allows \nawardees to focus more on scientific progress. Nor does it explain how NSF’s decision to cap the \namount of actual indirect research costs incurred by IHEs will allow them to focus less on \nadministrative overhead. These are critical deficiencies where the de minimis rate bears no \nrelationship to the actual indirect costs required to perform much of the research that leads to \nsuch progress. \nFurther, the Policy Notice offers insufficient explanation because it fails to meaningfully \naddress Plaintiffs’ reliance interests. As Defendants point out, the Policy Notice acknowledges \nthe 15% Indirect Cost Rate is an update to NSF’s approach to indirect cost funding and does not \napply to existing or continuing grants that NSF has already awarded. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 30 \n[Doc. No. 62]; see NSF Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% Indirect Cost Rate, NSF \n25-034. But Plaintiffs’ reliance interest extends beyond its dependence on the terms of existing \ngrants. Though Plaintiffs are not entitled to receive future NSF grants at their negotiated indirect \ncost rates, nor are they guaranteed to receive any particular NSF grant award, “longstanding \npolicies may . . . engender[] serious reliance interests” that the agency must take into account \nwhen it decides to change that policy. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., \n591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). And an agency must \nconsider such reliance interests even where the policy at issue “confer[s] no substantive rights.” \nSee id. at 31.  \nIndeed, Plaintiffs have long relied on NSF’s policy, which NSF failed to meaningfully \naddress in eliminating it. Specifically, Plaintiffs and member universities have relied on NSF’s \nlongstanding approach to indirect cost rates in making long-term financial commitments, hiring \nand compensating staff, building and maintaining facilities, and generally advancing their \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 42 of 52\nscientific agendas. See, e.g., Caltech Decl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-8]; CU Decl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-\n12]; Dartmouth Decl. ¶ 10 [Doc. No. 40-15]; Florida Decl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-16]; UIC Decl. \n¶ 18 [ Doc.

The Policy Notice does not acknowledge this, asserting \nonly that “[i]nstitutions are not required to amend budgets for awards issued before [the] \neffective date, nor will they be required to return previously reimbursed indirect costs.” NSF \nPolicy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% Indirect Cost Rate, NSF 25-034 (emphasis \nremoved). \nWhere, as here, there has been “decades of industry reliance” on NSF’s prior policy, NSF’s \nsummary treatment of that reliance interest “[falls] short of the agency’s duty to explain why it \ndeemed it necessary to overrule its previous position[,]” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 \nU.S. 211, 223 (2016), and NSF failed “to assess whether there were reliance interests, determine \nwhether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against competing policy concerns,” \nRegents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. at 33. \nPlaintiffs offer a host of additional reasons why the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is arbitrary \nand capricious: it departs from the NSF’s policy against mandatory cost sharing, it rests upon \nunexplained factual findings that contradict those behind the NSF’s prior policy, it fails to \nexplain why the auditing process would not achieve government efficiency, and it singles out \nuniversities without explanation. Mem. ISO Mot. 30–32 [Doc. No. 41]. These are all examples of \nthe overarching problem: Defendants have not sufficiently explained why they concluded \ncapping indirect cost rates for IHEs at 15% will further the objectives stated in the Policy Notice. \nFor instance, NSF need not demonstrate that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate will better achieve \ngovernment efficiency than the audit-and-recovery process. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 43 of 52\n515. But NSF does need to explain why NSF believes the 15% Indirect Cost Rate provides a \nbetter approach, particularly where affected institutions have long relied on NSF’s existing \npolicy. See id. In failing to do so, the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is not sufficiently reasoned. \nC.  The Nature and Scope of Relief \n1.  Vacatur or Remand  \nDefendants argue that if the court concludes that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate does not \ncomply with all relevant statutes and regulations and is not reasonable and reasonably explained, \n“any remedy should be limited to remand” to NSF. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 33 [Doc. No. 62] \n(capitalizations omitted).  \nCourts need not necessarily vacate agency action that is inadequately explained. Allied-\nSignal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993); accord \nCent. Maine Power Co. v. FERC, 252 F.3d 34, 48 (1st Cir. 2001). Under the APA, remand is \ngenerally the proper remedy “[i]f the record before the agency does not support the agency \naction, if the agency has not considered all relevant factors, or if the reviewing court simply \ncannot evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it[.]” Fla. Power & \nLight Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985); see I.N.S. v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 16 \n(2002) (explaining court generally should remand to an agency “for decision of a matter that \nstatutes place primarily in agency hands”). Whether to vacate the action “rests in the sound \ndiscretion of the reviewing court,” Cent. Maine Power, 252 F.3d at 48, and depends on “the \nseriousness of the order’s deficiencies (and thus the extent of doubt whether the agency chose \ncorrectly) and the disruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.” Int’l \nUnion, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 920 F.2d 960, 966–\n67 (D.C. Cir. 1990); accord Cent. Maine Power, 252 F.3d at 48 (1st Cir. 2001).  \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 44 of 52\nHere, these factors weigh against remand. As explained above, the deficiencies in NSF’s \nreasoning are severe. Further, NSF committed errors of law that cannot be mended without \naltering the 15% Indirect Cost Rate; the court has determined that the Policy is directly contrary \nto the relevant regulations and is not authorized by the relevant statutes. Accordingly, remand is \ninsufficient. And where vacating the 15% Indirect Cost Rate, which NSF voluntarily stayed, \nkeeps in place NSF’s longstanding policy regarding indirect research cost reimbursement, \nvacatur is not a disruptive “interim change.” Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am., 920 F.2d \nat 966–67. \nAlthough Defendants suggest that the court only remand the matter, they do recognize \nthat, based on the court’s findings that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is unlawful, vacatur would be \nappropriate. See Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 33–34 [Doc. No. 62]. This concession is unremarkable: \nThe APA empowers federal courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that, as \nrelevant here, the reviewing court finds to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law; . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right; [and] without observance of procedure required by law[.]” \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2). “The Federal Government and the federal courts have long understood \n§ 706(2) to authorize vacatur of unlawful agency rules[.]” Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors \nof Fed. Rsrv. Sys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). Accordingly, “[t]he \nnormal remedy for a successful APA challenge is vacatur of the rule and its applicability to all \nwho would have been subject to it.” NIH, 770 F.Supp.3d at 329 (collecting cases). Here, the \ncourt finds the 15% Indirect Cost Rate unlawful and sets it aside, granting Plaintiffs’ request for \nvacatur of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 45 of 52\n2.  Declaratory Judgment \nPlaintiffs also seek a Declaratory Judgment that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate is invalid, \narbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. Defendants disagrees on the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims but offer no opposition to a declaratory judgment as an appropriate remedy based on the \ncourt’s findings. Accordingly, the court also grants Plaintiffs’ request for a declaratory judgment. \n3.  Injunctive Relief   \nPlaintiffs also request a permanent injunction “[(a)] prohibiting Defendants, their agents, \nand anyone acting in concert or participation with Defendants from implementing, instituting, \nmaintaining, or giving effect to the 15% Indirect Cost Rate in any form, including in rejecting or \ntreating adversely proposals for NSF funding submitted at universities’ negotiated rates rather \nthan the 15% rate; and [(b)] from otherwise modifying negotiated indirect cost rates except as \npermitted by statute and by the regulations of OMB.” Mem. ISO Pls.’ Mot. 40 [Doc. No. 41]. \nPlaintiffs argue that nationwide relief is necessary to provide complete relief where “nearly every \nU.S. university is either a party to this case or a member of a party.” Reply ISO Pls.’ Mot. 19 \n[Doc. No. 63].  \nDefendants claim Plaintiffs’ requested injunction is improper for two reasons: (1) it could \nbe read as prohibiting NSF from ever promulgating a rule setting the indirect cost rate at 15% \neven if it later provides a reasoned explanation that satisfies the APA’s requirements; and (2) \nPlaintiffs have not shown that their harms cannot be adequately addressed by vacatur and \nremand. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot 33–34 [Doc. No. 62]. Defendants also urge the court to limit any \nremedy to Plaintiff institutions, or institutions represented by Plaintiff associations, that have \nshown irreparable harm, asserting that “universal injunctions” violate Article III, “stretch \ntraditional principles of equity[,]” and “take a toll on the federal court system.” Id. at 43.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 46 of 52\nAs set forth below, Plaintiffs have established the need for nationwide relief, but the court \nfinds that vacatur and a declaratory judgment will address Plaintiffs’ harms such that a \npermanent injunction is not necessary.  \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated the prerequisites for equitable relief. To obtain a permanent \ninjunction, “[a] plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that \nremedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that \ninjury; 3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a \nremedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a \npermanent injunction.” Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 156–57 (2010) \n(citation omitted). The final two factors merge when the government is the opposing party. Nken \nv. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (factors merge in stay context); accord NIH, 770 F. Supp. \n3d at 295 (factors merge in preliminary injunction context); Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Dep’t of \nJust., __ F. Supp. 3d __, 2025 WL 1276857, at *47 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025) (factors merge in \npermanent injunction context).  \nAs explained in Section IV.A.1 above, Plaintiffs will suffer a variety of harms from the \n15% Indirect Cost Rate, including disruption of ongoing research, loss of essential and \nspecialized staff, and disruption to hiring, budgeting and planning. Those harms are irreparable. \nSee New York v. Trump, 133 F.4th 51, 73 (1st Cir. 2025) (denying stay of preliminary \ninjunction where district court found plaintiffs would “would irreparably suffer . . . impediments \nto planning, hiring, and operations[,] and disruptions to research projects by state universities”) \ncf. Bos. Celtics Ltd. P’ship v. Shaw, 908 F.2d 1041, 1048 (1st Cir. 1990) (concluding losing \nservices of athlete with “unique skill and ability” would constitute irreparable harm).  \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 47 of 52\nDefendants suggest Plaintiffs injuries are financial and redressable with monetary relief, \nciting two declarations from institutions indicating that they can cover funding deficiencies \ncaused by the 15% Indirect Cost Rate for some amount of time. See Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 37 \n[Doc. No. 62]. That argument may have some bearing in opposing a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in a non-APA case, but is of no moment here, where the court is considering the need \nfor a permanent injunction, and money damages are, in any event, unavailable under the APA. \nAnd contrary to Defendants’ suggestion, the significant weight of the declarations demonstrates \nthat, because of donor restrictions, competing demands, lack of surplus, and other limitations, \nendowments and other funding sources are insufficient to compensate for reduced indirect cost \nfunding from NSF such that Universities cannot avoid the irreparable injuries discussed above. \nSee, e.g., APLU Decl. ¶ 16 [Doc. No. 40-3]; BU Decl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-6]; UC Decl. ¶ 18 \n[Doc. No. 40-7]; Caltech Decl. ¶ 21 [Doc. No. 40-8]; Carnegie Mellon Decl. ¶ 21 [Doc. No. 40-\n9]; Colorado State Decl. ¶¶ 20, 22 [Doc. No. 40-13]; Illinois Decl. ¶¶ 23–25 [Doc. No. 40-17]; \nKansas Decl. ¶¶ 22–23 [Doc. No. 40-18]; UNR Decl. ¶¶ 21–22 [Doc. No. 40-22]; Pitt Decl. ¶ 18 \n[Doc. No. 40-28]; Toledo Decl. ¶¶ 18–19 [Doc. No. 40-34]; Utah Decl. ¶¶ 22–23 [Doc. No. 40-\n36]; Vanderbilt Decl. ¶¶ 20–21 [Doc. No. 40-37]; Vermont Decl. ¶¶ 20, 22 [Doc. No. 40-38]; \nWashington Decl. ¶¶ 21–22 [Doc. No. 40-39]. And even where institutions can replace lost NSF \nfunding from other sources, the reallocation of existing resources disrupts University budgeting \nprocesses, which is an irreparable injury itself.  \n  Further, the fact that Plaintiffs are not guaranteed any particular future NSF award does \nnot render their claims of injury speculative or conjectural:  \n[The agency] and IHEs co-exist in a symbiotic, mutually beneficial relationship, \nfostered over decades, which is built on the [agency’s] need for cutting edge \nresearch and the IHEs’ ability to provide it. As a result of this relationship, each \nIHE has a reasonable, non-speculative assumption that it will obtain future grants \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 48 of 52\nbecause, through the past grants and its own investment, it has built the highly \ntechnical, often one-of-a-kind infrastructure needed to conduct the research with \nthe assistance of those future grants, as well as assembled a team of specially \ntrained, uniquely qualified researchers and support staff needed to operate and \nmaintain that equipment. These grants are forthcoming to IHEs because, unless the \nDOE intends to stop funding this type of research, they must be. The [15% Indirect \nCost Rate] itself manifests an intent on the [agency’s] part to continue funding \nIHEs; all that has changed is that the [agency] now wants IHEs to foot more of the \nbill, without regard to the individual circumstances and overhead costs of each IHE, \nwhich Plaintiffs have adequately established they cannot do. \nDep’t of Energy, 2025 WL 1414135, at *19. Here, Plaintiffs and member institutions have \nlongstanding funding relationships with NSF, and the agency has long accepted their negotiated \nindirect cost rates. IHEs have made long-term financial commitments, developed research \ninfrastructure, and engaged in multi-year budgeting processes in reliance on that relationship. \nSee, e.g., Caltech Decl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-8]; Dartmouth Decl. ¶ 10 [Doc. No. 40-15]; Florida \nDecl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-16]; UIC Decl. ¶ 18 [ Doc. No. 40-17]; Michigan Decl. ¶ 16 [Doc. No. \n40-20]; UNR Decl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-22]; UNH Decl. ¶ 16 [Doc. No. 40-23]. Given that NSF \nhas long accepted IHEs’ negotiated indirect cost rates, it is reasonable for Plaintiffs and member \ninstitutions to rely on that policy in research planning and development. And because those \ninstitutions have developed infrastructure to support NSF research, they can expect to receive \nNSF funding in the future, even if they are not guaranteed a particular award.  \nNor are Plaintiffs’ injuries merely “downstream consequences” of the 15% Indirect Cost \nRate. See Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 38 [Doc. No. 62]. Instead, the lost opportunities and disruption \noccurs with the implementation of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate. Plaintiffs have thus demonstrated \nirreparable harm without an adequate remedy at law.   \nPlaintiffs have also shown that the balance of hardships and the public interest weigh in \nfavor of awarding equitable relief. Plaintiffs and member institutions engage in research aimed at \nimproving human health and quality of life in addition to advancing this country’s energy, \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 49 of 52\neconomic, and national security. See, e.g., AAU Decl. ¶ 4 [Doc. No. 40-1]; ACE Decl. ¶ 7 [Doc. \nNo. 40-2]; APLU Decl. ¶ 6 [Doc. No. 40-3]. Whatever the Executive’s views may be about what \nsort of research advances the United States’ economic or national security interests, Defendants \ndo not suggest that diminishing or discontinuing NSF-funded research at IHEs is in the public \ninterest, particularly where the 15% Indirect Cost Rate’s stated goals to “[i]ncreas[e] the \nproportion of federal funds allocated to direct research costs” and allow “NSF and its awardees \nto focus more on scientific progress[.]” NSF Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% \nIndirect Cost Rate, NSF 25-034. And where IHEs—through their NSF-funded research—impact \ntheir local and regional communities via employment and innovation that attracts additional \nspending and investment, halting or disrupting such research will have negative impacts on those \ncommunities. See, e.g., APLU Decl. ¶ 14 [Doc. No. 40-3]; UC Decl. ¶ 15 [Doc. No. 40-7]; \nMinnesota Decl. ¶ 19 [Doc. No. 40-21]; Vanderbilt Decl. ¶ 17 [Doc. No. 40-37].  \nDefendants argue that injunctive relief is not in the public interest where an injunction \nwould force the United States to pay out funds that it may not be able to recover. Mem. ISO \nDefs.’ Mot. 42 [Doc. No. 62]. Defendants cite Department of Education v. California, which \nconcerned a temporary restraining order enjoining the government from terminating grants and \nrequiring it to pay out past-due grant obligations. 604 U.S. __, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025). In \ncontrast, where the court’s determination is a final judgment, not a preliminary injunction, and \nwhere NSF has not terminated or reduced the amount of any existing or continuing grants, \nequitable relief merely prevents NSF from continuing an unlawful policy. “There is generally no \npublic interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.” League of Women Voters of \nUnited States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Relatedly, “[i]t is well established that \nthe Government ‘cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.’” \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 50 of 52\nSee C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 218 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Open Cmties. Alliance v. \nCarson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017)). Accordingly, the public interest and balance \nof hardships favor equitable relief.  \nMoreover, nationwide relief is necessary. Associations may pursue relief that “will inure \nto the benefit of those members of the association actually injured[.]”Int’l Union, United Auto., \nAerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 288 (1986) (quoting \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515 (1975)). Where two of the Organizational Plaintiffs represent \ninstitutions in every state, APLU Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5 [Doc. No. 40-3]; ACE Decl. ¶ 3 [Doc. No. 40-2], \nnationwide relief is necessary to prevent member institutions from suffering harm. Relatedly, \nwhere Plaintiffs and member institutions are dispersed throughout the United States, nationwide \nrelief avoids the “‘chaos and confusion’ of a patchwork of [relief],” which impacts NSF as well \nas IHEs. See NIH, 770 F. Supp. 3d at 327 (quoting Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 19 \nF.4th 1271, 1281–82 (11th Cir. 2021)); id. at 328–29 (explaining a “patchwork of injunctions \nwould cause administrability problems, not only for the institutions relying on consistency to \nprevent the harm discussed above but also for NIH as it attempts to comply with varying \ninjunctions across the country”). \nNonetheless, Plaintiffs have not established that injunctive relief is necessary. “An \ninjunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of \ncourse.” Monsanto, 561 U.S. 139 at 166 (citations omitted). “If a less drastic remedy (such as \npartial or complete . . . vacatur of [the agency’s] decision) [is] sufficient to redress respondents’ \ninjury, no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an injunction [is] warranted.” Id. \n165–66 (internal citations omitted). \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 51 of 52\nHere, vacatur of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate and a judgment declaring it unlawful will \nprovide the Plaintiffs complete relief.8 Where the 15% Indirect Cost Rate causes Plaintiffs to \nsuffer the harms described above, vacating the Policy redresses those injuries. See Action on \nSmoking & Health v. C.A.B., 713 F.2d 795, 797 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“To ‘vacate[]’ . . . means ‘to \nannul; to cancel or rescind; to declare, to make, or to render, void; to defeat; to deprive of force; \nto make of no authority or validity; to set aside.’”) (quoting 91 C.J.S. Vacate (1955)). And \nbecause vacatur voids and rescinds the Policy itself, it provides nationwide relief that redresses \ninjuries suffered by members of the Organizational Plaintiffs. Enjoining Defendants from \nimplementing or enforcing a policy that has been vacated would be duplicative.  \nA declaratory judgment obviates the need to enjoin defendants from reimplementing a \nsubstantively identical policy where a declaratory judgment declares the rights and obligations of \nthe parties and has “the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a); \nUnion de Empleados de Muelles de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Int’l Longshoremen’s Ass’n, 884 F.3d \n48, 58 (1st Cir. 2018) (explaining purpose of declaratory judgment “is to determine the rights \nand obligations of the parties so that they can act in accordance with the law”). Indeed, \n“[b]ecause ‘[a] declaratory judgment is binding on the parties before the court and is res judicata \nin subsequent proceedings as to the matters declared,’ it can be used by a party to later obtain \nfurther relief.” Id. (quoting Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Cardoza-Rodriguez, 133 F.3d 111, 122 n.11 (1st \nCir. 1998)). To the extent Plaintiffs seek to ensure Defendants do not otherwise unlawfully \n \n \n8 To be clear, a permanent injunction would be warranted, if despite foregoing the argument \nhere, Defendants successfully contend on appeal that vacatur is not available under the APA. See \nUnited States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 693 (2023) (“The federal government vigorously disputes \n[that vacatur is available under the APA], arguing that the law does not contemplate this form of \nrelief. The reasons the government offers are plenty and serious enough to warrant careful \nconsideration”) (Gorsuch, J. concurring). \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 52 of 52\nmodify negotiated indirect cost rates “except as permitted by statute and by the regulations of \nOMB,” see Mem. ISO Pls.’ Mot. 40 [Doc. No. 41], an injunction is not required. If Defendants \nmodify negotiated indirect cost rates in a manner contrary to this court’s findings, the \nDeclaratory Judgment and principles of res judicata will ensure that Plaintiffs “will have ample \nopportunity to challenge [such an action], and to seek appropriate preliminary relief.” Monsanto, \n561 U.S. at 164. \nV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and for \nSummary Judgment [Doc. No. 40] is granted in part and denied in part: Plaintiffs’ request for \nSummary Judgment is GRANTED, and their request for a Preliminary Injunction is DENIED as \nmoot. Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 60] is DENIED. \nThe 15% Indirect Cost Rate and Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% Indirect \nCost Rate, NSF 25-034 are vacated and declared invalid, arbitrary and capricious, and contrary \nto law. The court further orders that within 72 hours of entry of this Order, Defendants provide \nwritten notice of the Order to all funding recipients affected by the 15% Indirect Cost Rate and \nthat, further, Defendants notify the court that they have done so promptly thereafter.  \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nJune 20, 2025    /s/Indira Talwani     \n  United States District Judge \n \n52 \n ",
