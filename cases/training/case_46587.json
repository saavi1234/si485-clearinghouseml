On May 8, 2025, Mid-Atlantic Equity Consortium (MAEC) and the NAACP filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and its Secretary. Plaintiffs challenged ED's termination of EAC grants awarded to MAEC and other grant recipients to promote equity in education, effectively ending the EAC program authorized by Congress. Since 1964, the EAC program has provided assistance to schools in meeting their nondiscrimination obligations under the Civil Rights Act. Plaintiffs alleged that ED's termination of EAC grants violated the Fifth Amendment, the First Amendment, the Separation of Powers, and the Administrative Procedure Act, and abrogate obligations under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to District Judge Paul L. Friedman.</p>\r\n<p>On May 22, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). The court granted in part and denied in part a preliminary injunction against defendants on July 30, 2025. The injunction required ED to reinstate MAEC's grant and reimburse MAEC's reasonable expenditures and expenses incurred following the grant's termination. ED was also forbidden from terminating the grant award program at issue.</p>\r\n<p>The injunction finally required a status report from the parties within ten business days of its order; that report is thus due August 13, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

(“MAEC”) and the National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People (“NAACP”), by and through their undersigned counsel, \nbring this action against Defendants and, in support, state the following:   \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  On February 13, 2025, the Defendant United States Department of Education (“ED” \nor the “Department”) terminated the Equity Assistance Center (“EAC”) grant awarded to Plaintiff \nMAEC, and the entire EAC program, abruptly, arbitrarily, and in violation of required procedures \nand Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights on the basis that the grant award (“the EAC grant”) promotes \nequity. The EAC grant funds Plaintiff MAEC’s Center for Education Equity (“CEE”), through \nwhich it provides critical technical assistance to school districts seeking to comply with, or prevent \nviolations of, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972, and other federal civil rights laws.  \n2.  Plaintiff MAEC is one of four grantees awarded by the Department’s EAC Program, \nwhich was established to fund desegregation and anti-discrimination assistance in public schools.1 \nOn the same day and using the same boilerplate language Defendants used to terminate Plaintiff \nMAEC’s grant, the Department terminated EAC grants awarded to the three other grantees. These \nterminations effectively ended the EAC Program, a program authorized by Congress under Title \nIV of the Civil Rights Act.  Since 1964, Congress has appropriated millions of dollars for the EAC \nProgram to provide financial assistance grant awards.  \n3.  As a result of the termination of the EAC program, the members of Plaintiff \nNAACP who attend or are employed by public schools were deprived of the benefits of the \n \n1 See Training and Advisory Services – Equity Assistance Centers: Home, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250421210554/https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-birth-grade-\n12/training-and-advisory-services--equity-assistance-centers (last reviewed Feb. 28, 2025). \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 3 of 59\n \ntechnical assistance and support provided to their school districts by the EAC grantees. The \nDepartment’s elimination of the EAC grantees’ desegregation and anti-discrimination services has \ninflicted outsized harm on Black students, parents, teachers, and school administrators who are \nmembers  of  Plaintiff  NAACP.  Black  students  experience  higher  rates  of  school-based \ndiscrimination and are subject to harsher and more frequent school discipline than their peers, \nharms which the EAC Program and the grantees’ services were addressing prior to Defendants’ \ntermination of the EAC Program and related grants. \n4.  Through this lawsuit, Plaintiff MAEC and Plaintiff NAACP seek to enjoin and set \naside Defendants’ unconstitutional, arbitrary, and lawless termination of the EAC Program and the \nrelated EAC grants.  \n5.  As the Department describes on its website, the EACs design technical assistance \nand training services to support school desegregation, including by working with schools “in the \nareas of harassment, bullying, and prejudice reduction.”2  \n6.  Consistent with this objective, Plaintiff MAEC has been awarded EAC grants for \nmore than three decades.  \n7.  During the current five-year award period, Plaintiff MAEC has responded to \nrequests  for  assistance  to  help  seventeen  school  districts  in  New  York  reduce  racially \ndiscriminatory  discipline  practices,  three  schools  in  Maine  to  decrease  the  racial  academic \nopportunity gap for students in Math and English Language Arts, and countless other local and \nstate educational agencies to improve their compliance with Title IV, Title VI, Title IX, and other \napplicable civil rights laws. Plaintiff MAEC’s work has benefited over one hundred state and local \neducational agencies and hundreds of thousands of students.  \n \n2 Id. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 4 of 59\n \n8.  Despite the measurable benefits of Plaintiff MAEC’s work and the work of the \nother  EAC  grantees,  and  contrary  to  the  Department’s  longstanding  priorities  to  support \ndesegregation and federal nondiscrimination laws, Defendants terminated MAEC’s EAC grant and \nthe grants of each of the EAC grantees on the basis that their activities “promote or take part in \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives.” This termination comes on the heels of \nPresident Donald Trump’s recent executive orders targeting “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” \nincluding an executive order to end all “equity-related” grants and programs. \n9.  The form letter that the Department used to terminate Plaintiff’s EAC grant (“the \nTermination Letter”) provides no definition of diversity, equity, and inclusion, nor information on \nthe types of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs that are permissible or impermissible. The \nTermination  Letter  also  fails  to  reference  Plaintiff  MAEC’s  performance  and  offers  no \nidentification or description of MAEC programs or activities that constitute apparently disfavored \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion, nor of any MAEC programs that are inconsistent with Department \npriorities or otherwise run afoul of the EAC Program or applicable laws. The same is true of the \nform letter used to terminate the other three EAC grants. The Termination Letter denies Plaintiff \nMAEC its statutory and regulatory right to due process prior to termination of the grant, and it \nprovides no opportunity for meaningful appeal or recourse. \n10.  By abruptly and arbitrarily terminating the EAC grants, Defendants have inflicted \nimmediate and irreparable harm on Plaintiff MAEC and the school districts, municipalities, local \neducational  agencies  (“LEAs”),  students,  and  families,  including  the  members  of  Plaintiffs \nNAACP,  Tennessee  NAACP,  and  Fayette  NAACP  (“NAACP  members”),  it  serves.  The \ntermination has forced Plaintiff MAEC, the other EAC grantees, and their partner LEAs to shutter \nor halt ongoing technical assistance projects in multiple school districts that were seeking to \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 5 of 59\n \nprevent and remedy race and sex discrimination in student achievement, discipline, and academic \nplacement—programs that benefited the families, students, teachers, and others who are NAACP \nmembers. \n11.  Without the assistance of the EAC grantees, these school districts lack the resources \nto continue these projects, which are necessary to ensure compliance with federal law and to \nsupport the well-being of students, families, and teachers, including NAACP members. One \nSuperintendent noted that their district “lacks the resources and skills needed to complete the effort” \nPlaintiff  MAEC  was  due  to  conduct  and  that,  without  those  resources,  “[t]he  academic \nachievement and educational outcome discrepancies historically seen within our school district . . . \nwill continue to persist.” Appeal of Grant Award Termination Grant Award S004D220002 (Mar. \n12, 2025) at 19, herein and attached as Exhibit 1.  \n12.  The termination of the EAC grant program on the basis that EAC grants and \ngrantees promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives violates Plaintiff MAEC’s First \nAmendment right to free speech, Plaintiff MAEC’s Fifth Amendment Right to due process, the \nseparation of powers enshrined in the Constitution, and the statutes governing the procedures \nrequired for termination of such grants. The termination also violates Plaintiff NAACP’s right to \nreceive information and Fifth Amendment right to be free of vague prohibitions that infringe upon \nthat right. \n13.  The termination is also a final agency action that exceeds Defendants’ authority \nand contradicts the text of Title VI, Title IX, Part D of the General Education Provisions Act \n(“GEPA”), and other constitutional rights, civil rights laws, and regulations and longstanding \nprecedent interpreting them, and that is not based on reasoned analysis or consideration of \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 6 of 59\n \napplicable reliance interests. Accordingly, it violates the rights of Plaintiffs MAEC and NAACP \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act. \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff  the  Mid-Atlantic  Equity  Consortium,  Inc.  (“MAEC”),  is  a  nonprofit \n501(c)(3) organization. Under the EAC grant, Plaintiff MAEC provided free or low-cost technical \nassistance, planning, and training requested by school districts, municipalities, and states to help \nthem prevent and remediate discrimination, segregation, and the special educational problems \noccasioned by desegregation.  \n15.  Plaintiff NAACP was founded in 1909 and has more than 2,200 local branches, 371 \ncollege chapters, forty-nine Youth Councils, and twenty-three high school chapters across the \ncountry, including Plaintiff Tennessee State Conference of the NAACP (“Tennessee NAACP”) \nand NAACP Fayette-Somerville Branch (“Fayette NAACP”) and their members. The NAACP’s \nprincipal objectives are to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of all \ncitizens; to eliminate racial prejudice; to remove all barriers of racial discrimination through \ndemocratic processes; to seek enactment and enforcement of federal, state, and local laws securing \ncivil rights; and to inform the public of the continued adverse effects of racial discrimination. The \nNAACP’s members include educators and families in every state, including Black students who \nattend PK-12 schools throughout the country and Black educators who teach in PK-12 schools \nthroughout the country. NAACP members’ equal access to their education depends in part upon \nthe development and application of practices that prevent and redress discrimination in classrooms \nand on campuses, including through the technical assistance services made available by the EAC \nProgram. NAACP members have benefited and continue to benefit from the provision of services \nby the EAC program and its grantees, and the elimination of the EAC program and related grants \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 7 of 59\n \nhas denied, and will continue to deny, NAACP members access to and the benefits of trainings, \ninformation, and other technical services that reduce racial and other forms of discrimination in \nschools.  \n16.  Plaintiff Tennessee NAACP is the state conference of the NAACP and shares its \nmissions and goals. Members of the Tennessee NAACP are also members of the national NAACP. \nThe Fayette NAACP is a local unit of Plaintiff NAACP and Plaintiff Tennessee NAACP and \nshares their missions and goals. Members of the Fayette NAACP are also members of Plaintiff \nNAACP and Plaintiff Tennessee NAACP. Plaintiffs Tennessee NAACP and Fayette NAACP have \nmembers who are Black children, parents, and educators across the state who benefit from the \nEAC Program and the services and information provided to their membership by the EAC grantees.  \n17.  Defendant United States Department of Education (the “Department”) is a federal \nagency within the executive branch of the United States government headquartered in Washington, \nD.C. The Department administers and oversees thousands of education-related grants, including \nthe EAC grant, the Equity Assistance Centers Program, and other discretionary grants to remedy \nand prevent discrimination in educational services. \n18.  Defendant Linda M. McMahon is the Secretary of Education and the Department’s \nhighest-ranking official. Defendant McMahon is charged with the supervision and management of \nall decisions and actions of that Department, including its decision to terminate the EAC grant for \nPlaintiff MAEC. She is sued in her official capacity.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 because this action arises under the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 8 of 59\n \n20.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because each Defendant \nis an agency of the United States or an officer or employee of the United States, sued in their \nofficial capacities, and because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim \noccurred in this District. \n21.  The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and injunctive relief \nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 (Declaratory Judgment Act). \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  CONGRESS CREATED THE EQUITY ASSISTANCE CENTER PROGRAM TO \nFUND DESEGREGATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING. \n \n22.  The Equity Assistance Center Program (the “EAC Program”) is “one of [the \nDepartment’s] longest-standing investments in technical assistance” and “ensuring that all students \nhave equitable access to learning opportunities.”3 \n23.  The EAC Program promotes nondiscrimination in education by funding Equity \nAssistance  Centers  to  provide  desegregation  assistance  to  public  schools,  school  districts, \nmunicipalities, and states. See 34 C.F.R. pt. 270. \n24.  Authorized pursuant to Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress created \nthe EAC Program in 1964 as a vehicle to “render technical assistance . . . in the preparation, \nadoption, and implementation of plans for the desegregation of public schools,” 42 U.S.C. § \n2000c–2, and to “arrange, through grants or contracts, . . . institutes for special training designed \nto improve the ability of teachers, supervisors, counselors and other elementary or secondary \nschool personal to deal effectively with special educational problems occasioned by desegregation,” \n42 U.S.C. § 2000c–3.   \n \n3 Training and Advisory Services – Equity Assistance Centers: Home, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., supra note 1. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 9 of 59\n \n25.   As recently as 2022, the Department awarded  5-year EAC grants to nonprofits to \n“operate regional equity assistance centers to provide technical assistance and training, at the \nrequest of school districts and other responsible governmental agencies, on issues related to equity \nin education to ensure that all children, regardless of race, gender, national origin, or religion, have \nequal access to a quality education and the opportunity to develop high academic proficiency in \nreading, math and other core subject areas.”4  \n26.  The EACs “offer technical assistance to school districts . . . who seek to resolve \ncivil rights conflicts” and “more recently [have] provide[d] resources and training in the areas of \nhate crimes, racial prejudice, and bullying.”5  \n27.  According to the Department, the Equity Assistance Centers “play[] a vital role in \nensuring that all students have equitable access to learning opportunities, regardless of their . . . \nrace, sex, national origin, or religion.”6 \n28.  The EAC Program establishes a competitive process for public agencies and private \nnonprofits to apply for grant awards to provide desegregation assistance for school districts and \nLEAs in a given region. 34 C.F.R. §§ 270.1–270.5, 270.7. An entity receiving funds through the \nEAC Program is called an Equity Assistance Center. Id. § 270.1. \n29.  Federal regulations governing the EAC Program define desegregation as “the \nassignment of students to public schools and within those schools without regard” to their race, \nsex,  national  origin,  or  religion,  “including  providing  students  with  a  full  opportunity  for \nparticipation in all educational programs regardless of their” race, sex, national origin, or religion. \nId. § 270.7.  \n \n4 Id. \n5 Id. \n6 Training and Advisory Services – Equity Assistance Centers: Home, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., supra note 1. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 10 of 59\n \n30.  Since 2016, the Department has divided the United States and territories into four \nregions and has awarded EAC grants to four grantees, each of which serves a region. \n31.  In 2022, the Department awarded the EAC grants to four grantees: MAEC to serve \nRegion I, which covers Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Vermont, West \nVirginia, and the Virgin Islands; the Southern Education Foundation to serve Region II, which \ncovers  Alabama,  Arkansas,  Florida,  Georgia,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  North  Carolina,  South \nCarolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia; the Midwest and Plains Equity \nAssistance Center to serve Region III, which covers Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; \nand the Western Educational Equity Assistance Center to serve Region IV, which covers Alaska, \nArizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, \nWashington, Wyoming, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, \nand Guam.7 \n32.  All EACs must provide desegregation assistance in the areas of race, sex, national \norigin, and religion desegregation. Id. §§ 270.4(b), 270.7. \n33.  Desegregation assistance “may include, among other activities, (1) Dissemination \nof  information  regarding  effective  methods  of  coping  with  special  educational  problems \noccasioned by desegregation; (2) Assistance and advice in coping with these problems; and (3) \nTraining designed to improve the ability of teachers, supervisors, counselors, parents, community \n \n7 Training and Advisory Services – Equity Assistance Centers: Contacts, \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250506230015/https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-birth-grade-\n12/training-and-advisory-services--equity-assistance-centers#contacts (last reviewed Feb. 28, 2025) (select a \nstate/area in each color from the map). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 11 of 59\n \nmembers, community organizations, and other elementary or secondary school personnel to deal \neffectively with special educational problems occasioned by desegregation.” Id. § 270.4(c). \n34.  An EAC may provide these services only when requested to do so by a school board \nor other LEA in its assigned region. Id. § 270.3. \n35.  The Department awarded the EAC grant to Plaintiff MAEC and the other grantees \nin 2022 pursuant to the Department’s authority under 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2, which authorizes the \nSecretary of Education to render technical assistance to further desegregation of public schools, \nand the Department’s General Administrative Regulations, including 34 C.F.R. Parts 75, 77, 79, \n81, 82, 84, 86, 97–99 and 2 C.F.R. Parts 180, 485, 3474. \nII. PURSUANT  TO  ITS  EAC  GRANT,  PLAINTIFF  MAEC  AND  THE  OTHER \nGRANTEES OFFERED NEEDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOUSANDS \nOF DISTRICTS NATIONWIDE. \n36.  Plaintiff MAEC has been a part of the EAC Program since MAEC was founded in \n1992.  \n37.  Since 2016, Plaintiff MAEC has provided technical assistance through its Center \nfor Education Equity. With the EAC grant, Plaintiff MAEC provided desegregation assistance \nservices to schools and LEAs in Region 1.  \n38.  Dozens of districts in these states remain subject to school desegregation orders, \nand many of these districts continue to struggle to comply with Federal Civil Rights Law. For \nexample, as of February 2022, Region I had 177 open Title VI investigations at elementary and \nsecondary schools, ranging from racial harassment to denial of benefits to discipline. Of these, \nnearly as many cases (47.5%) were opened in the past two years as were opened in the prior 12-\nyear period (52.5%). Five states (New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland) \nrank in the top 20 states with the largest number of hate incidents against Asian American students \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 12 of 59\n \nbetween March 2020 and December 2021.8 And, per a 2014 study, over 60 districts in Region I \nwere under federal school desegregation orders, including 17 districts in Connecticut, 16 districts \nin New York, nine each in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, eight in Delaware, five in Maryland, and \ntwo each in New Hampshire and Maine.9 \n39.  Plaintiff MAEC was competitively selected for its most recent five-year EAC grant \nunder the Program in 2022, Award No. S004D220002, Project 84.004D. The EAC grant, by its \nterms, awarded Plaintiff MAEC annual funding through September 30, 2027.   \n40.  The grant obligates both the Department and Plaintiff MAEC “to the requirements \nthat apply to the grant.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.236. \n41.  Under the terms of the EAC grant, Plaintiff MAEC was scheduled to receive a total \nof $8,214,498 in annual disbursements to provide technical assistance and training to state \neducational agencies, school districts, and other entities in Region I from October 1, 2022, to \nSeptember 30, 2027. \n42.  Plaintiff MAEC received its most recent Grant Award Notification (“GAN”) on \nAugust 22, 2024. The GAN provided $1,686,452 to Plaintiff MAEC from October 1, 2024, \nthrough September 30, 2025.  \n43.  For more than 30 years (with the exception of 2009-2011, when Plaintiff MAEC \ndid not receive the EAC grant), Plaintiff MAEC has complied with the terms of its EAC grant to \nprovide technical assistance and training to schools and municipalities. \n \n8 MAEC-CEE, Mid Atlantic Equity Consortium Application - S004D22002 4 (Oct. 2022), \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250421211134/https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/2022/10/Region_I_Project_Narrativ\ne-MAEC.pdf \n9 Yue Qiu & Nikole Hannah-Jones, A National Survey of School Desegregation Orders, ProPublica (Dec. 23, 2014), \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250405220525/https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/desegregation-orders. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 13 of 59\n \n44.  Specifically, Plaintiff MAEC delivers technical assistance services designed to \nbuild the capacity of schools and other state and local educational agencies to effectively prevent \nand respond to discrimination, segregation, and the special educational problems occasioned by \ndesegregation, including by improving and sustaining educational agencies’ desegregation and by \nincreasing equitable education opportunities for all students regardless of race, sex, religion, and \nnational origin.10 \n45.  Plaintiff MAEC’s work also helps schools and other entities ensure they are \ncomplying with Title IV and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, and other federal civil rights laws. \n46.  Plaintiff MAEC’s technical assistance to school districts and other eligible entities \nconsists  of  a  wide  range  of  services  to  address  issues  arising  in  schools,  classrooms,  and \ncommunities in the course of efforts to desegregate on the basis of race, national origin, sex, or \nreligion. This may include trainings, webinars, targeted interventions, and strategic planning, and \notherwise assisting schools in fostering positive and safe learning environments that meet all \nstudents’ needs and that are free from bullying and harassment related to race, color, national origin, \nsex, or religion.   \n47.  Plaintiff  MAEC’s  EAC  initiates  its  work  with  states,  districts,  schools,  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  within  Region  I  at  the  request  of  school  boards  and  other \nresponsible governmental agencies. Referrals also come as a result of investigations conducted by \nthe Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) and the Department of Justice. \n48.  Plaintiff  MAEC’s  resources,  training,  and  individualized,  intensive  technical \nassistance have impacted 4,440 school districts and 19,125,434 students. \n \n10 Who We Are, Ctr. for Educ. Equity, https://cee-maec.org/who-we-are/(last visited Apr. 22, 2025). \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 14 of 59\n \n49.  In Fiscal Year 2024 alone, Plaintiff MAEC served 109 state and local educational \nagencies, including schools and other entities. \n50.  During that same Fiscal Year, Plaintiff MAEC engaged in thirty projects to address \ndiscrimination and segregation on the basis of race and national origin, three projects to address \ndiscrimination and segregation on the basis of sex, and one project to reduce discrimination and \nsegregation on the basis of religion. \n51.  For example, Plaintiff MAEC recently worked with school districts in New York \nand Maine to address racial discrimination in school discipline and academic programs. Plaintiff \nMAEC worked with seventeen school districts in New York to improve their school discipline \npractices. As a result of Plaintiff MAEC’s assistance, these schools saw decreases in the racially \ndisproportionate use of school discipline, and the New York State Education Department requested \nthat Plaintiff MAEC provide trainings to prevent discrimination in school discipline trainings \nthroughout the state. Similarly, with Plaintiff MAEC’s assistance, three schools in Portland, Maine \ndecreased the racial academic opportunity gap in Math and English Language Arts by up to ten \npercent. \n52.  Before the Department terminated Plaintiff’s MAEC grant, Plaintiff MAEC was \nscheduled to help six school districts with similar projects, including five districts in Massachusetts \nand one in Pennsylvania. \n53.  In addition to its work under the EAC grant, Plaintiff MAEC provides other \nservices to states, localities, and school districts across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, \nKentucky, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands that similarly advise equal educational opportunity \nand access.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 15 of 59\n \n54.  For example, Plaintiff MAEC operates two statewide family engagement centers: \none for Pennsylvania and Maryland and one in Maine. \n55.  Plaintiff MAEC also previously served as the Maryland Parental Information and \nResource Center from 2011-2016.  \n56.  The Department was aware of all of Plaintiff MAEC’s projects described herein \nthrough meetings and reports. The Department determined whether to issue each continuation \nGAN  and  reviewed  and  approved  MAEC’s  annual  reports,  compliance  with  Government \nPerformance and Results (GPRA) measures, and initiated yearly client surveys, which are also \nprovided to Congress for budget appropriations.      \n57.  The other EAC grantees have similarly impacted millions of students and hundreds \nof districts across the country. The Western Educational Equity Assistance Center has served a \nregion comprising over 12.4 million public school students, the Midwest and Plains Equity \nAssistance Center has served a region of over 11 million students, and the Southern Education \nFoundation has served a region comprising of 17 million students (including 11 million students \nof color and  over a million students who attend school in a district with an active desegregation \norder).11 The Midwest and Plains Equity Assistance Center has, in the past ten years, served over \n186 local education agencies and all thirteen state education agencies in its region.12 \nIII.

Plaintiff NAACP has over 97,664 members. NAACP membership includes Black \neducators in nearly every state, 7,803 active college members in 371 college chapters in 43 states, \n295 active high school members in 23 high school chapters in 23 states, and 12,611 active Youth \nCouncil members in 567 Youth Council chapters in 49 states. In addition, members in each state \nchapter have school-aged children who attend PK-12 schools. \n59.  Plaintiff NAACP has members across the country who attend K-12 public schools \nthat benefit from, and in many instances, rely on, technical assistance and support provided by \nEAC grantees. For example, NAACP members and their children attend schools in Fayette County \nPublic Schools (“FCPS”) in Tennessee, a school district that requested and received technical \nassistance and other EAC support from the southern region EAC grantee, Southern Education \nFoundation (“SEF”). FCPS is currently subject to a federal court’s school desegregation order, \nwhich requires FCPS to contract with the EAC grantee for services. In connection with FCPS’ \nefforts to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination against Black students and educators, including \nNAACP members, SEF provided teacher recruitment, hiring, and retention training to FCPS and \ntechnical assistance designed to create a more supportive environment for Black teachers and \nprepare all teachers to teach Black students in an engaging and effective way.  \n60.  For example, SEF provided tailored instructional practices and strategies to FCPS, \nconsulting on district goals and challenges to maximize FCPS’ ability to “grow their own” \nculturally responsive teachers, including NAACP educator members. SEF also offered FCPS a \nvariety of professional development resources, including workshops, consultation services, and \nresources on retaining teachers and fostering a supportive environment for all teachers, including \nFayette NAACP educator members, and students, including Fayette NAACP student members.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 17 of 59\n \n61.  Black students, including the children of NAACP members and student members \nof NAACP Youth Councils, experience higher rates of school-based discrimination than their \npeers.  Services  provided  by  the  EACs,  including  Plaintiff  MAEC,  to  address  school-based \ndiscrimination directly benefit NAACP members and other Black students in state and local \neducational agencies served by the EACs. \n62.  Black students are, for example, at greater risk of experiencing racial discrimination \nthan their peers. As a result, they must expend cognitive energy processing discrimination and are \nless able to spend that energy on learning and development.13 \n63.  Indeed,  more  than  a  fifth  of  Black  post-secondary  students  frequently  or \noccasionally feel discriminated against.14 61% of those students have considered dropping out of \nschool as a result.15 During Fiscal Year 2024, 19% (4,307) of the nearly 23,000 complaints that \nED’s Office for Civil Rights received alleged discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national \norigin.16 \n64.  Racially  discriminatory  acts,  including  school-based  discrimination,  are \n“detrimental  to  students’  motivation,  engagement,  development,  learning,  performance,  and \npsychological well-being.”17 \n \n13 Sellers et al., Racial Identity Matters: The Relationship between Racial Discrimination and Psychological \nFunctioning in African American Adolescents, 16 J.

Defendants have also recognized that students of color, particularly Black students \nincluding NAACP members, are subject to harsher and more frequent school discipline.18 Studies \nshow that the racially discriminatory administration of discipline adversely affects students’ \nacademic performance, attendance, and behavior; may contribute to lower enrollment in higher \neducation; and may push students into the criminal justice system.19 \n66.  Schools often fail to appropriately respond to school-based discrimination and its \nimpacts on NAACP members and other students. But technical assistance, including the provision \nof training and revisions to policies, can help K-12 schools better respond to school-based \ndiscrimination and can ensure equal educational opportunities for NAACP members and other \nBlack students and Black educators. \n67.  For example, Plaintiff MAEC created a technical assistance tool, A Data Inquiry \nGuide for Identifying and Addressing Equity Gaps, to provide services to schools to increase \nacademic achievement and close racial opportunity gaps. Using the Inquiry Guide, Plaintiff MAEC \nwas able to reduce the racial opportunity gaps across a cohort of three public schools in Maine, \n \n18 Joint “Dear Colleague” Letter from the U.S. Dep’t of Educ. & U.S. Dep’t of Just.

Similarly, changes to school discipline policies and programs, including those \nfacilitated by EAC technical assistance, equalize education for all students and mitigate harms to \nBlack students. For example, research shows that Black students are less likely to be excluded and \nmore likely to benefit from their educational environment when their schools adopt restorative \njustice practices, begin regularly analyzing and responding to racial disparities in discipline, and \ntake other steps to reduce racial discrimination in discipline.20 \n69.  In another example of how the targeted support and technical services provided by \nEAC grantees yielded tangible and transformative results for students, including NAACP student \nmembers, SEF played a vital role in assisting a district with a comprehensive revision of its \ndiscipline policies and framework designed to eliminate unfair disciplinary practices and reduce \nexcessive suspensions. As a direct result of this targeted consulting, the district experienced a \ndramatic reduction in disciplinary hearings, dropping from 35 per year to just 3.21   \n70.  Educators, including NAACP members, regularly receive and rely on technical \nassistance from Plaintiff MAEC and other EACs to implement these changes, properly respond to \nschool-based discrimination, and otherwise facilitate equal education access for all students. \n71.  Educators, including NAACP members, benefit from the ability to openly discuss \nand  learn  from  trainings  and  instructional  materials  that  address  problems  occasioned  by \ndesegregation and promote equity and equal educational access, including materials and programs \n \n20 Anne Gregory & Katherine Evans, The Starts and Stumbles of Restorative Justice in Education: Where Do We Go \nfrom Here?, Nat’l Educ. Pol’y Ctr. 3 (2020), \nhttps://nepc.colorado.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Revised%20PB%20Gregory 0.pdf \n[https://perma.cc/C6LEQBS6] (discussing, among other benefits, that schools that adopt these practices saw a drop \nin suspension rates). \n21 Motion at Ex. 1, p. 5, S.

The ability to openly discuss and learn from \nthese ideas creates a more supportive environment for educators, including Plaintiff NAACP \nmembers and other Black educators, and helps those educators create a more supportive learning \nenvironment for students. \nIV. PRESIDENT  TRUMP  TARGETS  PROGRAMS  THAT  HE  ASSERTS  PROMOTE \nDIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION. \n \n72.  In the opening days of the new administration, President Donald Trump issued a \nseries of executive orders broadly seeking to end all efforts to advance initiatives that he identifies \nas relating to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.   \n73.  The new administration’s broad efforts to end all purported diversity, equity, \ninclusion, and accessibility initiatives extended to the Department’s grants. \n74.  On Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order \nNo. 14151, titled “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.” \n90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025).  \n75.  Executive  Order  No.  14151  asserts  that  diversity,  equity,  inclusion,  and \naccessibility programs are “illegal and immoral discrimination programs.” Id. To impose the \nAdministration’s viewpoint, the Order requires each federal agency head to “terminate, to the \nmaximum extent allowed by law, all . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts” within 60 days. Id.  \n76.  The next day, on January 21, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order No. \n14173, titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,” 90 Fed. \nReg. 8633 (Jan. 31, 2025). \n77.  As expressed in its title, this executive order characterizes diversity, equity, and \ninclusion  efforts  as  contrary  to  the  Administration’s  preferred  viewpoint,  “merit-based \nopportunity.”   \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 21 of 59\n \n78.  Executive Order No. 14173 requires the Director of Office of Management and \nBudget (“OMB”), with the assistance of the Attorney General, to “[e]xcise references to DEI and \nDEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, \ngrants, and financial assistance procedures” and to “[t]erminate all ‘diversity,’ ‘equity,’ ‘equitable \ndecision-making,’ ‘equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,’ ‘advancing equity,’ \nand like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate.” Id. at 8634.  \n79.  Executive Order No. 14173 also instructs federal agencies to include in every \ncontract or grant award terms requiring each contractual counterparty or grant recipient “to certify \nthat it does not operate any programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion that violate any \napplicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.” Id.  \n80.  Executive Orders Nos. 14151 and 14173 (“the Executive Orders”) demonstrate the \nAdministration’s intent to target and censor speech, programs, and activities that Defendants view \nas promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, these Executive Orders provide no \ndefinitions of their key terms, such as “diversity,” “equity, and “inclusion,” and no method or \ninformation to identify “illegal DEI” or which grants are “equity-related.” \n81.  The Executive Orders provide no guidance concerning the manner in which a grant, \npolicy, program, statement, action, activity, or contract will be deemed an unlawful diversity, \nequity, or inclusion initiative, as “promoting DEI,” as “illegal DEI,” or as “illegal discrimination \nor preferences.” \n82.  Consistent with these Executive Orders, Defendants have targeted “equity-related \ngrants” for termination on the basis that they promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, including \nPlaintiff MAEC’s use of its EAC grant to conduct long-running desegregation and technical \nassistance programs in schools throughout Region I.  \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 22 of 59\n \n83.  As explained below, Defendants have relied on the arbitrary and vague terms used \nin the Executive Orders to terminate the federal grants of those grantees, like Plaintiff MAEC, that \nDefendants perceive as engaging in speech, training, advocacy, or mission-driven services that \nDefendants disfavor.  \nV.  THE  DEPARTMENT  TERMINATES  THE  EAC  GRANTS,  INCLUDING \nPLAINTIFF MAEC’S GRANT.   \n \n84.  On February 5, 2025, the Department Acting Secretary of Education issued an \ninternal directive requiring Department personnel to review “issued grants” to “ensur[e] that \nDepartment grants do not fund discriminatory practices” that are “contrary to law or to the \nDepartment’s policy objectives.” Pls’ Mem. Supp. TRO, Ex. 20 (Directive on Department Grant \nPriorities), California v. Dep’t of Educ., No. 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 1099496 (D. Mass. \nMar. 6, 2025), ECF No. 8-20. The directive expressly extends to “practices . . .  in the form of \n[diversity, equity, and inclusion].” App. To Application to Vacate Order at 12a (App.), U.S. Dep’t \nof Educ. v. California, No. 24A910 (Mar. 26, 2025).  \n85.  The internal directive does not define key terms such as “diversity, equity, and \ninclusion,” nor does it explain how the Department will determine that a grantee is engaged in \n“diversity, equity, and inclusion” practices. Id.    \n86.  Eight days later, on February 13, 2025, the Department sent Plaintiff MAEC a \nboilerplate Termination Letter announcing the immediate termination of the EAC grant for \nPlaintiff MAEC, Federal Award No. S004D22002, and the immediate “suspension” of Plaintiff \nMAEC’s access to its EAC grant funds. Exhibit 1 at 14.  \n87.  On the same day, the Department sent each of the other three EAC grant recipients \nand over a hundred other program grantees boilerplate letters announcing the termination of their \ngrant awards. The letters were identical to the Termination Letter received by Plaintiff MAEC, \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 23 of 59\n \nsave for differences in the addressees, termination dates, and grant-award numbers. None of the \nletters included findings specific to individual recipients’ actual conduct.  \n88.  The Termination Letter sets forth the Department’s justification for the grant \ntermination in a single paragraph, which states as follows:  \nThe grant specified above provides funding for programs that promote or take part in DEI \ninitiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic; that violate either the letter \nor purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict with the Department’s policy of \nprioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, \nor duplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States. The \ngrant is therefore inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities. See 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.253. Therefore, pursuant to, among other \nauthorities, 2 C.F.R. § 200.339-43, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, and the termination provisions in \nyour grant award, the Department hereby terminates grant No. [grant award number] in its \nentirety effective [date of letter]. \nExhibit 1 at 14. \n \n89.  The Termination Letter further states that “[i]t is a priority of the Department to \neliminate discrimination in all forms of education throughout the United States,” and that “this \npriority includes ensuring that the Department’s grants do not support programs or organizations \nthat promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives or any other \ninitiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or \nanother protected characteristic.” See id. \n90.  This purported “priority” upon which Defendants base their termination of the EAC \nProgram and Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant was not lawfully adopted and cannot be lawfully \nimposed on Plaintiff MAEC mid-budget year. See infra Section IX. \n91.  The Termination Letter characterizes Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant as “promot[ing] \nor tak[ing] part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic; that violate either the \nletter or  purpose of  Federal  civil rights  law;  that  conflict with  the Department’s policy of \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 24 of 59\n \nprioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education . . . ; or that otherwise fail to serve the best \ninterests of the United States.” See Exhibit 1 at 14. \n92.  The  Termination  Letter  does  not  define  the  words  “diversity,”  “equity,”  or \n“inclusion.” \n93.  The Termination Letter does not define the phrases “diversity, equity, and inclusion \ninitiatives” or “[i]llegal DEI policies and practices.” \n94.  On the same day that Plaintiff MAEC and the other EAC grantees received the \nTermination Letter, the Department also sent Plaintiff MAEC an updated GAN listing the budget \nperiod as October 1, 2024, through February 13, 2025, and stating that the grant was terminated \nbecause it was deemed “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities.” See \nid. \n95.  On the same day that Plaintiff MAEC and the other EAC grantees received the \nTermination Letter and the updated GAN, the Department issued a press release (the “February 13 \nPress Release”) announcing that it had cancelled over $350 million in contracts and grants, \nincluding $33 million in grants to MAEC and the other three EACs.22  \n96.  The February 13 Press Release suggests that the grant termination was effectuated \npursuant to Executive Order 14151, requiring the Department to terminate “equity-related” grants \nor contracts. The press release states that Plaintiff and other Equity Assistance Centers “support \ndivisive training in DEI, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity for state and local education \nagencies as well as school boards.” \n \n22 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., U.S. Department of Education Cancels Additional $350 Million in Woke \nSpending: Contracts and grants terminated at several Regional Educational Laboratories and Equity Assistance \nCenters (Feb. 13, 2025), https://web.archive.org/web/20250422213426/https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-\nrelease/us-department-of-education-cancels-additional-350-million-woke-spending. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 25 of 59\n \n97.  The February 13 Press Release provides no basis or explanation for its assertion \nthat Plaintiff MAEC or any other Equity Assistance Centers “support divisive training in DEI, \nCritical Race Theory, and gender identity for state and local education agencies as well as school \nboards.” \n98.   Nor does the February 13 Press Release define “divisive training,” “DEI,” “Critical \nRace Theory,” and “gender identity.” \n99.  The Termination Letter does not describe how Plaintiff MAEC or any of the \nprograms and initiatives that Plaintiff MAEC operates are contrary to federal law.  \n100.  The Termination Letter includes a general list of potential grounds for cancellation, \nbut it does not specify any basis for the termination of Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant. See Exhibit \n1 at 14. \n101.  The Termination Letter provides no factual basis for its conclusion that Plaintiff \nMAEC had engaged in any of the potential grounds for cancellation. \n102.  Similarly, the termination letters issued to the Southern Education Foundation, the \nMidwest and Plains Equity Assistance Center, and the Western Educational Equity Assistance \nCenter do not describe how those EACs or their activities are contrary to federal law and do not \nprovide a factual or legal basis for the termination of their grants. \n103.  Plaintiff MAEC was in the middle of the FY2024 budget period when it received \nthe Termination Letter. The applicable statutes and regulations required the Department to comply \nwith robust due process procedures as a condition precedent for terminating a grant award in the \nmid-budget period, including an investigation, notice of finding,  remediation, and administrative \nlaw adjudication. In the Termination Letter, the Department cited some of these authorities for the \ntermination. However, it did not comply with the required due process procedures.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 26 of 59\n \n104.  The Termination Letter briefly mentions an appeal process and imposes a thirty-\nday timeline to challenge the termination. See id. at 15. \n105.  The Termination Letter does not describe any procedures for the Department to \nprocess appeals, objections, or challenges, and it deviates from required statutory and regulatory \ntermination procedures. See infra Sections VIII, IX.   \n106.  The Termination Letter does not state whether any interim relief is possible or \navailable.   \n107.  The Termination Letter does not set forth a deadline by which the Department is \nobligated to make a determination regarding an appeal.     \n108.  Prior to the Termination Letter, the Department did not send Plaintiff MAEC any \npretermination notice or provide Plaintiff MAEC any opportunity to be heard.   \n109.  Prior to the Termination Letter, the Department did not offer Plaintiff MAEC an \nopportunity to cure any alleged noncompliance.    \n110.  Defendants did not consider the reliance interests of Plaintiff MAEC and the school \ndistricts  Plaintiff  MAEC  serves  before  terminating  the  EAC  grant.  For  example,  the  grant \ntermination forced Plaintiff MAEC to terminate the technical assistance and training projects \nrequested by six school districts. The grant termination also forced Plaintiff MAEC to lay off four \nstaff members, lose another, and reduce the workload and compensation of remaining staff. \n111.  Similarly,  as  a  result  of  the  Termination  Letters,  the  other  EAC  grantees \nimmediately ceased their EAC operations. The Midwest and Plains Equity Assistance Center \nimmediately shuttered all operations and no longer employs any staff. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 27 of 59\n \n112.  On March 12, 2025, Plaintiff MAEC submitted a timely appeal to the Acting \nAssistant Secretary for the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, objecting to the \nTermination Letter. See generally Exhibit 1.   \n113.  As of the date of filing of this Complaint, the Department has not responded to \nPlaintiff MAEC’s agency appeal. \n114.  The Southern Education Foundation similarly submitted a timely appeal. As of the \ndate of filing of this Complaint, the Department has not responded to that appeal.    \nVI. THE DEPARTMENT’S TERMINATION OF PLAINTIFF MAEC’S GRANT \nRELIES ON IMPROPERLY PROMULGATED DEPARTMENTAL PRIORITIES. \n \n115.   The Termination Letter does not define or describe the “priorities” to which it \nrefers and upon which it bases its termination of Plaintiff MAEC’s grant, including how those \npriorities were adopted.  \n116.  With limited exceptions not applicable here, the Department is required to establish \nits agency priorities, including those governing grant programs, through notice-and-comment \nrulemaking. 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2); 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d); see also Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. \nEduc. v. McMahon, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025).  \n117.  The Department’s Priorities must be published in the Federal Register, and the \npublished Priorities must be used to define the more specific priorities for an award competition \nunless certain exceptions, not relevant here, apply. 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2). Defendants must \npublish these priorities in the Notice Inviting Applications for the grant in the Federal Register. 34 \nC.F.R. § 75.105(b)(l). \n118.  The Department has  published,  after  notice-and-comment rulemaking, several \ndifferent sets of priorities that apply to Plaintiff MAEC’s grant. Pursuant to the required notice-\n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 28 of 59\n \nand-comment rulemaking process, the Department published its Notice of Final Priority and \nRequirement for EACs in the Federal Register on July 18, 2016.  \n119.  The Department’s July 18, 2016 final priority requires a successful grant applicant \nto have “a track record of success or demonstrated expertise in developing or providing technical \nassistance to increase socioeconomic diversity in schools or school districts as a means to further \ndesegregation by race, sex, national origin, and religion.” 81 Fed. Reg. 46,817–19 (to be codified \nat 34 C.F.R. ch. II).  \n120.  Following notice-and-comment rulemaking, the Department priorities for all of its \ndiscretionary grant programs were published on March 9, 2020, Administrative Priorities for \nDiscretionary Grant Programs, 85 Fed. Reg. 13,640–42, and were supplemented on December 10, \n2021, 86 Fed. Reg. 70,612–40 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 75). Among other things, the \nsupplemental priorities include “promoting equity in student access to educational resources and \nopportunities,” “supporting a diverse educator workforce,” and “meeting student social, emotional, \nand academic needs,” including by “addressing disparities in school discipline policy.” 86 Fed. \nReg. 70,636–38. \n121.   On February 15, 2022, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, the Department \npublished a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY2022 EAC competition, inviting applicants to \napply for the grant funds. 87 Fed. Reg. 8564, 8564–70. \n122.  In  addition  to  the  Departmental  priorities  cited  above,  the  FY2022  EAC \ncompetition also set as a priority: “Promoting Equity Through Diverse Partnerships.”  Id. at 8566. \n123.  Since establishing the above-described priorities, the Department has not conducted \nany  notice-and-comment  rulemaking  to  change  its  priorities  for  discretionary  grantmaking \nprograms.  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 29 of 59\n \n124.  The above-described published priorities remain the Department’s published and \nlawful priorities. \n125.  The EAC Program and the terms of Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant remain consistent \nwith the Department’s published priorities. \n126.  The EAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s conduct as an EAC grantee is consistent \nwith the Department’s published priorities. \n127.  For example, Plaintiff MAEC planned activities consistent with the priority stated \nin the 2022 Notice Inviting Applications, which seeks applicants that promote educational equity \nby partnering with, among others, minority-serving institutions, 87 Fed. Reg. at 8566. MAEC had \nplanned to partner with Capital Community College, a minority-serving institution, to support their \ndual enrollment programs with K-12 public schools during the 2024-25 grant year; however, this \npartnership was stopped because Defendants terminated the EAC grant. \n128.  Also in furtherance of the Priorities, MAEC partnered with other grantees and \ncontractors to train state and local education agency staff to effectively teach and assess English \nLearners and supported Burlington School District in tracking and addressing incidents of sex-\nbased harassment and bullying. \n129.  In addition, and consistent with the Department’s established Priorities, Plaintiff \nMAEC supports school districts within New York to promote socioeconomic diversity as a way \nto further desegregation, and has published resources that all school districts can use. \n130.  Defendants have no authority to impose a new priority on Plaintiff MAEC in the \nmiddle of its budget year. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 30 of 59\n \n131.  Defendants  have  no  authority  to  assert  that  any  “priorities,”  other  than  the \nDepartment’s properly established Priorities, including a desire to terminate equity-related grants \nand programs, may be used to evaluate prospective grantees.  \n132.  Defendants  have  no  authority  to  assert  that  any  “priorities”  other  than  the \nDepartment’s properly established Priorities, including a desire to terminate equity-related grants \nand programs, may be used to evaluate the performance of current grantees.   \nVII.  PLAINTIFF  MAEC  AND  OTHER  EQUITY  ASSISTANCE  CENTERS’ \nPROVISION  OF  TECHNICAL  ASSISTANCE  TO  PREVENT  AND  REMEDY \nDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN, SEX, AND \nRELIGION  COMPLIES  WITH  APPLICABLE  FEDERAL  LAWS  AND \nREGULATIONS. \n133.  The  Department’s  Termination  Letter  incorrectly  claims  that  EAC  activities, \nincluding Plaintiff MAEC’s programs, “unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, national origin or another protected characteristic” and “violate either the letter or \npurpose of Federal civil rights law.”  \n134.  Plaintiff MAEC and other EACs’ technical assistance work is consistent with \nfederal civil rights laws, including Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, \ncolor, and national origin, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the \nbasis of sex. 20 U.S.C. § 1681. \n135.  The EAC grant program and its grantees, like Plaintiff MAEC, provide technical \nassistance, trainings and toolkits, and targeted interventions to help schools comply with the \nmandates of Title VI and Title IX. In doing so, the EAC grant program, including Plaintiff \nMAEC’s work, is intended to prevent or reduce instances of discrimination on the basis of race, \ncolor, religion, sex, and national origin within Region I. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 31 of 59\n \n136.  For example, Plaintiff MAEC provides technical assistance designed to reduce the \nrates of school-based race and sex discrimination. In recent years, Region I has seen an increase \nin Title VI investigations in elementary schools, increasing segregation along racial lines, and high \nrates of  sexual  harassment. Plaintiff MAEC also provides technical assistance and targeted \ninterventions to reduce racial discrimination in discipline. During the 2018-19 grant year, Plaintiff \nMAEC provided targeted assistance to New York school districts to reduce racial discrimination \nin exclusionary discipline. It piloted a toolkit, Getting Started with Restorative Practices in \nSchools: A Toolkit for Administrators, which it subsequently made available to schools throughout \nRegion I to help them comply with Title VI. Because of Plaintiff MAEC’s technical assistance, \none of the New York school districts reduced their use of suspensions within the first year. Plaintiff \nMAEC continued assisting New York schools to reduce racial discrimination in exclusionary \ndiscipline over multiple grant years.   \n137.  In addition, Plaintiff MAEC provides technical assistance to prevent and reduce \nracial discrimination that impacts academic achievement. For example, during the 2018-19 grant \nyear, Plaintiff MAEC created a tool, A Data Inquiry Guide for Identifying and Addressing Equity \nGaps (hereinafter “Inquiry Guide”).23 After Plaintiff MAEC partnered with a Maine school district \nto pilot the Inquiry Guide in three schools, all schools reported a decrease in racial opportunity \ngaps in English Language Arts and Math. Plaintiff MAEC proposed, and the Department agreed, \nthat Plaintiff MAEC would continue this work and implement the Inquiry Guide throughout the \nschool district. \n138.  Plaintiff MAEC has also sought to address increases in the race- and sex-based \nharassment that have resulted in hostile environments in violation of Title VI and IX. As part of \n \n23 See Susan Villani et al., A Data Inquiry Guide: for Exploring Equity Issues and Solutions, MAEC (Mar. 2021), \nhttps://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED627711.pdf.  \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 32 of 59\n \ntheir 2022 grant application, Plaintiff MAEC proposed, and the Department agreed, that Plaintiff \nMAEC would provide a wide range of services, including a webinar series on racism and \nxenophobia to address anti-Asian American discrimination and intensive services to address peer-\nto-peer sex-based harassment and bullying.  \n139.  And in November 2024, at the request of an Intermediate Unit, representing several \nschool  districts  in  Pennsylvania,  Plaintiff  MAEC  developed  and  presented  a  professional \nworkshop on best practices to support LGBTQIA+ students in school.  \n140.  Based  on  these  and  similar  successful  projects,  the  Department  has  renewed \nPlaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant every year since 2016.  \n141.  The  goals  and  actions  of  the  EAC  grantees,  including  Plaintiff  MAEC,  are \nconsistent with the Department’s longstanding values, guidance, and past resolution agreements \npertaining  to  Title  VI  and  Title  IX.  For  example,  in  2020,  during  President  Trump’s  first \nadministration,  then-Secretary  of  Education  Betsy  DeVos  told  the  Department’s  staff  in  a \nmemorandum  that  “[d]iversity  and  inclusion  are  the  cornerstones  of  high  organizational \nperformance.”  The Secretary also opined that “embracing diversity and inclusion are key elements \nfor success” for “building strong teams.”24  \n142.  The  Department  has  entered  into  resolution  agreements  that  permitted,  and \nsometimes required, schools to adopt race-neutral measures to address racial discrimination.25 The \nDepartment has required schools to collect and maintain data on racial disparities in discipline, has \nordered schools to use that data to identify and remedy racial disparities in the administration of \n \n24 Erica L.

Moreover, the Department has previously issued guidance stating that diversity, \nequity, and inclusion trainings, training on the impact of racism, cultural competency trainings, \nand other nondiscrimination trainings “in most circumstances are consistent with Title VI” and \nhave been implemented to redress discrimination.27  \n144.  The Department has also issued guidance directing that schools may need to \nprovide training to students to prevent the recurrence of sexual harassment that creates a hostile \nenvironment.28  \n145.  And in response to findings that school districts did not respond appropriately to \nharassment and discrimination in violation of Title VI and Title IX, the Department has routinely \n \n26 See, e.g., Victor Valley Union High School District Resolution Agreement, OCR Case No. 09-14-5003 (Aug. 15, \n2022)), https://web.archive.org/web/20250422220344/https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/in\nvestigations/more/09145003-b.pdf; Davis School District, Farmington, UT Agreement/Findings (Oct. 20, 2021) \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250422221230/https://www.justice.gov/d9/case-\ndocuments/attachments/2021/10/21/doj_dsd_settlement_agreement_508.pdf; East Side Union High School District \nResolution Agreement, OCR Case No. 09-14-1242 (Dec. 13, 2017), \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250403234526/https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-\nagreements/09141242-b.pdf; Bushnell-Prairie City Community Unit School District Resolution Agreement, OCR \nCase No. 05-16-7034 (May 4, 2017) ), \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250423013538/https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-\nagreements/05167034-b.pdf. \n27 See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for C.

R., Know Your Rights: Title IX Requires Your School to Address Sexual \nViolence* 2 (Apr. 2014, modified Oct. 2020), \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250423014456/https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/know-\nrights-201404-title-ix.pdf. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 34 of 59\n \nentered into resolution agreements requiring those districts to offer training about harassment on \nthe basis of race and/or sex.29 \n146.  The Department’s longstanding interpretation of Title VI and Title IX is consistent \nwith Congress’s recognition of the importance of diversity as a means of furthering educational \nequity and its authorization of programs to foster diversity in public education. For example, \nCongress has specifically recognized that it is in “the best interest[] of the United States” to “foster \nmeaningful interaction among students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds.” 20 U.S.C. §§ \n7231(a)(4)(A), (b), b(3) (providing federal funds for the Magnet School Assistance Program’s \n“development,  design,  and  expansion  of  innovative  educational  methods  and  practices  that \npromote diversity”). \n147.  Plaintiff  MAEC  and  the  other  EACs’  technical  assistance  work  is  likewise \nconsistent with the Department’s overriding “mission to ensure equal access to education,” 20 \nU.S.C. § 1228a(a), and its requirement that grant recipients take steps “to ensure equitable access \nto, and equitable participation in, the project or activity to be conducted with such assistance, by \naddressing the special needs of students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries in order to \novercome barriers to equitable participation, including barriers based on gender, race, color, \nnational origin, disability, and age,” id. § 1228a(b).  \n \n29 See, e.g., Fremont Unified School District Resolution Agreement, OCR Case No. 09-13-5001 (Jan. 12, 2017), \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250423023136/https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-\nagreements/09135001-b.pdf (requiring mandatory training for all staff on race-based harassment and processing, \ninvestigating, and/or resolving complaints of discrimination); Berkeley County Schools, WV Resolution Agreement, \nOCR Case No. 03-16-1179 (Oct. 11, 2018) 3–4, \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250423024359/https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-\nagreements/03161179-b.pdf (requiring training for all staff on preventing, recognizing, and appropriately responding \nto complaints of sex discrimination, including documentation of staff who did not attend the training). \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 35 of 59\n \n148.  Plaintiff MAEC and the other EACs’ technical assistance work is also consistent \nwith the Department’s current priorities established through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  See \nsupra pp. 26–27.  \n149.  Plaintiff MAEC has come to rely on the Department’s longstanding interpretations \nof Title VI and Title IX.  \n150.  The Department’s statements in the Termination Letter, including its new purported \npriorities, see supra p. 22, contradict decades of the Department’s prior guidance, resolution \nagreements, and past positions. \n151.  The Department has provided no explanation of how and why it has changed its \nposition on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs, even though many of these \nprograms are authorized by statute and regulation. When promulgating and acting pursuant to a \nrule with the force of law, the Department must undertake notice and comment and respond to the \npublic’s comments and recommendations.  \n152.  Neither Plaintiff MAEC nor any other grant recipient was given any prior notice of \nor opportunity to comment on, or adjust its work in response to, the Department’s purported new \npriorities or position. \n153.  The Termination Letter improperly enforces the Department’s new priorities or \nposition, which failed to follow the required notice and comment processes. 5 U.S.C. § 553 (b), \n(c); Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 95–96 (2015).  \n154.  When changing positions, agencies must “provide a reasoned explanation for the \nchange,” “display awareness that [they are] changing position,” and consider “serious reliance \ninterests.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221–22 (2016) (quoting F.C.C. v. \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 36 of 59\n \nFox Television Stations, Inc., 556 US 502, 515 (2009)). The Department failed to undertake this \nprocess at all. \n155.  The Department’s termination of Plaintiff MAEC and the other EACs’ grants, \neffectively terminating the EAC program, is not only inconsistent with Title VI and Title IX, but \nit also undermines Title VI, Title IX, and other federal civil rights laws by removing resources that \nsupport Region I schools’ compliance with those laws. \nVIII.  THE DEPARTMENT’S TERMINATION OF PLAINTIFF MAEC’S EAC GRANT \nVIOLATES TITLE VI, GEPA, AND OTHER REQUIRED TERMINATION \nPROCEDURES. \n \n156.  The Department’s authority to withhold grant funds or terminate grants in the \nmiddle of the budget period is governed by Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1, the regulations \nimplementing Title VI, 34 C.F.R. § 100.8, GEPA, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1234–1234i, and OMB’s Uniform \nGuidance, 2 C.F.R. part 200, as adopted by the Department, 2 C.F.R. § 3474.1(a). These statutes \nand regulations provide the substantive and procedural standards for terminating a grant mid-\nbudget period. \n157.  The Termination Letter purports to terminate Plaintiff MAEC’s grant based on \nalleged violations of federal civil rights laws, which presumably include Title VI.  \n158.  Title  VI  delineates  specific  procedures  that  an  agency  must  follow  to \n“terminat[e] . . . or refus[e] to grant or to continue assistance” based upon alleged violations of \nTitle VI. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n159.  First, the agency must “advise[] the appropriate person or persons of the failure to \ncomply with the requirement [of Title VI]” and “determine[] that compliance cannot be secured \nby voluntary means.” Id. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 37 of 59\n \n160.  The agency must provide “an opportunity for a hearing,” and there must be “an \nexpress finding on the record . . . of a failure to comply with” a requirement of Title VI. Id.  \n161.  The agency must file “a written report of the circumstances and the grounds for” \ntermination with the appropriate House and Senate Committees. Id. “No action shall become \neffective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.” Id. \n162.  The  Department’s  regulations  implementing  Title  VI  reiterate  the  procedural \nrequirements an agency must follow before terminating a grant. 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c).  \n163.  The Title VI regulations make clear that “ [n]o action to effect compliance by any \nother means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Department official has \ndetermined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person \nhas been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and \n(3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person.” \nId. § 100.8(d).  \n164.  The Title VI regulations apply to EAC grants. 34 C.F.R. pt. 100, App. A, pt. 1(18).  \n165.  Defendants failed to advise Plaintiff MAEC of its alleged noncompliance with Title \nVI before terminating its EAC grant or make any determination that compliance could not be \nsecured through voluntary means.  \n166.  Defendants failed to provide Plaintiff MAEC with an opportunity for a hearing.  \n167.  Defendants failed to secure an express finding on the record that Plaintiff MAEC \ndid not comply with a requirement of Title VI.  \n168.  Defendants failed to submit a written report to the House or Senate thirty days \nbefore freezing Plaintiff MAEC’s funds.  \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 38 of 59\n \n169.  In  addition  to  Title  VI,  GEPA  establishes  the  substantive  standard  and  the \nprocedures that the Department must follow before withholding grant funds or terminating a grant \nduring the budget period.  \n170.  GEPA applies to EAC grants because they are an “applicable program” for which \nthe Secretary or the Department has administrative responsibility as provided by law. 20 U.S.C. § \n1234i; accord 34 C.F.R. § 270.6; 34 C.F.R. pt. 81.  \n171.  GEPA allows the Department to withhold funds from a grantee only if the grantee \n“is failing to comply substantially with any requirement of law applicable to such funds.” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1234c(a). \n172.  Before withholding payments from a grantee, GEPA requires the Department \n“notify the recipient, in writing, of—(1) the intent to withhold payments; (2) the factual and legal \nbasis for the Secretary’s belief that the recipient has failed to comply substantially with a \nrequirement of law; and (3) an opportunity for a hearing to be held on a date at least 30 days after \nthe notification has been sent to the recipient.” 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(b). \n173.  Administrative Law Judges within the Department “shall conduct” hearings to \nwithhold payments from grantees. See id. § 1234(a); see also 34 C.F.R. § 81.3(a). \n174.  Grantees are entitled to various procedural protections in the hearing, including the \nopportunity  to  present  oral  and  documentary  evidence  and  to  cross-examine  witnesses.  Id. \n§ 1234(f)(1); 5 U.S.C. § 556(d). The Department has the burden of proof for its termination \ndecision. 5 U.S.C. § 556(d).   \n175.  The Department’s regulations implementing GEPA provide additional procedures \ngoverning  hearings,  including  the  responsibilities  of  Administrative  Law  Judges  and  what \nevidence may be considered. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 81.1–81.20.  \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 39 of 59\n \n176.  Only after the Department “has given reasonable notice and an opportunity [for the \ngrantee to demonstrate] why future payments . . . should not be suspended” may it suspend funds \npending the outcome of the hearing. 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(d).  \n177.  The OMB Uniform Guidance requires, when an agency initiates a remedy for \nalleged noncompliance—including termination of the grant—that the agency “comply with any \nrequirements for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings to which the recipient or \nsubrecipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.” 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.342. \n178.  The OMB Uniform Guidance also provides a procedural backstop to the more \nspecific termination procedures required by Title VI, GEPA, and their implementing regulations.  \n179.  The OMB Uniform Guidance permits an agency to terminate a grant only after the \nagency has notified the grantee of its alleged noncompliance with the Constitution, federal law, or \nterms of the award and given the grantee an opportunity to cure by imposing “specific conditions” \non the grantee. 2 C.F.R. § 200.208(d); see also id. § 200.339.  \n180.  The agency may suspend or terminate the grant only if the agency “determines that \nnoncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.339.  \n181.  Before  terminating  a  grant,  the  agency  must  provide  written  notice  of  the \ntermination that includes “the reasons for termination.” Id. § 200.341(a).    \n182.  The Department cannot waive the requirements for grant termination imposed by \nthe OMB Guidance or the laws and regulations it incorporates. 34 C.F.R. § 75.900(a).  \n183.  Instead  of  following  these  procedures,  the  Department  terminated  the  EAC \nProgram and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant on the same day that it informed Plaintiff MAEC of its intent \nto withhold payments.  \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 40 of 59\n \n184.  Instead  of  following  these  procedures,  the  Department  terminated  the  EAC \nProgram and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant without stating any factual or legal basis for the Department’s \nclaim that Plaintiff MAEC had failed to comply substantially with a requirement of law.  \n185.  Instead of following these procedures, the Department did not notify Plaintiff \nMAEC of any opportunity for a hearing.  \n186.  In February 2025, the Department updated its procedures for appealing a grant \ntermination. The updated procedures do not provide any deadline for the Department to respond \nto the appeal, nor do they give grantees an opportunity for a hearing on their appeal.  \n187.  The Department also did not go through notice-and-comment rulemaking before \npublishing its new appeal procedures, as required by GEPA. 20 U.S.C. §1232(a). \n188.  The Department’s new appeal procedures therefore contravene GEPA.   \nIX. THE  DEPARTMENT’S  TERMINATION  OF  THE  EAC  GRANTS  HARMS \nPLAINTIFF MAEC’S STAFF, THE HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS, THOUSANDS OF \nEDUCATORS, AND MILLIONS OF STUDENTS THAT PLAINTIFF MAEC AND \nTHE OTHER EACS SERVE, INCLUDING PLAINTIFF NAACP MEMBERS, AND \nUNDERMINES THE GOALS OF TITLE VI AND TITLE IX. \n \n189.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff MAEC has been forced to \nterminate technical assistance and training for six school districts that sought help to prevent and \naddress special educational problems occasioned by desegregation, including discrimination in \nachievement, academic placement, discipline, and other policies and practices based on race, sex, \nnational origin, and religion. \n190.  Plaintiff MAEC does not have access to alternative funding sources that would \nallow it to continue providing technical assistance and training to these school districts or to \notherwise continue its operations under the EAC grant. \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 41 of 59\n \n191.  Without the technical assistance and training that Plaintiff MAEC provides at low \ncost or free of charge, these school districts lack the resources needed to improve student success \nand eradicate discrimination based on race, sex, national origin, and religion that may violate Title \nIV, Title VI, Title IX, and other civil rights laws. \n192.  For  example,  a  school  district  in Massachusetts  requested  intensive  technical \nassistance from Plaintiff MAEC to address discrimination and disparities in school discipline and \nacademic placement. In response to this request, Plaintiff MAEC conducted a comprehensive \nneeds  assessment  intended  to  guide  its  future  technical  assistance  work.  However,  the \nDepartment’s termination of Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant forced Plaintiff MAEC to immediately \ncease its data analysis, training, delivery of strategies to address disparities, discrimination, and \npotential violations of federal civil rights laws, and fulfillment of other terms of its memorandum \nof understanding with the district. \n193.  In response to the Department’s termination, the Superintendent of this district said, \n“[i]f the funds are not available to continue this project . . . [t]he academic achievement and \neducational outcome discrepancies historically seen within our school district . . . will continue to \npersist.” The Superintendent further noted that that district “lacks the resources and skills needed \nto complete the effort” Plaintiff MAEC was due to conduct in the district. \n194.  In addition, the Department’s termination of Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant has \nforced Plaintiff MAEC to terminate four key personnel with a combined 93 years of experience in \ntechnical assistance. The rest of Plaintiff MAEC’s team members were forced to reduce their \ncapacities to 80% because of the EAC termination. Plaintiff MAEC was also forced to lay off its \nProject Director, who had provided technical assistance and training in Region I for eight years \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 42 of 59\n \nand is critical to Plaintiff MAEC’s mission because of his vast experience serving in a variety of \nleadership roles at the state, district, and school levels of education.  \n195.  The Department’s termination of Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant has made it more \ndifficult for Plaintiff MAEC to continue its non-EAC work. For example, Plaintiff MAEC is \nplanning to host a convening in May 2025 related to family engagements, but three speakers have \ndropped out for fear of being targeted because of their association with Plaintiff MAEC.  \n196.  The termination has also forced Plaintiff MAEC to place fourteen remaining staff \non reduced capacity. As a result, those staff members are working only thirty-two hours per week \nand are receiving a reduced salary commensurate with their reduced hours.  \n197.  Plaintiff MAEC has been forced to give up its office space as a result of the \ntermination of the EAC grant. This has significantly limited Plaintiff MAEC’s ability to continue \nits operations. Plaintiff MAEC currently does not have a space to hold internal and external \nmeetings and easily access resources necessary to effectively and efficiently operate.    \n198.  Also, as a result of Defendants’ termination of the EAC grants, including Plaintiff \nMAEC’s grant, Plaintiff MAEC and the other EACS are no longer able to provide the targeted \ntechnical assistance that would support educators in revising policies and practices to ensure high-\nquality educational opportunities for all students. The Termination Letter directly and immediately \nharms the school district and students, including NAACP student members, who would otherwise \nbenefit from the services provided by EAC grantees. The Department’s decision to abruptly halt \nthe operation of the EAC program imposes a significant obstacle on school districts’ ability to \nserve all students equitably.   \n199.  Without this technical assistance, school districts served by Plaintiff MAEC and \nthe EACs are unable to address the discrimination and obstacles to equal educational access that \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 43 of 59\n \nharm students, particularly Black students and NAACP members, and hinder their academic \nperformance and social-emotional well-being. See supra Section III. \n200.  Similarly, the Termination Letter denies educators, including Plaintiff NAACP \nmembers, the ability to continue openly discussing and learning from trainings, instructional \nmaterials,  and  other  technical  assistance  programs  that  address  problems  occasioned  by \ndesegregation and promote equity and equal educational opportunity. By denying educators access \nto these programs, Defendants have denied educators the resources and tools to create a more \nsupportive environment for themselves and for students. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \nFifth Amendment – Due Process, Void for Vagueness \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n201.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n202.  Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, a governmental enactment \nis “void for vagueness” if it “fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence [fair notice of what \nis] prohibit[ed], or “authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Hill \nv. Colorado, 530 U.S. 707, 732 (2000) (citation omitted); accord F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012).  \n203.  Government enactments that “threaten[] to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally \nprotected rights,” including “the right of free speech,” are subject to “a more stringent vagueness \ntest.” Vill. of Hoffman Ests. v. Flipside, Hoffman Ests., Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982); see also \nF.C.C., 567 U.S. at 253–54. The prohibition against vagueness “applies with particular force in \nreview of laws dealing with speech.” Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Turner, 893 F.2d 1387, \n1395 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 44 of 59\n \n204.  The Termination Letter and the “priorities” referenced therein along with the \nrelated Executive Orders, do not provide “a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it \nprohibits” and they “authorize[] or even encourage[] arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” \nHill, 530 U.S. at 732.  \n205.  The Termination Letter purports to terminate the EAC Program, including Plaintiff \nMAEC’s grant and similar programs, because the EAC Programs constitute diversity, equity, and \ninclusion  programs  disfavored  by  Defendants  and  the  Executive  Orders  and  because  such \nprograms and the EAC grant purportedly conflict with the Department’s “priorities.” But the \nExecutive Orders and the Termination Letter do not provide clear definitions of these terms and \npriorities. These documents fail to define foundational terms like “[i]llegal DEI policies and \npractices.” See NAACP v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2025 WL 1196212, at *6 (D.D.C. \nApr. 24, 2025); Chi. Women in Trades v. Trump, -- F. Supp. 3d --, No. 25 C 2005, 2025 WL \n933871, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2025). Nor does the Termination Letter describe which of Plaintiff \nMAEC’s programs purportedly conflict with the Department’s undefined priorities.  \n206.  Without appropriate notice of the conduct, speech, and activities that violate the \nDefendants’ purported “priorities,” Plaintiff MAEC cannot meaningfully contest the Department’s \ndetermination that its programs are in conflict with those priorities. \n207.  The  Termination  Letters’  vague  and  undefined  terms  and  the  Department’s \nsimilarly  vague  “priorities”  lend  themselves  to  subjective  interpretation  and  discriminatory \nenforcement.  Department  of  Education  officials  are left to exercise unfettered discretion to \ndetermine whether grant recipients engage in conduct or speech that run afoul of these “priorities.” \n208.  The  Termination  Letter’s  vague  and  undefined  justifications  have  irreparably \nharmed Plaintiff MAEC. \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 45 of 59\n \n209.  The  ability  of  NAACP  educator  members  to  continue  receiving  training, \ninstructional materials, and other technical assistance programming is directly affected by the \nvague prohibitions imposed on the EACs, including Plaintiff MAEC.  \n210.  Defendants’ vague prohibitions infringe upon NAACP members’ liberty interest in \nreceiving this protected speech. NAACP, 2025 WL 1196212, at *5, *7; see also Arce v. Douglas, \n793 F.3d 968, 988 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding a right-to-receive injury where a plaintiff challenged a \nvague statute alleged to have “a direct impact on plaintiffs’ right to receive information.”) \n211.  Accordingly, the Termination Letter is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the \nPlaintiff MAEC and Plaintiff NAACP’s rights under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \nSecond Cause of Action \nFirst Amendment – Viewpoint Discrimination \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n212.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.   \n213.  The First Amendment provides that the government “shall make no law . . . \nabridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I.      \n214.  Content-based regulations that “target speech based on its communicative content” \nare presumptively unconstitutional and “justified only if the government proves that they are \nnarrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.”  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 \n(2015); Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214-15 (2013) \n(“AID”); Minn. Voters All. v. Mansky, 585 U.S. 1, 12 (2018). \n215.  Viewpoint discrimination, or discrimination against speech because of the opinion \nor perspective of the speaker, is also presumptively unconstitutional and is the most “egregious \nform of content discrimination.” Reed, 576 U.S. at 163, 168–69; Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors \nof Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 828–89 (1995). \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 46 of 59\n \n216.  While the government may terminate grantees for poor performance or to improve \nservices offered to the public, federal grantees retain First Amendment rights. See Board of Cnty. \nCom’rs, Wabaunsee Cnty. v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674 (1996). Although the government may \nchoose to fund one activity to the exclusion of another, it may not, however, make this decision \nbecause it disagrees with a grantee’s viewpoint. See id. at 677–78. \n217.  First, the government may not “leverage funding to regulate speech outside the \ncontours of the program itself.” AID, 570 U.S. at 214–15. \n218.  Second, the government may not terminate a grant “because of the [grantee’s] \nspeech on matters of public concern.” Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 675. \n219.  Defendants’ termination of the EAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant violates \nPlaintiff MAEC’s First Amendment rights because it impermissibly restricts the exercise of \nPlaintiff MAEC’s constitutionally protected speech and expressive conduct, including speech \noutside the scope of the grant, based on its content and viewpoint.  \n220.  Specifically, the Termination Letter and the Executive Orders target “equity-related” \ngrants and state that the Department is targeting grants that fund “organizations [that] promote or \ntake part in diversity, equity, and inclusion . . . initiatives,” [emphasis added] regardless of whether \nthe grant is funding diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and without any definition of \ndiversity, equity and inclusion.  \n221.  Defendants therefore target speech and expressive conduct that is “equity-related” \nor that promotes the viewpoint of “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” Without defining the speech \nand expressive activities captured by that broad viewpoint, Defendants terminated MAEC’s grant \non the basis that MAEC promotes that viewpoint. \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 47 of 59\n \n222.  The Termination Letter also does not define what activities by MAEC violate \nDefendants’ targeted viewpoint. Plaintiff MAEC promotes and takes part in programs that remedy \ndiscrimination and try to prevent future discrimination, including equity audits, landscape analyses, \ntraining and technical assistance, webinars, and podcasts, and produces equity-related resources \nand tools unrelated to the EAC grant. In targeting “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” Defendants’ \nTermination Letter targets these efforts and other speech and activities whereby Plaintiff MAEC \nexpresses its viewpoints regarding race and sex discrimination, among other issues, as well as \nPlaintiff MAEC’s view of the Civil Rights Act, the Fourteenth Amendment, and other federal laws. \n223.  The  Defendants  failed  to  explain  in  their  Termination  Letter  and  cannot \ndemonstrate  how  Plaintiff  MAEC’s  alleged  promotion  of  “diversity,  equity  and  inclusion” \npractices render it difficult for Plaintiff MAEC to effectuate the underlying goals of the grant. Nor \ncan Defendants demonstrate that the goals of the grant could only be effectuated by a grantee who \nshared the Defendant’s ideological beliefs about “diversity, equity and inclusion.” In fact, as \ndiscussed above—see supra Section V—MAEC’s technical assistance and other work has yielded \nmeasurable  results  for  school  districts,  families,  and  students  in  preventing  and  remedying \nviolations of federal civil rights laws.  \n224.  Accordingly, the Termination Letter unconstitutionally penalizes Plaintiff MAEC’s \nprotected speech on the basis of its content and viewpoint without any compelling interest.    \n225.  The First Amendment also protects Plaintiff NAACP educator members’ right to \nreceive information and ideas. Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141 (1943); Lamont v. Postmaster \nGen. of U.S., 381 U.S. 301 (1965). This right to receive information and ideas gives true effect to \nthe “recipient’s meaningful exercise of [their] own rights of speech, press, and political freedom.” \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 48 of 59\n \nBd. of Educ., Island Trees Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 867 (1982) (plurality \nopinion). \n226.  By impeding Plaintiff MAEC and the other EACs’ ability to provide training, \ninstructional materials, and other technical assistance programming on certain topics disfavored \nby  Defendants,  the  Termination  Letter  and  Defendants’  termination  of  the  EAC  program \nunlawfully denies educators, including NAACP members, the right to receive information free \nfrom viewpoint and content-based restrictions. \n227.  As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff MAEC and Plaintiff NAACP \nhave suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm.   \nThird Cause of Action \nFifth Amendment – Procedural Due Process \n(Plaintiff MAEC Against All Defendants) \n \n228.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n229.  “A procedural due process violation under the Fifth Amendment occurs when a \ngovernment official deprives a person of property without appropriate procedural protections—\nprotections that include, at minimum, the basic requirements of notice and an opportunity to be \nheard.” N. Am. Butterfly Ass’n v. Wolf, 977 F.3d 1244, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 2020). \n230.  Defendants funded the EAC Program for decades, from the 1960s through this year. \nSimilarly, Defendants also funded Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant from October 1, 2024, through \nSeptember 30, 2025. Plaintiff MAEC therefore had a property interest in the grant funding through \nthe end of the budget period. See Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972); \nCnty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 536 (N.D. Cal. 2017). \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 49 of 59\n \n231.  Defendants then terminated the EAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s EAC grant in \nthe middle of the budget period without providing Plaintiff MAEC any notice or an opportunity to \nbe heard.  \n232.  Accordingly, Defendants deprived Plaintiff MAEC of a property interest without \nproviding the constitutionally guaranteed due process protections. See Climate United Fund v. \nCitibank, N.A., No. 25-CV-698, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2025 WL 842360, at *7 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025). \n233.  As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff MEAC has suffered and will \ncontinue to suffer irreparable harm. \nFourth Cause of Action \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) – Contrary to Constitutional Rights \nunder the First and Fifth Amendments \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n234.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.   \n235.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside” agency action \nthat is “contrary to constitutional right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  \n236.  The Termination Letter constitutes a final agency action subject to judicial review \nbecause it marks the “consummation” of the Department’s decision-making process, sets forth the \nDepartment’s  conclusions  that  Plaintiff  MAEC  is  acting  unlawfully,  and  proscribes  new \nsubstantive obligations “from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n154,  178  (1997)  (quoting  Port  of  Boston  Marine  Terminal  Assn.  v.  Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970)). \n237.  The Termination Letter violates Plaintiff MAEC and Plaintiff NAACP’s Fifth \nAmendment right to due process and prohibition against vagueness and the First Amendment right \nto freedom of speech, as set forth above. Supra pp. 42–48.   \n238.  Defendants’ conduct has and will continue to irreparably harm Plaintiff MAEC.  \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 50 of 59\n \n239.  Accordingly, the Termination Letter must be set aside under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).   \nFifth Cause of Action \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) – Arbitrary and Capricious; Not in \nAccordance with Law \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n240.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n241.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.SC. § 706(2)(A). \n242.  The Termination Letter constitutes a final agency action subject to judicial review.  \n243.  That  Plaintiff  MAEC’s  Termination  Letter  is  substantively  identical  to  the \ntermination letters received by over a hundred other Department of Education grantees further \ndemonstrates the lack of reasoned decision-making. See AACTE, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 \n(describing the substantively identical termination letters that the Department sent to grantees and \nexplaining that “the Department’s use of a template or boilerplate letter issued to all Grant \nRecipients  further  strengthen[ed]  Plaintiffs’  argument  that  the  Department  did  not  consider \nindividual,  or  any,  data  or  information.”).  Defendants  used  the  fiction  of  individual  grant \ntermination determinations, in the form of identical and unsupported Termination Letters and \nupdated GANs, to undertake the undisclosed purpose of entirely terminating the Congressionally \nauthorized EAC Program.  \n244.  The Termination Letter failed to provide reasoned decision-making for terminating \nPlaintiff MAEC’s grant and the EAC Program. Indeed, the Termination Letter provides no \nreasoning specific to Plaintiff MAEC for terminating its grant.  \n245.  The Termination Letter also failed to consider the reliance interests of Plaintiff \nMAEC and the school districts it serves. \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 51 of 59\n \n246.  The Termination Letter alleges new priorities and deviates from ED’s longstanding \npositions and guidance on Title VI and Title IX without explanation. See supra Section V; see also \nEncino Motorcars, LLC, 579 U.S. at 221–22; Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of \nCal., 591 U.S. 1, 33 (2020). \n247.  The Department based its decision to terminate the EAC Program and Plaintiff \nMAEC’s grant on factors that Congress did not authorize the Department to consider. The \nDepartment’s stated “priorities” in the Termination Letter—including opposition to organizations \nthat promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives—are not the priorities that \nthe Department has established through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  \n248.  To the contrary, Plaintiff MAEC’s conduct is fully consistent with the priorities \nthat the Department has established through notice-and-comment rulemaking. See supra pp. 27–\n29. By terminating Plaintiff MAEC’s grant based on agency “priorities” not established through \nrulemaking, the Department considered factors beyond what Congress intended the Department to \nconsider.   \n249.  Further, the Termination Letter is not in accordance with the GEPA, which only \nallows  the  Department  to  withhold  funds  from  a  grantee  if  the  grantee  fails  to  “comply \nsubstantially” with any law applicable to such funds. 20 U.S.C. § 1234c(a); see supra Section VIII.  \nThe Department also violated GEPA by (i) terminating Plaintiff MAEC’s grant without notifying \nMAEC of the factual and legal basis for the Department’s belief that MEAC failed to comply \nsubstantially with a requirement of law; and by (ii) failing to provide MAEC an opportunity to be \nheard after MAEC received the Termination Letter. See supra Section VIII.      \n250.  Defendants’ conduct has and will continue to irreparably harm Plaintiff MAEC. \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 52 of 59\n \n251.  In addition, Defendants’ arbitrary and capricious termination of the EAC Program \nand grants, including Plaintiff MAEC’s grant, harms Plaintiff NAACP’s members. Defendants’ \nconduct eliminates the provision of technical assistance from the EAC program and EAC grantees \nnecessary to ensure NAACP members’ equal educational access by furthering their schools’ \ndesegregation  efforts  and  by  improving  their  schools’  compliance  with  civil  rights  laws. \nDefendants’ conduct also denies educators who are NAACP members the ability to learn from and \nfreely discuss technical assistance programs and resources that promote desegregation and equity. \n252.  Defendants  deny  NAACP  members  EAC  programs  and  resources  without \njustification, reasoned analysis, or consideration of Plaintiff NAACP’s reliance interests. See \nEncino Motorcars, LLC, 579 U.S. at 222; Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 591 U.S. at 33. \n253.  In sum, Defendants’ termination of the EAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant \nwas both arbitrary and capricious in violation of all Plaintiff’s rights and was not in accordance \nwith federal law and must be set aside under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nSixth Cause of Action \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) – In Excess of Statutory Authority \nUnder Title VI and Title IX \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n254.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n255.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 \nU.SC. § 706(2)(C). \n256.  The Termination Letter constitutes a final agency action subject to judicial review.  \n257.  The Department’s termination of the EAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant \nexceeds Defendants’ authority under Title VI and Title IX. 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d–2000d-7; 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681. \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 53 of 59\n \n258.  Title VI provides that no student “shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin,  be  excluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefit[]  of,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. § \n2000d.  \n259.  In excess of the Department’s authority under Title VI and contrary to longstanding \nTitle VI precedent, including the Department’s past guidance, the Department’s termination of the \nEAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant claims that lawful technical assistance to advance \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion violates Title VI. See supra Section VIII.  This is unsupported by \nTitle VI and disregards the Department’s prior guidance requiring schools to implement similar \nmeasures to prevent and remedy Title VI violations.   \n260.  Title IX provides that no student “shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n261.  In excess of the Department’s authority under Title IX and contrary to longstanding \nTitle IX precedent, including the Department’s past guidance, the Department’s termination of the \nEAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant claims that lawful technical assistance to advance \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion violates Title IX. See supra Section VII. \n262.  The Department’s termination of Plaintiff MAEC’s grant also disregards the terms \nof the grant, which require Plaintiff MAEC to provide technical assistance in furtherance of Title \nVI, Title IX, and other federal civil rights laws. \n263.  The  Department  has  provided  no  justification  for  its  abandonment  of  its \nlongstanding positions on Title VI and Title IX, but instead “depart[s] from . . . prior policy sub \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 54 of 59\n \nsilentio.” See Encino Motorcars, LLC, 579 U.S. at 221–22; Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 591 U.S. at \n33. \n264.  Further, Defendants failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Title VI \nand its implementing regulations before terminating the EAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n265.  Defendants have no statutory authorization to terminate a grant for alleged Title VI \nviolations without following these procedural requirements.  \n266.  Defendants’ conduct has and will continue to irreparably harm Plaintiff MAEC. \n267.  In addition, Defendants’ conduct harms Plaintiff NAACP members by terminating \ntechnical assistance programs necessary to protect NAACP student members’ equal educational \naccess and by denying NAACP educator members the ability to learn from and freely discuss \ntechnical assistance programs and resources that promote desegregation and equity.   \n268.  Defendants’ termination of the EAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant should \nbe set aside as “not in accordance with law,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(C).  \nSeventh Cause of Action \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D) – Without Observance of Procedure \nRequired by Law \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n269.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n270.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.SC. § 706(2)(D).  \n271.  The Termination Letter constitutes a final agency action subject to judicial review.  \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 55 of 59\n \n272.  Defendants are not permitted to waive the requirements of any regulation that \napplies to EAC grants “unless the regulation specifically provides that it may be waived.” 34 C.F.R. \n§ 75.900(a). \n273.  Defendants did not follow any of the termination procedures required by Title VI \nand its implementing regulations. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1; 34 C.F.R. § 100.8. \n274.  Defendants did not follow any of the termination procedures required by GEPA \nbefore terminating Plaintiff MAEC’s grant. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1234, 1234c(a), 1234d(b), (c). \n275.  Defendants did not follow any of the termination procedures required by the OMB \nUniform Guidance. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339, 200.341(a). \n276.  Defendants claimed that they were terminating Plaintiff MAEC’s grant—and the \nEAC Program—because it was inconsistent with agency priorities. Defendants did not enact these \nnew purported “priorities” through notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by GEPA. See 20 \nU.S.C. § 1232(d). See AACTE, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (explaining the Department’s requirement \nto go through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process unless one of three narrow exceptions \napplies). Therefore, Defendants are not authorized by the applicable statutes and regulations to \nterminate the grant on the grounds asserted.   \n277.  Defendants’ conduct has and will continue to irreparably harm Plaintiff MAEC. \n278.  Defendants’ conduct harms Plaintiff NAACP members by terminating technical \nassistance programs necessary to protect NAACP student members’ equal educational access and \nby denying NAACP educator members the ability to learn from and freely discuss technical \nassistance programs and resources that promote desegregation and equity.   \n279.  Accordingly, the Department’s termination of the EAC Program and Plaintiff \nMAEC’s grant must be set aside for failure to observe the procedures required by law. \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 56 of 59\n \nEighth Cause of Action \nU.S. Const. art. I, §§ 1, 8 – Violation of Separation of Powers \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n280.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n281.  This Court is authorized “to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal \nofficers,” including actions that contravene our Constitution’s separation of powers principle. \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015); see also Free Enter. Fund v. \nPub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010). \n282.  The Spending Clause vests “the power of the purse” exclusively in the legislative \nbranch. See U.S. Const., art. I, § 8. Accordingly, “Congress has broad power . . . to set the terms \non which it disburses federal funds.” Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, \n216 (2022). \n283.  By enacting GEPA, Congress set specific terms for the disbursement of federal \nfunds by limiting Defendants’ authority to withhold funding granted through Department programs, \nincluding the EAC Program. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1221(b), (c). \n284.  Defendants terminated the EAC Program and Plaintiff MAEC’s grant without \nfollowing any of the procedures required by Congress under GEPA. See id. §§ 1234, 1234c, \n1234d(b), (c); 34 C.F.R. § 81.3. \n285.  Defendants purported to terminate the EAC Program Plaintiff MAEC’s grant \nbecause of inconsistencies with  agency  priorities, but  Defendants did not  promulgate these \npurported new “priorities” through notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by Congress \nunder GEPA. See 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d). \n286.

Defendants’ conduct has and will continue to irreparably harm Plaintiff MAEC. \n288.  Defendants’ conduct harms Plaintiff NAACP members by terminating technical \nassistance programs necessary to protect NAACP student members’ equal educational access and \nby denying NAACP educator members the ability to learn from and freely discuss technical \nassistance programs and resources that promote desegregation and equity.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court:  \na.

Compl. [Dkt. No. 33] ¶¶ 31, 37.  \nCEE is a technical assistance center designed to confront federal school desegregation cases in \n“Region I,” which includes Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nNew Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Vermont, \n \n  1  The Court has reviewed the following documents and attachments thereto in \nconnection with the pending motion:  Complaint (“Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 1]; Amended Complaint \n(“Am. Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 33]; Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [Dkt. No. 14]; \nPlaintiffs’ ERRATA Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (“Pls. Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 15]; \nDefendants’ Opposition to the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (“Defs. Opp.”) [Dkt. No. 26]; \nPlaintiffs’ Reply in Further Support of the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (“Pls. Reply”) \n[Dkt. No. 30]; Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction (“Pls. Suppl.”) [Dkt. No. 36]; Plaintiffs’ Revised Proposed Order \n(“Pls. Revised Proposed Order”) [Dkt. No. 36-2]; Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Revised \nProposed Order (“First Defs. Suppl.”) [Dkt.

No. 38]; and Plaintiffs’ Reply \nin Support of Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Memorandum of Law (“Pls. Suppl. Reply”) [Dkt. No. 40]. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 2 of 42\nWest Virginia, and the Virgin Islands.  See id. ¶ 31.  But CEE’s programming grinded to a halt \non February 13, 2025, when the Department terminated MAEC’s grant.  See id. ¶¶ 86, 110.     \n    On May 22, 2025, plaintiff MAEC, for itself, and plaintiffs National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People (“NAACP”), Tennessee State Conference of the \nNAACP (“Tennessee NAACP”), and NAACP Fayette-Somerville Branch (“Fayette NAACP”) \n(collectively, “the NAACP Plaintiffs”), for their members, moved for a preliminary injunction \nagainst the Department and Linda M. McMahon, in her official capacity as Secretary of \nEducation.  See Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [Dkt. No. 14], as corrected by \nPlaintiffs’ ERRATA Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (“Pls. Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 15].  Plaintiffs \nchallenge defendants’ decision to terminate several EAC grants—including MAEC’s EAC \ngrant—and they request immediate declaratory and injunctive relief.  See generally Pls. Mot.   \n    The Court held oral argument on plaintiffs’ motion on July 8, 2025.  Upon careful \nconsideration of the parties’ filings, the oral arguments, and the relevant legal authorities, the \nCourt concludes that:  (i) MAEC has demonstrated organizational standing to sue on its own \nbehalf, (ii) MAEC is likely to succeed on the merits of its APA claims, and (iii) MAEC has been \nirreparably harmed.  The Court therefore will grant MAEC’s motion for a preliminary injunction. \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The EAC Grant Program \n    To effectuate the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education to \ndesegregate schools “with all deliberate speed,” Congress enacted Title IV of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 (“Title IV”).  See Am. Compl. ¶ 24; see also 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000c et seq.  Title IV \ndirects the Department to provide technical assistance to facilitate public school desegregation \ninitiatives, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2, and to “arrange, through grants or contracts, . . . institutes \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 3 of 42\nfor special training designed to improve the ability of [school personnel] to deal effectively with \nspecial educational problems occasioned by desegregation.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000c-3.   \n    Pursuant to Title IV, the Department established the Equity Assistance Center \n(“EAC”) Program, through which the Department “operates a competitive grant process for \norganizations to seek funding to provide desegregation assistance to school districts and local \neducational agencies (‘LEAs’).”  Pls. Mot. at 2 (citing 34 C.F.R. §§ 270.1-270.5, 270.7).2  \nSince 2016, the Department has divided the United States and territories into four regions and \nhas awarded EAC grants to four grantees, each of which provides technical assistance, upon \nrequest, to public schools within its assigned geographical region.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 30.  EAC \nProgram grantees are called “Equity Assistance Centers” or “EACs,” 3 see Pls. Mot. at 2 \n(citing 34 C.F.R.§ 270.1), and these EACs help schools “develop[ ] effective strategies to ensure \nall students have a full opportunity to participate in educational programs.”  Applications for \nNew Awards: Equity Assistance Centers, 87 Fed. Reg. 8564, 8564 (Feb. 15, 2022). \n    On February 15, 2022, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, the \nDepartment published a Notice Inviting Applications for the FY2022 EAC grant competition.  \nSee Am. Compl. ¶ 122; see also 87 Fed. Reg. 8564-70.  The Notice stated that the Department \n \n  2  The “desegregation assistance” that EACs provide “may include, among other \nactivities, (1) Dissemination of information regarding effective methods of coping with special \neducational problems occasioned by desegregation; (2) Assistance and advice in coping with \nthese problems; and (3) Training designed to improve the ability of teachers, supervisors, \ncounselors, parents, community members, community organizations, and other elementary or \nsecondary school personnel to deal effectively with special educational problems occasioned by \ndesegregation.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 33 (quoting 34 C.F.R. § 270.4(c) (2025)). \n \n  3  EACs were initially named “Desegregation Assistance Centers,” but the \nDepartment changed the Centers’ name in 2016 to reflect their broadened mission.  See Southern \nEduc. Found. v. United States Dep’t of Educ. (“Southern Educ.”), Civil Action No. 25-1079 \n(PLF), 2025 WL 1453047, at *2 (D.D.C. May 21, 2025). \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 4 of 42\nwas “particularly interested” in applications addressing the following priority:  “Promoting \nEquity Through Diverse Partnerships.”  87 Fed. Reg. 8566.  The EAC Program’s authorizing \nstatutes set forth application procedures for the grant competition.  See 37 C.F.R. 270 (2025). \n \nB.  Plaintiff MAEC \n    Plaintiff MAEC is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) corporation.  See Pls. Mot. at 3; see also \nDeclaration of Karmen Rouland (“Rouland Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 15-4] ¶ 3.  Since 1992, the \nDepartment “has repeatedly awarded MAEC an EAC grant” to provide technical assistance to \nschool districts and LEAs upon request.  Pls. Mot. at 3.  And since 2016, MAEC has served as \nthe EAC for Region I.  See id.; see also Declaration of Susan Shaffer (“Shaffer Decl.”) [Dkt. \nNo. 15-3] ¶¶ 3, 7; Declaration of Daryl Williams (“Williams Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 15-5] ¶ 17. \n    In 2022, MAEC submitted an application for the Department’s FY2022 EAC \ngrant competition, requesting a grant to operate the CEE program for Region I.  See MAEC-CEE \nEquity Consortium Application (“MAEC-CEE Appl.”) [Dkt. No. 15-7].  As of February 2022, \n“Region I had 177 open Title VI investigations at elementary and secondary schools,” for \nincidents “ranging from Racial Harassment, to Denial of Benefits, to Discipline.”  Id. at 6.  In its \nEAC grant application, MAEC proposed several projects aimed at resolving these open Title VI \ncases, see id. at 6-7, as well as fulfilling the Department’s competition priority of “Promoting \nEquity Through Diverse Partnerships.”  See id. at 61-65; see also 87 Fed. Reg. 8566.  For \nexample, MAEC proposed a partnership with Capital Community College, a minority-serving \ninstitution, to support its dual enrollment programs during the 2024-2025 grant year.  See \nMAEC-CEE Appl. at 64; see also Am. Compl. ¶ 128; Williams Decl. ¶ 12. \nFollowing a competitive selection process, the Department awarded MAEC a \nfive-year EAC grant under Title IV to operate the CEE in Region I.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 39.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 5 of 42\nUnder the grant agreement, MAEC was scheduled to receive $8,214,498 over five years to \noperate the CEE in Region I from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2027.  See Am. Compl. \n¶ 41.  MAEC’s most recent Grant Award Notification (“GAN”) letter awarded \nMAEC $1,686,452 for the period of October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.  See id. ¶ 42.   \n    Since receiving its most recent grant award in 2022, MAEC, through the CEE, has \nhelped “states, districts, schools, and community-based organizations . . . address discrimination \nand segregation on the basis of race, national origin, sex, or religion.”  Pls. Mot. at 4; see also \nShaffer Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9.  In 2024, the CEE supplied technical assistance to three public schools in \nMaine seeking to “reduce racial opportunity gaps” in the classroom, and ultimately “achiev[ed] \ndecreases in the racial opportunity gap as high as 10.6% in Math and 10.1% in English Language \nArts.”  Pls. Mot. at 4.  CEE has also “helped 17 school districts in New York State significantly \nreduce the racially disproportionate use of school discipline.”  Id.; Williams Decl. ¶ 23.  The \nDepartment regularly reviewed MAEC’s work, and at its most recent annual review in \nJanuary 2025, MAEC received exceptional feedback.  See Pls. Mot. at 5; Williams Decl. ¶ 21. \n \nC.  The NAACP Plaintiffs \n    Plaintiffs NAACP, Tennessee NAACP, and Fayette NAACP are not-for-profit \norganizations.  See Pls. Mot. at 5.  The NAACP has over 2,200 local branches, 371 college \nchapters, and 23 high school chapters across the country.  Pls. Mot. at 5; see also Declaration of \nDerrick Lewis (“Lewis Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 15-8] ¶ 7.  The Tennessee NAACP is a “state \nconference of the NAACP,” while the Fayette NAACP is a “local unit” of the NAACP and the \nTennessee NAACP.  Am. Compl. ¶ 16.  “Members of the Tennessee NAACP are also members \nof the national NAACP, [and] [m]embers of the Fayette NAACP are also members of” the \nNAACP and the Tennessee NAACP.  Am.

No. 15-10] ¶ 4; Declaration of Elton Holmes (“Holmes Decl.”) \n[Dkt. No. 15-9] ¶ 3.  Put another way, the NAACP Plaintiffs’ membership is fully captured by \nPlaintiff NAACP’s membership, which consists of “educators and families in every state, \nincluding Black students who attend PK-12 schools throughout the country and Black educators \nwho teach in PK-12 schools throughout the country.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 15; see also Pls. Mot at 5-6. \n    The NAACP Plaintiffs allege that their members’ equal access to education \ndepends upon the development of “practices that prevent and redress discrimination” in school \nsettings, “including through the technical assistance services made available by the EAC \nProgram.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 15.  Specifically, “[t]echnical assistance from EACs . . . help[ ] K-12 \nschools better respond to discrimination and ensure equal educational opportunities for Black \nstudents and equal professional opportunities for Black educators.”  Pls. Mot. at 7. \n \nD.  Change of Administration and Executive Orders \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump was sworn in as President of the United \nStates.  That same day, he signed Executive Order 14151, titled “Ending Radical and Wasteful \nGovernment DEI Programs and Preferencing.”  See Exec. Order No. 14151, Ending Radical and \nWasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (In \norder to “mak[e] America great,” all DEI programs “end[] today.”).  Executive Order 14151 \ndirects “[e]ach agency, department, or commission head” to “terminate, to the maximum extent \nallowed by law . . .  all ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, [and] \n‘equity-related’ grants or contracts . . . .’”  Id. at § 2(b)(i), Implementation (emphasis added). \n    The next day, on January 21, 2025, President Trump signed Executive \nOrder 14173, titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.”  \nSee Exec. Order No. 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 7 of 42\nOpportunity, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, 2025).  Ostensibly in order to enforce “longstanding \ncivil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences,” id. at § 2, Executive \nOrder 14173 directs “all executive departments and agencies” to “terminate all discriminatory \nand illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, \nenforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements.”  Id.  \n \nE.  February 2025 Termination of MAEC’s Grant \nOn February 13, 2025, MAEC received a letter from the Department, which read: \nThis letter provides notice that the United States Department of \nEducation is terminating your federal award, S004D220002.  See 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340-43; see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.253.  \nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates.  The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment’s grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected characteristic.   Illegal  DEI policies  and practices can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education.  In addition to complying with the civil \nrights laws, it is vital that the Department assess whether all grant \npayments are free from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to \nassess  whether  current  grants  are  in  the  best  interests  of  the \nUnited States.  \nThe  grant  specified  above  provides  funding  for  programs  that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that \nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nnational  origin,  or  another  protected  characteristic;  that  violate \neither the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict \nwith the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and \nexcellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the \nUnited States.  The grant is therefore inconsistent with, and no \nlonger  effectuates,  Department  priorities.  See  2  C.F.R. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 8 of 42\n§ 200.340(a)(4); see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.253.  Therefore, pursuant \nto,  among  other  authorities,  2  C.F.R.  §  200.339-43,  34  C.F.R. \n§ 75.253, and the termination provisions in your grant award, the \nDepartment  hereby  terminates  grant  No.  S004D220002  in  its \nentirety effective 2/13/25. \nShaffer Decl. App., Ex. A (“Termination Letter”) [Dkt. No. 15-3] at 1.   \n    Plaintiffs allege that the three other EAC grantees also received identical \ntermination letters from the Department on February 13, 2025.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 37.  The other \nEAC grantees are:  the Southern Education Foundation, which serves “Region II” (Alabama, \nArkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, \nTexas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia); the Midwest and Plains Equity Assistance Center, \nwhich serves “Region III” (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, \nNebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin); and the Western \nEducational Equity Assistance Center, which serves “Region IV” (Alaska, Arizona, California, \nColorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, \nWyoming, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam).  \nSee id. ¶ 31; see also Declaration of Susan Mundry (“Mundry Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 30-1] ¶¶ 2-3; \nDeclaration of Seena Skelton (“Skelton Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 30-2] ¶¶ 2-3. \n    The Termination Letter set forth an informal appeal process for MAEC to follow \nif it “wish[ed] to object to or challenge” the termination of the grant.  See Shaffer Decl. App., \nEx. A at 2.  The Letter directed MAEC to “submit information and documentation supporting \n[its] position in writing within 30 calendar days of the date of this termination notice.”  Id.  \nMAEC’s appeal had to contain the following: “1. a copy of the written notice of termination; \n2. the date [MAEC] received written notice of termination; 3. a brief statement of [MAEC’s] \nargument and the disputed factual, legal, or other issues; 4. the amount of funds or costs in \ndispute, if any; and 5. any other relevant documents.”  Id.  Lastly, the Letter provided the name \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 9 of 42\nand contact information of the Department official to whom appeals should be forwarded.  \nSee id.  In addition to the Termination Letter, MAEC also received a new GAN letter stating that \nMAEC’s grant was terminated because it was deemed “inconsistent with, and no longer \neffectuates, Department priorities.”  Am. Compl. at 94; see also Williams Decl. ¶ 32. \n    MAEC submitted a timely appeal to the Department on March 12, 2025, \nchallenging the termination of its grant.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 112.  The Department did not \nrespond, see id. ¶ 113, and MAEC withdrew its appeal on July 2, 2025.  Id. ¶ 114. \n \nF.  Procedural History \nOn May 8, 2025, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against defendants.  See Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 14-18.  Plaintiffs allege that “[d]efendants’ termination of the EAC program,” including \nMAEC’s EAC grant, violates plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment rights, see id. ¶¶ 202-12 (Count One), \nconstitutes viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment, see id. ¶¶ 213-28 (Count Two), \nviolates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), see id. ¶¶ 235-80 (Counts Four, Five, Six, \nand Seven), and violates separation of powers principles under Article I, §§ 1, 8 of the \nConstitution.  See id. ¶¶ 281-89 (Count Eight).  MAEC independently alleges that defendants’ \ntermination of its EAC grant violates MAEC’s Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights.  \nSee id. ¶¶ 229-34 (Count Three).  Plaintiffs move for preliminary relief on all counts except \nCount Eight—their separation of powers claim.  See Pls. Reply at 9 n.2.   \nAs noted, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on May 23, 2025.  \nSee Pls. Mot.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief.  See Am. Compl. at 56-57; see \nalso Proposed Order Granting Preliminary Injunction [Dkt. No. 15-14].  On July 2, 2025, \nplaintiffs filed a motion to supplement the record and amend their complaint pursuant to \nRule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Plaintiffs’ Motion to Supplement the \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 10 of 42\nRecord [Dkt. No. 31].  To their motion, plaintiffs attached a letter that MAEC sent to the \nDepartment on July 2, 2025, formally withdrawing MAEC’s administrative appeal challenging \nthe Department’s grant termination decision.  See id. at Ex. 1 [Dkt. No. 31-1].  The Court \ngranted plaintiffs’ motion by minute order, and gave plaintiffs leave to serve a supplemental \npleading.  See Minute Order of July 3, 2025.  On July 7, 2025, plaintiffs filed an amended \ncomplaint alleging that MAEC had withdrawn its administrative appeal.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 114. \nThe Court heard oral argument on plaintiffs’ motion on July 8, 2025.  See Minute \nEntry of July 8, 2025.  That same day, the Court directed plaintiffs to file a revised proposed \norder and a supplemental brief “providing the basis for the relief requested in the revised \nproposed order,” and gave defendants an opportunity to respond.  See Order of July 8, 2025 \n[Dkt. No. 35].  Plaintiff filed a revised proposed order and a supplemental brief on July 11, 2025.  \nSee Pls. Revised Proposed Order; Pls. Suppl.  Defendants responded to plaintiffs’ filings on \nJuly 14, 2025 and July 16, 2025.  See First Defs. Suppl.; Second Defs. Suppl.  Plaintiffs filed a \nreply in support of their supplemental brief on July 24, 2025.  See Pls. Suppl. Reply. \n \nII.  JURISDICTION \nDefendants advance three threshold jurisdictional arguments.  First, they contend \nthat because plaintiffs seek reinstatement of grant agreements between the Department and the \nEAC grantees, their claims sound in contract and therefore belong in the Court of Federal \nClaims—and not this Court—under the Tucker Act.  See Defs. Opp. at 6-10.  Second, defendants \nargue that because MAEC administratively appealed the Department’s termination decision, \nplaintiffs’ claims are not ripe.  Id. at 10-11.  And third, defendants argue that the NAACP \nPlaintiffs lack associational standing to sue on behalf of their members because “[a]ll of the \nharms referenced by Plaintiffs are far too attenuated—and in most cases, entirely separate from \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 11 of 42\nthe specific termination of the MAEC grant—to give rise to standing.”  Second Defs. Suppl. at 3; \nsee also Defs. Opp. at 13.  As such, defendants argue, plaintiffs have no standing to “seek relief \nbroader than a restoration of the MAEC grant,” and “this Court has no jurisdiction . . . to issue \nrelief to any other EAC grantee other than MAEC.”  Second Defs. Suppl. at 3. \nThe Court finds that defendants’ first and second arguments are foreclosed by this \nCourt’s recent opinion in Southern Educ. Found. v. United States Dep’t of Educ. (“Southern \nEduc.”), Civil Action No. 25-1079 (PLF), 2025 WL 1453047, at *5-12 (D.D.C. May 21, 2025).  \nBut the Court agrees that the NAACP plaintiffs have failed at this stage to establish associational \nstanding to sue on behalf of their members.  See Defs. Opp. at 13; Second Defs. Suppl. at 3.  The \nCourt therefore likely lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the NAACP Plaintiffs’ claims.   \n                    \n   A.  The Tucker Act and the Essence of Plaintiffs’ Claims \nBecause the “United States is immune from suit unless it unequivocally \nconsents,” Maine Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. 296, 322 (2020), plaintiffs \nrequesting emergency relief against the government must “identify an unequivocal waiver of \nsovereign immunity.”  Franklin-Mason v. Mabus, 742 F.3d 1051, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see also \nSouthern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *5.  Here, plaintiffs point to Section 702 of the APA as \nsuch a waiver that applies to their claims.  See Pls. Mot. at 12-13 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 702).   \nAs this Court explained in Southern Educ., the APA provides “a limited waiver of \nsovereign immunity” for persons “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.”  Southern \nEduc., 2025 WL 1453047, at *5 (quoting Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin. \n(“Crowley”), 38 F.4th 1099, 1105-06 (D.C. Cir. 2022)).  But Section 702’s waiver is not without \nlimits:  For one, it only applies to claimants “seeking relief other than money damages.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 702.  For another, “Section 702’s sovereign immunity waiver does not apply [ ] ‘if any \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 12 of 42\nother statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is \nsought.’”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 (quoting Perry Cap. LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 618 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017) and 5 U.S.C. § 702); see also Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *5. \n    Defendants contend that the Tucker Act “impliedly forbids” the APA’s waiver of \nsovereign immunity here.  See Defs. Opp. at 6.  As explained in Southern Educ., the Tucker Act  \nwaives  the  government’s  sovereign  immunity  from  actions \n“founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United \nStates.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  The D.C. Circuit has explained \nthat the Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims “exclusive \njurisdiction over breach of contract claims against the United States \nseeking more than $10,000 in damages.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 \n(quoting Hammer v. United States, 989 F.3d 1, 2 (D.C. Cir. 2021)) \n(emphasis added).  So if [plaintiffs’] claims are “‘at [their] essence’ \ncontractual,” then they fall within the scope of the Tucker Act and \nthis Court has no power to resolve them.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 \n(quoting  Megapulse,  Inc.  v.  Lewis  (“Megapulse”),  672 \nF.2d 959, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); see also 5 U.S.C. § 702 (providing \nthat the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity is inapplicable where \n“any other statute . . . impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”).   \nThe Supreme Court has cautioned, however, that “[n]ot every claim \ninvoking  the  Constitution,  a  federal  statute,  or  a  regulation  is \ncognizable under the Tucker Act.”  United States v. Mitchell, 463 \nU.S. 206, 216 (1983).  For example, the Court of Federal Claims \ngenerally is  not  the appropriate forum to  consider requests for \ninjunctive relief because it “has no power to grant equitable relief.”  \nBowen v. Massachusetts (“Bowen”), 487 U.S. 879, 905 (1988) \n(quoting  Richardson v.  Morris, 409 U.S.  464,  465 (1973)  (per \ncuriam)).  The D.C. Circuit has also made clear that the Tucker Act \nshould not be interpreted “so broad[ly] as to deny a court jurisdiction \nto consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than a \ncontractual relationship with the government.”  Megapulse, 672 \nF.2d at 968.  “[T]he mere fact that a court may have to rule on a \ncontract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, \nautomatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and \ndeprive  the  court  of  jurisdiction  it  might  otherwise  have.”  \nMegapulse, 672 F.2d at 968 (emphasis added).  Further, “[t]he fact \nthat a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another \nis  not  a  sufficient  reason  to  characterize  the  relief  as  ‘money \ndamages’” such that Section 702 of the APA’s waiver of sovereign \nimmunity is inapplicable.  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 13 of 42\nSouthern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *5.  Defendants argue that the Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims because “[p]laintiffs’ APA and non-APA claims are all based \nexpressly on MAEC’s grant and cooperative agreement,” and plaintiffs request “a contractual \nremedy in the form of an order to essentially pay money due under the grant and Cooperative \nAgreement.”  Defs. Opp. at 7.  According to defendants, the contractual nature of plaintiffs’ \nclaims and the relief sought “indicate [that] the contemplated relief” falls under the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, not this Court.  See id. at 10.     \nThe Court rejected these same Tucker Act arguments in Southern Educ., 2025 \nWL 1453047, at *5-11.  There, plaintiff Southern Education Foundation (“SEF”) brought several \nAPA and non-APA claims against the Department, challenging the sudden termination of its \nEAC grant.  See id. at *2-5.  Defendants argued that because SEF sought reinstatement of the \ngrant agreement, its claims sounded in contract and therefore belonged in the Court of Federal \nClaims under the Tucker Act.  See id. at *5.  After applying the “rights and remedies” test \narticulated by the D.C. Circuit in Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967, the Court concluded that SEF’s \nclaims were not in essence contractual such that jurisdiction lay exclusively in the Court of \nFederal Claims.  See Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *6.  Rather, SEF’s claims “turn[ed] \nentirely on examining the federal statutes and regulations governing SEF’s grant award[, and] the \nCourt need not look to the terms of the grant agreement at all to adjudicate SEF’s claims.”  \nId. at *7 (citing AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., Civil Action No. 25-1079 (PLF), 2025 \nWL 752378, at *9 (D.D.C. May 21, 2025) (“[I]t would be quite extraordinary to consider \nPlaintiffs’ claims to sound in breach of contract when they do not at all depend on whether the \nterms of particular awards were breached—they instead challenge whether the agency action \nhere was unlawful, irrespective of any breach.”). \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 14 of 42\nIn the instant case, plaintiffs bring several APA and non-APA claims against the \nDepartment, challenging the sudden termination of several EAC grants, including MAEC’s EAC \ngrant.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 202-89.  Defendants make no attempt to differentiate the Tucker Act \narguments they advance here from the arguments this Court rejected in Southern Educ.—in fact, \ndefendants do not even cite Southern Educ. in their briefs.  See Pls. Reply at 2.  So for the same \nreasons this Court articulated in Southern Educ., the Court finds that plaintiffs’ claims do not \nsound in contract.  See 2025 WL 1453047, at *6-11.  Therefore “this Court—not the Court of \nFederal Claims—is the appropriate forum to adjudicate [plaintiffs’] suit.”  Id. at *7.4  \nThis Court is far from the first in this Circuit to consider the Tucker Act’s \napplicability to federal grant terminations.  Indeed, as Judge Mehta noted in a recent opinion, \n \n  4  There is one important difference between SEF’s requested relief and plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief:  Plaintiffs here ask the Court to extend the performance period of MAEC’s EAC \ncontinuation grant agreement for 320 days from the date of the reinstatement of the grant.  See \nPls. Reply at 24.  According to plaintiffs, this extension would account for the 230 days left in \nthe 2024-2025 grant year, plus the 90 days that MAEC alleges it will need to restart its EAC \nprojects and rehire staff.  See id.  Plaintiffs also ask the Court to extend the performance period \nof the grant agreements between the three other EACs and the Department.  See id.  Following \noral argument, the Court ordered plaintiffs to file a revised proposed order and a supplemental \nbrief “providing the basis for . . . the Court’s authority to direct defendants to extend the term for \n[MAEC’s EAC] continuation grant.”  Order of July 8, 2025.   \n \n    Upon consideration of plaintiffs’ supplemental brief, defendants’ responses, and \nplaintiffs’ reply, the Court declines plaintiffs’ request to modify the performance period of the \ngrant agreements.  First, as defendants note, “[t]he performance period of the EAC grant contract \nis a substantive term of [each] cooperative agreement.”  Second Defs. Suppl. at 2.  Though the \nDepartment may voluntarily modify the performance period of a grant agreement, see Pls. Suppl. \nat 5, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that this Court has the authority to do so unilaterally, \nover the Department’s objection.  See First Defs. Suppl. at 1-2; see also Second Defs. Suppl. \nat 1-3.  Moreover, as this Court explained in Southern Educ., SEF’s claims were not contractual \nin nature—and therefore the Court had jurisdiction over them—in part because the Court could \nadjudicate SEF’s claims without looking to the terms of the grant agreement.  See Southern \nEduc., 2025 WL 1453047, at *7.  The same cannot be said of plaintiffs’ request for the Court to \nmodify a substantive term of the grant agreements between the EACs and the Department, which \nimplicates the same jurisdictional concerns. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 15 of 42\nthere is an “ongoing controversy” in the D.C. Circuit—and in courts all over the country—“over \nwhether federal grant termination cases belong in federal district courts or in the Court of Federal \nClaims.”  Vera Institute of Justice v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice (“Vera Inst. v. DOJ”), Civil Action \nNo. 25-1643 (APM), 2025 WL 1865160, at *6 (D.D.C. July 7, 2025) (collecting cases).   \nThe D.C. Circuit recently had occasion to consider the Tucker Act’s applicability \nin federal grant termination cases.  In Widakuswara v. Lake (“Widakuswara II”), \nNo. 25-5144, 2025 WL 1288817 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2025), a motions panel concluded that the \ndistrict court likely lacked jurisdiction under the Tucker Act to restore plaintiffs’ federal grants.  \nThe Court summarized Widakuswara II in Southern Educ. as follows:  \nIn Widakuswara v. Lake, the United States Agency for Global \nMedia  (“USAGM”)  terminated  two  of  its  affiliates’  grant \nagreements for the 2025 fiscal year. See Widakuswara II, 2025 \nWL 1288817,  at  *1.    The  grantees  filed  suit  in  this  Court, \nchallenging the USAGM’s termination of their grants, bringing \nclaims  under  the  APA,  the  United  States  Constitution,  various \ncongressional appropriations acts, “and numerous other statutory \nprovisions.” Widakuswara v. Lake (Widakuswara I”), Civil Action \nNo.  25-1015  (RCL),  2025  WL  1166400,  at  *5  (D.D.C. \nApr. 22, 2025).  Judge Lamberth granted plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction, and ordered the government to “restore the \nFY  2025  grants”  and  “disburse[  ]  to  [the  grantees]  the  funds \nCongress appropriated.”  Id. at *18.  The government appealed to \nthe D.C. Circuit and filed a motion to stay this Court’s order to \nrestore  the  grantees’  fiscal  year  2025  grants. \nSee Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, at *2. \nA motions panel of the D.C. Circuit granted the government’s \nmotion for a stay, finding that this Court likely lacked jurisdiction \nto restore the grants. See Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, \nat *1, 3.  Relying on the Supreme Court’s opinion in Department of \nEducation, [145 S. Ct. 966 (2025),] the panel majority found that the \ngovernment,  through  its  grant  agreement  with  the  plaintiffs, \n“promised  to  pay  the  appropriated  funds”  and  “[i]n  return, \n[plaintiffs] promised to use the funds to advance statutory objectives \nand to comply with all program requirements.”  Id. at *3.  “These \nexchanges of promises—reflecting offer, acceptance, consideration, \nmutuality of intent, and action by an official with authority to bind \nthe government—constitute government contracts for Tucker Act \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 16 of 42\npurposes.”  Id. (citing Columbus Reg’l Hosp. v. United States, \n990 F.3d [1330, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2021)]).  The panel majority \nheld  that  “[w]hether  phrased  as  a  declaration  that  [the  grant] \nagreements  remain  in  force,  or  an  order  to  pay  the  money \ncommitted by  those  agreements,”  this  Court’s  injunction  “in \nsubstance order[ed] specific performance of the grant agreements—\na  quintessentially  contractual  remedy.”    Id.  at  *4.    The  panel \nmajority concluded that the “inherently contractual nature” of the \ndistrict court’s relief “makes the [Court of Federal Claims] the \nexclusive forum for this suit.”  Id. \nSouthern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *9-10.  In Southern Educ., this Court respectfully \ndeclined to follow the panel majority’s holding in Widakuswara II, largely for the reasons \narticulated in Judge Pillard’s dissent.  See Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, at *12 \n(Pillard, J., dissenting) (“[w]hat matters is what the court must examine to resolve the case:  If a \nplaintiff’s claim depends on interpretations of statutes and regulations rather than the terms of an \nagreement negotiated by the parties, the claim is not in essence contractual.”); Southern \nEduc., 2025 WL 1453047, at *10 (adopting Judge Pillard’s reasoning). \nThe plaintiffs in Widakuswara II quickly filed petitions for rehearing en banc.  \nSee Widakuswara Plaintiffs-Appellees’ Pet. for Rehearing En Banc, Dkt. Nos. 25-5144, 25-5145 \n(D.C. Cir. May 5, 2025); Plaintiffs’ Emergency Pet. for Rehearing En Banc, Dkt. \nNos. 25-5150, 25-5151 (D.C. Cir. May 5, 2025).  The D.C. Circuit, en banc, administratively \nstayed the motion panel’s stay order “pending further order of the court,” with four judges \ndissenting.  See Middle East Broad. Networks, Inc. v. United States, No. 25-5150, 2025 \nWL 1378735, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 7, 2025).  Then, on May 28, 2025, the en banc court denied \nin part and granted in part plaintiffs’ petitions for reconsideration; the same four judges again \ndissented.  See Widakuswara v. Lake (“Widakuswara En Banc Order”), No. 25-5144, 2025 \nWL 1521355, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 28, 2025).  Relevant here is the Circuit’s decision to \nreconsider the portion of the panel’s decision which found that the district court likely lacked \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 17 of 42\njurisdiction under the Tucker Act to order the reinstatement of plaintiffs’ federal grants.  \nSee Widakuswara En Banc Order, 2025 WL 1521355, at *1.  The majority stated that, \n“substantially for the reasons explained by Judge Pillard” in her Widakuswara II dissent, the \ngovernment “ha[d] not made the requisite ‘strong showing’ of a likelihood of success on the \nmerits” of its claims, including its Tucker Act jurisdictional arguments.  See id. \n    To date, the D.C. Circuit has not yet reheard the Widakuswara cases en banc on \nthe merits.  Absent an intervening change in controlling law, the Court sees no reason to deviate \nfrom its analysis in its Southern Educ. opinion regarding the Tucker Act jurisdictional question.   \n \n                 B. Ripeness \n \nDefendants’ second jurisdictional argument is that plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe \nbecause MAEC filed an administrative appeal challenging the grant termination.  See Defs. \nOpp. at 10-11.  But as the Court said in Southern Educ., the withdrawal of an administrative \nappeal and the filing of an amended complaint reflecting that withdrawal—especially when, as \nhere, the plaintiff is not statutorily required to exhaust all available administrative remedies—\nresolves “any risk of a concurrent administrative process that might preclude judicial \nreview.”  2025 WL 1453047, at *11; see also Scahill v. D.C., 909 F.3d 1177, 1184 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018) (holding that a plaintiff may cure jurisdictional defects by filing an amended \npleading, thereby avoiding “the unnecessary hassle and expense of filing a new lawsuit when \nevents subsequent to filing the original complaint have fixed the jurisdictional problem.”).     \nMAEC withdrew its administrative appeal on July 2, 2025.  Am. Compl. ¶ 114.  \nThen, on July 7, 2025, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reflecting the withdrawal of \nMAEC’s administrative appeal.  See id.  The Court therefore finds that these developments \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 18 of 42\nresolve any risk of a concurrent administrative process that might preclude judicial review, and \nrender defendants’ ripeness argument moot.  See Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *11.   \n                    \nC.  Article III Standing \nDefendants’ third and final jurisdictional argument relates only to the NAACP \nPlaintiffs.  Defendants argue that they lack associational standing to sue on behalf of their \nmembers because their members’ alleged harms are “far too attenuated” to give rise to standing.  \nSecond Defs. Suppl. at 3; see also Defs. Opp. at 13.  On the current record, the Court agrees, and \ntherefore will not now consider the NAACP Plaintiffs’ claims.  It need not do so because the \nother plaintiff in this case, MAEC, likely does have standing to sue.  See infra at 19-20. \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  See Murthy v. Missouri, 603 \nU.S. 43, 56-57 (2024); U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  For a plaintiff’s claims to come within this \nCourt’s limited subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff must have standing to advance their \nclaims.  See Attias v. Carefirst, Inc., 865 F.3d 620, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  To establish standing, \na plaintiff must demonstrate that they have suffered an “injury in fact” that is “concrete and \nparticularized,” “actual or imminent,” “fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the \ndefendant,” and which “likely” will be “redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992) (alterations in original) (first quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 \nU.S. 737, 756 (1984); then quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990); and then \nquoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976)).   \nA plaintiff must have standing “for each claim that [it] press[es] and for each form \nof relief that [it] seek[s].”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021).  And for a \nplaintiff to have standing to pursue “forward-looking” relief—such as an injunction—the \nplaintiff must “face ‘a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.’”  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 19 of 42\nU.S. at 58 (quoting O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 496 (1974)).  At the preliminary \ninjunction stage, the movant bears the burden of demonstrating a “substantial likelihood” of \nstanding.  Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nHere, all plaintiffs are organizational plaintiffs.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 14-16.  “An \norganizational plaintiff can demonstrate standing either by organizational standing, showing \ninjury to itself, or by associational standing, showing ‘a cognizable injury to one or more of its \nmembers.’”  Nat’l Ass’n of Consumer Advocs. v. RentGrow, Inc. (“NACA v. RentGrow”), Civil \nAction No. 24-3218 (PLF), 2025 WL 1429172, at *2 (D.D.C. May 16, 2025) (quoting \nKingman v. Park Civic Ass’n v. Bowser, 815 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2016)).  MAEC asserts \norganizational standing, and the NAACP Plaintiffs assert associational standing.  Pls. Mot. at 1. \n \n1.  Plaintiff MAEC’s Organizational Standing \nThe Court finds—and the parties do not dispute—that MAEC has sufficiently \ndemonstrated organizational standing to sue on its own behalf.  See Pls. Mot. at 1, 12.  To have \nstanding to sue “in its own right,” an organization must show that it has suffered “an actual or \nthreatened injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and \nlikely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.”  League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. \nExec. Off. of the President (“LULAC”), Civil Action No. 25-0946 (CKK), 2025 WL 1187730, \nat *22 (D.D.C. Apr. 24, 2025) (quoting Am. Anti-Vivisection Soc’y v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 946 \nF.3d 615, 618 (D.C. Cir. 2020)).  MAEC alleges that the Department’s decision to terminate its \nEAC grant violates its First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights, as well as the APA.  See \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 202-80.  MAEC also alleges economic and reputational harms as a result of the \nDepartment’s termination decision.  See Pls. Mot. at 12.  The Court finds that MAEC’s alleged \ninjuries constitute injuries in fact that are fairly traceable to defendants’ allegedly unlawful \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 20 of 42\ntermination decision, and that are likely to be redressed by a favorable decision from this Court, \nspecifically, an order setting aside as unlawful the Department’s termination of MAEC’s grant. \n \n2.  The NAACP Plaintiffs’ Associational Standing \nAs for the NAACP Plaintiffs, the Court finds that they have not sufficiently \ndemonstrated associational standing to sue on their members’ behalf.  Accordingly, the Court \nwill deny the NAACP Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction for lack of standing. \nTo establish associational standing, an organization must show that “(a) its \nmembers would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests [the \norganization] seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the \nclaim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the \nlawsuit.”  NACA v. RentGrow, 2025 WL 1429172, at *3 (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple \nAdvert. Comm’n (“Hunt”), 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  For an organization to satisfy the first \nprong of the associational standing test, it must show, for each of its claims, that at least one of \nits members suffered an “injury in fact” that is “concrete and particularized,” “actual or \nimminent,” “fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant,” and which “likely” \nwill be “redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61.  When the plaintiff is not \nitself “the object of the government action or inaction [plaintiff] challenges, standing is not \nprecluded, but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.”  Id. at 562 (internal \nquotations omitted); see also Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 20 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  In such cases, \nplaintiff must proffer “substantial evidence of a causal relationship between the government \n[action] and the third-party conduct” to establish standing.  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d at 20 \n(quoting Nat’l Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., 366 F.3d 930, 941 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 21 of 42\nAs discussed, the NAACP Plaintiffs allege that defendants’ termination of the \nEAC program—that is, all four of the EAC grants—violates their members’ First Amendment \nand Fifth Amendment rights, and violates the APA.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 202-28, 235-89.  The \nNAACP Plaintiffs’ declarations establish the following facts:  (i) NAACP members attend \nschools or have children who attend schools that were provided services through the EAC \nprogram prior to the Department’s termination of the EAC grants, see Lewis Decl. ¶ 14; (ii) one \nNAACP member believes their child “would benefit from programs designed to help \n[the child’s] school reduce disparities” in access to educational resources, see Simelton Decl. \n¶ 16; (iii) one NAACP member believes their child would benefit from services designed to \nreduce racial disparities in access to advanced classes, see Leconte Decl. ¶ 11; (iv) one NAACP \neducator member, Ms. Civil Miller-Watkins, intended to attend future training sessions offered \nby her school district “through its partnership with EAC-South,” but because EAC-South \n“significantly scale[d] back the services” it provided to Ms. Miller-Watkins’s school district after \nits grant was terminated, Ms. Miller-Watkins “can no longer receive that training,” see Holmes \nDecl. ¶ 20; and (v) two EACs— the Midwest and Plains Equity Assistance Center and the \nWestern Educational Equity Assistance Center—discontinued ongoing projects with school \ndistricts and LEAs located in Region III and Region IV, respectively, after the Department \nterminated their EAC grants.  See Mundry Decl. ¶¶ 7-18; Skelton Decl. ¶¶ 6-12.  \nThe Court concludes that these declarations are not sufficient to demonstrate that \nat least one of the NAACP Plaintiffs’ members “have standing to sue in their own right.”  See \nHunt, 432 U.S. at 343.  Because the NAACP Plaintiffs’ members are not themselves “the object \nof the government action or inaction” that plaintiffs challenge—the Department’s termination of \nthe EAC grants—the NAACP Plaintiffs bore the burden of providing “substantial evidence of a \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 22 of 42\ncausal relationship” between defendants’ termination of the EAC grants and their members’ \nalleged harms.  See Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d at 20; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  But the proffered \ndeclarations merely establish that NAACP members have benefitted, see Lewis Decl. ¶ 14, might \nbenefit, see Simelton Decl. ¶ 16; Leconte Decl. ¶ 11, or intended to benefit from the EAC \nprogram at some unspecified point in the future.  See Holmes Decl. ¶ 20.5  The “causal \nconnection” between these alleged injuries and defendants’ termination decision is far too \nattenuated to be “fairly . . . trace[able]” to defendants’ conduct.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.   \nConsider the “chain of contingencies” between the Department’s termination \ndecision and the harms alleged by the NAACP Plaintiffs’ members.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l \nUSA (“Clapper”), 568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013).  On February 13, 2025, the Department terminated \nall four EAC grants.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 86.  The grant terminations allegedly led MAEC and \nthe other EAC grantees to “abruptly end” some ongoing technical assistance projects with school \ndistricts and LEAs.  Pls. Mot. at 35-36; see also Mundry Decl. ¶¶ 7-18; Skelton Decl. ¶¶ 6-12.  \nThis, in turn, left some school districts and LEAs without the EACs’ technical assistance \nservices.  See Lewis Decl. ¶ 14.  If those school districts and LEAs are unable to obtain \ncomparable services from other sources, then their ability to “address patterns of discrimination \nand hostile environments” may eventually be negatively impacted.  Pls. Mot. at 36.  And if that \nhappens, educators and students—including the NAACP Plaintiffs’ members—may eventually \nbe impacted by discrimination or other negative outcomes.  See Lewis Decl. ¶ 14; Simelton Decl. \n¶ 16; Leconte Decl. ¶ 11; Holmes Decl. ¶ 20.  But this “theory of future injury is too speculative \nto satisfy the well-established requirement that threatened injury must be “certainly impending” \n \n  5  The Mundry and Skelton declarations do not allege harms to the NAACP \nPlaintiffs’ members at all.  See Mundry Decl. ¶¶ 7-18; Skelton Decl. ¶¶ 6-12. \n  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 23 of 42\nto constitute an injury in fact.  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 400 (citing Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. \nat 158); see also Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 496 (2009) (rejecting a standing \ntheory premised on a speculative chain of possibilities); Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d at 20-21. \nThe NAACP Plaintiffs’ theory of standing suffers from another defect:  it requires \ntoo much “guesswork as to how independent decisionmakers”—specifically, the EACs, school \ndistricts, and LEAs—“will exercise their judgment.”  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. at 57-58.  \nRecall that EACs do not supply technical assistance services directly to students or educators.  \nSee Williams Decl. ¶ 3.  Rather, the EACs’ services “are available only upon request by eligible \npublic-school institutions” in an assigned region, who in turn distribute the benefits of the EACs’ \nservices to students and educators in that region.  Id.  Thus, there are two degrees of separation—\nand two independent decisionmakers—between defendants and the NAACP Plaintiffs’ members.  \nThe Court cannot engage in “guesswork as to how [those] independent decisionmakers” will \nexercise their judgment in the wake of defendants’ termination decisions.  See NAACP v. U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., Civil Action No. 25-1120 (DLF), 2025 WL 1196212, at *3 (D.D.C. \nApr. 24, 2025) (finding that the NAACP’s theory of associational standing “relie[d] too much on \nguesswork” where its members’ alleged injuries “stem[med] from the independent decisions of \nschool boards and administrators to end certain programs implicating DEI.”); see also ASARCO \nInc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 615 (1989) (explaining that plaintiff’s theory of standing may not \ndepend on “unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose \nexercise of . . . discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict.”). \nThe attenuated nature of the NAACP Plaintiffs’ theory of standing applies equally \nto each of their claims.  See Pls. Mot. at 17-18 (basing associational standing to advance \nFirst Amendment claim on allegations that the Department’s termination of SEF’s EAC-South \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 24 of 42\ngrant led to a disruption in EAC-South’s programming, which led to an NAACP member “no \nlonger be[ing] able” to attend a not-yet-scheduled training that she “intended to attend.”); id. \nat 20 (basing associational standing to advance Fifth Amendment claim on allegations that the \nDepartment’s termination of SEF’s EAC-South grant—using an allegedly vague termination \nletter—led to EAC-South “no longer ha[ving] the financial resources to continue providing” \ntechnical assistance trainings to a particular school district, which in turn deprived an NAACP \nmember of the opportunity to attend future trainings); id. at 35-36 (basing associational standing \nto advance APA claims on allegations that defendants failed to consider the reliance interests of \nNAACP members whose children experience disparities in access to educational resources, and \nwho would have benefitted from technical assistance that may have remedied those disparities). \nThus—at least at this stage of the litigation—the Court cannot conclude that the \nNAACP Plaintiffs have shown a “substantial likelihood” of demonstrating standing.  See Food & \nWater Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d at 913.  And even assuming, arguendo, that the NAACP \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated associational standing to sue on behalf of their members, they have \nnot sufficiently demonstrated that their members’ alleged harms constitute irreparable harm such \nthat a preliminary injunction is warranted.  See infra at Section III.C.1.  Accordingly, the Court \nwill deny the NAACP Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction for lack of standing.   \nBy contrast, because MAEC has shown a “substantial likelihood” of \ndemonstrating organizational standing, see supra at Section II.C.1, the Court will allow MAEC’s \nmotion for a preliminary injunction to proceed.  But MAEC conceded at oral argument that it \nonly has standing to challenge defendants’ termination of MAEC’s grant, not all four EAC \ngrants.  See Transcript of Record, Mid-Atlantic Equity Consortium v. U.S. Dep’t of Education, \nCivil Action No. 25-1407 (July 8, 2025) at 6:19-22 (“What plaintiff MAEC is seeking is the \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 25 of 42\nset[ting] aside and restoration of its EAC grant and not of the other [EAC grants], nor are we \nclaiming that plaintiff MAEC has standing to challenge those terminations.”).  The Court \ntherefore will consider MAEC’s claims only as they relate to the termination of MAEC’s grant. \n \nIII.  MAEC’S REQUEST FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n        A.  Legal Standard \nA movant seeking preliminary injunctive relief must make a “clear showing that \nfour factors, taken together, warrant relief:  likely success on the merits, likely irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief, a balance of the equities in its favor, and accord with the \npublic interest.”  Archdiocese of Washington v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth. (“Archdiocese \nof Washington”), 897 F.3d 314, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting League of Women Voters v. \nNewby 838 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016)); see also Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (noting that a preliminary injunction “may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc. (“Winter”), 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008))).  Of these, the most important factor is whether \nthe movant has established a likelihood of success on the merits.  See Aamer v. Obama, 742 \nF.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see also Bailey v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Civil Action \nNo. 24-1219 (PLF), 2024 WL 3219207, at *3 (D.D.C. June 28, 2024). \nBefore the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, courts in this Circuit weighed \nthese four factors on a “sliding scale,” under which the movant need not “make as strong a \nshowing” on one factor if they “make[ ] an unusually strong showing” on another.  Davis v. \nPension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1291-92 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Davenport v. \nInt’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 361 (D.C. Cir. 1999)); accord Damus v. Nielsen, 313 F. \nSupp. 3d 317, 326 (D.D.C. 2018).  This Circuit has suggested, however, that “a likelihood of \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 26 of 42\nsuccess” and “a likelihood of irreparable harm” are “independent, free-standing requirement[s] \nfor a preliminary injunction.”  Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d at 392-93 (quoting Davis v. Pension \nBenefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d at 1296 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring)); see Archdiocese of \nWashington, 897 F.3d at 334 (declining to resolve whether the “sliding scale” approach is still \nvalid after Winter); Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Vought, Civil Action No. 25-0381 \n(ABJ), 2025 WL 942772, at *19 (D.D.C. Mar. 28, 2025).  Regardless, “a failure to show a \nlikelihood of success on the merits alone is sufficient to defeat a preliminary-injunction motion.”  \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 205 F. Supp. 3d 4, 26 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(citing Ark. Dairy Coop. Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 573 F.3d 815, 832 (D.C. Cir. 2009)); \nsee also M.G.U. v. Nielsen, 325 F. Supp. 3d 111, 117-18 (D.D.C. 2018). \nFor each of its claims, MAEC bears the burden of persuasion.  Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  MAEC also “bears the burden \nof producing credible evidence sufficient to demonstrate [its] entitlement to injunctive relief.”  \nWorkman v. Bissessar, 275 F. Supp. 3d 263, 267 (D.D.C. 2017).     \n \n               B.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nMAEC contends that it is likely to succeed on the merits of all of its claims:  its \nFifth Amendment claims (Counts One and Three), its First Amendment claims (Count Two), and \nits APA claims (Counts Four, Five, Six, and Seven).  The Court finds that MAEC is likely to \nsucceed on the merits of Count Five—that the Department’s termination of MAEC’s EAC grant \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 27 of 42\nwas arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  The Court therefore will grant plaintiffs’ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction only as it relates to MAEC.6 \n \n                                           1.  Finality  \nThe APA limits judicial review to “final agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Agency \naction is “final” when two conditions are met: (1) “the action must mark the ‘consummation’ of \nthe agency’s decision making process—it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory \nnature,” and (2) “the action must be one by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,’ \nor from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) \n(quoting Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948), and \nPort of Boston Marine Terminal Ass’n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatl., 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970)).   \nHere, MAEC challenges three “final” agency actions:  (i) the Department’s \n“termination of . . . MAEC’s grant,” (ii) “the unlawful adoption of new grant appeals \nprocedures,” and (iii) “the unlawful adoption of new agency priorities.”  Pls. Mot. at 25.   \nThe Court concludes that the Department’s termination of MAEC’s EAC grant is \na final agency action such that it is subject to judicial review under the APA.  MAEC received a \nform termination letter from the Department that was identical to the letter SEF received in \nSouthern Educ.  Compare Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *3-4, with Termination Letter.   \nIn Southern Educ., this Court found that the termination letter SEF received from the Department \nrepresented that the Department had concluded its review of the EAC-South grant.  See Southern \n \n  6  Although the parties briefed multiple issues, the Court need only find that MAEC \nis likely to succeed on one of its claims for this factor to weigh in its favor.  The Court therefore \ndoes not address all of the parties’ arguments at this preliminary stage.  See Media Matters for \nAm. v. Paxton, 732 F. Supp. 3d 1, 27 (D.D.C. 2024), affirmed, No. 24-7059, 2025 WL 492257 \n(D.C. Cir. Feb. 13, 2025). \n \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 28 of 42\nEduc., 2025 WL 1453047, at *15.  The termination of the EAC-South grant “was immediate, \nwithout prior notice of deficiencies or opportunity to respond, [and] immediately produced legal \nconsequences for SEF because SEF could no longer access previously awarded funds.”  Id.  And \nthough SEF administratively appealed the Department’s termination decision, SEF withdrew its \nadministrative appeal and filed an amended complaint to reflect that it had withdrawn its appeal.  \nSee id.  The Court found that “[those] factual developments resolve[d] any risk of a concurrent \nadministrative process altering the Court’s analysis or obviating judicial review.”  Id. (citing \nVanda Pharms. Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., Civil Action No. 23-2812 (CRC), 2024 \nWL 4133623, at *8 (D.D.C. Sept. 10, 2024) (emphasizing that what “matters” when determining \nwhether a claim is incurably premature is if a “separate, still pending [administrative] \nproceeding . . . might alter the court’s analysis or entirely vitiate the need for judicial review.”)).   \nFor the reasons it articulated in Southern Educ., the Court finds that the \nDepartment’s termination of MAEC’s EAC grant constituted final agency action. \n \n                               2.  Arbitrary and Capricious    \nFor the same reasons that SEF prevailed in showing that the Department’s \ntermination of the EAC-South grant was arbitrary and capricious in Southern Educ., the Court \nconcludes that MAEC likely will prevail in showing that the Department’s termination of \nMAEC’s EAC grant was arbitrary and capricious in this case.  See Southern Educ., 2025 \nWL 1453047, at *16-17.   \nThe APA instructs reviewing courts to hold unlawful and set aside final agency \nactions found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  When assessing whether a final agency action is “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” courts consider \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 29 of 42\n“only whether the [agency] examined ‘the relevant data’ and articulated ‘a satisfactory \nexplanation’ for [its] decision, ‘including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.’”  Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 (2019) (quoting Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. (“Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Assn.”), 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)); see also FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 \nU.S. 414, 423 (2021) (explaining that an agency action is “arbitrary” and “capricious” if it is not \n“reasonable and reasonably explained.”); Nat’l Tel. Coop. Ass’n v. FCC, 563 F.3d 536, 540 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (“The APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency rules be \nreasonable and reasonably explained.”).  “The scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and \ncapricious’ standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the \nagency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U.S. at 30.   \nIn determining whether the Department’s termination of MAEC’s EAC grant was \n“reasonable and reasonably explained,” the Court looks first to the “grounds that the \n[Department] invoked” when it terminated the grant.  Michigan v. EPA, 576 \nU.S. 743, 758 (2015)); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U.S. at 50 (“. . . an agency’s \naction must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.”).  Recall that the \nTermination Letter that the Department sent to MAEC on February 13, 2025 reads as follows: \nThis letter provides notice that the United States Department of \nEducation is terminating your federal award, S004D220002.  See 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340-43; see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.253.  \nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates.  The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment’s grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 30 of 42\nprotected characteristic.   Illegal  DEI policies  and practices can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education.  In addition to complying with the civil \nrights laws, it is vital that the Department assess whether all grant \npayments are free from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to \nassess  whether  current  grants  are  in  the  best  interests  of  the \nUnited States.  \nThe  grant  specified  above  provides  funding  for  programs  that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that \nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nnational  origin,  or  another  protected  characteristic;  that  violate \neither the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict \nwith the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and \nexcellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the \nUnited States.  The grant is therefore inconsistent with, and no \nlonger  effectuates,  Department  priorities.  See  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4); see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.253.  Therefore, pursuant \nto,  among  other  authorities,  2  C.F.R.  §  200.339-43,  34  C.F.R. \n§ 75.253, and the termination provisions in your grant award, the \nDepartment  hereby  terminates  grant  No.  S004D220002  in  its \nentirety effective 2/13/25. \nTermination Letter at 1.  The Termination Letter lists five theoretical bases for the termination of \nMAEC’s grant.  See Shaffer Decl. App., Ex. A at 1.  The Termination Letter states that MAEC’s \ngrant may have been terminated because it “promote[s] or take[s] part in DEI initiatives” that \n“unlawfully discriminate on the basis of” protected characteristics, or “violate either the letter or \npurpose of Federal civil rights law,” or “conflict with” the Department’s policies, or “are not free \nfrom fraud, abuse, or duplication,” or “otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United \nStates.”  See id.  The Termination Letter does not identify which of these bases was the reason \nfor the termination of MAEC’s grant.  In fact, the Termination Letter was one of many \nstandardized termination letters that the Department sent to many federal grant recipients in early \nFebruary 2025.  See Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *3-4; see also California v. U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., Civil Action No. 25-10548 (MJJ), 2025 WL 760825, *2-3 (D. Mass. \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 31 of 42\nMar. 10, 2025); Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, Civil Action No. 25-0702 \n(JRR), 2025 WL 833917, at *17 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025).   \nAs noted, the Supreme Court has held that a reasonable explanation must consider \nrelevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for the agency’s decision, “including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Dep’t of Commerce v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. at 773 (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U.S. at 43).  “Here, ‘[t]he \nDepartment has not provided a satisfactory explanation of the facts found or the choice made, \nmuch less a rational connection between the two.’”  Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *16 \n(quoting Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 833917, at *21).  There \nis no evidence in the record that the Department engaged in any individualized assessment of \nCEE’s programming, or collected or considered any relevant data about MAEC or the CEE \nbefore terminating the grant.  “And the Department’s use of a boilerplate letter that was issued to \nseveral other grant recipients further strengthens [MAEC’s] argument that there was no rational \nconnection between the facts the Department found, if any, and the termination decision that it \nmade.”  Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *16; see also id. (finding that defendants’ \ntermination of the EAC-South grant using a standardized termination letter was arbitrary and \ncapricious under the APA); Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, 2025 \nWL 833917, at *21 (finding that an identical termination letter “fail[ed] to provide Grant \nRecipients any workable, sensible, or meaningful reason or basis for the termination of their \nawards.”); Thakur v. Trump, Civil Action No. 25-04737 (RFL), 2025 WL 1734471, at *14 (N.D. \nCal. June 23, 2025) (finding that the “pace of the review” of plaintiffs’ federal grants and “the \nresulting large waves of [grant] terminations via form letters . . . further suggests a likelihood \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 32 of 42\nthat no APA-compliant individualized review occurred,” raising “precisely the kinds of concerns \nthat the APA’s bar on arbitrary-and-capricious agency decisionmaking was meant to address.”). \nThe Court concludes that the Department’s Termination Letter provides no \nreasoned explanation for the grant termination.  “In fact, the Termination Letter’s list of possible \nbases ‘is so broad and vague as to be limitless; devoid of import, even.’”  Southern Educ., 2025 \nWL 1453047, at *17 (quoting Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, 2025 \nWL 833917, at *21).  Moreover, the Termination Letter’s reliance on undefined terms like \n“DEI” and “Illegal DEI” is also “arbitrary and capricious because it allows [defendants] to arrive \nat whatever conclusion [they] wish[ ] without adequately explaining the standard on which \n[their] decision is based.”  Am. Pub. Health Ass’n v. Nat’l Institutes of Health, Civil Action \nNo. 25-10787 (WGY), 2025 WL 1822487, at *17 (D. Mass. July 2, 2025) (quoting Firearms \nRegul. Accountability Coal., Inc. v. Garland, 112 F.4th 507, 525 (8th Cir. 2024).   \nFor those reasons, the Court finds that MAEC has shown a substantial likelihood \nof success on the merits of Count Five—the APA arbitrary and capricious claim.  \n \n               C.  Irreparable Harm \n    Turning next to irreparable harm, plaintiffs assert that they will face “actual,” \n“certain,” and “imminent” injuries that “independently amount[ ] to irreparable harm.”  Pls. Mot \nat 39-44.  To constitute irreparable harm, plaintiffs’ alleged injuries must be “both certain and \ngreat,” “actual and not theoretical,” and “beyond remediation.”  Brennan Ctr. for Just. at NYU \nSch. of L. v. Dep’t of Com., 498 F. Supp. 3d 87, 101 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297).  While economic injuries are usually insufficient to justify \ninjunctive relief, financial harm can “constitute irreparable harm . . . where the loss threatens the \nvery existence of the movant’s business.”  Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 33 of 42\nCir. 1985).  And “obstacles [that] unquestionably make it more difficult for the [plaintiff] to \naccomplish [its] primary mission . . . provide injury for purposes . . . [of establishing] irreparable \nharm.”  League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d at 9.  Reputational injury can also suffice \nto establish irreparable harm.  See Patriot, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 963 F. \nSupp. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1997) (finding plaintiffs’ business reputation would be damaged by agency’s \ncharacterization of them as “enticing” senior citizens into meetings, and “pressuring” them to \nobtain reverse mortgages “under the guise of sound estate planning.”). \n    The Court finds that the NAACP Plaintiffs have not sufficiently shown that their \nmembers will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  The Court \nfinds, however, that MAEC has sufficiently made such a showing on its own behalf.   \n   \n1.  The NAACP Plaintiffs’ Theories of Irreparable Harm \n    The NAACP Plaintiffs advance two theories of irreparable harm:  (i) the \ndeprivation of their members’ First and Fifth Amendment rights, and (ii) the broader harms that \nwill result “from the denial of technical assistance services to redress persistent racial \ndiscrimination in the schools” that NAACP members “attend and work in.”  Pls. Mot. at 43.  \nSpecifically, the NAACP Plaintiffs assert that “[t]he loss of technical assistance to remedy racial \ndiscrimination in schools will occasion profound harms to the well-being of NAACP members \nand other Black students” because “[s]chool-based racial discrimination harms students’ \nmotivation, academic performance, graduation rates, and physical and mental health.”  Id. \n    Starting with the NAACP Plaintiffs’ latter theory of irreparable harm, the Court \ndoes not question the harmful effects that discrimination can have on students of color, \nespecially in the classroom.  But the issue before this Court is not the legitimacy of those \nharms—it is whether the NAACP Plaintiffs have provided substantial evidence of a “causal \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 34 of 42\nconnection” between defendants’ conduct and the alleged harms facing their members.  See \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  And as the Court has explained, the “causal connection” between the \ndefendants’ decision to terminate the four EAC grants and the alleged injuries suffered by the \nNAACP Plaintiffs’ members is too attenuated to be “fairly . . . trace[able]” to defendants’ \nconduct.  Id.; see supra at Section II.C.2.  In its discussion of associational standing, the Court \nfound the NAACP Plaintiffs’ “theory of future injury . . . too speculative to satisfy the \nwell-established requirement that threatened injury must be “certainly impending” to constitute \nan injury in fact.  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 400; see supra at Section II.C.2.  And in order to \nconstitute irreparable harm, the alleged harms facing the NAACP Plaintiffs’ members must clear \nan even higher threshold.  See Brennan Ctr. for Just. at NYU Sch. of L. v. Dep’t of Com., 498 F. \nSupp. 3d at 101 (explaining that plaintiffs’ alleged injuries must be “both certain and great,” \n“actual and not theoretical,” and “beyond remediation.” (emphasis added)).  The Court concludes \nthat the NAACP Plaintiffs’ second theory of irreparable harm—which amounts to concerns \nabout discrimination that may eventually occur as a result of defendants’ decision to terminate \nthe EAC grants—is likely too attenuated to constitute irreparable harm. \n    As for the NAACP Plaintiffs’ first theory of irreparable harm, the Court finds that \ntheir constitutional claims also do not support their request for preliminary injunctive relief.  The \nNAACP Plaintiffs assert that “the Termination Letter and the termination of the EAC program \nharms [their] members’ First Amendment right to receive information, including by infringing \nupon that right with vague conditions prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.”  Pls. Mot. at 42.  \nWhile the D.C. Circuit has held that “the loss of constitutional freedoms, ‘for even minimal \nperiods of time,’” constitutes per se irreparable harm, Mills v. District of Columbia, 571 \nF.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)), the Court \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 35 of 42\nconcludes that the NAACP Plaintiffs have not sufficiently demonstrated that their members’ \nFirst Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights have been infringed by defendants. \n    To start, the First Amendment protects both the right to speak and the “right to \nreceive information and ideas.”  Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969); see also \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. at 75.  For example, in Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 \nU.S. 141 (1943), the Supreme Court struck down a city’s prohibition on door-to-door distribution \nof “handbills, circulars[,] or other advertisements,” holding that the law violated the \nFirst Amendment based on an individual’s “right to distribute literature,” and another’s “right to \nreceive it.”  Id. at 142-43; see also Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 538 (1945) (holding that a \ncourt could not bar a union organizer from delivering a speech to company employees); \nLamont v. Postmaster Gen. of U.S., 381 U.S. 301, 306-07 (1965) (holding that the government \ncould not burden someone’s right to receive political literature through the mail); id. at 308 \n(Brennan, J., concurring) (“The dissemination of ideas can accomplish nothing if otherwise \nwilling addressees are not free to receive and consider them.”); Little v. Llano Cnty., 138 \nF.4th 834, 842-44 (5th Cir. 2025) (collecting cases).  In other words, the government cannot “bar \nsomeone from receiving someone else’s speech.”  Id. at 842.  So “[t]o assert a First Amendment \nright-to-receive claim, a plaintiff must specifically identify information it is denied access to by \nreason of a government action.”  NAACP v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Civil Action No. 25-1120 \n(DLF), 2025 WL 1196212, at *2 (D.D.C. Apr. 24, 2025) (emphasis added).   \n    Here, the NAACP Plaintiffs allege that the Department’s termination of the \nEAC-South grant forced EAC-South to halt its programming, depriving at least one NAACP \neducator member of the opportunity to attend a future training hosted by their school district in \npartnership with EAC-South.  See Pls. Mot. at 17-18.  But this argument stretches the First \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 36 of 42\nAmendment right to receive too far:  defendants’ decision to terminate the EAC-South grant has \nnot prevented the NAACP Plaintiffs’ members from receiving information from EAC-South.  \nSee Little v. Llano Cnty., 138 F.4th at 843.  Rather, defendants have simply chosen not to \ncontinue paying EAC-South to disseminate information.  See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 200 \n(1991) (“[T]he Government may choose not to subsidize speech”); see also Rosenberger v. \nRector & Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995); Regan v. Taxation With \nRepresentation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540, 546 (1983) (“We again reject the notion that First \nAmendment rights are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized by the State.”).  \nThe NAACP Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim therefore is not likely to succeed on the merits.  \n    This conclusion also is fatal to the NAACP Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment due \nprocess void-for-vagueness claim.  Void-for-vagueness challenges under the Fifth Amendment \nare essentially due process claims, which means that the NAACP Plaintiffs must establish the \ndeprivation of a protected interest in liberty or property to succeed on their Fifth Amendment \nclaim.  See NB ex rel. Peacock v. District of Columbia, 794 F.3d 31, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“The \nfirst inquiry in every due process challenge is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a \nprotected interest in ‘liberty’ or ‘property.’”); see also Nat’l Urb. League v. Trump, Civil Action \nNo. 25-471 (TJK), 2025 WL 1275613, at *17 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025) (observing that “[a] void for \nvagueness challenge is, at bottom, a due-process claim, so Plaintiffs must show that they were \ndeprived of a constitutionally-protected property or liberty interest.”).  The NAACP Plaintiffs \nargue that “as a direct result of the vague prohibitions imposed on the EACs,” through the \nDepartment’s grant termination letters, the EACs no longer have the financial resources to \ncontinue providing instructional programming to participating school districts, depriving \nNAACP educator members of that valuable information.  Pls. Mot. at 20.  These “vague \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 37 of 42\nprohibitions,” they assert, violate NAACP members’ “liberty interest in continuing to receive \ntraining, instructional materials, and other technical assistance programming” from the EACs.  \nSee Pls. Mot. at 20.   \n    But as discussed, the NAACP Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently demonstrate \nthat defendants have infringed their members’ First Amendment right to receive information \nfrom the EACs.  The NAACP Plaintiffs therefore have not sufficiently demonstrated that their \nmembers were deprived of a constitutionally-protected property or liberty interest, as is required \nfor Fifth Amendment due process claims.  See e.g., Vera Inst. of Just. v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., \n2025 WL 1865160, at *16 (finding that plaintiffs had no “plausible property interest in . . . grant \nawards”); Nat’l Urb. League v. Trump, 2025 WL 1275613, at *19 (same). \n    For these reasons, the Court finds that the NAACP Plaintiffs have not sufficiently \nshown that their members will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.   \n \n2.  Plaintiff MAEC’s Theories of Irreparable Harm \n    The Court finds that MAEC has sufficiently demonstrated that it will suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  MAEC advances three theories of \nirreparable harm: “deprivation of its First and Fifth Amendment rights,” “reputational harm,” \nPls. Mot. at 39, and “economic losses [that] are immediate, concrete, and unrecoverable as \nafter-the-fact monetary damages” in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  Id. at 41-42.  \nMAEC alleges that its terminated EAC grant represents “over forty percent of MAEC’s annual \nrevenue,” Pls. Mot. at 41; see also Rouland Decl. ¶ 36, and the loss of nearly half of its funding \n“threatens [MAEC’s] very existence.”  Pls. Mot. at 42.  MAEC also alleges that after the \nDepartment terminated MAEC’s EAC grant, MAEC was “forced to close its Equity Assistance \nCenter [the CEE],” Pls. Mot. at 11, “terminate intensive technical assistance requested by six \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 38 of 42\nschool districts,” id., “cancel every program and project run by [the] CEE,” id. at 41, “lay off \nfour [CEE] employees, reduce all remaining [CEE] employees to 80% capacity, abandon \n[CEE’s] office space, and cut off [CEE’s] telephone and internet service.”  Id.   \n    Defendants counter that MAEC has not provided any evidence that the loss of its \nEAC grant is an unrecoverable economic loss.  See Defs. Opp. at 11-12 (citing Taylor v. \nResolution Trust Corp., 56 F.3d 1497, 1507 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see also Wis. Gas Co. v. \nFERC, 758 F.2d at 674 (“economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm.”).  \nDefendants assert that “[p]laintiffs provide no evidence regarding the overall harm to MAEC as \nan organization that operates several programs of which the [CEE] is just one.”  Defs. Opp. \nat 12.  And though MAEC asserts that it has had to lay off CEE employees, reduce all remaining \nCEE employees to 80% capacity, abandon CEE’s office space, and cut off CEE’s telephone and \ninternet service, see Pls. Mot. at 41, defendants contend that these losses “say[ ] nothing about \nthe degree of harm to [MAEC], which is what is relevant.”  Defs. Opp. at 12. \n    The Court recently rejected very similar arguments in Southern Educ.  There, the \nCourt found that SEF had sufficiently demonstrated that it would suffer irreparable harm where \nthe termination of its EAC grant “deprived [SEF] of the sole source of funding for EAC-South,” \n“result[ed] in an immediate cessation of program operations and services,” and would eventually \n“result in [a] $3,371,108 overall loss.”  Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *13.  In addition \nto monetary losses, SEF also alleged that the termination of its EAC grant forced it to “shut \ndown EAC-South entirely,” resulting in “the loss of experienced staff,” “interrupt[ing] ongoing \ntechnical assistance projects,” and constituting an “existential threat to what [plaintiff] has \nbuilt.”  Id.  The Court concluded that “because the defendants’ actions threaten[ed] the \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 39 of 42\nlivelihoods of [SEF’s] employees . . . and the very existence of its programs,” SEF had \nsufficiently demonstrated that it would suffer irreparable harm.  Id. at *15.   \n    Here, the termination of MAEC’s grant “result[ed] in an immediate cessation of \n[the CEE’s] operations and services,” “the loss of experienced staff,” and the interruption of \n“ongoing technical assistance projects.”  Southern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *13.  The grant \ntermination also “devastated MAEC’s operations.”  Pls. Mot. at 41.  The Court therefore finds \nthat MAEC has sufficiently demonstrated that it will suffer irreparable harm absent an \ninjunction.  See Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 833917, at *23 \n(finding that plaintiffs whose federal grants were terminated would suffer irreparable harm \nabsent an injunction); Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., Civil Action No. 25-698 \n(TSC), 2025 WL 1131412, at *17 (D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2025) (same). \n \n   D. Equities and the Public Interest \nThe remaining preliminary injunction factors—the balance of the equities and \nassessment of the public interest—weigh in MAEC’s favor.  These factors “merge when, as here, \nthe Government is the opposing party.’”  Singh v. Berger, 56 F.4th 88, 107 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Karem v. Trump, 960 F.3d 656, 668 (D.C. Cir. 2020)).  “[C]ourts must balance the \ncompeting claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or \nwithholding of the requested relief[,] . . . pay[ing] particular regard for the public consequences” \nthat would result in granting the relief sought.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (quotation marks omitted). \nMAEC alleges economic and non-economic injuries that would occur absent a \npreliminary injunction, and argues that “[n]either the government nor the public will suffer a \nlegitimate injury that outweighs [MAEC’s] interest in preliminary relief,” Pls. Mot. at 44, \nbecause defendants have already “appropriated and allocated” funds for the EAC grant program.  \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 40 of 42\nId. at 45.  Therefore, according to MAEC, defendants will incur no additional costs if ordered to \ndisburse the grant funds.  See id.  MAEC further asserts that members of the public have an \ninterest in allowing MAEC’s work through the CEE—which “advance[s] ‘the Nation’s goal of \nequal educational opportunity’”—to continue.  Id. (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1221-1).   \n    Defendants counter that “there are several compelling reasons that weigh against \nan injunction.”  Defs. Opp. at 21.  “First, the government and the public both have a compelling \ninterest in eliminating racial discrimination.”  Id. (citing Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. \nPresident & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 206 (2023)).  Defendants assert that the \nDepartment “should be allowed to end its support for programs that it views as inconsistent with \nits interpretation of ‘the letter and purpose of’ federal civil rights laws.”  Id.  Defendants also \nargue that the Department “would be harmed by a preliminary order to release remaining funds \nunder the terminated grant” because, if MAEC is given access to the grant funds during the \npendency of the case, the Department “will bear all the risk if the Court enters a preliminary \ninjunction.”  Defs. Opp. at 21-22.  Lastly, defendants argue that granting plaintiffs’ requested \npreliminary injunction would defeat “the primary purpose of a preliminary injunction, which ‘is \nto preserve the object of the controversy in its then existing condition—to preserve the status \nquo.’”  Id. at 22 (quoting Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d at 1043).   \n    The Court rejected similar arguments in Southern Educ., finding that defendants’ \narguments “miss[ed] the mark” for the following reasons:  \nUnder Winter, the Court must balance harms that may occur if an \ninjunction  is  erroneously  granted  as  opposed  to  denied.  See \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 24. Defendants assert that they bear the risk of \nfinancial  loss  if  the  Court  erroneously  enters  a  preliminary \ninjunction, but offer no evidence that SEF is unable to pay back \ngrant monies released. As for defendants’ public interest argument, \nany theoretical harms to members of the public who are opposed to \nEAC-South receiving grant funding do not outweigh the alleged \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 41 of 42\nconcrete, irreparable harm in the form of programmatic closures and \nloss of funding that SEF has already experienced. And to the extent \ndefendants  assert  an  interest  in  ending  financial  support  for \nprograms that are “inconsistent” with their interpretation of federal \ncivil rights laws, the Court finds that that they likely pursued an \nunlawful objective in  an unlawful manner.  See TikTok  Inc. v. \nTrump, 490 F. Supp. 3d 73, 85 (D.D.C. 2020) (“[T]he government \n‘cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful \npractice  or  reads  a  statute  as  required.’”)  (quoting  R.I.L-R  v. \nJohnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015)); see also League \nof Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d at 12 (holding that while \n“[t]here  is  generally  no  public  interest  in  the  perpetuation  of \nunlawful agency action,” “there is a substantial public interest ‘in \nhaving governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern \ntheir existence and operation’ ”) (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 \nF.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)). \nSouthern Educ., 2025 WL 1453047, at *17.  Because defendants proffer no reason why the Court \nshould deviate from its reasoning on this point in Southern Educ., the Court applies the same \nanalysis here, and concludes that the balance of the equities and assessment of the public interest \nweighs in favor of granting a preliminary injunction.  Each of the preliminary injunction factors \ntherefore weighs in favor of granting MAEC’s motion.   \n \nIV. SECURITY \nRule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[t]he court may \nissue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security \nin an amount that the [C]ourt considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any \nparty found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(c).  Here, \ndefendants request that the Court require MAEC “to post security in the amount of any taxpayer \nfunds anticipated to be distributed during the pendency of the Court’s order.”  Defs. Opp. at 22.   \nCourts have “broad discretion” in determining “the appropriate amount of an \ninjunction bond, including the discretion to require no bond at all.”  Simms v. D.C., 872 F. \nSupp. 2d 90, 107 (D.D.C. 2012) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).  As the Court \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01407-PLF     Document 41     Filed 07/30/25     Page 42 of 42",
