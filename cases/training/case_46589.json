On Mary 9, 2025, 15 states filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. They named President Donald Trump, the Secretary of the Army, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its Lieutenant General, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and its Vice Chair as Defendants. They challenged Executive Order 14156, which declared a national energy emergency and instructed the Defendants to issue permits and other approvals for energy-related projects on an expedited and emergency basis. The Plaintiff States argued that the executive order commanded federal agencies to disregard the law and their own regulations to fast tack extensive categories of activities that would result in significant environmental damage. They alleged that the executive order, and the agencies' issuing of permits under the order, exceeded the authority of the Executive and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Jamal N. Whitehead.</p>\r\n<p>The court has requested a joint status report and proposed discovery plan from the parties by September 9, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

This case concerns an Executive Order issued on January 20, 2025, EO 14156, \n9  90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (2025), entitled “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” (Executive \n10  Order).2 Despite the fact that U.S. energy production is at an all-time high, and growing, \n11  President  Trump  (the  President)  invoked  authority  under  the  National  Emergencies  Act, \n12  50 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et seq., to declare a national energy “emergency.” As relevant here, based on \n13  that declaration, the Executive Order commands the heads of executive departments and federal \n14  agencies, including the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps), the Department of \n15  Interior (Interior), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), to issue permits \n16  and other approvals necessary for energy-related projects on an expedited and emergency basis.  \n17  2.  The  Executive  Order  is  unlawful,  and  its  commands  that  federal  agencies \n18  disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of \n19  activities  will  result  in  damage  to  waters,  wetlands,  critical  habitat,  historic  and  cultural \n20  resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources.  \n21  3.  The Plaintiff States agree energy production, the infrastructure needed to support \n22  it, and a reliable and affordable supply of electricity are of critical importance to both the States \n23 \n \n24 \n1 Plaintiff People of the State of Michigan is represented by Attorney General Dana Nessel. The Attorney \nGeneral is Michigan’s chief law enforcement officer and is authorized to bring this action on behalf of the People \n25 \nof the State of Michigan pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws § 14.28. \n2 Available at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-\n26 \nemergency/. Attached as Exhibit A.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 3 of 61\n \n1  and the Nation. The invocation of the Nation’s emergency authorities, however, is reserved for \n2  actual emergencies—not changes in Presidential policy.  \n3  4.   And for good reason. The shortcuts inherent in rushing through emergency \n4  processes fundamentally undermine the rights of States. The Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ \n5  1251 et seq., for example, enshrined state rights to protect water quality within their borders. \n6  And such shortcuts, even when properly invoked, irreparably harm the states, their residents, and \n7  their environments. As a result, and for just one example, the Corps’s regulations authorize \n8  “emergency procedures” only when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to \n9  human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic \n10  hardship.  \n11  5.  Indeed, to date, the Corps and other agencies have limited use of emergency \n12  procedures to projects necessary during or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters \n13  like hurricanes, flooding, or the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of \n14  Mexico. But now, prodded onto the shakiest of limbs by the President’s unsupported and \n15  unlawful  Executive  Order,  multiple  federal  agencies  now  seek  to  broadly  employ  these \n16  emergency procedures in non-emergency situations to, among other actions, permit discharges \n17  of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. That unlawful process is facilitated \n18  by other agencies, like the ACHP and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who have themselves \n19  overextended their own emergency procedures to short-change or completely skip critical \n20  environmental review under the Executive Order’s directive. \n21  6.  Unlawfully bypassing proper permitting procedures for hundreds of projects \n22  currently proposed in and around the Nation—and presumably many more in the future—will \n23  result in significant and irreparable harm to state natural and historic resources and the people \n24  and biota that rely on those resources for drinking, farming, recreating, and habitat.  \n25  7.  To prevent these harms to Plaintiff States from rushed review untethered to any \n26  actual emergency, the Court should declare that the Executive Order is unlawful, that the agency \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346(a)(2). The \n6  Court has further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) \n7  and 2202. The Court also has jurisdiction under the judicial-review provisions of the APA. \n8  5 U.S.C. § 702. \n9  9.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). \n10  Defendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. The State of \n11  Washington is a resident of this judicial district and a substantial part of the events or omissions \n12  giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the Seattle Division of the Western District of \n13  Washington. The Corps’s Seattle District, which is currently fast-tracking permitting pursuant \n14  to the Executive Order, is also located within the Seattle Division. \n15  PARTIES \n16  10.  Plaintiff States are sovereign states of the United States of America. Plaintiffs \n17  bring this action in their sovereign and proprietary capacities. As set out below, Defendants’ \n18  actions directly harm the States’ interests, including, but not limited to, environmental and \n19  financial harms that flow from the President’s unlawful declaration of an energy “emergency,” \n20  the  Corps’s  unlawful  implementation  of  the  Executive  Order  under  its  Clean  Water  Act \n21  Section 404 authority, and the ACHP’s unlawful implementation of the Executive Order under \n22  its authority under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), 54 \n23  U.S.C. § 306108. The States also bring this action to protect their quasi-sovereign interests in \n24  the public health, safety, and welfare of their residents, as well as in their waters, natural \n25  resources, environment, and their economies.  \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 6 of 61\n \n1  ALLEGATIONS \n2 \nA.  Relevant Statutory Provisions \n3  The National Emergencies Act \n4  19.  Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act (“NEA”), 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et \n5  seq., in 1976 to create a transparent and accountable procedure for the President’s declaration of \n6  a national emergency. \n7  20.  In  enacting  the  NEA,  Congress  recognized  that  presidents  had  overused \n8  authorities granted by Congress for quick action in situations where Congress lacked adequate \n9  time to act. The primary purpose of the NEA was to prevent the President from exercising \n10  unbounded  authority  to  declare  states  of  emergency  and  continue  them  in  perpetuity. \n11  Accordingly, the NEA terminated then-existing declared emergencies (some having persisted \n12  for decades) and created a new legal framework to cabin the President’s emergency authority.  \n13  21.  Specifically, the NEA was intended to ensure that presidential emergency powers \n14  would “be utilized only when emergencies actually exist.” S. Rep. No. 94-1168, at 2 (1976). \n15  Senator Frank Church, who was instrumental in developing the NEA, testified on legislation that \n16  became the NEA that “the President should not be allowed to invoke emergency authorities or \n17  in any way utilize the provisions of this Act for frivolous or partisan matters, nor for that matter \n18  in cases where important but not ‘essential’ problems are at stake.” Hearing on H.R. 3884 Before \n19  the S. Comm. of Governmental Operations, 94th Cong. 7 (1976). Senator Church further \n20  explained that “[t]he Committee intentionally chose language which would make clear that the \n21  authority of the Act was to be reserved for matters that are ‘essential’ to the protection of the \n22  Constitution and the people.” Id. \n23  22.  Under the NEA, the President may only invoke the emergency powers Congress \n24  has authorized in other federal statutes when there is a national emergency. 50 U.S.C. § 1621(a) \n25  (“With respect to Acts of Congress authorizing the exercise, during the period of a national \n26  emergency, of any special or extraordinary power, the President is authorized to declare such a \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 7 of 61\n \n1  national emergency”). As the Ninth Circuit recognized, the NEA does not enlarge the powers of \n2  the Executive Branch beyond authorities in existing statutes and regulations. Sierra Club v. \n3  Trump, 977 F.3d 853, 864–65 (9th Cir. 2020), vacated on other grounds, Biden v. Sierra Club, \n4  142 S. Ct. 56 (2021).  \n5  23.  The NEA  further requires the President  to specify the statutory emergency \n6  authorities he or she intends to invoke upon declaring a national emergency, and to publish the \n7  proclamation of a national emergency in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress. Id. \n8  “When the President declares a national emergency, no powers or authorities made available by \n9  statute for use in the event of an emergency shall be exercised unless and until the President \n10  specifies the provisions of law under which he proposes that he, or other offices will act. Such \n11  specification may be made either in the declaration of a national emergency, or by one or more \n12  contemporaneous  or  subsequent  executive  orders  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and \n13  transmitted to Congress.” 50 U.S.C.§ 1631. \n14  24.  Congress  has  specifically  authorized  the  use  of  emergency  powers  by  the \n15  Executive Branch upon declaration of a national emergency and has provided the parameters of \n16  such emergency powers in numerous statutes. For example, 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) provides, “[i]n \n17  the event of a declaration. . . by the President of a national emergency in accordance with the \n18  National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et seq.) that requires use of the armed forces, the \n19  Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other provision of law, may undertake military \n20  construction projects.” Similarly, 50 U.S.C. § 1515 provides, “[a]fter [the effective date], the \n21  operation of this section. . . or any portion thereof, may be suspended by the President during \n22  the period of . . . any national emergency declared by Congress or by the President.”  \n23  The Clean Water Act \n24  25.  The Clean  Water Act’s objective is to “restore and maintain the chemical, \n25  physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).  \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 8 of 61\n \n1  26.  To achieve that goal, Clean Water Act Section 301(a), 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a), \n2  prohibits the discharge of any pollutant by any person into waters of the United States unless \n3  that discharge is authorized by a permit issued under, inter alia, Clean Water Act Section 404, \n4  33 U.S.C. § 1344. \n5  27.  Clean Water Act Section 404(a) authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting \n6  through the Chief of Engineers of the Corps, to issue permits to discharge dredged or fill material \n7  into navigable waters at specified disposal sites. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a). \n8  28.  Each disposal site must be specified for each permit through application of and \n9  compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Section 404(b)(1) \n10  Guidelines, 40 C.F.R. Part 230. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(b)(1). \n11  29.  The  Corps  has  promulgated  regulations  governing  its  process  to  review \n12  applications for and issue Clean Water Act Section 404 permits. See generally 33 C.F.R. §§ 320, \n13  323, 325.  \n14  30.  The Corps’s standard procedures for processing a Section 404 permit application \n15  are set out in 33 C.F.R § 325.2(a). For discharges requiring a standard permit (i.e., an individual \n16  permit), the Corps receives a permit application,3 and if/when the application is complete, issues \n17  a public notice of the application soliciting comments from the public, adjacent property owners, \n18  interested groups and individuals, local agencies, state agencies, and federal agencies. The Corps \n19  considers all comments and the applicant’s responses to those comments, if any, and determines \n20  whether the proposed project will require either an Environmental Assessment or, if there are \n21  significant environmental impacts, an Environmental Impact Statement under the National \n22  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). See 33 C.F.R § 325.2(a)(1)–(5). These processes ensure that \n23  the Corps fully considers the project’s environmental impacts and reasonable alternatives before \n24  making a decision.  \n \n25 \n3 The Corps generally recommends a pre-application consultation and makes itself available to advise \npotential applicants of studies or other information foreseeably required for later federal action. See 33 C.F.R. \n26 \n§ 325.1(b) (pre-application consultation for major applications). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The Corps is required to conduct a public interest review, which involves an \n2  extensive evaluation of the “probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, of the proposed \n3  activity  . . .  on  the  public  interest,”  and  careful  weighing  of  the  “reasonably  foreseeable \n4  detriments” against benefits from the project that “reasonably may be expected to accrue.” \n5  33 C.F.R § 320.4(a)(1).  \n6  32.  The Corps’s decision on an application for a Section 404 permit “should reflect \n7  the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources” and must \n8  consider a many factors including “conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental \n9  concerns, [impacts to] wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, \n10  floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and \n11  conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, \n12  considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.” Id. \n13  33.  The Corps’s regulations also reflect the numerous statutory obligations it must \n14  fulfill before issuing a Section 404 permit to ensure the authorized discharge of dredge and/or \n15  fill materials do not undermine the overall goals of the Clean Water Act and comply with other \n16  statutory requirements regarding the protection of environmental and cultural resources. For \n17  example, the Corps must comply with, among other things, NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq., \n18  the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531 et seq., the Coastal Zone Management \n19  Act (CZMA) 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq., and the NHPA, 54 U.S.C. §§ 300101 et seq., as well as \n20  other provisions of the Clean Water Act itself—namely, Section 401. \n21  34.  Clean Water Act Section 404(e) authorizes the Corps to issue Section 404 permits \n22  on a state, regional, or nationwide basis for certain categories of activities involving discharges \n23  of dredged or fill material. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e); see also 33 C.F.R. §§ 325.5, 330. When the \n24  Corps proposes issuing state, regional, or nationwide permits (collectively, general permits), the \n25  Corps  evaluates  the  categories  of  activity  proposed  for  coverage  under  those  permits  to \n26  determine environmental effects and uses procedures similar to those used during the standard \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   9  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(1) (requiring compliance with Section 404(b)(1) \n2  guidelines); 33 C.F.R. § 325.5(c); 33 C.F.R. Part 330. Entities proposing to discharge subject to \n3  general permits need not submit individual permit applications to obtain permit coverage. See \n4  33 C.F.R. §§ 325.2(e), 330.6. As a result, discharges authorized under general permits are subject \n5  to  less  individual  scrutiny,  but  substantial  limitations  remain  to  prevent  the  Corps  from \n6  authorizing discharges under general permits that risk impacts to water quality, coastal zones, \n7  endangered species, and historic properties. See 33 C.F.R. §§ 325.2, 330.4, 330.5.  \n8  35.   For example, where an applicant for a federal license or a permit is seeking to \n9  conduct an activity “which may result in any discharge into the navigable waters” of a state, the \n10  applicant must receive a water quality certification decision from the state in which the discharge \n11  will occur under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act unless the state waives certification.4 \n12  33 U.S.C. § 1341; see also 33 C.F.R. §§ 320.4(d), 325.2(b)(1). Under the Clean Water Act \n13  Section 401 certification process, states evaluate the applicant’s proposed project for compliance \n14  with applicable state effluent limitations and water quality standards. Having conducted this \n15  review, states can deny, condition, or approve the application for water quality certification \n16  depending on the water quality impacts of the proposed activity. 33 U.S.C.§ 1341(a); 33 C.F.R. \n17  § 325(b)(1)(ii).  \n18  36.  The authority reserved to states in Section 401 is meaningful and significant. In \n19  enacting Section 401, Congress sought to ensure that all activities authorized by the federal \n20  government that may result in a discharge would comply with “State law” and that “Federal \n21  licensing or permitting agencies [could not] override State water quality requirements.” S. Rep. \n22  92-313,  at  69,  reproduced  in  2  Legislative  History  of  the  Water  Pollution  Control  Act \n23  Amendments of 1972 (“Legislative History Vol. 2”), at 1487 (1973). “Congress intended that \n24  [through Section 401] the states would retain the power to block, for environmental reasons, \n25 \n \n4 Some tribal governments have obtained “treatment as a state” status.

FERC, 927 F.2d 616, \n2  622 (D.C. Cir. 1991); see also PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cnty. v. Wash. Dep’t of Ecology, 511 U.S. \n3  700, 721–23 (1994). \n4  37.  This authority is foundational to the Clean Water Act’s system of “cooperative \n5  federalism” and Congress’s preservation of State authority over the waters within their borders. \n6  United States v. Cooper, 482 F.3d 658, 667 (4th Cir. 2007).  \n7  38.  Under the Section 401 regulations, the Corps and certifying State may agree on a \n8  reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year, for the certifying authority to act on the request \n9  for certification. 40 C.F.R. § 121.6. If no agreement is made, the reasonable period defaults to \n10  six months. State analysis under Section 401 can be a highly complex process that can take \n11  months to accomplish after a complete application is received by the state agency with delegated \n12  Clean Water Act permitting authority.  \n13  39.  Additionally, the Corps must seek 401 certification before issuing or reissuing \n14  any general permit, and, although programmatic water quality certifications are often provided, \n15  States retain the right to deny a water quality certification for an activity otherwise meeting the \n16  terms and conditions of a particular general permit. In such instances, the authorization for all \n17  such activities within a state will be denied without prejudice until the state issues an individual \n18  Section 401 certification applicable to such activities or waives the right to do so. See 33 C.F.R. \n19  § 330.4(c)(3).  \n20  40.  The Corps must also ensure that permits issued pursuant to Section 404 have been \n21  evaluated for compliance with the CZMA. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq. The CZMA was enacted \n22  “to preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance, the resources of the \n23  Nation’s coastal zone for this and succeeding generations[,]” and to “encourage the participation \n24  and cooperation of the public, state and local governments, and interstate and other regional \n25  agencies, as well as of the Federal agencies having programs affecting the coastal zone, in \n26  carrying out the purposes of this chapter[.]” 16 U.S.C. § 1452(1), (4).  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   11  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

To that end, the CZMA requires applicants for federal licenses and permits whose \n2  activities will “affect[] any land or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone” of a state—\n3  such as Section 404 permits—to provide “a certification that the proposed activity complies with \n4  the enforceable policies of the State’s approved [Coastal Zone Management Program] and that \n5  such  activity  will  be  conducted  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  program.”  16  U.S.C. \n6  § 1456(c)(1)(A), (c)(3)(A). The State may then concur with the applicant’s certification, or \n7  object. 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A). “No license or permit shall be granted by the Federal agency \n8  until the state or its designated agency has concurred with the applicant’s certification . . . unless \n9  the Secretary [of Commerce] . . . finds, after providing a reasonable opportunity for detailed \n10  comments from the Federal agency involved and from the state, that the activity is consistent \n11  with the objectives of [the CZMA] or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national security.” \n12  Id.\n \n13  42.  The CZMA ensures coastal States can review Corps permits and projects to \n14  determine compliance  with  their  respective  Coastal  Zone Management  Plans,  with  Corps \n15  regulations governing the Coastal Zone Management consistency review process for Section 404 \n16  permit applications. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(b)(2). If the applicant is a federal agency and the State \n17  objects to the proposed federal activity on the basis that its inconsistent with its approved CZM \n18  Program, the Corps cannot make a final decision on the application until the parties have had an \n19  opportunity to utilize the procedures specified by the CZMA for resolving such disagreements, \n20  or the Secretary of Commerce determines that the proposed activity is consistent with the \n21  purposes  of  the  CZMA  or  necessary  in  the  interest  of  national  security.  33  C.F.R. \n22  §§ 325.2(b)(2)(i), (ii).\n \n23  43.  The Corps also must consult with relevant agencies to determine whether any \n24  historic or archeological sites will be impacted by the permitted activity, pursuant to the NHPA, \n25  33 C.F.R. § 325.2(b)(3), 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(1); see also 54 U.S.C. § 306108 (Section 106). \n26  This involves consultation with state and local government representatives, the ACHP, and tribes \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   12  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 608 F.3d 592, 609 (9th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). Section \n5  106 of the NHPA “is a ‘stop, look, and listen’ provision that requires each federal agency to \n6  consider the effects of its programs” and is an important step in ensuring compliance with the \n7  fundamental purpose of the NHPA. Muckleshoot Indian Tribe v. U.S. Forest Service, 177 F.3d \n8  800, 805 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Apache Survival Coalition v. United States, 21 F.3d 895, 906 \n9  (9th Cir. 1994)). \n10  44.  For its part, the ACHP is required to provide federal agencies with advice and \n11  guidance on proper compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA.  \n12  45.  The Corps also must review the application for “potential impact on threatened \n13  or  endangered  species  pursuant  to  section  7  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act.”  33  C.F.R. \n14  § 325.2(b)(5). Where the Corps determines that a proposed activity “may affect an endangered \n15  or threatened species or their critical habitat,” it must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n16  Service and/or the National Marine Fisheries Service. Id. § 325.2(b)(5); see also id. § 320.4(c). \n17  This consultation is required by the ESA. 16 U.S.C. § 1536. \n18  46.  These statutorily mandated protections serve a vital role in protecting the Nation’s \n19  waters, coastlines, endangered species, and historic sites, among other resources, and properly \n20  account for the rights of States to ensure water quality within their borders.  \n21  The Endangered Species Act \n22  47.  The ESA, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531, et seq., is designed to ensure the conservation and \n23  preservation of threatened and endangered plants and animals, as well as the habitats upon which \n24  they rely.  \n25  48.  Section 7 of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. § 1536, requires that each federal agency “in \n26  consultation with and with the assistance of the [Secretaries of Interior and Commerce], insure \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   13  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

In doing \n4  so, the statute commands agencies to “use the best scientific and commercial data available.” Id.  \n5  49.  In practice, Section 7 consultation has been delegated by the Secretaries of \n6  Interior and Commerce to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries \n7  Service respectively. Section 7 consultation is mandatory “if the applicant has any reason to \n8  believe that an endangered species or a threatened species may be present in the area affected by \n9  his project and that implementation of such action will likely affect such species.” 16 U.S.C. \n10  § 1536(a)(3). \n11  50.  The  ESA’s  sole  reference to  any  alteration  of  normal  ESA  procedures  for \n12  Section 7 consultation in an emergency is limited to projects involving an area “declared by the \n13  President to be a major disaster area under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.” \n14  16 U.S.C. § 1536(p). Even then, these procedures (allowing the President to exercise the duties \n15  of the Endangered Species Committee) can only be invoked when the President determines such \n16  action “(1) is necessary to prevent the recurrence of such a natural disaster and to reduce the \n17  potential loss of human life, and (2) to involve an emergency situation which does not allow the \n18  ordinary procedures of [Section 7] to be followed.” Id.  \n19  51.  Implementing regulations are in accord. Regulations applicable to the U.S. Fish \n20  and Wildlife Service limit ESA emergency procedures to situations involving “acts of God, \n21  disasters, casualties, national defense or security emergencies, etc.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.05(a). \n22  Regulations applicable to National Marine Fisheries Service regulations limit ESA emergency \n23  procedures to situations involving “response to natural disasters, or actions to protect public \n24  safety.” 50 C.F.R. § 600.920(a)(1).  \n25   \n26   \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   14  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321, et seq., sets forth a national policy “to use all \n3  practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner \n4  calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under \n5  which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and \n6  other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.” 42 U.S.C. § 4331(a).  \n7  53.  To effectuate this goal, NEPA establishes procedural requirements applicable to \n8  all  proposals  for  major  federal  actions  significantly  affecting  the  quality  of  the  human \n9  environment by requiring agencies to prepare a “detailed statement” including, among other \n10  information,  the  “reasonably  foreseeable  environmental  effects”  of  such  actions,  “any \n11  reasonably foreseeable adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n12  proposal be implemented;” and a “reasonable range of alternatives . . . that are technically and \n13  economically feasible, and meet the purpose and need of the proposal.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).  \n14  54.  On February 25, 2025, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) published a \n15  notice that it was rescinding its decades-old regulations that provided guidance to federal \n16  agencies for implementing NEPA. See 90 C.F.R. 10610. CEQ also advised federal agencies to \n17  revise their own NEPA-implementing regulations and provided additional guidance for NEPA \n18  compliance  in  the  interim.5  CEQ’s  guidance  Memorandum  instructs  federal  agencies  to \n19  “continue to follow their existing practices and procedures for implementing NEPA consistent \n20  with the text of NEPA” and “agencies should consider voluntarily relying on [CEQ’s now-\n21  rescinded] regulations in completing ongoing NEPA reviews.”6  \n22  55.  While  CEQ’s  now-rescinded  regulations  do  not  define  “emergency,”  CEQ \n23  guidance describes use of alternative arrangements in the case of an emergency as “situations \n24  involving immediate threats to human health or safety, or immediate threats to valuable natural \n \n25 \n5 CEQ Memorandum, “Implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act.” Available at: \nhttps://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-and-guidance/CEQ-Memo-Implementation-of-NEPA-02.19.2025.pdf.  \n26 \n6 Id. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   15  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

Federal Laws and Applicable Regulations Limit the Use of Emergency Procedures \nto Actual Emergencies and Do Not Authorize Agencies to Take Action in the \n5 \nManner Contemplated by the Executive Order \n6  Corps’s Emergency Procedures \n7 \n56.  Section 404 of the Clean Water Act does not authorize the Corps or any other \n8 \nagency to issue Section 404 permits on an emergency basis. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344.  \n9 \n57.  Section 404 exempts specific discharges of dredged or fill material “for the \n10 \npurpose of maintenance, including emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts, of \n11 \ncurrently  serviceable  structures  such  as  dikes,  dams,  levees,  groins,  riprap,  breakwaters, \n12 \ncauseways,  and  bridge  abutments  or  approaches,  and  transportation  structures”  from  the \n13  requirement to obtain a permit.9 33 U.S.C. § 1344(f)(1)(B). \n14 \n58.  The single reference to “emergency” in Section 404 thus does not authorize the \n15 \nCorps to issue emergency dredge and fill permits.  \n16 \n59.  Discharges of dredged or fill material for “emergency” maintenance of the type \n17 \ndescribed in Section 404(f)(1)(B) are simply not subject to section 404’s permit requirements. \n18 \nSuch  discharges  are  exempt  from  permitting  under  the  exclusive  list  of  Section  404(f) \n19 \nexemptions (i.e., discharges of dredged or fill material that are not prohibited by or subject to \n20 \nregulation under Section 404. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(f)).  \n21 \n60.  No  other  section  of the Clean  Water  Act  authorizes  emergency  permits  to \n22 \ndischarge dredged or fill material into navigable waters. See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq. \n23 \n \n24 \n7 Emergencies and the National Environmental Policy Act Guidance, available at: \nhttps://ceq.doe.gov/docs/nepa-practice/emergencies-and-nepa-guidance-2020.pdf.  \n25 \n8 Id.  \n9 Clean Water Act Section 404(f) exempted discharges of dredged or fill material may still be subject to \n26 \nregulation under Section 307, 33 U.S.C. § 1317. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(f)(1)(F). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   16  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The Clean Water Act’s only “Emergency Powers” provision authorizes the EPA \n2  Administrator to “bring suit on behalf of the United States . . . to immediately restrain any person \n3  causing or contributing” to pollution “presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to \n4  the health . . . or to the welfare of persons where such endangerment is to the livelihood of such \n5  persons, such as inability to market shellfish, to stop the discharge of pollutants causing or \n6  contributing to such pollution or to take such other action as may be necessary.” See 33 U.S.C. \n7  § 1364. This statutory language demonstrates that Congress contemplated the potential need for \n8  emergency action under the Clean Water Act and expressly authorized only those powers it \n9  thought necessary. Importantly, the emergency powers Congress granted are for the purpose of \n10  protecting waters of the United States and furthering the Clean Water Act’s goals. \n11  62.  Although  the  Clean  Water  Act  does  not  provide  authority  for  emergency \n12  Section 404  permitting,  the  Corps  has  adopted  “emergency  procedures”  in  its  regulations \n13  governing the processing of Section 404 permit applications. 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(e)(4). This \n14  regulation  purports  to  authorize  the  Corps  “to  approve  special  processing  procedures  in \n15  emergency situations.” Id. But this regulation does not authorize broad use emergency permits \n16  to discharge dredged or fill material into navigable waters. See id. \n17  63.  Under the Corps’s regulations, “Emergency” is defined as “a situation which \n18  would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of property, or an immediate, \n19  unforeseen, and significant economic hardship if corrective action requiring a permit is not \n20  undertaken within a time period less than the normal time needed to process the application \n21  under standard procedures.” Id. \n22  64.  In  an  emergency,  “the  district  engineer  will  explain  the  circumstances  and \n23  recommend special procedures to the division engineer who will instruct the district engineer as \n24  to further processing of the application.” Id. \n25  65.  Even in an emergency, the Corps will make “reasonable efforts . . . to receive \n26  comments from interested Federal, state, and local agencies and the affected public.” Id. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   17  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The Corps will also publish “notice of any special procedures authorized” under \n2  33 C.F.R. § 325.2(e)(4), along with their rationale for utilizing “emergency procedures” as soon \n3  as practicable. Id. \n4  67.  Several Corps Districts and Divisions have developed guidance, or adopted \n5  guidance from other Districts, on implementing that limited “emergency procedures” provision. \n6  These guidance documents confirm and further elucidate the provision’s narrow scope and \n7  applicability. Specifically, “emergency procedures” are just that—procedures—and they are \n8  intended to be used only in the event of a real emergency.10  \n9  68.  Guidance from the South Pacific Division, for example, which several Districts \n10  have adopted, reiterates that the Corps’s regulations “provide for abbreviated procedures for the \n11  review, coordination and decision-making with respect to permit applications in emergency \n12  situations, defined as situations that ‘. . . would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a \n13  significant loss of property or an immediate, unforeseen and significant economic hardship.’” \n14  (emphasis added). A true and correct copy of the South Pacific Division guidance is attached \n15  hereto as Exhibit B. \n16  69.  Other Corps guidance similarly clarifies the limited scope and applicability of the \n17  “emergency procedures” provision. For example, the Fort Worth District has issued guidance \n18  stating that “emergency situations” warranting the use of “emergency procedures” are “very \n19  serious situations.” The Fort Worth District guidance provides instructive examples of qualifying \n20  emergency situations, such as “emergencies due to a natural disaster (e.g., flood, hurricane, \n21  earthquake, etc.) or a catastrophic (sudden and complete) failure of a facility due to an external \n22  cause (e.g., a bridge collapse after being struck by a barge).” A true and correct copy of the Fort \n23  Worth District guidance is attached here as Exhibit C. \n24 \n25 \n \n10 The Corps’s regulations provide other “Alternative Procedures,” none of which would be appropriate \n26 \nto issue “emergency permits” directed by Executive Order. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(e)(1)-(3). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   18  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The Forth Worth District guidance further confirms that in real emergency \n2  situations, “[Corps] Division Engineers, in coordination with the [Corps] District Engineers, are \n3  authorized to approve special processing procedures to expedite permit issuance.” (emphasis \n4  added). Exhibit C.  \n5  71.  Other informal guidance from the Corps is in accord. For example, the Seattle \n6  District website states that permit applicants must notify the Corps of “the need to perform \n7  emergency work,” the Corps “has the responsibility to determine if the proposed work is \n8  consistent with the Corps’s definition of an emergency,” and the Corps “may not view an action \n9  as an emergency if the applicant has known of the deficient condition of the failing structure and \n10  has not made reasonable attempts to secure appropriate permits and conduct timely repairs.” \n11  (emphasis added). Importantly, the Seattle District states that emergency decisions “are made on \n12  a case-by-case basis.”11  \n13  72.  Historic permitting data confirms that the Corps utilizes emergency procedures \n14  sparingly and in response to actual emergencies that pose real safety concerns. Online permitting \n15  records dating back to 2010 demonstrate that the Corps has limited use of its emergency \n16  procedures to respond to catastrophic events such as oil spills and natural disasters (e.g., the \n17  Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Floyd, and the devastating 2013 \n18  flooding in Colorado’s front range).12  \n19  73.  “Emergency procedures” may also be used to avoid dangerous situations where \n20  work stoppage required under a Cease & Desist Order issued by the Corps or EPA could result \n21  in a safety issue. 33 C.F.R. § 326.3(c)(4). Even then, the Corps must make a determination, and \n22  publish its rationale for doing so, that the situation was an “emergency” as defined by 33 C.F.R. \n23  § 325.2(e)(4) (i.e., one that “would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of \n24  property, or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship if corrective action \n \n25 \n11 Available at: https://www.nws.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Regulatory/Emergencies/. \n12 List of Corps’s projects previously approved under emergency procedures available at \n26 \nhttps://permits.ops.usace.army.mil/orm-public  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   19  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

Nothing in the Corps’s permitting history suggests the Corps has applied—or is \n4  authorized to apply—emergency procedures to issue permits in the manner commanded by the \n5  Executive Order.  Indeed, the South Pacific Division guidance explicitly states that “[t]he \n6  regulations make no provision for issuing an ‘Emergency Permit’ however that term might be \n7  defined.” Moreover, “emergency procedures” “are not to be utilized to avoid providing prior \n8  public notice of a proposed project or to bypass other procedural requirements,” including but \n9  not  limited  to,  obtaining  water  quality  certification  under  Clean  Water  Act  Section  401. \n10  Exhibit B. \n11  75.  The South Pacific Division guidance further states that “[t]he Clean Water Act at \n12  33 U.S.C. § 1341(a) and 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(b)(1)(ii) preclude the Army Corps from issuing a \n13  permit until Section 401 water quality certification has been obtained or has been waived or if \n14  401 certification has been denied. This remains true in emergency situations.” (emphasis added). \n15  Exhibit B. \n16  76.  Finally, other guidance references the use of “after the fact” permitting in the case \n17  of emergencies. For example, the Albuquerque District notes that “[a]n After the Fact Permit \n18  may be used to authorize emergency work that meets the emergency situation definition at \n19  33 C.F.R. § 325.2(e)(4), and where the work is needed to be performed immediately for safety \n20  reasons and it is not feasible to contact the Corps or the Corps has not responded within an \n21  acceptable time prior to work being conducted.”13 \n22  77.  The Corps’s “after the fact” permitting allows environmental review of projects \n23  that would ordinarily require a Section 404 permit to occur after the work is already completed. \n24  Such procedures are typically utilized as an enforcement tool to rectify unauthorized activities. \n25  33 C.F.R. § 326.3(e). \n \n26 \n13 https://www.spa.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory-Program-and-Permits/Emergency-Permitting/.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   20  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

Interior’s “emergency responses” authority only allows circumventing standard \n3  NEPA procedures with regard to actions needed to control the immediate impacts of threat to \n4  life, property, or important resources. \n5  79.  Interior has adopted regulations governing the use of emergency authority in the \n6  preparation of a NEPA analysis and documentation. 43 C.F.R. § 46.150. These provisions allow \n7  designated Interior Responsible Officials to “determine that an emergency exists that makes it \n8  necessary  to  take  urgently  needed  actions  before  preparing  a  NEPA  analysis  and \n9  documentation.” 43 C.F.R. § 46.150. The regulations effectively bypass Interior’s otherwise \n10  applicable responsibility to comply with NEPA prior to undertaking agency action. \n11  80.  This authority is highly circumscribed, applying only to “those actions necessary \n12  to control the immediate impacts of the emergency that are urgently needed to mitigate harm to \n13  life, property, or important natural, cultural, or historic resources.” 43 C.F.R. § 46.150(a). In \n14  these  limited  circumstances,  Responsible  Officials  must  “take  into  account  the  probable \n15  environmental consequences of [actions taken in response to an emergency] and mitigate \n16  foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the extent practical.” Id. (emphasis added). \n17  81.  The regulations further require the Responsible Official to “document in writing \n18  the determination that an emergency exists and describe the responsive action(s) taken at the \n19  time the emergency [i.e., urgently needed actions to mitigate harm to life, property, or important \n20  natural, cultural, or historic resources] exists.” 43 C.F.R. § 46.150(a)-(b).  \n21  82.  If further emergency actions are required following those needed to control the \n22  immediate impacts of  a threat  to life, property, or important  natural,  cultural, or historic \n23  resources, the regulations contemplate two paths. 43 C.F.R. § 46.150(c)-(d).  \n24  83.  Where such follow-on actions are not likely to have significant environmental \n25  impacts, the Responsible Official must document that determination “in an environmental \n26  assessment and a finding of no significant impact . . . unless categorically excluded.” 43 C.F.R. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   21  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

If the Responsible Official determines subsequent actions related to the emergency \n2  require action prior to completing an environmental assessment and finding of no significant \n3  impact, the Responsible Official must “consult with [Interior’s] Office of Environmental Policy \n4  and Compliance about alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance.” Id.  \n5  84.  Where  such  follow-on  actions  are  likely  to  have  significant  environmental \n6  impacts, Interior’s ability to bypass NEPA requirements are limited. In such circumstances, \n7  Interior  must  “consult  with  [the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality]  about  alternative \n8  arrangements as soon as possible.” 43 C.F.R. § 46.150(d). Even where alternative arrangements \n9  are  developed,  “[s]uch  alternative  arrangements  will  apply  only  to  the  proposed  actions \n10  necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency” with all other proposed actions \n11  remaining “subject to NEPA analysis and documentation in accordance with [Interior’s standard \n12  NEPA procedures].” Id.  \n13  U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Service Emergency Procedures \n14  85.  Both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries \n15  Service have adopted provisions regarding the ESA consultation process during emergency \n16  situations. Emergency procedures for ESA consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n17  and the National Marine Fisheries Service are limited to situations involving acts of God, \n18  disasters, casualties, and other exigencies. \n19  86.  Promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n20  regulations  contain  an  exception  to  the  ESA  consultation  requirement  when  “emergency \n21  circumstances mandate the need to consult in an expedited manner.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.05(a). \n22  These provisions allow ESA consultation to be conducted informally through procedures the \n23  Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determines to be consistent with the ESA. Id. \n24  Even then, however, these procedures apply only to “situations involving acts of God, disasters, \n25  casualties, national defense or security emergencies, etc.” Id. Moreover, the regulations require \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   22  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  regulations  also  allow  after-the-fact \n4  consultation in the event of an emergency. 50 C.F.R. § 600.920(a)(1). Again, however, that \n5  authority is narrowly drawn. These regulations define “emergency” circumstances as actual \n6  emergencies “such as hazardous material clean-up, response to natural disasters, or actions to \n7  protect public safety.” Id.  \n8  88.  Other agency guidance documents confirm the limited applicability of U.S. Fish \n9  and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service emergency provisions. For example, \n10  in the Endangered Species Consultation Handbook, jointly issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n11  Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, emergencies are described (echoing the \n12  definition in 50 C.F.R. § 402.05) as exigent situations, such as those “involving an act of God, \n13  disasters, casualties, national defense or security emergencies, etc., and includes response \n14  activities that must be taken to prevent imminent loss of human life or property.”14 Critically, \n15  the Handbook expands on this point by clarifying that “[p]redictable events … usually do not \n16  qualify as emergencies . . . unless there is a significant unexpected human health risk.”15  \n17  89.  Additionally, in the National Marine Fisheries Service documentation on ESA \n18  consultations,  NOAA  Fisheries  describes  invocation  of  ESA  emergency  consultation  as \n19  applicable to exigent situations where “wildfires, flooding, and other emergency situations \n20  involving national security and other interests require immediate response.”16 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \n24  14 Endangered Species Consultation Handbook, available at: \nhttps://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/endangered-species-consultation-handbook.pdf.  \n15 Id.  \n25 \n16 Endangered Species Act Emergency Consultations on the West Coast, available at: \nhttps://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/consultations/endangered-species-act-emergency-consultations-west-\n26 \ncoast.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The ACHP has adopted regulations regarding the application of Section 106 of \n3  the NHPA during emergency situations. 36 C.F.R. § 800.12. ACHP’s emergency procedures are \n4  limited to situations involving immediate threats to life or property and are time-restricted to \n5  actions implemented within 30 days of the emergency. \n6  91.  The ACHP’s regulations first encourage federal agency officials, in consultation \n7  with appropriate state and tribal historic preservation officers  and the ACHP, to develop \n8  procedures for taking historic resources into account during an emergency. Such procedures only \n9  purport to apply to “operations which respond to a disaster or emergency declared by the \n10  President, a tribal government, or the Governor of a State or which respond to other immediate \n11  threats to life or property.” 36 C.F.R. § 800.12(a) (emphasis added). These procedures must be \n12  approved by the ACHP before being applied. Id.  \n13  92.  Where an agency has not developed approved emergency procedures under \n14  36 C.F.R. § 800.12(a), the agency may comply with Section 106 by either: “(1) Following a \n15  programmatic agreement . . . that contains specific provisions for dealing with historic properties \n16  in emergency situations; or (2) Notifying [the ACHP], the appropriate [state or tribal historic \n17  preservation officer(s)], and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that may attach \n18  religious and cultural significance to historic properties likely to be affected prior to the \n19  undertaking and affording them an opportunity to comment within seven days of notification” \n20  unless circumstances do not permit seven days. 36 C.F.R. § 800.12(b)(1)-(2).

In all events, the emergency compliance with Section 106 “applies only to \n25  undertakings that will be implemented within 30 days after the disaster or emergency has been \n26  formally declared by the appropriate authority.” 36 C.F.R. § 800.12(d) (emphasis added).

Id.  \n3 \nC.  The President Declares a National “Energy Emergency” Despite the Absence of \nAny Emergency \n4 \n5  94.  The President issued Executive Order 14156 on January 20, 2025—day one of \n6  his new Administration. The Executive Order declares a national energy emergency pursuant to \n7  the NEA, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et seq. But the circumstances described in the Executive Order do \n8  not meet even an expansive definition of the term “emergency.” \n9  95.  The Executive Order’s emergency declaration claims a need to remediate an \n10  alleged shortage of energy supplies and shore up an “unreliable” grid to meet the Nation’s needs. \n11  It provides no support for these assertions. It also irrationally proposes actions antithetical to \n12  those alleged needs.  \n13  96.  The Executive Order asserts that “energy and critical minerals [] identification, \n14  leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United \n15  States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.” 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (2025). The \n16  Executive Order’s emergency declaration cites no facts or evidence to support these claims, nor \n17  could it, as domestic energy production is at an all time high and the U.S. is a net-exporter of \n18  energy products. \n19  97.  The  Executive  Order  further  asserts  that  “precariously  inadequate  and \n20  intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action” \n21  and  that  “[w]ithout  immediate  remedy,  [the]  situation  will  dramatically  deteriorate.”  The \n22  Executive Order’s emergency declaration cites no facts or evidence to support these claims, nor \n23  could it.  \n24  98.  Plaintiff States fully support taking appropriate action to ensure a reliable grid \n25  that provides all Americans with affordable energy but, simply put, there is no basis for the \n26  President’s emergency declaration. To the extent they have any merit, concerns about the current \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   25  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

Moreover, the EO itself is internally inconsistent, claiming that our nation suffers \n5  from inadequate energy supplies in one breath while urging actions that would reduce the \n6  availability of those resources for domestic uses in the next.  \n7  100.  In reality, domestic energy production is at an all-time high, thriving due to a \n8  diverse mix of fossil and non-fossil fuel resources, and the Nation’s bulk power system is \n9  resilient. \n10  101.  The United States is producing record quantities of crude oil and natural gas, and \n11  experts predict additional production growth through at least 2026.17 \n12  102.  Given this ample production, oil prices fell for the third consecutive year in 2024 \n13  and are forecast to decline again in 2025.  \n14  103.  The United States produces so much oil and natural gas, in fact, that companies \n15  have said they will not increase output in response to the President’s declaration of a national \n16  energy emergency because it is not economical to do so.18 \n17  104.  The United States also already produces more oil and gas than it uses. It is the \n18  world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas and exports millions of barrels a day of crude \n19  oil. It has been a net energy exporter since 2019, when President Trump declared the nation had \n20  achieved energy independence.19 \n \n21 \n17 U.S. Energy Information Admin., Short-Term Energy Outlook (Feb. 11, 2025).

Confoundingly, the Executive Order claims the Nation has insufficient energy \n2  supplies to meet its needs and address an affordability crisis, while simultaneously proposing to \n3  increase the export of those very same (and allegedly limited) supplies. As the U.S. Department \n4  of Energy recently found, increasing exports will drive up domestic prices for Americans. \n5  President Trump has approved five additional liquified natural gas export terminals since \n6  January 2025 yet has no explanation for increasing exports during an alleged national shortage, \n7  nor any explanation of how ramping up exports will decrease prices for Americans struggling \n8  with energy costs.20 \n9  106.  The Executive Order also excludes solar and wind production from its definition \n10  of “energy,” despite the importance of wind and solar power to grid reliability, energy security, \n11  and affordability. \n12  107.  Wind  and  solar  power  are  consistently  among  the  cheapest  sources  of \n13  electricity.21 They also improve the reliability and affordability of our Nation’s energy supply \n14  by tempering the impact of international commodity price swings on crude oil and natural gas \n15  prices and reducing electric grid operators’ reliance on interruptible natural gas deliveries.22 \n16  108.  Indeed, the United States Department of Energy has acknowledged that “[t]he \n17  rise of renewable power, which comes from unlimited energy resources, like wind, sunlight, \n18  water, and the Earth’s natural heat, has the potential to vastly improve the reliability of the \n19  American energy system.”23 Indeed, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the United \n20   \nU.S. Energy Information Admin., U.S. Energy Facts Explained (July 15, 2024), Available at \n21  https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/imports-and-exports.php; U.S. Energy Independence Set \nNew Record In 2023 \n22  20 See, Trump administration approves Venture Global LNG exports from Louisiana project | Reuters \n21 See https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf \n23  22 U.S. Dep’t of Energy, Energy Reliability and Resilience (last accessed March 11, 2025).

The Executive Order emphasizes the need for more “domestic energy resources,” \n4  but wind and solar resources are produced domestically, too.  \n5  110.  The Executive Order’s myopic focus on fossil fuels further contradicts our \n6  Nation’s  goal  of  promoting  reliable,  diverse,  and  affordable  energy.  Burning  fossil  fuels \n7  increases  the  instances  of  severe  and  extreme  weather  events  that  damage  our  Nation’s \n8  infrastructure and threaten human life. Experts agree that extreme weather fueled by climate \n9  change—not the underproduction of fossil fuels—poses  the most urgent challenge to our \n10  Nation’s electric grid.25 \n11  111.  A diverse portfolio of generation sources that includes local, renewable energy \n12  sources such as solar and wind enhances grid reliability. Wind and solar are also essential to \n13  bolstering local energy generation in regions of the country that do not have abundant fossil fuel \n14  resources. Because fossil fuels must be transported to these regions from other parts of the \n15  country, they are often exposed to the price volatility and reliability risks inherent in purchasing \n16  fuel on an open market. Renewables help to moderate this risk by generating electricity using \n17  locally available resources—wind and solar power.  \n18  112.  In addition, although the Executive Order is purportedly based on a need to assist \n19  Americans living on low- and fixed-incomes, that rationale is undermined by other actions of \n20  the Administration that make it harder for those individuals to pay their electricity and heating \n21  bills by freezing federal funding for and otherwise impeding programs designed to help low-\n22  income households do just that.  \n \n23 \n24 U.S. Dep’t of Energy, Renewable Energy Resource Assessment Information for the United States \n24  (Mar. 2022), at 57.

For example, the Administration unlawfully froze funds to administer: (i) the \n2  Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, 42 U.S.C. § 8621(a), which is designed to help \n3  States ensure that low-income residents have heat and power in the winter, (ii) the Solar for All \n4  program, 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1), which funds rooftop solar panels and storage systems for \n5  installation  in  low-income  and  disadvantaged  communities,  and  (iii)  the  High-Efficiency \n6  Electric Home Rebate Act, 42 U.S.C. § 18795a, which provides rebates for low- and moderate-\n7  income households for heat pumping and cooling and electrification projects. Funding under \n8  those programs was ordered to be restored pursuant to court order.26  \n9  114.  And, on or around April 1, 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services \n10  laid off the entire staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.  \n11  115.  The  Executive  Order’s  emergency  declaration  is  not  based  on  any  real \n12  emergency, nor does the Executive Order attempt to address one. Rather, it is based on the \n13  assertion of an unfounded, false “emergency” declared largely in response to disagreement with \n14  “the policies of the previous administration” and of states in the Northeast and West Coast. \n15  90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (2025). \n16 \nD.  Under  the  Guise  of  a  National  “Energy  Emergency,”  Executive  Order  14156 \nCommands Unlawful Action \n17 \n18  116.  In response to the alleged energy emergency, the Executive Order directs federal \n19  agencies to “identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well \n20  as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, \n21  production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but \n22  not limited to, on Federal lands.” Id. (emphasis added). \n23  117.  The Executive Order requires agencies to “identify and use all relevant lawful \n24  emergency  and  other  authorities . . . to  expedite  the  completion  of  all  authorized  and \n25 \n \n26 See Memorandum and Order on Motion for a Preliminary Injunction in State of New York, et al. v. \n26 \nDonald Trump (D.R.I.

Id. (emphasis added). \n3  118.  Of particular note, the Executive Order specifically directs that “[t]o protect the \n4  collective national and economic security of the United States, agencies shall identify and use \n5  all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to facilitate the supply, refining, and \n6  transportation of energy in and through the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the \n7  United States, and Alaska.” Id. (emphasis added). \n8  119.  According to the Executive Order, the Nation’s energy related problems are \n9  “most pronounced” in the Northeast and West Coast due to “State and local policies” that the \n10  Administration disagrees with. Not only does the Order fail to reference any specific policy or \n11  explain how such policies create or exacerbate the Nation’s energy-related problems, but the \n12  President has no authority under the NEA or otherwise to order the use of emergency authorities \n13  in specific regions of the United States based merely on policy disagreements. Id. \n14  120.  Moreover, the assertion that state and local energy policies in the Northeast and \n15  on the West Coast “jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs and \n16  devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population” is \n17  completely unsupported. Id. Washington State has some of the lowest energy prices in the Nation \n18  (and also some of the cleanest energy).27 New York has the most energy-efficient state economy \n19  in the Nation and consumes less total energy per capita than every state but Rhode Island.28 For \n20  years, Massachusetts has consistently ranked as the most or one of the most energy efficient \n21  states in the Nation, recognized for its “efforts to transition its utility energy efficiency programs \n22   \n27 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Western Information Office, Average Energy Prices, Seattle-Tacoma-\n23  Bellevue–December 2024 (December 2024), (“The 13.9 cents per kWh Seattle households paid for electricity in \nDecember 2024 was 21.0 percent less than the nationwide average of 0.176 cents per kWh.

These Northeastern and West Coast states have cut harmful emissions from the \n5  power sector while growing their economies at a greater rate than the national average.30  \n6  122.  The Executive Order does not explain, nor could it, how reduced emissions from \n7  the power sector has any effect on national security, let alone jeopardizing it, nor how our \n8  growing state economies devastate anyone’s prosperity.  \n9  123.  The Executive Order goes on to specifically command the Corps to, within thirty \n10  (30) days of the Order’s execution, “identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation’s \n11  energy supply that may be subject to emergency treatment pursuant to the regulations and \n12  nationwide permits promulgated by the Army Corps . . . pursuant to section 404 of the Clean \n13  Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344,” and other Army Corps permitting authorities.31 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 \n14  (2025). \n15  124.  The Executive Order further directs agencies to “use, to the fullest extent possible \n16  and consistent with applicable law, the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions to facilitate \n17  the Nation’s energy supply.” Id.  \n18 \n \n19 \n29 See Massachusetts Recognized as National Leader in Energy Efficiency: Takes One of Top \nSpots for Programs that Reduce Energy Costs, Improve Living Conditions and Create Jobs, \n20 \nMassachusetts Department of Energy Resources press release (March 20, 2025), available at \nhttps://www.mass.gov/news/massachusetts-recognized-as-national-leader-in-energy-efficiency, citing \n21 \nThe American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) annual State Energy \n22  Efficiency Scorecard, available at https://www.aceee.org/state-policy/scorecard. \n30 See e.g., Analysis Group, The Economic Impacts of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative on Ten \n23  Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States (May 2023), at 12 (over 12-year period, program resulted in 46% reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions, raised $3.8 billion in allowance revenues, generated net economic benefits of $5.7 \n24  billion, and added about 48,000 jobs), https://www.analysisgroup.com/Insights/publishing/the-economic-impacts-\nof-the-regional-greenhouse-gas-initiative-on-ten-northeast-and-mid-atlantic-\nstates2/#:~:text=The%20study%20also%20found%20that,and%20added%2048%2C000%20job%2Dyears. \n25 \n31 The Corps also has, and the Executive Order purports to apply to, permitting authority under \nsection 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. 403, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and \n26 \nSanctuaries Act, 33 U.S.C. 1413.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   31  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The Executive Order directs agencies “to use, to the maximum extent permissible \n2  under applicable law, the ESA regulation on [ESA] consultations in emergencies, to facilitate \n3  the Nation’s energy supply.” Id. The Executive order identifies the ESA emergency regulations \n4  as those “promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce” pursuant \n5  to the ESA. Id.  \n6  126.  In short, based on nothing but the unsupported Emergency Declaration, the \n7  Executive Order illegally commands federal agencies, including the Corps, Interior, and ACHP, \n8  to disregard laws critical to protecting the environment, historic and cultural resources, and State \n9  sovereignty. \n10 \nE.  Federal Agencies Are Currently Implementing, or Are Planning to Implement, the \nExecutive Order in Ways That Exceed Their Statutory Authority \n11 \nCorps’s implementation of the Executive Order \n12 \n13  127.  As particularly relevant here, the Executive Order directs the Secretary of the \n14  Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, to “identify planned \n15  or potential actions to facilitate the Nation's energy supply that may be subject to emergency \n16  treatment pursuant to the regulations and nationwide permits promulgated by the [Army] Corps, \n17  or jointly by the Corps and EPA, pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \n18  1344, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403, and section \n19  103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1413.” 90 Fed. \n20  Reg. 8433 (2025). \n21  128.  The Corps is actively implementing that directive in the Executive Order.  \n22  129.  The Corps maintains an online database of “Regulatory and Section 408 Publicly \n23  Available Data” (Permitting Database).32 Among other information, the Permitting Database \n24  contains Clean Water Act Section 404 projects and proposals, including final individual permits, \n25 \n \n26 \n32Available at https://permits.ops.usace.army.mil/orm-public \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The Permitting Database allows users to view “emergency” permit data filtered \n4  by “event.” It also allows users to download permit data in spreadsheet form, including for \n5  projects approved under emergency procedures.  \n6  131.  Historically, the Permitting Database “events” field for emergency permit data \n7  identified prior emergencies caused by hurricane, storm, and flood events, as well as the \n8  Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  \n9  132.  On or around February 17, 2025, the Army Corps added to the Permitting \n10  Database a new event type under its emergency list: “EO 14156 Declaring a National Energy \n11  Emergency.” This new category listed 688 permits for various projects across the country. A \n12  true and correct copy of permit data available on February 19, 2025, is attached hereto as \n13  Exhibit D (Project List).  \n14  133.  Many  of  the  projects  on  the  Project  List  were  identified  as  qualifying  for \n15  authorization under various general permits. However, approximately 80 projects were listed as \n16  proceeding under an individual permit or the permitting procedure was listed as “unknown.”  \n17  134.  For  example,  the  list  included  the  Cascade  Renewable  Transmission  LLC \n18  Columbia River Project. This project is a significant undertaking that has been years in the \n19  making and involves installation of an underground, in-water transmission line traversing \n20  approximately 100 miles of the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon. Because of \n21  the potential impacts to the River, the project was appropriately identified as requiring extensive \n22  environmental review. According to the project proponent, “the entire project will undergo \n23  multi-year public reviews and will be required to obtain multiple federal, state, and local \n24  environmental permits. The project will be responsive to tribal concerns, and qualified scientists \n25  and environmental and cultural resource specialists will advise each aspect of the project \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   33  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The  project  is  currently  in  the  pre-application  stage.  Given  the  size  and \n5  complexity of this project, it is expected that the state Section 401 certification processes will \n6  take six or more months once a completed application for certification is received. Permitting \n7  this project without the rigorous environmental review previously identified as necessary and \n8  required would represent a radical—and unlawful—departure from the anticipated plan and the \n9  Corps permitting procedures for projects of this scale and undermine the Washington’s and \n10  Oregon’s rights and abilities to ensure that sufficient water quality protections are in place to \n11  protect the States’ resources and residents.  \n12  136.  The Corps’s Project List was not limited to energy related proposals. The list of \n13  emergency projects included permitting related the West Coyote Hills housing development in \n14  California, a joint project between Chevron and Pacific Coast Homes to redevelop a former oil \n15  field for residential use.  \n16  137.  On or around February 20, 2025, as media reports began to circulate around the \n17  Project List and the Corps’s response to the Executive Order, the vast majority of projects on the \n18  Project List disappeared from the Permitting Database altogether, including projects that had \n19  been identified as needing individual permits, creating uncertainty about the Corps’s plans for \n20  these proposed projects. \n21  138.  However, on February 13, 2025, the Corps emailed officials for the State of \n22  Connecticut indicating the Corps’s “intent to establish emergency permitting procedures across \n23  the New England District, pursuant to the National Energy declaration in Executive Order \n24  14156.” A true and correct copy of this email is attached hereto as Exhibit E. The email included \n25  the Executive Order as an attachment.

On February 21, 2025, the Corps followed up on this email with a list of questions \n2  regarding the Executive Order. Specifically, the Corps stated that it “is working on expedited \n3  procedures with a goal to implement [emergency permitting] by Feb. 28th” and that, for those \n4  projects identified, “we’ll be asking for a response from the state within a limited number of \n5  days, example water quality certification.” The Corps then inquired as to whether Connecticut \n6  had “procedures in place you utilize in an emergency” and asked “[w]hat do you normally do \n7  during an emergency (i.e. flood event).” A true and correct copy of this email is attached hereto \n8  as Exhibit F. \n9  140.  On February 21, 2025, the Corps sent Connecticut a spreadsheet “of pending \n10  permit applications in Connecticut that [the Corps] has currently identified as meeting the intent \n11  of Executive Order 14156 for energy emergency projects.” The list of projects in the spreadsheet \n12  included all of the projects previously identified for Connecticut in the Project List and expanded \n13  on the Project List by adding four additional projects. A true and correct copy of this email is \n14  attached hereto as Exhibit F. \n15  141.  On  March  4,  2025,  the  Corps  sent  officials  for  the  Commonwealth  of \n16  Massachusetts an email regarding emergency permitting under the Executive Order. A true and \n17  correct copy of this email is attached hereto as Exhibit G.  \n18  142.  The Corps’s email to Massachusetts included a copy of the Executive Order and \n19  indicated the Corps’s commitment to immediately implementing its directives, stating that \n20  “[g]oing forward energy actions will be treated as emergencies under EO 14156,” and that there \n21  was  a  need  to  “significantly  shorten”  regulatory  review  periods.  While  the  Corps  has \n22  acknowledged that Massachusetts is entitled to a six-month time frame for Section 401 water \n23  quality certifications under EPA’s Section 401 regulations, in its email, the Corps also asserted \n24  that it “will have more energy actions in the future and need[s] a path forward.” Exhibit G. \n25  143.  The email to Massachusetts also included a spreadsheet identifying thirteen \n26  projects that the Corps intended to approve using emergency procedures under the Executive \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   35  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

Approximately  half  of  the  projects  had  been  included  in  the  Project  List  for \n2  Massachusetts. The other projects in the spreadsheet were newly identified.  \n3  144.  The Corps has requested that Massachusetts issue Clean Water Act Section 401 \n4  certifications for these “emergency” projects (a process that typically takes weeks or even \n5  months) in two to three days, though the Corps recently admitted that Massachusetts is entitled \n6  to a six-month time frame for Section 401 water quality certifications under EPA’s Section 401 \n7  regulations.  \n8  145.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Plaintiff  States  understand  that  similar  lists \n9  identifying, and expanding upon, projects first identified in the Project List have been provided \n10  to other states. \n11  146.  On or around April 1, 2025, numerous Army Corps Districts posted “Special \n12  Public Notice” documents on official websites announcing that “special emergency processing \n13  procedures” had been approved and that final guidance on their use would be posted on District \n14  websites by April 15, 2025. \n15  147.  As of April 15, 2025, the Army Corps has now issued final guidance on the use \n16  of emergency processing procedures in response to Executive Order 14156 (Energy Emergency \n17  Guidance). The guidance has largely been issued on a District-by-District basis, although some \n18  Energy Emergency Guidance documents purport to cover multiple Districts within a Division. \n19  148.  Specifically, for Plaintiff States, the following Districts have issued or adopted \n20  Energy Emergency Guidance applicable to Plaintiff States: Seattle District, Portland District, \n21  Omaha District, Kansas City District, San Francisco District, Sacramento District, Los Angeles \n22  District, Albuquerque District, St. Paul District, Rock Island District, Detroit District, New York \n23  District, New England District, Philadelphia District, Baltimore District, and Chicago District \n24  (Energy Emergency Guidance).  \n25  149.  While there are some differences between Districts, the Energy Emergency \n26  Guidance  documents  largely  contain  the  same  key  elements,  indicating  that  the  Energy \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   36  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 37 of 61\n \n1  Emergency Guidance documents issued by the Districts were pursuant to a common template \n2  issued by Corps headquarters.  \n3  150.  For  example,  Energy  Emergency  Guidance  purports  to  apply  to  “special \n4  emergency processing procedures . . . to authorize energy related  activities . . . under E.O. \n5  14156, Declaring a National Energy Emergency.” See, e.g., Exhibit H at 1 (Seattle Guidance). \n6  The Energy Emergency Guidance provides that “for the reasons stated in [the Executive Order] \n7  the  President  has  found  that  insufficient  energy  production,  transportation,  refining,  and \n8  generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation’s economy, national \n9  security, and foreign policy.” See, e.g., id.  \n10  151.  The  Energy  Emergency  Guidance  further  states  that  special  emergency \n11  procedures are “approved for activities associated with the identification, siting, production, \n12  transportation,  refining,  and  generation  of  domestic  energy  sources,  including  energy \n13  infrastructure” requiring permitting by the Corps under “Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, \n14  and/or “Section 103 of the Marine Research, Protection, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as \n15  amended, where there would be an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of property, or \n16  an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship if the action requiring a permit is \n17  not undertaken within a time period less than the normal time needed to process the application \n18  under standard procedures.” See, e.g., id. \n19  152.  Despite this language, as well as the Corps’s regulations expressly defining an \n20  “emergency” as “a situation which would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant \n21  loss of property, or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship,” 33 C.F.R. § \n22  325.2(e)(4), the Energy Emergency Guidance does not require a separate finding that the \n23  regulatory definition is met for a project to qualify for emergency procedures. Id. Instead, the \n24  Energy Emergency Guidance simply requires the Corps to “[c]onfirm whether the activity meets \n25  the criteria for an energy-related emergency per the E.O.” See, e.g., id. at 14. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   37  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 38 of 61\n \n1  153.  In terms of process, the Energy Emergency Guidance notes that Districts will \n2  “fulfill as many standard procedures … as are reasonably tailored to the energy emergency \n3  situation,”  but  that  Districts  “will  not  delay  a  timely  response  because  of  any  standard \n4  procedures.” Id. at 4. For applications requiring an individual permit, Districts will “potentially” \n5  include public notice “up to” 15 days. Id. at 5.  \n6  154.  In no case are public notice and comment periods guaranteed, even for large \n7  projects that require an individual permit.  \n8  155.  For water quality certifications under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, the \n9  Energy Emergency Guidance largely defers to EPA’s Section 401 Rule. While the Energy \n10  Emergency Guidance acknowledges that projects approved pursuant to emergency procedures \n11  require a water quality certification from the applicable certifying authority, the Guidance \n12  requires districts to seek 25-day turn-arounds from the applicable state or tribal authority.  \n13  156.  For ESA compliance, the Energy Emergency Guidance, in line with other Corps \n14  emergency guidance documents and citing to 50 C.F.R. § 402.05, allows formal consultation \n15  with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to occur after the \n16  “emergency” response. See, e.g., Exhibit H at 6–7 (Seattle Guidance).  \n17  157.  For compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, the Corps’s guidance references \n18  use of the ACHP emergency provisions drafted in response to the Executive Order (described \n19  below). See, e.g., Exhibit H at 7–8.  \n20  158.  The day after the Corps finished rolling out its Energy Emergency Guidance, \n21  April 16, 2025, the Corps began moving forward with identifying and approving projects not \n22  currently identified by any party as constituting an emergency to be permitted pursuant to \n23  emergency procedures as directed by the Executive Order.  \n24  159.  In Washington State, there are already at least four projects that will use the \n25  Corps’s  emergency  procedures  pursuant  to  the  Executive  Order.  Specifically,  Northwest \n26  Pipeline LLC has four proposed projects in Washington that have already received the Corps’s  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   38  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 39 of 61\n \n1  approval that the projects meet the Executive Order and that the Corps it will use emergency \n2  procedures to permit.  \n3  160.  The two projects that have received approval  to use emergency processing \n4  procedures issued by the Corps’s Seattle District are the Tributary to Gosnell Creek Project and \n5  the Chehalis to Washougal Anomaly Digs Pipeline Repair Project.  \n6  161.  The Corps issued a Public Notice for the Tributary to Gosnell Creek Project on \n7  April 25, 2025, with an expiration date, or deadline to comment date, of May 5, 2025. Exhibit I. \n8  The Tributary to Gosnell Creek Project involves channel realignment of a tributary and grading \n9  activity to lower and widen the stream floodplain. The Project will fill nearly six hundred square \n10  feet of the existing channel, and about 681 feet of new channel will be created as part of the \n11  channel realignment. The south bank of the stream will be graded on top of the pipeline. Id.  This \n12  project is expected to be constructed sometime between July 15 through September 15, 2026, \n13  and  will  require an  individual  401  water quality  certification  from  the  Washington  State \n14  Department of Ecology. \n15  162.  According  to  the  Biological  Opinion  for  the  Gosnell  Creek  Project,  three \n16  federally threatened species and two proposed threatened species have the potential to occur in \n17  the project area. While no critical habitat for threatened species exists within the proposed project \n18  area, critical habitat for Puget Sound winter steelhead (a federally threatened species) occurs as \n19  close as 350 feet downstream of the proposed project area and indirect impacts on steelhead and \n20  its critical habitat are anticipated.  \n21  163.  The Chehalis to Washougal Anomaly Digs Pipeline Repair Project involves \n22  repairs of an existing 30-inch natural gas pipeline in the Little Washougal River in Clark County, \n23  Washington.  Construction  for  this  project  was  anticipated  to  go  from  August  1  through \n24  August 31, 2027 but now is anticipated to go through the month of August in 2026, based on the \n25  use of the Executive Order emergency procedures. Exhibit J. The project is about 1.8 acres in \n26  size and, while fish salvage is to be conducted to remove fish that have the potential to be \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   39  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

An individual 401 water quality certification will also be required for \n4  this project.  \n5  164.  The third Northwest  Pipeline LLC project in Washington that will  use the \n6  Executive Order emergency procedures is the Kelso Beaver Reliability Project. This project in \n7  Cowlitz County will involve converting 3.27 acres of property to industrial use for a new electric \n8  moto-driven compressor station, modifications to an existing meter station, and modifications to \n9  existing above ground facilities. The anticipated construction for this project is in the third \n10  quarter of 2026 with operations to begin in November 2028. The Project requires a FERC license \n11  and will need an individual 401 water quality certification from Washington.  \n12  165.  The fourth project that Northwest Pipeline LLC plans to use the Executive Order \n13  emergency procedures process for is the Columbia River Portland Lateral Horizontal Directional \n14  Drilling Project. This project involves decommissioning an existing 16-inch pipeline that crosses \n15  beneath the Columbia River from Washington to Oregon, and installing an approximately 4,670 \n16  foot-long, 18-inch pipeline in its place. The new pipeline would be installed via horizontal \n17  directional drilling with an additional 280 feet of pipeline being installed via conventional open-\n18  trench installation in upland areas on both sides of the Columbia River to connect the new \n19  pipeline segment to the existing Portland Lateral Pipeline. Segments of the Columbia River near \n20  the project area provide important habitat for multiple endangered and threatened species, \n21  including chinook and coho salmon as well as steelhead. This project involves work in water \n22  and is expected to have impacts to over five acres of wetlands in Washington State. It will require \n23  an individual 401 water quality certification from Washington.  \n24  166.  Based on the Corps’s actions, Plaintiff States anticipate that the Corps will \n25  continue  to  use  emergency  procedures  to  issue  Section  404  permits  for  many  projects \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   40  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

On April 23, 2025, and citing the Executive Order, Interior issued a press release \n5 \nentitled “Department of the Interior Implements Emergency Permitting Procedures to Strengthen \n6 \nDomestic Energy Supply,” announcing its intent to “accelerate the development of domestic \n7  energy resources and critical minerals.”34 The press release touted that “[t]he new permitting \n8  procedures will take a multi-year process down to just 28 days at most.”35 The press release \n9 \nstated that the procedures would apply to: crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas \n10 \nliquids,  refined  petroleum  products,  uranium,  coal,  biofuels,  geothermal  energy,  kinetic \n11  hydropower, and critical minerals.36 \n12 \n168.  The same day, April 23, 2025, Interior simultaneously announced the adoption of \n13 \n“alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance” (Alternative Arrangements), attached hereto \n14 \nas Exhibit K. In doing so, Interior cited the Executive Order as the basis for the Alternative \n15 \nArrangements. Purporting to act pursuant to Interior’s emergency NEPA provisions in 43 C.F.R. \n16 \n§ 46.150, the Alternative Arrangements note that they were adopted in coordination with and the \n17 \nauthorization of the CEQ.  \n18 \n169.  The  Alternative  Arrangements  do  not  follow  Interior’s  own  regulations \n19 \ngoverning when alternative NEPA procedures can be adopted.  \n20 \n170.  The Alternative Arrangements also represent a radical departure from normal \n21 \nNEPA procedure that show little ability to satisfy NEPA statutory requirements, including \n22 \nNEPA’s basic command that Interior assess the environmental effects of its actions prior to \n23 \nundertaking them.  \n24 \n \n34 Available at: https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/department-interior-implements-emergency-\n25 \npermitting-procedures-strengthen-domestic.  \n35 Id. \n26 \n36 Id. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   41  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 42 of 61\n \n1  171.  First, the Alternative Arrangements include an application form requiring project \n2  applicants wishing to invoke Alternative Arrangements for qualifying projects with project \n3  information, including the proposed plan of operation or underlying permit application. Id. \n4  Regardless of the level of detail provided, the Responsible Official has little time to consider the \n5  project prior to making a decision. For projects that the Responsible Official determines not \n6  likely to have significant environmental impacts, the Responsible Official must prepare an \n7  environmental assessment within “approximately 14 days” of receipt of the application. Id. at 2. \n8  The Responsible Official will “concurrently within the same period” prepare documentation \n9  supporting a “finding of no significant impact.” Id. No public comment is required from at any \n10  stage of this process up to and including the final decision. Id.  \n11  172.  Even for projects likely to have significant environmental impacts, the process is \n12  hardly more robust. The Responsible Official will “publish a notice of intent to prepare an \n13  environmental  impact  statement  …  soliciting  written  comments  and  announcing  a  public \n14  meeting.” Id. The Responsible official exercises complete discretion over the length of the public \n15  comment period but, in any event, Interior “anticipates that most comment periods will be \n16  approximately 10 days.” Id. After publishing the notice of intent, the Responsible Official has a \n17  mere 28 days to prepare an environmental impact statement. Id. The environmental impact \n18  statement itself must  be “concise,” containing  only “a brief description of environmental \n19  effects.” Id. There is no obligation to “publish a draft environmental impact statement” for public \n20  review prior to finalizing and recording the agency’s final decision. Id.  \n21  173.  On or around April 23, 2025, Interior also adopted “Alternative Procedures for \n22  Informal Section 7 Consultation” (Alternative ESA Procedures) pursuant to the Executive Order. \n23  Attached hereto as Exhibit L.  \n24  174.  The Alternative ESA Procedures require the Secretary of Interior, the appropriate \n25  Assistant Secretary, their acting equivalents, or those officials exercising the delegated authority \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   42  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

The  Alternative  ESA  Procedures,  thus,  completely  skip  otherwise  required \n4  formal consultation under the ESA entirely and only require “[a]s soon as practicable under the \n5  circumstances,” ESA consultation “following termination or expiration of the national energy \n6  emergency.” Id.at 2.  \n7  176.  As of the time of filing, Plaintiff States are not aware of Interior’s application of \n8  its NEPA Alternative Arrangements or Alternative ESA Procedures for projects located within \n9  Plaintiff States. Should Interior move forward with Alternative Arrangements for such projects, \n10  Plaintiff States will seek to amend this complaint accordingly. \n11  ACHP’s implementation of the Executive Order \n12  177.  On or around March 27, 2025, the ACHP published on its website a document \n13  titled  “Section  106  Emergency  Provisions  and  the  Executive  order  Declaring  a  National \n14  Emergency.” Attached hereto as Exhibit M. This guidance purports to provide information “to \n15  assist  agencies  in  implementing  the  terms  of  the  Executive  Order  in  regard  to  historic \n16  preservation reviews.” Id. at 1.  \n17  178.  Pursuant to this guidance, the ACHP directs “for any proposed undertaking that \n18  falls within the scope of the Executive Order, agencies should follow the terms of any applicable \n19  Section 106 agreement that contains emergency provisions.” Id. Where such agreements do not \n20  exist, the guidance states that “agencies can avail themselves of the expedited emergency \n21  provisions in Section 800.12(b)(2) of the Section 106 regulations.” Id. \n22  179.  In terms of the length of time applicable to use of emergency Section 106 \n23  provisions, the guidance provides that “[w]hile Section 800.12 only applies for 30 days following \n24  an emergency declaration, pursuant to Section 800.12(d), the ACHP is hereby extending the \n25  applicability of Section 106 emergency provisions to run for the duration of the Presidential \n26  declaration.” Id. at 2. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   43  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 44 of 61\n \n1  180.  To Plaintiff States knowledge, no federal agency has requested that ACHP extend \n2  the applicability of emergency provisions for Section 106 consultation in response to the \n3  Executive Order.  \n4  181.  Federal  agencies  are  now  following  ACHP’s  decision  that  Section  106 \n5  consultations can be done on an emergency basis pursuant to the Executive Order. \n6 \nF.  Use of Emergency Procedures Harms the States  \n7  182.  The Corps’s unlawful use of emergency procedures in non-emergency situations \n8  to comply with the President’s illegal Executive Order will result in irreparable injury to Plaintiff \n9  States’ proprietary, sovereign, and quasi-sovereign interests.  \n10  Direct harms to proprietary interests \n11  183.  The States have proprietary interests in their natural resources, such as the health \n12  and useability of their waters for drinking, agriculture, recreation, and habitat, and the wildlife \n13  and biota that rely on aquatic and riparian habitats, as well as historic and cultural resources. \n14  Harm to these resources directly injures the States’ proprietary interests.  \n15  184.  Harms to these interests are inherent when emergency procedures are invoked to \n16  fast-track review, short-circuit coordination, and jam through permit approvals on an expedited \n17  basis. These procedures are not just bureaucratic red tape. They serve important purposes by \n18  ensuring the action  agency makes permit decisions  based on a full  understanding of the \n19  environmental, social, historic, and geological factors at the project site.  \n20  185.  For just one example, during the winter of 2020 in Washington State, the Corps \n21  issued a Section 404 permit using emergency procedures to Skagit County Drainage District 21, \n22  bypassing the Section 401 Certification process with the Washington State Department of \n23  Ecology (Washington). \n24  186.  The Corps’s decision to use emergency procedures in that instance was based on \n25  issues observed from prior flooding, which may have qualified for treatment as an emergency. \n26  But, because the Corps and project proponent failed to work with Ecology through typical \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   44  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 45 of 61\n \n1  permitting procedures, the project did not reflect Washington’s expertise and unique knowledge \n2  and understanding of the area’s flooding conditions. Specifically, if the Corps had followed \n3  typical permitting procedures, it would have learned from Washington that flooding in that area \n4  would occur no matter how much dredging was completed and harms from a futile dredging \n5  project would have been avoided.  \n6  187.  Instead, the project resulted in an inadequately stabilized, oversized channel that \n7  was not constructed to prevent erosion and the deposition of large amounts of sediment into \n8  Nookachamps Creek and did nothing to address flooding. Sedimentation is a well-known \n9  problem for riparian habitat as it can bury stream beds, smother spawning grounds, interfere with \n10  aquatic life, and alter the chemical and physical makeup of a waterway. As a result, this event \n11  was particularly concerning for Nookachamps Creek as it is a critical tributary of the Skagit \n12  River and provides habitat for coho, chum, chinook, pink, and sockeye salmon as well as \n13  steelhead trout. Chinook from the Skagit Watershed are a critical source of food for endangered \n14  Southern Resident Orcas in Puget Sound. \n15  188.  This example, and resulting harms to natural resources, are likely to be repeated \n16  around the country (including Plaintiff States) under the Executive Order and its command that \n17  the  Corps,  Interior,  and  other  agencies  invoke  emergency  procedures,  bypassing  critical \n18  environmental review for hundreds—if not thousands—of energy-related projects now and in \n19  the future.  \n20  189.  And, although use of emergency procedures may still require “after-the-fact” \n21  review and permitting under multiple federal statutes, which might address some negative effects \n22  of projects rushed through permitting, “after-the-fact” review does not replace the evaluations \n23  required as part of the normal permitting process.  \n24  190.  For example, the ESA implementing regulations include an emergency provision \n25  explaining  that  “[f]ormal  consultation  shall  be  initiated  as  soon  as  practicable  after  [an] \n26  emergency is under control.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.05(b).  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   45  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 46 of 61\n \n1  191.  But retroactively attempting to rectify environmental harms to various species, \n2  habitat, and other natural resources will almost certainly result in a worse outcome for the \n3  resources in question than proactively identifying and determining how to avoid, minimize, \n4  and/or appropriately mitigate those impacts before issuing a permit.  \n5  192.  For example, the “take” of an endangered species or damage to cultural or historic \n6  resources cannot be undone after-the-fact.  \n7  193.  This is why informal consultation under the ESA is required even in an actual \n8  emergency to which 50 C.F.R. § 402.05 applies, namely “situations involving acts of God, \n9  disasters, casualties, national defense or security emergencies.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.05(a) (“Where \n10  emergency circumstances mandate the need to consult in an expedited manner, consultation may \n11  be conducted informally through alternative procedures that the Director determines to be \n12  consistent with the requirements of sections 7(a)–(d) of the Act”). \n13  194.  But informal emergency consultation is no substitute for the more rigorous \n14  process set out in the ESA for non-emergencies—i.e., situations that do not involve the limited \n15  set of actual emergencies set out in 50 C.F.R. § 402.05(a)—and is designed to yield to the \n16  permitting authority. In fact, the ESA Section 7 Consultation Handbook issued by the U.S. Fish \n17  and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, advises the Services that, when \n18  it comes to emergency procedures, “DO NOT stand in the way of response efforts” (emphasis \n19  original).37 \n20  195.  The Clean Water Act preserves the States’ existing powers to adopt conditions \n21  and restrictions necessary to protect state waters. Any use of emergency procedures to preclude \n22  or inhibit the States from exercising their authority to protect state waters, through evading or \n23  unlawfully restricting time to issue Section 401 certifications, is contrary to the language in the \n24  Clean Water Act. Contrary to the Clean Water Act’s system of “cooperative federalism,” it also \n25 \n \n37 Available at: https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/endangered-species-consultation-\n26 \nhandbook.pdf.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   46  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

For example, many Plaintiff States own or hold in trust the fish and other wildlife \n4  populations within their borders and have certain statutory obligations to protect these resources. \n5  Because the Corps’s improper—and unlawful—use of emergency procedures will undermine \n6  the States’ ability to fully protect the aquatic habitat and resources those species rely upon for \n7  survival, this practice causes or substantially risks direct harms to the States’ wildlife and wildlife \n8  populations. \n9  197.  That use of emergency procedures curtails environmental review of projects \n10  needing a Section 404 permit will undoubtedly result in negative impacts to the environment \n11  further exemplifies why this practice is—and must be—limited to actual emergencies. \n12  Direct harms to sovereign interests \n13  198.  In addition to impacts to state natural resources themselves, the improper use of \n14  emergency procedures directly harms state sovereign interests, including costs associated with \n15  “filling the regulatory gap” and other administrative and compliance costs. See New Jersey v. \n16  Env’t Prot. Agency, 989 F.3d 1038, 1045–49 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (finding New Jersey had standing \n17  to challenge EPA reporting rule under the Claim Air Act because inadequate requirements \n18  imposed “administrative costs and burdens” on the state).  \n19  199.  For example, in addition to contravening the Clean Water Act’s objective of \n20  restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters, \n21  33 U.S.C. § 1251(a), and directly harming Plaintiff States’ proprietary interests in their natural \n22  resources, the Corps’s illegal use of emergency procedures to implement the unlawful Executive \n23  Order undermines the Plaintiff States’ recognized authority under Clean Water Section 401, and \n24  imposes increased regulatory burdens on Plaintiff States, causing direct financial harms.  \n25  200.  To the extent the Corps demands that a State issue a Section 401 certification \n26  decision in an expedited manner (e.g., within days or weeks or risk waiver), this would require \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   47  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 48 of 61\n \n1  a significant diversion of state resources to adequately review and issue a decision on the Section \n2  401 certification request that, if issued, would ensure state water quality standards will be met. \n3  Such a diversion of state resources is unjustified where no emergency exists.  \n4  201.  While the Corps has in some of its Energy Emergency Guidance stated that it will \n5  follow the Section 401 rule time period established by regulation, the Corps’s Energy Emergency \n6  Guidance makes clear that Districts “will not delay a timely response [on the issuance of a \n7  Section 404 permit] because of any standard procedures.” See, e.g., Exhibit I at 4 (Seattle \n8  Guidance).  \n9  202.  But even if the Corps allows States adequate time to conduct Section 401 \n10  certifications, the Plaintiff States will need to pour additional resources into supplementing the \n11  rushed or truncated environmental review by the Corps to ensure that appropriate conditions are \n12  applied to avoid or mitigate harm to aquatic resources from projects approved under emergency \n13  procedures pursuant to the Executive Order. In some cases, where Corps environmental review \n14  is completely absent, Plaintiff States will have to expend their own limited resources conducting \n15  environmental reviews the Corps is legally required to do but, under the command of the \n16  Executive Order, fail to undertake.  \n17  203.  Moreover, requiring States to engage in other agency consultations or prepare \n18  comments on an expedited timeline will also require additional state resources. This has already \n19  occurred in Washington, where the Corps has set seven-day comment periods for complex \n20  projects involving in-water work in critical aquatic habitat. Indeed, in communications with \n21  Washington regulators, the Corps has already acknowledged that the sudden rush to permit \n22  energy-related projects has negative impacts on Washington regulators’ workloads.  \n23  204.  Indeed, Washington strives to work cooperatively with the federal government to \n24  ensure the integrity of Washington’s waters, and Washington and the Corps have a longstanding \n25  practice of cooperatively reviewing project information to meet these objectives when permitting \n26  projects. But the Corps’s decision to use emergency procedures and expedite any permit \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   48  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O.

This  disruption  will  impact  Washington  regulators’  workload  and \n4  workflow, require shifts in priorities, timeline adjustments, and significantly strain capacities \n5  which could lead to delays in fulfilling key responsibilities, reduced quality of output, and \n6  inefficiencies in established processes. \n7  Harms to quasi-sovereign interests \n8  205.  These same harms also impede States’ quasi-sovereign interests “independent of \n9  and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.” Georgia v. \n10  Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U.S. 230, 237 (1907).  \n11  206.  Direct harms to state natural resources, including water quality, water resources, \n12  habitat, and wildlife, directly impact the health and well-being of Plaintiff States’ residents. For \n13  example,  in  Washington,  significant  populations  (including  tribal  populations)  rely  on \n14  Washington’s freshwater and saltwater water bodies for both recreation and sustenance. Impacts \n15  to fish populations from improper use of emergency procedures harms these interests. \n16  207.  The Army Corps’s use of emergency procedures to authorize projects within \n17  Plaintiff States’ jurisdictions undermines the ability of Plaintiff States to protect the quality of \n18  waters within our borders, and correspondingly, the health and well-being of our residents. \n19 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n20 \nCOUNT 1 \n21  Common Law Ultra Vires – Conduct Outside the Scope of \nStatutory Authority Conferred on the Executive \n22  (Against All Defendants) \n23  208.  Plaintiff States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n24  each of the preceding paragraphs.  \n25  209.  Executive agencies and officers, including the President, may not act in excess of \n26  their legal authority. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   49  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 50 of 61\n \n1  210.  A court reviewing executive action has an independent duty to determine what \n2  the law is and whether executive officers invoking statutory authority exceed their statutory \n3  power. See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326 (2015).  \n4  211.  Courts may review a presidential Executive Order and are empowered to enjoin \n5  officers of the Executive Branch from obeying illegal Presidential commands, and may enjoin \n6  ultra vires acts, that is, acts exceeding the officers’ purported statutory authority. Chamber of \n7  Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Sierra Club v. Trump, 379 F. Supp. \n8  3d 883, 909–11 (N.D. Cal. 2019), vacated on other grounds, Biden v. Sierra Club, 142 S. Ct. 56 \n9  (2021). \n10  212.  The NEA only allows the President to unlock emergency powers that Congress \n11  authorized in other statutes. It does not create new emergency powers or enlarge existing ones. \n12  See 50 U.S.C. § 1621(a).  \n13  213.  The NEA requires the President to specify the statutory provisions of law under \n14  which he proposes that he or his officers will act before any emergency authority may be \n15  exercised. 50 U.S.C. § 1631. \n16  214.  While the President purported to specify the statutory provisions of law under \n17  which he proposes that he or his officers will act, none of those provisions provide the President \n18  or any agency with emergency powers or authorities upon a declaration of a national energy \n19  emergency under the NEA as set out in the Executive Order.  \n20  215.  The President has acted ultra vires by directing agencies to invoke emergency \n21  procedures to evade or shorten technical and/or environmental review under circumstances \n22  that—as a matter of law—do not qualify as an emergency under applicable statutory and \n23  regulatory provisions.  \n24  216.  The Corps has acted contrary to law and ultra vires by, among other things, \n25  implementing the Executive Order’s directive to issue Clean Water Act Section 404 permits on \n26  an expedited or emergency.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   50  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 51 of 61\n \n1  217.  The ACHP has acted contrary to law and ultra vires by, among other things, \n2  implementing the Executive Order’s directive to conduct consultations with regard to historic \n3  preservation, pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, 54 U.S.C. § 306108, with regard to historic \n4  preservation on an emergency basis, and extending such emergency treatment to last for the \n5  indeterminate duration of the Executive Order’s declared emergency. \n6  218.  For these reasons, Plaintiff States are entitled to a declaration that Defendants’ \n7  use  of  emergency  procedures  is  unlawful,  and  that  the  Court  should  enjoin  Defendants’ \n8  implementation of the Executive Order. \n9  COUNT 2 \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 – Contrary to Law \n10 \n(Against Corps Defendants) \n11  219.  Plaintiff States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n12  each of the preceding paragraphs.  \n13  220.  The Corps is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n14  221.  The APA provides that this Court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside” agency \n15  action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not otherwise in accordance with \n16  law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n17  222.  Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the agency fails to interpret \n18  and implement the statutory language consistent with the statute’s text, structure, and purpose.  \n19  223.  Agency  action  is  also  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  if  agency  action  is \n20  inconsistent with applicable federal regulations. \n21  224.  The Corps’s actions in utilizing emergency procedures to fulfill the President’s \n22  directive in the Executive Order directly contravenes the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et \n23  seq., and other applicable statutes because those statutes do not authorize emergency action \n24  under the circumstances described in the Executive Order.  \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   51  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 52 of 61\n \n1  225.  The Corps’s actions in utilizing emergency procedures to fulfill the President’s \n2  directive  in  the  Executive  Order  directly  contravenes  the  Corps’s  emergency  procedures \n3  regulation set out at 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(e). \n4  226.  The  Corps’s  decision  to  implement  “emergency  procedures”  represents  the \n5  consummation of their decision-making process on how to effectuate the President’s directive \n6  in the Executive Order and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n7  227.  As a result, the Corps’s actions must be set aside as not in accordance with law.  \n8  COUNT 3 \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 – Arbitrary and Capricious \n9 \n(Against Corps Defendants) \n10  228.  Plaintiff States reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \n11  each of the preceding paragraphs.  \n12  229.  The Corps is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  \n13  230.  The APA provides that this Court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside” agency \n14  action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not otherwise in accordance with \n15  law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n16  231.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails to consider important \n17  factors, considers issues that Congress did not intend for it to consider, or fails to articulate a \n18  reasoned explanation for the action. \n19  232.  When the Corps invoked emergency procedures to permit projects under Clean \n20  Water Act Section 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, it was required to consider the objective of the Clean \n21  Water Act. \n22  233.  The Clean  Water Act’s objective is to “restore and maintain the chemical, \n23  physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).  \n24  234.  The protection of water quality is the paramount interest the Corps must consider \n25  when executing its permitting authority under Clean Water Act Section 404. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY   52  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEcology Division \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1125 Washington St. SE \nP.O. Box 40100 \nOlympia, WA 98504 \n(360) 753-6200 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00869     Document 1     Filed 05/09/25     Page 53 of 61\n \n1  235.  The  Corps  failed  to  consider  how  impacts  to  water  quality  resulting  from \n2  permitting without proper environmental review undermine, rather than further, the Clean Water \n3  Act’s objective of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of \n4  the Nation’s waters. \n5  236.  When the Corps invoked emergency procedures to permit projects under Clean \n6  Water  Act  Section  404,  33  U.S.C.  §  1344,  it  was  required  to  consider,  for  each  permit \n7  application, whether there was an emergency within the meaning of 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(e)(4). \n8  237.  The Corps failed to consider whether an emergency within the meaning of \n9  33 C.F.R. § 325.2(e)(4) existed to justify use of emergency procedures for hundreds of projects.  \n10  238.  The Corps failed to articulate a reasoned explanation of how the Executive Order \n11  constitutes an emergency within the meaning of 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(e)(4). \n12  239.  The Corps failed to articulate a reasoned explanation of how it can invoke \n13  emergency procedures when the regulatory conditions for invoking those procedures are not met. \n14  240.   In reliance on an Executive Order directing the bypass of critical environmental \n15  protections under a false energy “emergency,” the Corps also relied on factors Congress did not \n16  intend for it to consider. \n17  241.  The  Corps’s  decision  to  implement  “emergency  procedures”  represents  the \n18  consummation of its decision-making process on how to effectuate the President’s directive in \n19  the Executive Order and is therefore a final agency action justiciable under the APA. \n20  242.  The Corps’s  actions as set out herein conflict with the Clean Water Act’s \n21  objective to protect water quality, are arbitrary and capricious, and must be set aside.  \n22  COUNT 4 \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 – Contrary to Law \n23 \n(Against ACHP Defendants) \n24  243.

Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the agency fails to interpret \n5  and implement the statutory language consistent with the statute’s text, structure, and purpose.  \n6  247.  Agency  action  is  also  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  if  agency  action  is \n7  inconsistent with applicable federal regulations. \n8  248.  The ACHP’s actions in utilizing emergency procedures to fulfill the President’s \n9  directive in the Executive Order directly contravenes the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 \n10  U.S.C. §§ 470 et seq., and other applicable statutes because those statutes do not authorize \n11  emergency action under the circumstances described in the Executive Order.  \n12  249.

Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails to consider important \n2  factors, considers issues that Congress did not intend for it to consider, or fails to articulate a \n3  reasoned explanation for the action. \n4  256.  When the ACHP invoked emergency procedures for compliance with Section 106 \n5  of the NHPA for projects permitted pursuant to the Executive Order, 54 U.S.C. § 306108, it was \n6  required to consider the objective of the NHPA. \n7  257.  The NHPA exists to preserve and protect historic and archaeological sites for \n8  present and future generations. 54 U.S.C. § 300101.  \n9  258.  The ACHP failed to consider how impacts to historic and archaeological sites \n10  resulting from permitting pursuant to emergency procedures would undermine, rather than \n11  further, the NHPA’s objective of preserving and protecting historic and archaeological sites.  \n12  259.  When  the  ACHP  approved  use  of  emergency  procedures  to  comply  with \n13  Section 106 of the NHPA to permit projects pursuant to the Executive Order, it was required to \n14  consider whether there was an emergency within the meaning of 36 C.F.R. § 800.12. \n15  260.
