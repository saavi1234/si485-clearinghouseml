    "summary": "<p>This is a proposed class action challenging the Trump administration's near-dissolution of the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program. On April 7, 2025, a coal miner filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary. Represented by private counsel, the Plaintiff challenged the termination of HHS employees overseeing the screening and job transfer programs related to coal mine dust lung disease (CMDLD). The Plaintiff, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated coal miners, argued that the termination of these HHS employees endangered him and other coal miners and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Irene Cornelia Berger.</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding procedural due process claims and moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The court held an evidentiary hearing on May 7 and on May 13 issued a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1384768. The court found that the plaintiff had standing, since as \"an active coal miner with diagnosed black lung, he is within the group intended to be protected by the Mine Act and Part 90, and he is among those served by the CWHSP at NIOSH,\" and is therefore harmed by the elimination of those services. The court found that through the elimination of the vast majority of employees at the Respiratory Health Division (RHD) and the CWSHP, the agencies had been shut down, constituting final agency action reviewable under the APA. The court then found the defendants' actions to be arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law under the APA. Under the Mine Act and associated regulations, HHS is required to \"to provide medical examinations to screen for black lung, to evaluate chest radiographs and spirometry tests, to issue Part 90 findings to miners with signs of black lung, to maintain a mobile health unit that travels to mines and mining communities, to maintain the B-Reader program, and to provide chest autopsies to examine for black lung in deceased miners.\" However, with the terminations of the employees, HHS was not fulfilling those obligations. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiff had established a strong likelihood of success on the merits of his APA claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The injunction requires restoration of all personnel and continuation of the miner health programs at issue. The court also ordered that, in the event of a reorganization at HHS, there be no pause in the protections mandated by statute. The court did not address class certification. On June 17, the court set a schedule for the case going forward. However, on July 9, the plaintiff asked the court for leave to file an amended complaint. The court has not yet ruled on the request.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2025, the court granted plaintiff&rsquo;s motion to file an amendment complaint, which plaintiff filed the same day. Plaintiffs wanted to amend the complaint to &ldquo;include miners who do not yet have evidence of pneumoconiosis but are entitled to screening.&rdquo; 2025 WL 2375205. Defendants moved to dismiss this complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On September 11, 2025 defendants filed a motion seeking a protective order. Plaintiffs filed a reply in which they said defendants &ldquo;display an almost shocking level of hubris&rdquo; while discussing Defendants lack of cooperation during discovery. The court denied defendant&rsquo;s motion for a protective order and ordered them to comply with plaintiff&rsquo;s discovery requests within 10 days. The following day, on October 1, 2025, defendants filed a motion to hold this civil matter in abeyance due to the lapse of congressional appropriations due to the government shut down. The court granted this request on October 7.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

Civil Action No. 2:25-cv-227 \n \nROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., in his \nofficial capacity as Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, and \nUS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND \nHUMAN SERVICES  \n \nDefendants. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PROTECTIVE ORDER \nINTRODUCTION \n  In filing their motion for a protective order Defendants display an almost shocking level of \nhubris,  ignoring  nearly  all  of  the  developments  in  this  case  and  the  Court’s  prior  Orders. \nDefendants act as if the Court has already granted their Second Motion to Dismiss and treat these \nproceedings as nothing more than an annoyance—despite the fact that they are currently subject \nto an injunction issued by the Court.  \nA Scheduling Order is in effect, which established the last date for the filing of discovery \nrequests as August 13, 2025. [ECF Doc. # 46.] Accordingly, Plaintiffs served requests for answers \nto interrogatories, production of documents, and admissions on the 13th. [ECF Doc. # 57.] The \nclose of discovery was established as September 26, 2025. Despite this filing, on the last day \navailable, and the upcoming close of discovery date, Defendants have not only refused to answer \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 72     Filed 09/25/25     Page 2 of 9 PageID #: 1585\nbut have accused Plaintiffs of engaging in premature discovery. (Defs.’ Mot. for Protective Order \nat 2, 8–9 [ECF Doc. # 69].) \nDefendants position that discovery is inappropriate because this is a proceeding under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act is in complete disregard for the Court’s prior ruling in issuing the \nScheduling Order. Defendants took the same position in the joint 26(f) Report, filed on June 16, \n2025, and the Court rejected that position when it issued the Scheduling Order. (Compare Rpt. of \nParties’ Planning Meeting [ECF Doc. # 45] with Scheduling Order [ECF Doc. # 46].) Since the \nissuance of the Scheduling Order, Defendants have not made any motion to stay or alter it. \nMoreover, while asserting that this case should be decided solely on an administrative record, \nDefendants have failed to submit or even proffer a timeline for the submission of such record. \nDespite the Defendants’ feelings about this matter, it is proceeding as a typical civil action–\ncomplete with rights to discovery–and that fact will not change unless and until the Court issues a \nnew Scheduling Order.   \nAdditionally,  Defendants  inappropriately  proffer  that  they  “have  demonstrated  that \nPlaintiffs do not have standing to pursue their APA claim.” (Defs.’ Mot. for Protective Order at 7.) \nThis statement and several others expressing the same sentiment ignore the fact that the only \nfindings of the Court on Plaintiffs’ standing have been favorable to the Plaintiff.  (See Mem Op. & \nOrder at 14-17 (May 13, 2025) [ECF Doc. # 36]; Mem. Op. & Order at 2-3 (Aug. 14, 2025) [ECF \nNo. 58].)  \nDefendants refuse to participate in the progress of this matter and continue to rely on \npreviously rejected defenses to the detriment of Plaintiffs. Defendants’ Motion for a Protective \nOrder is not targeted to specific categories or requests, but seeks to eliminate Plaintiffs’ right to \ndiscovery in its entirety. They refuse to disclose even a single document. Defendants’ have taken \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 72     Filed 09/25/25     Page 3 of 9 PageID #: 1586\nsuch a stance despite the imminent close of discovery and upcoming deadline for dispositive \nmotions and have impeded upon Plaintiffs’ ability to develop a Motion for Class Certification. \nLastly, Defendants have made it exceedingly difficult for Plaintiffs to even determine whether \nDefendants are in compliance with the Court’s Preliminary Injunction Order, issued on May 13th \nof this year. [ECF Doc. # 36.]   \nFor all of these reasons, the Protective Order should be denied.    \nARGUMENT \n  As a general rule, protective orders “should be sparingly used and cautiously granted. Roe \nv. Marshall U. Bd. of Governors, 2024 WL 388412 at *3 (S.D. W. Va. Jan. 31, 2024). The “party \nseeking a protective order has the burden of establishing ‘good cause’ by demonstrating that \n‘specific prejudice or harm will result if no protective order is granted.’” Black v. West Virginia \nState Police, 2023 WL 4834948 at *5 (S.D. W. Va. July 27, 2023) (citing U.S. ex rel. Davis v. \nPrince, 753 F. Supp. 2d 561, 565 (E.D. Va. 2010)). Here, Defendants’ only effort to establish “good \ncause” is their unilateral belief that their pending motion to dismiss will be granted and their desire \nto avoid discovery in the normal course. That proffer is woefully insufficient for the sweeping \nprohibition on discovery that they seek.  \nI.  The Court Already Determined that Discovery Should Take Place. \nDefendants’ first argument in support of its motion for protective order is that the case is \ngoverned by the Administrative Procedure Act and therefore should be adjudicated based on an \nadministrative record. These arguments are inappropriate at this stage of litigation and have already \nbeen rejected by the Court. While claiming Plaintiffs cannot make a showing of a need for \ndiscovery  beyond  the  administrative  record,  Defendants’  conveniently  ignore  the  fact  that \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 72     Filed 09/25/25     Page 4 of 9 PageID #: 1587\ndiscovery closes on September 26th, dispositive motions are due on October 27th, and they have \nnot made any proffer of documents or even a deadline for production of any administrative record. \nDefendants’ arguments regarding discovery under the Administrative Procedure Act are \nsubstantially similar to those they submitted in support of a case on the administrative record in \nthe jointly submitted 26(f) Report and the relief they seek is identical. (See Rpt. of Parties’ Planning \nMeeting at 2, ¶ 4.a.  (“[Because this case falls under the APA] the Court should decline to authorize \ndiscovery in this case, and should instead set a briefing schedule for cross-motions for summary \njudgment and cross-replies.”) (Ex. 1).). The Court rejected  that  position when it entered a \nScheduling Order allowing Parties an opportunity for discovery. (See Scheduling Order [ECF Doc. \n# 46].)  \n“[A] scheduling order under Rule 16(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ‘is not a \nfrivolous piece of paper, idly entered, which can be cavalierly disregarded[.] Johnson v. W. Va. Bd. \nof Governors, 2023 WL 2486952 at *3 (S.D.W. Va. Feb. 13, 2023) (citing Henley v. FMC Corp., \n172 F.R.D. 193, 198 n.6 (S.D.W. Va. 1997)). “Rather a scheduling order is the critical path chosen \nby the Court and the parties to fulfill the mandate of Rule 1 in securing the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action.” Id. (cleaned up). Through their filing of this motion, \nDefendants seek to unilaterally upend the Court’s scheduling order and chosen path for the \nresolution of this case. Notably, Defendants took this action not at the outset of discovery, but at \nits close, putting Plaintiffs in the difficult position of proceeding to the development of critical \nmotions without the benefit of any documents from Defendants, aside from those they have \nthemselves chosen to attach as exhibits to their motions.  \n  While arguing that this case should be decided on an administrative record, Defendants \nhave failed to proffer one. Defendants have attached certain self-selected documents to motions as \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 72     Filed 09/25/25     Page 5 of 9 PageID #: 1588\nevidence in support of their position. This, however, is in no way equivalent to supplying a true \nadministrative record. Such a record would include “the facts presented to the agency” and “the \nreasons given by the agency for taking the action.” Dow Agrosciences, LLC, v. Nat. Marine \nFisheries Serv., 707 F.3d 462, 467–68 (4th Cir. 2013).  “The whole administrative record includes \npertinent but unfavorable information, and an agency may not exclude information on the ground \nthat it did not ‘rely’ on that information in its final decision.” Tafas v. Dudas, 530 F. Supp. 2d 786, \n793 (E.D. Va. 2008) (collecting cases). Defendants have provided nothing of the sort in this case \nand  are  now  attempting  to  prevent  Plaintiffs  from  obtaining  relevant  information  through \ndiscovery.  \n  Defendants appear to view the grant of filing of the Second Amended Complaint as a rest \nof this matter. (See, e.g., Mot. for Protective Order at 2 (“the Court recently reset the procedural \nposture of this case by granting Plaintiff Wiley’s request for leave to amend his complaint and \nordering  the  filing  of  the  Second Amended  Complaint.”).)  Plaintiffs,  however,  filed  their \namendment within the deadlines ordered by the Court and without a request for a modification of \nthe schedule. While Defendants’ refusal to participate meaningfully in this matter beyond the \nreassertion of jurisdictional arguments may very well necessitate a modification of the schedule—\nPlaintiffs’ counsel are aware of no authority that the filing of an amended complaint within the \nspecified deadlines automatically vacates the Court’s Scheduling Order and resets a case to its \nbeginning. Defendants have provided no authority for such position and made no motion for \nmodification of the scheduling order.  \nII.  Written Discovery is Appropriate Unless and Until the Court Grants Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss. \n \nDefendants’ second argument largely rests on their confidence in the success of their \npending motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Defs.’ Mot. for Protective Order at 7 (“As demonstrated by \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 72     Filed 09/25/25     Page 6 of 9 PageID #: 1589\nDefendants’ previously submitted evidence, which is incontrovertible, Plaintiffs jurisdictional \nallegations regarding their standing . . . are wholly unsubstantial.”). In making such an assertion, \nDefendants conveniently ignore that the Court already issued rulings on each of the jurisdictional \nchallenges they have presented. (See Mem. Op. & Order at 17, 18, 22-23 [ECF Doc. # 36].) While \nDefendants place great weigh on their standing arguments—they have already conceded in their \nReply to their own Motion to Dismiss that standing is determined at the time an action commences. \n(Defs.’ Reply in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot to Dismiss at 2 [ECF Doc. # 71].) They also concede that this \nCourt already determined that one Plaintiff, Mr. Wiley, “is likely to establish that he has standing \nto pursue his claims” based on evidence supplied at the preliminary injunction hearing. (Id. at 2 \n(quoting Mem. Op. & Order at 16) (emphasis in original).)  \nDefendants proffer that the burden to establish standing for purposes of a motion to dismiss, \nthough evaluated at the same time as the determination on a preliminary injunction, is somehow \nhigher. That is not true. Indeed, it is lower: \nThe evidentiary burden for establishing Article III standing for the purposes of a \nmotion  for a  preliminary  injunction  is  at  least  as  onerous  as  the  burden  for \nestablishing standing to secure a summary judgment. Cacchillo v. Insmed, Inc., 638 \nF.3d 401, 404 (2d Cir. 2011)). The burden for establishing standing at the dismissal \nstage is lower. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (to establish \nstanding at the pleading stage, “general factual allegations of injury resulting from \nthe defendant's conduct may suffice”). \n \nDo  No  Harm  v.  Pfizer  Inc.,  126  F.4th  109,  113–14  (2d  Cir.  2025).  While  in  the  correct \ncircumstances—notably at the outset of litigation—it may be appropriate to disallow discovery \nbefore resolving jurisdictional issues, it would be inappropriate here. Discovery has already \ncommenced and the disallowance of discovery would largely be based on a Defendants’ unilateral \n– albeit misplaced – confidence in their own motion. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 72     Filed 09/25/25     Page 7 of 9 PageID #: 1590\nIII.  Plaintiffs Service of Discovery Was Timely  \nAgain, Defendants’ argument relies on the unsupported assumption that Plaintiffs’ filing of \nthe Second Amended Complaint automatically reset all of the deadlines in this case. Again, \nPlaintiffs are unaware of any such authority, have proceeded to comply with the dates and \ndeadlines in the current scheduling order, and intend to continue to do so unless and until a \nmodified scheduling order is entered. If Defendants wish to reset or modify deadlines, Defendants \nshould make a motion to the Court after conferring with Plaintiffs. That has not happened in \nadvance of the filing of the Motion for Protective Order. Indeed, given Defendants’ refusal to \nengage in discovery and the resulting delay, it may be necessary to modify upcoming deadlines. \nHowever, Plaintiffs are not convinced that any possible modification would require a full-scale \nreset of this case to its initial stages. Granting the requested protective order on the basis of \nDefendants’ unsupported view of the posture of this case is not appropriate.  \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ Discovery Requests Are Limited to the Claims and Defenses Asserted in \nThis Case.  \n \nWithout pointing to any specific request as going beyond the bounds of proportionality in \nthis case, Defendants generally argue that matters relating to the Mining Research Division and \nthe agency’s budget are outside the scope of this matter. That is simply wrong.   \nAs to the Mining Research Division, such claims were properly and clearly added when \nthe Court granted leave for Plaintiffs to file their Second Amended Complaint. Paragraphs 44 \nthrough 47 all include descriptions of research and approval functions of this division, including \nthe following: \n  Review and approval of devices for sampling of respirable dust, (Para. 44) \n  Identification of toxic substances in response to requests, (Para. 45)  \n  Review and approval of devices for sampling of coal and silica dust (Para. 46) \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 72     Filed 09/25/25     Page 8 of 9 PageID #: 1591\n  Research and support functions appurtenant to respirable dust research and device \napproval. (Para 47). \nWhile Defendants may not like the inclusion of these claims, they are part of the case. There is no \njustification for preventing discovery on relevant issues.  \n  As for the requests for discovery on the agency’s budget, those requests relate directly to \nDefendants’ illegal impoundment of funds. That claim has been part of this case since the filing of \nthe First Amended Complaint on April 21, 2025. (See First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25, 41–42 [ECF Doc. \n# 10].) They were included as well in the Second Amended Complaint. (Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 43, \n64–65  [ECF  Doc.  #  59].)  Defendants,  therefore,  have  not  identified  any  justification  for \ndisallowing discovery related to their budget.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  reasons  explained  above,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  deny \nDefendants’ motion for entry of a protective order. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nHARRY  WILEY  and  MATTHEW \nWARD, individually and on behalf of all \nothers similarly situated,  \nBy counsel: \n \n  /s/ Samuel B.

CIVIL ACTION NO.  2:25-cv-00227 \n \nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., in his official \ncapacity as Secretary of Health and Human  \nServices, and U.S. DEPARTMENT OF  \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \n \nThe  Court  has  reviewed  the  Plaintiff’s  Motion  for  Leave  to  File  Second  Amended \nComplaint  (Document  47),  the  attached  Second  Amended  Complaint  (Document  47-1),  the \nPlaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint \n(Document 48), the Defendants’ Response in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File \nSecond Amended Complaint (Document 52), the Defendants’ Motion to Seal Attachments A and \nB to Exhibit 1 to Defendants’ Response in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Second \nAmended Complaint (Document 53) (sealed), and the Plaintiff’s Reply in Support of Motion for \nLeave to File Second Amended Complaint (Document 54). \nThe Plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint to add an additional Plaintiff and proposed class \nrepresentative, simplify the class definition, and more fully describe the mandatory duties to coal \nminers that the Defendants are alleged to have violated.  The original proposed class included “all \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 58     Filed 08/14/25     Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 1262\ncoal miners who show evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis and thus are seeking \neligibility as Part 90 miners or who are entitled to seek a job transfer under Part 90.”  (Document \n48  at  2.)    The  Plaintiffs  now  seek  to  include  miners  who  do  not  yet  have  evidence  of \npneumoconiosis but are entitled to screening.  The Second Amended Complaint therefore defines \nthe class as “all coal miners who are or have been employed at mines within the jurisdiction of the \nMine Act, 30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.”  (Id.)  The Plaintiffs note that the Defendants, as well as the \nU.S. Department of Labor, already have methods of communicating with the membership of the \nproposed class.  They contend that the proposed amendment would not cause delay, is made in \ngood faith, is not prejudicial to the Defendants, and would not be futile.   \nThe Defendants oppose the motion to amend.    They argue that the Plaintiff lacked \nstanding at the outset of the case and continues to lack standing, and the proposed second named \nPlaintiff likewise lacks standing. They further argue that the Plaintiff’s claims are now moot \nbecause the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) “has provided Plaintiff with \nall services to which he is entitled.”  (Document 52 at 4.)  They assert that “the proposed second \nplaintiff also has no injury in fact for this Court to remedy,” as the CWHSP has evaluated his \nmedical records and reached a determination regarding his eligibility for a job transfer under Part \n90.  The Defendants contend that neither proposed Plaintiff can serve as class representatives, \ngiven their lack of standing. \nRule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure encourages Courts to freely grant \nmotions for leave to amend pleadings “when justice so requires.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  “A \ndistrict court may deny a motion to amend when the amendment would be prejudicial to the \nopposing party, the moving party has acted in bad faith, or the amendment would be futile.”  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 58     Filed 08/14/25     Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 1263\nEqual Rights Ctr. v. Niles Bolton Associates, 602 F.3d 597, 603 (4th Cir. 2010).  “Motions to \namend are typically granted in the absence of an improper motive, such as undue delay, bad faith, \nor repeated failure to cure a deficiency by amendments previously allowed.”  Harless v. CSX \nHotels, Inc., 389 F.3d 444, 447 (4th Cir. 2004).  “Futility is apparent if the proposed amended \ncomplaint fails to state a claim under the applicable rules and accompanying standards.”  Katyle \nv. Penn Nat. Gaming, Inc., 637 F.3d 462, 471 (4th Cir. 2011). \nThe Plaintiff’s motion to amend was timely filed within the deadline established in the \nScheduling Order (Document 46) for filing amended pleadings.  The Defendants do not assert \nthat the amendment would be prejudicial or that the Plaintiffs have acted in bad faith.  The Court \nfinds that the proposed amendment is not futile.  In addressing the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in this matter, the Court found that the Plaintiff had established a likelihood of success \non the merits, including standing.  The proposed amendment does not alter that conclusion.  The \nCourt’s finding regarding futility herein is not intended to be a substitute for review of a motion to \ndismiss, which the Court notes the Defendant filed on August 6, 2025.1 \nWherefore, after careful consideration, the Court ORDERS that the Plaintiff’s Motion for \nLeave to File Second Amended Complaint (Document 47) be GRANTED, and that the attached \nSecond Amended Complaint (Document 47-1) be FILED. The Court further ORDERS that the \nDefendants’ Motion to Seal Attachments A and B to Exhibit 1 to Defendants’ Response in \nOpposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint (Document 53) \n \n1 While a proposed amended complaint that fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) or otherwise does not comply \nwith the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure can be rejected as futile, see, e.g., U.S. ex rel. Wilson v. Kellogg Brown & \nRoot, Inc., 525 F.3d 370, 376 (4th Cir. 2008), the Court finds that judicial economy and fairness to the parties will be \nbetter served in this case by saving a full analysis of any defenses for a fully briefed motion to dismiss, given that the \nCourt has not yet addressed a motion to dismiss.    \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 58     Filed 08/14/25     Page 4 of 4 PageID #: 1264\n(sealed) be GRANTED, finding that the Plaintiffs’ privacy interest in the medical records \ncontained therein substantially outweighs any public interest in those documents.   \nIn light of the filing of the second amended complaint, the Court ORDERS that the \nfollowing motions related to the amended complaint, which is no longer the active pleading in this \nmatter, be TERMINATED AS MOOT:  the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Document 14), the \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Demand for a Jury Trial (Document 17), the Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Leave to File Sur-Reply to Defendants’ Reply in Support of Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss (Document 42), and the Defendants’ Motion to Allow Reply in Support of Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss (ECF No. 41) to Be Filed Out of Time and Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Leave to File Sur-Reply to Defendants’ Reply in Support of Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss (ECF No. 42) (Document 43).   \nThe Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and to \nany unrepresented party. \nENTER:    August 14, 2025 \n \n \n4 \n ",

KENNEDY, JR., in his \nofficial capacity as Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, and         \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \n \n  Defendant. \n \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n1.  Coal miners face some of the greatest hazards of all American workers, including \na recent epidemic of advanced coal mine dust lung disease (“CMDLD”) as miners cut sandstone \nto reach the heavily depleted thin-seam coal reserves that remain after a hundred years of mining \nin Appalachia. In order to prevent black lung from developing into totally-disabling progressive \nmassive fibrosis, the federal mine safety statutes since 1969 have afforded American coal miners \na medical screening and epidemiological surveillance program, along with a unique right to \ntransfer to a non-dusty job if they begin developing early signs of occupational lung disease.   \n2.  With no advance notice, on April 1, 2025, Defendant terminated most of the critical \nemployees, including the chief medical officer, overseeing the CMDLD screening and job transfer \n1 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 2 of 15 PageID #: 154\nprograms, thus jeopardizing miners---like the Plaintiff, Mr. Wiley---who seek to utilize these \ncritical and time-sensitive protections from continued dust exposure and debilitating disease. \n3.  The Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, has long provided both \na health screening program to detect disease and the associated right to transfer upon detection of \nblack lung. See generally 30 U.S.C. § 843. The epidemiology program is known as the Coal \nWorkers’ Health Surveillance Program (“CWHSP”). The job transfer program is known in the \nmining industry by the name of its implementing regulation, “Part 90.” 30 C.F.R. Part 90. \n4.  The utilization of Part 90 has increased roughly tenfold in the past few years as \nminers became aware of increasingly severe CMDLD in Central Appalachia. So the need for \naccess to this program is urgent and growing in the face of severe hazards of exposure to respirable \ncrystalline silica dust from the mining of sandstone to reach thin coal seams.  \n5.  For these reasons, NOW COMES Plaintiff, Harry Wiley, on behalf of himself and \nothers similarly situated, and brings this Class Action Complaint for declaratory judgment and \ninjunctive relief against Defendant---the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its \nSecretary, Mr. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.---seeking a declaration that Defendants comply with their \nstatutory duties under 30 U.S.C. § 843 (requiring examinations of coal miners and affording job \ntransfer  rights);  30  U.S.C.  §  811(a)(7)  (providing  authority  for  examinations  of  all  miners \ngenerally); 30 U.S.C. § 811(a)(9) (anti-backsliding provisions providing that no Administration \nmay weaken protections for miners); and with the requirements of their own existing regulations, \n30 C.F.R. Part 90, and cease depriving him of due process of law, by restoring all personnel in the \nRespiratory Health Division of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health who are \nintegral to carrying out the epidemiological surveillance and job transfer provisions of the Mine \nSafety and Health Act of 1977. \n2 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 3 of 15 PageID #: 155\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims is founded on the existence of a federal question.  \nThis action arises under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706, and the Fifth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, and jurisdiction is conferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n(federal question).  \n7.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because this District \nis where Plaintiff works and therefore, where a substantial portion of the events or omissions giving \nrise to this action occurred. \n8.  This Court is empowered to grant declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2201 (declaratory judgment), 28 U.S.C. § 2202 (injunctive relief), and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706, for \nviolations of, inter alia, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706, and because \nthe Department’s actions are contrary to the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff Harry Wiley was at all times relevant a resident of Kanawha County, West \nVirginia. \n10.  At all relevant times, Mr. Wiley was employed as a coal miner within Kanawha \nCounty in the Southern District of West Virginia.  \n11.  At all relevant times, Defendants conducted operations of the CWHSP and Part 90 \nthroughout the Southern District of West Virginia. \n12.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services contains the National \nInstitute of Occupational Safety and Health (“NIOSH”), within which the Respiratory Health \nDivision operates the CWHSP and Part 90 programs. \n3 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 4 of 15 PageID #: 156\n13.  Defendant Mr. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nOverview of NIOSH’s Coal Miner Health Programs: Background. \n1.  In the federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (the “CMHSA”), Congress \nestablished a program for monitoring the lung function of America’s coal miners and affording \nthem the right to transfer to a low-dust job if they began developing black lung disease. See 30 \nU.S.C. § 843. This program is commonly known by the name of its implementing regulation, “Part \n90.” 30 C.F.R. Part 90. \n2.  The statute directs the low-dust job transfer program to be located within the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. 30 U.S.C. § 843. The CMHSA was amended by the \nfederal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”), which expanded miners’ rights and \npreserved the rights in the CMHSA.  \n3.  NIOSH  and  the  Mine  Safety  and  Health  Administration  have  utilized  these \nprovisions of the Mine Act to continually improve protections for miners in the coal and other \nmineral mining industries---always improving and never rescinding the degree of protections \nprovided under the law. Indeed, the Mine Act contains an anti-backsliding provision. See 30 U.S.C. \n§ 811(a)(9) (providing that no Administration may weaken protections for miners); 30 U.S.C. § \n811(a)(7) (providing authority for examinations of all miners generally). \n4.  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 established NIOSH as the research \nwing of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, augmenting the statutory mandate for \nthe Respiratory Health Division within NIOSH that carries out both the OSH Act and Mine Act. \nSee 29 U.S.C. § 671; Pub. L. No. 91-596, § 22 (1970). \n4 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 157\n5.  Following the Sago Mine Disaster in 2006, Congress permanently established \nNIOSH’s Office of Mine Safety and Health to advance the technology-forcing health and safety \nprotections of the Mine Act. See 29 U.S.C. § 671(h); MINER Act, Pub. L. No. 109-236, §6 (2006) \n(amending section 22 of the OSH Act); see also 30 U.S.C. § 863(b) (Mine Act requires coal mine \noperators to maintain ventilation controls in all work areas sufficient “to reduce the level of \nrespirable dust to the lowest attainable level”). \n6.  Among many other things, NIOSH recommends criteria for lifesaving workplace \nhealth and safety standards; investigates workplace outbreaks and safety crises at the request of \nemployers and workers and provides recommendations and guidance for making workplaces safe \nand healthy; certifies experts qualified to analyze chest X-rays of black lung claimants against \nglobal standards for assessing the extent of lung damage; operates a periodic mobile black lung \nclinic to provide miners chest exams, free of charge; enables research into injuries and deaths of \nchildren engaged in farmwork; provides estimates of work-related exposures to radiation to enable \nthe Department of Labor to assess the eligibility of workers in the nation’s nuclear weapons \nprogram for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 \n(EEOICPA) compensation for their cancers and other diseases; incentivizes the development of \nnew mine safety technologies and tests them in real-world mining environments; leads the nation’s \nlargest initiative to track and understand the incidence of cancer among the nation’s firefighters; \nand, through its National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (PPT Lab), advances the \nscience and effective use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), such as respirators, footwear \ncovers, and eye protection, on which 20 million workers (including one million firefighters) rely. \nPart 90 Application Process \n5 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 6 of 15 PageID #: 158\n7.  There are two means by which miners may apply for protection under Part 90. See \ngenerally 42 C.F.R. § 37.100-103; 30 C.F.R. § 90.3, 90.102, 90.102T. \n8.  First, the miner may participate in the screening program provided by his or her \ncoal mine employer under the Mine Act, which will automatically submit the results to NIOSH.  \n42 C.F.R. § 37.100. Underground coal mine operators should either have a NIOSH approved plan \nfor medical examinations under Section 203(a) of the Act and 42 C.F.R. Part 37 or comply with a \nwritten notice of arrangements for medical examinations that were made by NIOSH. In either \ninstance, the operator is required to post the approved plan or NIOSH Notice for medical \nexaminations on the mine bulletin board. \n9.  Second, and in the alternative, miners may submit an application to the NIOSH \nCWHSP providing evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis that they have developed at \ntheir own expense. See 42 C.F.R. § 37.103. NIOSH will evaluate the evidence in the same manner \nas if it were submitted under the operator’s plan or the NIOSH arrangements. This is the means by \nwhich Mr. Wiley applied for Part 90. \n10.  After interpretation of a miner’s chest x-ray, NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division \ninforms the miner of any rights he or she may have under Part 90 and includes a copy of the NIOSH \nreport of medical findings in a letter to the miner. If the interpretation reveals evidence of \npneumoconiosis, the miner also receives a form that is to be used to exercise the option to work in \na low-dust area of a mine. If the findings from NIOSH show evidence of the development of \npneumoconiosis, the miner will be awarded the right to exercise the Part 90 option. \n11.  Once an eligible miner exercises his or her job transfer right, they retain the right \nto rescind the exercise of that right and re-exercise it at any point later in their career so long as \n6 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 159\nthey remain eligible according to NIOSH. See 42 C.F.R. § 37.102; 30 C.F.R. § 90.3, 90.104, \n90.104T (“Waiver of rights; re-exercise of option”). \n12.  After transferring, Part 90 miners are protected by frequent dust sampling to ensure \ncompliance with a reduced coal mine dust exposure limit. \n13.  Congress specifically appropriated funds to NIOSH for carrying out its obligations \nunder the Mine Act and Part 90 in 2024 and 2025. See Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n2024, PL 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 654 (2024); American Relief Act, 2025, PL 118-158, 138 Stat. \n1722 (2024); Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, PL 119-4, 139 Stat. \n4 (2025). \nHarry Wiley Applies for Part 90 in November 2024 \n \n14.  In 2024, Mr. Harry Wiley learned he had developed coal workers’ pneumoconiosis \nor “Black Lung” Disease. \n15.  Black Lung is a latent and progressive disease that has a gradual onset, and becomes \ncompounded with further exposure to hazardous dust.  Early detection and removal of dusty \nhazards is the key to preventing the disease from progressing to the advanced, totally-disabling \nform known as progressive massive fibrosis. \n16.  On November 7, 2024, Mr. Harry Wiley took the initial step in applying for transfer \nto a non-dusty job under Part 90 by completing Form 0920-0020. \n17.  On November 8, 2024, Mr. Wiley mailed the form and a radiographic image of his \nchest by certified mail to the NIOSH Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, 1000 Frederick \nLane M/S LB208, Morgantown, WV 26508.  \n18.  As of the filing of this Complaint, Mr. Wiley has received no response from the \nCWHSP.  \n7 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 8 of 15 PageID #: 160\n19.  Mr. Wiley remains actively employed in underground coal mines, facing daily \nexposures to hazardous coal mine dust that would be prevented by a Part 90 transfer. \nDefendants Terminate NIOSH Coal Workers’ Health Programs \n \n20.  On  March  27,  2025,  workers  at  the  NIOSH  facility  in  Morgantown  (the \n“Morgantown Facility”) received a notice of intent to conduct a reduction in force. \n21.  On April 1, 2025, Defendants notified nearly all employees at the Morgantown \nFacility at 1000 Frederick Lane that they were terminated or placed on administrative leave (the \n“Respiratory Health Division Closure”), including the chief medical officer of the Respiratory \nHealth Division who oversees the CWHSP, the Part 90 evaluation program, and the B-reading \ncertification program.  \n22.  Without the Respiratory Health Division, NIOSH is unable to process all of its \nincoming and pending Part 90 applications such as that of Mr. Wiley. \n23.  On information and belief, because of the Respiratory Health Division Closure, \nDefendants, among other things, are unable to effectively discharge their mandatory statutory \nduties to administer the low-dust job transfer program as required by the Mine Act. \n24.  On information and belief, Defendants have not reallocated the funds that would \nhave provided for the full staffing of the Respiratory Health Division and the carrying out its \nstatutory duties under the Mine Act to any other division of NIOSH or HHS for the purpose of \nimplementing the CWSHP or Part 90 job transfer program. \n25.  On information and belief, Defendants have not made any communications to \nCongress about deferring or rescinding the budgetary authority for the 30 U.S.C. § 843 programs, \nas would be required for an impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. See 2 U.S.C. §§ \n682-88. \n8 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 161\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n26.  Plaintiff brings this action on his own behalf and on behalf of all other similarly \nsituated individuals, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The class \nconsists of all coal miners who show evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis, and thus \nare seeking eligibility as Part 90 miners or who are entitled to seek a job transfer under Part 90. \n27.  The requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied as follows: \n  (a)  The  class  is  numerous,  with  thousands  of  members,  and  joinder  is \nimpracticable due to the high number of putative Class Members, who are geographically \nspread around the region, making their joinder impracticable; \n  (b)   There are questions of law and fact common to all putative Class Members, \nwhich predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, i.e., did the \nRespiratory Health Division Closure prevent miners such as Mr. Wiley and others from \nparticipating in the CWHSP and Part 90 job transfer programs; \n  (c)   The named Plaintiff’s claims are typical of those of the Class as a whole \nbecause the named Plaintiff was deprived of health surveillance and job transfer rights in \nthe same manner as were the rest of the putative Class Members. \n  (d)  The Plaintiff has displayed an interest in vindicating the rights of the Class \nMembers, will fairly and adequately protect and represent the interests of the Class, and is \nrepresented by skillful and knowledgeable counsel. The relief sought by the named Plaintiff \nwill inure to the benefit of the putative Class generally and the named Plaintiff has no \nconflict to pursuing the interests of putative Class Members. \n28.  The requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are also satisfied as follows: \n9 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 162\n  (a)  Prosecuting separate actions by individual putative Class Members would \ncreate a risk of: (1) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual Class \nMembers that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing \nthe Class; or (2) adjudications with respect to individual putative Class Members that, as a \npractical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other Members not parties to \nthe individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect \ntheir interests; and  \n  (b)  Defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole. \nCOUNT I – DECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706   \n \n29.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n30.  A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action or adversely affected or \naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review \nthereof pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n31.  In actions for declaratory judgment under the Administrative Procedure Act, “the \nreviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory \nprovisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action. The \nreviewing court shall (1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed[.]” \n5 U.S.C. § 706(a). \n32.  The Department of Health and Human Services fulfills its twin obligations to \nconduct health surveillance and the job-transfer program under 30 U.S.C. § 843 by operating the \nRespiratory Health Division of NIOSH in Morgantown, West Virginia. \n10 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 11 of 15 PageID #: 163\n33.  By  closing  the  Respiratory  Health  Division,  Defendants  are  violating  their \nnondiscretionary mandatory statutory duties to conduct health surveillance and the job-transfer \nprogram under 30 U.S.C. § 843. \nCOUNT II – VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) – Arbitrary, Capricious, and Unlawful Agency Action \n \n34.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n35.  The APA empowers the Court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n36.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it is not the product of reasoned \ndecision-making. This means, among other things, that an agency must provide an adequate \nevidentiary basis for its action and consider all important aspects of such action. \n37.  Upon request, the Defendants failed to adjudicate Plaintiff’s Part 90 application, \nfailed to issue notice of his right to transfer, and failed to tender an opportunity to be heard on the \neffective denial of these job transfer rights. \n38.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the staff at the Respiratory Health Division and \nthereby stop implementing the mandatory Section 843 programs (CWHSP and Part 90) was \narbitrary and capricious. \n39.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the staff at the Respiratory Health Division and \nthereby stop implementing the CWHSP and Part 90 programs was contrary to law because it \nviolated the Defendants’ duties under the Mine Act. See 30 U.S.C. § 843. \n40.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the staff at the Respiratory Health Division and \nthereby stop implementing the CWHSP and Part 90 was contrary to law because it defied the \n11 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 12 of 15 PageID #: 164\nCongressional appropriation of funds for the CWSHP in 2024 that were continued through the end \nof 2024 and 2025. \n41.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the staff at the Respiratory Health Division and \nthereby stop implementing the CWSHP and Part 90 was contrary to law because it was an \nimpoundment of funds appropriated by Congress and therefore a violation of the Constitutional \nseparation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. \n42.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the staff at the Respiratory Health Division and \nthereby stop implementing the CWHSP and Part 90 was contrary to law because it was an \nimpoundment of funds appropriated by Congress that did not comply with the Impoundment \nControl Act. 2 U.S.C. §§ 682-88. \n43.  Plaintiff has suffered a legal wrong and has been adversely affected and aggrieved \nby the Department’s arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful conduct because he has lost any effective \nmeans by which he can utilize his Part 90 job transfer rights or to undergo x-ray and pulmonary \ntesting again under the CWHSP to re-start a new application, and the Respiratory Health Division \nmust therefore be vacated and permanently enjoined. \nCOUNT III - DEPRIVATION OF PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n(U.S. Constitution, Fifth Amendment) \n \n44.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs by reference. \n45.  Plaintiff possesses important property interests in accessing the CWHSP to monitor \nthe progression of his disease and in transferring to a low-dust job---important, life-saving benefits \nafforded to him and the putative class under 30 U.S.C. § 843. \n46.  Plaintiff is entitled to a legal mechanism within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services that affords him the means of demonstrating his eligibility for a job transfer, and \n12 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 165\na reasonable measure of notice and an opportunity to contest the denial of such transfer rights, as \nwell as meaningful access to the respiratory health monitoring programs of the CWHSP. \n47.  Consistent with the statute, 30 U.S.C. § 843, and regulations 30 C.F.R. Part 90 and \n42 C.F.R. Part 37, the Plaintiff should have received notice of his eligibility to transfer to a low-\ndust job, and a transfer form by which he could notify his employer of his wish to be maintained \nin a low-dust work environment. \n48.  As an active coal miner, Plaintiff also should retain access to participating in the \nCWHSP and, critically, he must have access to obtain his medical records from that program that \nare retained at the RHD in Morgantown. \n49.  The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that “[n]o person shall … \nbe deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” “An essential principle of \ndue process is that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property be preceded by notice and opportunity \nfor hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.” Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. \n532, 542 (1985) (quotations and citations omitted). \n50.  A recipient of a government-dispensed benefit may not be subsequently deprived \nof that benefit without the protections of due process, such as by providing meaningful and \neffective notice regarding how to protest the loss or an alternate means to access the benefits due \nto the beneficiary---such by explaining how Plaintiff could obtain his job transfer and medical \nmonitoring, rather than summarily abandoning his Part 90 claim and closing the CWHSP as \nDefendants have done---and an opportunity to be heard upon the failure to provide the statutorily \nrequired benefits.  Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 267-68 (1970). \n51.  Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fifth Amendment, without \naffording him due process of law, when they closed the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division, failed \n13 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 14 of 15 PageID #: 166\nto adjudicate his Part 90 application, failed to issue notice of his right to transfer, failed to tender \nan opportunity to be heard on the effective denial of these job transfer rights, and shuttered the \nCWHSP that would have afforded him access to periodic pulmonary testing to monitor the \nprogression of his Black Lung disease.  \n52.  Defendants will continue to deprive Plaintiff of due process of law absent the relief \ndemanded in this case. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays that the Court:  \nI.  Declare that Defendants, in arbitrarily, capriciously, and unlawfully failing to fulfill their \nmandatory duties under 30 U.S.C. § 843 and spend the funds appropriated therefore, have \nviolated the Administrative Procedure Act as alleged; \nII.  Declare that Defendants must fully restore the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division in \nMorgantown, West Virginia; \nIII.  Compel Defendant to continue conducting health surveillance through the CWHSP and the \njob-transfer program under 30 U.S.C. § 843 by operating the Respiratory Health Division \nof NIOSH in Morgantown, West Virginia; \nIV.  Award such other equitable or remedial relief as may be appropriate; \nV.  Certify a class of all coal miners in the United States who have evidence of the development \nof pneumoconiosis, and are thus eligible to obtain a job transfer under Part 90; \nVI.  Award to Plaintiff and his attorneys all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ \nand expert witness fees, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(A) and 5 U.S.C. § 702; and  \nVII.  Grant any such other and further relief as this Court may deem equitable and just. \nPLAINTIFF DEMANDS A JURY TRIAL ON ALL ISSUES SO TRIABLE. \n14 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 10     Filed 04/21/25     Page 15 of 15 PageID #: 167\n \n           \n  Respectfully Submitted, \nHARRY WILEY, individually and on behalf \nof all others similarly situated,  \nBy counsel: \n  /s/ Samuel B.

KENNEDY JR., in his official \ncapacity as Secretary of Health and Human  \nServices, and U.S. DEPARTMENT OF  \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \n \nThe Court has reviewed the Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint (Document 10), the Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction (Document 7), the Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Law in Support \nof  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  (Document  8),  the  Defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss \n(Document 14), the Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and \nResponse in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document 22), and the Plaintiff’s \nReply to Defendants’ Response in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document \n25), as well as all exhibits.  The Court held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction \non May 7, 2025, to receive evidence including witness testimony.  For the reasons stated herein, \nthe Court finds that the motion for a preliminary injunction should be granted. \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 2 of 31 PageID #: 900\nFACTS \n  Black lung, or coal workers’ pneumoconiosis,1 is a debilitating, progressive disease caused \nby long-term exposure to coal dust and other mineral dusts in coal mines.  There is no cure for \nblack lung.  Early diagnosis, followed by interventions to limit additional dust exposure, can slow \nor  stop the disease from progressing into more debilitating, advanced forms.    Since 1969, \nCongress has required mine operators and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to \n“mak[e]  available  to  each  miner  working  in  a  coal  mine  the  opportunity  to  have  a  chest \nroentgenogram,” or x-ray, within specified intervals “not to exceed five years.”  30 U.S.C. § 843.  \nTesting now includes spirometry and a respiratory assessment.  42 C.F.R. § 37.92.   \nThe Respiratory Health Division (RHD) within the National Institute for Occupational \nSafety and Health (NIOSH) in Morgantown, West Virginia, is responsible for providing screening \nand reviewing medical examinations submitted by outside providers to determine whether miners \nhave “evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis.”  42 C.F.R. § 37.102(a).  Miners who \nhave evidence of pneumoconiosis may exercise their “Part 90” option to “work in an area of a \nmine” with dust below specified limits.  30 C.F.R. §90.1.   \n  The Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) within the RHD manages the \nagency’s role related to Part 90, in addition to conducting research, outreach, and other work \nrelated to the occupational health risks posed by work in coal mines.  After NIOSH determines \nthat a miner’s medical tests reveal evidence of pneumoconiosis and issues a Part 90 letter detailing \nthe miner’s condition and rights, the miner can enforce his or her rights through the Mine Safety \n \n1 The various witnesses, exhibits, and briefing refer to coal workers’ pneumoconiosis as black lung, occupational \npneumoconiosis, or coal workers’ pneumoconiosis.  The scientific or medical distinctions between the terms are not \nrelevant to the claims presented, and the Court has used the terms interchangeably for purpose of this motion.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 3 of 31 PageID #: 901\nand Health Administration (MSHA) within the Department of Labor.  An outside diagnosis \nwithout the Part 90 letter from NIOSH does not confer the job transfer rights that protect miners \nfrom continued dust exposure.  Only NIOSH offers testing and interpretation of x-rays at no cost \nto miners, and only NIOSH can issue the Part 90 determination.  Miners cannot access Part 90 \nprotections without NIOSH.   \nThe named Plaintiff, Harry Wiley, is employed as a mine electrician in Raleigh County, \nWest Virginia.  He has worked in coal mines for 38 years.  A local clinic diagnosed Mr. Wiley \nwith black lung in November 2024.  He was examined by the Occupational Pneumoconiosis \nBoard of the West Virginia Offices of the Insurance Commissioner on November 19, 2024, and in \nJanuary  2025,  the  Board  determined  that  he  suffered  from  early-stage  occupational \npneumoconiosis, or black lung disease.   \nMr. Wiley submitted a radiographic image to NIOSH in Morgantown, West Virginia, in \nNovember 2024.  Although Mr. Wiley testified that he did not receive a response, despite multiple \nphone calls to NIOSH regarding his application, the Defendants submitted a letter dated December \n10, 2024, stating that a CT scan dated 10/12/2023 did not show findings consistent with black \nlung.  (Defs.’ Attachment K, Document 15-1) (sealed).  The Defendants’ exhibits also indicate \nthat Mr. Wiley received screening through the CWHSP in 2018, with results then indicating no \nevidence of black lung.  As five years has passed since his previous NIOSH provided screening, \nhe is eligible for additional testing.     \nMr. Wiley testified that, had he received the December 2024 letter from NIOSH, he would \nhave submitted additional evidence to verify his black lung diagnosis and secure his Part 90 letter.  \nHe also indicated that he would participate in additional medical screening if the CWHSP were \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 4 of 31 PageID #: 902\noperational to provide such screening.  As an active mine employee with diagnosed black lung, \nhis testimony evinced some urgency about accessing his right to transfer pursuant to Part 90 to \navoid continuing dust exposure.   \nA second coal miner testified that he had been diagnosed with a more advanced case of \nblack lung in March 2025 and submitted a Part 90 application to NIOSH in April on the advice of \nhis healthcare provider.   The testimony from NIOSH employees indicates that NIOSH had \nalready shut down the relevant operations, and that miner stated that he did not receive a return \nreceipt from the application sent via certified mail.  While that miner is currently out on short-\nterm worker’s compensation leave for an unrelated injury, he expects to return to work after \ncompletion of treatment in the coming weeks, and the Part 90 letter would allow him to return to \na low-dust role to avoid further progression of his pneumoconiosis.   \nTwo epidemiologists within the RHD testified, describing their work.  Dr. Anthony Scott \nLaney began working with the CWHSP in 2008.  He studies the causes and consequences of coal-\nrelated respiratory disease.  He led a research team that identified increasing rates of black lung \nin younger miners, information that is important in developing effective interventions and effective \npolicy responses.  His group studies the efficacy of interventions, such as the Part 90 program.  \nHe outlined the types of exposure that impact miners and the types of respiratory diseases that \ndevelop in miners, including silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other \ndiseases as well as black lung.  Dr. Laney explained that scientific studies have confirmed the \nimportance of the Part 90 program: reducing dust exposure reduces the progression of the disease.  \nDr. Laney’s work includes quality control for Part 90 and the B-Reader program, described in \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 5 of 31 PageID #: 903\nmore detail below.  He has received a Reduction in Force (RIF) notice and is currently on \nadministrative leave. \nDr. Noemi Hall testified that her work as a research epidemiologist supports the CWHSP.  \nOne of her recent projects compares when patients begin reporting symptoms, such as shortness \nof breath, to when medical testing through x-rays, labs, and spirometry shows evidence of disease.  \nThe results indicated that screening could identify disease before miners began experiencing \nsymptoms—information that Dr. Hall testified could be shared with miners to encourage them to \nget testing early and often.  She explained that early intervention is crucial for miners to limit \nprogression of the disease.  Dr. Hall also received a RIF notice and is on administrative leave.  \nThe testimony from every witness who worked with black lung repeatedly emphasized \nimportance of early intervention for miners.  They explained that miners with later stages of the \ndisease suffer much more severe debilitation.  One witness recalled carrying retired miners up the \nstairs of the CWHSP mobile unit because their lung function was so limited they could not walk \nup 2-3 stairs.  Another said they frequently struggled to get a complete patient history because \nminers with more advanced or complicated cases of black lung had such difficulty breathing that \nthey could barely speak with providers.  \nIn addition to providing screening for miners and issuing Part 90 letters to miners with \nsigns of black lung, NIOSH developed the B-Reader program for physicians, usually radiologists, \nto gain certification to conduct the specialized reading of a chest x-ray necessary to diagnose black \nlung.  The B-Reader program tests competency for reading x-rays for black lung through an \nexamination  process  with  recertification  every  five  years.    Without  the  CWHSP,  no  new \nphysicians will be certified as B-Readers and existing B-Readers will be unable to recertify.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 6 of 31 PageID #: 904\nThe former coordinator for the RHD and CWHSP at NIOSH, Anita Wolfe, provided \ntestimony based on her 30-year career at NIOSH.  Ms. Wolfe retired in 2020 and continued \ninvolvement as a consultant until recently.  She explained that the core functions of the program \nincluded certifying facilities to provide chest screenings for coal miners, training and certifying \nphysicians to read chest x-rays for occupational lung disease through the B-Reader program, \nconducting public relations and outreach to talk about the programs with miners and mine \noperators, developing and approving mine plans with each coal operator to ensure miners are \nscreened and tracked for black lung, overseeing the Part 90 program, and operating a mobile unit \nfor testing.  She testified that those core functions are necessary to fulfill the mandates of the Mine \nAct.   \nCWHSP processed nearly 5,000 radiographs in fiscal year 2024.  (CWHSP 2024 Fiscal \nRep. at 7, Pl.’s Ex. 5, Document 33-7.)  It also reviewed 1,756 spirometry test results, approved \n226 mine plans, approved 16 new digital radiograph units, and administered 75 B-Reader tests.  \n(Id. at 2, 7-9.)  NIOSH researchers published several articles and gave several presentations on \nvarious topics related to coal workers’ pneumoconiosis.  Ms. Wolfe’s testimony highlighted the \nways in which each function of the CWHSP supported the other mandatory functions: researchers \nused information collected from the field to identify areas of need, and the resulting research \nprovided science based information and data that could be used during outreach to miners and \noperators and also to develop effective interventions. \n The CWHSP mobile unit is a truck equipped for screening miners with x-rays and \nspirometry.  NIOSH personnel bring the mobile unit to remote and underserved locations to reach \nminers who lack an accessible clinic certified to screen for black lung.  NIOSH also brings the \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 7 of 31 PageID #: 905\nmobile unit to events that attract attendance from significant numbers of active and retired coal \nminers.  For example, NIOSH employees completed 105 screenings at the 2024 Mine Rescue \nContest.  (CWHSP 2024 Fiscal Rep. at 4, Pl.’s Ex. 5, Document 33-7.)  Ms. Wolfe testified that \nNIOSH began using the mobile unit in 2003 because of the increase in black lung and the increase \nin rapidly progressing disease.  The mobile unit allowed CWHSP personnel to go to areas where \nthey  identified  rapid  progression  of  the  disease  to  ensure  miners  received  screening.    As \nresearchers identified evidence of increased disease prevalence among surface miners, CWHSP \nbrought the mobile unit to surface mine sites to offer screening as well.   \nBoth Ms. Wolfe and Dr. Laney indicated that all of the NIOSH employees who performed \nduties related to the CWHSP were necessary to maintain the essential functions of the program, \nand the Defendants did not present contrary evidence.  Dr. Laney and Dr. Hall testified that there \nis no other agency in HHS or anywhere in the federal government that does similar work.  Other \ngovernmental programs that address occupational pneumoconiosis among miners, such as the \nBlack Lung Program within the Department of Labor’s Officer of Workers’ Compensation \nPrograms, rely on the work done by the CWHSP at NIOSH.  Dr. Laney also emphasized the level \nof specialization in his role and that of others in the CWHSP.  He has mentored students and post-\ndoctoral candidates who worked at NIOSH, and testified that it took about two years of work in \nthe field to develop adequate familiarity with pneumoconiosis—knowledge that cannot be gained \nin the classroom or through unrelated work experience.  Dr. Laney noted the small group of \npeople involved in black lung research, both within and outside government, describing an annual \nconference of black lung specialists that included researchers, doctors, lawyers, advocates, benefit \nadvisors, and others, that could not fill a conference room.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 8 of 31 PageID #: 906\nDr. Laney, Dr. Hall, and most employees of the RHD at NIOSH received RIF notices on \nor about April 1, 2025, with a termination date of June 2, 2025.  The remaining employees \nreceived RIF notices on May 2, with a termination date of about July 2.  Nearly all employees \nhave been placed on administrative leave.  They were briefly called back to the office on May 5, \nbut then returned to administrative leave, and have been unable to perform their job duties.  Dr. \nLaney’s RIF notice states: “In accordance with President Donald Trump’s Executive Order 14210, \ndated February 11, 2025, and the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) broader \nreorganization strategy to improve its efficiency and effectiveness to make America healthier, \nHHS is executing a Reduction in Force.”  (Laney 3/31/25 RIF, Document 33-3 at 2.)  It states \nthat “this RIF is necessary to reshape the workforce of HHS.”  (Id.)  The RIF notice closes with \na paragraph that includes the following language: “your duties have been identified as either \nunnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.”  (Id. at 6.)  \nDr. Laney and Dr. Hall testified that no work is currently being performed.  There has been no \neffort to preserve projects.  They have received no communication regarding any plan to transition \ntheir work to another agency or new employees, and there is no training program for others to \nperform the highly specialized work done within the RHD.   \nDr. Laney and Dr. Hall stated that they were aware of press releases broadly announcing \nan intent to restructure HHS.  The Defendants introduced those press releases.  The press releases \nindicate that HHS will be downsized from 82,000 to 62,000 full time employees, that 28 divisions \nwill be consolidated into 15 new divisions, “including a new Administration for a Healthy \nAmerica, or AHA,” and regional offices “will be reduced from 10 to 5.”  (3/27/25 HHS Press \nRelease at 1, Document 33-1.)  The press release indicates that NIOSH, among several other \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 9 of 31 PageID #: 907\nagencies, will be centralized into the new “AHA,” which will “focus on areas including Primary \nCare,  Maternal  and  Child  Health,  Mental  Health,  Environmental  Health,  HIV/AIDS,  and \nWorkforce Development.”  (Id. at 3.)  A related fact sheet contains similar information.  Neither \ndocument mentions the RHD, the CWHSP, black lung, Part 90, or the Mine Act.  Laura Reynolds, \nthe team lead for the CWHSP, testified that she was unaware of any plan to transition the services \nof the CWHSP. \nDebbie Reynolds, a benefits coordinator who directs a black lung program at Bluestone \nHealth Center in Princeton, West Virginia, testified that her program received a letter in early April \nstating that NIOSH had closed the Part 90 program to applications.  An undated memo included \nwith Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2, addressed to “Approved NIOSH CWHSP facilities,” states that “the \nCWHSP is paused.  We cannot accept new chest radiographs, spirometry, or forms at this time.  \nWe will be suspending SAMS and Powershare accounts next week to ensure that NIOSH does not \nreceive radiographs or spirometry tests that we may be unable to process…We have no further \ninformation about the future of the CWHSP at this time.”  (Document 33-3 at 7.)  Ms. Reynolds \ntestified that she knew of multiple miners who had submitted tests from her clinic to NIOSH, \nhoping to exercise their Part 90 job transfer option, but had not received any response when the \nprogram shut down.  She had other miners with x-rays ready to submit.  Those miners, like the \nminers who testified, will continue working in dusty conditions, despite having reason to believe \nthey may have black lung, because the CWHSP is unavailable.   \nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n  Congress determined that “there is an urgent need to provide more effective means and \nmeasures for improving the working conditions and practices in the Nation’s coal or other mines \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 10 of 31 PageID #: 908\nin order to prevent death and serious physical harm, and in order to prevent occupational diseases \noriginating in such mines.”  30 U.S.C. §801(c).  It passed the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act \nof 1969, followed by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) to mandate \nprotections for miners.  30 U.S.C. § 841 provides that “it is the purpose of this subchapter to \nprovide, to the greatest extent possible, that the working conditions in each underground coal mine \nare sufficiently free of respirable dust concentrations in the mine atmosphere to permit each miner \nthe opportunity to work underground during the period of his entire adult working life without \nincurring any disability from pneumoconiosis or any other occupation-related disease during or at \nthe end of such period.”  30 U.S.C. § 841(b).   \n  In general, mine regulations are promulgated and enforced through the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration of the Department of Labor.  However, as part of the program to effectuate \nthe purposes described in the Mine Act, Congress requires HHS to work with mine operators to \nmake  available  “to  each  miner  working  in  a  coal  mine  the  opportunity  to  have  a  chest \nroentgenogram” at intervals not to exceed five years.  30 U.S.C. § 843(a).  HHS is further \nrequired to prescribe uniform specifications for giving, reading, and classifying the tests, and to \ndetermine any need to supplement screening with additional tests.  Id.  The Mine Act requires \nthat such examinations must be provided to miners at no cost to the miner.  30 U.S.C. § 843(c).  \nWhen the examinations show evidence of pneumoconiosis, the miner “shall be afforded the option \nof  transferring  from  his  position  to  another  position  in  any  area  of  the  mine…where  the \nconcentration of respirable dust” is below prescribed levels, without any reduction in pay.  30 \nU.S.C. § 843(b)(2)-(3).  The Mine Act also requires HHS to pay the costs of autopsies performed \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 11 of 31 PageID #: 909\non active miners who die in coal mines and on active and inactive miners who die elsewhere, with \nthe consent of their next of kin.  30 U.S.C. § 843.   \n  NIOSH was established by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.  29 U.S.C. \n§671.  NIOSH is required to permanently establish “an Office of Mine Safety and Health” for the \npurpose of “enhanc[ing] the development of new mine safety technology and technological \napplications and to expedite the commercial availability and implementation of such technology \nin mining environments.”  29 U.S.C. § 671(h)(1)-(2).  “[T]he Office of Mine Safety and Health \nshall be responsible for research, development, and testing of new technologies and equipment \ndesigned to enhance mine safety and health.”  29 U.S.C. §671(h)(3).  The Mine Act incorporates \nreference to NIOSH, including providing for NIOSH and HHS to submit the results of “research, \ndemonstrations, and experiments,” advising the Secretary of Labor of the need for promulgation \nof new rules to effectuate the objectives of the Mine Act.  30 U.S.C. §811(a)(1).   \n  NIOSH is required to approve mine plans, submitted by operators to provide examinations \nof miners for black lung during a 6-month period, beginning no sooner than 3.5 years and ending \nno later than 4.5 years after the ending date of the previous examination period.  42 C.F.R. 37.3(a).  \nMandatory testing must be provided to new miners within 30 days after commencement of \nemployment, three years after the initial examination, and two years thereafter if the second set \nshowed evidence of pneumoconiosis.  42 C.F.R. § 37.3(b).  Spirometry testing must be made \navailable on a similar timeline.  42 C.F.R. § 37.92.  The medical facilities for such exams must \nbe approved by NIOSH, in accordance with standards established by NIOSH.  42 C.F.R. §§ 37.1, \n37.40.    NIOSH is responsible for giving the exam by which physicians may be certified as B \nReaders with “[p]proficiency in evaluating chest radiographs for radiographic quality and in the \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 12 of 31 PageID #: 910\nuse of the ILO Classification for interpreting chest radiographs for pneumoconiosis.”  42 C.F.R. \n§37.52.   \n  30 C.F.R. Part 90 “establishes the option of miners who are employed at coal mines and \nwho have evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis to work in an area of the mine” with \ndust below specified levels.  30 C.F.R. § 90.1; see also 42 C.F.R. § 37.102.  NIOSH makes its \ndetermination that a miner has evidence of the development of pneumoconiosis based on chest \nradiographs and any other medical examinations provided to NIOSH for review.  42 C.F.R. § \n37.102.  “NIOSH will provide radiographic classification, evaluation of spirometry test results, \nand reporting of the results of examinations made at the miner's expense in the same manner as if \nthey were submitted under an operator's plan.”  42 C.F.R. § 37.103.  Miners eligible for the Part \n90 job transfer option provide the Part 90 determination from NIOSH to MSHA, and MSHA is \nresponsible for enforcing the transfer right and enforcing regulations that require the operator to \nmaintain the concentration of respirable dust to which Part 90 miners are exposed below the \napplicable specified levels.  30 C.F.R. §§ 90.100-90.102.   \n  Congress  appropriated  $362,800,000  to  NIOSH  for  carrying  out  its  responsibilities \npursuant to the Mine Act, the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act, \nand other statutes.  Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, PL 118-47, 138 Stat 460, 654 \n(March 23, 2024) (maintained through continuing appropriations).  The 2024 fiscal year budget \nspecifically for the CWHSP was $466,000, according to the testimony of Ms. Wolfe.

Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n(2009). \nSTANDING \nThe Supreme Court has established three elements necessary for constitutional standing: \n(1) “the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact — an invasion of a legally protected interest \nwhich  is  (a)  concrete  and  particularized,  and  (b)  actual  or  imminent,  not  conjectural  or \nhypothetical;”  (2)  “there  must  be  a  causal  connection  between  the  injury  and  the  conduct \ncomplained of;” and (3) “it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will \nbe redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan v.

Plaintiffs must support each \nelement “with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the \nlitigation.”  Id. at 561.  Where the plaintiff is “an object of the action (or foregone action) at \nissue…there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury, and that \na judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.”  Id. at 561–62.  Plaintiffs seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief “must establish an ongoing or future injury in fact.”  Nat'l Ass'n \nof Diversity Officers in Higher Educ. v.

The “zone of interests” test for \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 15 of 31 PageID #: 913\nprudential standing asks “whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is \narguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional \nguarantee in question.”  Ass'n of Data Processing Serv. Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. \n150, 153 (1970).  “[T]he Administrative Procedure Act grants standing to a person ‘aggrieved by \nagency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.’”  Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702 (1964 ed., \nSupp.  IV).    The  Supreme  Court  has  adopted  a  “lenient  approach”  in  the  context  of  the \nAdministrative Procedures Act (APA) as “an appropriate means of preserving the flexibility of the \nAPA’s omnibus judicial-review provision.”  Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, \nInc., 572 U.S. 118, 130 (2014). \nThe Defendants argue that the Plaintiff lacks standing because he has suffered no injury.  \nThey contend that NIOSH reviewed his November 2024 submission of a 2023 CT scan in \nDecember 2024 and sent him a letter indicating the reviewer found no evidence of black lung.  \nThus, the Defendants contend that “nothing remains for HHS to act upon with regard to Plaintiff \nand the CWHSP,” and the Plaintiff is “not eligible for the Part 90 option.”  (Defs.’ Resp. at 8, \nDocument 22.)  Because Mr. Wiley has nothing currently pending with NIOSH, the Defendants \ncontend that he has no concrete injury, and this case should be dismissed for lack of standing.  \nThe Plaintiff notes that the Defendants’ response brief outlines the application regulations \nand how the CWHSP handles medical submissions and makes clear that miners may submit \nadditional medical examinations for review if NIOSH finds no evidence of pneumoconiosis upon \nsubmission.  They note the Defendants’ own statement that “there is no limit to the number of \ntimes a miner can submit other evidence for a Part 90 determination.”  (Defs.’ Resp. at 6-7.)  Mr. \nWiley testified that he did not receive the December 2024 letter indicating that the reviewer found \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 16 of 31 PageID #: 914\nno evidence of black lung in the scan, and now that he is aware of it, he would submit supplemental \nmedical information if the CWHSP were operational.  He argues that the closure of the RHD \nprevents him from accessing free screenings from the CWHSP.  He emphasizes that “the finding \nin December 2024 does not signal the end of Mr. Wiley’s application,” but rather “demonstrates \nhis ongoing injury because he is unable to present dispositive evidence conflicting with the initial \nagency determination.”  (Pl.’s Reply at 5) (Document 25.)  The Plaintiff further contends that he, \nand the class of miners he represents, are the intended beneficiaries of the Mine Act and the Part \n90 regulations, and his claims fall within the zone of interests intended to be protected by the Mine \nAct and related regulations.   \nThe Court finds that Mr. Wiley is likely to establish that he has standing to pursue his \nclaims.  As an active coal miner with diagnosed black lung, he is within the group intended to be \nprotected by the Mine Act and Part 90, and he is among those served by the CWHSP at NIOSH.  \nHe is also among those harmed by its closure.  He credibly testified that, having learned that his \nNovember 2024 medical submission was not sufficient, he would like to submit additional medical \ndocumentation  from  other  providers—documentation  that  presumably  resulted  in  the  West \nVirginia Occupational Pneumoconiosis Board’s finding that he suffers from pneumoconiosis.  He \nalso testified that he would seek additional screening tests from NIOSH if they were being offered.  \nIn short, Mr. Wiley has been diagnosed with black lung, and without the CWHSP, he has no way \nto access the protections of Part 90 to limit the dust exposure that threatens his health and, \nultimately, his life.   \nWhatever led to Mr. Wiley’s failure to receive the December 2024 letter, the Defendants \nare simply incorrect to suggest that that letter closes the matter for Mr. Wiley.  Mr. Wiley has the \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 17 of 31 PageID #: 915\nright to continue submitting medical documentation for review by NIOSH.  The fact that he has \nbeen diagnosed with black lung elsewhere suggests that it is likely that submission of that \ndocumentation and/or participation in additional screening would result in a finding that he has \nevidence of black lung and is eligible for the Part 90 option.  Because the CWHSP is closed and \nits staff placed on leave pending their termination dates, he cannot access those services.  Lacking \na Part 90 letter, he continues to be exposed to coal dust at work.  As the testimony before the \nCourt made clear, that dust exposure will cause his disease to progress until it becomes debilitating.  \nDoes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services genuinely believe that a \nminer diagnosed with black lung is not being injured when the program designed to confirm his \ncondition and provide him with workplace protections to prevent its progression is rendered \ninaccessible?  This Court does not share such a belief.  Mr. Wiley has presented evidence of an \nactual, concrete, particularized, imminent injury, causally connected to the Defendants’ actions in \nindefinitely “pausing” the CWHSP, and that injury would likely be redressed by the relief sought.   \nSOVEREIGN IMMUNITY \nThe Defendants next assert that the Plaintiff’s claims are barred by sovereign immunity.  \nThey contend that sovereign immunity bars Count One, wherein the Plaintiff seeks declaratory \njudgment, because the Declaratory Judgment Act does not waive sovereign immunity or provide \na basis for federal jurisdiction.  They further argue that, although courts have found that sovereign \nimmunity does not shield federal officers sued in their individual capacities from Constitutional \ndue process claims, it does shield the United States and its officials sued in their official capacities, \nand Count Three must therefore be dismissed.  The Defendants concede that the APA contains a \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 18 of 31 PageID #: 916\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, but contend that exceptions to the waiver apply in this case because \nthere is no final, discrete agency action. \nThe Plaintiff relies on the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, which he contends extends \nto permit the related declaratory judgment claim contained in Count One.  He argues that this case \npresents a challenge to final agency action subject to suit under the APA.   \nAs a general matter, “a plaintiff can obtain injunctive relief against an individual officer or \nagent of the United States in his official capacity for acts beyond his statutory or constitutional \nauthority.”  Strickland v. United States, 32 F.4th 311, 363–64 (4th Cir. 2022); see also PFLAG, \nInc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-337-BAH, 2025 WL 685124, at *9-*11 (D. Md. Mar. 4, 2025).  “The \nability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts \nof equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to \nEngland.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015).  As both parties \nrecognize, the APA contains an express waiver of sovereign immunity.  That waiver applies only \nto final agency actions, and “[b]ecause sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature, finality \nunder the APA is a jurisdictional requirement.”  Jake's Fireworks Inc. v. United States Consumer \nProd. Safety Comm'n, 105 F.4th 627, 631 (4th Cir. 2024) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  As discussed below, the Court finds that the Plaintiff’s APA claims are likely to succeed \non the merits.  Therefore, the Defendants’ sovereign immunity defense fails. \nAPA \nThe APA provides that “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy \nin a court [is] subject to judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Courts are directed to: \nhold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions \nfound to be: (a) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 19 of 31 PageID #: 917\notherwise not in accordance with law; (b) contrary to constitutional \nright, power, privilege,  or immunity; (c) in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; (d) \nwithout observance of procedure required by law; (e) unsupported \nby substantial evidence…or (f) unwarranted by the facts to the \nextent that that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing \ncourt.  \n \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A-F).  “An agency action must satisfy two conditions in order to be deemed \n‘final’ under the APA: ‘First, the action must mark the consummation of the agency's decision \nmaking process — it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the \naction must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal \nconsequences  will  flow.’”    Jake's  Fireworks  Inc.  v.  United  States  Consumer  Prod.  Safety \nComm'n, 105 F.4th 627, 631 (4th Cir. 2024) (citing U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs v. Hawkes Co., 578 \nU.S. 590, 597 (2016)).  The “mere possibility that an agency might reconsider its action does not \nsuffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.”  Sierra Club v. W. Virginia Dep't of \nEnv't Prot., 64 F.4th 487, 499–500 (4th Cir. 2023) (quoting Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, 127 \n(2012)).   \n “[F]inal agency action does not encompass an agency’s day-to-day management.”  Clear \nSky Car Wash LLC v. City of Chesapeake, Va., 743 F.3d 438, 445 (4th Cir. 2014) (internal \npunctuation and quotation marks omitted).  “Except where Congress explicitly provides for our \ncorrection of the administrative process at a higher level of generality, we intervene in the \nadministration of the laws only when, and to the extent that, a specific final agency action has an \nactual or immediately threatened effect.”  Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 894 (1990) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).   \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 20 of 31 PageID #: 918\n  In addition to arguments, addressed below, that the Plaintiff’s claims are, at their essence, \nchallenges to employment decisions that must be raised by the employees in other forums rather \nthan under the APA, the Defendants contend that HHS has inherent discretion to reorganize.  \nThey argue that the Plaintiff “speculates that the CWHSP is essentially shuttered, but that is \nnothing more than guesswork,” and the Court cannot properly “second-guess the Secretary’s \njudgment about what staffing levels or office structures” are appropriate.  (Defs. Resp. at 23.)  \nThe Defendants further assert that the Plaintiff’s claim does not challenge a discrete final agency \naction.  Citing news reports and based on the press releases introduced during the preliminary \ninjunction hearing, they argue that “decisions regarding staffing at the Morgantown NIOSH \nfacility are still in flux” and the asserted reorganization is in process.  (Id. at 26.)  They contend \nthat “HHS has never indicated that despite the RIF sent to employees in Morgantown, it does not \nintend to carry out its statutory duties under the Mine Act by, for instance, transferring duties under \nthe CWHSP to other offices.”  (Id. at 27.)   \n  The  Plaintiff  contends  that  by  sending  RIF  notices  and  placing  key  employees  on \nadministrative leave, HHS ceased to fulfill its statutory duties.  He argues that “HHS has offered \nno explanation for how it will continue its mission despite laying off most of the staff at the \nRespiratory Health Division” or how it will replace specialized employees.  (Pl.’s Reply at 10.)  \nHe points to the precedent establishing that the possibility that an agency could reverse the \nchallenged action does not defeat finality.  He contends that the Defendants’ actions are arbitrary \nand capricious because no consideration was given to the programs at issue.  He also contends \nthat the effective elimination of the RHD is contrary to law because it prevents compliance with \nthe Mine Act and because it constitutes an illegal impoundment of funds appropriated by Congress.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 21 of 31 PageID #: 919\n  The Plaintiff presented overwhelming evidence that the CWHSP has ceased operations.  \nEmployees necessary to its operation received RIF notices and are on administrative leave pending \ntheir termination dates.   Approved community facilities received notice that the CWHSP is \npaused and not accepting x-rays or spirometry.  Mr. Wiley’s calls to check the status of his \nsubmission  went  unanswered,  and  another  miner  did  not  receive  the  return  receipt  for  his \nsubmission, sent via certified mail.   \n  Because the CWHSP does such specialized work, the employee terminations carry a great \ndeal of weight in establishing that there has been a final decision to shutter the program.  The \nuncontroverted testimony of multiple highly qualified NIOSH employees indicated that there is no \none else, within HHS or any other agency, that does similar work.  HHS cannot simply add the \nCWHSP  duties  to  epidemiologists  with  other specialties.    Dr.  Laney  testified  that  it  takes \napproximately two years for an epidemiologist to develop, under the mentorship of existing \nexperienced staff, an expertise in occupational pneumoconiosis.  NIOSH developed a program to \ncertify B-Readers.    That, too, is specialized work that cannot  readily be transferred.    The \nemployees testified that there has been no effort to transition their work to others, and they have \nnot been asked to train replacements.  The Defendants offered no contrary testimony or evidence.  \nThe Defendants’ evidence consisted solely of press releases regarding a planned reorganization of \nHHS that contained no mention of the programs at issue.  Thus, the only evidence before the Court \nis that the CWHSP and the RHD have been shut down.  Shutting down programs without \nconducting rulemaking or otherwise engaging in a process that results in an official written \nstatement announcing the shutdown is no less final.  No evidence in the record suggests that the \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 22 of 31 PageID #: 920\nDefendants have any plan to provide the services that have been terminated.2  Therefore, the Court \nfinds that the challenged actions are not merely tentative or interlocutory.  Legal consequences \nfor Mr. Wiley and other miners in his position flow from the closure of the CWHSP: they are \nunable to receive screenings or have medical tests read to obtain the Part 90 transfer option as \nrequired by the Mine Act.  \n  The Court also finds that the Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious and contrary \nto  the  law.    The  Mine  Act  and  associated  regulations  require  HHS  to  provide  medical \nexaminations to screen for black lung, to evaluate chest radiographs and spirometry tests, to issue \nPart 90 findings to miners with signs of black lung, to maintain a mobile health unit that travels to \nmines and mining communities, to maintain the B-Reader program, and to provide chest autopsies \nto examine for black lung in deceased miners.  With the termination of employees and the \ncessation of the CWHSP, HHS and NIOSH are no longer fulfilling those obligations.  The \nDefendants’ sole argument on the merits is that the allegation that the CWHSP has been terminated \nis “speculative” because HHS has issued public statements about a potential reorganization.  This \nargument invites the Court to speculate that perhaps HHS will someday reinstitute some version \nof the services offered by the CWHSP.  There is no dispute that those services are not currently \nbeing offered, and there is no testimony or plan offered explaining how they will resume.  The \nonly reasoning for their actions put forth by the Defendants is an effort to streamline efficiencies.  \n(Defs.’ Resp. at 30.)  The Defendants do not indicate how many extra months of dust inhalation, \nin their considered judgment, is acceptable for a miner with black lung while the program Congress \nestablished to eliminate that risk is “paused.”  The Defendants presented no evidence of any \n \n2 If the Defendants indeed intend to provide the services at issue, the preliminary injunction will require little more \nthan they intended to do in any event.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 23 of 31 PageID #: 921\nreasoned basis for their actions.  Mr. Wiley has established a strong likelihood of success on the \nmerits of his APA claim. \nEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS \n  The Defendants contend that the Plaintiff’s claims, at their core, challenge personnel \ndecisions.    They  argue  that  the  Civil  Service  Reform  Act  and  the  Federal  Service  Labor-\nManagement Relations Statute provide the sole means of challenging personnel decisions and \npreclude judicial review in other forums or by other parties.  In their view, “Congress limited \nreview of federal employment actions to actions by affected employees themselves, in a different \nforum.”  (Defs.’ Resp. at 20-21.)  They note recent decisions addressing challenges to other \naspects of the Trump Administration’s large scale terminations of civil servants and elimination \nof federal agencies and programs that have found that certain claims are likely required to proceed \nthrough the processes established by the Civil Service Reform Act.   \n  The Plaintiff argues that his claims are not employment claims.  While rehiring employees \nis  a  necessary  component  of  re-instituting  the  CWHSP,  he  argues  that  he  challenges  the \n“elimination of functionality…not a personnel decision as such.”  (Pl.’s Reply at 8.)  He notes \nthat the Civil Service Reform Act provides no avenue for “a beneficiary of a Congressionally \nmandated program [to] challenge that program’s unilateral elimination by the Executive.”  (Id.)  \nHe  argues  that  “nothing  in  the  CSRA…suggests  that  Congress  intended  to  make  federal \nemployees, working through the procedures by which they can challenge changes to their own \npersonal employment statuses, the only class of people capable of making sure that federal \nagencies follow through on their Congressional mandates.”  (Id. at 11.)  The Plaintiff further \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 24 of 31 PageID #: 922\nargues that the recent cases cited by the Defendants involved actions brought by employees or \ntheir unions, not by program beneficiaries.   \n  The Supreme Court explained that “[u]nder the Civil Service Reform Act…certain federal \nemployees  may  obtain  administrative  and  judicial  review  of  specified  adverse  employment \nactions.”  Elgin v. Dep't of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 5 (2012).  The Court held that the CSRA \n“provides the exclusive avenue to judicial review when a qualifying employee challenges an \nadverse employment action by arguing that a federal statute is unconstitutional.”  Id.  The Fourth \nCircuit has likewise held that “the CSRA constitutes the exclusive remedy for claims arising out \nof federal employment.”  Hall v. Clinton, 235 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir. 2000).  \n  A split panel of the Fourth Circuit recently stayed a preliminary injunction in which the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland enjoined the termination of probationary \nemployees.  Maryland v. United States Dep't of Agric., No. 25-1248, 2025 WL 1073657, at *1 \n(4th Cir. Apr. 9, 2025).  The court characterized the claims, brought by nineteen states and the \nDistrict of Columbia, as allegations “that the Government violated federal law when it terminated \nthousands of probationary federal employees without following the procedures required for a \nreduction in force, including advance notice to the affected States.”  Id.  The court concluded that \nthe federal agency defendants were likely to succeed on their claim that the district court lacked \njurisdiction because the CSRA provides the exclusive remedy for challenges to employment \nactions.    Id.    The  District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California  issued  a  temporary \nrestraining order preventing the Trump Administration from carrying out its agency restructuring \nplans, RIFs, terminations, and cuts to programs and staff on May 9, 2025.  American Federation \nOf Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, 3:25-cv-03698 (N.D. Cal.) (May 9, 2025 TRO) \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 25 of 31 PageID #: 923\n(Document 85).  That opinion contains a thorough review of the cases addressing the proper \nforum for claims related to the mass terminations and closures of agencies and programs, including \nmultiple cases addressing the argument presented herein that any claim even tangentially involving \npersonnel actions cannot be litigated in federal district courts, which the Court finds to be well-\nreasoned and instructive.  Id. at 18-24. \n  As the Court advised the parties at the outset of the hearing, the Court is not persuaded by \nthe Defendants’ argument that employment decisions are central to the claims in this case.  Mr. \nWiley is not an employee, and he cannot present his claims under the CSRA.  His injury does not \narise  from  any  employment  relationship.    He  is  among  the  intended  beneficiaries  of  a \nCongressionally established program that the  Defendants terminated,  and he challenges the \ncancellation of that program.  Unlike Maryland v. United States Dep't of Agriculture, the central \nclaim in this case is about the services offered to the public, not the direct impact of the \nemployment terminations on employees. No. 25-1248, 2025 WL 1073657, at *1 (4th Cir. Apr. 9, \n2025).   \nThe Defendants seek to frame the elimination of the RHD and the CWHSP as “personnel \ndecisions” because, in eliminating those programs, it sent RIF notices to everyone or nearly \neveryone employed within them.  But the employees have not brought suit here, and the Plaintiff’s \nclaims relate only to his inability to access statutorily mandated programs.  The injuries at issue \nare injuries to coal miners dependent on the CWHSP, not injuries arising from the employment \nterminations, in contrast to the recent cases cited by the Defendants involving other challenges to \nthe Trump Administration’s terminations of large numbers of civil servants with little process.  It \nis patently absurd to suggest that an illegal agency action that includes termination of employees \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 26 of 31 PageID #: 924\nis unreviewable.  That federal law provides a different procedural avenue for relief for employees \naggrieved by the unlawful closure of these programs is irrelevant to the relief available to other \nstakeholders.  Firing people does not insulate arbitrary and capricious agency action from review.  \nThe Court finds that the Plaintiff is likely to succeed in establishing that this Court has jurisdiction \nover his APA and due process claims.   \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FACTORS \n  As explained above, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has made a clear showing that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits of his claims.  The Court previously addressed the harm Mr. Wiley \nwill suffer in the absence of relief to some extent in addressing his injury for standing purposes.  \nHe is unable to access additional testing or to submit outside tests for review by NIOSH, and he is \nunable to seek the right to transfer to a low-dust job.  Absent preliminary relief, he will be exposed \nto coal dust for 40+ hours every week during his employment as a mine electrician.  The damage \nto his lungs cannot be reversed.  The Defendants’ actions force Mr. Wiley, and miners like him, \ninto choosing between their health and livelihood, despite Congress’s efforts to spare them that \nchoice by establishing the job transfer program.  In enacting the relevant provisions of the Mine \nAct, Congress recognized that ongoing exposure to dust in miners with black lung causes the \ndisease to progress.  Dr. Laney and Dr. Hall testified that they are seeing more miners with black \nlung, and more cases that progress quickly.  They also testified that their work, and the work of \nthe CWHSP as a whole, saves lives.  The necessary inverse of that testimony is that cancelling \nthe CWHSP will cost lives.  Remaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley \ncan walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death.  It is difficult to imagine a \nclearer case of irreparable harm.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 27 of 31 PageID #: 925\nImportantly, while this case centers on the impact closure of the CWHSP has on the \nPlaintiff and other miners, the testimony at the preliminary injunction hearing highlighted the work \nof  NIOSH  employees.    The  employees  and  former  employee  who  testified  were  deeply \nknowledgeable and evinced a deep commitment to the miners they serve.  Ms. Wolfe, who retired \nin 2020 but continued to work as a consultant for NIOSH until recently and has served as \nsomething of a self-appointed spokesperson for the CWHSP and the RHD since the shut-down of \nthose programs, testified that she viewed her decades-long career as a tribute to honor her late \nfather, a miner who died of black lung.  Dr. Laney became emotional when he explained that he \nwould soon have to find other work, and, given his specialization and likely role in another lab, he \nwould be unlikely to be in a position to return to government service if, a few months from now, \nthe RHD returned to operation.  Each of the NIOSH employees testified that their work saves \nminers’ lives, and they were visibly distraught when explaining that miners’ diseases would \nprogress unchecked without these programs.  The federal government, the Defendants, and most \nimportantly, the miners served by the CWHSP, within the RHD at NIOSH, are fortunate to have \nthe professional skills of these highly qualified public servants.  Losing the services of these \nexperienced and dedicated employees is an aspect of the irreparable harm to the miners and the \npublic that cannot and should not be ignored. \nThis case involves governmental Defendants, and so the balance of equities and the public \ninterest tests merge.  The Court finds a strong public interest in maintaining miners’ access to the \nCWHSP and Part 90.  Other miners are impacted by the same harms as Mr. Wiley.  Thousands \nof miners will go without screening for black lung, and those with black lung will be deprived of \naccess to the Part 90 transfer option.  Halting research that helps ensure effective, targeted, and \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 28 of 31 PageID #: 926\nefficient preventative measures harms the public both by increasing the prevalence of black lung \nand by increasing the costs of preventative measures and of treatment and benefits.   \nThe Defendants argue that “the public has a strong interest in permitting the President to \ntake decisive action when it comes to setting his policy priorities for HHS.”  (Defs.’ Resp. at 30.)  \nThey also express concern that an injunction in this case “would invite similar emergency litigation \nany time an agency undertakes a restructuring or similar programmatic change with virtually any \npotential downstream effects on public services.”    (Id. at 31.)3   However, concerns  about \nseparation of powers and proper use of federal funds cut against the Defendants in this case.  \nCongress passed the Mine Act, established NIOSH, and appropriated funds for the duties fulfilled \nby the CWHSP, and the Defendants lack the authority to unilaterally cancel the CWHSP.  There \nis “no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  Rhode Island v. Trump, No. \n1:25-CV-128-JJM-LDA, 2025 WL 1303868, at *17 (D.R.I. May 6, 2025) (quoting League of \nWomen Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016)) (granting a preliminary injunction to \nprohibit attempts to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business \nDevelopment Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service).  As the District Court \nfor the Northern District of California recently found, “the President may broadly restructure \nfederal agencies only when authorized by Congress.”  American Federation of Government \nEmployees, AFL-CIO v. Trump, 3:25-cv-03698, (N.D. Cal.) (May 9, 2025 TRO) (Document 85 at \n28) (further explaining, at 39, that the temporary restraining order “does not prevent the President \n \n3 The ship has sailed regarding proliferation of emergency litigation in cases of this nature.  See, e.g., Litigation \nTracker:  Legal  Challenges  to  Trump  Administration  Actions,  Just  Security, \nhttps://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/ (visited May 12, 2025 \nat 11:37 a.m.).  Another option for reducing emergency litigation would be compliance with the Administrative \nProcedure Act and other laws and legal principles that constrain executive branch authority.    \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 29 of 31 PageID #: 927\nfrom exercising his Article  II powers, it prevents him from exercising Congress’ Article  I \npowers”).4  To the extent this Order constrains any lawful authority of the Defendants, the Court \nfinds that the balance of equities and the public interest tip decidedly in favor of the Plaintiff.   \nSCOPE OF RELIEF \n  The Defendants argue that the orders requested by the Plaintiff are not narrowly tailored to \nremedy the alleged harm.  Uncontroverted evidence before the Court overwhelmingly establishes \nthat the mandatory statutory duties cannot effectively be fulfilled without an injunction terminating \nthe RIFs.  Testing for, diagnosing, preventing, and researching black lung is a highly specialized \nfield—it simply is not possible to transfer the duties of the RHD employees to others without a \nperiod of transition and training.  The Plaintiffs presented credible testimony that the functions of \nthe CWHSP require the work of all employees within the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division.  \nThe  Defendants  presented  no  evidence  to  contradict  the  witness  testimony  indicating  that \nCWHSP’s work is not duplicated elsewhere in government.  Nor did the Defendants present \nevidence that employees with the qualifications necessary to operate the mobile screening unit, \ncertify B-Readers, or interpret chest x-rays or spirographs for evidence of black lung exist \nelsewhere in HHS.  The Defendants also presented no evidence that individual employees or \ngroups of employees could be terminated without impacting NIOSH’s ability to perform the \nmandatory duties set forth in the Mine Act and associated regulations.  They offered no specific \n \n4 This case exemplifies the importance of Congress’s role in allocating federal funds and establishing federal \nprograms.  Mining is concentrated in certain regions in the United States, and congressional representatives from \nthose regions are likely to be more familiar with the needs of their constituents who work in the mining industry and \nwith the health and occupational safety issues specific to their regions.  When Congress acts on a budget or bill \nimpacting miners, representatives and senators who represent miners can advocate for their interests.  The executive \nbranch has no similar geographic representation.  Apart from maintaining separation of powers and avoiding \nconcentration of power in a single branch, permitting the executive alone to determine which health programs to \nprioritize deprives the people of representation.    \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-00227     Document 36     Filed 05/13/25     Page 30 of 31 PageID #: 928\nnarrower form of relief that would effectuate the purposes of the proposed injunction.  Therefore, \nthe Court finds that an injunction requiring full restoration of the NIOSH Respiratory Health \nDivision,  rescission  of  the  RIFs,  and  compelling  continued  health  surveillance  through  the \nCWHSP and the job transfer program under 30 U.S.C. § 843 is necessary and appropriate.   \nCONCLUSION \n  Wherefore, after thorough review and careful consideration, the Court ORDERS that the \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document 7) be GRANTED.   \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n  The Court ORDERS that the RIFs in the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division be enjoined \nand, therefore, rescinded to facilitate the full restoration of the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division \nincluding health surveillance through the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program and the job \ntransfer program.  Further, in the event of reorganization, the Court ORDERS that there be no \npause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress in the Mine Act and \nthe attendant regulations for the health and safety of miners.  Lastly, the Court ORDERS that the \nDefendant Secretary submit written certification to this Court within twenty (20) days of the entry \nof this Order that compliance with the same is complete. \n  In light of the Court’s findings regarding the absence of any meaningful harm to the \nDefendants related to this injunction preserving the status quo, as well as the high likelihood that \nthe Plaintiff will prevail on the merits, the Court ORDERS that the security required by Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 65(c) be set at ZERO.
