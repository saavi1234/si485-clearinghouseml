    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the Trump administration&rsquo;s use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport noncitizens without due process. You can see all of the cases <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&amp;special_collection=38953&amp;ordering=-summary_approved_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. This case was also certified related to <a href=\"../../../../case/46501/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sanchez Puentes, et al., v. Garite, et al.</a>. &nbsp;Both cases revolved around the use of the AEA to remove noncitizens in Texas and the resolution of the motions pending in either case could impact the other.</p>\r\n<p>This petition arises out of the president's peacetime invocation of the AEA. The petitioner is a 33-year-old Venezuelan national detained at the El Paso Processing Center. After coming to the US, the petitioner was granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) which shields her from detention. On April 9, 2025, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained the petitioner in Ohio, despite her active TPS.</p>\r\n<p>On May 10, 2025, the petitioner filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, a motion to proceed under a pseudonym, and a motion for class certification. The plaintiff named President Donald Trump, the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and other officials, the Department of State and its Secretary, the Department of Defense and its Secretary, and the wardens of several detention centers as Defendants.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff sought to represent a class challenging the federal government's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and remove Venezuelan noncitizens from the United States without due process. She alleged that the government's actions exceeded it authority under the AEA and violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and Due Process under the Fifth Amendment. The case was assigned to Senior District Judge David Briones.</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, 2025, Judge Briones issued a class-wide temporary restraining order&mdash;prohibiting removal of potential class members and requiring certain advance notice to attorneys&mdash;while also setting an expedited briefing schedule on class certification. 2025 WL 1379220.</p>\r\n<p>On May 16, the court issued two orders: (1) an order for the Respondents to show cause at to why the Petitioner's writ should not be granted; (2) an \"Order Extending the Original Temporary Restraining Order\" until June 10, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>The petitioner moved for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025 to enjoin the respondents from removing the petitioner or members of the certified class from the United States under the AEA. The motion alleged that the petitioners, and the class members, could be removed with no process if preliminary relief were not granted. This could result torture or a life sentence in El Salvador-- a harm the government refused to remedy in the past.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, the court ordered that the hearing for the preliminary injunction be combined with a trial on the merits. The court also certified a class of \"all noncitizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" 2025 WL 1479504. The court found that even though there may be questions of fact amongst the class members that may require individualized hearings to resolve, they shared the common claim that the Proclamation is unlawful.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the petitioner's class-wide writ of habeas corpus and motion for a preliminary injunction on June 9, 2025. 2025 WL 1622260. While habeas petitions are typically granted individually, the court found that because their claims for relief imply the illegality of their removal under the AEA, their claims fall within the 'core' of the writ of habeas corpus and could be brought through this suit.</p>\r\n<p>Finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the court treated the petitioner's motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment, and thus, issued permanent injunctive relief. Proclamation 10903 was declared unlawful and the respondents were enjoined from removing the members of the certified class from the United States pursuant to Proclamation 10903.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Petitioner-Plaintiff M.A.P.S. (“Petitioner”) is a Venezuelan national in \nimmigration custody at risk of imminent removal under the President’s Proclamation invoking \nthe Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”).  \n2.  By its terms, the AEA applies only where the United States is in a “declared war” \nwith a “foreign nation or government,” or a “foreign nation or government” has engaged in, or is \nthreatening to engage in, an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” against the “territory of the \nUnited States.” 50 U.S.C. § 21. \n3.  The Proclamation at issue here invoking the AEA is entitled: “Invocation of the \nAlien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua.1 It authorizes \nthe “immediate” removal, without notice or judicial review, of noncitizens over the age of \nfourteen who the government claims are members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de \nAragua (“TdA”), excluding lawful permanent residents. It also overrides all the procedural and \nsubstantive protection afforded by Congress for noncitizens in immigration proceedings, \nincluding protection against the removal to a place where they will face torture. \n4.  Although the AEA requires that its invocation be made “public,” the Proclamation \nis dated March 14, 2015, but was not made public until March 15. The government, however, \nattempted to remove individuals under the Proclamation before it was made public. \n5.  The AEA, enacted in 1798, provides the President with wartime authority and has \nbeen used only three times in our Nation’s history: the War of 1812, World War I and World \nWar II. \n6.  It may not be used against a criminal gang or during peacetime. \n \n1 Available at https://perma.cc/ZS8M-ZQHJ. \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 4 of 28\n7.  Nonetheless, on March 15, the government removed at least 137 Venezuelan \nnoncitizens under the Proclamation to one of the world’s most notorious prisons in El Salvador, \nwhere they may remain incommunicado for the rest of their lives according to the Salvadoran \nPresident. \n8.  These individuals were sent to this brutal prison without any court having had an \nopportunity to review the threshold questions of whether a criminal gang can be deemed a \n“foreign government or nation” within the meaning of the AEA, or whether criminal activity and \nmigration can constitute a military “invasion or predatory incursion” of the “territory of the \nUnited States;” under the Act. \n9.  These individuals were also given no opportunity to contest their designation as \nmembers of the TdA gang and therefore did not even fall with the Proclamation. And more and \nmore evidence is emerging that many (perhaps most) of these individuals lacked any ties to the \ngang and were mistakenly placed under the Proclamation. \n10.  That more individuals are not languishing in a Salvadoran prison is the result of a \nnationwide class Temporary Restraining Order issued by Judge Boasberg in the District of \nColumbia. J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, 2025 WL 825115, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, \n2025). The D.C. Circuit declined to stay the TRO, J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5067, 2025 WL \n914682, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025), but the Supreme Court vacated the TRO, Trump v. \nJ.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1006 (Apr. 7, 2025). However, the Supreme Court made clear that \nreview was available by habeas, that individuals subjected to the Proclamation are entitled to \n“due process” and must be given “notice . . . within a reasonable time and in such a manner as \nwill allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.” \nId.  \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 5 of 28\n11.  Sometime in April 2025, Petitioner was served with an English-only document \nalleging that she is a TdA member, and therefore an alien enemy. The notice did not contain any \nsubstantive information about the basis for the allegations, and did not include any information \nabout whether or in what forum she could challenge the designation. As a result, Petitioner \nbrings this habeas action in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling that habeas is the proper \nmechanism to challenge the Proclamation’s application.  \n12.  Petitioner also seeks to represent a class of similarly-situated individuals seeking \nto challenge the Proclamation’s application against them. The government has stated that it may \ngive as little as 12 hours’ notice to those it designates, and that notice does not include any \nspecific information about how they may challenge that designation or a timeline for such a \nchallenge. During those 12 hours, only those who specifically state an intent to file a habeas \npetition challenging that designation would then get 24 hours to actually file such a petition—all \nnotwithstanding the Supreme Court’s express statement that individuals must be given notice \nadequate to allow them to “actually” seek judicial review. Although a judge in this District has \nsua sponte ordered the government to provide 21 days’ notice, written in a language the \nindividual understands and informing the individual of their right to seek judicial review and \nconsult with an attorney, Sanchez Puentes v. Garite, No. EP-25-CV-00127-DB, 2025 WL \n1203179, at *16 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 25, 2025), the government is seeking to stay that order on the \nground that it was not issued in the context of a class action. Petitioner therefore bring this class \nhabeas petition and complaint to seek class-wide relief within this district. \n13.  The Proclamation is unlawful for three principal reasons: the Proclamation (1) \nfails to satisfy the statutory predicates of the AEA because the TdA is not a “foreign government \nor nation” not is it involved in a military “invasion or predatory incursions” of the “territory of \n5 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 6 of 28\nthe United States;” (2) sweeps away the procedural and substantive protections Congress enacted \nfor the protection of noncitizens subject to removal; and (3) provides no notice or opportunity for \njudicial review to show that an individual is not in fact a member of the TdA and therefore falls \nwholly outside of the Proclamation. \n14.    Across the country, multiple judges have already held, in either a preliminary or \nmerits posture, that there is no authority for the government’s actions. See, e.g., J.A.V. v. Trump, \n--- F. Supp. 3d ----, No. 1:25-CV-072, 2025 WL 1257450, at *18 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025) \n(Rodriguez, J.) (“the Court concludes that the President’s invocation of the AEA through the \nProclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful”); D.B.U. v. Trump, \nNo. 1:25-CV-01163-CNS, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1304288, at *7 (D. Colo. May 6, 2025) \n(Sweeney, J.) (“Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the President’s \ninvocation of the Act ‘through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute’ and is therefore \nunlawful”); G.F.F. v. Trump, No. 25 CIV. 2886 (AKH), --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1301052, \nat *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 6, 2025) (Hellerstein, J.) (“since Respondents have not demonstrated the \nexistence of a “war,” “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” the AEA was not validly invoked by \nthe Presidential Proclamation”); J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5067, 2025 WL 914682, at *8-10 (D.C. \nCir. Mar. 26, 2025) (Henderson, J., concurring) (AEA predicates of “invasion” or “predatory \nincursion” not met); id. at *13 (Millett, J., concurring) (“The Constitution’s demand of due \nprocess cannot be so easily thrown aside.”); D.B.U v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-01163, --- F. Supp. 3d \n----, 2025 WL 1163530, at *12 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025) (“the Court agrees with Petitioners the \nnotice provided is deficient”), stay pending appeal denied, No. 25-1164 (10th Cir. Apr. 29, \n2025); J.G.G. v. Trump, Civ. No. 25-766 (JEB), --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 890401, at *14 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2025) (Boasberg, J.) (“summary deportation . . . without giving him the \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 7 of 28\nopportunity to consider whether to voluntarily self-deport or challenge the basis for the order - is \nunlawful”); see also Sanchez Puentes, 2025 WL 1203179, at *16 (Briones, J.) (issuing sua \nsponte order “because of due process and jurisdiction considerations”). \n15.  Nevertheless, the government has twice attempted (once successfully) to remove \nindividuals under the AEA without any meaningful process. First, on March 15, the government \nsecretly loaded people onto planes, published the Proclamation, and removed at least 137 people \nwithin hours to a brutal prison in El Salvador. Those removed received no notice of their \ndesignation nor any opportunity to contest it. Second, on April 17, the government provided \nindividuals with an English-only notice form that did not inform them of their right to seek \njudicial review. Hours after distributing the notices, the government loaded people onto buses \nand drove them towards the airport, only turning around after counsel filed an emergency appeal \nin the Supreme Court.  \n16.  This Court’s intervention is necessary so that Petitioner and the putative class are \nnot unlawfully sent to a Salvadoran prison pursuant to the Proclamation, perhaps for the \nremainder of their lives; or to Venezuela or other locations where they are likely to face \nindefinite imprisonment, persecution or other harm. \n17.  Petitioner and the class in this action do not here contest any aspect of their \nongoing immigration proceedings. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  This case arises under the Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”), 50 U.S.C. §§ 21-24; the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. and its implementing \nregulations; the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), see Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub.

I, § 9, cl. 2 of the U.S. Constitution (Suspension Clause); 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (United \nStates as defendant); 28 U.S.C. § 1361 (mandamus); and 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (All Writs Act).  \n20.  The Court may grant relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241; 28 U.S.C. § 2243; the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq.; the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651; and \nthe Court’s inherent equitable powers. \n21.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 2241; 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b); and, \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because at the time of filing the Petitioner was detained in the \nRespondents’ custody within the Western District of Texas; a substantial part of the events and \nomissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district; as warden of the El Paso Processing \nCenter, Respondent Garite resides in this district; and Respondents, other than Respondents B. \nThompson, Collins, R.

Petitioner M.A.P.S. is a 33-year-old Venezuelan national who is detained at El \nPaso Processing Center in El Paso, Texas pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act and is at risk of \nimminent removal. M.A.P.S. fled Venezuela after repeated harassment, assault and intimidation \non the basis of political persecution. She entered the United States with a CBP One appointment \nin April 2023, was later granted Temporary Protected Status, and is seeking asylum, withholding \nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture from Venezuela. On April 9, \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 9 of 28\n2025, ICE arrested her in Ohio, despite her active Temporary Protected Status which shields her \nfrom detention. Sometime thereafter, she was asked to sign documents referencing the Alien \nEnemies Act and TdA. M.A.P.S. was told by officers the TdA allegations were because of her \ntattoos but she denies any affiliation or membership with TdA. M.A.P.S. refused to sign the \ndocuments, and she has been detained ever since. She is afraid of being sent to Venezuela, El \nSalvador, or some unknown third country. \nB.

The AEA is a wartime authority enacted in 1798 that grants the President specific \npowers with respect to the regulation, detention, and deportation of “alien enemies.” 50 U.S.C. § \n21. \n42.  The AEA, as codified today, provides that “[w]henever there is a declared war \nbetween the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory \nincursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any \nforeign nation or government, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all \nnatives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of \nfourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized, \nshall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.” 50 U.S.C. \n§ 21. \n43.  The AEA can thus be triggered in only two situations. The first is when a formal \ndeclared war exists with a foreign nation or government. The second is when a foreign nation or \ngovernment perpetrates, attempts, or threatens an invasion or predatory incursion against the \nterritory of the United States. \n44.  To trigger the AEA, the President must make a public proclamation of the \ndeclared war, or of the attempted or threatened invasion or predatory incursion. Id. \n45.  Section 21 of the AEA also provides that noncitizens must be afforded a right of \nvoluntary departure. Only noncitizens who “refuse or neglect to depart” are subject to removal. \nId. § 21. \n12 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 13 of 28\n46.  Section 22 of the AEA specifies the terms of departure for noncitizens designated \nas alien enemies. It grants noncitizens the full time to depart as stipulated by any treaty between \nthe United States and the enemy nation, unless the noncitizen has engaged in “actual hostility” \nagainst the United States. If no such treaty exists, the President may declare a “reasonable time” \nfor departure, “according to the dictates of humanity and national hospitality.” Id. § 22.  \n47.  The Act has been used only three times in American history, all during actual or \nimminent wartime. \n48.  The AEA was first invoked several months into the War of 1812, but President \nMadison did not use the AEA to remove anyone from the United States during the war. \n49.  The AEA was invoked a second time during World War I by President Wilson. \nUpon information and belief, there were no removals effectuated pursuant to the AEA during \nWorld War I. \n50.  The AEA was used again during World War II, though it was never used as a \nwidespread method of removal. \n51.  On December 7, 1941, after the Japanese invaded Hawaii in the attack on Pearl \nHarbor, President Roosevelt proclaimed that Japan had perpetrated an invasion upon the territory \nof the United States. The president issued regulations applicable to Japanese nationals living in \nthe United States. The next day Congress declared war on Japan. \n52.  On the same day, President Roosevelt issued two separate proclamations stating \nthat an invasion or predatory incursion was threatened upon the territory of the United States by \nGermany and Italy. The president incorporated the same regulations that were already in effect \nas to Japanese people for German and Italian people. Three days later Congress voted \nunanimously to declare war against Germany and Italy. \n13 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 14 of 28\n53.  Congress declared war against Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria on June 5, 1942. \nJust over a month later, President Roosevelt issued a proclamation recognizing that declaration \nof war and invoking the AEA against citizens of those countries. \n54.  Under these proclamations, the United States infamously interned noncitizens \nfrom Japan, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria (with U.S. citizens of Japanese \ndescent subject to a separate order that did not rely on the AEA). \n55.  It was not until the end of hostilities that the President provided for the removal of \nalien enemies from the United States under the AEA.  On July 14, 1945, President Truman \nissued a proclamation providing that alien enemies detained as a danger to public peace and \nsafety “shall be subject upon the order of the Attorney General to removal from the United \nStates.” The Department of Justice subsequently issued regulations laying out the removal \nprocess. See 10 Fed. Reg. 12,189 (Sept. 28, 1945). The regulations required, inter alia, notice of \nthe removal order to be served on the designated alien enemy and that the alien enemy had thirty \n(30) days thereafter to depart—during which time they could seek judicial review of the removal \norder. Id. \nSystemic Overhaul of Immigration Law in 1952 \n56.  Following the end of World War II, Congress consolidated U.S. immigration laws \ninto a single text under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (“INA”). \n57.  The INA, and its subsequent amendments, provide for a comprehensive system of \nprocedures that the government must follow before removing a noncitizen from the United \nStates. The INA now provides the exclusive procedure by which the government may determine \nwhether to remove an individual. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3). \n14 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 15 of 28\n58.  In addition to laying out the process by which the government determines whether \nto remove an individual, the INA also enshrines certain forms of humanitarian protection. \n59.  First, the INA provides that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United \nStates or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival . . . ), \nirrespective of such alien’s status,” may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). To qualify for \nasylum, a noncitizen must show a “well-founded fear of persecution” on account of a protected \nground, such as race, nationality, political opinion, or religion. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). \n60.  Second, save for certain limited exceptions, Congress has barred the removal of \nan individual to a country where it is more likely than not that he would face persecution on one \nof these protected grounds. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). That protection implements this country’s \nobligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of \nRefugees. The relevant form of relief, known as “withholding of removal,” requires the applicant \nto satisfy a higher standard with respect to the likelihood of harm than asylum, but this form of \nrelief is mandatory if the standard is met. \n61.  Third, the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) prohibits the government from \nreturning a noncitizen to a country where it is more likely than not that he would face torture. See \n8 U.S.C. § 1231 note. That protection implements the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \nAct of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title XXII, § 2242. As with withholding \nof removal, CAT relief also requires the applicant to satisfy a higher standard with respect to the \nlikelihood of harm than asylum and relief is mandatory if that standard is met. There is no \nexception to CAT relief. \n15 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 16 of 28\nPresident Trump’s Proclamation Invoking the AEA \n62.  On March 14, the President signed the AEA Proclamation at issue here. It \nprovides that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA [Tren \nde Aragua], are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent \nresidents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as \nAlien Enemies.” See Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United \nStates by Tren de Aragua (Mar. 15, 2025).2 \n63.  Although the AEA calls for a “public proclamation,” 50 U.S.C. § 21, the \nadministration did not make the invocation public until around 3:53 p.m. EDT on March 15, \ndespite making extensive preparations and attempts to remove class members under the Act. \n64.  The Proclamation claims that the TdA gang is engaged in an invasion and \npredatory incursion into the United States, and that the gang should be considered a “foreign \ngovernment.” \n65.  The Proclamation thus states that all Venezuelan citizens ages fourteen or older \nalleged to be members of TdA who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are alien \nenemies. \n66.  The Proclamation provides no means or process for individuals to contest that \nthey are members of the TdA and do not therefore fall within the terms of the Proclamation. Nor \ndoes it provide individuals with the statutory grace period required under Section 22, during \nwhich they can both seek judicial review or arrange their affairs and leave voluntarily. The \nProclamation instead invokes the statutory exception to the “reasonable notice” requirement by \n \n2 Available at: https://perma.cc/ZS8M-ZQHJ. \n16 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 17 of 28\nclaiming that the individuals subject to the Proclamation are “chargeable with actual hostility,” \nand pose “a public safety risk.” \n67.  Since March 15, Respondent DOD has operated at least one flight transporting \nindividuals from the United States to CECOT in El Salvador. Several of those individuals were \nalleged to be affiliated with TdA. \n68.  The government employs a standardized check list, the “Alien Enemy Validation \nGuide,” to determine who is an “alien enemy” subject to the Proclamation. An ICE officer \ncompletes the form, tallying points for different categories of alleged TdA membership \ncharacteristics. \n69.  The checklist’s methodology relies on several dubious criteria, including physical \nattributes like tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti, and manner of dress. Experts who \nstudy the TdA have explained how none of these physical attributes are reliable ways of \nidentifying members of the TdA. \n70.  On April 23, 2025, Respondents submitted a declaration in the Southern District \nof Texas, under seal, with information about the notice process that the government had for \nindividuals designated for removal under the AEA. See Sealed Cisneros Decl., J.A.V. v. Trump, \nNo. 1:25-cv-072 (S.D. Tex. filed Apr. 23, 2025), ECF No. 45, Exhibit D. That declaration and its \naccompanying exhibit were unsealed the next day. Oral Order, J.A.V. v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-072 \n(S.D. Tex. Apr. 24, 2025). The declaration states that individuals are given 12 hours’ notice \nahead of scheduled removal and that if they express an intent to file a habeas petition, they are \ngiven 24 hours to actually file that petition. Cisneros Decl. ¶ 11, J.A.V. v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-\n072 (S.D. Tex. filed Apr. 24, 2025), ECF No. 49. The notice process is patently inadequate as a \nmatter of due process. \n17 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 18 of 28\n71.  Multiple judges have already found that the Proclamation is likely unlawful. \n72.  First, the Proclamation does not satisfy the statutory requirements for proper \ninvocation of the Alien Enemies Act. Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or \nforeign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government. See D.B.U., 2025 WL \n1304288, at *7 (Sweeney, J.). The United States is not in a declared war with Venezuela. The \nUnited States cannot declare war against Tren de Aragua because it is not a nation. And neither \nVenezuela nor Tren de Aragua have invaded or threated to invade the United States, nor has \neither engaged in a “predatory incursion” of the “territory of the United States” within the \nmeaning of the Act. See J.A.V., 2025 WL 1257450, at *18 (Rodriguez, J.); G.F.F., 2025 WL \n1301052, *10 (Hellerstein, J.); D.B.U., 2025 WL 1304288, at *6 (Sweeney, J.); J.G.G., 2025 WL \n914682, at *5–10 (Henderson, J., concurring). \n73.  The Proclamation also violates the process and protections that Congress has \nprescribed elsewhere in the country’s immigration laws for the removal of noncitizens. \nNoncitizens subject to the Proclamation are not afforded the procedural or substantive protection \nunder the INA, including under Convention Against Torture. \n74.  Moreover, there is no meaningful notice or opportunity for individuals to \nchallenge their designation as alien enemies. There is thus a significant risk that even individuals \nwho do not fall under the terms of the Proclamation will be subject to it. See G.F.F., 2025 WL \n1301052, *8 (Hellerstein, J.); D.B.U., 2025 WL 1304288, at *8 (Sweeney, J.); J.G.G., 2025 WL \n914682, at *14 (Millett, J., concurring); J.G.G., 2025 WL 890401, at *2 (Boasberg, J.). \n75.  As a result of the Proclamation, countless Venezuelans—including Petitioner and \nthe putative class in this District—are at imminent risk of removal pursuant to the Proclamation \n18 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 19 of 28\nwithout any hearing or meaningful review, regardless of the absence of any ties to TdA or the \navailability of claims for relief from and defenses to removal.  \n76.  A judge in this District, though reserving a ruling on the lawfulness of the \ninvocation, has held that individuals designated alien enemies have a right to an evidentiary \nhearing in federal district court, brought through a habeas petition, to challenge their designation. \nSanchez Puentes, 2025 WL 1203179, at *8-9. At such a hearing, the government is owed no \ndeference and must prove TdA membership by “clear, unequivocal, and convincing” evidence. \nId. at *9. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n77.  Petitioner brings this action under both Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) \nand 23(b)(2) and principles of habeas and equity on behalf of himself and a class of all other \npersons similarly situated. \n78.  Petitioner seeks to represent the following Proposed Class: All noncitizens in \ncustody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 \nPresidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion \nof the United States by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its implementation. \n79.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because the class is \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Hundreds of Venezuelans living in \nTexas and the greater southern U.S. region will potentially be subjected to summary removal \nunder the Proclamation and its implementation by Respondents. Several weeks ago, the \ngovernment identified nationwide 86 people in detention subject to the Proclamation and 172 \nmore who are at liberty. See supra, Cerna Decl. ¶ 6. Based on the former number alone, \nPetitioner clears the bar, but there are likely to be more individuals entering the class as more of \n19 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 20 of 28\nthe 172 individuals are taken into ICE custody. Upon information and belief, the government has \nin the past weeks transferred Venezuelan people, including Named Petitioner, from detention \ncenters all over the country to Texas, despite their pending removal proceedings in immigration \ncourt. Dozens of Venezuelans were nearly removed out of northern Texas in mid-April, but for \nthe Supreme Court’s last-minute stay on their removal. Dozens of Venezuelans currently remain \nin custody in the Western District of Texas. As such, many individuals in this District are at \nimminent risk of summary removal pursuant to the Proclamation. The proposed class also \nincludes numerous future noncitizens who will be subjected to the Proclamation, as the \ngovernment has repeatedly stated that it intends to continue using the Proclamation absent court \nintervention. Because ICE continues to “track[] the TdA members who are amenable to removal \nproceedings,” see supra, Cerna Decl. ¶ 6, and more individuals will be designated under the \nProclamation, “the class includes unknown, unnamed future members.” Pederson v. La. State \nUniv., 213 F.3d 858, 868 n.11 (5th Cir. 2000); see also Jack v. Am. Linen Supply Co., 498 F.2d \n122, 124 (5th Cir. 1974) (discussing impracticability of joinder of unknown persons); Phillips v. \nJoint Legislative Comm., 637 F.2d 1014, 1022 (5th Cir. 1981) (“joinder of unknown individuals \nis certainly impracticable”). The government has also stated in ongoing briefing in Sanchez \nPuentes v. Garite, that a district-wide order covering those who “will be” subject to the AEA \n“likely includes every detained noncitizen in the Western District of Texas.” Mot. to Stay \nPending Appeal at 3, Sanchez Puentes v. Garite, No.  3:25-cv-00127-DB (W.D. Tex. filed May \n3, 2025), ECF No. 36, thus essentially conceding numerosity. \n80.  The class satisfies the commonality requirements of Rule 23(a)(2). The members \nof the class are subject to a common practice: summary removal under the Proclamation contrary \nto the AEA, the INA, and due process. The suit also raises threshold questions of law common to \n20 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 21 of 28\nmembers of the proposed class, including whether the Proclamation and its implementation \nsatisfy the statutory requirements of the AEA; whether the Proclamation may lawfully override \nthe protections afforded noncitizens under the INA; and whether the lack of due process violates \nthe Fifth Amendment. \n81.  The proposed class satisfies the typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(3), because \nthe claims of the representative Petitioner are typical of the claims of the class. Each proposed \nclass member, including the proposed class representatives, has experienced or faces the same \nprincipal injury (unlawful removal), based on the same government practice (the Proclamation \nand its implementation), which is unlawful as to the entire class because it violates the AEA, the \nINA, and due process. \n82.  The proposed class satisfies the adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(4). The \nrepresentative Petitioner seeks the same relief as the other members of the class—among other \nthings, an order declaring the Proclamation unlawful and an injunction preventing enforcement \nof the Proclamation. In defending their rights, Petitioner will defend the rights of all proposed \nclass members fairly and adequately. \n83.  The proposed class is represented by experienced attorneys from the American \nCivil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. Proposed Class Counsel \nhave extensive experience litigating class action lawsuits and other complex systemic cases in \nfederal court on behalf of noncitizens. \n84.  The proposed class also satisfies Rule 23(b)(2). Respondents have acted (or will \nact) on grounds generally applicable to the class by subjecting them to summary removal under \nthe Proclamation rather than affording them the protection of immigration laws. Injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief is therefore appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n21 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 22 of 28\n85.  The proposed class also satisfies the requirements for a class guided by Rule 23 \nbut certified under equity habeas principles. \nCAUSES OF ACTION3 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq. \n(All Respondents) \n \n86.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n87.  The AEA does not authorize the removal of noncitizens from the United States \nabsent a “declared war” or a “perpetrated, attempted, or threatened” “invasion or predatory \nincursion” against the “territory of the United States” into the United States by a “foreign nation \nor government.” See 50 U.S.C. § 21. \n88.  The Proclamation and its implementation do not satisfy these statutory \npreconditions. \n89.  Additionally, the AEA permits removal only where noncitizens alleged to be \n“alien enemies” “refuse or neglect to depart” from the United States. 50 U.S.C. § 21. The AEA \nalso requires the government to afford noncitizens alleged to be “alien enemies” sufficient time \nto settle their affairs and to depart the United States. See 50 U.S.C. § 22. \n90.  However, Petitioner and the class are at imminent risk of forced removal without \nbeing afforded the privilege of voluntary departure, let alone any notice or an opportunity to \nrespond to the designation of alien enemy. \n \n3 Insofar as a cause of action seeks to enjoin Respondents, Petitioner does not seek such relief \nagainst the President. \n22 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 23 of 28\n91.  The application of the AEA Process to Petitioner and the class is therefore ultra \nvires. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. \n(All Respondents) \n \n92.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n93.  The INA provides that a removal proceeding before an immigration judge under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1229a is “the sole and exclusive procedure” by which the government may determine \nwhether to remove an individual, “[u]nless otherwise specified” in the INA. 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229a(a)(3). \n94.  The INA’s “exclusive procedure” and statutory protections apply to any removal \nof a noncitizen from the United States, including removals authorized by the AEA. \n95.  The AEA Process creates an alternative removal mechanism outside of the \nimmigration laws set forth by Congress in Title 8. \n96.  Because the AEA Process provides for the removal of Petitioner and the class \nwithout the procedures specified in the INA, it violates the INA. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum \n(All Respondents) \n \n97.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n98.  The INA provides, with certain exceptions, that “[a]ny alien who is physically \npresent in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated \n23 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 24 of 28\nport of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been \ninterdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply \nfor asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.” 8 \nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). \n99.  Respondents’ application of the AEA Process to Petitioner and the class prevents \nthem from applying for asylum in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) and is therefore \ncontrary to law. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n   \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal \n(All Respondents) \n \n100.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n101.  With certain limited exceptions, the “withholding of removal” statute, INA § \n241(b)(3), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), bars the removal of noncitizens to a country where \nit is more likely than not that they would face persecution. \n102.  Respondents’ AEA Process violates the withholding of removal statute because it \ndoes not provide adequate safeguards to ensure that Petitioner and the class are not returned to a \ncountry where it is more likely than not that they would face persecution. As a result, \nRespondents’ actions against Petitioner and the class are contrary to law. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nViolation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), \ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note \n(All Respondents) \n \n103.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n24 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 25 of 28\n104.  FARRA prohibits the government from returning a noncitizen to a country where \nit is more likely than not that he would face torture. \n105.  Respondents’ AEA Process violates FARRA because it does not provide adequate \nsafeguards to ensure that Petitioner and the class are not returned to a country where it is more \nlikely than not that they would face torture. As a result, Respondents’ actions against Petitioner \nand the class are contrary to law. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22  \n(All Respondents) \n \n106.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n107.  The AEA requires that noncitizens whose removal is authorized by the AEA, \nunless “chargeable with actual hostility, or other crime against the public safety,” be allowed the \nfull time stipulated by treaty to depart or a reasonable time in which to settle their affairs before \ndeparting. See 50 U.S.C. § 22. The Proclamation on its face denies Petitioner and the class any \ntime under Section 22 to settle their affairs, because it declares everyone subject to the \nProclamation to be “chargeable with actual hostility” and to be a “danger to public safety.” \n108.  The government cannot invoke that exception categorically, without \nindividualized assessments. Each noncitizen must specifically be “chargeable with actual \nhostility” or a crime against public safety to lose eligibility for voluntary departure. \n109.  The AEA Process thus contravenes 50 U.S.C. § 22 and is ultra vires. \n110.  The application of the AEA Process to Petitioner and the class is contrary to law. \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment \n25 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 26 of 28\n(All Respondents) \n \n111.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n112.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides in relevant part that: \n“No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. \nConst. amend. V. \n113.  In denying Petitioner and the class meaningful procedural protections to challenge \nhis removal, the Proclamation violates due process. \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Habeas Corpus \n(All Respondents) \n \n114.  Detained people have the right to file petitions for habeas corpus to challenge the \nlegality of their removal under the Proclamation. \n115.  The summary removal of Petitioner and the class under the Proclamation violates \ntheir right to habeas corpus. See 28 U.S.C. § 2241; U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2 (Suspension \nClause). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays this Court to: \na.  Assume jurisdiction over this matter; \nb.  Certify this action on behalf of the proposed Petitioner Class, appoint the Petitioner as \nclass representative, and appoint undersigned counsel from the American Civil Liberties \nUnion and the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas as class counsel; \nc.  Grant a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo pending further \nproceedings; \n26 \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 27 of 28\nd.  Enjoin Respondents from transferring Petitioner and the class out of this district during \nthe pendency of this litigation without advance notice to counsel; \ne.  Enjoin Respondents from removing Petitioner and the class pursuant to the Proclamation. \nf.  Grant a writ of habeas corpus to Petitioner and the class that enjoins Respondents \nremoving them pursuant to the Proclamation; \ng.  Declare unlawful the Proclamation; \nh.  Enjoin Respondents from applying the Proclamation to Petitioner and the class without \nproviding 30-day notice of and an opportunity to respond to any designation as an alien \nenemy under the Proclamation prior to the removal date; \ni.  Award Petitioner’s counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice \nAct, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and \nj.

The President has \ninvoked a war power, the AEA, in an attempt to summarily remove noncitizens from the United \nStates and bypass the immigration laws that Congress has enacted. That invocation is patently \nunlawful: It violates the statutory terms of the AEA; unlawfully bypasses the INA; and infringes \non noncitizens’ constitutional right to Due Process under the Fifth Amendment.  \nPetitioner-Plaintiff (“Petitioner”) seeks to certify the following class under Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): \nAll noncitizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are, or will \nbe subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the \nAlien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De \nAragua’ and/or its implementation. \n \nThe proposed class readily satisfies the requirements of Rule 23. \n  Numerosity is present, as demonstrated by the number of people in the United States that \nthe government has admitted having designated as subject to the AEA Proclamation. See Cerna \nDecl. ¶ 6, J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-766-JEB (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025), ECF No. 28-1 (identifying \na total of 258 people in the United States who the government believes are TdA members). \nAdditionally, people who were, are, or will be designated as subject to the AEA Proclamation are \ndetained  and  confined  in  the  Western  District  of  Texas.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the \ngovernment has in the past weeks transferred Venezuelan people, including Named Petitioner, \nfrom detention centers all over the country to Texas, despite their pending removal proceedings in \nimmigration court. Dozens of Venezuelans were nearly removed out of northern Texas in mid-\nApril, but for the Supreme Court’s last-minute stay on their removal. Dozens of Venezuelans \ncurrently remain in custody in the Western District of Texas. The government has also stated in \n \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 3 of 19\nongoing briefing in a related case in this District that an injunction covering those who “will be” \nsubject to the AEA “likely includes every detained noncitizen in the Western District of Texas.” \nMot. to Stay Pending Appeal at 3, Sanchez Puentes v. Garite, No.  3:25-cv-00127-DB (W.D. Tex. \nfiled May 3, 2025), ECF No. 36, thus essentially conceding numerosity.  \nAll class members suffer the same injury: unlawful removal under the AEA, unlawful \ndenial of their statutory rights to the removal and detention procedures contained in the INA, and \nviolation of their right to due process. And the class raises common questions that will generate \ncommon answers, including whether the Proclamation and its implementation violate the AEA, \nthe INA, and the statutory protections for asylum seekers. The Petitioner’s legal claims are typical \nof those whom she seeks to represent. Petitioner is represented by experienced counsel with \nsignificant experience litigating class actions and cases involving the rights of noncitizens. And \nthe proposed class satisfies Rule 23(b)(2) because Respondents have acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class by summarily removing noncitizens without statutorily \nand constitutionally mandated safeguards. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 \n(2011); see also Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354, 367 (5th Cir. 2017). The class would be amenable \nto uniform group remedies, such as granting a writ of habeas corpus that enjoins Respondents from \nremoving Petitioner and the class pursuant to the Proclamation, declaring the Proclamation \nunlawful, and enjoining the Respondents from applying the Proclamation without appropriate \nnotice and opportunity to respond. Id. For these reasons, multiple courts have already certified \nsimilar classes in districts across the county. See J.A.V. v. Trump, No. 1:25-CV-072, --- F.R.D. ---\n-, 2025 WL 1256996, at *6 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025); D.B.U. v. Trump, No. 1:25-CV-01163-CNS, \n--- F.R.D. ----, 2025 WL 1304198, at *10 (D. Colo. May 6, 2025) G.F.F. v. Trump, No. 25 CIV. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 4 of 19\n2886 (AKH), --- F.R.D. ----, 2025 WL 1166482, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2025), amended 2025 \nWL 1166909 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 11, 2025). \n  The lack of notice to individuals and undersigned counsel reinforces why certification of a \ndistrict-wide class is necessary in this case. While the government has identified hundreds of \nindividuals who could be removed subject to the Proclamation, it has refused to disclose the \nidentity and location of such individuals. Given that the government is, on information and belief, \ncurrently detaining Venezuelan people from all over the country in this District, more people will \nlikely be subject to summary removal pursuant to the Proclamation. Supra. Proceeding with a \ndistrict-wide class would thus serve the purpose of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. See William \nB. Rubenstein, Newberg and Rubenstein on Class Actions § 4:35 (6th ed.) (discussing “critical \nsafeguards for class members that certification alone can provide”).   \nThe Court should grant class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), appoint the Petitioner as \nClass Representative, and appoint the undersigned as Class Counsel. Alternatively, the Court can \nuse Rule 23 as a guidepost to certify a class under principles of habeas jurisdiction and equity.  \nEvery circuit that has addressed the issue has found that a class habeas action may be maintained.  \nSee, e.g., U.S. ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115 (2d Cir. 1974); Bijeol v. Benson, 513 F.2d \n965, 967 (7th Cir. 1975), Williams v. Richardson, 481 F.2d 358 (8th Cir. 1973); Mead v. Parker, \n464 F.2d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 1972); Napier v. Gertrude, 542 F.2d 825, 827 & n.5 (10th Cir. \n1976); LoBue v. Christopher, 82 F.3d 1081, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see also J.A.V., 2025 WL \n1256996, at *2 (adopting the reasoning from this caselaw). \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 5 of 19\nBACKGROUND \nI.  President Trump’s Proclamation Invoking the AEA \nThe background of this litigation is set forth in greater detail in Petitioner’s simultaneously \nfiled Habeas Petition and Complaint and Motion for a TRO. On March 14, the President signed \nthe AEA Proclamation at issue here. It provides that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or \nolder who are members of TdA [Tren de Aragua], are within the United States, and are not actually \nnaturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, \nrestrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.” See Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act \nRegarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua (Mar. 15, 2025).1 Although the \nAEA calls for a “public proclamation,” 50 U.S.C. § 21, the administration did not make the \ninvocation public until around 3:53 p.m. EDT on March 15. See J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5067, \n2025 WL 914682, at *17 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025); J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-766-JEB, 2025 \nWL 890401, at *3 (D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2025). \nIn mid-March 2025, the government identified 86 people in detention subject to the \nProclamation and 172 more who are at liberty in the United States. See supra, Cerna Decl. ¶ 6. \nThat number has very likely grown since the government stated that “ICE carefully tracks the TdA \nmembers who are amenable to removal proceedings,” id., and continues to engage in enforcement \nactions against alleged TdA members, see Secretary Krist Noem, X.com (Apr. 25, 2025, 9:24AM \nET)2 (stating that under this administration, “more than 600 members” of TdA have been arrested). \nYet, counsel for Petitioner have learned about AEA designations primarily when large groups of \nVenezuelans were transferred from detention centers all over the country to Texas to be staged for \n \n1 https://perma.cc/ZS8M-ZQHJ. \n2 https://perma.cc/NS6N-VNTB. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 6 of 19\nswift removals, despite their pending immigration proceedings. Over 130 of those individuals have \nalready been disappeared into the infamous Salvadoran prison, CECOT. Another group were \nnearly removed in a similar manner on April 18, but for emergency applications for a stay of \nremoval to the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court. See A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 145 S. Ct. 1034 (2025). \nUpon information and belief, dozens of Venezuelans are detained in this District and have either \nalready received or will soon receive notice of alien enemy designation. Thus, many individuals \nin this District are at imminent risk of summary removal and face the same irreparable, devastating \noutcome as those removed on March 15, with the Court potentially permanently losing jurisdiction. \nII.  Named Petitioner and the Proposed Class \n   Petitioner is a noncitizen from Venezuela, accused of affiliation with Tren de Aragua, who \nis currently detained at the El Paso Processing Center in El Paso, Texas. See generally ECF No. 1, \nClass Pet. Petitioner is representative of other noncitizens subject to the Proclamation under the \nAlien Enemies Act because she is in civil detention by ICE, has received a notice designating her \nfor removal under the Alien Enemies Act based on an alleged affiliation with Tren de Aragua, and \nis thus at risk of removal based on the Proclamation. The proposed class does not include \nindividuals who may be removed pursuant to other authorities, such as the immigration laws.   \nARGUMENT \n  A plaintiff whose suit satisfies the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 has \na “categorical” right “to pursue his claim as a class action.” Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. \nv. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 398 (2010). The “suit must satisfy the criteria set forth in \n[Rule 23(a)] (i.e., numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation), and it \nalso must fit into one of the three categories described in subdivision (b).” Id; see also Shelton v. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 7 of 19\nBledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 562 (3d Cir. 2015). As set forth below, Petitioner’s proposed class satisfies \nall four of the Rule 23(a) requirements. \n  Petitioner also demonstrates below that Respondents “ha[ve] acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory \nrelief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole,” as required under Rule 23(b)(2). “[A] single \ninjunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class,” and \ntherefore certification is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2). See Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S.at 360; \nsee also Yates, 868 F.3d at 367. \nThe Fifth Circuit has instructed that courts entertaining class actions to vindicate civil rights \nshould not apply rules about the burden of proof “rigidly or blindly.” Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott \n& Co., Inc., 651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. 1981) (quoting Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d 1090, 1099 \n(5th Cir. 1975)). \nI.  THE PROPOSED CLASS SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 23(a) \nA.  The Proposed Class is So Numerous That Joinder is Impracticable. \nThe proposed class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(1). There is no fixed number of class or subclass members required for a finding of \nnumerosity. Zeidman, 651 F.2d at 1038–39 (“federal trial courts are quite willing to accept \ncommon sense assumptions in order to support a finding of numerosity”) (quoting 5 J. Newberg, \nClass Actions § 8812, at 836 (1977)). \n Instead, the key question is “whether joinder of all members is practicable in view of the \nnumerosity of the class and all other relevant factors.” Id. at 1038 (quoting Phillips v. Joint \nLegislative Comm., 637 F.2d 1014, 1022 (5th Cir. 1981)). These other relevant factors include “the \ngeographical dispersion of the class, the ease with which class members may be identified, the \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 8 of 19\nnature of the action, and the size of each Plaintiff’s claim.” Id. (citation omitted). Courts also \nconsider the “financial resources of class members, and the ability of claimants to institute \nindividual suits,” as well as the “judicial economy arising from the avoidance of a multiplicity of \nactions.” William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 3:12 (5th ed. 2017). Finally, “the \nfact  that  the  class  includes  unknown,  unnamed  future  members  also  weighs  in  favor  of \ncertification.” Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 868 n.11 (5th Cir. 2000) (citing Jack v. \nAm. Linen Supply Co., 498 F.2d 122, 124 (5th Cir. 1974)). \n“The general rule encouraging liberal construction of civil rights class actions applies with \nequal force to the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1),” and “[s]maller classes are less \nobjectionable where . . . the plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief on behalf of future class members \nas well as past and present members.” Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d 1090, 1100 (5th Cir. 1975), \nabrogated on other grounds, Gardner v. Westinghouse Broad. Co., 437 U.S. 478 (1978). Joinder \nis presumptively impracticable when a class consists of forty members or more. Mullen v. Treasure \nChest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing Newberg on Class Actions, supra, § \n3:11). \nThe proposed class easily satisfies the numerosity requirement. Nearly two months ago, \nafter already removing over 130 people to El Salvador, the government identified about 250 \nindividuals subject to the Proclamation in the United States. See supra, Cerna Decl. ¶ 6. At the end \nof April, the government stated it had arrested over 600 members of TdA. See supra. Based on \nthese numbers alone, Petitioner clears the bar, but more importantly, there are likely to be more \nindividuals entering the class as more individuals are taken into custody. Because ICE continues \nto “track[] the TdA members who are amenable to removal proceedings,” id., “the class includes \nunknown, unnamed future members.” Pederson, 213 F.3d at 868 n.11; see also Jack, 498 F.2d at \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 9 of 19\n124 (discussing impracticability of joinder of unknown persons); Phillips v. Joint Legislative \nComm. on Performance & Expenditure Review, 637 F.2d 1014, 1022 (5th Cir. 1981) (“joinder of \nunknown  individuals  is  ‘certainly  impracticable’”).  As  Judge  Rodriguez  noted  in  finding \nnumerosity in a similar case in the Southern District of Texas, “Respondents have the ability to \ntransfer a significant number of unidentified Venezuelan [noncitizens] into the [District], designate \nthem as alien enemies under the Proclamation, and subject them to removal under the AEA. . . . \nThe fact that these individuals currently remain unknown further precludes their joinder.” J.A.V., \n2025 WL 1256996, at *3. \nJoinder is impracticable not only because of the sheer numbers, but also because class \nmembers are frequently dispersed in different detention facilities prior to rapid staging for removal.  \nId. (“Respondents could utilize detention facilities for these purposes throughout the Southern \nDistrict of Texas, rendering joinder impracticable due to the geographic dispersion.”); see also \nJ.D. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 1291, 1323 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (stating that joinder may be impracticable in \nlight of “fluidity” of custody, “the dispersion of class members across the country, and their limited \nresources”); see also, e.g., Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir. \n1999)  (joinder  impracticable  where  class  members  were  “transient”  and  “geographically \ndispersed”); Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott & Co., Inc., 651 F.2d 1080, 1038 (5th Cir. 1981) \n(geographic dispersion relevant to impracticability of joinder); Steward v. Janek, 315 F.R.D. 472, \n480 (W.D. Tex. 2016) (same). Joinder is further impracticable given the nature of the class. \nChisholm v. Jindal, No. 97-CV-3274, 1998 WL 92272, at *3 (E.D. La. Mar. 2, 1998) (finding \njoinder impracticable, “especially in light of the fact that [the putative class members] are \nindigent”); see also G.F.F., 2025 WL 1166482, at *2 (joinder impractical given detained people’s \n“limited access to counsel”). \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 10 of 19\nB.  Members of the Class Have Common Questions of Law and Fact. \nThe claims asserted by the proposed class include common questions of law and fact that \nsatisfy Rule 23(a)(2). At bottom, “[c]ommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class \nmembers ‘have suffered the same injury.’” Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 349–50 (quoting Gen. \nTel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)). “To satisfy the commonality requirement \nunder Rule 23(a)(2), class members must raise at least one contention that is central to the validity \nof each class member’s claims.” In re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d 790, 810 (5th Cir. 2014). \nEven a single common question of law or fact is sufficient, so long as the resolution of the common \nquestion “will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the class member’s \nclaims in one stroke.” Cole v. Livingston, 4:14-CV-1698, 2016 WL 3258345, at *3 (S.D. Tex. June \n14, 2016), aff’d sub nom., Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 2017).  A “pattern or practice \nthat is generally applicable to the class as a whole” satisfies that requirement.  M.D. v. Perry, 294 \nF.R.D. 7, 28 (S.D. Tex. 2013). \nPetitioner in this case has identified a “single course of conduct”—the unlawful removal \nof noncitizens under the AEA—that provides the basis for every class member’s injury. M.D., 294 \nF.R.D. at 28-29; see also Valentine v. Collier, 490 F. Supp. 3d 1121, 1158 (S.D. Tex. 2020), rev’d \non other grounds, 993 F.3d 270 (5th Cir. 2021) (commonality met where “[e]ither the answer to \nthis  question  is  ‘yes,’  in  which  case  [defendants  are]  required  to  provide  that  specific \naccommodation for the entire subclass, or the answer is ‘no,’ in which case class-wide relief is not \nwarranted. But either way, the answer to that question can be resolved with respect to every . . . \nclass member at once.”).  \nIn addition to this common injury, numerous questions are common to the proposed class: \nwhether the removals go beyond the power granted to the President under the AEA; whether the \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 11 of 19\nremovals  violate  statutory  and  regulatory  immigration  removal  procedures;  and  whether \nRespondents’ denial of meaningful procedural protections to challenge class members’ removal \nviolates the AEA and Fifth Amendment. See J.A.V., 2025 WL 1256996, at *4 (“These issues hold \ntrue for any individual that Respondents designate as an alien enemy under the Proclamation and \nsubject to removal under the AEA.”). Any one of these common issues, standing alone, is enough \nto satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s permissive standard. See id.; see also Yates, 868 F.3d at 365 n.6 (“we \nreaffirm that Rule 23(a)(2) requires only that a plaintiff demonstrate at least one common question \nof law or fact” (citing Dukes, 564 U.S. at 359)); Simms v. Jones, 296 F.R.D. 485, 497 (N.D. Tex. \n2013) (same). And while class members may present individualized defenses to their designation \nas alien enemies, “this ‘obvious fact does not destroy commonality’” for purposes of addressing \nthese common questions. Valentine, 490 F. Supp. 3d at 1159 (citing Yates, 868 F.3d at 363).   \nAnswering any one of these common legal questions will “drive the resolution of the \nlitigation.” Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350. Should the Court agree that Respondents cannot \nlawfully remove noncitizens under the AEA because there has, for instance, been no “invasion or \npredatory incursion” by a “foreign government or nation,” all class members will benefit from the \nrequested  relief,  which  includes  a  declaration  to  that  effect  and  an  injunction  preventing \nRespondents from conducting the removals. Should the government’s use of the AEA be upheld \nby this Court and on appeal, then at that point individual habeas actions may be needed to address \nwhether any given detained person is, on the particular facts, a TdA member who falls with the \nProclamation. But at this stage, a class action is the appropriate means of addressing the threshold \nsystemic issues that affect all class members. See J.A.V., 2025 WL 1256996, at *4-5 (finding \ncommonality despite individualized claims) (citing In re Deepwater, 739 F.3d at 810).   \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 12 of 19\nC.  Petitioner’s Claims Are Typical of Class Members’ Claims. \nPetitioner here has claims typical of the proposed class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). The \ntypicality requirement ensures that the absent class members are adequately represented by the \nlead plaintiffs such that the interests of the class will be fairly and adequately protected in their \nabsence. Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13 (1982).  “[T]he test for typicality \nis not demanding,” Mullen, 186 F.3d at 625, and “does not require a complete identity of claims.” \nJames v. City of Dallas, Tex., 254 F.3d 551, 571 (5th Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds in \nIn re Rodriguez, 695 F.3d 360 (5th Cir. 2012) (citing 5 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal \nPractice ¶ 23.24[4] (3d ed. 2000). Rather, the class representative’s claim must have the same \nessential characteristics as that of the putative class. Morrow v. Washington, 277 F.R.D. 172, 194 \n(E.D. Tex. 2011). Claims arising from a similar course of conduct and sharing the same legal \ntheories are typical claims even if there is factual difference between the representative and others \nin the class. James, 254 F.3d at 571. \nTypicality is satisfied here for largely the same reasons that commonality is satisfied. See \nWal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5 (“The commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) \ntend to merge” (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157 n. 13). Each proposed class member, including \nthe proposed class representatives, faces the same principal injury (unlawful removal), based on \nthe same government policy (invocation of the AEA), which is unlawful as to the entire class \nbecause it violates the AEA itself, as well as the immigration laws and the Constitution. Petitioner \nthus shares an identical interest in invalidation of Respondents’ implementation of removals \npursuant  to  the  Proclamation.  See  J.A.V.,  2025  WL  1256996,  at  *5.  Moreover,  as  with \ncommonality, any factual differences that might exist here between Petitioners and proposed class \nmembers are not enough to defeat typicality. Id. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 13 of 19\nD.  Petitioner and Petitioner’s Counsel Will Adequately Protect The Interests Of \nThe Proposed Class. \n \nPetitioner  and  undersigned  counsel  also  fulfill  the  final  requirement  that  “[t]he \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(4). The adequacy of representation inquiry has two components: (i) whether the attorneys \nretained by the named plaintiffs are qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the \nlitigation; and (ii) whether the named plaintiffs have interests that are antagonistic to or in conflict \nwith those they seek to represent.  Berger v. Compaq Computer Corp., 257 F.3d 475, 481 (5th Cir. \n2001). \nHere, there are no differences that create conflicts between the named Petitioner’s interests \nand the class members’ interests. Petitioner will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nproposed class. Petitioner does not seek any unique or additional benefit from this litigation that \nmay make her interests different from or adverse to those of absent class members. Instead, \nPetitioner aims to secure relief that will protect her and the entire class from Respondents’ \nchallenged policy and to enjoin Respondents from further violations. Petitioner has no incentive \nto deviate from this class relief. Nor does Petitioner seek financial gain at the cost of absent class \nmembers’ rights. There are no differences that “create conflicts between the proposed class \nrepresentatives’ interests and the class members’ interests.” Mullen, 186 F.3d at 625–26; see also \nJenkins v. Raymark Industries, Inc., 782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 1986). \nIn  addition,  proposed  class  counsel  includes  experienced  attorneys  with  extensive \nexperience in complex immigration cases and class action litigation. See Galindo Decl. ¶¶ 1-11. \nAs the declaration makes clear, Proposed Class Counsel have been appointed class counsel in \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 14 of 19\nseveral successful class action cases concerning the rights of noncitizens and others. See, e.g., id. \n¶¶ 4, 7.3  \nII.  THE PROPOSED CLASS SATISFIES RULE 23(b)’S REQUIREMENTS \nRule 23 requires that, in addition to satisfying the requirements of Rule 23(a), a putative \nclass must also fall within one of the parts of subsection (b). Yates, 868 F.3d at 366. Petitioner here \nseeks class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which provides that a class action is appropriate when \n“the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the \nclass as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \n The Fifth Circuit instructs that Rule 23(b)(2) “was intended primarily to facilitate civil \nrights class actions, where the class representatives typically sought broad injunctive or declaratory \nrelief against discriminatory practices.” Penson v. Terminal Transp. Co., 634 F.2d 989, 993 (5th \nCir. 1981) (citing Advisory Committee Notes, 39 F.R.D. 98, 102 (1966)).  Thus, courts in the Fifth \nCircuit have certified under Rule 23(b)(2) similar classes of individuals subject to restrictive \nimmigration-related policies. See, e.g., Murillo v. Musegades, 809 F. Supp. 487, 503 (W.D. Tex. \n1992) (certifying all individuals of Hispanic descent who reside, are employed, attend school or \ntravel  within  a  specific  Texas  school  subject  to  unlawful  stops,  searches  and  detention  by \n \n3 District courts in the Fifth Circuit consider ascertainability an “implied requirement to Rule 23,” \n“require[ing] that the proposed class be adequately defined and clearly ascertainable.” Ictech-\nBendeck v. Waste Connections Bayou, Inc., No. CV 18-7889, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL \n932772, at *7 (E.D. La. Mar. 27, 2025) (citing Braidwood Mgmt., Inc. v. Equal Emp. Opportunity \nComm’n, 70 F.4th 914, 933 (5th Cir. 2023)). “‘[T]he touchstone of ascertainability is whether the \nclass is sufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether \na particular individual is a member.’” Id. (citation omitted).  The proposed class here is readily \nascertainable because membership in the class is defined by clear and objective criteria that are \nknown to the government and because identifying class members is administratively feasible, as \ndemonstrated by the government’s declaration in J.G.G. describing their identification of TdA \nmembers. Supra. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 15 of 19\nimmigration officers); ODonnell v. Harris Cnty., No. CV H-16-1414, 2017 WL 1542457, at *1 \n(S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2017) (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) class of misdemeanor arrestees who cannot \nafford monetary bail due to indigency, asserting violation of Equal Protection and Due Process).4  \n“The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy \nwarranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as \nto all of the class members or as to none of them.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360. \nRule 23(b)(2) is satisfied here because Respondents have acted on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class by subjecting them all to the same Proclamation and attempting to summarily \nremove them without complying with the AEA, INA and due process. See J.AV., 2025 WL \n1256996, at *6; see also Yates, 868 F.3d at 366 (“It is well-established that instead of requiring \ncommon issues, Rule 23(b)(2) requires common behavior by the defendant toward the class.”) \n(quoting In re Rodriguez, 695 F.3d 360, 365 (5th Cir. 2012)). Petitioner seeks injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief that would benefit her as well as all members of the proposed class in the same \nfashion. “The relief Petitioners seek is precisely the type of remedial action for which Rule 23(b)(2) \nwas designed.” Murillo, 809 F. Supp. 487 at 503 (citing Penson, 634 F.2d 993); see also Newberg \non Class Actions, supra, § 1:3 (“Rule 23(b)(2) is typically employed in civil rights cases and other \nactions not primarily seeking money damages. The (b)(2) class action is often referred to as a ‘civil \nrights’ or ‘injunctive’ class suit.”). \nThe class is exactly the kind of class that Rule 23(b)(2) is meant to embrace. The class’s \ninterests are sufficiently related to warrant aggregate litigation. This is especially the case because \n \n4 See also, e.g., Aguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, 973 F.2d 411, 415, 421 (5th Cir. 1992) (class action \nhabeas petition challenging detention of noncitizen witnesses where government opposed class \ncertification based only on typicality and mootness); Vietnamese Fishermen’s Ass’n v. Knights of \nthe Ku Klux Klan, 543 F. Supp. 198, 202 (S.D. Tex. 1982) (noting class of all Vietnamese \nfishermen subject to civil rights violations by Ku Klux Klan and Texas Emergency Reserve). \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 16 of 19\nmembers of the proposed class are in detention, often lack immigration counsel, and are indigent; \nthey may also be detained in various facilities across the country and are therefore very unlikely \nto bring their own individual suits. It is far more efficient for this Court to grant injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief protecting all the class members than to force individuals to pursue piecemeal \nlitigation, especially as the government has already announced its plans to swiftly deport people \nbefore they have the opportunity to seek judicial intervention. \nIII.  ALTERNATIVELY, A CLASS CAN ALSO BE CERTIFIED UNDER HABEAS \nEQUITY PRINCILES. \n   A habeas class may be maintained either under Rule 23 or in equity informed by Rule 23 \nprinciples. See, e.g., Sero, 506 F.2d at 1125 (the Supreme Court “confirms the power of the \njudiciary, under the All Writs Act, . . . to fashion for habeas actions ‘appropriate modes of \nprocedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage’” (citing \nHarris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286 (1960)); Bijeol, 513 F.2d at 968 (agreeing with Sero that “a \nrepresentative procedure analogous to the class action provided for in Rule 23 may be appropriate \nin a habeas corpus action” like the one at issue), Williams, 481 F.2d at 361 (“under certain \ncircumstances a class action provides an appropriate procedure to resolve the claims of a group of \npetitioners and avoid unnecessary duplication of judicial efforts”); Mead, 464 F.2d at 1112–13 ( \n“there can be cases, and this is one of them, where the relief sought can be of immediate benefit to \na  large  and  amorphous  group.  In such  cases,  it  has  been  held that  a  class  action  may  be \nappropriate”); LoBue, 82 F.3d at 1085 (“If . . . he meant to claim that there is no equivalent to class \nactions in habeas, he was wrong, for courts have in fact developed such equivalents.”); Napier, \n542 F.2d at 827 & n.5 (recognizing “class treatment” with “reference to Rule 23 in proper \ncircumstances”); see also Hamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 879 (6th Cir. 2018) (noting that \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 17 of 19\nclasswide habeas still available notwithstanding INA provision barring classwide injunctive \nrelief).  \n   The Fifth Circuit, as a descriptive matter, has considered class habeas cases. See, e.g., \nAguilar-Ayala v. Ruiz, 973 F.2d 411, 421 (5th Cir. 1992) (habeas class of noncitizen witnesses \nchallenging government practice of detention over ten days, where government has opposed \ncertification based on mootness and lack of typicality); St. Jules v. Savage, 512 F.2d 881, 882 (5th \nCir. 1975) (reversing dismissal and remanding where district court held that each petitioner’s \nchallenge  had  to  be  “considering  individually”  because  those  inmates  “present  a  single \nconstitutional challenge”); In re Class Action Application for Habeas Corpus on Behalf of All \nMaterial Witnesses in W. Dist. of Texas, 612 F. Supp. 940, 948 (W.D. Tex. 1985) (granting \nsummary judgment to class of individuals detained as material witnesses in the Western District \nof Texas). Additionally, the Supreme Court has ruled on the merits in class habeas cases. See, e.g., \nJohnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. 523, 532 (2021); Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. 392, 400 (2019); \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 290 (2018).  \n  Most recently, Judge Rodriguez surveyed the case law on class habeas from other circuits \nand agreed that under the circumstances here, it was appropriate to rely on the All Writs Act to \nfashion relief analogous to a class action. See J.A.V., 2025 WL 1256996, at *1-2, 5-6. Specifically, \nhe noted that in this context, with individuals detained in multiple detention facilities across the \ndistrict, “requiring individualized habeas corpus proceedings to repeatedly address the common \nlegal issues unduly wastes judicial resources.” Id. at *6. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 2-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 18 of 19\nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should certify the proposed Class under Rule 23(a) and 23(b)(2) or in equity, \nappoint the Petitioner as Class Representative, and appoint the American Civil Liberties Union \nand the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas as Class Counsel.  \nDated: May 10, 2025   Respectfully submitted,  \nLee Gelernt*  /s/ Adriana Pinon \nDaniel Galindo*  Adriana Piñon \nAshley Gorski*  TX Bar No. 24089768 \nPatrick Toomey*  Brian Klosterboer \nSidra Mahfooz*  Tx Bar No.  24107833 \nOmar Jadwat*  Thomas Buser-Clancy \nHina Shamsi*  TX Bar No. 24078344 \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION  Savannah Kumar* \nFOUNDATION   TX Bar No. 24120098 \n125 Broad Street, 18th Floor   Charelle Lett \nNew York, NY 10004   TX Bar No. 24138899 \nT: (212) 549-2660   Ashley Harris \nE: lgelernt@aclu.org   TX Bar No. 24123238 \nE: dgalindo@aclu.org   ACLU FOUNDATION OF TEXAS, \nE: agorski@aclu.org    INC. \nE: ptoomey@aclu.org    1018 Preston St. \nE: smahfooz@aclu.org   Houston, TX 77002 \nE: ojadwat@aclu.org   (713) 942-8146 \nE: hshamsi@aclu.org    bklosterboer@aclutx.org \n  tbuser-clancy@aclutx.org \nNoelle Smith*  skumar@aclutx.org \nOscar Sarabia Roman*  clett@aclutx.org \nMy Khanh Ngo*  aharris@aclutx.org \nCody Wofsy*  apinon@aclutx.org \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION   \nFOUNDATION   Yulie Landan*± \n425 California Street, Suite 700   Matthew S.

A court in this \nDistrict, in the related case, Sanchez Puentes v. Garite (No. 25-cv-127), currently has an injunction \nagainst  removals  without  proper  notice  pursuant  to  the  Alien  Enemies  Act  and  Petitioner \nrespectfully requests that if that order is stayed, the Court grant a TRO for Petitioner and the \nputative class in this action.  \nIn a Proclamation signed on March 14 and published on March 15, the President invoked \na war power, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (“AEA”), to summarily remove noncitizens from the \nU.S. and bypass the immigration laws Congress has enacted. See Invocation of the Alien Enemies \nAct (Mar. 15, 2025) (“Proclamation”).1 The AEA permits the President to invoke the AEA only \nwhere the United States is in a “declared war” with a “foreign government or nation” or a ‘foreign \ngovernment or nation” is threatening to, or has engaged in, an “invasion or predatory incursion” \nagainst the “territory of the United States.” The Proclamation targets Venezuelan noncitizens \naccused of being part of Tren de Aragua (“TdA”), a criminal gang, and claims that the gang is \nengaged in an “invasion and predatory incursion” within the meaning of the AEA. \nOn the evening of March 15, a D.C. District Court issued an order temporarily pausing \nremovals pursuant to the Proclamation for a provisionally certified nationwide class. J.G.G. v. \nTrump, No. 25-5067, 2025 WL 914682, at *2 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025). The D.C. Circuit denied \nthe government’s motion to vacate that TRO. On April 7, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court \ngranted the government’s application to vacate the TRO order on the basis that those plaintiffs had \n \n1 https://perma.cc/ZS8M-ZQHJ. \n2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 3 of 28\nto proceed through habeas, without reaching the merits of whether the Proclamation exceeds the \nPresident’s power under the AEA. In doing so, however, the Court emphasized that individuals \nwho are designated under the AEA Proclamation are “entitle[d] to due process” and notice “within \na reasonable time and in such manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief” before \nremoval. Trump v. J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1006 (2025). \nIn light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, courts across the country have enjoined removals \nand transfers of people who are detained in their districts and designated or at risk of imminent \ndesignation as alien enemies pursuant to the Proclamation. See, e.g., J.A.V. v. Trump, No. 1:25-\nCV-072, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1257450, at *20 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025); D.B.U. v. Trump, \nNo. 1:25-CV-01163-CNS, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1304288, at *10 (D. Colo. May 6, 2025); \nG.F.F. v. Trump, No. 25 CIV. 2886 (AKH), --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1301052, at *11 \n(S.D.N.Y. May 6, 2025); Sanchez Puentes v. Garite, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 1203179, *17 \n(W.D. Tex. Apr. 25, 2025); A.S.R. v. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1208275, *4 (W.D. Pa. \nApr. 25, 2025). \nDespite the Supreme Court’s clear instructions, the government has since made one other \nknown  attempt  to  remove  a  large  number  of  individuals  under  the  Proclamation  without \nmeaningful notice. From April 17 to 18, the government gave detained people at Bluebonnet \nDetention Center in Texas an English-only AEA designation form, not provided to any attorney, \nwhich nowhere mentioned the right to contest the designation or removal. See Emergency Appl. \nfor an Emergency Inj. or Writ of Mandamus at 4–8, A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 145 S. Ct. 1034 (Mem.) \n(filed Apr. 18, 2025). ICE officers told detained people that they would be removed on April 18. \nId. at 5; see also Cisneros Decl., J.A.V. v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00072 (S.D. Tex. filed Apr. 24, \n2025), ECF No. 49-1 (attached as Exhibit A), at 5 (Form AEA-21B). Petitioners’ counsel in that \n3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 4 of 28\ncase sought relief from the district court, the Fifth Circuit, and the Supreme Court. Vehicles with \ndozens of Venezuelan men that left the detention facility were turned around after those filings, \nand the Supreme Court issued a stay on removals for the putative class in the Northern District of \nTexas at 12:51 a.m. EDT on Saturday, April 19. A.A.R.P., 145 S. Ct. at 1034. \nAfter  that  order  was  entered,  Respondents’  process  for  providing  notice  of  AEA \ndesignations was made public, although the government sought to keep it under seal. See Exh. A \n(Cisneros Decl.); Oral Order, J.A.V. v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00072 (S.D. Tex., entered at 4:26 PM \nCT, Apr. 24, 2025) (unsealing the declaration). Detained people must express an intent to file a \nhabeas petition challenging their designation within the first 12 hours or they can be removed; if \nthey express an intent to file a habeas petition, they are given 24 hours to actually file that petition, \nExh. A (Cisneros Decl.) ¶ 11.  \nPetitioner has filed this habeas action following the Supreme Court’s order that those \ndesignated as “alien enemies” must receive due process and the government’s subsequent actions \nto designate individuals as alien enemies and rapidly remove them without meaningful notice. The \nProclamation is invalid under the AEA for multiple reasons. \nFirst, the Proclamation fails to satisfy the AEA’s statutory predicates because TdA is not \na “foreign nation or government,” nor is TdA engaged in an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” \nwithin the meaning of the AEA. Thus, the government’s attempt to summarily remove Venezuelan \nnoncitizens exceeds the wartime authority that Congress delegated. Second, the Proclamation \nviolates both the Act and due process by failing to provide notice and a meaningful opportunity \nfor individuals to challenge their designation as alien enemies. Third, the Proclamation violates \nthe process and protections that Congress has prescribed for the removal of noncitizens in the \nimmigration laws, including protection against being sent to a country where they will be tortured. \n4 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 5 of 28\nAccordingly, Petitioner moves the Court for a TRO for herself and the putative class \nbarring  their  summary  removal  under  the  AEA.2 Upon  information  and  belief,  but  for \nintervention from this Court, transfer for removal is imminent because Petitioner was served \ndocumentation alleging that she is an alien enemy and thus subject to removal under the \nProclamation. Immediate intervention by this Court is required if the existing injunction \nentered in an individual habeas petition filed in this District against AEA removals is stayed. \nIt is especially necessary for members of the putative class given the government’s policy to \nprovide a mere 12 hours’ notice ahead of removal and 24 hours to file a habeas petition, which \ndoes not provide sufficient time for a detained person to challenge their designation. And if there \nis  an  unlawful  removal,  the  government  has taken  the  position that  the  courts  would  lose \njurisdiction  and  there  would  be  no  way  to  correct  any  erroneous  removal.  Indeed,  in  the \ngovernment’s rush to transfer individuals to El Salvador, the government has mistakenly deported \nat least one Salvadoran man without legal basis and claims that individual cannot be returned. See \nNoem v. Abrego Garcia, 145 S. Ct. 1017, 1018 (Apr. 10, 2025). At least one other individual was \nremoved to El Salvador on March 15 in violation of a binding settlement agreement. J.O.P. v. U.S. \nDHS, 2025 WL 1180191 (D. Md. Apr. 23, 2025). Declarations and news accounts suggest that \nmany, if not most, of the alleged TdA members sent to El Salvador pursuant to the Proclamation \nat issue here were not in fact TdA members. See Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., J.G.G., No. 25-cv-766-\nJEB (D.D.C.

See, e.g., Nat’l \nTreasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, 492 F.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (concluding that court had \njurisdiction to issue writ of mandamus against the President but “opt[ing] instead” to issue \ndeclaration). \n5 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 6 of 28\nThe TRO sought here does not seek to prohibit the government from prosecuting any \nindividual who has committed a crime. Nor does it seek release from immigration detention or to \nprohibit the government from removing any individual who may lawfully be removed under the \nimmigration laws. \nLEGAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \nI.  The Alien Enemies Act \n \nThe AEA is a wartime authority that grants the President specific powers with respect to \nthe regulation, detention, and deportation of enemy aliens. Passed in 1798, the AEA, as codified \ntoday at 50 U.S.C. § 21, provides: \nWhenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation \nor government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or \nthreatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or \ngovernment, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all natives, \ncitizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age \nof fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually \nnaturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as \nalien enemies. \n \nThis Act has been used only three times in the country’s history and each time in a period of war—\nthe War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. \nThe Act also provides that individuals designated as enemy aliens will generally have time \nto “settle affairs” before removal and the option to voluntarily “depart.”3 See, e.g., United States \nex rel. Dorfler v. Watkins, 171 F.2d 431, 432 (2d Cir. 1948) (“An alien must be afforded the \nprivilege of voluntary departure before the [AG] can lawfully remove him against his will.”). \n \n3 50 U.S.C. § 21 (providing for removal of only those “alien enemies” who “refuse or neglect to \ndepart” from the U.S.); id. § 22 (granting time for departure in accordance with treaty stipulation \nor “where no such treaty exists, or is in force,” a “reasonable time as may be consistent with the \npublic safety, and according to the dictates of humanity and national hospitality”). \n6 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 7 of 28\nII.  Congress’s Comprehensive Reform of Immigration Law \nFollowing World War II, Congress consolidated U.S. immigration laws into a single text \nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (“INA”). The INA, and its subsequent \namendments, provide a comprehensive system of procedures that the government must follow \nbefore removing a noncitizen from the U.S. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3) (INA provides “sole and \nexclusive procedure” for determining whether noncitizen may be removed).  \nAs part of that reform and other subsequent amendments, Congress prescribed safeguards \nfor noncitizens seeking protection from persecution and torture. These protections codify the \nhumanitarian framework adopted by the United Nations in response to the humanitarian failures \nof World War II. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 439-40 (1987); Aliyev v. Mukasey, \n549 F.3d 111, 118 n.8 (2d Cir. 2008) (“It is no accident that many of our asylum laws sprang forth \nas a result of events in 1930s Europe.”). First, the asylum statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, provides that \nany noncitizen in the U.S. has a right to apply for asylum. Second, the withholding of removal \nstatute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), provides that noncitizens “may not” be removed to a country where \ntheir “life or freedom” would be threatened based on a protected ground. See INS v. Aguirre-\nAguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 420 (1999) (withholding is mandatory upon meeting statutory criteria). \nThird, protections under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) prohibit returning noncitizens \nto a country where it is more likely than not that they would face torture. See Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”) § 2242(a), Pub. L. No. 105-207, Div. G. Title \nXXI, 112 Stat. 2681 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16-.18. \nIII.  The AEA Proclamation and the Unlawful Removals \nOn March 14, the President signed the AEA Proclamation at issue here. It provides that \n“all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United \n7 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 8 of 28\nStates, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable \nto be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.” See Proclamation. \nAlthough the AEA calls for a “public proclamation,” 50 U.S.C. § 21, the administration did not \nmake the invocation public until around 3:53 p.m. on March 15. As set forth more fully in Judge \nBoasberg’s opinion, even prior to the Proclamation’s publication, the government sought to \nremove individuals. J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025), ECF No. 28-\n1 (Cerna Decl.) ¶ 5; J.G.G., 2025 WL 890401, at *3 (D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2025) (noting that prior to \npublication of Proclamation, and after a lawsuit was filed against the removals, it appeared that \n“the Government . . . was nonetheless moving forward with its summary-deportation plans.”). \nIn addition to claiming that a criminal gang during peacetime satisfies the AEA’s statutory \npredicates, the Proclamation does not provide any process for individuals to contest that they are \nmembers  of  the  TdA  and  do  not  therefore  fall  within  the  terms  of  the  Proclamation.  The \nProclamation also supplants the removal process under the congressionally enacted immigration \nlaws, which, among other things, provide a right to seek protection from persecution and torture. \nSee, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3), 1231 note. \nTo date, at least 137 Venezuelan men have been removed under the Proclamation and are \nnow in El Salvador in one of the most notorious prisons in the world, possibly for the rest of their \nlives. Whether most (or perhaps all) of that group lacks ties to TdA remains to be seen, because \nRespondents secretly rushed the men out of the country and have provided no information about \nthem.  But  evidence  since  these  individuals  were  sent  to  El  Salvador  flights  on  March  15 \nincreasingly shows that many were not “members” of TdA. See J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, \nECF  No.  67-21  (Sarabia  Roman  Decl.,  Exhs.  4-20)  (media  reports  regarding  evidence \ncontradicting  gang  allegations).  Such  false  accusations  are  particularly  devastating  given \n8 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 9 of 28\nPetitioner’s strong claims for relief under our immigration laws. See Exh. B (Babaie Decl.) ¶¶ 3-\n4.  \nThe government’s errors are unsurprising, given the methods it is employing to identify \nmembers of TdA. The “Alien Enemy Validation Guide” that the government has used to ascertain \nalien enemy status, requires ICE officers to tally points for different categories of alleged TdA \nmembership characteristics. J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, ECF No. 67-21 (Sarabia Roman Decl., \nExh. 1). The guide relies on a number of dubious criteria, including physical attributes like “tattoos \ndenoting membership/loyalty to TDA” and hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti, or manner of \ndress. But experts who study the TdA have explained how none of these physical attributes are \nreliable ways of identifying gang members.

See J.G.G., \n145 S. Ct. at 1010–11 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (“inmates in Salvadoran prisons are highly likely \nto face immediate and intentional life-threatening harm at the hands of state actors (internal \nquotation marks omitted)); see also J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, ECF No. 44-4 (Bishop Decl.) \n¶¶ 21, 33, 37, 39, 41; id. at 44-3 (Goebertus Decl.) ¶¶ 8, 10, 17.

Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); see Misquitta v. Warden Pine Prairie ICE Processing Ctr., \n \n4 https://perma.cc/52PT-DWMR. \n10 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 11 of 28\n353 F. Supp. 3d 518, 521 (W.D. La. 2018) (citing Piedmont Heights Civic Club, Inc. v. Moreland, \n637 F.2d 430 (5th Cir. 1981)). In cases against the government, the third and fourth factors merge. \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 187 n.204 (5th Cir. 2015) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 435 (2009)). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Petitioner Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n \nA.  The Proclamation Does Not Satisfy the AEA. \n \nThe Proclamation is unprecedented, exceeding the President’s statutory authority in three \ncritical respects: there is no invasion or predatory incursion; no foreign government or nation; and \nno process to contest whether an individual falls within the Proclamation. When the government \nasserts “an unheralded power” in a “long-extant statute,” courts “greet its announcement with a \nmeasure of skepticism.” Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014).  \nThat skepticism is well warranted here. As Judge Henderson of the D.C. Circuit stressed \nin denying the government’s request for a stay of a TRO, a gang’s criminal activities do not \nconstitute an “invasion or predatory incursion” under the AEA and the Act is a wartime authority \nmeant to address “military” attacks. J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5067, 2025 WL 914682, at *1-13 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 26, 2025). And in granting a permanent injunction against removals out of the \nSouthern District of Texas, Judge Rodriguez recently held that “the Proclamation’s language \ncannot be read as describing conduct that falls within the meaning of ‘invasion’” or “predatory \nincursion” within the AEA. J.A.V., 2025 WL 1257450, at *18. Moreover, Judge Hellerstein of the \nSouthern District of New York and Judge Sweeney of the District of Colorado have both also \nentered preliminary injunctions against transfers and removals based on the Proclamation’s failure \nto meet the necessary predicates of the AEA. See G.F.F., 2025 WL 1301052, at *1 (“since \n11 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 12 of 28\nRespondents have not demonstrated the existence of a “war,” “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” \nthe AEA was not validly invoked by the Presidential Proclamation”); D.B.U., 2025 WL 1304288, \nat *7 (“Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the President’s invocation \nof the Act ‘through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute’ and is therefore unlawful”). \n1.  There Is No “Invasion” or “Predatory Incursion” upon the United States. \n \nThe Proclamation fails, on its face, to satisfy an essential statutory requirement: that there \nbe an “invasion or predatory incursion” directed “against the territory of the United States.” The \ntext and history of the AEA make clear that it uses these terms to refer to military actions indicative \nof an actual or impending war. At the time of enactment, an “invasion” was a large-scale military \naction by an army intent on territorial conquest. See Webster’s Dict., Invasion (1828) (“invasion” \nis a “hostile entrance into the possession of another; particularly, the entrance of a hostile army \ninto a country for purpose of conquest or plunder, or the attack of a military force”); see also, e.g., \nJ.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *20 (in the Constitution, “invasion” “is used in a military sense” “in \nevery instance”); J.A.V., 2025 WL 1257450, at *16 (“the plain, ordinary meaning of ‘invasion’ \nwas an entry into the nation’s territory by a military force or an organized, armed force, with the \npurpose of conquering or obtaining control over territory”); D.B.U., 2025 WL 1304288, at *6 (“the \nword ‘invasion’ as used in the Act ‘contemplate[s] military action’” (citation omitted)). And \n“predatory incursion” referred to smaller-scale military raids aimed to destroy military structures \nor supplies, or to otherwise sabotage the enemy, often as a precursor to invasion and war. See \nWebster’s Dict., Incursion (1828) (“incursion . . . applies to the expeditions of small parties or \ndetachments of an enemy’s army, entering a territory for attack, plunder, or destruction of a post \nor magazine”); J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *10 (“predatory incursion” is “a form of hostilities \nagainst the United States by another nation-state, a form of attack short of war”); J.A.V., 2025 WL \n12 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 13 of 28\n1257450, at *16 (“the common usage of ‘predatory incursion’ . . . referenced a military force or \nan organized, armed force entering a territory to destroy property, plunder, and harm individuals, \nwith a subsequent retreat from that territory”); D.B.U., 2025 WL 1304288, at *6 (same); G.F.F., \n2025 WL 1301052, at *10 (“‘incursion’ was understood to mean an ‘[a]ttack’ or ‘[i]nvasion \nwithout conquest’”). The interpretive canon of noscitur a sociis confirms that the AEA’s powers \nextended beyond an existing war only when war was imminent. Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 169 n.13 \n(“the life of [the AEA] is defined by the existence of a war”). Reading “invasion” and “predatory \nincursion” in light of the neighboring term, “declared war,” highlights the express military nature \nof their usage here. See Jarecki v. G.D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307 (1961). \nThe historical context in which the AEA was passed reinforces what Congress meant by \n“predatory incursion” and “invasion.” At the time of passage, French ships were already attacking \nU.S. merchant ships in U.S. See, e.g., 7 Annals of Cong. 58 (May 1797) (promoting creation of a \nNavy to “diminish the probability of . . . predatory incursions” by French ships while recognizing \nthat distance from Europe lessened the chance of “invasion”); Act of July 9, 1798, ch. 68, 1 Stat. \n578, 578 (authorizing US ships to seize “any armed French vessel” “found within the jurisdictional \nlimits of the United States”). Congress worried that these attacks against the territory of U.S. were \nthe precursor to all-out war with France. J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *1 (“In 1798, our fledgling \nRepublic was consumed with fear . . . of external war with France.”). This “predatory violence” \nby a sovereign nation led, in part, to the AEA. See Act of July 7, 1798, ch. 67, 1 Stat. 578, 578 \n(“[W]hereas, under authority of the French government, there is yet pursued against the United \nStates, a system of predatory violence”).5 \n \n5 At the same time, the 1798 Congress authorized the President to raise troops “in the event of a \ndeclaration of war against the U.S., or of an actual invasion of their territory, by a foreign power, \n \n13 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 14 of 28\n“Mass illegal migration” or criminal activities, as described in the Proclamation, plainly do \nnot fall within the statutory boundaries. See J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *10 (observing that \n“[m]igration alone [does] not suffice” to establish an “invasion” or “predatory incursion under the \nAEA). On its face, the Proclamation makes no findings that TdA is acting as an army or military \nforce. Nor does the Proclamation assert that TdA is acting with an intent to gain a territorial \nfoothold in the U.S. for military purposes. And the Proclamation makes no suggestion that the U.S. \nwill imminently be at war with Venezuela. The oblique references to the TdA’s ongoing “irregular \nwarfare” within the U.S. do not suffice because the Proclamation makes clear that that term is \nreferring to “mass illegal migration” and “crimes”—neither of which constitute war within the \nFounding Era understanding. It asserts that TdA “commits brutal crimes” with the goal of \n“harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and . . . destabilizing democratic \nnations.” But these actions are not “against the territory” of the U.S. See G.F.F., 2025 WL 1301052, \nat *10 (“There is nothing in the AEA that justifies a finding that refugees migrating from \nVenezuela, or TdA gangsters who infiltrate the migrants, are engaged in an ‘invasion’ or ‘predatory \nincursion.’”). Indeed, if mass migration or criminal activities by some members of a particular \nnationality could qualify as an “invasion,” then virtually any group, hailing from any country, \ncould be deemed enemy aliens. \n2.  The Purported Invasion Is Not by a “Foreign Nation or Government.” \n \nThe Proclamation also fails to assert that any “foreign nation or government” within the \nmeaning of the Act is invading the United States. Put simply, the Proclamation never finds that \n \nor of imminent danger of such invasion.” Act of May 28, 1798, ch. 47, 1 Stat. 558. As Judge \nHenderson noted, “[t]his language bears more than a passing resemblance to the language of the \nAEA, which Congress enacted a mere thirty-nine days later. J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *9. As \nsuch, the historical context makes plain that Congress was concerned about military incursions by \nthe armed forces of a foreign nation that constitute or imminently precede acts of war. \n14 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 15 of 28\nTdA is a foreign “nation” or “government.” Instead, the Proclamation asserts that “[o]ver the years,” \nthe Venezuelan government has “ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational \ncriminal organizations.” But the Proclamation notably does not say that TdA operates as a \ngovernment in those regions. In fact, the Proclamation does not even specify that TdA currently \ncontrols any territory in Venezuela. \nMoreover, when a “nation or government” is designated under the AEA, the statute unlocks \npower over that nation or government’s “natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects.” 50 U.S.C. § 21. \nCountries have “natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects.” By contrast, criminal organizations, in \nthe Proclamation’s own words, have “members.” Proclamation § 1 (“members of TdA”). And it \ndesignates TdA “members” as subject to AEA enforcement—but “members” are not “natives, \ncitizens,  denizens,  or  subjects.”  That  glaring  mismatch  underscores  that  Respondents  are \nattempting not only to use the AEA in an unprecedented way, but also in a way that Congress \nnever permitted—as a mechanism to address, in the government’s own words, a non-state actor. \nVenezuela has natives, citizens, and subjects, but TdA (not Venezuela) is designated under the \nProclamation.6 Even as the Proclamation singles out certain Venezuelan nationals, it does not \nclaim that Venezuela is invading the United States. And, as the President’s own CIA Director \nrecently testified, the intelligence community has no assessment that says the U.S. is at war with \nor being invaded by Venezuela. Ryan Goodman, Bluesky (Mar. 26, 2025).7 The AEA requires the \n \n6 Moreover, the AEA presumes that a designated nation possesses treaty-making powers. See 50 \nU.S.C. § 22 (“stipulated by any treaty . . . between the United States and the hostile nation or \ngovernment”). Nations—not criminal organizations—are the entities that enter into treaties. See, \ne.g., Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 505, 508 (2008) (treaty is “a compact between independent \nnations” and “agreement among sovereign powers”); Holmes v. Jennison, 39 U.S. 540, 570-72 \n(1840) (similar).  \n7 https://bsky.app/profile/rgoodlaw.bsky.social/post/3llc4wzbkr22k  (Q:  “Does  the  intelligence \ncommunity assess that we are currently at war or being invaded by the nation of Venezuela?” A: \n“We have no assessment that says that.”). \n15 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 16 of 28\nPresident to identify a “foreign nation or government” that is invading or engaging in an invasion \nor incursion. Because it does not, the Proclamation fails on its face. See D.B.U., 2025 WL 1304288, \nat *7 (“Respondents acknowledge TdA is a ‘nonstate actor’ and that TdA ‘itself is [not] itself a \n‘nation.’ This acknowledgment starts and stops the Court’s discussion of what ‘foreign nation’ or \n‘government’ mean under the Act.”) (cleaned up). \nFurther, the AEA’s historical record confirms that it was intended to address conflicts with \nforeign sovereigns, not criminal gangs like TdA. See 5 Annals of Cong. 1453 (Apr. 1798) (“[W]e \nmay very shortly be involved in war[.]”); John Lord O’Brian, Special Ass’t to the Att’y Gen. for \nWar Work, Civil Liberty in War Time, at 8 (Jan. 17, 1919) (“The [AEA] was passed by \nCongress . . . at a time when it was supposed that war with France was imminent.”); Jennifer K. \nElsea & Matthew C. Weed, Cong. Rsch. Serv., RL3113, Declarations of War and Authorizations \nfor the Use of Military Force 1 (2014) (Congress has never issued a declaration of war against a \nnonstate actor). If Respondents were allowed to designate any group with ties to officials as a \nforeign government, and courts were powerless to review that designation, any group could be \ndeemed a government, leading to an untenable and overbroad application of the AEA. \nThe Proclamation half-heartedly attempts to link TdA to Venezuela by suggesting only that \nTdA  is  “supporting,”  “closely  aligned  with,”  or  “has  infiltrated”  the  Maduro  regime.  See \nProclamation. But those characterizations, even if accepted, are insufficient to establish that a \n“foreign government or nation” is itself invading the United States. Thus, this court need not go \nbeyond the face of the Proclamation to find that it fails to satisfy the statutory preconditions of the \nAEA. In any event, experts are in accord that it is “absolutely implausible that the Maduro regime \ncontrols TdA or that the Maduro government and TdA are intertwined.” J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-\nJEB, ECF No. 67-3 (Hanson Decl.) ¶17; id. at 67-4 (Antillano Decl.) ¶ 13; id. at 67-12 (Dudley \n16 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 17 of 28\nDecl.) ¶¶ 2, 21. As one expert who has done numerous projects for the U.S. government, including \non the topic of TdA, explained, the Proclamation’s characterization of the relationship between the \nVenezuelan state and TdA with respect to TdA’s activities in the United States is “simply incorrect.” \nId. at 67-12 (Dudley Decl.) ¶¶ 5, 17-18. The President’s own intelligence agencies reached that \nsame conclusion prior to his invocation of the AEA. See id. at 67-21 (Sarabia Roman Decl., Exh. \n19) (“shared judgment of the nation’s spy agencies” is “that [TdA] was not controlled by the \nVenezuelan government”); see also National Intelligence Council, Sense of the Community \nMemorandum, SOCM 2025-11374, Venezuela: Examining Regime Ties to Tren de Aragua (Apr. \n7, 2025).8 \nB.  Summary Removals Without Notice, a Meaningful Opportunity to Challenge \n“Alien Enemy” Designations, or the Right of Voluntary Departure Violate \nthe AEA and Due Process. \n \nAs the Supreme Court has now made clear, the government must provide Petitioner and \nthe putative class with notice “within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them \nto actually seek” relief from summary removals under the Proclamation. J.G.G., 2025 WL 102409, \nat *2 (“detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity \nto challenge their removal.”).  \nDespite these clear instructions, it has been revealed that the government has adopted a \nwholly inadequate notice process. It has created an English-only “notice” of “alien enemy” \ndesignation, which does not indicate there is a right to challenge the designation or even consult \nwith an attorney. Exh. A (Cisneros Decl.) at 5. The government maintains this document need only \nbe given 12 hours before removal to satisfy the Supreme Court’s command for due process and \n“reasonable time.” The government believes it may proceed with removal after 12 hours, unless a \n \n8 https://perma.cc/PU5K-78LH. \n17 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 18 of 28\nperson “indicate[s] or express[es] an intent to file a habeas petition.” Id. ¶ 11. If a person who \nindicates such an intent “does not file such a petition within 24 hours, then ICE may proceed with \nthe removal.” Id. Furthermore, even when a person does file such a petition, the government still \ndoes not agree to wait for those proceedings to conclude before removal absent a TRO from the \nreviewing court. Id. ¶ 12 (“Although there may be fact-specific exceptional cases, in a general case, \nICE will not remove under the AEA an alien who has filed a habeas petition while that petition is \npending. However, ICE may reconsider that position in cases where a TRO has been denied and \nthe habeas proceedings have not concluded within a reasonable time.”). \n“‘It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles [noncitizens] to due process of \nlaw’ in the context of removal proceedings.” J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1006; see also G.F.F., 2025 WL \n1301052, at *7. This notice process appears designed to deprive designated individuals of a \nmeaningful opportunity to challenge their designations. The timeframe alone makes it effectively \nimpossible to challenge an AEA designation without an attorney given the constraints on accessing \nthe courts from detention. And the government will only pause removal plans if a designated \nindividual says they would like to file “habeas,” an esoteric legal proceeding that is not mentioned \nby name anywhere on the notice. For represented individuals, including Petitioner, there is \napparently no requirement that such notice be served on counsel. \nAt a minimum, the notice must be translated into a language that individuals can understand \n(for Petitioner, Spanish). Most importantly, there must be sufficient time for individuals to seek \njudicial review, if they choose, as well as the factual bases for the allegations. G.F.F., 2025 WL \n1301052, at *7 (citing Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)); \nsee also Sanchez Puentes, 2025 WL 1203179, *17. As during World War II, that notice must be \n18 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 19 of 28\nat least 30 days in advance of any attempted removal. And it must be provided to undersigned \ncounsel so that no individual is mistakenly removed. See, e.g., Abrego Garcia, 145 S. Ct. at 1018. \nC.  The Proclamation Violates the Specific Protections that Congress Established \nfor Noncitizens Seeking Humanitarian Protection. \n \nThe Proclamation is unlawful for an independent reason: it overrides statutory protections \nfor noncitizens seeking relief from torture by subjecting them to removal without meaningful \nconsideration of their claims. Congress codified the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”) to ensure that noncitizens have \nmeaningful opportunities to seek protection from torture. See 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note; C.F.R. §§ \n208.16-.18. CAT categorically prohibits returning a noncitizen to any country where they would \nmore likely than not face torture. 8 U.S.C. §1231 note. CAT applies regardless of the mechanism \nfor removal. The D.C. Circuit recently addressed a similar issue in Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, \nreconciling the Executive’s authority under a public-health statute, 42 U.S.C. § 265, with CAT’s \nprotections. 27 F.4th 718 (D.C. Cir. 2022). Because § 265 was silent about where noncitizens could \nbe expelled, and CAT explicitly addressed that question, the court held no conflict existed. Id. \nBoth statutes could—and therefore must—be given effect. Id. at 721, 731-32. This case is on all \nfours with Huisha-Huisha, because the AEA and CAT must be harmonized by applying CAT’s \nprotections to AEA removals. Despite this clear statutory framework, the Proclamation overrides \nall of the INA’s protections and deprives those designated under the Proclamation with any \nopportunity to seek protection against being sent to a place where they will be tortured. See J.G.G., \n2025 WL 890401, at *15 (“CAT could stand as an independent obstacle” to “potential torture \nshould Plaintiffs be removed to El Salvador and incarcerated there.”) \nThe AEA can similarly be harmonized with other subsequently enacted statutes specifically \ndesigned to protect noncitizens seeking asylum and withholding. See Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. \n19 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 20 of 28\nL. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (1980) (asylum and withholding); 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158 (asylum), \n1231(b)(3) (withholding of removal). Congress has unequivocally declared that “[a]ny alien who \nis physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States . . . irrespective of \nsuch alien’s status, may apply for asylum.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). Likewise, the withholding of \nremoval statute explicitly bars returning a noncitizen to a country where their “life or freedom” \nwould be threatened based on a protected ground. Id. § 1231(b)(3)(A). These humanitarian \nprotections were enacted in the aftermath of World War II, when the United States joined other \ncountries in committing to never again turn our backs on people fleeing persecution and torture. \nSadako Ogata, U.N. High Comm’r for Refugees, Address at the Holocaust Memorial Museum \n(Apr. 30, 1997).9 A President invoking the AEA cannot simply sweep away these protections. \nD.  The Proclamation Violates the Procedural Requirements of the INA \n \nSince the last invocation of the AEA more than 80 years ago, Congress has carefully \nspecified the procedures by which noncitizens may be removed. The INA leaves little doubt that \nits procedures must apply to every removal, unless otherwise specified by that statute. It directs: \n“Unless otherwise specified in this chapter,” the INA’s comprehensive scheme provides “the sole \nand exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be . . . removed from the United \nStates.” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3); see also United States v. Tinoso, 327 F.3d 864, 867 (9th Cir. 2003) \n(“Deportation and removal must be achieved through the procedures provided in the INA.”). \nIndeed, Congress intended for the INA to “supersede all previous laws with regard to deportability.” \nS. Rep. No. 82-1137, at 30 (Jan. 29, 1952).10 \n \n9 https://perma.cc/X5YF-K6EU. \n10 One of the processes otherwise specified in the INA is the Alien Terrorist Removal Procedure \nat 8 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq. The Attorney General may opt to use this when she has classified \ninformation that a noncitizen is an “alien terrorist.” Id. § 1533(a)(1). But even that process requires \n \n20 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 21 of 28\nCongress was aware that alien enemies were subject to removal in times of war or invasion \nwhen it enacted the INA. See Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 32 (1990) (courts presume \nCongress drafts statutes with full knowledge of existing law). Indeed, the AEA was invoked just a \nfew years before passage of the 1952 INA. With this awareness, Congress provided that the INA \ncontains the “sole and exclusive” procedures for removal and declined to carve out AEA removals \nfrom standard immigration procedures, even as it expressly excepted other groups of noncitizens, \nincluding those who pose security risks. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq. (establishing fast-track \nproceedings for noncitizens posing national security risks). By ignoring the INA’s role as the “sole \nand exclusive” procedure for determining whether a noncitizen may be removed, the Proclamation \nunlawfully bypasses the mandated congressional scheme and usurps Congress’s Article I power \nin the process. \nII.  Petitioner and the Class Face Imminent Irreparable Harm. \n \nIn the absence of a TRO, Petitioner and the putative class—who are detained and are \nalleged, incorrectly, to be associated with TdA—are at imminent risk of summary removal to \nplaces, such as El Salvador, where they face life-threatening conditions, persecution, and torture. \nSee supra; see also J.G.G., 2025 WL 1024097, at *5 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (“[I]nmates in \nSalvadoran prisons are ‘highly likely to face immediate and intentional life-threatening harm at \nthe hands of state actors.’”); D.B.U. v. Trump, No. 1:25-CV-01163-CNS, 2025 WL 1163530, at \n*13 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025) (“Absent a TRO, Petitioner faces the risk of being deported—perhaps \nwrongfully deported—under the Act and Proclamation in violation of their constitutional rights.”). \nThat easily constitutes irreparable harm. See Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 169, 178 (5th Cir. \n \nnotice, a public hearing, provision of counsel for indigents, opportunity to present evidence, and \nindividualized review by an Article III judge. Id. §§ 1532(a), 1534(a)(2), (b), (c)(1)-(2).  \n21 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 22 of 28\n2005) (irreparable harm” where petitioners face “forced separation and likely persecution” “if \ndeported”); Duran-Ortega v. U.S. Att’y Gen., No. 18-14563-D, (11th Cir. Nov. 29, 2018) (Martin, \nJ., concurring) (irreparable harm where petitioner would likely “be physically harmed if . . . \nremoved  to  El  Salvador”);  Huisha-Huisha,  27  F.4th  at  733  (irreparable  harm  exists  where \npetitioners “expelled to places where they will be persecuted or tortured”); see also J.G.G., 2025 \nWL 890401, at *16 (“[T]he risk of torture, beatings, and even death clearly and unequivocally \nsupports a finding of irreparable harm” if Venezuelans are removed under the AEA Proclamation \nto El Salvador); G.F.F., 2025 WL 1301052, at *11 (“[A]bsent a preliminary injunction, Petitioners \nwould be removed from the United States to CECOT, where they would endure abuse and \ninhumane treatment with no recourse to bring them back. If that is not irreparable harm, what is?”).  \nAnd Petitioner and putative class members may never get out of these prisons, particularly \nconsidering the government’s position that once it sends a person to CECOT, even though \ndetention there continues at the government’s request, the government is powerless to secure their \nrelease and return. See J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1101 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (noting government’s \nposition that “even when it makes a mistake, it cannot retrieve individuals from the Salvadoran \nprisons to which it has sent them”); Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25-1404, 2025 WL 1135112, at \n*2 (4th Cir. Apr. 17, 2025) (“both the United States and the El Salvadoran governments disclaim \nany authority and/or responsibility to return” unlawfully removed noncitizen); Arguelles v. U.S. \nAtt’y Gen., 661 F. App’x 694, 716 (11th Cir. Nov. 23, 2016) (“[I]n Nken, the Supreme Court told \nus removal from the United States [after entry of a removal order] is not categorically irreparable \nbecause removed petitioners ‘who prevail [in a petition for review] can be afforded effective relief \nby facilitation of their return.’ 556 U.S. 418, 435. But . . . it is implicit in this rule that removal \n22 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 23 of 28\ndoes constitute irreparable harm when facilitation of a removed petitioner’s return will not be \npossible.” (emphasis in original)). \nEven if the government instead removes Petitioner or putative class members to Venezuela, \nthey face serious harm there, too. For instance, M.A.P.S. fled Venezuela for the very purpose of \nescaping persecution there and has a pending asylum case on that basis. Exh. B (Babaie Decl.) ¶¶ \n3-4. Specifically, M.A.P.S. was intimidated and attacked for her political opposition to the \ngovernment, including by police, and she fears persecution or torture on the basis of her political \nopinion. Id. ¶ 3. And returning to Venezuela labeled as a gang member by the U.S. government \nonly increases the danger, as she will face heightened scrutiny from Venezuela’s security agency, \nand possibly even violence from rivals of TdA. J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, ECF No. 67-3 \n(Hanson Decl.) ¶ 28. \nNot only do Petitioner and the putative class face grave harm, thus far the government has \ntried to execute removals without any due process. See Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 560 F. Supp. \n3d 146, 172 (D.D.C. 2021) (irreparable harm where plaintiffs “face the threat of removal prior to \nreceiving any of the protections the immigration laws provide”), aff’d in part and rev’d in part, 27 \nF.4th 718 (D.C Cir. 2022). Although the Supreme Court has now made clear that meaningful notice \nis required under the AEA, J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1006, Respondents take the position that they may \nprovide English-only, plainly inadequate notice on a Friday night and execute removal—without \na removal order—within 12 hours unless a designated individual has counsel available to file a \nhabeas petition while the Court is closed. See Exh. A (Cisneros Decl.)  ¶¶ 11-12. As such, there \nremains an unacceptably high risk that the government will deport individuals who are not in fact \nmembers of TdA, including Petitioner and putative class members. See G.F.F., 2025 WL 1301052, \n23 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 24 of 28\nat *7 (“the risk of erroneous deprivation of an alien’s liberty interest, without a ‘full examination \nand hearing’ . . . as required by the AEA, is great.”). \nIII.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Weigh Decidedly in Favor of a \nTemporary Restraining Order.  \n \nThe balance of equities and public interest merge in cases against the government. See \nNken, 556 U.S. at 436. Here, the balance overwhelmingly favors Petitioner and the putative class. \nThe public has a critical interest in preventing wrongful removals, especially where it could mean \na lifetime sentence in a notorious foreign prison. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 436; see also Mississippi \nWomen’s Med. Clinic v. McMillan, 866 F.2d 788, 795 (5th Cir. 1989) (“[A]ny denial of the [legal] \nright . . . would be an irreparable harm.”); Nunez v. Boldin, 537 F. Supp. 578, 587 (S.D. Tex. 1982) \n(protecting people who face persecution abroad “goes to the very heart of the principles and moral \nprecepts upon which this country and its Constitution were founded”). That is especially so given \nthe government’s position that it will not obtain the release of individuals mistakenly sent to the \nnotorious Salvadoran prison. Supra. \nPetitioner and the putative class do not contest Respondents’ ability to prosecute criminal \noffenses, detain noncitizens, and remove noncitizens under the immigration laws. Cf. J.G.G., 2025 \nWL 914682, at *30 (Henderson, J., concurring) (“The Executive remains free to take TdA \nmembers off the streets and keep them in detention[, and] can also deport alleged members of TdA \nunder the INA[.]”); G.F.F., 2025 WL 1301052, at *12 (“[N]othing in this Order shall be construed \nto bar the removal, or release from immigration detention, of Petitioners pursuant to proceedings \nheld under the Immigration and Nationality Act.”). Thus, Respondents cannot show how the \ngovernment’s interests overcome irreparable injury to Petitioner and the putative class.  \n24 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 25 of 28\nIV.  The All Writs Act Confers Broad Power to Preserve the Integrity of Court \nProceedings. \n \nIn addition to this Court’s equitable powers, this is a textbook case for use of the All Writs \nAct (“AWA”), which provides courts a powerful tool to “maintain the status quo by injunction \npending review of an agency’s action through the prescribed statutory channels.” F.T.C. v. Dean \nFoods Co., 384 U.S. 597, 604 (1966); 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a); Adams v. U.S. ex rel. McCann, 317 \nU.S. 269, 273 (1942) (“a federal court may avail itself of all auxiliary writs as aids in the \nperformance of its duties. . . to achieve the ends of justice entrusted to it”); J.A.V. v. Trump, No. \n1:25-CV-072, 2025 WL 1064009, at *1 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 2025) (“A federal court has the power \nunder the All Writs Act to issue injunctive orders in a case even before the court’s jurisdiction has \nbeen established.”). If Petitioner and members of the putative class are illegally sent to a foreign \ncountry, and El Salvador assumes jurisdiction, the government will argue, as it already has, that \nthis Court will no longer have jurisdiction to remedy the unlawful use of the AEA. See Resp. to \nOrder to Show Cause, J.G.G., No. 25-cv-766-JEB (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 2025), ECF No. 58 at 12 \n(government asserting “once the flights were outside the United States, the President did not need \nto rely on that Proclamation or Act to justify transferring members of a designated foreign terrorist \ngroup to a foreign country”); Resp. to Plfs.’ Mot. for Additional Relief, Abrego Garcia v. Noem, \nNo. 8:25-cv-951-PX (D. Md. Apr. 13, 2025), ECF No. 65 at 3-4 (government arguing that “[t]he \nfederal courts have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to . . . engage with a foreign \nsovereign in a given manner,” to facilitate return of wrongfully deported individual). \nWhereas a traditional TRO requires a party to state a claim, an injunction based on the \nAWA requires only that a party identify a threat to the integrity of an ongoing or prospective \nproceeding, or of a past order or judgment. See ITT Cmty. Dev. Corp. v. Barton, 569 F.2d 1351, \n1359 (5th Cir. 1978) (court may enjoin “conduct which, left unchecked, would have . . . the \n25 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171     Document 3-1     Filed 05/10/25     Page 26 of 28\npractical effect of diminishing the court’s power to bring the litigation to a natural conclusion”); \nIn Re: Nat’l Football League Players Concussion Injury Litigation, 923 F.3d 96, 109 (3d Cir. \n2019) (“[U]nder the All Writs Act, action is authorized to the extent it is ‘necessary or appropriate’ \nto enforce a Court’s prior orders. . . Or, as this Court has explained it, there is authority under the \nAct to issue an injunction where such relief is ‘necessary, or perhaps merely helpful.’”) (citing 28 \nU.S.C. § 1651 and Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co. v. United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO, 633 \nF.2d 302, 307 (3d Cir. 1980)). Courts have explicitly relied upon the AWA in order to prevent \neven a risk that a respondent’s actions will diminish the court’s capacity to adjudicate claims before \nit. See Michael v. INS, 48 F.3d 657, 664 (2d Cir. 1995) (staying an order of deportation “in order \nto safeguard the court’s appellate jurisdiction” and preserve its ability to hear subsequent appeals \nby the petitioner). Thus, multiple courts across the country have issued TROs in this context where \npetitioners faced the imminent risk of transfer and removal under the AEA, even when they had \nnot yet received a designation notice. See, e.g., D.B.U., 2025 WL 1163530, at *4; A.S.R. v. Trump, \nNo. 3:25-CV-00113-SLH, 2025 WL 1122485, at *1 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 15, 2025); Order, Y.A.P.A. v. \nTrump, No. 4:25-cv-144-CDL-CHW (M.D. Ga.

The Fifth Circuit has approved the \nexercise of this discretion to require no security in cases brought by indigent people and/or public-\ninterest litigation. See, e.g., City of Atlanta v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 636 F.2d 1084, \n1094 (5th Cir. 1981); Steward v. West, 449 F.2d 324, 325 (5th Cir. 1971).

Section \n1101, et seq. The Court will therefore use these terms interchangeably.  \n3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 4 of 56\n     \n \nBACKGROUND  \n    This case arises out of the President’s unprecedented peacetime invocation of a \nwartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act4 (“AEA”). See Act of July 6, 1798, ch. 66, 1 Stat. \n577.  These novel issues stand at the intersection of a stand-alone removal power, the AEA, and \nthe  later-enacted  comprehensive  immigration  system,  the  Immigration  and  Nationality Act \n(“INA”).  It is therefore critical for this Court to recount the history of the AEA, Proclamation \n10903, and Petitioner’s individual case.  \nA.  Brief History of the AEA   \n  Title 50 of the United States Code contains provisions regarding war and national defense. \nSee 50 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.  Chapter 3 specifically covers “Alien Enemies”. Id. at § 21.  “Enacted in \n1798 by a Congress consumed with fear of war with France, the Alien Enemies Act provided a \nwartime counterpart to the widely denounced Alien Friends Act, which granted the President \nsweeping power to detain and expel any noncitizen he deemed ‘dangerous to the peace and safety \nof the United States.’” See J.G.G. v. Trump, 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1007–08 (2025) (Sotomayor, J. \ndissenting) (citing the Act of June 25, 1798, 1 Stat. 571).  “Unlike the Alien Friends Act, which \nlapsed in disrepute . . . the Founders saw the Alien Enemies Act as a constitutional exercise of \nCongress’s powers to ‘declare War,’ to ‘raise and support Armies,’ and to ‘provide for calling forth \nthe Militia to . . . suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.’” Id. (citing U. S. CONST., art. I, § 8, \n \n4 For clarity, when this Court refers to the AEA, it is referring to the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. \n§ 21, as enacted in 1798.  Conversely, when the Court refers to Proclamation 10903, it is referring \nto the executive order issued by President Trump on March 14, 2025, which invoked the AEA.  \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 5 of 56\n     \n \ncls. 11–15.1 and Letter from J. Madison to T. Jefferson (May 20, 1798), in 30 Papers of Thomas \nJefferson 358 (B. Oberg ed. 2003)).   \nThe AEA is a wartime authority that grants the President of the United States specific \npowers with respect to the regulation, detention, and removal of alien enemies.  As codified today, \nthe AEA provides: \n[w]henever there is a declared war between the United States and \nany foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory \nincursion  is  perpetrated,  attempted,  or  threatened  against  the \nterritory of the United States by any foreign nation or government, \nand  the  president  makes  public  proclamation  of  the  event,  all \nnatives,  citizens,  denizens,  or  subjects  of  the  hostile  nation  or \ngovernment, being the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall \nbe within the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be \nliable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien \nenemies. The President is authorized in any such event, by his \nproclamation thereof, or other public act, to direct the conduct to be \nobserved on the part of the United States, toward the aliens who \nbecome so liable; the manner and degree of the restraint to which \nthey shall be subject and in what cases, and upon what security their \nresidence shall be permitted, and to provide for the removal of those \nwho, not being permitted to reside within the United States, refuse \nor neglect to depart therefrom; and to establish any other regulations \nwhich are found necessary in the premises and for the public safety. \n50 U.S.C. § 21.   \nTitle 50 Section 22 also provides a section for an alien enemy’s voluntary departure when \nthere are bilateral international agreements or treaties. Titled “Time allowed to settle affairs and \ndepart,” Section 22 reads: \nWhen an alien who becomes liable as an enemy, in the manner \nprescribed in section 21 of this title, is not chargeable with actual \nhostility,  or  other  crime  against  the  public  safety,  he  shall  be \nallowed, for the recovery, disposal, and removal of his goods and \neffects, and for his departure, the full time which is or shall be \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 6 of 56\n     \n \nstipulated by any treaty then in force between the United States and \nthe hostile nation or government of which he is a native citizen, \ndenizen, or subject; and where no such treaty exists, or is in force, \nthe President may ascertain and declare such reasonable time as may \nbe consistent with the public safety, and according to the dictates of \nhumanity and national hospitality. \n50 U.S.C. § 22.  \nPrior to the invocation of Proclamation 10903, U. S. Presidents have invoked the AEA only \nthree times, each in the context of an ongoing war: the War of 1812, World War I, and World War \nII.  During the War of 1812, President James Madison issued a proclamation that required subjects \nof Great Britain and Ireland “to report themselves to the marshal of the state in which such aliens \nresided.5”  In 1917, over a century later, the United States declared war against Germany in World \nWar I.  Then-President Woodrow Wilson invoked the AEA at that time to curtail the ability of \nGerman aliens to own weapons and travel freely and provided for their possible confinement6. See \n40 Stat. 1651, 1716, 1730, 1772.  Lastly, just one day after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, then-\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt made a “public proclamation . . . that an invasion has been \nperpetrated upon the territory of the United States by the Empire of Japan7.” 6 Fed. Reg. 6321. \nThe next day, President Roosevelt further proclaimed, “that an invasion or predatory incursion is \nthreatened upon the territory of the United States by Germany8.” See also 6 Fed. Reg. 6324 \n \n5 Lockington v. Smith, 15 F.Cas. 758, 758–759 (No. 8,448) (CC Pa. 1817) (discussing the War of \n1812 proclamation).  \n6 Declaring the Existence of a State of War with the German Empire and Setting Forth Regulations \nPrescribing Conduct Toward Alien Enemies, Proclamation No. 1364, 40 Stat. 1650 (World War I). \n7 Alien Enemies—Japanese, Proclamation No. 2525, 55 Stat. 1700 (World War II). \n8 Franklin D. Roosevelt, Proclamation 2526—Alien Enemies, German Online by Gerhard Peters \nand John T. Woolley, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY PROJECT, https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/no\nde/357751[https://perma.cc/6LAA-V8LT] (last accessed on June 9, 2025). \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 7 of 56\n     \n \n(reflecting a simultaneous proclamation9 as to Italy); 7 Fed. Reg. 5535 (expanding the declaration \nto aliens from Hungary, Romania10, and Bulgaria, after Congress declared war on those countries). \nB.  Proclamation 10903  \nUnlike the three prior invocations against sovereign nations during times of declared war, \non March 14, 2025, President Trump invoked the AEA alleging the Tren de Aragua11 criminal \norganization “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion \nagainst the territory of the United States.” Proclamation No. 10903 § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. 13033 (Mar. \n14, 2025).  Therein, President Trump, in relevant part, set forth the following:  \nTren  de  Aragua  (TdA)  is  a  designated  Foreign  Terrorist \nOrganization with thousands of members, many of whom have \nunlawfully  infiltrated  the  United  States  and  are  conducting \nirregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the \nUnited States.  \nTdA  operates  in  conjunction  with  Cártel  de  los  Soles,  the \nNicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise \nbased  in  Venezuela,  and  commits  brutal  crimes,  including \nmurders,  kidnappings,  extortions,  and  human,  drug,  and \nweapons  trafficking.  TdA  has  engaged  in  and  continues  to \nengage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further \nits objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining \npublic  safety,  and  supporting  the  Maduro  regime’s  goal  of \ndestabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the \nUnited States. \nTdA is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the \nMaduro regime, including its military and law enforcement \napparatus. \n \n9 https://archives.federalregister.gov/issue_slice/1941/12/10/6324-\n6326.pdf [https://perma.cc/3LD3-WFL4]. \n10 Romania is spelled “Rumania” in the proclamation. \n11 TdA is an entity that the United States Department of State has designated as a foreign terrorist \norganization. See 90 Fed. Reg. 10030 (2025). \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 8 of 56\n     \n \nMaduro leads the regime-sponsored enterprise Cártel de los \nSoles, which coordinates with and relies on TdA and other \norganizations to carry out its objective of using illegal narcotics \nas a weapon to “flood” the United States. \nVenezuelan  national  and  local  authorities  have  ceded  ever-\ngreater control over their territories to transnational criminal \norganizations, including TdA. The result is a hybrid criminal \nstate that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion \ninto the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to \nthe  United  States.  Indeed,  in  December  2024,  INTERPOL \nWashington  confirmed:  “Tren  de Aragua  has  emerged  as  a \nsignificant threat to the United States as it infiltrates migration \nflows from Venezuela.” Evidence irrefutably demonstrates that \nTdA has invaded the United States and continues to invade, \nattempt  to  invade,  and  threaten  to  invade  the  country; \nperpetrated irregular warfare within the country; and used drug \ntrafficking as a weapon against our citizens. \nTdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular \nwarfare against the territory of the United States both directly \nand at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro \nregime in Venezuela. \nId.   \nBased on these assertions, President Trump proclaimed “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years \nof age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually \nnaturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, \nrestrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.” Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13033 \n(Mar. 14, 2025).  President Trump further proclaimed, “all such members of TdA are, by virtue of \ntheir membership in that organization, chargeable with actual hostility against the United States \nand are therefore ineligible for the benefits of 50 [§] 22,” and “all such members of TdA are a \ndanger to the public peace or safety of the United States.” Id.  President Trump finally declared \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 9 of 56\n     \n \nthat all noncitizens within this group “are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and \nremoval, and . . . shall not be permitted residence in the United States.” Id.  \nOn March 14, 2025, the Attorney General of the United States issued a “Memorandum for \nLaw Enforcement Officers re: Guidance for Implementing the Alien Enemies Act (Mar. 14, \n2025),” advising law enforcement about the procedures to effectuate removal of noncitizens \nsubject to Proclamation 10903. See Ex. H12, Sarabia Roman Decl. 17, Pet’r’s Mem. of Law in \nSupp. of Mot., ECF No. 34-10 (“Limitations on Relief from Removal: An alien determined to be \nan Alien Enemy and ordered removed under the Proclamation and 50 U.S.C. § 21 is not entitled \nto a hearing before an immigration judge, to an appeal of the removal order to the Board of \nImmigration Appeals, or to judicial review of the removal order in any court of the United States.”).   \nOn April 7, 2025, the United States Supreme Court (“Supreme Court”) reversed the \nAttorney General when it issued its first decision involving Proclamation 10903 and made clear \njudicial review is appropriate. See J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1006.  The Supreme Court asserted that \n“although judicial review under the AEA is limited . . . an individual subject to detention and \nremoval under that statute is entitled to ‘judicial review’ as to ‘questions of interpretation and \nconstitutionality’ of the Act as well as whether he or she ‘is in fact an alien enemy fourteen years \nof age or older.’” Id. (citing Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U. S. 160, 163−164, 172, n. 17 (1948) (noting \nthat while not raised in the case, “[t]he additional question as to whether a person restrained is in \nfact an alien enemy fourteen years of age or older may also be reviewed by the courts.”).  The \n \n12 Exhibit H, as cited here, does not include a cover page within ECF No. 34. However, the Court \nimplies this is Exhibit H based on the description in the docket entry as well as Petitioner’s \nreference to this exhibit as such.  \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 10 of 56\n     \n \nCourt further made clear that “detainees are entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard \n‘appropriate to the nature of the case.’” Id. (internal citation omitted).  \nIn a subsequent opinion on Proclamation 10903, the Supreme Court advised that “[i]n order \nto ‘actually seek habeas relief,’ a detainee must have sufficient time and information to reasonably \nbe able to contact counsel, file a petition, and pursue appropriate relief.” A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 145 S. \nCt. 1364, 1368 (2025).  While the Court did not specify how much time or notice is due, the Court \nmade clear “notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise \ndue process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster.” Id.13  \nC.  Petitioner and the Certified Class  \n  Petitioner M.A.P.S. is a 33-year-old Venezuelan national who is detained pursuant to \nProclamation 10903 at the El Paso Processing Center in El Paso, Texas. Pet. 8, ECF No. 1.  \nPetitioner fled Venezuela after repeated harassment, assault, and intimidation on the basis of \npolitical persecution. Id.

See generally J.G.G.  “Although judicial \nreview under the AEA is limited, [the Supreme Court] ha[s] held that an individual subject to \ndetention and removal under that statute is entitled to ‘judicial review’ as to ‘questions of \ninterpretation and constitutionality’ of the Act as well as whether he or she ‘is in fact an alien \nenemy fourteen years of age or older.’” Id. at 1006 (citing Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 163, 172, n. 17).   \n  Moreover, this Court will review Petitioner’s claims under a summary judgment standard. \nSummary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any \nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED.

On May 29, 2025, this Court consolidated the preliminary injunction \nhearing with a trial on the merits. See Order Consol., ECF No. 37.  The Court hereby overrules \nRespondents’ objection,24 and because the parties have not raised any genuine issues of material \nfact25, the Court makes a final determination as to each issue as a matter of law. \nANALYSIS \n  In her Petition, Petitioner raises eight causes of action against Respondents alleging \nProclamation 10903 is unlawful.  First, Proclamation 10903 is an ultra vires violation of Title 50 \nof the United States Code Section 21, et seq., the AEA, because Proclamation 10903 does not \nsatisfy all statutory preconditions necessary for the AEA’s invocation.  Second, Proclamation \n10903 violates Title 8 of the United States Code Section 1101, et seq., because the AEA removal \nprocess creates an alternative removal mechanism outside of the INA’s “sole and exclusive” \nprocedure.  Third, Proclamation 10903 violates Title 8 of the United States Code Section 1158, \nAsylum, because the AEA removal process bars individuals from applying for asylum before \nremoval.  Fourth, Proclamation 10903 violates Title 8 of United States Code Section 1231(b)(3), \nWithholding of Removal, because it lacks safeguards to ensure individuals are not returned to a \ncountry where it is more likely than not that they would face persecution.  Fifth, Proclamation \n10903 violates Title 8 of the United States Code Section 1231, “Convention Against Torture” \n(“CAT”), because the AEA process lacks safeguards to ensure individuals are not returned to a \n \n24 See Resp’ts’ Notice of Obj., ECF No. 49 (“The administration has not implemented a new notice \npolicy on remand from A.A.R.P. v. Trump . . . and thus a final resolution of the case on the merits \nis premature.”). \n25 The parties dispute whether the assertions in Proclamation 10903 are true.  However, as stated \nbelow, this Court need not address these disputes to resolve all claims as a matter of law.  \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 16 of 56\n     \n \ncountry where it is more likely than not that they would face torture.  Sixth, Proclamation 10903 \nviolates Title 50 of the United States Code Section 22, the AEA, because Proclamation 10903 \ncategorically bars voluntary departure without individualized assessments.  Seventh, Proclamation \n10903  violates  the  Fifth Amendment’s  Due  Process  Clause  because  individuals  are  denied \nmeaningful protections to challenge their removal.  And eighth, Proclamation 10903 violates \nHabeas Corpus because Proclamation 10903 provides for summary removal.  This Court will \naddress each issue and related claims in turn. \nA.  Petitioner has standing.  \nAs a threshold matter, this Court must determine whether Petitioner has standing to bring \nthese claims against Respondents.  Standing “ensure[s] that federal courts do not exceed their \nauthority as it has been traditionally understood,” Spokeo Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016), \nand “is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III,” \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (internal citation omitted).  To establish \nstanding, “the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden” of establishing three elements: \n(1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability. Id.   \nAn ‘injury in fact’ [is] an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized” and “(b) ‘actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’” Id. (internal \ncitations omitted).  “For an injury to be ‘particularized’ it must affect the [party] in a personal and \nindividual way.” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339 (internal citations omitted).  The injury-in-fact must also \nbe concrete. See id.  “Injuries are concrete only if they bear a ‘close relationship’ to injuries that \ncourts have traditionally recognized as concrete.” Perez v. McCreary, Veselka, Bragg & Allen, P.C., \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 17 of 56\n     \n \n45 F.4th 816, 822 (5th Cir. 2022).  Without explicit guidance from the Supreme Court, the Fifth \nCircuit urges lower courts to “focus[] on types of harms protected at common law, not the precise \npoint at which those harms become actionable.” Id. (citing to Cranor v. 5 Star Nutrition, L.L.C., \n998 F.3d 686, 693 (5th Cir. 2021)).  In addition to bearing a ‘close relationship’ to injuries courts \nhave historically categorized as concrete, “a ‘concrete’ injury must also be ‘de facto’” meaning \nthat “it must actually exist.”  Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340. \nThe party must also be able to show “a causal connection between the injury and the \nconduct complained of” meaning that “the injury has to be ‘fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged \naction of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  While Article III requires a causal connection between \nthe injury suffered by a party seeking relief, “it doesn’t require a showing of proximate cause or \nthat ‘the defendant’s actions are the very last step in the chain of causation.’” Id.  Lastly, the party \nmust demonstrate “redressability”, meaning it is “‘likely’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that \nthe injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision’” from the court. Lujan, 504 U.S at 561; \nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 168 (2000).   \n1.  Petitioner has suffered an injury-in-fact.  \nPetitioner alleges her injury-in-fact is the “substantial risk of imminent removal under the \nproclamation” thereby circumventing the humanitarian protections available to her under the INA. \nPet’r’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 9, ECF No. 34-1; Reply to Mot. 2, ECF No. 44.  Respondents \nargue Petitioner cannot establish the first element because “it is not clear what injury Petitioner \nclaims is actual and imminent.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Pet’r’s Mot. 7, ECF No. 39.  First, “[i]f it is a \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 18 of 56\n     \n \nclaim that she will not receive notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond to her designation” \nas an alien enemy under Proclamation 10903, “she has not shown that injury at all” because she \nhas already received notice, the instant case is proof using the process she is due, and the fact she \nremains in immigration custody pending a decision in her habeas petition, means her removal is \n“hardly imminent.” Id. at 23.  Second, Respondent argues if Petitioner’s injury is the lawfulness \nof her actual removal, traceability is lacking for class members who may have removal orders \nunder Title 8 because “the removal order itself is an independent authority under which the \nExecutive may remove that putative class member.” Id. at 8.  “Since any removal would be \nauthorized regardless of the validity of the AEA designation . . . there would be no standing for \ninjunctive relief because of a lack of traceability.” Id. \nThird, Respondent argues that although Petitioner herself does not have a removal order \nunder Title 8, as well as for any class members without said order, “there is still no showing of a \nclear likelihood that the Executive will remove those aliens without the due process that the \ngovernment has already said those aliens would receive.” Id.  Fourth, if Petitioner claims the \nalleged harm she will suffer would occur while in El Salvador or another country to which she is \nremoved, “those allegations cannot suffice for purposes of standing in this proceeding” because \nthey are “speculative,” and “[a]ny harms that might befall Petitioner abroad are alleged to be the \nresult of independent actions of third parties” insufficient to establish standing. Id. at 8–9. The \nCourt finds Respondents’ arguments unpersuasive.    \nPetitioner has established an injury-in-fact.  Most simply, Petitioner is requesting injunctive \nrelief, which alone is enough to establish the injury-in-fact element of standing. See D.B.U. v. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 19 of 56\n     \n \nTrump, No. 25-CV-01163, 2025 WL 1304288, at *2 (D. Colo. May 6, 2025) (citing Green-Cooper \nv. Brinker Int’l, Inc., 73 F.4th 883, 889 (11th Cir. 2023) (“For purposes of the concrete injury \nanalysis under Article III, we have recognized three kinds of harm [including] a ‘material risk of \nfuture harm’ when plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief.”)).  Further, Petitioner’s detention in \nimmigration custody impacts her liberty and property rights and is independently sufficient to \nestablish an injury-in-fact that is concrete and particularized. Pet. 9, ECF No. 1; see United States \nv. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987) (“In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to \ntrial or without trial is a carefully limited exception.”).  Contrary to Respondents’ assertion \n“Petitioner has not been removed for over a month and the Government generally will not remove \nan alien under the AEA while their habeas petition is pending,” the fact Petitioner has yet to be \nremoved is inconsequential. Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Pet’r’s Mot. 9, ECF No. 39.  \nFurther, the Court recognizes the instant proceedings lend to the conclusion Petitioner had \nnotice of her designation and has been afforded the opportunity to seek judicial review.  However, \nlike a similar case in Colorado, Petitioner’s “habeas challenge is not merely about the notice to \nwhich they are entitled as a due process matter . . . [t]hey also challenge ‘threshold issues’” as to \nthe lawfulness of Proclamation 10903. See D.B.U, 2025 WL 1304288, at *2.  It would indeed be \nironic if because an individual receives notice of their designation and files a habeas petition, they \nwould then be kicked out of court for a lack of standing, left unable to seek judicial review of other \nissues of their confinement.  While it is true that Petitioner is receiving some form of process to \nchallenge Proclamation 10903, due process is the floor, not the ceiling.  For these reasons, \nPetitioner has established an injury-in-fact. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 20 of 56\n     \n \n2.  Petitioner has established causation.  \nPetitioner  also  establishes  causation  between  her  injury  and  Respondents’  actions.  \nRespondents designated Petitioner an alien enemy pursuant to Proclamation 10903.  Petitioner is \ncurrently in immigration custody solely because of this designation, as she has no removal order \nunder Title 8.  Reply to Mot. 2, ECF No. 44.  But for President Trump’s issuance of Proclamation \n10903, it is unlikely that either Petitioner, or other class members similarly lacking Title 8 removal \norders,  would  be  in  immigration  custody.   The  harm  is  directly  related  to  and  caused  by \nRespondents. \nFurther, Respondents argue that although Petitioner does not have a removal order under \nTitle 8, “there is still no showing of a clear likelihood that the Executive will remove those aliens \n[in the class without a removal order] without the due process that the government has already said \nthose aliens would receive.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 8, ECF No. 39.  Respondents’ assertion stands \non weak footing given the emergent intervention multiple courts, including the Supreme Court, \nhave been forced to take by Respondents attempting hasty removals pursuant to Proclamation \n10903. See e.g. A.A.R.P., 145 S. Ct. at 1034 (“The Government is directed not to remove any \nmember of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court”) \n(issued at 1:18 AM EST on Saturday, Apr. 19, 2025).  For these reasons, Petitioner has established \ncausation.  \n3.  Petitioner establishes redressability.  \nFinally, Petitioner can show that it is likely her injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision of this Court.  A favorable decision from this Court would prevent Petitioner and her class \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 21 of 56\n     \n \nmembers from being removed from the United States pursuant to Proclamation 10903 by declaring \nProclamation 10903 unlawful.  An order by this Court would also ensure certified class members \nwho have yet to be designated alien enemies would have the ability to challenge their designation.  \nFor these reasons, Petitioner has demonstrated redressability.  Petitioner has met her burden to \nestablish standing by showing an injury-in-fact, causation of the injury attributable to Respondents, \nand redressability if this Court were to find in her favor.  For the reasons previously articulated, \nPetitioner has standing.  \nB.  Petitioner’s claims are justiciable. \n  At the outset, Respondents allege this Court is without authority to hear Petitioner’s claims, \n“except the narrow review permitted regarding whether Petitioner is an alien enemy.” Resp’ts’ \nOpp’n to Mot. 7, ECF No. 39.  This is plainly wrong26. The Supreme Court has made clear \n“[a]lthough judicial review under the AEA is limited . . . an individual subject to detention and \nremoval under that statute is entitled to ‘judicial review’ as to ‘questions of interpretation and \nconstitutionality’ of the Act as well as whether he or she “is in fact an alien enemy fourteen years \nof age or older.” J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1006 (citing Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 163, 172, n. 17).  Petitioner’s \n \n26 Every other district court considering the threshold challenges to Proclamation 10903 on the \nmerits agree those claims are reviewable. See, e.g., J.A.V. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-072, 2025 WL \n1257450, at *14–18 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025) (granting summary judgment on ground that there is \nno invasion or predatory incursion within the meaning of the AEA); J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5067, \n2025 WL 914682, at *8–10 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025) (Henderson, J., concurring) (rejecting \ngovernment’s invasion and predatory incursion arguments); D.B.U. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01163, \n2025 WL 1304288, at *4 (D. Colo. May 6, 2025) (rejecting Respondents’ statutory arguments); \nG.F.F. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-2886, 2025 WL 1301052, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 6, 2025) (holding that \ncourts, by their nature, interpret statutes); A.S.R. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-00113, 2025 WL 1378784, \nat *11 (W.D. Pa. May 13, 2025) (finding that the court can interpret the meaning of words within \nthe proclamation). \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 22 of 56\n     \n \nclaims that the AEA’s statutory predicates have not been met—because TdA is not a “nation or \ngovernment,” and is not engaged in an “invasion” or “predatory incursion”—are fully within this \nCourt’s jurisdiction to review.  Further, Petitioner’s claims that Proclamation 10903 violates the \nINA  and  the  Fifth  Amendment’s  Due  Process  Clause  involve  questions  of  statutory  and \nconstitutional import, which may also be reviewed by this Court.  \n  The Court finds Respondents’ interpretation of Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 166–70, and the lower \ncourt decisions Respondents cite in their Response in Opposition, unpersuasive.  Respondents cite \nto Ludecke to support their position that “[t]he very nature of the President’s power to order the \nremoval of all enemy aliens rejects the notion that courts may pass judgment upon the exercise of \nhis discretion.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 10, ECF No. 39.  But the larger context of this proposition \nin Ludecke refutes Respondent’s narrow view of the Supreme Court’s precedent.  In fact, Ludecke \nitself reached the merits of the statutory question presented there: whether a “declared war” no \nlonger existed within the meaning of the Act when “actual hostilities” had ceased—i.e., the \n“shooting war” had ended. 335 U.S. at 166–70.  The Supreme Court concluded, on the merits, that \nthe statutory term “declared war” did not mean “actual hostilities,” and that once Congress declares \nwar, the war continues for purposes of the AEA until the political branches declare it over. Id. at \n167–169  ((“‘The  state  of  war’  may  be  terminated  by  treaty  or  legislation  or  Presidential \nproclamation. Whatever the modes, its termination is a political act.”). \n  Nor is the political question doctrine a bar to this Court’s jurisdiction.  In general, the \nJudiciary has a responsibility to decide cases properly before it, even those it “would gladly \navoid.” Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 404 (1821).  Precedent has identified a narrow exception \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 23 of 56\n     \n \nto that rule, known as the “political question” doctrine. See, e.g., Japan Whaling Assn. v. American \nCetacean Soc., 478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986) (“[t]he political question doctrine excludes from judicial \nreview those controversies which” should be “committed for resolution to the halls of Congress or \nthe confines of the Executive Branch.”).  A controversy “involves a political question . . . where \nthere is ‘a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political \ndepartment; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.’” Nixon \nv. United States, 506 U.S. 224, 228 (1993) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962)).  In \nsuch a case, a court “lacks the authority to decide the dispute before it.”  Zivotofsky ex rel. \nZivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 195 (2012).  \n  Here,  Respondents  argue  this  case  involves  a  political  question  because  deciding \nPetitioner’s claims would force the Judiciary to interfere with the President’s exercise of discretion, \nwhich is “no different from the President’s determination to trigger the Constitution’s Invasion \nClause (Article IV, section 4).” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 10, ECF No. 39.  This misunderstands the \nissue presented.  Petitioner does not ask this Court to determine the wisdom of the President’s \ndecision to invoke the AEA instead of removing people under Title 8.   She instead seeks to \ndetermine whether her removal pursuant to Proclamation 10903 comports with the AEA and other \nexisting federal laws, thereby creating a separate and independent removal power for the first time \nin nearly 84 years.27  \n  Respondents’ argument has also been foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s directives in \nJ.G.G. and A.A.R.P.  See J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1006 (recognizing courts may resolve questions of \n \n27 As the Court has previously mentioned, the AEA had not been invoked in 1941.  \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 24 of 56\n     \n \nthe AEA’s “interpretation and constitutionality”); see generally A.A.R.P., 145 S. Ct. at 1370 \n(remanding  to  consider  whether  the  AEA  authorizes  removal  pursuant  to  Proclamation \n10903).  Judicial review of Petitioner’s challenges preserves the separation of powers by ensuring \nthat any president does not exceed the specific authority Congress delegated in the AEA.  Judicial \nreview in this case is just another function of the core principle of our democracy – the checks and \nbalances each co-equal branch of our government has the duty to carry out.  Any assertion by \nRespondents this is not the case is unsubstantiated by precedent and law.  \nC.  Proclamation 10903 is unlawful because it does not comport with the AEA, does not \ncomport with the Constitution, and seeks to render the INA’s relief from removal void.   \n  To be clear, the Court is assessing whether Proclamation 10903, as a stand-alone executive \norder, is lawful.  In assessing the legality of Proclamation 10903, the Court will address three key \nways in which Proclamation 10903 falls short on its face.  The Court need not look beyond the \nfour corners of Proclamation 10903 to see the obvious legal defects it entails.  \n1.  Proclamation 10903 does not comport with the statutory bounds of the Alien \nEnemies Act. \n  Petitioner  argues  Proclamation  10903  is  unlawful  because  its  implementation  is \ninconsistent with the AEA. Pet. 22, ECF No. 1.  Under the AEA, a president cannot unilaterally \ndefine what constitutes an invasion, summarily declare that a foreign nation or government has \nthreatened or perpetrated an invasion or predatory incursion of the United States, identify alien \nenemies subject to detention or removal, and summarily remove them. See J.A.V., 2025 WL \n1257450 at *1; Cf. United States v. Abbott, 110 F.4th 700, 736 (5th Cir. 2024) (“[t]o be sure, a state \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 25 of 56\n     \n \nof invasion under Article I, section 10 does not exist just because a State official has uttered a \ncertain magic word.”) (Ho, J., concurring).  \n  This Court need not look beyond the four corners of Proclamation 10903 to find its severe \ndeficiencies in comporting with the AEA.  Even accepting every assertion in Proclamation 10903 \nas true, it does not rise to meet the plain, ordinary meanings of the statutory terms.  Any \nproclamation by a sitting president attempting to invoke the AEA by executive order must include \nsufficient factual statements, including reference to other pronouncements, to enable a court to \ndetermine whether the conduct and events satisfy the conditions that support the invocation of the \nstatute.  For the foregoing reasons, the Court agrees Proclamation 10903 does not meet the \nstatutory preconditions to lawfully invoke the AEA and its powers. \na.  Proclamation  10903  does  not  establish  an  “invasion”  or  “predatory \nincursion” within the meaning of the AEA. \n  Petitioner alleges no “invasion” or “predatory incursion” has occurred, been threatened, or \nbeen attempted. Pet’r’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 16–20, ECF No. 34-1.  In accordance with \nestablished principles of statutory construction, a court begins with a plain reading of the text of \nthe statute.  Courts normally interpret statutory terms “consistent with their ordinary meaning at \nthe time Congress enacted the statute.” Wisconsin Cent. Ltd v. United States, 585 U.S. 274, 277 \n(2018) (internal citation omitted).  When ascertaining the plain, ordinary meaning of founding era \nlanguage, courts rely on contemporaneous dictionary definitions and historical records that reveal \nthe common usage of the terms at issue. See, e.g., D.C. v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 581–83 (2008) \n(examining founding era writings and commentaries to determine the commonly understood \nmeaning of “keep and bear arms”); Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 492 (2002) (Thomas, J., \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 26 of 56\n     \n \nconcurring) (“Dictionary definitions contemporaneous with the ratification of the Constitution \ninform our understanding.”). \n  In the present context, Judge Fernando Rodriguez, Jr.’s (“Judge Rodriguez”) analysis in \nJ.A.V. is informative28.  In reaching his decision, Judge Rodriguez surveyed several sources from \n1780 to 1820 using primarily Founders Online29, a database of historical records that the National \nArchives maintains. J.A.V., 2025 WL 1257450 at *16.  This Court incorporates these sources in \nfull by reference.30  Judge Rodriguez found “the plain, ordinary meaning of “invasion” was an \nentry into the nation’s territory by a military force or an organized, armed force, with the purpose \nof conquering or obtaining control over territory.” Id. at 16.  Further, “the common usage of \n‘predatory incursion’ and, to a lesser degree,  ‘incursion,’ referenced  a military force  or  an \norganized, armed force entering a territory to destroy property, plunder, and harm individuals, with \na subsequent retreat from that territory.” Id.  Judge Rodriguez further found “an ‘invasion’ . . . must \ninvolve an organized, armed force entering the United States to engage in conduct destructive of \nproperty and human life in a specific geographical area.” Id. at 17. \n  This Court agrees the plain, ordinary meaning of “invasion” and “predatory incursion,” as \nthe terms were understood in 1798, require a militarized effort against, and militarized intrusion \ninto, the territory of the United States with the specific purpose31 of conquering or obtaining \n \n28 See generally J.A.V., 2025 WL 1257450 at *12–19. \n29 Courts have used this database for similar analyses. See, e.g., Carpenter v. United States, 585 \nU.S.  296,  347  (2018)  (Thomas,  J.,  dissenting)  (using  the  database  to  note  that  the  phrase \n“expectation(s) of privacy” did not appear in “the papers of the prominent Founders”). \n30 See J.A.V., 2025 WL 1257450 at *16 (Appendix A) (identifying records and providing links). \n31 This Court’s reading of the terms “invasion” and “predatory incursion” do not limit a president’s \npower to invoke the AEA when there is a declared war.  \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 27 of 56\n     \n \ncontrol over territory.  This Court rejects Respondents’ invitation to broaden the meaning of these \nterms.  Ascertaining the plain, ordinary meaning of a term has never required a court to expand its \nreach to encompass all possible definitions.  \n  While Respondents argue “[c]onsidering ‘invasion’ or ‘predatory incursion’ to apply only \nto. . . a rudimentary understanding of warfare—a type of warfare becoming extinct—not only fails \nto comport with contemporaneous understanding and usage, but also renders the AEA irrelevant \nin modern times, contrary to Congress’s intent,” it is not in this Court’s province to legislate to \naccommodate  such  modernization.  See  Resp’ts’  Opp’n  to  Mot.  17,  ECF  No.  39.    Policy \nconsiderations meant to enlarge the meaning of terms beyond how they were understood at the \ntime of the founding have no place in this Court’s analysis.  If Congress deems this modernization \nof warfare, as Respondents characterize it, renders the plain meaning of the AEA irrelevant, it can \ncertainly legislate to amend the statute.  This Court, however, will not engage in that sort of \npolicymaking.   \n  Upon defining the statutory terms, the Court looks to the four corners of Proclamation \n10903 to determine whether the assertions rise to meet the ordinary, plain meaning of “invasion” \nor “predatory incursion.”  For purposes of this analysis, this Court will accept all assertions as \ntrue.32 Even then, it is clear they do not rise to the level of an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” \nas defined in the AEA.  Proclamation 10903 alleges TdA “has engaged in and continues to engage \nin mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States \n \n32 This Court reserves ruling as to its authority to review the veracity of the factual assertions set \nforth in Proclamation 10903.  \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 28 of 56\n     \n \ncitizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime’s goal of destabilizing \ndemocratic nations in the Americas, including the United States.” Proclamation No. 10903, 90 \nFed. Reg. 13033 (Mar. 14, 2025). \n  Mass illegal migration or criminal activities plainly do not fall within the AEA’s statutory \nboundaries.  Proclamation 10903 does not assert TdA is acting as an army or a military force.  Nor \nis the stated purpose for entry into the United States territory with an intent to gain a territorial \nfoothold on the United States for military purposes.  TdA’s alleged actions are simply not “against \nthe territory”33 of the United States.  This Court does not minimize the important interest the \nExecutive Branch has in combating these activities.  Yet, it is equally important that the Executive’s \nmethods for combating these activities comport with the laws enacted by Congress, including \nremoval authority under the INA, and federal criminal laws.  The AEA was clearly not meant to \nbe all-encompassing.  As such, this Court declines to stretch the AEA’s meaning so broadly that \nmass migration or criminal activities by some members of a particular nationality could qualify as \nan “invasion,” and virtually any group, hailing from virtually any country, could be deemed alien \nenemies. \n \n33 Respondents also introduced an FBI Intelligence Assessment that notes “[t]he FBI assesses, in \nthe next 6 to 18 months, some Venezuelan Government officials likely will attempt to leverage \nTdA members in the United States as proxy actors to threaten, abduct, and kill members of the US-\nbased Venezuelan diaspora who are vocal Maduro critics. Ex. C, FBI Intelligence Assessment 6, \nECF No. 54.  \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 29 of 56\n     \n \nb.  Proclamation  10903  does  not  establish  TdA  is  a  “foreign  nation  or \ngovernment” within the meaning of the AEA.  \n  Similarly, Proclamation 10903 does not establish TdA is a “foreign nation or government” \nwithin the meaning of the AEA34. Pet’r’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 20, ECF No. 34-1.  \nRespondents assert “[t]he government is not arguing that TdA is itself a ‘nation.’ But the control \nand  authority  TdA  exercises  in  Venezuela  is  consistent  with  founding  era  definitions  of \n‘government.’”35 Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 21, ECF No. 39.   \n  Proclamation 10903 sets forth several assertions about TdA, including the following.  First, \n“TdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, \nnarco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela.” Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13033 \n(Mar. 14, 2025).  Second, “TdA is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the Maduro \nregime.” Id.  Third, “Maduro leads the regime-sponsored enterprise Cártel de los Soles, which \ncoordinates with and relies on TdA.” Id.  Fourth, “Venezuelan national and local authorities have \nceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including \nTdA.” Id.  Fifth, “TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the \nterritory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the \nMaduro regime in Venezuela.” Id. \n \n34 Petitioner cites Johnson’s Dictionary, Nation (1773) to define “foreign nation or government” as \n“[a]  people  distinguished  from  another  people;  generally  by  their  language,  original,  or \ngovernment.”  Petitioner also cites to Webster’s Dictionary, Nation (1828) defining a “foreign \nnation or government” as “[a] body of people inhabiting the same country or united under the same \nsovereign government; as the English nation.”  \n35 Respondents cite Thomas Dyche & William Pardon, A New General English Dictionary (1754) \nwhich defines “government” as “the power or authority that one person exercises over another.” \n \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 30 of 56\n     \n \n  Notably, what Proclamation 10903 does not say is that TdA is the Venezuelan government.  \nNor does it specify TdA controls any specific territory in Venezuela.  Proclamation 10903 itself \nundermines Respondents assertion in their Response in Opposition that TdA is the Venezuelan \ngovernment. See generally Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13033 (Mar. 14, 2025) (asserting \n“the Maduro-regime has ceded over control to TdA”, yet the “TdA acts at the direction of the \nVenezuelan government”).  Put simply, if TdA was a ‘foreign nation or government’ as required \nby the AEA, there would be no need for it to ‘undertake hostile actions . . . at the direction . . . of \nthe Maduro regime.”  Therefore, Proclamation 10903 fails on its face to meet the definition of a \n“foreign nation or government” as required by the AEA.  \nc.  Proclamation 10903 does not allow for voluntary departure as required by \nthe AEA’s Section 21. \n  As  a  final  matter,  Proclamation  10903  does  not  comport  with  the AEA  because  it \ncategorically bars any opportunity for voluntary departure as required by the AEA’s Section 21.  \nThe AEA refers to voluntary departure in two distinct sections: Section 21 and Section 22.  Section \n21 of the AEA states, in relevant part, “[t]he President is authorized in any such event . . . to provide \nfor the removal of those who, not being permitted to reside within the United States, refuse or \nneglect to depart therefrom.” 50 U.S.C. § 21. On the other hand, Section 22 reads that an alien \nenemy  \nshall be allowed, for the recovery, disposal, and removal of his \ngoods and effects, and for his departure, the full time which is or \nshall be stipulated by any treaty then in force between the United \nStates and the hostile nation or government of which he is a native \ncitizen, denizen, or subject; and where no such treaty exists, or is in \nforce, the President may ascertain and declare such reasonable time \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 31 of 56\n     \n \nas may be consistent with the public safety, and according to the \ndictates of humanity and national hospitality.  \n \nId. at § 22 (emphasis added). \n  In Proclamation 10903, President Trump “find[s] and declare[s] that all such members of \nTdA are, by virtue of their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual hostility against \nthe United States and are therefore ineligible for the benefits of 50 U.S.C. 22… [and] further find[s] \nand declare[s] that all such members of TdA are a danger to the public peace or safety of the United \nStates.” Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13033 (Mar. 14, 2025). Sections 21 and 22, \nPetitioner argues, “afford[] individuals designated as alien enemies an opportunity to voluntarily \ndepart from the United States” and that “the President may lawfully remove noncitizens under the \nAEA only when those designated noncitizens “refuse or neglect to depart” voluntarily.” Pet’r’s \nMem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 14–15, ECF No. 34-1 (emphasis added).   \n  Respondents argue Petitioner’s reading that a voluntary department period is required is \nnot defensible because while “the AEA permits the President to ‘provide for the removal of those \nwho, not being permitted to reside within the United States, refuse or neglect to depart therefrom \n. . . .[,]’ the AEA “also broadly provides that alien enemies within the purview of a Proclamation \n“shall be . . . removed as alien enemies.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 24, ECF No. 39. Respondents \nfurther contend that “[i]n this context, where the alien enemies are members of the hostile force \nitself, the President cannot be required to provide any period of voluntary departure prior to \neffectuating removal” because that would frustrate the AEA’s entire purpose if active participants \nin hostilities must be asked to depart on their own terms. Id. \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 32 of 56\n     \n \nRespondents’ argument is flawed. Based on a plain reading of Section 21, an opportunity \nto voluntary depart is a statutory condition precedent to removal. See U.S. ex rel. Ludwig v. \nWatkins, 164 F.2d 456, 457 (2d Cir. 1947).  As Petitioner sets forth36, courts interpreting the AEA \nduring World War II consistently recognized that alien enemies retained a right to voluntary \ndeparture under Section 21 of the AEA.  On its face, Section 22 of the AEA reads to establish \nseparate rights concerning specific conditions for departure as they relate to bilateral treaties or \n“national hospitality”, with an exception for those “chargeable with actual hostility, or some other \ncrime against public safety.” See 50 U.S.C. § 22.  While the president retains control over the \nterms37 of voluntary departure under Section 21, based on the plain language, he must allow for \nsome opportunity to do so.  Further, the statute calls for an individualized assessment as it relates \nto voluntary departure.  Therefore, Proclamation 10903 does not comport with the AEA because it \ndenies the statutory condition precedent of voluntary departure pror to involuntary removal under \nthe AEA. \n \n36 See Pet’r’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 12, ECF No. 34-1 (citing U.S. ex rel. Ludwig, 164 \nF.2d at 457 (Section 21 establishes a “right of voluntary departure.”); U.S. ex rel. Von Heymann v. \nWatkins, 159 F.2d 650, 653 (2d Cir. 1947) (holding that the detainee’s “present restraint by the \nrespondent is unlawful in so far as it interferes with his voluntary departure, since the enforced \nremoval, of which his present restraint is a concomitant, is unlawful before he does ‘refuse or \nneglect’ to depart.”); United States ex rel. Dorfler v. Watkins, 171 F.2d 431, 432 (2d Cir. 1948) \n(“An alien must be afforded the privilege of voluntary departure before the Attorney General can \nlawfully remove him against his will.”)). \n37 Section 21 of the AEA gives the President the authority “to establish any other regulations which \nare found necessary in the premises and for the public safety,” but does not allow him to summarily \ndeny the opportunity to voluntary depart as plainly stated earlier in the statute.  \n \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 33 of 56\n     \n \n2.  Proclamation 10903 violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \nPetitioner argues Proclamation 10903 is patently unlawful insofar as it seeks to summarily \nremove noncitizens without adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to challenge “alien \nenemy” designations without due process of law as expressly required by the Constitution. Pet’r’s \nMem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 13–14, ECF No. 34-1.  Conversely, Respondents argue the AEA is \na wartime authority designed to allow for the quick expulsion of alien enemies from the United \nStates and doesn’t impose specific notice or timing requirements. Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 22, ECF \nNo. 39.  Respondents further argue that “[e]ven if Petitioner is entitled to some due process, what \nis owed is “flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.” \nId. at 22–23, ECF No. 39 (citing Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972)). \na.  Noncitizens are entitled to due process in any removal proceeding. \n  It bears repeating that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and no law, whether \npromulgated by Congress or by Executive Order, may exceed constitutional bounds.  Let there be \nno doubt – every person, on United States soil, regardless of their legal status, is entitled to due \nprocess of law under the Constitution in deportation proceedings. See Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. \n292, 306 (1993) (“It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles [noncitizens] to due \nprocess of law in deportation proceedings.”). As such, “it is not competent for . . . any executive \nofficer . . . arbitrarily to cause an alien who has entered the country, and has become subject in all \nrespects to its jurisdiction, and a part of its population, although alleged to be illegally here, to be \ntaken into custody and deported without giving him all opportunity to be heard upon the questions \ninvolving his right to be and remain in the United States.” Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86, 101 \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 34 of 56\n     \n \n(1903).  “No such arbitrary power can exist where the principles involved in due process of law \nare recognized.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n  A president’s authority under the AEA is no different and remains constrained by due \nprocess principles.  In the present case, the Court is not presented with a question of if Petitioner \nand the certified class are entitled to due process. As hundreds of years of precedent have \nestablished, Petitioner and the certified class are definitively entitled to due process. See J.G.G., \n145 S. Ct. at 1006. The question for the Court is simply how much process is due.  \nb.  Respondents  must  provide  at  least  thirty-days  notice  to  noncitizens \ndesignated as alien enemies under the AEA.   \n  As the Supreme Court has already established, detainees under the AEA “are entitled to \nnotice and opportunity to be heard ‘appropriate to the nature of the case.’” J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at \n1006 (citing Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313 (1950)).  “More \nspecifically, in this context, AEA detainees must receive notice . . . that they are subject to removal \nunder the Act.” Id.  This notice “must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner \nas will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.” \nId.  “In order to ‘actually seek habeas relief,’ a detainee must have sufficient time and information \nto reasonably be able to contact counsel, file a petition, and pursue appropriate relief.” A.A.R.P., \n145 S. Ct. at 1368.  While the Supreme Court did not specify how much notice is due, it made \nclear “notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due \nprocess rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster.” Id. \n  This  Court  looks  to  prior  invocations  of  the  AEA  to  determine  what  notice  is \nconstitutionally compelled in this context.  During World War II, President Truman invoked the \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 35 of 56\n     \n \nAEA after Congress declared war between the United States and Japan, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, \nHungary, and Rumania38. Pres. Proc. No. 2685, 60 Stat. 1342 (Apr. 10, 1946).  At the height of \nthis global conflict, President Truman declared that alien enemies ordered removed under the AEA \nwere allowed a 30-day notice to “effect the recovery, disposal, and removal of his goods, and \neffects, and for his departure.” Id. at § 2.  It follows that when a president seeks to invoke the AEA \nin times when there is decidedly not a declared war, but rather something less in the form of a \npotential “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” that those designated alien enemies must receive at \nthe very least a 30-day notice prior to their removal.  Any President invoking the AEA to address \nan “invasion” or a “predatory incursion” may, of course, allow more time, but surely not less than \nwas given at the height of a declared war.   \n  Respondents argue “a thirty-day notice is both excessive and unnecessary,” but fail to set \nforth specific burdens sufficient to outweigh due process considerations. Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. \n23, ECF No. 39.  On balance, while this Court recognizes a president’s concerns about national \ndefense when invoking the AEA, “[i]t would indeed be ironic if, in the name of national defense, \nwe would sanction the subversion of one of those liberties . . . which makes the defense of the \nNation worthwhile.” United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 264 (1967).   \n  Therefore, the Court finds that when an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” is the basis for \nthe invocation of the AEA, the government must provide alien enemy designees at least a 30-day \nnotice prior to removal.  This notice shall be written in a language the alien enemy designee \nunderstands and must provide information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that \n \n38 Rumania is now spelled as “Romania.” \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 36 of 56\n     \n \nremoval. See generally A.A.R.P., 145 S. Ct. at 1368 (“notice roughly 24 hours before removal, \ndevoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does \nnot pass muster.”). \n  As a final matter, Respondents objected to this Court’s consolidation of the preliminary \ninjunction hearing with the trial on the merits, alleging resolution on the merits is premature given \nthe administration has not yet implemented a new notice policy after the Supreme Court’s A.A.R.P. \ndecision. Resp’ts’ Notice of Obj. 1, ECF No. 49.  To recount, Respondents first began using \nProclamation 10903 without providing any notice at all.  After the Supreme Court’s decision in \nJ.G.G., Respondents changed their policy to provide notice written only in English just twelve \nhours ahead of scheduled removal, and allowing those who affirmatively state they intend to file \na habeas petition only 24 hours to do so. See Pet’r’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 4–5, ECF No. \n34-1 (citing Sarabia Roman Decl., Ex. H, Pet’r’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot., ECF No. 34-10 \nand Cisneros Decl., Ex. A, Pet.’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of TRO, ECF No. 3-2).  Respondents’ \nobjection is overruled because the Court need not wait on yet another iteration of Respondents’ \nattempts to land on a magic number for notice.  Instead, this Court looks to due process principles \nand precedent to ascertain the amount of time necessary to pass constitutional muster.  \n3.  Proclamation 10903 is unlawful because it directly conflicts with the INA regarding \nremoval procedures and bars humanitarian removal protections included in the \nINA.  \n  In the immigration context, all roads lead to the INA.  The AEA cannot be read in isolation.  \nThe interplay between the AEA and the INA is most simply understood as a relationship between \nremoval power versus removal procedure.  To be clear, Plaintiff is not challenging the outcome of \n \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 37 of 56\n     \n \nan individual asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT claim that would generally limit judicial \nintervention; rather she is challenging Proclamation 10903 because it denies the opportunity to \neven assert such claims.  Because Proclamation 10903 categorically bars the INA’s procedures \nfrom applying to removals and does not allow designees to apply for humanitarian protections, it \nis unlawful.  For the reasons stated herein, noncitizens designated for removal solely under the \nAEA may still be entitled to the full removal procedures in Title 8, but at a minimum they must be \nallowed to apply for humanitarian relief from removal.  \na.  The history of the AEA and the INA is indispensable to decipher how the two \nstatutes function with each other. \nThe AEA was enacted in 1798 and last invoked in 1941.  In 1952, the INA codified a \ncomprehensive overhaul of immigration laws, and later included humanitarian relief from removal, \nincluding asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT. See Lehmann v. U.S. ex. rel. Carson, 353 \nU.S. 685, 687 (1957).  The 1798 AEA’s wartime authority grants the President specific powers \nwith respect to the regulation, detention, and removal of individuals designated as alien enemies. \nSee 50 U.S.C. § 21.  As codified today, the AEA provides:  \n[w]henever there is a declared war between the United States and \nany foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory \nincursion  is  perpetrated,  attempted,  or  threatened  against  the \nterritory of the United States by any foreign nation or government, \nand  the  president  makes  public  proclamation  of  the  event,  all \nnatives,  citizens,  denizens,  or  subjects  of  the  hostile  nation  or \ngovernment, being the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall \nbe within the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be \nliable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien \nenemies.  \nId.  \n \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 38 of 56\n     \n \nPrior to Proclamation 10903, “U. S. Presidents have invoked the Alien Enemies Act only \nthree times, each in the context of an ongoing war: the War of 1812, World War I, and World War \nII.” J.G.G. 145 S. Ct. at 1008 (Sotomayor, J. dissenting).  While the AEA has been applied to \ndifferent groups of people during different moments in history, the constant across all previous \ninvocations is that the United States was actively engaged in armed conflict with the nation states \nfrom which the individuals originated. See generally Lockington, 15 F. Cas. at 758–759 (discussing \nthe War of 1812 proclamation); Declaring the Existence of a State of War with the German Empire \nand Setting Forth Regulations Prescribing Conduct Toward Alien Enemies, Proclamation No. \n1364, 40 Stat. 1650 (World War I); Alien Enemies–Japanese, Proclamation No. 2525, 55 Stat. 1700 \n(World War II). \nIn 1952, Congress enacted the INA and codified it in Title 8 of the United States Code \nbeginning in Section 1101. Lehmann, 353 U.S. at 687.  This law “repealed the Immigration Act of \nFebruary 5, 1917, and, in many respects, substantially changed” immigration law in the United \nStates. Id.  The INA controls nearly all aspects of immigration law within the United States.  \nRelevant to the case at hand, Section 1229a governs removal proceedings and states, \n [u]nless otherwise specified in this chapter, a proceeding under this \nsection shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining \nwhether an alien may be admitted to the United States or, if the alien \nhas been so admitted, removed from the United States. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3).   \n  The present case involves three types of later-enacted humanitarian relief from removal: \nasylum, withholding of removal, and CAT.  In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, the need for a \nchange in American policy concerning refugees became apparent as hundreds of thousands of \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 39 of 56\n     \n \nVietnamese and Cambodians fled political chaos and physical danger in their homelands39.  In \nresponse, Congress passed, and President Jimmy Carter signed, the Refugee Act of 1980, which \nnot only provided for the admission and adjustment of status of refugees but also established \nprocedures for aliens to seek asylum. See Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 \n(1980).  Asylum is now codified in Title 8 Section 1158, and states “[a]ny alien who is physically \npresent in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port \nof arrival[)] . . . irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this \nsection . . . .” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  Although the opportunity to apply for asylum is far-reaching, \nto be eligible for asylum, applicants must be able “to establish that the applicant is a refugee within \nthe meaning of” Section 1101(a)(42)(A), meaning “the applicant must establish race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one \ncentral reason for persecuting the applicant.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(1)(A) – (B)(i).    \nCodified in Section 1231(b)(3), withholding of removal is a separate form of relief which \nrestricts the Attorney General from “remov[ing] an alien to a country if the Attorney General \ndecides that the alien’s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien’s \nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). Notably, this Section does not limit the availability of withholding of removal \nto individuals ordered removed under Title 8.  \n \n39 Refugee Act of 1980, National Archives Foundation, \nhttps://archivesfoundation.org/documents/refugee-act-1980 [https://perma.cc/N3VN-98TK] (last \naccessed June 6, 2025). \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 40 of 56\n     \n \n  Lastly, in 1988, the United States was a signatory to the Article 3 of the United Nations \nConvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \n(“CAT”), art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 114 (1988).  Article 3 \nof CAT expressly prohibits the United States from returning any person to a country in which it is \nmore likely than not that he or she “would be in danger of being subjected to torture.” Id.  CAT is \na treaty signed and ratified by the United States but is not self-executing. 136 Cong. Rec. 36,198 \n(1990).  Congress, however, implemented the treaty by statute as part of the Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”). 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note (2000); see also C.F.R. \n§§ 208.16 to 208.18 (FARRA procedure).  That statute declares it “the policy of the United States \nnot to . . . extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which \nthere are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to \ntorture.” Id. Although Article III courts are generally unable to review CAT determinations, \nimmigration courts are generally compelled to make a CAT determination if a noncitizen raises \ntorture claims. \nb.  The President’s power under the AEA does not summarily override the INA’s \nremoval  procedures  and  the  availability  of  humanitarian  relief  from \nremoval. \n  A key issue before the Court is the interplay between two statutes seemingly in conflict.  \nThere is no question the INA was passed after the AEA and has since been amended multiple times.  \nThe question for this Court is, therefore, whether the AEA categorically overrides the INA— \na later-enacted law Congress passed with full knowledge of the AEA.  Based on principles of \nstatutory interpretation, the Court finds the AEA does conflict, at least in part, with the INA’s “sole \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 41 of 56\n     \n \nand exclusive” removal procedure, as well as with the humanitarian protections the INA affords.  \nBecause Proclamation 10903 categorically bars any application of the INA to removals thereunder, \nProclamation 10903 is unlawful.  To be clear, this Court is not ruling on whether the Alien Enemies \nAct, as enacted in 1798, is unlawful or unconstitutional, but only that Proclamation 10903 does \nnot comport with the legal mandates of the INA. \ni.  Respondents must follow the INA’s “sole and exclusive” procedures of \nremoval for AEA designees who have been admitted into the United \nStates. \nAs a preliminary matter, Respondents assert “immigration laws and [the] AEA have been \nread harmoniously for over 75 years.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 25, ECF No. 39 (citing to U.S. ex \nrel Von Kleczowski v. Watkins, 71 F.Supp. 429, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 1947)).  Respondents’ argument is \nmisleading, if not intentionally so.  Until 2025, no president since the 1940s had invoked the AEA.  \nAs such, courts have not had the occasion to discuss the interplay between the INA, as enacted in \n1952, and the 1798 AEA.   \n  “[T]he general proposition that courts should not look past the words of a clear statute—\noften called the ‘plain meaning rule’—is a common judicial proposition.” Barbee v. United States, \n392 F.2d 532, 535 n.4 (5th Cir. 1968) (citations omitted).  The “first step in interpreting a statute \nis to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard \nto  the  particular  dispute  in  the  case.  Our  inquiry  must  cease  if  the  statutory  language  is \nunambiguous and “the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 \nU.S. 337, 340 (1997).  “[W]hen the statute’s language is plain,” “at least where the disposition \n \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 42 of 56\n     \n \nrequired by the text is not absurd,” the sole function of a court is to enforce it according to its \nterms. Lamie v. U.S. Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004) (internal citations omitted).   \nHere, the AEA allows a President to “provide for the removal” of alien enemies assuming all \nother statutory preconditions are met but does not give specific procedures for removal.  The INA’s \nSection 1229a broadly governs removal proceedings and states: \n[u]nless otherwise specified in this chapter, a proceeding under this \nsection shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining \nwhether an alien may be admitted to the United States or, if the alien \nhas been so admitted, removed from the United States. \n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3).  \n  Based on the plain meaning of the text in each statute, the interplay between the two statutes \ncan be best understood as creating two categories: (1) noncitizens subject to the AEA who have \nbeen admitted to the United States, and (2) noncitizens subject to the AEA who have not been \nadmitted to the United States. \n  Admissibility  into  the  United  States  is  a  function  of Title  8.40    Notably,  a  positive \nadmissibility determination does not inherently grant a person any immigration benefit, including \nresidency or citizenship. See e.g. 8 U.S.C. § 1255 (outlining the multiple requirements to become \na lawful permanent resident).  For our purposes, it is important to note Proclamation 10903 applies \nto Venezuelan nationals “within the United States, [who] are not actually naturalized or lawful \npermanent residents of the United States.”  Based on its text, a noncitizen deemed admissible may \nstill be subject to Proclamation 10903.  \n \n40  See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(13)(A) (“The terms ‘admission’ and ‘admitted’ mean, with respect to an \nalien, the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an \nimmigration officer.”) \n \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 43 of 56\n     \n \n  Here, Petitioner falls into the first category encompassing noncitizens subject to the AEA \nwho have been admitted into the United States.  Petitioner is not a naturalized citizen or lawful \npermanent resident and is currently subject to removal under the AEA. Pet. 8, ECF No. 1. Petitioner \nhas also been previously granted TPS. Id.  Because a noncitizen must be deemed admissible to be \neligible for TPS41, Respondents would be compelled by Section 1229a to employ the INA’s “sole \nand exclusive” procedures for determining whether Petitioner, as an alien admitted to the United \nStates, may be removed, even if the reason for her removal is under the AEA.  As such, even \nthough the AEA can serve as a basis to designate someone removable from the United States, in \norder to give effect to the plain language of the INA, removal for noncitizens admitted to the United \nStates must be carried out in accordance with the removal procedures established in the INA.  In \nsum, Respondents must follow the INA’s procedure for removal under Section 1229a for any \nnoncitizen subject to removal under the AEA who has been admitted into the United States.  In \ndoing so, AEA designees who have been previously admitted into the United States will have the \nopportunity to apply to humanitarian relief from removal as generally permitted under Title 8. \n  Further, the Court agrees with Petitioner that if Congress wanted to include the AEA’s \nremoval power as a categorical exception to the INA’s “sole and exclusive” removal procedure \nprovision, it would have done so. Pet’r’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 27–28, ECF No. 34-1; \nReply to Mot. 9, ECF No. 44 (“[W]hile Congress knew of the AEA when it enacted the INA, it \n \n41 Form I-821, Instructions for Application for Temporary Protected Status, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND \nIMMIGRATION SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, https://www.uscis.gov/sites/def\nault/files/document/forms/i-821instr.pdf [https://perma.cc/LS6J-CJFM] (“To be eligible for TPS, \nyou must be admissible to the United States as an immigrant under the applicable grounds in INA \nsection 212(a)”). \n \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 44 of 56\n     \n \ndeliberately declined to exclude AEA-based removals from this statutory scheme—even as it \ncarved out express exceptions elsewhere.”) (“[s]ee, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1531.”); see also \nMiles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19. 32 (1990) (noting the Supreme Court “assume[s] \nCongress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.”) (citation omitted).   \n  While this Court recognizes the INA and the AEA are two separate ways to subject an \nindividual to removal, they can and must be read harmoniously.  Respondents contend that “[e]ven \nif there were a conflict between the AEA and the INA, the AEA would control here” because “it is \na commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to \nMot. 25, ECF No. 39 (citing to Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 384 (1991)).  \nRespondents argue “the AEA provides specific rules for removing a subset of aliens—those \ndesignated alien enemies—against the more general provisions relating to removability provided \nby the INA.” Id. at 25–26.  The Court takes this cannon of specific governing the general to lend \nto a different conclusion.  The AEA generally provides for the removal of those designated alien \nenemies and does not proscribe any specific procedures that must be followed.  On the other hand, \nthe INA provides it is the “sole and exclusive” procedure to determine specifically whether a \nnoncitizen who has been admitted to the United States may be removed.  As such, the question of \nwhat procedures must be followed to remove a noncitizen is not answered by which statutory \nauthority he or she is designated removable, but rather on whether any allegedly removable \nnoncitizen was previously admitted into the United States.  \n \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 45 of 56\n     \n \nii.  Noncitizens not previously admitted into the United States and subject \nto  the AEA  remain  eligible  to  apply  for  humanitarian  relief  from \nremoval. \nThere is yet to be a specific procedure applied to noncitizens who fall in the second \ncategory and are subject to the AEA but have not previously been admitted into the United States.  \nAs previously stated, Proclamation 10903 is unlawful because it categorically forecloses any \nopportunity to invoke congressionally afforded relief from removal under Title 8.  Respondents \ncontend “individuals subject to removal under Title 50 are barred from asylum and withholding of \nremoval.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 27, ECF No. 39.  In other words, Respondents assert that if an \nindividual is subject to removal under the AEA, then they have no rights under the INA.  \nRespondents further argue that because “[t]he United States continues to abide by its policy not to \nremove aliens to countries in which they are likely to be tortured,” there is therefore “no direct \nconflict between the United States’ obligations under the CAT as codified by the FARRA and \nremovals under the AEA.” Id. at 26. \nBecause of the clear language of the asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT laws, AEA \ndesignees in the second category retain the right to apply for such relief in immigration courts.  To \nbe clear, this Court is not asserting that Article III courts may decide the merits of any such claims. \nThe extent of the Court’s decision today is that based on due process and the plain language of \neach statute.  A congressionally afforded opportunity to apply for humanitarian relief from removal \ncannot be stripped away by the AEA’s removal power.  \nTake  asylum,  for  example.    Section  1158  unequivocally  states  “[a]ny  alien  who  is \nphysically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States [,]whether or not at a \ndesignated port of arrival . . . irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for asylum in accordance \n \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 46 of 56\n     \n \nwith this section.” 8. U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  We need only to read the statute to see how broad the \nopportunity to apply for asylum is.  The opportunity to apply is contingent on one thing: presence \non U.S. soil, regardless of how one entered.  There is no exception written by Congress from this \nopportunity to apply for asylum for people subject to the AEA, and this Court declines to read an \nexception into it.  As such, the AEA’s removal powers do not strip away an individual’s right to \napply for asylum. \n  The same is true for withholding of removal.  The opportunity to apply for withholding of \nremoval is not cabined by the underlying reason or authority for removal.  Section 1231(b)(3)(A) \nstates “[n]ot withstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Attorney General may not remove an alien \nto a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in \nthat country because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social \ngroup, or political opinion.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(a).  Yet again, there is no language in the statute \nthat limits when an individual ordered removed may apply for this relief.  \n  Lastly, AEA designees must be given an opportunity to apply for CAT relief to comply with \ninternational law.  Respondents’ assertion that CAT relief is not being infringed on because the \nUnited States avoids removals to countries42 where noncitizens will likely be tortured is not \nenough.  The Court agrees with Petitioners that protections under CAT “categorically prohibit[] \n \n42 This assertion is heavily contradicted by evidence in the record detailing the alleged human rights \nviolations perpetrated in El Salvador's Center for Terrorism Confinement (“CECOT”) prison, \nwhere nearly 200 people have been deported. See Pet’r’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 29, ECF \nNo. 34-1 (“Prison officials there engage in widespread physical abuse, including waterboarding, \nelectric shocks, using implements of torture on detainees’ fingers, forcing detainees into ice water \nfor hours, and hitting or kicking detainees so severely that it causes broken bones or ruptured \norgans. Ex. D (Bishop. Decl.) ¶¶ 21, 33, 37, 39, 41; Ex. E (Goebertus Decl.) ¶¶ 8, 10, 17.”). \n \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 47 of 56\n     \n \nreturning a noncitizen to any country where they would more likely than not face torture.” Pet’r’s \nMem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 25, ECF No. 34-1 (citing 8 U.S.C.§ 1231 note).  It would be \nimpossible for Respondents to know whether an individual may be more likely than not to face \ntorture without the opportunity to address an immigration judge and present evidence.  CAT \nprotections apply regardless of the authority for removal.  As such, AEA designees must be given \nthe opportunity to apply for CAT relief in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.  \n  Nothing in this Court’s analysis should be construed as a directive to the Executive in \ndetermining  the  merits  of  an  individual  asylum,  withholding  of  removal,  or  CAT  claim.  \nEntitlement to such relief is at the discretion of the Executive, but the opportunity to apply for such \nrelief afforded by Congress is not.  Therefore, each individual AEA designee must still be afforded \nthe opportunity to raise its claims for relief from removal and have such claims adjudicated \npursuant to the procedures set forth by Congress.  \niii.  This Court’s framework adequately accounts for due process under Title \n8, the power of the Executive under the AEA, and Supreme Court \nprecedent. \nAs a final matter, the Court notes this framework allows the President to use his executive \npower  in  designating  individuals  “alien  enemies”  under  the  AEA,  gives  full  effect  to \ncongressionally enacted avenues for humanitarian relief from removal under the INA, and does \nnot  disrupt  the  process  set  forth  by  the  Supreme  Court  for  challenging  an  “alien  enemy” \ndesignation in Article III courts through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  As this Court has \npreviously cautioned, this opinion does not venture to invalidate the entirety of the AEA, but rather \nsolely invalidates Proclamation 10903 as it was issued.  \n \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 48 of 56\n     \n \n  For clarity, this Court sums up its findings regarding the interplay between the INA, the \nAEA, and the Supreme Court’s mandates.  Under the AEA, a president retains the authority to \ndesignate individuals as “alien enemies” and establish a basis for removability pursuant to the \ncriteria set forth within a properly enacted proclamation invoking the AEA.  Once designated, an \nindividual will be entitled to a thirty-day notice and opportunity to file a habeas petition to \nchallenge the lawfulness of their detention and their designation as alien enemies.  \n  If an AEA designee has been previously admitted into the United States, Respondents must \nfollow removal procedures pursuant to the plain language of Section 1229a of the INA to determine \nwhether such individual may be removed.  While in removal proceedings under Title 8, these AEA \ndesignees will have access to apply to all relief protections afforded under Title 8 and applicable \nregulations.  \n  If an AEA designee has not been previously admitted, Respondents retain the discretion as \nto the precise procedures to follow, but must, as a matter of law, afford a designee the opportunity \nto apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief, and have their claims adjudicated in \naccordance with existing law.  In sum, this framework in no way prohibits Respondents from \nremoving individuals under independent provisions of Title 8.  \n4.  The INA does not restrict this Court from enjoining AEA designees’ transfer out of \nthe Western District of Texas.  \n  In her Petition, Petitioner prays this Court to “[e]njoin Respondents from transferring \nPetitioner and the class out of this district during the pendency of this litigation without advance \nnotice to counsel.” Pet. 27, ECF No. 1.  Respondents allege that “the INA bars this Court from \nentering injunctive relief with respect to transfers in three different ways.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. \n \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 49 of 56\n     \n \n12, ECF No. 39.  First, the Executive has “great discretion in deciding where to detain petitioners” \nand that decision cannot be reviewed per Title 8 Sections 1231(g)(1) and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Id.  \nNext, they assert that Title 8 Section 1252(g) “prohibits district courts from hearing challenges to \ndecisions and actions about whether, when, and where to commence removal proceedings.” Id. at \n13.  Finally, Respondents argue this Court cannot prevent Respondents from transferring any class \nmember, “not named in this action on an individual basis, to a place of its discretion under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(g).” Id.   \nRespondents are incorrect in their reading of the INA.  The sections Respondents cite to do \nnot support their claims that this Court lacks jurisdiction to prevent transfer of Petitioner and her \nclass members. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); see also Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 247 \n(2010)  (applying  only  to  decisions  where  Congress  has  “set  out  the  Attorney  General’s \ndiscretionary authority in the statute.”).  Further, because a plain reading of Section 1231(g) does \nnot address transfers, its inclusion in Respondents’ reasoning is, likewise, inconsequential.  \nFinally, the Court agrees with Petitioner that the All Writs Act permits a court to “enjoin \nalmost any conduct ‘which left unchecked, would have . . . the practical effect of diminishing the \ncourt’s power to bring the litigation to a natural conclusion.’”  Reply to Mot. 10, ECF No. 44 \n(citing to Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 1092, 1102 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation \nomitted)).  As such, the Court has the jurisdiction to enjoin Respondents from transferring \nPetitioner and certified class members out of the Western District of Texas during the pendency of \ntheir habeas proceedings.  \n \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 50 of 56\n     \n \n5.  The equitable factors weigh in favor of an injunction. \n  This Court is tasked with determining whether the equitable factors and public interest-\nrelated factors present in this case weigh in favor of an injunction.  To succeed, Petitioner must \nestablish that she is 1) likely to succeed on the merits, 2) likely to suffer irreparable harm absent \nan injunction, 3) that the balance of equities tips in her favor, and 4) that an injunction is in the \npublic interest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Because this Court \nconsolidated the hearing with the trial on the merits43 and addressed all claims as a matter of law \nunder the summary judgment standard, the first element is met.  As such, the Court will only \naddress the final three factors.  \nPetitioner argues that “the balance of hardships overwhelmingly favors Petitioner.” Pet’r’s \nMem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 30, ECF No. 34-1 (citing to Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n(2009)).  She claims that the public has an interest not only in preventing the wrongful removal of \nindividuals to places where they will face persecution and torture, id., but also believes there is “a \nsubstantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern \ntheir existence and operations.” Id. (citing to League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016)).  She alleges that Respondents cannot make a similar argument as to what harms \nthey would suffer if an injunction were granted because there is no contesting “Respondents’ \nability to prosecute criminal offenses, detain noncitizens, and remove noncitizens under the \nimmigration laws.” Id. at 30–31 (internal citations omitted).   \n \n43 See Order Consol., ECF No. 37. \n \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 51 of 56\n     \n \n  Respondents,  on  the  other  hand,  claim  the  equitable  factors  “weigh  strongly  in  the \ngovernment’s favor.” Resp’ts’ Opp’n to Mot. 27, ECF No. 39.  Respondents argue “Petitioner \nfailed to show that she will suffer irreparable harm” and the public interest favors denial of \npreliminary injunctive relief. Id. at 28.  In support of their claims, Respondents parrot their \nprevious arguments that Petitioner has received due process, and that she has not “made a showing \nof likely irreparable harm from ‘harsh and life threatening’ conditions if removed” to El Salvador.  \nId. (internal citation omitted).  Respondents continue to tout their policy “not to remove aliens to \ncountries where they are likely to be tortured.” Id.  Finally, Respondents argue that “[a]n injunction \neffectively usurps the President’s statutory and constitutional authority to address a terrorist gang \nthat is engaging in an invasion,” id. at 28–29, and claim that because an injunction would \n“imped[e] the Executive’s ability to swiftly remove aliens with no right to remain in the United \nStates who are identified as alien enemies due to their gang activity” this would ultimately harm \nthe public. Id. at 29.  \n  The stakes in this case, and others like it, could not be higher.  Respondents have removed \nhundreds of individuals, some based on allegedly “flimsy to nonexistent evidence” such as “tattoos \nand social media postings,” see Mot., Ex. 8, ECF No. 34-10, to El Salvador's Center for Terrorism \nConfinement (“CECOT”).  CECOT has “a troubling history of violating human rights and where \nmen sleep hundreds to a cell on steel beds with no mattresses or pillows.” Mot., Ex. 7, ECF No. \n34-10.  In a 2023 report, even the Department of State emphasized CECOT’s “[p]rison conditions \n. . . were harsh and life threatening,” and testimonies from released prisoners show “systemic abuse \n \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 52 of 56\n     \n \nin the prison system, including beatings by guards and the use of electric shocks44.” Decl. of Dr. \nSarah C. Bishop, Mot. Ex. D, ECF No. 34-6. \n  It is unclear at best, and unlikely at worst, whether individuals removed to El Salvador \nunder Proclamation 10903 will ever be released from prison.  Further, Respondents take the \nposition that, even when they make a mistake, they cannot retrieve individuals from the Salvadoran \nprisons  to  which  it  has  sent  them.  See  Defendant's  Memo.  of  Law  in  Opp’n \nin Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25–CV–951 (D. Md., Mar. 31, 2025), ECF Doc. 11, at 7–9; see \nalso  J.G.G.,  145  S.  Ct.  at  1010—11  (Sotomayor,  J.,  dissenting)  (“[t]he  implication  of  the \nGovernment's position is that not only noncitizens but also United States citizens could be taken \noff the streets, forced onto planes, and confined to foreign prisons with no opportunity for redress \nif judicial review is denied unlawfully before removal. History is no stranger to such lawless \nregimes, but this Nation's system of laws is designed to prevent, not enable, their rise.”). \n  Fortunately, this Court does not have to make this decision in a vacuum.  The Supreme \nCourt has also agreed that individuals in Petitioner’s position have a high risk of severe irreparable \nharm. See generally A.A.R.P., 145 S. Ct. at 1367 (“the District Court's inaction—not for 42 minutes \nbut for 14 hours and 28 minutes—had the practical effect of refusing an injunction to detainees \nfacing an imminent threat of severe, irreparable harm.”); see also J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1010-11 \n(Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (“Deportation directly into CECOT presented a risk of extraordinary \nharm to these Plaintiffs.”).  In the same vein, the balance of the equities tip in Petitioner’s favor \n \n44 Other forms of abuse highlighted by the State Department include “suffocation, burning, and \nmock executions against children” as well as “beatings and water boarding.” Id. \n \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 53 of 56\n     \n \nand an injunction is in the public interest.  Based on the evidence put forth by Petitioners, the Court \nfinds Petitioner has met her burden, and the equitable factors weigh in favor of granting an \ninjunction. \nCONCLUSION \nIt is an established principle in our nation that no one is above the law. Prominent rhetoric \nsurrounding immigration calls for noncitizens to follow the law in their attempts to enter the United \nStates.  The same principle applies to our government.  The government, too, must follow the law \nwhen effectuating removals from the United States.  As explained by this Court, Proclamation \n10903 falls short.  \nFor the reasons stated above, this Court determines declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, \nand a writ of habeas corpus is proper.  Petitioner has standing to bring these claims, and all of \nPetitioners claims are justiciable.  Proclamation 10903 is unlawful because it fails to satisfy the \nstatutory preconditions required to allow any president to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. \n§  21.    Proclamation  10903  is  further  unlawful  because  it  fails  to  comport  with  the  Fifth \nAmendment’s Due Process Clause and because it bars any application of the Immigration and \nNationality Act, Title 8 of the United States Code, with respect to noncitizens admitted to the \nUnited States and to humanitarian relief from removal as established by Congress.  \n Lastly, because this Court finds there are no genuine issues of material fact and treats \nPetitioner’s motion for a preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment, the Court \nissues permanent injunctive relief.  \n \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00171-DB     Document 59     Filed 06/09/25     Page 54 of 56\n     \n \nAccordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED Petitioner M.A.P.S.’, on her own behalf and as \nrepresentative of the certified class, “Class Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Complaint for \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief,” ECF No. 1, is GRANTED. \nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  Petitioner  M.A.P.S.’,  on  her  own  behalf  and  as \nrepresentative of the certified class, “Motion for Preliminary Injunction,” ECF No. 34, is construed \nas a motion for a summary judgment and is GRANTED.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED President Donald J.
