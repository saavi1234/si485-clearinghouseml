    "summary": "<p>This case challenges the alleged illegal termination of grant money for state and jurisdictional humanities councils by the United States DOGE Service.</p>\r\n<p>The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) was established by Congress in 1965 with the declaration that \"The arts and the humanities belong to all the people of the United States\". The goal was to provide funding for research, publication of scholarly works, and the promotion of the humanities. Congress also created a statutory framework to protect the agency from political influence. In 1972, Congress amended the NEH statutes to create grants-in-aid programs for each state and territory, which led to the funding of state and jurisdictional humanities councils. The Federation of State Humanities Councils, founded in 1977, is a non-profit organization that includes almost all of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities councils as members. The Federation's mission is to advocate for increased investment in and engagement with this national network, and to support and amplify the work of its members. An example is the Oregon Council for the Humanities (Oregon Humanities), a non-profit corporation created in 1971 to distribute NEH funds for public humanities projects throughout Oregon.</p>\r\n<p>Executive Order 14158, signed on January 20, 2025, by President Trump, created the \"United States DOGE Service\" (DOGE) as part of the Executive Office of the President. Following the order, the chair of the NEH was directed to resign in March 2025, and the NEH was allegedly instructed to review grants issued since 2021 for potential violations of new executive orders. This review allegedly resulted in the termination of nearly all grants to state and jurisdictional councils in March and April 2025, halting their operations and prompting the filing of this lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On May 15, 2025, the Oregon Council for the Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against DOGE and its Acting Administrator, the NEH and its Acting Chairman, and the National Council on the Humanities. They argued that the termination of the grants violated the National Council on the Humanities' grant statute, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Separation of Powers, and exceeded DOGE's legal authority. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought an order directing the NEH to follow proper procedures for grant applications and funding, to continue providing funds appropriated by Congress to the Federation's members, and to set aside the unlawful termination of grants. The case was assigned to Judge Michael Howard Simon.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that DOGE illegally &ldquo;gutted the NEH and terminated almost all grants issued to the state and jurisdictional councils&rdquo; without reasoned analysis or proper notice and opportunity to appeal as required by law. They argued that these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Separation of Powers, as Congress, not the President, has the power to create agencies and direct how federal funds are spent. The plaintiffs claimed that the NEH could not refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress and that the delays and grant terminations caused &ldquo;irreparable harm&rdquo; to the Federation and its members, including councils terminating staff, canceling events, and risking permanent closure due to the loss of millions of dollars in already-awarded funding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 11, 2025, underscoring the central role of federal grants in their work and including a table of congressional appropriations through 2024 to demonstrate Congress&rsquo;s ongoing support for the program. The amended complaint also added a new section addressing NEH&rsquo;s purported &ldquo;rescission&rdquo; on June 2 of the 2025 grant terminations, contending that the rescission letters were largely boilerplate, lacked individualized analysis, and still resulted in significant funding cuts while maintaining the rescission of other types of grants. Finally, the amended complaint introduced a new claim for relief under the Impoundment Control Act and the Appropriations Clause, asserting that the grant terminations were ultra vires.</p>\r\n<p>On June 25, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that they were likely to succeed on the merits. They also claimed that they would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction, citing the need for councils to terminate staff, cancel events, and face potential permanent closure. They also argued that the balance of equities and public interest favored the injunction, as it would prevent unlawful agency action and protect the humanities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 7, 2025, the states of Oregon, Maryland, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai&lsquo;i, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Vermont, and the District of Columbia filed a brief supporting the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction, citing unlawful termination of NEH grants to their humanities councils. The brief emphasized the cultural and legal interests at stake, the councils&rsquo; close ties to state governments, and argued the court had jurisdiction because the claims rested on statutory and constitutional grounds, not contract law, making the Tucker Act inapplicable. It supported the plaintiffs&rsquo; showing of likely success, irreparable harm, and a public interest in preserving funding, noting specific harms such as program pauses and potential cancellation of the nation&rsquo;s 250th anniversary celebrations.</p>\r\n<p>On August 6, 2025, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, specifically citing violations of the Separation of Powers doctrine, the Impoundment Control Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. 2025 WL 2237478. The court rejected the defendants' argument that they had the discretion to terminate grants, emphasizing that the Executive Branch cannot refuse to spend congressionally appropriated funds. Furthermore, the court agreed that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction and that the public interest favored the injunction to prevent unlawful agency action and to protect the humanities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of October 15, 2025, the defendants have filed their answer to plaintiffs' amended complaint, and have not yet filed motions regarding the preliminary injunction</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case is about DOGE allegedly illegally ending grants for state and regional humanities councils. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) was created to support arts and humanities programs across the country. Over time, Congress set up a system where NEH money was sent out to individual state and territory councils. These councils use the funds for local projects, like the Oregon Council for the Humanities.\r\n\r\nAfter President Trump signed Executive Order 14158 in January 2025, the NEH was reportedly told to review and possibly cancel many grants made since 2021. As a result, almost all grants to state and jurisdictional humanities councils were cut in March and April 2025. This sudden move forced councils to lay off staff, cancel events, and even risk closing down.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 2025, the Oregon Council for the Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils filed a lawsuit in federal court against DOGE, NEH, and other officials. They argued these actions broke the law, went against Congressional rules, and caused serious harm to their organizations. The plaintiffs asked the court to stop the cuts and require the NEH to continue funding the councils.\r\n\r\nMany states joined in support, saying the grant cuts were unfair and hurt important cultural programs. On August 6, 2025, the judge agreed there was likely a legal violation and blocked the government from ending the grants while the case continues.\r\n\r\nAs of October 15, 2025, the case is still ongoing.",

These actions were unlawful and irreparably harmed the \ncritical humanities infrastructure Congress intentionally formed more than sixty years ago when \nit created NEH and declared in the enabling legislation that, “the humanities belong to all the \npeople of the United States.”  Among other things, Defendants choked off support for the \nFederal State Partnership and thereby interfered with and significantly harmed the delivery of \nhumanities programming throughout the country. \nFollowing the filing of Plaintiffs’ Complaint in May 2025, NEH tried to mask its blatant \nviolations of federal statutes by issuing partial “recission” notices to the Councils.  But, as \npleaded in the Amended Complaint filed June 11, 2025, these notices only served to confirm the \nagency’s continuing violation of law.  Indeed, NEH communicated that the partial recissions \n“still represent[ed] an incredible hardship” to the Federal State Partnership. \nThe grant terminations and partial recissions are unlawful many times over.  Under the \nConstitution’s separation of powers, the Executive may not refuse to spend funds appropriated \nby Congress.  Defendants have done just that by rescinding approved grants stemming from \n$130 million in appropriated funds and flouting the direction of Congress to distribute a specified \nportion of the agency’s most recent appropriation to the Councils in the Federal State \nPartnership.  This is also a violation of the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which was passed to \nassure that “the practice of reserving funds does not become a vehicle for furthering \nPAGE 1 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 8 of 37\nAdministration policies and priorities at the expense of those decided by Congress.” See S. Rep. \nNo. 93-688 at 75 (1974). In the effort to dismantle the Federal State Partnership, Defendants also \nviolated a host of statutory mandates, including the requirement that NEH apply a specific \nstatutory formula to funds appropriated by Congress; the requirement that NEH provide notice \nand an opportunity to be heard before modifying approved grant funding; and the requirement of \nproviding the Councils with a means for appeal.  Defendants have thereby violated the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. \nGiven the clear lawlessness of Defendants’ actions, the irreparable harm to the Plaintiffs, \nand the public interest in preserving humanities work across the Nation, Plaintiffs request a stay \npursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705 and a preliminary injunction to prevent further destruction of the \nFederal State Partnership and harm to the state and jurisdictional humanities councils and the \npublic. \nFACTUAL AND STATUTORY BACKGROUND \nI.  NEH History and the Federal State Partnership \nCongress created NEH nearly sixty years ago through the National Foundation on the \nArts and Humanities Act of 1965.  Pub. L. 89-209, 79 Stat. 845 (Sept. 29, 1965) (codified at 20 \nU.S.C. §§ 951-60).  In establishing NEH, Congress found that “[i]t is necessary and appropriate \nfor the Federal Government to complement, assist, and add to programs for the advancement of \nthe humanities and the arts by local, State, regional, and private agencies and their \norganizations.” Id. § 951(5). Congress declared that the Federal government has a key role in \n“help[ing] create and sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, \nand inquiry but also the material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent.” Id. \n§ 951(7). \nTo facilitate distribution of humanities support in every state and jurisdiction of the \nUnited States, Congress established the Councils. 20 U.S.C. § 956(f).  The Councils act as a \ncrucial bridge between the federal government and widely dispersed local communities \nthroughout the United States by acting as a conduit and steward of NEH funding. \nPAGE 2 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 9 of 37\nSpecifically, the NEH statutes provide that the states and jurisdictions of the United \nStates shall receive NEH funding by establishing grant recipient organizations with up to 25% of \n1\nboard members appointed by an officer or agency of such state. See 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(2)(B).   \nPursuant to this provision, each of the states and territories whose humanities Councils are \ninvolved in this litigation have formed Section 501(c)(3) nonprofit state humanities councils, \nwhich together constitute the membership of Plaintiff Federation of State Humanities Councils \n(“Federation”).  Throughout this brief, we refer to the statutory relationship between the NEH \nand the state and jurisdictional humanities councils as the “Federal State Partnership.” \nFor example, in 1971, Oregon created Oregon Humanities as a Section 501(c)(3) \norganization to distribute NEH funds to public humanities projects in communities all over \nOregon. (Davis Decl.  ¶ 3.)  The Governor of Oregon appoints up to 25% of the members to \nOregon Humanities’ board of directors. Id. As such, Oregon Humanities is funded by the NEH \nunder 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(2)(B).  Each of the other states and jurisdictions of the United States \nalso has a 501(c)(3) humanities council, and all but one council is a member of the Federation. \nIn Oregon, NEH dollars flowing through Oregon Humanities help fund humanities \nprogramming in every corner of the state—including grants for rural libraries in communities \nsuch as Burns, Joseph, Blue River, Newport, and Forest Grove; program funding for youth-led \nconversations about mental health in Medford and storytelling projects led by Nez Perce \nWallowa Homeland; fellowships for emerging storytellers from Woodburn, Silverton, Seal \nRock, Talent, and Cove; the publication of a widely-distributed Oregon Humanities magazine \nfeaturing stories from all over the state; the production of two audio programs, The Detour and \nThis Place, that air on eight community radio stations and on podcast streaming platforms; \ncommunity conversation programs held in libraries, cultural centers, and community colleges \n \n1\n The statutes also provide that states may receive NEH funding through a state agency, id. \n§ 956(f)(2)(A), but all the Councils were formed under section 956(f)(2)(B). \nPAGE 3 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 10 of 37\nthat generate healthy discourse, build trust and relationships across differences of background \nand belief, and encourage engaged and active civic participation. (Davis Decl. ¶ 9.) \nThis Congressionally-directed flow of federal NEH dollars is repeated throughout the \nstates and jurisdictions of the United States.  NEH funds reach Councils in each state and \njurisdiction, and those Councils deliver direct humanities programming and issue grants to local \ngrassroots humanities projects in every county and locality in the country.  From Mississippi to \nSouth Dakota, Maine to California, the Northern Mariana Islands to Idaho, and places in \nbetween, NEH funding flows to the Councils who in turn support a multitude of community-\nbased public humanities programs throughout the Nation. (See, e.g., Asmo Decl; Best Decl.; \nDavis Decl.; Johnson Decl.; Lyon Decl.; Oey Decl; Perez-Verdia Decl.; Rockoff Decl.; Stein \nDecl.)  The local communities choose the humanities programming best suited for their area—by \ndesign, the content of humanities work funded by NEH is therefore not top-down but rather \ninherently local. \nThe several declarations supporting this Motion address only the tip of the iceberg in \nterms of impact of NEH funding in our country.  In Ohio, for example, Ohio Humanities Council \nis the only statewide grant maker in the state that exclusively funds the public humanities and has \nan open and public application process. (Asmo Decl. ¶ 4.)  Ohio, the seventh most populous state \nin the nation, is one of only 10 states where the state legislature does not support its state \nhumanities council.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  This means that for many communities – especially underserved \nregions like Appalachia—NEH funding that flows through the council is one of the only \nguaranteed sources of funding to support the preservation and amplification of cultural assets and \nstories. (Id.) \nIn Alaska, home to members of 229 federally recognized tribes and speakers of 20 \ndistinct Alaska Native languages, many of which are endangered, NEH funding supported \nlanguage preservation efforts. (Perez-Verdia Decl. ¶ 8.)  The Eyak language, for example, lost its \nlast fluent speaker in 2008.  Some remaining languages have fewer than 40 fluent speakers. \nPAGE 4 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 11 of 37\nEfforts by Alaska Humanities Forum included youth-led language programs designed to ensure \nthese languages—and the histories and cultures they carry—are not lost.  (Id.) \nWhile relative to the federal budget the dollars are miniscule, the impact of NEH funding \nflowing through the Councils to communities throughout the nation is enormous. \nII.  NEH Structure and Funding of State and Jurisdictional Humanities Councils \nTo effectuate Congress’s directive that the NEH fund the Councils, the NEH had until \nrecently maintained a robust organizational structure consisting of around 180 staff members and \nnumerous program offices and divisions. (Sortun Decl. Ex. A “NEH Annual Report” at 6-8.) \nNEH maintained a program office to administer specific grant programs and related activities \nthrough the Federal State Partnership called the Office of Federal/State Partnership. This office \nperformed work critical to meeting NEH’s statutory mandates. See NEH Annual Report at 7-8.  \nUntil recently, the Office of Federal/State Partnership employed six people including a director, \nan assistant director, two senior program directors, and two program managers.  (Mary Doe Decl. \n¶ 7.)  These staff members worked closely with the Councils by conducting site visits, \ncoordinating grant applications, and generally supporting the longstanding partnership between \nthe NEH and the states. Id. \nCongress has consistently funded the NEH generally and the Federal State Partnership \nspecifically through annual appropriations since its founding. In the 2024 Appropriations Act, \nCongress appropriated $207,000,000 to NEH, “of which $192,000,000 shall be available for \nsupport of activities in the humanities, pursuant to section [20 U.S.C. § 956(c)] of the Act and for \nadministering the functions of the Act.” Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 281 (Mar. 9, 2024) (the \n“2024 Appropriations Act”).  As such, $192,000,000 was designated for final awards to further \nthe enumerated purposes under § 956(c), as well as administrative support. 2024 Appropriations \nAct at 281–82.  Of that $192,000,000, $65,000,000 was designated for the Federal State \nPartnership.  (Sortun Decl. Ex. F p. 8, Ex. E p. 4.) The President signed the appropriations bill. \nOn March 15, 2025, Congress enacted a continuing resolution that re-appropriated all the \nfunds appropriated to NEH in 2024, with the same breakdown in designated expenditures. \nPAGE 5 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 12 of 37\nPub. L. 119-4, §§ 1101-08, 139 Stat. 9, 10-12 (Mar. 15, 2025) (the “2025 Continuing \nResolution”).  NEH thus received an additional $207,000,000, including an additional $192 \nmillion for grants and other assistance programs under § 956(c), with $65,000,000 earmarked for \nthe Federal State Partnership.  (Sortun Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. E.)  The President signed the CR. \nNEH has for decades funded the Councils.  NEH funding for the Councils is mandatory \nand has historically constituted the largest portion of the Congressional appropriations for the \nagency. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4); (Sortun Decl. ¶ 9, Exs. E & F.).  Even NEH’s website \ndescribes it as such: “[b]y congressional mandate, [NEH] provides general operating support \nawards to support public humanities programming in the 56 states and jurisdictions. Fed/State \nworks with the designated humanities councils in each state and jurisdiction.  The councils are \nFed/State’s sole awardees.”2 \nTo be eligible for receipt of NEH funds, each state or Council must first “submit an \napplication for such assistance at such time as shall be specified by the Chairperson [of NEH].  \nEach such application shall be accompanied by a plan” that sets out certain requirements.  \n20 U.S.C. § 956 (f)(3).  All the Councils had 2025 plans approved by the NEH Chairperson as of \nthe time of filing this litigation.  (Stein Decl. ¶ 4.) \nThe statutes provide a mandatory formula for allocating the funding specified for the \nFederal State Partnership among the Councils with approved plans once the money is \nappropriated by Congress.  For one example, 44% “of [certain fiscal year appropriations] shall \nbe allotted in equal amounts among the States and grant recipients which have plans approved by \nthe Chairperson [of NEH]” and 22% “of [certain fiscal year appropriations] shall be allotted \n[based upon population of] the States and grant recipients which have plans approved by the \nChairperson [of NEH].”  20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4)(B)–(C). \n \n2\n National Endowment for the Humanities: Office of Federal/State Partnership, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/divisions/fedstate (last visited June 10, 2025) (emphasis added). \nPAGE 6 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 13 of 37\nCouncils are informed of their portion of the appropriated funds through a Notice of \nAction from NEH, described in more detail below. \nIII.  State and Jurisdictional Humanities Councils Rely Upon Mandatory NEH Support \nThe Councils were established as state grant recipients to steward NEH funds intended \nfor distribution throughout the country.  The infrastructure of the Federal State Partnership \npresupposes that the Councils depend heavily on NEH funding to deliver creative, intellectually \nstimulating, and emotionally vibrant humanities programming for all Americans. At any given \ntime, Councils may have multiple open NEH grants that support their operations and fund \nhumanities programming, including through grantmaking to local humanities organizations. \n(Stein Decl. ¶ 8–9.) \nCouncils apply to NEH for general operating support grants (often referred to as “GOS \ngrants”) in response to an NEH Notice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”).  The NOFO for each \nFiscal Year Congressional appropriation outlines the steps that Councils must take to request a \ngeneral operating support grant. Id. \nOnce Councils submit application materials to the NEH, they await award decisions, \nwhich are announced via a system called eGMS. Award decisions, called Notices of Action, set \nout the amount of funds awarded to the Council for the general operating support grant.  The \namount of money in the pool to make award decisions is governed by Congressional \nappropriations and determined by Congressional instruction. \nCouncils receive the NEH general operating support grant funding in one of two ways. \nThey may ask for funds in advance for a particular expense.  The majority of funds, however, are \nreimbursements.  Councils pay expenses directly, then seek reimbursement through eGMS under \nthe relevant operating grant.  Until April 2, 2025, the NEH routinely and rapidly reimbursed \nCouncils for these expenses (generally within five to seven business days) as the outlay of \nmoney had already been approved by the NEH. \nIn addition to general operating support grants, Councils may apply for and receive grant \nfunding by applying for special initiative funding offered by NEH. Special initiative grants are \nPAGE 7 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 14 of 37\n“non-competitive grants” set aside specifically for the Councils.  In other words, when the NEH \nChairperson identifies an issue of importance for which the Councils are uniquely situated to \nassist NEH, the NEH Chairperson calls upon the Councils for their help.  Two recent examples \nof Special Initiative grants are the Chair’s Grants to respond to climate disasters hitting \ncommunities throughout the United States and the United We Stand effort to mitigate the \ndevastation of hate-fueled violence impacting our Nation. Councils also may apply for (and do \nreceive) grants through various NEH competitive grants open to the general public. \nIV.  The Decision to Dismantle NEH and Disrupt the Federal State Partnership \nOn January 20, 2025, the President established DOGE as a new component of the \nExecutive Office of the President. E.O. 14158 § 3(a) (Jan. 20, 2025).  The Executive Order \nrequired agencies to work with a “DOGE Team Lead” who would “advise” the agency “on \nimplementing the President’s DOGE Agenda.” Id. § 3(c).  In a subsequent Executive Order, the \nPresident directed agencies to work with DOGE to “terminate or modify . . . contracts and grants \nto reduce overall Federal spending or reallocate spending to promote efficiency and advance the \npolicies of my Administration.” E.O. 14222 § 3(b) (Feb. 26, 2025). \nIn March 2025, shortly after the White House terminated NEH Chair Shelly Lowe, two \noperatives from DOGE arrived at NEH. (Jane Doe Decl. ¶ 8.3)  DOGE met with senior NEH \nleadership to discuss DOGE’s plans for NEH’s future. (Jane Doe Decl. ¶ 12.)  On April 1, 2025, \nActing Chairman of the NEH, Defendant McDonald, told NEH staff that DOGE sought to “claw \nback” $175 million in grants. (Id.) \nOn April 9, NEH staff received a notice alerting them to an upcoming “multi-step \napproach to restructuring” that promised to include a Reduction in Force (“RIF”). (Id. ¶ 18 & \nEx. BB.)  The next day, 65-70% of NEH staff members received RIF notifications that they \n \n3\n See also Jennifer Schuessler, DOGE Demands Deep Cuts at Humanities Endowment, N.Y. \nTIMES (Apr. 1, 2025), https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/arts/trump-doge-federal-cuts-\nhumanities.html. \nPAGE 8 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 15 of 37\nwould be terminated as of June 10, 2025. (Id. ¶ 19.)  Every NEH staff person working in the \nOffice of Federal/State Partnership was terminated by early June. (Stein Decl. ¶ 13; Mary Doe \nDecl. ¶ 7.) \nV.  Termination of General Operating Support and Other NEH Grant Funding to State \nand Jurisdictional Humanities Councils \nOn April 2, following Defendant McDonald’s statement that DOGE intended to “claw \nback” $175 million in grant funding, DOGE emailed nearly 1,500 grantees informing the \ngrantees that their grants were being terminated.  This included all the open general operating \nsupport grants, all the open special initiative grants, and the open Chair’s grants, as well all open \ncompetitive grants of the Councils. (Stein Decl. ¶ 13;) \nDOGE did not process the grant terminations through NEH’s grants management system \nand the termination notification to grantees did not come from an NEH email address, but rather \nfrom Grant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com. (Jane Doe Decl. ¶ 14; Davis Decl. \nEx. ¶ 11.) The emails attached a grant termination letter purportedly signed by Acting Director of \nNEH Michael McDonald.  However, the termination letters were not hand-signed by McDonald \nor digitally signed with a verifiable digital signature.  Instead, the signature was typed by \nsomeone as “/s/ Michael McDonald.” Id. \nThe terminations were nearly identical, without any specific information about the grants \nor any information regarding how to appeal. (See, e.g., Stein Decl. Ex. A; Davis Decl. Ex. A.)  \nAs justification, the termination notices claimed that Executive Order 14217 required that NEH \neliminate non-statutorily-required activities and functions (Id.); however, Executive Order 14217 \ndid not name NEH. \nOn April 30, the Councils and the Federation received an email from the NEH Office of \nGrant Management. (Davis Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. B.)  The email stated that NEH terminated awards in \n2025 and attached a document called “Guidance for Recipients of Terminated NEH Awards.”  \nThe guidance provided a process for Councils to submit for “termination costs” associated with \nPAGE 9 –  MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 16 of 37\nterminated grants.  The guidance stated that “NEH is not offering a means of dispute resolution” \nor appeal for terminated grants. (Id.) \nVI.  June “Recission” Notices \nThe April 2 termination notices and April 30 guidance received by each Council threw \nthe Councils into disarray.  The Federation heard immediately from its members multiple times a \nday regarding their damaged relationships with community partners, expenses incurred which \nNEH abruptly refused to reimburse, financial struggles, and fears about the future of humanities \nprogramming in their respective states. (Stein Decl. ¶ 14.) \nThe Complaint in this litigation was filed May 15, 2025.  On June 2, NEH contacted the \nCouncils via email. (Stein Decl. ¶ 18; Davis Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. C.)  The email, titled “FY25 GOS \nAwards: termination has been rescinded up to 20 percent” stated, “NEH has rescinded the \ntermination of the fiscal year 2025 General Operating Support (GOS) grants.  For fiscal year \n2025, the agency is funding the humanities Councils at 20 percent of its appropriation of \nprogram funds, which is the minimum that NEH is congressionally mandated to award to our \nstate and jurisdictional humanities council partners. …  I realize the reduction in funds from 40 \npercent to 20 percent still represents an incredible hardship.” (Davis Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. C.)  \nFollowing receipt of this email, the Councils began receiving letters from NEH concerning \ncertain of their general operating support grants. (See, e.g., Stein Decl. Ex. C.) \nTo reiterate the above process, at the time of the June 2 email from NEH, Councils had \nalready received Notices of Action for two portions of FY25 General Operating Support Awards \nsetting out approved funding under the 2024 Appropriations Act.  They had not yet (and still \nhave not) received Notices of Action for the final amount of funding appropriated by Congress in \nthe March 2025 Continuing Resolution. Moreover, the June communication was limited to Fiscal \nYear 2025 general operating support grants; it did not mention the other open council grants \nincluding the earlier year general operating support grants, open special initiative grants, open \nChair’s grants, or any open competitive grants of the Councils. Nor did the communication \naddress funds appropriated in the Continuing Resolution but held back by NEH. \nPAGE 10 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 17 of 37\nVII.  Federal Statutes and Regulations Provide a Process for Grant Termination and \nAlteration Including Notice, Hearing, and an Opportunity to Cure. \nFederal statutes provide that NEH grants to the Federation’s members, including their \ngrants for general operating support, may be terminated only if the Chairperson of the NEH finds \nthat certain conditions occur.  See 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  As a prerequisite to termination, the \nstatutes require a finding by the NEH Chairperson “after reasonable notice and opportunity for \nhearing.” 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  Such a prerequisite finding may be that a Council (1) “is not \ncomplying substantially with the provisions” of the state council subsection of the statutes, (2) \n“is not complying substantially with terms and conditions of its State plan or grant recipient \napplication approved under” the same subsection, or (3) “any funds granted to [a Council] have \nbeen diverted from the purposes for which they are allotted . . . .” Id. \nIf one of the above conditions occur, the statutes provide an opportunity to cure:  “[T]he \nChairperson shall immediately notify the Secretary of the Treasury and the [Council] with \nrespect to which such finding was made that no further grants will be made under this subsection \nto such [Council] until there is no longer a default or failure to comply or the diversion has been \ncorrected, or, if the compliance or correction is impossible, until such [Council] repays or \narranges the repayment of the Federal funds which have been improperly diverted or expended.” \nId. \nUniform Administrative Requirements in the federal regulations further provide that \ngrants may be terminated by a federal agency if the recipient “fails to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1).  Alternately, a grant may be \nterminated by the agency with the consent of the recipient where the two parties agree upon \ntermination conditions.  Id. § 200.340(a)(2).  Finally, a grant may be terminated by the agency \n“pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by \nlaw, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  Id. § 200.340 \n(a)(4). \nPAGE 11 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 18 of 37\nIf an agency terminates a grant prior to the end of the grant period “due to the recipient’s \nmaterial failure to comply with the terms and conditions,” the agency is required to follow a \nprocess including reporting the termination and other processes including providing the grant \nrecipient with opportunities to challenge the decision and appeal rights.  See id. § 200.340(c); \n§ 200.341–342. \nSignificantly, the regulations require an opportunity for objections and appeal. Id. \n§ 200.342 (“The Federal agency must maintain written procedures for processing objections, \nhearings, and appeals.  Upon initiating a remedy for noncompliance (for example . . . \ntermination), the Federal agency must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and \nprovide information challenging the action.  The Federal agency or pass-through entity must \ncomply with any requirements for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings to \nwhich the recipient or subrecipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the \naction involved.”) \nVIII.  The Federation and the Councils Are in Immediate Peril \nThe above actions by Defendants have caused and are continuing to cause direct harm to \nthe Federation and all its members including Oregon Humanities.  Plaintiffs have included a \nrepresentative sampling of harms in declarations from the heads of the Councils of Alaska, \nArkansas, Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, as well as the \nFederation itself.  Per the Executive Director of the Federation: \nIt is hard to overstate how impacted all of our member organizations \nare, as well as our members’ sub-grantees throughout the country.  \nFor example, I speak to humanities council leaders every day who \nhave seen their robust staff, partnerships, grantees, and programs \nevaporate due to the elimination of both operating and program \nsupport. Even councils who have not laid off senior staff have lost \nthose invaluable employees and their institutional knowledge and \nexpertise because they could not guarantee future employment. I \nhave seen the vibrant, effective coalition of humanities councils that \nI have devoted my 25-year career to shrink and falter. The true losers \nare the American people, who no longer have access to the resources \nthat councils bring to every corner of the nation—for free. \nPAGE 12 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 19 of 37\n(Stein Decl. ¶ 14.)  Councils have laid off staff, moved out of office space, damaged \nrelationships with community partners, incurred reputational harm, and generally have been \nunable to fulfill their missions as a result of Defendants’ actions.  It is less than clear that some of \nthe Councils will financially survive the coming months. (See Davis Decl. ¶ 15; Rockoff Decl. \n¶ 11; Best Decl. ¶ 10.)  Representative harms are described in more detail in the supporting \ndeclarations.  The table below demonstrates a small sampling of specific examples of Councils \nforced to pause, suspend, or terminate programming and promised support: \nCouncil  Impacted Locality  Harm \nAlaska Humanities  Statewide  Cancelled Kindling Conversations \nForum (Perez-Verdia  program, which supported veterans \nDecl.)  across Alaska through facilitated \ndialogue and community-based \nresource kits. \nArkansas Humanities  Fayetteville (pop. 101,000),  Cancelled contract in place with the \nCouncil (Best Decl.)  Dyess (pop. 322), Monticello  Smithsonian Museum on Main \n(pop. 8,100), Arkansas  Street program, to host the national \ntraveling exhibition Americans. \nIllinois Humanities  Rushville, Illinois,  Cancelled all but one \"Country and \nCouncil (Lyon Decl.)

NEH’s mixed messages, abrupt funding policy changes (with no advance \nnotice or opportunity for Councils to be heard or appeal), and closure or near-closure of the \nOffice of Federal/State Partnership have caused ongoing instability and uncertainty that \njeopardize the functioning of these non-profit organizations who, by design, are local partners of \nNEH.  By terminating funding for the Councils, the actions by NEH have, by extension, \ndamaged the Councils’ relationships with libraries, educators, historical societies, local \nmuseums, and stifled a myriad of humanities activities benefiting Americans in every state and \njurisdiction. (Stein Decl. ¶ 20) \nPAGE 14 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 21 of 37\nLEGAL STANDARDS \nA preliminary injunction is warranted when (1) a plaintiff is likely to succeed on the \nmerits; (2) a plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) \nthe balance of equities tips in plaintiffs’ favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest. \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20(2008). \n“Due to the urgency of obtaining a preliminary injunction at a point when there has been \nlimited factual development, the rules of evidence do not apply strictly to preliminary injunction \nproceedings.” Herb Reed Enters., LLC v. Fla. Ent. Mgmt., Inc., 736 F.3d 1239, 1250 n.5 (9th Cir. \n2013); see also Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1083 (9th Cir. 2009). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \na.  Defendants’ Actions Violate the Separation of Powers \nUnless enjoined, the hamstringing of the Office of Federal/State Partnership at NEH and \nrelated grant terminations and partial recissions will preclude NEH from disbursing its \nCongressionally appropriated funding to the Councils.  The deliberate decision to flout \nCongressional command and refuse to spend appropriated funds violates the constitutional \nseparation of powers. \nLike all administrative agencies, NEH is a “creature[] of statute.” See Nat’l Fed’n of \nIndep. Bus. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022).  By statute, Congress established NEH, 20 \nU.S.C. § 956, defined its officers, e.g., id. § 956(b), authorized programs for it to administer, e.g., \nid. § 956(c)(1)–(10), (d), authorized the creation of state and jurisdictional humanities councils to \nreceive NEH funds, id. § 956(f), defined mandated allocations of NEH funding to the councils, \nid., and implemented procedures the NEH must follow to alter approved grants, id. § 956(f)(7). \nBecause “[t]here is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, \nto amend, or to repeal statutes,” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998), the \nAdministration could not abolish NEH directly. Id. at 464 (“‘[R]epeal of statutes, no less than \nenactment, must conform with Art. I.’”) (quoting INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 954 (1983)) \nPAGE 15 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 22 of 37\n(Scalia, J., concurring in part).  Nor can it lawfully do so indirectly by withholding the agency’s \nfunds, terminating its programs, and eliminating most of its personnel. \nNEH’s budget, no less than its formal existence, is subject to Congress’s “plenary \ncontrol.” See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 500 (2010). \nIndeed, NEH may not “spend less than the full amount appropriated by Congress for a particular \nproject or program.” See In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \nJ.).  “[T]he President may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply \nbecause of policy objections.” Id. at 259.  This foundational separation-of-powers principle is \nembodied in the Appropriations Clause, which provides that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl.7. \nCongressional appropriation laws specify the amount that NEH must spend. In the 2024 \nAppropriations Act, Congress appropriated to NEH $192,000,000 which “shall be available for \nsupport of activities in the humanities, pursuant to section [20 U.S.C. § 956(c)] of the Act and for \nadministering the functions of the Act.” Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 281 (Mar. 9, 2024) (the \n“2024 Appropriations Act”).  Of that $192,000,000, $65,000,000 was designated for the \nCouncils.  (Sortun Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. E; ¶ 9, Ex. F.)  The March 15, 2025 continuing resolution re-\nappropriated all of the funds appropriated to NEH in 2024, meaning an additional $65 million \nwas earmarked for the Federal State Partnership. Pub. L. 119-4, §§ 1101-08, 139 Stat. 9, 10-12 \n(Mar. 15, 2025). \nDefendants’ decision to dismantle the Federal-State Partnership contravenes these \nappropriations laws and Congressional authority.  For example, Defendants ordered the \ntermination of General Operating Support and other grants that had been awarded as part of the \n$130 million Congress appropriated for the Federal State Partnership.  The supporting \nDeclarations indicate that each of the Councils were allocated appropriations by NEH, which \nwere then clawed back, discontinued, or paused. \nTo use Oregon Humanities as an example, it applied for and was approved for a general \noperating support grant that spans November 1, 2022, to October 31, 2027.  (Davis Decl. ¶ 6.)  \nPAGE 16 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 23 of 37\nAn NEH Notice of Action approved $2,579,205 in funding for this grant.  To date, NEH has \nawarded and reimbursed $2,029,271 in funds under this grant.  An additional $258,934 should be \navailable under this grant during Fiscal Year 2025.  In addition, Oregon Humanities’ funding \nshould have increased by an additional $578,000 based upon the Continued Resolution \nappropriation, bringing its total award for its operating grant to $3,140,000.  The CR Notice of \nAction was never provided. In response to a NOFO, Oregon Humanities submitted an \napplication for a new general operating support grant for November 1, 2025 to October 31, 2030.  \nThat grant application has not been processed by NEH.  Oregon Humanities also applied for \nfunding through a second round of NEH’s United We Stand special initiative grant and were \nnotified on January 22, 2025, that it was awarded $40,000 in grant funds.  Those funds have \nalready been expended by Oregon Humanities, but not reimbursed by NEH.  (Id. at ¶ 7-8.) \nIn sum, Defendants have refused to disburse funds in the manner required by Congress, \nviolating the separation of powers.  When this Administration has tried in recent months to \ndismantle other federal agencies by withholding appropriated funds, courts repeatedly and \ncorrectly enjoined such unconstitutional acts. See, e.g., Widakuswara v. Lake, — F.Supp. 3d —, \n2025 WL 945869, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2025) (granting TRO to prevent the termination of \nmuch of an agency and its grants, because the Administration “usurp[ed] Congress’s power of \nthe purse and its legislative supremacy” when it “with[eld] the funds statutorily appropriated to \nfully administer” the agency); RFE/RL, Inc. v. Lake, — F. Supp. 3d —, 2025 WL 1232863, at *8 \n(D.D.C. Apr. 29, 2025) (“When money has been appropriated by Congress, ‘the Executive has \nno residual constitutional power to refuse to spend these appropriations.’”) (quoting Guadamuz \nv. Ash, 368 F. Supp. 1233, 1243–44 (D.D.C. 1973)); Am. Library Ass’n v. Sonderling, — \nF. Supp. 3d —, 2025 WL 1262054, at *2 (D.D.C. May 1, 2025) (“The wholesale termination of \ngrants and services and the mass layoffs . . . contravenes Congress’s appropriation of almost \n$300 million to [the Institute of Museum and Library Services].”). \n“This case has serious implications for our constitutional structure. Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d \nat 266–67. “It is no overstatement to say that our constitutional system of separation of powers \nPAGE 17 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 24 of 37\nwould be significantly altered if [courts] were to allow executive . . . agencies to disregard \nfederal law in the manner” done by Defendants here. See id. at 267.  This Court should similarly \nhold here that Defendants’ dismantling of NEH likely violated the separation of powers. \nb.  Defendants’ Actions Violate the Impoundment Control Act \nSeparation of powers principles have been codified in the Impoundment Control Act, \nwhich provides that all funds appropriated by Congress “shall be made available for obligation” \nunless Congress itself has rescinded the appropriation, 2 U.S.C. § 683(b), and that “[n]o officer \nor employee of the United States may defer any budget authority” except in exceedingly narrow \ncircumstances, id. § 684(b)–(c). \nCongress passed the ICA in response to President Nixon’s refusal to spend funds on \nnumerous statutory programs.  As then-Judge Kavanaugh explained, under the ICA, if the \nPresident has policy reasons for wanting to spend less than the full amount appropriated by \nCongress for a particular project or program, the President “must propose the rescission of funds, \nand Congress then may decide whether to approve a rescission bill.” Aiken County, 725 F.3d at \n261 n.1; see also 2 U.S.C. § 683. \nSimilarly, under the ICA, the President may “defer” spending funds only in limited \ncircumstances.  The ICA defines a “deferral” to include any “withholding or delaying the \nobligation or expenditure of” funds, and “any other type of Executive action or inaction which \neffectively precludes the obligation or expenditure of” funds. 2 U.S.C. § 682(1).  When the \nExecutive Branch wishes to defer funds, it must send a message to Congress detailing the money \nto be deferred and the reasons for deferral.  There are only three permissible grounds for \ndeferrals. Id. § 684(b).  “Policy reasons,” including ensuring funds are spent in accord with the \nPresident’s policy preferences, are not a proper basis for deferrals. See GAO, Office of \nManagement and Budget—Withholding of Ukraine Security Assistance, B-331564, at 6 (Jan. 16, \n2020). (Sortun Decl. Ex. G.) \nOn June 16, 2025, the U.S. Government Accountability Office issued a relevant decision \nin the matter of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (“IMLS”), finding that the IMLS \nPAGE 18 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 25 of 37\nviolated the ICA by withholding funds that cannot be withheld when it terminated grants as a \nresult of President Trump’s Executive Order 14238.

GAO found that grants contemplated by the IMLS statute could not be \nwithheld because the funds were “‘allotted’ to states by a specific ‘formula.’” Id. at 11. Because \nthe IMLS statutes contained (1) an allotment formula, (2) elements of notice (“IMLS ‘shall’ \napprove compliant state plans, which remain in place for five years thus giving states notice of \nfuture cutoffs”); and (3) a clear spending mandate (the statute directed the agency “shall award” \ngrants in formula-specified amounts), the funds were “not eligible for deferral or rescission \nconsistent with ICA procedures [and] may not be withheld from obligation and expenditure \nunder the ICA.”  See id. at 12. \nThis case is markedly similar.  As with IMLS, the President did not send a message to \nCongress detailing the money to be deferred from NEH and the reasons for deferral.  Like IMLS, \nNEH drastically reduced its operations, id. at 5, terminated grants, id. at 9, and terminated staff, \nid. at 10. Like IMLS, NEH withheld grant funding “that cannot be withheld consistent with the \nICA’s fourth disclaimer prohibition for funds ‘required’ to be spent.” Id. at 11.  The NEH statues \ncontain an allotment formula, elements of notice, and a clear spending mandate.  The same \nconclusion GAO reached concerning IMLS funding should result. \nThe President has not followed the ICA’s required procedure for proposing a rescission \nor deferral of NEH’s appropriations.  Defendants’ actions likely will result in a rescission of \nmuch of the nearly $130 million that Congress has appropriated to the Councils at NEH over the \nlast two years.  At a minimum, Defendants’ actions unquestionably are unlawful deferrals of the \nspending of these funds.  There can be no reasonable dispute that the mass firing of staff and \ninterruption of the Federal State Partnership will “delay[] the obligation or expenditure of” \nappropriated funds.  See 2 U.S.C. § 682(1).  And Defendants have undertaken these actions for \npolicy reasons, leaving no doubt that these deferrals violate the ICA.  See Withholding of \nUkraine Security Assistance, (Sortun Decl. Ex. G at 6.) \nPAGE 19 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 26 of 37\nc.  Defendants’ Terminations and Recissions Violate the Administrative \nProcedures Act \ni.  The Grant Terminations and Partial Recissions Are Final Agency \nAction \nThe decisions to terminate NEH grants and the subsequent partial rescissions, and the \nmeasures taken to implement that decision, constitute “final agency action” reviewable under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). 5 U.S.C. § 704.  An action is “final” if it (1) \n“‘consummat[es]’ [] the agency’s decisionmaking process” and (2) determines “‘rights or \nobligations’” or imposes “‘legal consequences.’” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) \n(quoting Chi. & S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948)).  Here, \nDefendants consummated their decision-making by mass terminating grants in April, and then \nissuing partial rescissions of a select number of terminations in June, all without notice, \nopportunity for hearing, or appeal.  These decisions also carried legal consequences because they \neither terminated grants or significantly reduced their amounts by halving previous awards.  \nAccordingly, the decision to dismantle NEH is plainly final. See, e.g., New York v. Trump, 133 \nF.4th 51, 67–68 (1st Cir. 2025) (“broad, categorical freezes on obligated funds” were “discrete \nfinal agency actions”). \nFirst, that the grants were terminated en masse, with identical language, leaves no doubt \nthat the terminations were done pursuant to a final, categorical decision and thus consummated \nthe decision-making. See New York v. Trump, 133 F.4th at 68–69 (concluding that “numerous \nnotices and emails authored by Agency Defendants [ ] support[ed] the finding that their funding \nfreezes were categorical in nature,” and that the “pauses, freezes, and sudden terminations of \nobligated funds [ ] suggested that these actions were taken pursuant to such categorical \ndecisions,” distinguishing Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004)). \nSecond, Defendants made clear that the actions taken in furtherance of the decision to \nterminate were final and “not . . . merely tentative or interlocutory.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178.  \nAmong other things, Defendants stated that there would be NO appeal opportunities for the \nCouncils.  See Purpose Built Fams. Found., Inc. v. United States, 634 F. Supp. 3d 1118, 1124–25 \nPAGE 20 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 27 of 37\n(S.D. Fla. 2022) (“letter stat[ing] that the agency ha[d] decided to terminate . . . grants” was \n“final agency action” because it “ma[de] clear that legal consequences w[ould] follow from the \nletter” and “d[id] not state or even suggest that any further proceedings w[ould] take place prior \nto termination”), aff’d on other grounds, 95 F. 4th 1346 (11th Cir. 2024).  When NEH circulated \nguidance for terminated grants to the Councils, it stated that “NEH is not offering a means of \ndispute resolution” or appeal for terminated grants.”  (Davis Decl. Ex. B.)  Clearly, these \ndecisions carried legal consequences. \nThe June partial rescissions do not change this conclusion.  When NEH wrote to all \nCouncils on June 2 it stated that some grant terminations had “been rescinded up to 20%.” (Stein \nDec. Ex. B.)  The Councils then began receiving letters from NEH with confusing language that \nis at odds with Congressional appropriation language.  For example, Wyoming Humanities \nCouncil received a letter that states that it could “continue approved activities under [its Fiscal \nYear 2025 GOS grant.”  (Id. Ex. C.)  But the letter also stated that “[f]or fiscal year 2025, the \nagency is funding at a 20 percent allocation, which is the minimum that NEH is congressionally \nmandated to award to its state and jurisdictional humanities council partners,” citing 20 U.S.C. \n§ 960.  These June communications did not reference previously awarded Notices of Action, \nprovide for notice or an opportunity to be heard on grant terminations and modifications, or \nprovide for an appeal right.  In other words, the terminations of half of the grant funding \n4\nremained final and not subject to appeal.  \n \n4\n The 20% number in the June partial rescission notice is also contrary to Congress’s instruction. \nIn connection with the 2024 Appropriations Bill, Congress directed NEH to “continue to provide \nno less than 40% of its program funds to support the work of these councils and maintain the \nlongstanding collaborative relationship between NEH and these councils.”  118th Cong 1st \nSession House of Representatives Report 118-155. The Notices of Action delivered to the \nCouncils stemming from this appropriation appear to have used the 40% number. The partial \nrecissions effectively halved awards to the Councils without reference to the required statutory \nformulas. Moreover, even if 20 U.S.C. § 960(a)(1)(B) provided NEH with discretion to cut \nCongressional appropriations in half, contrary to instruction from Congress, the statute plainly \ndoes not allow the claw back of appropriated funds after Council plans have been approved by \n \n \nPAGE 21 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 28 of 37\nDefendants’ decisions to terminate and rescind are thus final and subject to APA review. \nSee Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 807 (2022) (“attempt[] to terminate” programming constituted \n“final agency action”). \nii.  The Grant Terminations and Partial Recissions are Contrary to Law \nIn their rush to “claw back” $175 million in promised funding, Defendants failed to abide \nby numerous federal laws.  Specifically, in contravention of statute, Defendants (a) failed to \nfollow the statutory process for grant terminations or modifications by, for example, failing to \nprovide the Councils with notice and an opportunity to be heard, 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7); (b) cut \nfunding required to be provided to the Councils on population and other formulaic bases, 20 \nU.S.C. § 956(f)(4); and (c) failed to provide appellate rights. See also 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1), \n(2), (4); 2 C.F.R. § 200.342.  Each violation is an independent basis for this Court to find there is \na likelihood of success on the merits. \nFirst, NEH statutes state that grants to the Federation’s members, including their grants \nfor general operating support, may be terminated only if the Chairperson of the NEH finds that \ncertain conditions occur.  See 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  As a prerequisite to termination, the \nstatutes require a finding by the NEH Chairperson “after reasonable notice and opportunity for \nhearing.” 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  Such a prerequisite finding may be that a Council (1) “is not \ncomplying substantially with the provisions” of the state council subsection of the statutes, (2) \n“is not complying substantially with terms and conditions of its State plan or grant recipient \napplication approved under” the same section, or (3) “any funds granted to [a Council] have been \ndiverted from the purposes for which they are allotted . . . .”  Id. \nNo such findings were made about any of the mass grant terminations that occurred on \nApril 2.  Even if a finding had been made, the statutes also provide an opportunity to cure, which \nalso did not occur:  “[T]he Chairperson shall immediately notify the Secretary of the Treasury \n \nthe Chairperson and NEH has issued Notices of Action, particularly without a lawful basis and \nwithout providing notice or opportunity to be heard. \nPAGE 22 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 29 of 37\nand the [Council] with respect to which such finding was made that no further grants will be \nmade under this subsection to such [Council] until there is no longer a default or failure to \ncomply or the diversion has been corrected, or, if the compliance or correction is impossible, \nuntil such [Council] repays or arranges the repayment of the Federal funds which have been \nimproperly diverted or expended.” Id. \nSecond, Defendants violated federal laws regarding the specific allocation of NEH funds \nto the Federal State Partnership.  As explained in Part I.a., supra, NEH may not “spend less than \nthe full amount appropriated by Congress for a particular project or program.”  Aiken Cnty., 725 \nF.3d at 261 n.1.  By statute, the allocation formulas for NEH are mandatory once the Chairperson \nhas approved a Council’s plan: “44 per centum of the amount of such excess for such fiscal year \nshall be allotted in equal amounts among the States and grant recipients which have plans \napproved by the Chairperson” and 22% “of [certain fiscal year appropriations] shall be allotted \n[based upon population of] the States and grant recipients which have plans approved by the \nChairperson [of NEH].”  See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4)(B)–(C). \nHere, each of the Councils had 2025 plans approved by the Chairperson at the time of the \nApril 2 terminations and the June partial recissions.  Such cuts necessarily reduced certain states \nand jurisdictional Councils’ formula funds well below the amount required to be allocated by \nstatute.  Defendants’ cuts thus violate Congress’s command to allocate specific amounts of \nformula funds to each Council. \nThird, NEH failed to provide any mechanism for appeal.  As stated above, NEH guidance \non terminated grants stated no appeal mechanism would be provided.  The June 2 partial \nrescission notices similarly did not provide an appeal right when NEH halved the \nCongressionally appropriated funds to the Councils. \nBecause the termination and rescission decisions violated these statutes, Plaintiffs are \nlikely to succeed on their APA claim.  See Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., No. 25-CV-\n698, 2025 WL 842360, at *9 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025) (“[A]gencies can decide to re-evaluate their \nprograms, or they may decide to end agreements or federal awards.  But those decisions must be \nPAGE 23 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 30 of 37\nmade lawfully and in accordance with established procedures and relevant rules and \nregulations . . . .”). \niii.  Defendants’ Actions are Arbitrary and Capricious \n“The APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency action be reasonable \nand reasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).  \nDefendants’ decision to terminate NEH is unlawful because Defendants failed to engage in \n“‘reasoned decisionmaking’” as required by the APA. Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 \n(2015) (citing Allentown Mack Sales & Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998)).  “Not \nonly must an agency’s decreed result be within the scope of its lawful authority, but the process \nby which it reaches that result must be logical and rational.”  Id. (quotations omitted). \nDefendants neither “articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for [their] action[s],” see \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983), nor did \nthey “consider ‘serious reliance interests’” that would be impacted by the agency’s sudden and \ndrastic termination of the Federal State Partnership, see FDA v. Wages & White Lion Invs., \nL.L.C., 145 S.Ct. 898, 917 (2025) (quoting Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221–22 \n(2016)). \nDefendants have offered only meaningless and boilerplate explanations as to why they \nterminated support of the Councils, halved promised support, and gutted the Office of \nFederal/State Partnership.  For example, the notices of terminations state only that the grants “no \nlonger effectuate[] the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions of the Grant Agreement and \nis subject to termination due to several reasonable causes, as outlined in 2 CFR §200.340. NEH \nhas reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its \nfunding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”  (Davis Decl. \nEx. A.) \nThe only public explanation NEH has offered for the recent flurry of actions is a \n“Statement on NEH Priorities,” which NEH posted on April 24, weeks after taking most of the \nrelevant actions. (Sortun Decl. Ex. C.)  The “Statement” asserts that NEH is now focused only on \nPAGE 24 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 31 of 37\n“projects related to the nation’s semiquincentennial and American exceptionalism,” and that \n“NEH has recommitted itself to ensuring that its funding, as required by statute, contributes to \npublic confidence in how it expends taxpayer funds.”  Id.5  Even if this was relevant, the \nexplanation came after the actual decisions and therefore is a post-hoc rationalization that cannot \nbe considered as part of the agency’s decision.  Moreover, the Statement provides no explanation \nfor the termination and partial rescissions.  NEH thus has not adequately explained its actions, \nand it certainly has not provided a “rational connection between the facts . . . and the choice \nmade.” NRDC, 658 F.3d at 215.  NEH’s actions should be enjoined on this ground alone.  See, \ne.g., id. at 217; AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. V. U.S. Dep’t of State, 770 F. Supp. 3d 121, 138 \n(D.D.C. 2025); Widakuswara, 2025 WL 945869, at *5. \nThese vague, “conclusory statements will not do” to explain the agency action.  Amerijet \nInt’l v. Pistole, 753 F.3d 1343, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of \nAm. V. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 358 F.3d 40, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“[A] statement that there was a \n“change in agency priorities,” without explanation, is not informative in the least[.]”). \nNor did NEH provide any advance notice that it was executing a major change in policy.  \nAs the Supreme Court reiterated recently, “[t]he change-in-position doctrine” prevents agencies \nfrom “mislead[ing] regulated entities.”  Wages & White Lion Invs., 145 S. Ct. at 917.  Under that \ndoctrine, “[a]gencies are free to change their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned \nexplanation for the change,” “display awareness that [they are] changing position,” and “consider \nserious reliance interests.”  Id. (quoting Encino Motorcars, 579 U.S. at 221–22).  Here, \n \n5\n The same day, NEH announced a new grant program to fund statues for a “National Garden of \nAmerican Heroes.” The proposed program calls for NEH to issue grants to artists to “create life-\nsize statues in marble, granite, bronze, copper, or brass depicting historical figures tied to the \naccomplishments of the United States.” (Sortun Decl. Ex. D.) Unlike prior programs, the \nNotification of Funding Opportunity did not include limitations on using NEH funds for projects \n“outside of . . . the humanities,” including the “creation…of art.” See Press Release, NEH \nAnnounces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of \nAmerican Heroes (Apr. 24, 2025), https://perma.cc/BR7Y-U87N. This constitutes illegal \nreprogramming of congressional funds. \nPAGE 25 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 32 of 37\nDefendants issued no public-facing statements and provided no advance notice that they were \nradically changing agency policy via drastically reduced support to the Councils. \nLast, there is no indication that Defendants considered “serious reliance interests” on the \npart of Councils, the Federation, and the public, all of which have depended on steady NEH \nsupport for decades.  See Wages & White Lion Invs., 145 S. Ct. at 917 (quoting Encino \nMotorcars, 579 U.S. at 221–22).  Plaintiffs and partner organizations have reliance interests in \nplanning and budgeting programs based on Congressional appropriations and the agency’s \nsigned commitment to support programs for a specific award period under the rules in place at \nthe time the award is made. \nDefendants did not consider any of these reliance interests, much less weigh them against \ncompeting policy concerns (if any), or consider any alternatives (such as honoring existing \nprogram commitments and reserving any drastic policy changes for future programs).  In sum, \nDefendants failed to engage in any “reasoned decisionmaking” whatsoever, see Michigan, 576 \nU.S. at 750, and the dismantling of NEH therefore is arbitrary and capricious.  See Encino \nMotorcars, 579 U.S. at 222 (“[A] reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and \ncircumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”). \nII.  Defendants Cannot Avoid the Merits by Relying on Jurisdictional Arguments \nDefendants cannot escape a likely loss on the merits by relying on the same jurisdictional \narguments they have raised elsewhere.  First, Plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims.  As \ndetailed in Part II, Defendants’ actions to destroy the Federal State Partnership are causing \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs.  Those harms are directly traceable to Defendants’ unlawful \nconduct and will be redressed by the requested injunctive and declaratory relief.  See TransUnion \nLLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) (standing requires injury-in-fact, causation, and \nredressability). \nPlaintiff Federation has both direct standing to sue and associational standing to pursue \nrelief on behalf of its member organizations.  The Federation has direct standing to sue because it \nsuffered direct harm to its core activities as a result of Defendants. (Stein Decl. at ¶ 19.)  It also \nPAGE 26 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 33 of 37\nhas associational standing because it can show that “(1) at least one of its members would have \nstanding to sue in his own right; (2) the interests the suit seeks to vindicate are germane to the \norganization’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted, nor the relief requested requires the \nparticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Fleck & Assocs., Inc. v. Phoenix, 471 F.3d \n1100, 1105–06 (9th Cir. 2006); see also Stein Decl. \nSecond, this Court—not the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act—has \njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.  As in Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 905 (1988), \nnone of the issues here involve the sorts of contractual obligations that are appropriately dealt \nwith by the Court of Federal Claims. Rather, this case challenges Defendants’ decision to \nterminate and partially rescind grants to Councils.  The claims are founded in the Constitution \nand federal statutes and regulations governing NEH, and the relief sought is purely equitable—to \nvacate illegal agency actions and an injunction to return to the status quo. \nEven though federal payments may be “engend[ered]” as a “by-product” of the “court’s \nprimary function of reviewing the [administration’s] interpretation of federal law,” that does not \nturn this Constitutional and APA case into a contractual suit for damages.  Id. at 910; see also id. \nat 895 (distinguishing “money damages,” i.e., compensatory relief as “a substitute for a suffered \nloss,” from equitable relief that seeks “the very thing to which [plaintiff] was entitled”); see also \nMaine Comm. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. 296, 323–24 (2020) (“[W]hen the \n[APA] provides an avenue for relief,” “[t]he Tucker Act yields.”); Randall v. United States, 95 F. \n3d 339, 347 (4th Cir. 1996) (injunctive relief was essence of complaint because “Plaintiff’s claim \nfor back pay would only arise if Plaintiff’s request for retroactive promotion were granted”). \nFor that reason, Defendants cannot rely on the Supreme Court’s decision granting a stay \nin Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025), because the Court there \ncharacterized the plaintiffs as seeking “orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay \nmoney.’”  Id.  Indeed, the Court reiterated in that very case that district court jurisdiction “‘is not \nbarred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an agency’s action may result in the \ndisbursement of funds.”  Id. (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 910). \nPAGE 27 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 34 of 37\nIII.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Without Preliminary Relief \nPlaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.  Winter \nv. Natural Resources Def. Counc., Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 120 S.Ct. 365 (2008).  Some of the \nCouncils, for example Arkansas, Ohio, and Mississippi, have indicated their financial situation is \nentirely uncertain and they are operating on reserve funds.  See, e.g, Rockoff Decl. ¶¶ 2, 15. \nThe irreparable harm that will be caused to Plaintiffs in the absence of preliminary relief \nis about more than money, however.  The disruptions at NEH have put the delivery of humanities \nprogramming around the country at imminent risk—some of this harm has already occurred and \nis occurring daily, as outlined above and in the supporting declarations of Council Executive \nDirectors.  Communities and organizations throughout the country rely upon the Councils for \nsupport—and now that support is evaporating.  Defendants’ actions are damaging the reputations \nand stability of the Councils.  In the words of Rebecca Asmo, Executive Director for Ohio \nHumanities Council (“OHC”): \nThe abrupt loss of NEH funding has forced OHC to break \ncommitments to organizations it has long-standing relationships \nwith, causing irreparable harm to their operations and to our \nreputation as a trustworthy partner. … [M]ost troubling is the \nimpact these funding losses are having on communities across \nOhio right now. OHC’s grant contracts are designed to serve the \npublic. Each of the projects described above are accessible to the \npublic at low or no cost. On April 2, 2025, Ohioans were robbed of \nmany opportunities to learn about our history, our culture and our \nshared human experience. Every day that goes by that this funding \nis not available; Ohioans lose opportunities to learn and connect. \nOHC has also suffered financial hardship as a result of NEH grant \nterminations. At the time of the grant termination, 90% of OHC’s \napproximately $1.9M annual budget came from NEH funds. To \nsustain operations now and as long as this crisis persists, OHC will \ngo from five full time staff to 3 full time staff beginning July 1, \n2025. We have also elected not to fill a vacant full-time \nfundraising position. We are using non-federal cash reserves to \noperate during this time, something that will ultimately weaken our \nfinancial strength as a non-profit organization in the future.  \nThe termination of all of OHC’s NEH funding has been a \ntraumatic experience for the public humanities community in Ohio. \nPAGE 28 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 35 of 37\nIt has harmed OHC’s standing as a leader in Ohio’s cultural sector \nand damaged the reputations, finances and operations of our \ngrantees who work hard every day to serve and educate the public \n– especially those in small and marginalized communities. \nWinning back the trust of our community will be difficult, and I \ndoubt the public humanities community will view OHC as a \ncompletely reliable partner again in the future. \n(Asmo Decl. at 12-14.)  Ohio’s experience is being played out in locations all over the country. \nGabrielle Lyon, Executive Director of Illinois Humanities Council, summarizes the importance \nof the Councils’ work as follows: “America was built on the idea that no matter who you are or \nwhere you come from, if you work hard, you can build a better life for yourself and your family. \nIllinois Humanities’ part in all of this is helping build quality of life by ensuring the places \npeople live support them to be creative, connected, and in community.  Every American should \nhave access to arts, culture, and history—all the things that help people make a better life for \nthemselves, their children, and their grandchildren.”  (Lyon Dec. ¶ 11.)  As these representative \nexamples illustrate, the Federation, the Councils, and all Americans will suffer irreparable harm \nif preliminary relief is not granted. \nIV.  The Balance of Equities and the Public Interest Weigh in Plaintiffs’ Favor \nThe final two factors—balance of the equities and weighing the public interest—“merge \nwhen the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  Here, \nthose factors overwhelmingly support maintaining the Federal State Partnership at NEH during \nthe pendency of this case. \nThe public “undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its governmental institutions follow the \nlaw,” Roe, 947 F.3d at 230–31, whereas Defendants suffer no harm from an injunction that \nmerely ends unlawful action.  Open Cmtys. All. v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. \n2017).  Indeed, “‘there is a substantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by \nthe federal laws’ . . . ‘that govern their existence and operations.’”  Id. (quoting League of \nWomen Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016)).  Moreover, the ongoing harm \nto Councils and the people that they serve outweighs any inconvenience to Defendants. \nPAGE 29 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 36 of 37\nPlaintiffs are faced with the immediate and unanticipated termination of longstanding \nfederal support in the middle of a fiscal year.  Each of the supporting executive director \ndeclarations describe the particular harms faced across the country—financial, reputational, \ncommunity-based, local, and other impacts are continuing to play out each day NEH continues to \nviolate the law. \nBy contrast, the only burden on Defendants is that they will be required to maintain NEH \nas the law requires, and support programs and grants that Congress has appropriated funds for \nand that the agency previously approved.  As in HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, Plaintiffs face “enormous \nburdens” due to Defendants’ unlawful actions that will likely cause humanities programming to \n“clos[e] entirely in [their] jurisdictions,” whereas Defendants only would be enjoined to preserve \nagency functions according to “well-established processes refined over several decades.”  985 \nF.3d at 326.  Under these circumstances, “the public interest is served by maintaining the status \nquo during the pendency of this litigation.”  Id.; see also Doe v. Trump, — F. Supp. 3d —, 2025 \nWL 485070, at *14 (D. Mass. Feb. 13, 2025) (equities favored injunction that “will do no more \nthan maintain a status quo that has been in place for well over a century”), aff’d sub nom., New \nJersey v. Trump, 131 F.4th 27, 2 (1st Cir. 2025). \nV.  The Court Should Enjoin the Actions Taken to Damage the Federal State \nPartnership \nBased on the foregoing violations and harms, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court \nenter a entering a stay under section 705 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \n§ 705, and a preliminary injunction against all Defendants: \n1.  Enjoining, pending further order of the Court, Defendants, their agents, and \nanyone acting at Defendants’ direction to restore the Federal State Partnership by returning NEH \ngrants to state and jurisdictional humanities counsels to the status quo prior to the termination \nand rescission decisions. \nPAGE 30 – MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 8      Filed 06/25/25      Page 37 of 37\n2.  Requiring Defendants to file, within one week of entry of this order and every \nmonth thereafter until resolution of the merits, a Status Report documenting the actions that they \nhave taken to comply with the Court’s order. \nThis requested injunction is narrowly tailored to provide complete relief for the specific \nharms suffered by Plaintiffs.  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979) (injunction \n“should be no more burdensome to the defendant than to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs \nbefore the court” (emphasis added)).  In crafting equitable relief, courts must consider “what is \nnecessary, what is fair, and what is workable.”  North Carolina v. Covington, 581 U.S. 486, 488 \n(2017) (quotation omitted).  Based on these principles, Plaintiffs have limited the requested \nrelief, wherever workable, to remedy their harm suffered. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, in the Amended Complaint, and in the supporting \ndeclarations filed herewith, Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to enjoin Defendants as \nrequested in the Motion. \nDATED:  June 25, 2025. \nTONKON TORP LLP \nBy:   s/ Anna Sortun   \nAnna Sortun, OSB No. 045279 \n   Direct:  503.802.2107 \n   Email:  anna.sortun@tonkon.com \nSteven M.

INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE  \nThe Amici States of Oregon, Maryland, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Hawai‘i; Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, \nVermont, and the District of Columbia file this brief in support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction (Dkt. No. 7).  The Amici States are home to state humanities councils \nwhose grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (“NEH”) were unlawfully \nterminated.  The Amici States file this brief to highlight the interests of their residents and \ninstitutions that benefit directly and indirectly from the federal government’s investments in \nAmerican culture and to defend the legal principles that Defendants’ conduct violates. \n“Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens.”  20 U.S.C. § 951(4).  Congress \npassed the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-209, 79 \nStat. 845 (Sept. 29, 1965) (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. §§ 951–960), to “foster and support \na form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all \nbackgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 951(4).  Forty percent of NEH’s program funds go directly to a network of state and \nterritorial humanities councils represented by the Federation of State Humanities Councils \n(“FSHC”) in this case.1  Each of the Amici States is home to a humanities council that works as \nCongress directed to “furnish adequate programs in the humanities in each of the several States.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(1).  \nThe Amici States also file this brief to request that the Court uphold important legal \nprinciples that Defendants’ conduct threatens.  “Public funds provided by the Federal \nGovernment must ultimately serve public purposes the Congress defines.”  20 U.S.C. § 951(5) \n(emphasis added).  The summary termination of grants to FSHC’s member councils appears to \nbe part of a wide-ranging campaign by the Trump Administration to unlawfully dismantle \n1 Impact in States & Jurisdictions, NEH, https://www.neh.gov/impact/states (last visited July 2, \n2025).  \nPage 1 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 10 of 29\ncongressionally mandated programs it dislikes.  Across the country, the Amici States have \nsuccessfully challenged the Administration’s attempts to terminate federal grant programs as \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”).  Here too, the Court should reiterate that federal district courts have jurisdiction over \nclaims that the Federal Government has violated the APA by wrongfully terminating awards of \nfederal grant money, notwithstanding Defendants’ anticipated argument that the Tucker Act (28 \nU.S.C. § 1491) deprives this Court of jurisdiction.  The Amici States have a strong interest in \nupholding existing precedent, vindicating separation of powers principles, and enjoining \nviolations of federal law that have caused and, if unchecked, will continue to cause concrete \ninjuries to the States and threaten the constitutional balance of power between the States and the \nFederal government.    \nII. BACKGROUND \nIn the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, Congress \ndeclared it “necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to complement, assist, and \nadd to programs for the advancement of the humanities and the arts by local, State, regional, and \nprivate agencies and their organizations.”  20 U.S.C. § 951(5).  Toward that end, Congress \npassed the Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Affairs Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-462, § 104(a), 90 Stat. \n1971 (Oct. 8, 1976), authorizing NEH “to establish and carry out a program of grants-in-aid in \neach of the several States . . . in order to develop a program in the humanities in such a manner \nas will furnish adequate programs in the humanities in each of the several States.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(f)(1).  Under the statute, the NEH state grant program is carried out through FSHC’s \nmember councils, which are 501(c)(3) nonprofits that administer NEH funds for their respective \nStates.2\n2 The NEH state grant program was modeled after the state grant program of NEH’s sister \nendowment, the National Endowment for the Arts (“NEA”).  20 U.S.C. § 954(g)(1); see S. Rep. \nNo. 94-1260, at 16 (1976) (Conf. Rep.); Memorandum to Members of the National Council on \nPage 2 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 11 of 29\nThe States maintain close ties with their state humanities councils.  Under 20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(f)(2)(B)(ii), up to a quarter of each humanities council’s board is appointed by the State’s \nGovernor.  The States also provide material and financial support to their councils.  The \nExecutive Director and Associate Director of Wisconsin Humanities are both employees of the \nUniversities of Wisconsin Administration.3  Connecticut’s, Maine’s, and Vermont’s humanities \ncouncils all receive appropriations from their state legislatures,4 while Delaware and Hawai‘i \naward their humanities councils annual grants-in-aid,5 and Michigan Humanities is supported by \na grant from the Michigan Arts and Culture Council.6  The Arizona Humanities Awards are \nsponsored by Arizona State University’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.7  Maryland \nHumanities receives funding from Maryland Historical Trust and the State Department of \nthe Humanities re State-Based Public Humanities Programs 1 (Aug. 11, 1970), \nhttps://neh.dspacedirect.org/items/ca08fcd9-3b62-4275-b56b-bd2d8abd0fb3.  To receive NEA \nfunds, Congress required that States “designate[] or provide[] for the establishment of a State \n[arts] agency,” 20 U.S.C. § 954(g)(2)(A), but for NEH funds, it allowed States either to designate \na state humanities agency or to administer funds through nonprofit state humanities councils, 20 \nU.S.C. § 956(f)(2)(A).  No State currently has designated a state humanities agency, although at \nleast one—Iowa—has in the recent past.  See Humanities Iowa redesignated as the state \nhumanities council, ia Mag.

L. 119-4, § 1101(a)(7), 139 Stat. 11 (Mar. 15, 2025) (reappropriating \namounts from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, div. E, tit. III, 138 \nStat. 281 (Mar. 9, 2024)), of which it directed that $65 million go toward “Federal/State \npartnership.”  170 Cong. Rec. S1859 (Mar. 5, 2024) (Joint Explanatory Statement).  NEH duly \nassigned $65 million to Fed/State in Fiscal Year 2024, the largest line item in the agency’s \nbudget.20  The state humanities councils then used money received from Fed/State to “furnish \nadequate programs in the humanities.”  20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(1). \nThat federal/state partnership nearly ended in April 2025, when the U.S. DOGE Service \nbegan to eliminate Fed/State and terminate its grants.  See Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 6, ¶¶ 101–04; \nJane Doe Decl. ¶ 8 (Dkt. No. 12).  On April 2, at DOGE’s direction, NEH sent every state \nhumanities council a notice terminating its standard operating grants, as well as special \nopportunity and competitive grants issued under the Biden Administration.  See Stein Decl. ¶ 13 \n(Dkt. No. 20).  Although NEH eventually restored less than half the funding that had been \nterminated—which the then-Director of Fed/State acknowledged “still represent[ed] an \nincredible hardship”—Defendants still have deprived the state humanities councils of millions of \ndollars in funding.  Davis Decl. ¶ 13 (Dkt. No. 11).  And they likewise have contravened \nCongress’s intent—by preventing NEH from ensuring “adequate programs in the humanities in \neach of the several States.”  20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(1). \nDue to the funding cuts, many humanities programs already have been cancelled or will \nnot be repeated as planned in 2025 or 2026.  “[C]hanges to federal funding from the NEH caused \nWisconsin Humanities to enter hibernation in June 2025, pausing programming for Community \n20 NEH, FY 2024 Appropriations, https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2024-\n08/FY%202024%20Appropriations%20Breakdown%20New%20Logo%20small.pdf (last visited \nJuly 2, 2025). \nPage 6 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 15 of 29\nPowered.”21  Oregon Humanities’ program, Humanity in Perspective, “is currently paused.”22  At \nArizona Humanities, “[g]rants are currently suspended until a determination is made regarding \nthe availability of federal funds,”23 and at Michigan Humanities, “all programs and grants are \ncurrently suspended.”24  Even “[c]ommunity celebrations being planned to commemorate the \nnation’s 250th anniversary next year are at risk of being significantly scaled back or canceled” \nbecause the state humanities councils have far “less money for programming.”25  Considering \nthat the 1976 Act specifically authorized NEH to support “bicentennial programs” to “assess[] \nwhere our society and Government stand in relation to the founding principles of the Republic,” \n20 U.S.C. § 956(h)(1)(F), Congress hardly can have desired that result. \nIII.

Am. Compl. ¶¶ 125–54.   \nThe APA “embodies [a] basic presumption of judicial review to one ‘suffering legal \nwrong because of agency action.’”  Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140–41 (1967) \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  The APA waives sovereign immunity for suits challenging agency \nactions that “seek[] relief other than money damages,” unless “any other statute that grants \nconsent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  This \nbroad waiver “is for all equitable actions for specific relief against a Federal agency or officer \nacting in an official capacity.”  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. United States, 490 F.3d 50, 57–\n58 (1st Cir. 2007) (citation modified) (emphasis in original).  The APA also requires that there be \n“no other adequate remedy in a court” for an action to proceed.  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Here, Plaintiffs’ \nclaims fall within § 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity because they seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief against final agency action, not “money damages,” and because no other statute \n“forbids the relief which is sought” here.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  Furthermore, the remedies available in \nthe Court of Federal Claims would be inadequate to redress Plaintiffs’ harms.   \n1. Plaintiffs do not seek money damages. \nPlaintiffs’ claims fall within APA § 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity because they do \nnot seek “money damages,” but rather equitable relief under the APA.  In their prayer for relief, \nPlaintiffs ask this court to vacate or set aside the blanket grant terminations and recissions.  \nAmend. Compl., Prayer for Relief §§ D, E.  Plaintiffs ask further to “[e]njoin Defendants from \nenforcing or giving effect to their decisions to eliminate the Fed/State Office at NEH, to shut \ndown processing of all open grants to state and jurisdictional humanities councils, and to delay or \nrefuse to spend the funds appropriated to NEH by Congress.”  Id. ¶ F.  The essence of those \nclaims and Plaintiffs’ requested relief is equitable in nature, even though it may involve the \nincidental payment of money.  \nPage 8 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 17 of 29\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988), “[t]he \nfact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a sufficient \nreason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages.’”  Id. at 893.  The Court expressly \ndistinguished “money damages,” which “substitutefor a suffered loss,” from “specific \nremedies,” which “attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled.”  Id. at \n895 (citation modified) (emphasis omitted).  The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the \ndistinction between “specific relief and compensatory, or substitute, relief,” emphasizing that the \nAPA waives sovereign immunity for the former but not the latter.  Dep’t of the Army v. Blue \nFox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 261 (1999) (citing Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895); see also Great-West Life & \nAnnuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212 (2002) (citing Blue Fox, and noting that the suit \nin Bowen “was not merely for past due sums, but for an injunction to correct the method of \ncalculating payments going forward,” and that “Bowen has no bearing on the unavailability of an \ninjunction to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money past due”). \nPlaintiffs here seek specific equitable relief to give them “the very thing to which [they \nare] entitled.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895.  Because they seek “relief other than money damages,” \nthe APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity applies.  5 U.S.C. § 702. \n2. The Tucker Act does not divest this Court of subject matter jurisdiction. \nThe Amici States anticipate that Defendants will challenge this Court’s ability to hear \nPlaintiffs’ claims by arguing that the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), which gives the Court \nof Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction over claims for damages based on, inter alia, contracts \nwith the United States, is controlling in this case.  But the Tucker Act does not divest this Court \nof subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims. \nThe Ninth Circuit recently explained that “[i]f rights and remedies are statutorily or \nconstitutionally based, then district courts have jurisdiction; if rights and remedies are \ncontractually based then only the Court of Federal Claims does.”  Cmty. Legal Servs. in E. Palo \nAlto v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 137 F.4th 932, 938 (9th Cir. 2025) (quoting United \nPage 9 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 18 of 29\nAeronautical Corp. v. U.S. Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 2023)).  The operative \nquestion is whether the claims are “founded . . . upon” contract, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), not \nwhether a contract is “involved” in the case.  See Katz v. Cisneros, 16 F.3d 1204, 1209 (Fed. Cir. \n1994) (“The answer to the sovereign immunity and jurisdiction questions depends not simply on \nwhether a case involves contract issues, but on whether, despite the presence of a contract, \nplaintiffs’ claims are founded only on a contract, or whether they stem from a statute or the \nConstitution.”) (citation modified) (emphases added); see also Crowley Gov’t Servs. v. GSA, 38 \nF.4th 1099, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (although plaintiff’s claim “f[e]ll within that category of \ncases . . . in which ‘[c]ontract issues may arise,’” jurisdiction did not lie under the Tucker Act \nbecause “‘the action itself [was] not founded on a contract’”) (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, \n672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of the Fed. Reserve \nEmp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (looking to whether the non-contract source \nof rights speaks to “the issues at stake in this case”). \nPlaintiffs’ claims here are not “‘disguised’ breach-of-contract claims”; they are founded \nupon Defendants’ alleged violations of the NEH statutes and the Constitution.  See Cmty. Legal \nServs., 137 F.4th at 937 (quoting United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1026).  In particular, \nPlaintiffs contend that the termination and recissions violate 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4), which \nmandates that, for congressionally-appropriated funds for any fiscal year, “each State and each \ngrant recipient which has a plan approved by the Chairperson shall be allotted at least $200,000” \nand that when congressional appropriations are in excess of funds necessary to make such \nallotment, the States shall receive additional amounts.  Am. Compl. ¶ 130.  Plaintiffs also \ncontend that the agency actions violate NEH regulations that state that NEH will “process \nreimbursements to councils with previously approved grants and set forth a statutory process for \nany grant termination.”  Id. ¶ 131.  In both respects, Plaintiffs assert that the agency actions are \n“not in accordance with law” and thereby violate the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \nPage 10 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 19 of 29\nTo decide Plaintiffs’ claims, this Court must determine whether the agency’s actions \nwere unlawful, not whether the terms of the individual grants were breached.  Indeed, Federal \nDefendants do not claim that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the terms of the grants.26  Thus, \n“[P]laintiffs’ APA claims are based on the Government’s statutory and regulatory violations, not \nany government contract.”  See Cmty. Legal Servs., 137 F.4th at 937; Aids Vaccine Advocacy \nCoal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 770 F. Supp. 3d 121 (D.D.C. 2025) (“[I]t would be quite \nextraordinary to consider Plaintiffs’ claims to sound in breach of contract when they do not at all \ndepend on whether the terms of particular awards were breached—they instead challenge \nwhether the agency action here was unlawful, irrespective of any breach.”), stay denied, 145 \nS.Ct. 753 (2025) (mem.).  Because “[t]he grant terms are simply not relevant to this case at all,” \njurisdiction does not lie under the Tucker Act.  See Maryland v. Corp. for Nat’l & Cmty. Serv., \nNo. DLB-25-1363, 2025 WL 1585051, at *23 (D. Md. June 5, 2025) (holding that challenge to \nmass termination of AmeriCorps programs arose under the APA, not the Tucker Act).   \n3. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy under the Tucker Act. \nAnother reason the Court of Federal Claims is not the proper venue for this action is that \nit cannot afford Plaintiffs an adequate remedy.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 704, APA review is limited to \nsituations in which “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  Id.  “If the suit is at base a \nclaim for money, and the relief available through the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker \nAct—a money judgment—will provide an adequate remedy,” then the action cannot proceed \nunder the APA.  Suburban Mortg. Assocs. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 480 F.3d 1116, \n26 Even if the agency had concluded that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the terms of the grants, \nit would have been required to afford Plaintiffs “reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing” \nbefore “notify[ing] [them] . . . that no further grants will be made . . . until there is no longer a \ndefault or failure to comply.”  20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  That did not occur.  Moreover, the statute \nonly allows the agency to withhold “further grants” for noncompliance, id. (emphasis added), not \nto cancel grants that already have been awarded.  See Kichatov v. Nationstar Mortg., No. 3:13-\nCV-00103-BR, 2013 WL 3025981, at *5 (D. Or. June 14, 2013) (“[W]here a law expressly \ndescribes a particular situation to which it shall apply, what was omitted or excluded was \nintended to be omitted or excluded.”) (quoting Reyes-Gaona v. N.C. Growers Ass’n, 250 F.3d \n861, 865 (4th Cir. 2001)). \nPage 11 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 20 of 29\n1125 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Here, however, the Court of Federal Claims cannot provide Plaintiffs an \nadequate remedy because Plaintiffs do not merely seek “specific sums already calculated, past \ndue, and designed to compensate for completed labors.”  See Me. Cmty. Health Options v. United \nStates, 590 U.S. 296, 298–99 (2020).  Instead, Plaintiffs seek prospective, declaratory, and \ninjunctive relief.  That is, Plaintiffs seek the reinstatement of grants that NEH has funded \nannually for decades under its Fed/State program.27  As in Bowen, a “naked money judgment” \nfor the sums owed under this year’s grants is not “an adequate substitute for prospective relief \nfashioned in the light of the rather complex ongoing relationship between the parties.”  See 487 \nU.S. at 905.  Because Plaintiffs seek declaratory and “prospective relief”—which the Court of \nFederal Claims “does not have the general equitable powers of a district court to grant”—the \nrelief available through the Court of Federal Claims is not adequate and jurisdiction properly lies \nunder the APA.  See id. \n4. The Supreme Court’s per curiam stay order in Department of Education v. \nCalifornia does not resolve the jurisdictional questions presented in this case. \nThe Supreme Court’s per curiam order in Department of Education v. California, 604 \nU.S. __, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025), does not dictate a different result.  In that case, the Supreme \nCourt stayed a temporary restraining order that “enjoin[ed] the Government from terminating \nvarious education-related grants,” reasoning that the government was “likely to succeed in \nshowing the District Court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA.”  \nId. at 968.  In doing so, however, the Supreme Court reiterated that, under Bowen, “a district \ncourt’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an agency’s action \nmay result in the disbursement of funds.”  Id. (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 910).  The California\nstay order does not compel the conclusion that this Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \nclaims. \n27 As noted supra, the statute does not even authorize NEH to cancel existing grants to state \nhumanities councils, but only to withhold “further grants” based on finding noncompliance \n(“after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing”). \nPage 12 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 21 of 29\nFirst, California did not overturn, narrow, or distinguish Bowen, which it cited as good \nlaw.  To the contrary, California was merely an emergency ruling on an application to stay a \ntemporary restraining order pending further briefing and review.  See 145 S. Ct. 966; Pet., \nCalifornia, No. 24A910 (filed Mar. 26, 2025).  It was “not a decision on the merits,” see Merrill \nv. Milligan, 142 S. Ct. 879, 879 (2022) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring), and its discussion of the \nTucker Act is limited to one paragraph.  See California, 145 S. Ct. at 968.  California does not \nalter existing precedent regarding the relationship between the Tucker Act and the APA.  Id.   \nSecond, the facts in California are entirely inapposite.  In California, where the \ndefendants terminated almost all grants under two statutorily-authorized teacher training \nprograms, defendants insisted that “each grant was reviewed on its own terms, and the Secretary \n[of Education] and her senior staff engaged in grant-by-grant consideration that resulted in \ntermination of most—but not all—of the current grants under the relevant programs.”  Mem. \nSupp. Defs.’ Mot. for Emergency Stay Pending Appeal, No. 1:25-cv-10548-MJJ, ECF 55, at 1 \n(D. Mass. Mar. 12, 2025).  Here, Defendants did not consider the terms and conditions of any\nindividual grants.  Instead, they issued substantively identical blanket termination letters to \nnearly 1500 grantees; then NEH backtracked and told the states it would “fund[] the humanities \ncouncils at 20 percent of its appropriation of program funds,” without regard to the needs of any \nparticular grantee.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 108–11.  Defendants offered no explanation for this abrupt \nchange in position and provided neither notice nor opportunity to be heard.  Id. ¶¶ 84, 90, 92.  \nThus, unlike in California, Defendants have not even arguably implicated the terms and \nconditions of individual grants, and Plaintiffs plainly challenge an across-the-board termination \ndecision that is reviewable under the APA.   \nRelatedly, Plaintiffs have not sought to “enforce a contractual obligation to pay money,” \nas singled out in the California order.  145 S. Ct. at 968.  Bowen made clear that challenging an \nagency action that implements a broadly-applicable policy does not amount to a request for \n“money damages,” even if “a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another.”  \nPage 13 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 22 of 29\n487 U.S. at 893.  Here, Plaintiffs “challenge[] [NEH]’s actions implementing a categorical \npolicy” to terminate state humanities councils’ funding across the board.  See Rhode Island v. \nTrump, No. 1:25-cv-128-JJM-LDA, 2025 WL 1303868, at *6 (D.R.I. May 6, 2025).  “[N]owhere \nare the parties quibbling over whether the [humanities councils] subject to those grant \nterminations breached the terms or conditions of the underlying agreements as to transform this \naction into one sounding in contract.”  Id.  Plaintiffs thus have not brought “a claim [that] is ‘at \nits essence’ contractual.”  See id. (quoting Crowley Gov’t Servs., 38 F.4th at 1106).  \nAccordingly, the per curiam stay order in California does not indicate that this court \nlacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.  Indeed, many district courts recently \nhave determined that they have subject matter jurisdiction over similar APA claims.  See, e.g., \nCorp. for Nat’l & Cmty. Serv., 2025 WL 1585051, at *22–28 (Tucker Act did not apply to claim \nthat AmeriCorps violated APA by terminating grants for programs established under the national \nservice laws); Cmty.

And the Ninth \nCircuit already denied the Administration’s request to stay one of those decisions, holding that \n“the Government ha[d] not shown a likelihood of success on its Tucker Act argument.”  Cmty. \nLegal Servs., 137 F.4th at 939.  Here too, this Court should hold that the Tucker Act is not \nimplicated and that this Court has jurisdiction over the APA claims. \nB. A preliminary injunction is warranted. \nA preliminary injunction is warranted where the moving party establishes that: (1) it is \nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) irreparable harm is likely in the absence of preliminary relief; \n(3) the balance of equities tips in the movant’s favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public \ninterest.  Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1).  All of those factors \nstrongly weigh in favor of Plaintiffs.  Accordingly, this Court should enter a preliminary \ninjunction to restore the status quo while the merits of the case can be reviewed. \n1. Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits. \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of all their claims.  First, the termination of \nNEH grants, followed by the partial recission at a greatly reduced rate, is arbitrary and \ncapricious, and therefore violates the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  It is “a fundamental \nrequirement of administrative law . . . that an agency set forth its reasons for decision; an \nagency’s failure to do so constitutes arbitrary and capricious agency action.”  Amerijet Int’l v. \nPistole, 753 F.3d 1343, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  “[C]onclusory statements will not do; an \nagency’s statement must be one of reasoning.”  Id. (emphasis in original); see also Dep’t of \nCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 (2019) (an agency must “articulate[] ‘a satisfactory \nexplanation’ for [its] decision” (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of United States, Inc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  Here, Defendants failed to identify a reasoned \nbasis for their wholesale termination of all open NEH grants, nor did they explain the reason for \nPage 15 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 24 of 29\nrescinding some of those terminations and instituting an across-the-board reduction in funds for \nsome but not all open grants.   \nFurthermore, Defendants’ actions fail to account for the serious reliance interests that \nPlaintiffs have in NEH grant awards.  SeeDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of \nCal., 591 U.S. 1, 33 (2020) (“[B]ecause DHS was not writing on a blank slate, it was required to \nassess whether there were reliance interests, determine whether they were significant, and weigh \nany such interests against competing policy concerns.”) (citation modified).  “When an agency \nchanges course, . . . it must be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious \nreliance interests that must be taken into account.”  Id. at 30 (citation modified).  The NEH’s \nFed/State program has existed for more than 50 years, and Plaintiffs rely on NEH support to fund \nhumanities programs throughout the nation.28  The failure to consider—much less rationally \naddress—these reliance interests is arbitrary and capricious.     \nSecond, Defendants are violating the APA by not abiding by congressional \nappropriations.  Since 1972, the NEH has funded state humanities councils through \ncongressional appropriations, which are delineated in each fiscal year appropriation bill.  Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 7, 17.  For example, in Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025, $207 million was appropriated to \nthe NEH, $65 million of which was directed to go to the Fed/State partnership.  NEH funding for \nstate humanities councils is mandatory:  The statute provides that “each State and each grant \nrecipient which has a plan approved by the Chairperson shall be allotted at least $200,000.”  20 \nU.S.C. § 956(f)(4) (emphasis added).  If Congress appropriates funds in excess of the amount \n28 Underscoring the importance that Congress placed on the state humanities councils’ reliance \ninterests, the statute does not even allow NEH to cancel current grants for noncompliance, but \nonly to withhold “further grants” until any issues are rectified.  20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  The only \nway that NEH can stop funding a state humanities council permanently is if “a State desires to \ndesignate or to provide for the establishment of a State [humanities] agency,” and even then, \n“such State shall designate the humanities council in existence on the date the State agency is \nestablished as the State agency.”  Id. § 956(f)(2)(A); see also 126 Cong. Rec. S1282 (Feb. 7, \n1980) (Statement of Sen. Javits) (“[T]he State may establish an official State humanities council \nbased upon a requisite level of State appropriation for the humanities and the designation of the \nexisting humanities organization as the State council.”). \nPage 16 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 25 of 29\nrequired to make the $200,000 allotments, then “44 per centum of the amount of such excess for \nsuch fiscal year shall be allotted in equal amounts among the States and grant recipients which \nhave plans approved by the [NEH] Chairperson.”  Id. § 956(f)(4)(B) (emphasis added).  And “22 \nper centum of the amount of such excess for such fiscal year shall be allotted among the States \nand grant recipients which have plans approved by the Chairperson in amounts which bear the \nsame ratio to such excess as the population of the State for which the plan is approved.”  Id. § \n956(f)(4)(C) (emphasis added).  NEH has contravened these statutory provisions by first \neliminating the grants entirely and then reinstating them at only 20% of Congress’s total \nappropriation.  Id. § 956(f)(4)(B), (C).    \nThird, Defendants’ actions violate the Take Care Clause, which requires the President to \n“take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, “across the entire \nExecutive Branch—including ‘independent’ agencies.”  English v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, \n327 (D.D.C. 2018) (citing Free Enter. Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, 496–97 (2010)).  \n“Withholding congressionally appropriated funds, and effectively shuttering a congressionally \ncreated agency simply cannot be construed as following through on the constitutional mandate of \nthe Take Care Clause.”  Rhode Island v. Trump, 2025 WL 1303868, at *15 (citation modified). \nFourth, Defendants’ actions violate the Separation of Powers Clause, which grants the \nlegislative branch the exclusive power to make law, as well as the power of the purse.  U.S. \nConst. art. I, §§ 1, 8.  By contrast, “[t]here is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the \n[executive branch] to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 \nU.S. 417, 438 (1998).  By essentially gutting the NEH, Defendants have usurped Congress’s \nauthority to create and abolish federal agencies.  Federal Defendants have also usurped \nCongress’s power of the purse by disregarding its appropriations to the NEH and the Federal-\nState partnership.  Cf. In re Inst. of Museum & Library Servs., No. B-337375 (Comp. Gen. June \n16, 2025), https://www.gao.gov/assets/880/878908.pdf (concluding that agency violated \nPage 17 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 26 of 29\nImpoundment Control Act “by improperly withholding appropriated funds from obligation and \nexpenditure”). \nPlaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits supports granting the motion for \npreliminary injunction.  See, e.g., Rhode Island v. Trump, 2025 WL 1303868 (finding that states \nwere likely to succeed on merits of APA claims after federal government mandated elimination \nor reduction of non-statutory functions and personnel at Institute of Museum and Library \nServices, Minority Business Development Agency, and Federal Mediation and Conciliation \nService); Cmty. Legal Servs., 2025 WL 1233674 (finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on \nmerits of APA claims after federal government cut plaintiffs’ funding and ordered them to stop \nall work on contract through which the government provided funding). \n2. Defendants’ abrupt policy changes and communications irreparably harm \nPlaintiffs. \nDefendants’ illegal and arbitrary actions have caused, and will continue to cause, \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs.  The humanities are of paramount importance to a well-educated \ndemocratic society and the NEH is “the only federal agency in the United States dedicated to \nfunding the humanities.”  About the National Endowment for the Humanities, NEH, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/about (last visited July 2, 2025).  NEH grants cover a large portion of the \ncosts for activities that state humanities councils are required to provide under the statute.  20 \nU.S.C. § 956(f)(1) (allowing for up to 50% of the cost of state humanities councils’ activities to \nbe funded by NEH).  The grants “support the building blocks of American civil society, helping \nto examine the human condition, promote civics education, understand our cultural heritage, \nfoster mutual respect for diverse beliefs and cultures, and develop media and information \nliteracy.”  About the National Endowment for the Humanities, supra.   \nAs a result of Defendants’ actions, the state humanities councils have been forced to \nterminate or furlough staff, cancel programming and events, and pull support for local libraries, \nschools, and families.  Rockoff Decl. ¶ 2, 15 (Dkt. No. 18).  Grant awards that were previously \nPage 18 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 27 of 29\napproved have been either terminated or greatly reduced, leaving a deficit in the councils’ \nbudgets.  Id.; Asmo Decl. ¶ 12-14 (Dkt. No. 9).  This causes irreparable harm to Plaintiffs.   \n3. The public interest strongly favors granting a preliminary injunction. \nThe third and fourth Winter factors—“harm to the opposing party” and the “public \ninterest”—“merge when the Government is the opposing party,” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n435 (2009).  These factors favor the Plaintiffs in this case.   \n“[T]here is a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the \nfederal laws that govern their existence and operations.’”  League of Women Voters v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. \n1994)).  Indeed, courts have routinely observed that “there is generally no public interest in the \nperpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health \n& Hum. Servs., 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018).  Moreover, these cuts already are \nimpeding state humanities councils’ efforts to “furnish adequate programs in the humanities in \neach of the several States” 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(1) thereby harming the residents of the Amici \nStates that are deprived of important humanities programs.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (“In \nexercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public \nconsequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.”  (internal quotations \nomitted.)); Cassell v. Snyders, 990 F.3d 539, 545 (7th Cir. 2021) (public interest includes “the \nconsequences of granting or denying the injunction to non-parties”); Bernhardt v. Los Angeles \nCounty, 339 F.3d 920, 931 (9th Cir. 2003) (same). \nConversely, the federal government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely \nends an unlawful practice or reads a statute as required to avoid constitutional concerns.”  \nRodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013).  Here, as Plaintiffs have shown, \nDefendants’ actions transgress the law in multiple ways.  There is a strong public interest in \npreventing Defendants’ unlawful conduct and requiring NEH to comply with basic statutory and \nprocedural requirements as determined by Congress.   \nPage 19 -  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE \n         CCH/sv3/992828022  \nDepartment of Justice \n100 SW Market St.  \nPortland, OR 97201 \n(971) 673-1880/ Fax: (503) 947-4791 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 27      Filed 07/07/25      Page 28 of 29\nIII.

Understanding others is of \ngreat importance in our world, in international relations, trade and \ntourism, but also at home, as we encounter persons who may have \ndifferent experiences and convictions. Lack of cultural, historical, \nand linguistic competence and sensitivity may cost business. Not \neveryone needs to become a scholar in the humanities, but issues \nthe humanities address are relevant everywhere, for us all, as \ncitizens, as employees, and entrepreneurs, as humans.1 \nIn 1968, when the National Endowment for the Humanities (“NEH”) was in its infancy \nand a bill to continue its authorization and increase its funding was before Congress, U.S. \nRepresentative William D. Ford of Michigan spoke about the need for continued federal funding \nfor the arts and humanities. He explained that \nthe arts and the humanities are essential to our national interest. \nThey are essential because they offer to our citizens the tools to \nexplore ultimate directions and to define the goals to which public \nand private life should be directed. Indeed, the arts and the \nhumanities are as essential to a nation as a conscience is to an \nindividual. . . .  \n \nThe study of the arts and the humanities has relevance to our \ncurrent domestic situation also. The members know well the issues \narising from this situation: The meaning of “justice”; the relation \nbetween freedom and order; the concept of “community.” The \npromise here is not that support of the arts and the humanities will \nbring a consensus on these difficult issues, but rather that study of \nthese subjects will challenge us to remember these issues, and \nincrease our capacity to discuss and even to differ on them \nreasonably rather than violently. \n \nMy point is a simple one: The arts and the humanities are not frills, \nbut are crucial to our Nation’s survival and continued freedom.2 \n \n1 Willem B. Drees, What Are the Humanities For? 121 (2021). \n2 114 Cong. Rec. 4322 (Feb. 27, 1968). \nPAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 5 of 81\nRepresentative Ford’s words still resonate today. Federal funding for the arts and \nhumanities has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades, with Congress continuing to strengthen \nthe statutes governing NEH and provide stable funding generation after generation. The 2024 \nand 2025 appropriations were no different, with Congress allocating $207 million each year to \nthe humanities. \nOne of the “most direct and significant benefits” to Congress of the NEH structure is the \n“Federal/State Partnership,” under which NEH provides grants to state and other jurisdictions in \nthe United States, which then spend that money within their jurisdictions on local humanities \nprojects.3 In creating this structure, Congress specifically recognized the importance of \n“guaranteeing the stability and assurance of federal funding” while “in no way dictat[ing] what \ntype of organization is to carry out the programs.”4 Congress, however, set out a list of priorities \nthat NEH in its funding, and the Federal/State Partnership in its funding, must follow. These \ninclude “the research and teaching potential of the United States in the humanities”; programs \n“that reach, or reflect the diversity and richness of our American cultural heritage, including the \nculture of, a minority, inner city, rural, or tribal community”; “international programs and \nexchanges”; “scholarly works in the humanities”; programs that “would otherwise be unavailable \ndue to geographic or economic reasons”; and in all selections giving “particular regard to \nscholars, and educational and cultural institutions, that have traditionally been \nunderrepresented.”5 \n \n3 H.R. Rep. No. 93-255, at 17 (June 5, 1973). \n4 122 Cong. Rec. 11091 (Apr. 26, 1976). \n5 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). \nPAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 6 of 81\nShortly after President Trump took office for his second term in 2025, NEH reviewed all \nopen NEH Federal/State Partnership grants for whether they might involve subjects such as \n“diversity, equity, inclusion, and accommodation,” or “environmental justice.” On April 2, 2025, \nNEH, in consultation with the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”), \nbut without providing any notice or opportunity to be heard, terminated the open grants in the \nFederal/State Partnership. DOGE also spearheaded the termination of more than 65 percent of \nNEH staff and a complete restructuring of the agency. After this lawsuit was filed, NEH partially \nrescinded the terminations of grants that were not in their final two-year “closeout” period. This \nsudden revocation of funding caused significant upheaval in all states and jurisdictions that have \notherwise enjoyed the stable humanities funding created by Congress 50 years ago. From the \nlargest cities to the most rural communities throughout our nation, humanities projects came to a \nscreeching halt. \nThe two plaintiffs in this lawsuit are the Oregon Council for the Humanities, doing \nbusiness as Oregon Humanities, and the Federation of State Humanities Councils. Plaintiffs \nallege that Defendants, as members of the Executive Branch, violated the U.S. Constitution and \nfederal statutes in unilaterally refusing to spend congressionally appropriated funds as directed \nby statute. Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction and a stay under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”) on their claims under the Separations of Powers doctrine, the \nImpoundment Control Act (“ICA”), and the APA. For the reasons explained below, the Court \ngrants Plaintiffs’ motion and enters a preliminary injunction and stay.  \nSTANDARDS  \nA.  Preliminary Injunction \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nPAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 7 of 81\nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction generally must show \nthat: (1) the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) the plaintiff is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in favor of \nthe plaintiff; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest. Id. at 20 (rejecting the Ninth \nCircuit’s earlier rule that the mere “possibility” of irreparable harm, as opposed to its likelihood, \nwas sufficient, in some circumstances, to justify a preliminary injunction). \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, however, did not disturb the Ninth Circuit’s \nalternative “serious questions” test. See All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, \n1131-32 (9th Cir. 2011). Under this test, “a preliminary injunction may issue where ‘serious \nquestions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in plaintiff’s \nfavor’ if the plaintiff ‘also shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the \ninjunction is in the public interest.’” Planned Parenthood Great Nw., Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, \nKentucky v. Labrador, 122 F.4th 825, 844 (9th Cir. 2024) (quoting All. for the Wild Rockies, 632 \nF.3d at 1135). The Ninth Circuit also has a “‘sliding scale’ approach, in which ‘the elements of \nthe preliminary injunction test are balanced, so that a stronger showing of one element may \noffset a weaker showing of another.’” Id. (quoting All. for the Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1131).6 \nB.  Stay Under the APA \n“[T]he factors used to determine whether to issue a § 705 stay under the APA are the \nsame equitable factors used to consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction.” Immigr. Defs. \nLaw Ctr. v. Noem, --- F.4th ----, 2025 WL 2080742, at *15 (9th Cir. July 18, 2025) (first citing \nColorado v. EPA, 989 F.3d 874, 883 (10th Cir. 2021); and then citing Cook County v. Wolf, 962 \n \n6 At oral argument, Plaintiffs withdrew their request for relief that could be construed as a \nmandatory injunction. Thus, the Court does not discuss the different standards between a \nmandatory and prohibitory injunction. \nPAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 8 of 81\nF.3d 208, 221 (7th Cir. 2020)). Such a stay serves to “postpone the effective date of an agency \naction” or “preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 705. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Framework \nThe National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 19657 and its progeny \n(the “Act”) created the National Endowment for the Arts (“NEA”) and NEH. In establishing \nthese two agencies, and in later amendments, Congress made specific findings emphasizing the \npurpose of the Act, including, among other things, that:  \n(1) The arts and the humanities belong to all the people of the \nUnited States.  \n(2) The encouragement and support of national progress and \nscholarship in the humanities and the arts . . . are also appropriate \nmatters of concern to the Federal Government. \n(3) An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science \nand technology alone, but must give full value and support to the \nother great branches of scholarly and cultural activity . . . . \n(4) Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens.

Id. § 956(b)(1). The Act also created a \nNational Council on the Humanities (“National Council”). Id. § 956(c). The Chairperson, with \nthe advice of the National Council, is authorized to make “contracts, grants, loans, and other \nforms of assistance” to:  \n(1) develop and encourage the pursuit of a national policy for the \npromotion of progress and scholarship in the humanities;  \n(2) initiate and support research and programs to strengthen the \nresearch and teaching potential of the United States in the \nhumanities by making arrangements with individuals or groups to \nsupport such activities . . . ; \nPAGE 9 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 10 of 81\n(3) initiate and support training and workshops in the humanities \nby making arrangements with institutions or individuals . . . ;  \n(4) initiate and support programs and research which have \nsubstantial scholarly and cultural significance and that reach, or \nreflect the diversity and richness of our American cultural heritage, \nincluding the culture of, a minority, inner city, rural, or tribal \ncommunity;  \n(5) foster international programs and exchanges;  \n(6) foster the interchange of information in the humanities;  \n(7) foster, with groups, education in, and public understanding and \nappreciation of the humanities;  \n(8) support the publication of scholarly works in the humanities;  \n(9) insure that the benefit of its programs will also be available to \nour citizens where such programs would otherwise be unavailable \ndue to geographic or economic reasons; and  \n(10) foster programs and projects that provide access to, and \npreserve materials important to research, education, and public \nunderstanding of, the humanities.  \nId. Congress instructed that “the Chairperson shall give particular regard to scholars, and \neducational and cultural institutions, that have traditionally been underrepresented.” Id. Congress \nalso required the Chairperson to “coordinate” new federal humanities programs, “insofar as \npracticable,” with existing federal, state, and private programs and “with due regard to the \ncontribution to the objectives” set forth in § 956(c). Id. § 956(d). \nTo help realize its goal of increasing humanities access, education, and funding, the Act \ncontains, in addition to the creation of the position of Chairperson and the National Council, a \nframework under which the states and other jurisdictions work in partnership with the federal \nagency to facilitate the distribution of federal funding (the “Federal/State Partnership”).8 20 \n \n8 Other “jurisdictions” include Washington, D.C., American Samoa, Puerto Rico, \nNorthern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 952(g). For \nPAGE 10 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 11 of 81\nU.S.C. § 956(f). Congress first directed that NEH must “carry out a program of grants-in-aid” \nand must do so “in such a manner as will furnish adequate programs in the humanities in each of \nthe several States.” Id. § 956(f)(1). The State partner could create an administrative agency. See \nid. § 956(f)(2)(A). Alternatively, the State could create a nonprofit humanities council \n(“Council”). Id. § 956(f)(2)(B). Under that scenario, no more than 25 percent of the board \nmembers of the Council could be appointed by an officer or agency of the State. See id. Fifty-six \njurisdictional partners, including all States involved in this litigation, chose the latter option (i.e., \nthe Council option). Decl. of Phoebe Stein (ECF 20) ¶ 4. Further, all but one of these Councils \nare members of Plaintiff Federation of State Humanities Councils (“Federation”). 9 Id. No federal \n“department, agency, officer, or employee” is permitted to “exercise any direction, supervision, \nor control over the policy determination, personnel, or curriculum, or the administration or \noperation of any school or other non-Federal agency, institution, organization, or association” in \nthe administration of NEA or NEH programs or funding. 20 U.S.C. § 953(c). \nTo obtain federal funding, Councils submit to NEH applications, along with a plan. Id. \n§ 956(f)(3). Congressionally appropriated funds to the Federal/State Partnership are allocated for \neach fiscal year as follows: \n•  First, a minimum of $200,000 to each approved plan—if there are not enough \nappropriated funds to pay $200,000 to each approved plan, then equal sums shall \nbe allocated to each plan. Id. § 956(f)(4); \n•  Second, if there are excess funds after paying $200,000 to each approved plan, it \nis to be divided three ways:  \n \nsimplicity, in this Opinion and Order the Court refers to “State” as an all-inclusive term \nencompassing both states and these other U.S. jurisdictions. \n9 Although Oregon’s Council is the only state-specific Council named as a Plaintiff in \nthis lawsuit, representatives from other state Councils have submitted declarations. See ECF 9, \n10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. In this lawsuit, they are all represented by the Plaintiff Federation. \nPAGE 11 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 12 of 81\no  Thirty-four percent “of such excess for such fiscal year shall be available \nto the Chairperson for making grants . . . to States and regional groups and \nentities applying for such grants.” Id. § 956(f)(4)(A); \no  Forty-four percent “of such excess for such fiscal year shall be allotted in \nequal amounts among the States and grant recipients which have plans \napproved by the Chairperson.” Id. § 956(f)(4)(B) (emphasis added); and \no  Twenty-two percent of the “excess for such fiscal year shall be allotted \namong the States and grant recipients which have plans approved” based \non population. Id. § 956(f)(4)(C) (emphasis added). \nCongress added this allocation formula to the statutory framework in 1980. See Arts and \nHumanities Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-496, § 104, 94 Stat. 2583, 2586 (codified at 20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(f)(4)). Before that, Congress had authorized NEH to distribute appropriated funds 75 \npercent equally among States and 25 percent at the Chairperson’s discretion. See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(f) (1976). The formula added in 1980, giving the Chairperson discretion for 34 percent of \nthe excess of appropriated federal-state funds, was a compromise between the dueling requests at \nthe time—the administration’s request of discretion for 50 percent of the total of Federal/State \nPartnership appropriated funds and the Councils’ request of discretion for only 10 percent of the \ntotal funds. See 126 Cong. Rec. 29951 (Nov. 17, 1980). Congress at the time performed the \narithmetic, calculating the excess above $200,000 for each State versus total appropriated \namounts under various formulas and what would be left for discretionary authority. Id. The \namendment deliberately “reduces the Chair[person]’s discretionary share but not as much as the \nstate humanities councils would (17 percent rather than 10 percent of the total state funds).” Id. \nThus, although the Chairperson had discretion for 34 percent of the excess funds, that equated \nto 17 percent of the total appropriated funds for the Federal/State Partnership. \nThe Federal/State Partnership legislation also includes a general provision allowing NEH \nto reallocate funds that are not awarded in a fiscal year: “All amounts allotted or made available \nunder paragraph (4) for a fiscal year which are not granted to any entity during such fiscal year \nPAGE 12 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 13 of 81\nshall be available to the National Endowment for the Humanities for the purpose of carrying out \nsubsection (c).” 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(6).  \nThis text is taken from current § 954(g)(5), which originally was § 954(h)(5) of NEA’s \ngoverning statute. When Congress amended this provision in the NEA governing statute to the \ncurrent text, which was later added to NEH’s governing statute, Congress explained the \namendment as follows: \nIt also amends section 5(h)(5) of the public law to permit the \nNational Endowment for the Arts to use amounts remaining after \ngrants are made to the States for general program purposes. Thus, \nany amounts allotted to the States which the States do not use may \nbe used by the Endowment to support, for example, regional arts \nprograms or other programs within the States. The amounts \ninvolved here are very small—$12,000 last fiscal year. Clearly, it \nis administratively not practical to divide such a small amount \namong all the States. \n114 Cong. Rec. 4320 (Feb. 27, 1968); see also H.R. Rep. No. 93-529, at 9 (1973) (explaining the \nprovision as establishing that funds available to the States but “not used by the States” would \n“revert” to the Chairperson for use under the general authorization). \nRegarding congressional appropriations, the first iteration of the statute included specific \nappropriation authorizations. The original version of the statute authorized appropriations to \nsupport the general mission of NEA and NEH; appropriations in the amount of matching funds \nfor donations, up to a capped total; appropriations to support existing grants; and appropriations \nto support administrative costs. See Pub. L. No. 89-209, § 11, 79 Stat. 845, 853-54 (1965) \n(codified at 20 U.S.C. § 960). In 1973, Congress recognized the importance of the Federal/State \nPartnership contained within the NEA statute. See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 93-255, at 17 (1973) \n(“Indeed, one of the most direct and significant benefits arising from the establishment of the \nNational Endowment of the Arts is the State arts agency program.”). Thus, Congress increased \nthe minimum NEA per-State grant in 1973 from $65,000 to $200,000, id., and added “safeguard \nPAGE 13 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 14 of 81\nlanguage” to ensure that “no less than 20 percent shall be allotted to the States in equal \namounts.” Id.; see also National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Amendments \nof 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-133, § 2, 87 Stat. 461, 463, 465 (1973).  \nIn 1976, Congress added the Federal/State Partnership provisions to the NEH statute. See, \ne.g., 20 U.S.C. § 956(f) (1976). Before then, many States had “voluntary organizations” working \nin that capacity, and the 1976 amendment was intended to allow flexibility for those \norganizations to remain or for a more formal State agency to be created. See 122 Cong. \nRec. 11091 (Apr. 26, 1976). The bill’s sponsor explained that it “builds solidly on the \nachievements on existing State arts and humanities programs and adds new incentives for \nhumanities programs by assuring them of yearly funding.” Id. at 11092. He noted that the \namendment had “impressive bipartisan support, having been reported out of the subcommittee \nwith no dissenting votes and out of the Committee on Education and Labor by a vote of 29 to 0.” \nId. He emphasized that the “assurance of a minimum of Federal funds available to States” was \nadded to “provide the State programs a greater degree of stability.” Id. at 11091. The sponsor \nexplained that the bill “would give the guaranteed 20 percent or $200,000 per State . . . to the \nhumanities councils” to “guarantee[] the stability and assurance of Federal funds to carry out \nhumanities programs in each State.” Id.; see also id. at 11090 (explaining that the funding for the \nFederal/State Partnership would be “at least $200,000 for each State program, or 20 percent of \nall humanities endowment moneys”). The appropriations authorization provision thus was \namended to add a minimum carve-out for NEH (the same as NEA) that not less than 20 percent \nof all sums appropriated shall be for the respective Federal/State Partnerships. See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 960(a)(1)(B) (1976). Appropriations authorizations remained for other categories, such as \nadministrative costs, existing grants, matching grants, and so forth. \nPAGE 14 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 15 of 81\nFuture amendments updated the dollar amounts specifically appropriated but did not \nmaterially change the concept of how the agencies overall or the Federal/State Partnerships \nspecifically were funded. For example, the 1990 amendment to § 960, the current iteration of that \nprovision, authorized the following appropriations for the NEA Federal/State Partnership: “For \nthe purpose of carrying out section 954(c) of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated to \nthe National Endowment for the Arts $125,800,000 for fiscal year 1991 and such sums as may be \nnecessary for fiscal years 1992 and 1993” and required that “not less than 25 percent of the \namount appropriated for the respective fiscal year” for 1991 and 1992 and “not less than 27.5 \npercent” for 1993 “shall be for carrying out section 954(g) of this title.” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 960(a)(1)(A)(i)-(ii). For the NEH Federal/State Partnership, the statute provides:  \nFor the purpose of carrying out section 956(c) of this title, there are \nauthorized to be appropriated to the National Endowment for the \nHumanities $119,900,000 for fiscal year 1991 and such sums as \nmay be necessary for fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Of the sums so \nappropriated for any fiscal year, not less than 20 per centum shall \nbe for carrying out section 956(f) of this title. \nId. § 960(a)(1)(B). Each appropriations bill or continuing resolution since has allocated updated \ndollar amounts. \nIn the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 (“2024 Appropriations Act”), Congress \nappropriated $207,000,000 to NEH, “of which $192,000,000 shall be available for support of \nactivities in the humanities, pursuant to [20 U.S.C. § 956(c)] and for administering the functions \nof the Act.” Pub. L. No. 118-42, § 6, 138 Stat. 25, 281 (2024). Congress stated in the 2024 \nAppropriations Act that the joint explanatory statement, printed in the Senate report in the \nCongressional Record, “shall have the same effect with respect to the allocation of funds and \nimplementation of divisions A through F of this Act as if it were a joint explanatory statement of \na committee of conference.” 138 Stat. 26. \nPAGE 15 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 16 of 81\nIn the joint explanatory statement, at the start of the section governing NEH funding, \nCongress stated: \nThe joint explanatory statement accompanying this division is \napproved and indicates congressional intent. . . .  \nEach department and agency funded in this Act is directed to \nfollow the directions set forth in this Act and the accompanying \nstatement and to not reallocate resources or reorganize activities \nexcept as provided herein or otherwise approved by the House and \nSenate Appropriations Committees through the reprogramming \nprocess as referenced in this Act. This joint explanatory statement \naddresses only those agencies and accounts for which there is a \nneed for greater explanation than provided in the Act itself. \nFunding levels for appropriations by account, program, and \nactivity, with comparisons to the fiscal year 2023 enacted level and \nthe fiscal year 2024 budget request, can be found in the table at the \nend of this division.  \n170 Cong. Rec. S1675 (daily ed. Mar. 5, 2024). In the table attached to the joint explanatory \nstatement, Congress appropriated $65 million for the Federal/State Partnership for NEH (the \nsame as the 2023 funding level). See id. at S1859 (chart of appropriations for 2023 and 2024 for \nNEH Federal/State Partnership).10 The continuing resolution signed by President Trump on \nMarch 15, 2025 (“2025 CR”), carried over the same funding levels for NEH as were found in \nthe 2024 Appropriations Act. See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 119-4, §§ 1101(a)(7), (c), 139 Stat. 9, 11-12 \n(2025). \nB.  Factual Background \n1.  NEH, DOGE, and the Changes to NEH in Spring 2025 \nAs noted, NEH is a federal agency, established under the Act. Before changes made in \nApril 2025, many NEH employees had significant specialized expertise, including master’s \n \n10 This differs from the specific allocation to the NEA Federal/State Partnership, which \nincreased in 2024 to $65,180,000 from $64,980,000 in 2023.

Decl. of Jane Doe (ECF 12) ¶ 22. Also \nbefore April 2025, NEH had engaged in a rigorous grant review process, as recently described by \nU.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in the Southern District of New York: \nBefore April 2025, the NEH engaged in a rigorous process for \nselecting grantees among the many thousands of applicants it \nreceives annually. Each year, the NEH recruits and organizes \nover 1,000 individual experts into more than 200 peer review \npanels to review each of the more than 5,500 grant applications the \nNEH receives annually. \nPeer review panels were organized and overseen by NEH program \nofficers, who themselves were experts in the areas of scholarship \nfor which they were asked to review grant applications. Program \nofficers placed experts on review panels based on a variety of \nfactors, including broad knowledge of the humanities and expertise \nin specific areas. \nAfter a grant application was submitted, a relevant program officer \nreviewed it and, based on academic discipline, institutional type, \nproject area, or project type, assigned it to a specific peer-review \npanel for the relevant program. Each grant application thus \nreceived rigorous review by experts in the applicant’s field. \nAm. Council of Learned Soc’ys v. McDonald, 2025 WL 2097738, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2025) \n(citations omitted). \nNEH primarily funds Councils through general operating support grants. Councils submit \napplications and plans, and NEH notifies the recipient of the grant award with a “Notice of \nAction” through a computer system called “eGMS.” Stein Decl. ¶ 9. Funds are then supplied in \none of two ways. Id. ¶ 10. Some expenses may be paid in advance. Most expenses, however, are \nprepaid by Councils, which then ask NEH for reimbursement under the general operating support \ngrant. Id. Until changes that occurred in April 2025, NEH had rapidly processed and paid such \nreimbursements because the outlay of money already had been allowed with the plan approval. \nSee id. \nPAGE 17 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 18 of 81\nNEH also provides special initiative funding. See id. ¶ 11. This funding includes the \nChair’s Grants on special projects that NEH offers to one or more Councils or special projects \nthat Councils request from NEH themselves, such as responding to climate disasters or hate-\nfueled violence. See id. Councils may or may not submit an application and plan in response to a \nspecial initiative project announced by the Chair. \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump established DOGE as a component of the \nExecutive Office of the President. Exec. Ord. No. 14158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 20, 2025). \nEach federal agency was required to work with at least four DOGE team members, who would \n“advise their respective Agency Heads on implementing the President’s DOGE Agenda.” Id. On \nFebruary 26, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order further implementing DOGE. \nExec. Ord. No. 14222, 90 Fed. Reg. 11095 (Feb. 26, 2025). This Executive Order instructed \nagencies to consult with DOGE and “where appropriate and consistent with applicable law, \nterminate or modify” contracts and grants. Id. at 11095-96. \nOn January 21, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order rescinding previous \nExecutive Orders issued during the past 50 years that encouraged or established policies or \npreferences for diversity, equity or inclusion; disability accommodation; environmental justice in \nminority and low-income populations; and equal employment opportunity. Exec. Ord. \nNo. 14173, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, 2025). Shortly thereafter, NEH employees were \ninstructed to examine every open grant since 2021, when President Biden took office, and \ndetermine whether the grant ran afoul of Executive Orders issued by President Trump. Decl. of \nMary Doe (ECF 13) ¶ 3.

Ord. No. 14210, 90 F.R. 9669 \n(Feb. 11, 2025). The President instructed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n(“OMB”) to reduce the size of the federal workforce, including through “large-scale reductions \nin force” (“RIF”), which were required to be “consistent with applicable law.” Id. at 9670. NEH \nfirst submitted a plan to reduce the number of its employees by 20-25 percent. Jane Doe Decl. \n¶ 8. On March 28, 2025, DOGE met with agency directors and recommended a RIF of at least 70 \npercent of NEH staff. Id. ¶ 11. During the week of March 24, 2025, NEH senior leadership had \n \n11 Michael McDonald, Acting Director of NEH, submitted a declaration in this case. \nECF 32. His declaration does not describe the process by which NEH employees reviewed grants \nfor termination. Instead, he summarily states that beginning in “early April 2025,” he engaged in \nan individualized review with DOGE and terminated grants pursuant to Executive Order \nNo. 14222. Id. ¶ 8 & n.1. In a case before the Northern District of California, however, \nMcDonald submitted a more detailed declaration, describing how NEH staff were tasked in the \nfirst week of the Trump administration with reviewing all open grants to see if they violated any \nof three Executive Orders issued by President Trump on January 20-21, 2025, and how \nbeginning on February 7, 2025, staff created spreadsheets to mark projects funded during the \nBiden Administration. See ECF 35-3, Reply Decl. of Anna Sortun, Ex. C (Decl. of Michael \nMcDonald filed in Thakur v. Trump, No. 25-cv-04737-RFL, ECF 48-3 (N.D. Cal. June 19, \n2025)). McDonald’s description from his declaration in Thakur comports with the description of \nMary Doe in her declaration filed in this case. This process was also described in the \nspreadsheets for at least the federal programs produced in American Council. See 2025 \nWL 2097738, at *10-11 (“These spreadsheets confirm that agency officials flagged grants for \ntermination based on their ostensible connection to the study of ‘DEI,’ ‘gender ideology,’ or \n‘environmental justice.’”). Ultimately, as explained in American Council, “nearly all” federal \ngrants awarded under the Biden Administration were terminated. Id. at *11. The review process \nto see if grants violated President Trump’s Executive Orders, however, began well before \nExecutive Order No. 14222 was issued on February 26, 2025. And it strains credulity that a \nreview of all open Federal/State Partnership grants could begin in “early April” and finish in \ntime for mass termination letters to be drafted and sent on April 2nd. At this stage of the \nlitigation, the Court does not find persuasive that the grant terminations in this case were done on \nan individualized basis, in early April, pursuant to Executive Order No. 14222. \nPAGE 19 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 20 of 81\nalso begun notifying NEH program directors about grants that were being terminated.

The attached \ntermination letter stated: \nThis letter provides notice that the National Endowment for the \nHumanities (NEH) is terminating your federal grant (Grant \nApplication No. SO28986523) effective April 2, 2025, in \naccordance with the termination clause in your Grant Agreement. \n \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities \nand conditions of the Grant Agreement and is subject to \ntermination due to several reasonable causes, as outlined in 2 CFR \n§ 200.340. NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in \nlight of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations \nin a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda. The \nPresident’s February 19, 2025 executive order mandates that the \nNEH eliminate all non-statutorily required activities and functions. \nSee Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy, \nPAGE 20 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 21 of 81\nE.O. 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate termination of \nnecessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, \nincluding its fiscal priorities. The termination of your grant \nrepresents an urgent priority for the administration, and due to \nexceptional circumstances, adherence to the traditional notification \nprocess is not possible. Therefore, the NEH hereby terminates your \ngrant in its entirety effective April 2, 2025. \nId.12 The termination letter was followed with an email on April 30, 2025, from the NEH Office \nof Grant Management. This email attached “Guidance for Recipients of Terminated NEH \nAwards.” Id. ¶ 12, Ex. B. It provided instructions on how to submit for reimbursement of \n“allowable and allocable costs incurred prior to the termination notice,” requiring that those costs \nbe “reasonable,” and how to request “termination and closeout costs.” Id. Ex. B at 3-7. NEH also \nstated under the heading “Appeals” that it “is not offering a means of dispute resolution.” Id. \nat 10. \nOn April 3, 2025, Assistant Chair for Programs Adam Wolfson emailed division directors \nin NEH, stating: “In the event you or your staff receive inquiries from grantees about the \ntermination of their awards, you should respond that the reasons for the termination are set out in \nthe communications that the grantees received and that you [meaning you or your staff] can \nprovide no additional information. Program staff should simply leave it at that.” Jane Doe \nDecl. ¶ 14 (brackets in original). \nIn the evening of April 3, 2025, NEH staff began receiving notices that they were placed \non administrative leave. An NEH staff member and officer of the American Federation of \nGovernment Employees Local 3403 (“Union”) estimates that 105 of the employees were placed \non leave and 72 were not. Id. ¶ 16. On April 9th, McDonald sent a memorandum to staff stating \n \n12 In his declaration filed in this case, McDonald stated that this notice mistakenly \nreferenced Executive Order No. 14217, when it should have referenced Executive Order \nNo. 14222.

On April 10th, the Union received a RIF notice that 116 positions, including 91 in \nthe collective bargaining unit, were being eliminated, representing nearly 65 percent of staff. Id. \n¶ 18, Ex. 3. The new structure of NEH collapses the original eight programs offices (Office of \nChallenge Programs, Office of Data and Evaluation, Office of Digital Humanities, Division of \nEducation Programs, Office of Federal/State Partnership, Division of Preservation and Access, \nDivision of Public Programs, and Division of Research Programs) into four—Office of \nFederal/State Partnership, Infrastructure, Lifelong Learning, and Research. Id. ¶ 20, Ex. 1 at 24. \nThe director of the Federal/State Program office was terminated effective June 6, 2025, leaving \nthe position vacant. Mary Doe Decl. ¶ 7. \nThe significant staff cuts have eliminated most of the highly specialized and \nknowledgeable staff at NEH, eroding the highly skilled workforce that enabled NEH to perform \nits statutory duties. Jane Doe Decl. ¶¶ 21-22. The cuts also have left only six employees in the \nOffice of Grant Management and five employees in accounting, making it virtually impossible \nfor NEH to perform its statutorily required role rigorously to review more than one hundred \nmillion dollars in federal grants and oversee tens of millions of dollars in Federal/State \nPartnership grants. Id.  \nOn April 24, 2025, NEH issued a press release. McDonald Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. C. The release \nstated that NEH had taken steps to “eliminate offices that are not essential to fulfilling its \nstatutory requirements,” to “return to being a responsible steward of taxpayer funds,” and to \nensure that awards are “merit-based” and not based on “extreme ideologies based on race or \ngender.” Id., Ex. C at 1-2. The release also contained a statement of “priorities.”  \nPAGE 22 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 23 of 81\nThese priorities, however, do not include the priorities mandated by Congress, including \ninitiating and supporting programs that “reach, or reflect the diversity and richness of our \nAmerican cultural heritage, including the culture of, a minority, inner city, rural, or tribal \ncommunity” (§ 956(c)(4)); “foster international programs and exchanges” (§ 956(c)(5)); “insure \nthat the benefit of its programs will also be available to our citizens where such programs would \notherwise be unavailable due to geographic or economic reasons” (§ 956(c)(9)); and in all \nprograms “give particular regard to scholars, and educational and cultural institutions, that have \ntraditionally been underrepresented” (§ 956(c)). Instead, the changes made by NEH to comply \nwith President Trump’s Executive Orders relating to diversity, equity, inclusion, \naccommodation, and environmental justice directly contradict Congress’s repeated and explicit \ninstruction in the NEH statute expressly to consider such factors when evaluating grant awards. \nOn May 8, 2025, NEH announced awards of $9.5 million in new grants. Id. ¶ 15, Ex. D. It is \nunclear which of those are direct federal grants and which, if any, are through the Federal/State \nPartnership. \nOn May 15, 2025, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit. On June 2, 2025, NEH sent email notices \nregarding 55 of the 79 general operating support grants that were terminated in April, informing \nthe States that the fiscal year 2025 general operating supporting grant terminations were \nrescinded up to 20 percent. See, e.g., McDonald Decl. ¶¶ 16-17 (explaining that the rescission \ninvolved only 55 grants); Davis Decl. Ex. C (Oregon rescission letter); Stein Decl. Ex. C \n(Wyoming rescission letter). The email explained: “For fiscal year 2025, the agency is funding \nthe humanities councils at 20 percent of its appropriation of program funds, which is the \nminimum that NEH is congressionally mandated to award to our state and jurisdictional \nhumanities council partners [20 U.S. Code § 960 – Authorization of appropriations, 1 B].” Davis \nPAGE 23 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 24 of 81\nDecl. Ex. C (brackets in original). The email notified recipients to watch for an official \nnotification. The email also observed that “the reduction in funds from 40 percent to 20 percent \nstill represents an incredible hardship.” Id. NEH rescinded a portion of the termination for the 55 \ngrants that were in an active period—the remaining 24 grants were in their “closeout” period and \nso they were left terminated and simply not “reinstate[d].” McDonald Decl. ¶ 17. That same day, \nNEH sent a second email notice. See, e.g., Davis Decl. Ex. D. This email attached a notice \nrescinding the termination from April 2nd and reinstating funding at the 20 percent level that the \nagency believed was its only statutory obligation. Id.  \nOn July 18, 2025, the National Council met and moved to approve Federal/State \nPartnership plans for general operating support grants for the 2026 fiscal year. See ECF 37-1. \nMcDonald approved this motion on July 25th. Id. Funding is contingent on 2026 appropriations \nand NEH’s interpretation of the Chairperson’s “discretionary authority.” Id. On August 1, 2025, \nNEH issued a press release announcing $34.79 million in humanities grant funding. See \nECF 37-2. These appear all to be direct federal grants. None of this activity is relevant to the \npending motion, which involves Federal/State Partnership grants for approved plans under 2024 \nand 2025 appropriations funding. \n2.  Councils \nPlaintiff Oregon Humanities is the Oregon side of the Federal/State Partnership under the \nAct. Oregon Humanities distributes NEH funds in communities throughout Oregon. Davis Decl. \n¶ 3. These funds support projects such as rural libraries in Burns, Forest Grove, Blue River, \nNewport, and Joseph; youth-led conversations about mental health in Medford; storytelling \nprojects led by Nez Perce Wallowa Homeland; publication of Oregon Humanities magazine; \nproduction of audio programs The Detour and This Place, airing on local radio and podcast \nPAGE 24 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 25 of 81\nplatforms; community conversation programs held in libraries, community colleges, and cultural \ncenters; and free humanities courses for adults living near the poverty line. Id. ¶ 9. \nOregon Humanities was approved for a general operating support grant, spanning \nNovember 1, 2022 through October 31, 2027. Id. ¶ 6. It also was approved on January 22, 2025, \nfor a United We Stand special initiative grant of $40,000. It spent those awarded funds, but has \nnot yet been reimbursed. Id. ¶ 8. \nAs noted, Davis received the April 2nd termination email from McDonald, the follow-up \nemail on April 30th from the Office of Grant Management, and the June partial rescission emails \nrestoring some level of partial funding. Davis states that this level of funding allows Oregon \nHumanities to operate through October 2025, after much disruption, but that its ability to \ncontinue operations after October is in doubt. Id. ¶ 15. Because of the turmoil caused by DOGE \nand NEH, Oregon Humanities has cancelled programs in rural communities throughout the state, \ncanceled its own grants that it had planned to award throughout the state, cancelled a free \nsummer course for youth, laid off three staff members, and lost one staff position to attrition. Id. \n¶ 16. Oregon Humanities reduced its remaining staff by 50-80 percent and reduced benefits. Id. \nOregon Humanities had budgeted to award $175,000 in grants in 2025, but stopped all grant-\nmaking activities after receiving NEH’s termination notice. Id. ¶ 17. This includes Conexión \nFénix in Otis, Corvallis Multicultural Library, KXCJ-LP in Cave Junction, Natives of One Wind \nIndigenous Alliance/Red Earth Descendants in Ashland, Vanport Mosaic in Portland, and \nWallowa Land Trust in Enterprise.

Asmo Decl. ¶ 3. The state \nlegislature does not support OHC, even though millions of Ohioans live in communities that lack \nresources to support a vibrant cultural sector. Id. ¶ 5. Thus, reliable NEH funding is of particular \nimportance. The majority of NEH funding to OHC supports grants to local cultural and history \norganizations directly serving the public. Id. ¶ 6. After the April 2nd termination, OHC paused \nits grant program indefinitely, including to organizations that have relied on funding from OHC \nfor 50 years and organizations that were waiting for second payments on open grants. These \norganizations include, but are not limited to: four operating in Appalachia; Akron Children’s \n \n13 See Decl. of Rebecca Asmo, ECF 9. \n14 See Decl. of Jama Best, ECF 10. \n15 See Decl. of Brandon Johnson, ECF 14. \n16 See Decl. of Gabrielle Lyon, ECF 15. \n17 See Decl. of Christina Oey, ECF 16. \n18 See Decl. of Kameron Perez-Verdia, ECF 17. \n19 See Decl. of Stuart Rockoff, ECF 18. \nPAGE 26 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 27 of 81\nHospital Palliative Care Department; an organization serving incarcerated women; an \norganization serving women who escaped human trafficking; the National Underground Railroad \nFreedom Center; the Wood County Museum exhibition about World War II veterans; a \ndocumentary film project about the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, the only UNESCO World \nHeritage Site in Ohio; and a public exhibition about Judaism in Ohio at Temple Israel Akron.

Instead, the pending motion focuses only on Plaintiffs’ \nclaims that Defendants are violating the Separation of Powers doctrine, the APA, and the ICA.  \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1.  Separation of Powers \nPlaintiffs bring a claim asserting that Defendants’ conduct violates the Separation of \nPowers doctrine. Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed on this claim because \nDefendants’ conduct reflects a “deliberate decision to flout Congressional command and refuse \nto spend appropriated funds.”  \n“The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, \nnot the President.” City & Cnty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause), U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending \nClause)). Congress also has the power to legislate. U.S. Const. art. I, § 1; see also id. art. I, § 8, \ncl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause). “There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes \nthe President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 \nU.S. 417, 438 (1998). Instead, the President “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully \nPAGE 29 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 30 of 81\nexecuted.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3 (Take Care Clause). “The Separation of Powers was an integral \npart of the Founders’ design.” City & Cnty. of S.F., 897 F.3d at 1232.  \nThe President’s authority to act “must stem either from an act of Congress or from the \nConstitution itself.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952). Courts \ngenerally look to the “tripartite” test stated in Justice Jackson’s Youngstown concurrence when \nconsidering a Separation of Powers claim. Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 10 \n(2015). This test provides that the President’s authority is at its maximum when acting pursuant \nto an express or implied authorization of Congress. Id. The second level of power is a “zone of \ntwilight” in the absence of either an express grant or denial of authority, where the President and \nCongress may have concurrent authority and “where congressional inertia, indifference or \nquiescence may invite the exercise of executive power.” Id. (quotation marks omitted). “Finally, \nwhen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress \nhe can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of \nCongress over the matter.” Id. (cleaned up). “Presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive \nand preclusive must be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibrium \nestablished by our constitutional system.” City & Cnty. of S.F., 897 F.3d at 1233 (quoting \nYoungstown, 343 U.S. at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring)). \n“[W]hen it comes to spending, the President has none of ‘his own constitutional powers’ \nto ‘rely’ upon.” Id. at 1233-34 (quoting Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring)). \n“Aside from the power of veto, the President is without authority to thwart congressional will by \ncanceling appropriations passed by Congress.” Id. at 1232. As then-Circuit Judge Kavanaugh \nexplained,  \na President sometimes has policy reasons . . . for wanting to spend \nless than the full amount appropriated by Congress for a particular \nPAGE 30 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 31 of 81\nproject or program. But in those circumstances, even the President \ndoes not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend the funds. \nInstead, the President must propose the rescission of funds, and \nCongress then may decide whether to approve a rescission bill.  \nIn re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Thus, “[a]bsent congressional \nauthorization, [an] Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds \nin order to effectuate its own policy goals.” City & Cnty. of S.F., 897 F.3d at 1235. An Executive \nOrder that so requires “violates the constitutional principle of the Separation of Powers.” Id. \nWhen an agency receives an “allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation,” \nhowever, that “is another administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency \ndiscretion.” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993). As the Supreme Court explained,  \na fundamental principle of appropriations law is that where \nCongress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without \nstatutorily restricting what can be done with those funds, a clear \ninference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding \nrestrictions, and indicia in committee reports and other legislative \nhistory as to how the funds should or are expected to be spent do \nnot establish any legal requirements on the agency. \nId. (quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court clarified that “an agency is not free simply to \ndisregard statutory responsibilities” and must “allocate[] funds from a lump-sum appropriation to \nmeet permissible statutory objectives.” Id. at 193. But otherwise “Congress may always \ncircumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative \nstatutes (though not, as we have seen, just in the legislative history).” Id.; see also Cmty. Legal \nServs. in E. Palo Alto v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 137 F.4th 932, 940-41 (9th \nCir. 2025) (discussing Lincoln and explaining that when Congress creates a mandatory program \nand directs certain activity, including through using the word “shall” in the statute, an agency \nmay not rely on lump-sum appropriations to disregard those statutory directives). \nPAGE 31 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 32 of 81\nWhether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Separation of Powers claim comes down \nto whether Congress circumscribed NEH’s discretion to spend its lump-sum appropriation in a \nstatute, either the NEH general governing statutes or the 2024 Appropriations Act (and its \nreaffirmance in the 2025 CR). Defendants admit that Congress has required that at least 20 \npercent of NEH’s overall funding go to the Federal/State Partnership, but Defendants argue that \nwith the June 2nd partial rescission of the April grant terminations, they are now complying with \nthat statutory directive. They contend that NEH has no other statutory directive but essentially \nhas unfettered discretion beyond that threshold funding requirement. \nPlaintiffs focus much of their argument on the contention that Congress appropriated $65 \nmillion to the Federal/State Partnership in the 2024 Appropriations Act and also in the 2025 CR. \nThat level of detailed appropriation, however, was in the table attached to the joint explanatory \nstatement. Although the joint explanatory statement and its attached table together are an \nunambiguous statement of congressional intent and Congress specifically directed agencies to \nabide by the table’s spending directives, they do not have the force of law. See, e.g., Laws.’ \nComm. for 9/11 Inquiry, Inc. v. Wray, 424 F. Supp. 3d 26, 30 (D.D.C. 2020), aff’d, 848 F. \nApp’x 428 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (declining to consider an explanatory statement in an appropriations \nbill as binding, noting that “Congress does not vote on a joint explanatory statement, so it ‘has no \nforce of law’ and functions as legislative history” (quoting Goldring v. District of Columbia, 416 \nF.3d 70, 75 & n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2005))); Adams & Assocs., Inc. v. United States, 120 Fed. Cl. 250, \n253 (2015) (explaining that the joint explanatory statement attached to the appropriations bill is \nlegislative history that does not have the force of law); cf. Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192-93. Thus, \nalthough the joint explanatory statement may be persuasive evidence of legislative intent, it does \nnot sustain a Separation of Powers claim. \nPAGE 32 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 33 of 81\nWhen specific portions of an appropriations bill incorporate by reference the explanatory \nstatement or an attached table, however, courts have found that binding. See, e.g., Widakuswara \nv. Lake (“Widakuswara I”), --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1166400, at *2 (D.D.C. Apr. 22, 2025) \n(relying on the relevant appropriation bill’s specific incorporation that funds appropriated shall \nbe allocated in accordance with the table attached to the explanatory statement); Widakuswara v. \nLake (“Widakuswara II”), 2025 WL 1288817, at *11 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2025) (Pillard, J., \ndissenting) (same, in the dissent adopted by an en banc decision), stay vacated 2025 \nWL 1521355 (D.C. Cir. May 28, 2025) (en banc) (“Widakuswara III”). Although other sections \nof the 2024 Appropriations Act incorporate by reference the joint explanatory statement and its \nattached table, see, e.g., 138 Stat. 27, 70, 126, the provision relating to NEH did not. That \nCongress knew how specifically to incorporate the 2024 Appropriations Act’s joint explanatory \nstatement and its table in specific funding provisions and did not do so with respect to NEH \nfunding shows that the $65 million appropriation is not binding. See Digit. Realty Tr., Inc. v. \nSomers, 583 U.S. 149, 161 (2018) (“When Congress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another, th[e] Court presumes that Congress intended a difference in \nmeaning.” (cleaned up)). Because Congress did not include the $65 million appropriation to the \nFederal/State Partnership in the 2024 Appropriations Act itself, Plaintiffs are not likely to \nsucceed on their Separation of Powers argument that Defendants are failing to comply with this \nspecific congressional spending directive.20 \n \n20 Plaintiffs argue both that Congress directed $65 million and 40 percent of the $192 \nmillion be spent on the Federal/State Partnership. The $65 million stems from the final number \nin the joint explanatory statement to the 2024 Appropriations Act. The 40 percent figure comes \nfrom an early House Committee on Appropriations bill recommendation on NEH funding, in \nwhich the committee recommended funding NEH at $186,300,000, with 40 percent going to the \nCouncils. See H.R. Rep. No. 118-155, at 100 (2023). Neither of those 2023 figures, however, are \nPAGE 33 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 34 of 81\nPlaintiffs, however, also assert in their motion that Defendants violated the Separation of \nPowers doctrine by refusing to spend appropriated funds. Also, in arguing in support of their \nAPA claims that Defendants’ conduct was contrary to the governing statutes, Plaintiffs contend \nthat Defendants violated the Separation of Powers doctrine by, among other things, failing to \ncomply with the formula stated in 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4). \nDefendants respond that NEH has broad discretion because its fiscal year appropriations \nremain available until obligated or expended and thus are not required to be spent in any given \nfiscal year. Defendants also assert that NEH does not have to spend funds under the carefully \ncrafted formula in 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4) because of the general residual clause in § 956(f)(6). \nDefendants’ argument, however, reads too much discretion into § 956(f)(6) and disregards the \nstatutory framework of the NEH governing statutes as a whole.  \nIn construing a statute, a court “must read the words in their context and with a view to \ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.” King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015) \n(quotation marks omitted); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts, 167-69 (2012) (hereinafter “Scalia & Garner”) (discussing the \n“Whole-Text Canon”). “Where the statute at issue is one that confers authority upon an \nadministrative agency, that inquiry must be shaped, at least in some measure, by the nature of the \nquestion presented—whether Congress in fact meant to confer the power the agency has \nasserted.” West Virginia v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022) (quotation marks \nomitted). “It is ‘a cardinal principle of statutory construction’ that ‘a statute ought, upon the \nwhole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be \n \nin the final 2024 Appropriations Act. Notably, the 40 percent figure also is referenced in NEH’s \npartial rescission notice. \nPAGE 34 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 35 of 81\nsuperfluous, void, or insignificant.’” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (quoting \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001)); see also Scalia & Garner, at 174-79 (discussing \nthe “Surplusage Canon”). A court may look to legislative intent by examining legislative history \nwhen a statute is ambiguous. Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 674 (2020) (citing Milner \nv. Dep’t of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 574 (2011)); see also Haro v. City of Los Angeles, 745 \nF.3d 1249, 1257 (9th Cir. 2014). \nDefendants’ interpretation of 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(6) is contrary to the plain text of the \nstatute read as a whole. The text of § 956(f)(4) provides a specific formula for allocating monies \nappropriated to the Federal/State Partnership to approved plans. Those are programs and projects \nalready approved by NEH. Additionally, § 956(f)(5) states: “The amount of each allotment to a \nState for any fiscal year under this subsection shall be available to each State or grant recipient, \nwhich has a plan or application approved by the Chairperson in effect on the first day of such \nfiscal year . . . .” (emphases added). A general residual clause allowing funds “which are not \ngranted to any entity” to revert to the Chairperson does not negate the express statutory text \nrequiring the Chairperson to distribute the funds to approved plans under an express formula and \nto make the funds available to States with approved plans on the first day of the fiscal year. \nDefendants’ interpretation of § 956(f)(6) also would render § 956(f)(4) superfluous. If \n§ 956(f)(6) allows NEH to forgo the formula required in § 956(f)(4), § 956(f)(4) would then \nserve no purpose.  \nIn addition, Defendants’ interpretation violates “the ‘well established canon of statutory \ninterpretation . . . that the specific governs the general,’ which applies especially where, as here, \n‘Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems \nwith specific solutions.’” United States v. Brumbaugh, 139 F.4th 1077, 1085 (9th Cir. 2025) \nPAGE 35 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 36 of 81\n(quoting RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012)) \n(alteration in Brumbaugh); see also Scalia & Garner, at 183-88 (discussing the \n“General/Specific Canon”). Congress deliberately solved the issue of how to divide appropriated \nfunds by carefully considering at the time competing requests from the States and the \nadministration. The general residual clause ensuring that monies appropriated to humanities but \nnot awarded and used would still be available for humanities projects does not override that \nspecific solution. \nFurther, viewing the statute as a whole, Congress placed importance on the Federal/State \nPartnership, States obtaining approval for plans, and States being able to rely on stable funding \nfor approved plans. Congress began by requiring that NEH provide grants to States and that the \nprogram “furnish adequate programs in the humanities in each of the several States.” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(f)(1) (emphasis added); see also Scalia & Garner, at 208 (noting that a law’s “evident \npurpose” helps define scope of a catchall provision). Congress even required that new federal \nprograms must, to the extent practicable, coordinate with existing State programs. Id. § 956(d). \nCongress expressly ensured that no federal “department, agency, officer, or employee” could \n“exercise any direction, supervision, or control” over State or private applicants or recipients of \nfunding. Id. § 953(c).  \nCongress also specifically provided for notice and an opportunity to be heard for grant \nrecipients before grant funding could be suspended or recaptured, and then limited such conduct \nto only enumerated reasons. Id. § 956(f)(7). As noted, Congress provided extra protection for \nStates whose plans were approved by the first day of the fiscal year, ensuring that their funding \n”shall” be available. Id. § 956(f)(5). Defendants’ reading of § 956(f)(6) as providing virtually \nPAGE 36 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 37 of 81\nunfettered discretion ignores the context of the statute as a whole, which repeatedly limits the \ndiscretion of the Chairperson with respect to the Federal/State Partnership. \nThe Chairperson also is not given much discretion in funding the Federal/State \nPartnership, with only a small amount of discretionary funding (34 percent of any excess in \nappropriations) allotted to the Chairperson. This framework, however, is not only to allow for \ndiscretionary funding, but more importantly, to allow for regional funding. When the text \ngranting the Chairperson discretion on the 25 percent of the full Federal/State Partnership \nappropriations first was added to the NEA provision in 1973, the emphasis was on allowing for \nfunding to regional groups to allow for projects that crossed state lines, particularly for “sparsely \npopulated states.” See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 93-255, at 3, 16 (1973). NEH funding provisions were \nmodeled after the NEA funding provisions when the Federal/State Partnership provisions were \nadded in 1976. Although this allocation is within the Chairperson’s discretion, it still must be \nawarded to States or regions and cannot be used for federal grants. \nEven if the statutory text could be considered ambiguous, the legislative intent, through \nthe legislative history, is clear that the discretion of the Chairperson is not unfettered. To the \ncontrary, Congress specifically intended to cabin the Chairperson’s discretion with respect to \nfunding the Federal/State Partnership so that the State humanities programs would have \nguaranteed funding. Indeed, as described above, when the formula of 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4) was \nadded in 1980, the discretionary authority of the Chairperson was reduced.  \nThus, the only reasonable interpretation of § 956(f)(6) is that Congress did not want any \nmoney going to waste, and included the residual clause to capture any funds in a fiscal year not \nused by the States. That also is how Congress described this same text in the context of the NEA \nstatutes. See 114 Cong. Rec. 4320 (Feb. 27, 1968); H.R. Rep. No. 93-529, at 9 (1973). Congress \nPAGE 37 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 38 of 81\nexplained that this clause was intended to catch the “very small” amount of funds allotted to \nstates that they did not use. 114 Cong. Rec. at 4320. Defendants offer an unreasonable \ninterpretation of this clause when they say that it may nullify the formula set forth in § 956(f)(4) \nor allow NEH not to spend funds otherwise expressly required by § 956(f), including the \ndirective in § 956(f)(1) to provide adequate State humanities programs or the directive in \n§ 956(f)(5) to make the funds available for plans approved as of the first day of the fiscal year. It \nalso does not nullify other statutory obligations, including how NEH may terminate a grant.  \nThis same statutory construction applies to § 960(b)(1) and the 2024 Appropriations \nAct’s allowance that appropriated funds remain available until spent. See § 960(b)(1) (stating \nthat funds appropriated “for any fiscal year shall remain available for obligation and expenditure \nuntil expended”); 138 Stat. 25, 281 (stating that funds will “remain available until expended”). \nThe appropriations bills essentially amend the dollar amounts appropriated in § 960(a)(1)(B). \nThese provisions must be evaluated in the context of the statute as a whole. The text states that \nthe funds are available until obligated or expended. When a Council’s plans are approved, \nhowever, the funds are obligated to that Council. See, e.g., § 956(f)(5). The statute sets forth in \n§ 956(f)(7) how NEH can suspend or recapture grants it has committed to a Council.  \nDefendants’ interpretation of the clause that funds need not be spent in a given year, \nalong with their interpretation of § 956(f)(6), also would have the absurd result that NEH could \nrefuse to fund any State programs in a given year, invoke the residual clause under § 956(f)(6), \nand then revert all appropriated funds to federal programs. That would violate specific \ncongressional directives to spend appropriated funds on the Federal/State Partnership. Congress \nsimply was providing an additional benefit to the Federal/State Partnership by allowing funds to \nPAGE 38 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 39 of 81\ncarry over if not spent, not allowing the administration to use that provision, in conjunction with \na nonsensical interpretation of § 956(f), to avoid following its statutory directives. \nAs the Supreme Court explained in Lincoln, even when there is a lump-sum \nappropriation, the agency must abide by its other statutory objectives and responsibilities. See \nLincoln, 508 U.S. at 193; see also Cmty. Legal Servs., 137 F.4th at 940. NEH states that it was \nfollowing the directive of presidential Executive Orders in terminating the grants. “Simply put, \n‘the President does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend the funds.’” City & Cnty. of \nS.F., 897 F.3d at 1232 (quoting Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 261 n.1). NEH’s contention that it \ndoes not have to follow Congress’s directive making funds available to States with approved \nfunds and allocating funds according to the formula established by Congress is a violation of the \nSeparation of Powers doctrine. The Executive Branch is not at liberty to rewrite a statute or \nunilaterally refuse to spend appropriated funds as directed. See United States v. McIntosh, 833 \nF.3d 1163, 1175 (9th Cir. 2016) (“The [Appropriations] Clause has a ‘fundamental and \ncomprehensive purpose . . . to assure that public funds will be spent according to the letter of the \ndifficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good and not according to the \nindividual favor of Government agents.’” (quoting Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 \nU.S. 414, 427-28 (1990)). \n2.  Impoundment Control Act  \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants violated the ICA, 2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq., by failing to \nfollow its required procedure for proposing a rescission or deferral of NEH’s appropriations. \nDefendants respond, and Plaintiffs concede in their reply, that the ICA forecloses a private right \nof action challenging executive impoundment decisions. The ICA states in relevant part:  \nIf, under this chapter, budget authority is required to be made \navailable for obligation and such budget authority is not made \navailable for obligation, the Comptroller General is hereby \nPAGE 39 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 40 of 81\nexpressly empowered, through attorneys of his own selection, to \nbring a civil action in the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia to require such budget authority to be made \navailable for obligation, and such court is hereby expressly \nempowered to enter in such civil action, against any department, \nagency, officer, or employee of the United States, any decree, \njudgment, or order which may be necessary or appropriate to make \nsuch budget authority available for obligation. \n2 U.S.C. § 687 (emphasis added).  \nAs the parties acknowledge, courts that have confronted the question of enforcement \nagree that the ICA provides that only the Comptroller General may bring suit directly to enforce \nthe ICA. See Rocky Ford Hous. Auth. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 427 F. Supp. 118, 134 \n(D.D.C. 1977) (“[T]he Court concludes, based on its examination of both the language and \nhistory of the statute, that Congress did not intend the [ICA] to create a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted to individuals . . . . Instead, Congress expressly provided that such suits could be \nbrought by the Comptroller General, and even he could bring such enforcement suits only after \nreceiving the tacit approval of Congress in each particular case.”); Pub. Citizen v. Stockman, 528 \nF. Supp. 824, 828-30 (D.D.C. 1981) (reviewing the legislative history of the ICA to conclude \nthat the plaintiffs had a “scant likelihood” of demonstrating an express or implied private right of \naction to enforce the ICA).21 Thus, the Court holds that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their claim brought directly under the ICA.22 \n \n21 The Court is aware of one case that evaluated the merits of an ICA challenge brought \nby a private party. See W. Cent. Mo. Rural Dev. Corp. v. Donovan, 659 F.2d 199 (D.C. \nCir. 1981). But there, the D.C. Circuit did not address standing and instead conducted a brief \nanalysis to conclude that the President’s conduct did not violate the ICA. See id. at 202-03. \nBecause Plaintiffs do not rely on this case or suggest that the Court should depart from the \ngenerally consistent conclusion that the ICA does not authorize a private right of action, the \nCourt does not discuss this case further.      \n22 The Court notes that in addition to a claim under the ICA, Plaintiffs also allege a \ngeneral ultra vires action against DOGE, in which they assert that DOGE acted without \nPAGE 40 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 41 of 81\nPlaintiffs also argue that nothing in the APA or the ICA prevents the Court from finding \nthat a government entity violated the APA by not complying with the ICA. Defendants dispute \nwhether the Court has jurisdiction under the APA to review this claim and argue that Plaintiffs \nare unlikely to succeed on the merits. The Court addresses these arguments next in its analysis of \nPlaintiff’s claims under the APA. \n3.  APA Claims \nPlaintiffs assert APA claims against all Defendants, alleging agency action contrary to \nlaw and arbitrary and capricious agency action. As an initial matter, DOGE is likely not an \n“agency” subject to the APA. Executive Order 14158, which created DOGE, expressly exempts \n“the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof” from the meaning of \n“agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551. See New Mexico v. Musk, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 \nWL 1502747, at *17 (D.D.C. May 27, 2025). Thus, Plaintiffs’ APA claims are likely not \nproperly asserted against DOGE and Gleason, and the Court considers these claims against only \nNEH, McDonald, and the National Council (hereinafter, the “NEH Defendants”). \na.  Jurisdiction \nDefendants argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA claims because: \n(1) the Tucker Act gives the Court of Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction over this type of \naction; (2) the ICA precludes review of Plaintiffs’ ICA-based APA claim; (3) Plaintiffs do not \nchallenge a final agency action; and (4) the challenged actions are committed by law to agency \ndiscretion.23 The Court addresses each argument in turn. \n \ncongressional authority. See ECF 6 ¶¶ 166-71. Because Plaintiffs do not move for preliminary \nequitable relief based on this claim, the Court does not discuss it further.  \n23 Defendants also argue that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \nclaims regarding the “firing of staff” at NEH and the “elimination or near elimination of entire \nPAGE 41 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 42 of 81\ni.  Tucker Act \nThe Tucker Act gives the Court of Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction over claims for \ndamages based on contracts with the United States where the amount in controversy exceeds \n$10,000. See 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1) (granting jurisdiction to Court of Federal Claims); 28 \nU.S.C. § 1346(a) (granting district courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Federal \nClaims when the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000). The Tucker Act, however, \n“does not permit the Court of Federal Claims to grant equitable or declaratory relief.” United \nAeronautical Corp. v. U.S. Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 2023) (cleaned up); see also \nRichardson v. Morris, 409 U.S. 464, 465 (1973) (explaining that “the Court of Claims has no \npower to grant equitable relief”). “Due to this limited remedial authority, a contract-based action \nfalls within the scope of the Tucker Act only if the plaintiff seeks money damages for the breach \nof a government contract.” United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1026 (emphasis in original). \nIndeed, the “Tucker Act yields . . . when the Administrative Procedure Act . . . provides an \navenue for relief.” Me. Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. 296, 323-24 (2020). \nThe Tucker Act “‘impliedly forbid[s]’ an APA action seeking injunctive and declaratory \nrelief only if that action is a ‘disguised’ breach-of-contract claim.” United Aeronautical \nCorp., 80 F.4th at 1026 (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). \nTo determine whether an action is a disguised breach of contract claim, the Ninth Circuit uses a \ntwo-part test derived from the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Megapulse. This test looks to: “(1) the \nsource of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims and (2) the type of relief sought (or \nappropriate).” Id. (quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, “[i]f rights and remedies are \n \ndivisions” at NEH. Plaintiffs, however, do not challenge employee terminations or agency \norganization decisions in their motion.  \nPAGE 42 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 43 of 81\nstatutorily or constitutionally based, then district courts have jurisdiction; if rights and remedies \nare contractually based then only the Court of Federal Claims does,” even if the plaintiff \nformally seeks injunctive relief. Cmty. Legal Servs., 137 F.4th at 938 (quoting United \nAeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1026) (emphases in United Aeronautical Corp.). “The Tucker \nAct does not bar an APA action if the plaintiff’s rights and remedies, as alleged, are \nnoncontractual—even if it is inevitable that the government will raise a contract provision as a \ndefense.” United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1026. In terms of the relief sought, “[t]he fact \nthat a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to \ncharacterize the relief as ‘money damages.’” Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988). \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ suit is in essence a claim seeking money damages for \nbreach of a government contract. Defendants rely heavily on the recent Supreme Court order \ngranting an application for an emergency stay in Department of Education v. California \n(“California”), in which the Supreme Court stated that the government was “likely to succeed in \nshowing the District Court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” \nbased on the Tucker Act. 604 U.S. ----, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025) (per curiam). The emergency \norder does not provide the reasoning behind this conclusion. The Supreme Court recently \nexplained that “[a]lthough [its] interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform \nhow a court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases.” Trump v. Boyle, 606 U.S. ----, \n2025 WL 2056889 (July 23, 2025) (emphasis added).  \nWithout further guidance as to the reasoning in California, the Court does not find that \nthe claims in this case are sufficiently like those in California for its guidance to be informative. \nIn California, eight states sued the Department of Education (“DOE”) and its officials, alleging \nthat DOE violated the APA by arbitrarily terminating grants awarded to high-need educational \nPAGE 43 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 44 of 81\nagencies and schools for the purpose of training teachers. Importantly, the plaintiffs in California \nrequested injunctive relief restoring grant funding, and “the terms and conditions of each \nindividual grant award [we]re at issue.” California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 132 F.4th 92, 96-97 \n(1st Cir. 2025). In contrast, Plaintiffs here seek a narrow injunction that would simply enjoin the \ngrant terminations and prevent unspent funds from being spent elsewhere, not require any \npayments. Further, Plaintiffs’ claims are not premised on the specific terms of any Councils’ \ngrant agreements, and the Court need not consider the grant terms to decide Plaintiffs’ APA \nclaims.   \nDefendants also argue that the grant agreements at issue are essentially contracts with the \nfederal government and that Plaintiffs seek “specific performance of the government’s funding \nof the grants—a contract remedy.” ECF 31 at 27 (citing Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, \nat *4).24 Defendants contend that the grant terminations at issue here are like those in California \nand cases involving similar statutes in which the courts have concluded that the claims were \nessentially breach of contract claims. See, e.g., Harris County v. Kennedy, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, \n2025 WL 1707665 (D.D.C. June 17, 2025); Vera Inst. of Just. v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 2025 \nWL 1865160 (D.D.C. July 7, 2025); Sols. in Hometown Connections v. Noem, 2025 \nWL 1103253 (D. Md. Apr. 14, 2025). These courts acknowledged, however, that the “Supreme \nCourt’s sparse reasoning in [California] has sown confusion” and that judges have not “been \nuniform in their application” of California. Vera Inst. of Just., 2025 WL 1865160, at *9 \n \n24 Defendants repeatedly cite the two-judge majority opinion of this D.C. Circuit panel \ndecision, which granted an emergency stay and held that the Tucker Act likely barred district \ncourt jurisdiction. This panel decision, however, was reconsidered en banc and the panel’s stay \nwas vacated, with the reasoning on the Tucker Act argument being “substantially for the reasons \nexplained by Judge Pillard” in her dissent in the panel decision. Widakuswara III, 2025 \nWL 1521355, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 28, 2025). \nPAGE 44 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 45 of 81\n(collecting cases); see also Harris County, 2025 WL 1707665, at *13-14 (noting that the \n“Supreme Court’s brief foray into the jurisdictional issue left many questions unanswered,” and \nthat “[p]erhaps because of these unanswered questions, different judges have applied \n[California] in different ways” and collecting cases). \nIndeed, many courts have declined to apply California to challenges to grant terminations \nand have found that the Tucker Act did not bar jurisdiction.25 The Court finds particularly \npersuasive the D.C. Circuit’s en banc decision in Widakuswara III, substantially adopting Judge \nPillard’s dissent in Widakuswara II, the earlier panel decision. In her dissent, Judge Pillard \ndiscussed California and distinguished between “entities created by statute and designated by \nCongress to receive specified sums” (for which the Tucker Act would not bar jurisdiction) and \nparties whose “only claim was to sums awarded to them in previously awarded discretionary \ngrants” (for which the Tucker Act would bar jurisdiction). Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, \nat *13 (Pillard, J., dissenting). “If a plaintiff’s claim depends on interpretations of statutes and \nregulations rather than the terms of an agreement negotiated by the parties, the claim is not in \nessence contractual.” Id. at *12 (Pillard, J., dissenting). The statutes at issue in Widakuswara—\nwhich the D.C. Circuit considered to be in the former category—established broadcasting \nnetworks and “required allocation of funds to those specific, named entities” to perform specific \nfunctions.

See Thakur v. Trump, --- F. \nSupp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1734471, at *19 (N.D. Cal.

Ct. 753 (2025), in which the \nSupreme Court declined to stay injunctive relief based on the Tucker Act. 2025 WL 1288817, \nat *14. In AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, as here, the plaintiffs’ “claims did not depend on \nwhether their contracts were breached, but on whether the agency’s policy directives were \nunlawful in the face of federal statutes appropriating funds for specific purposes.” Id. Here, the \nAct directs appropriate funds to be used for specified purposes, and Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendants’ policy directives were unlawful under the Act.  \nPAGE 46 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 47 of 81\nin part because the defendant’s purported authority for terminating the grants was 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4)). As in Widakuswara, Plaintiffs’ “claim of entitlement rests on [Defendants’] \nalleged contravention of applicable statutory and constitutional constraints—not the terms of any \nparticular contract. . . . The Congressional basis of their entitlement precedes the individual \ngrants that deliver their allocations.” Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, at *12 (Pillard, J., \ndissenting).  \nFurther, Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief. See ECF 6 (Am. Compl.) at 40. \nThis “prospective equitable declaratory and injunctive relief against allegedly unlawful conduct \n[is] outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims and properly within the jurisdiction of the \ndistrict court.” S.F. Unified Sch. Dist., 2025 WL 1180729, at *7; see also Martin Luther King, Jr. \nCounty v. Turner, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1582368, at *10 (W.D. Wash. June 3, 2025) \n(“Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief only, they do not seek money damages based \non a breach of contract claim. . . . This, alone, is sufficient to render the Tucker Act \ninapplicable.”). In addition, the Court of Federal Claims cannot provide this form of equitable \nrelief. “The result requested by [Defendants] would mean that no court has jurisdiction to hear \nplaintiffs’ claims. Not only is this result contrary to common sense, but it also conflicts with the \n‘strong presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action’ that is embodied in the \nAPA.” See Cmty. Legal Servs., 137 F.4th at 939 (quoting Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 \nU.S. 480, 486 (2015)).  \nPlaintiffs bring a “suit seeking to enforce the statutory mandate itself, which happens to \nbe one for the payment of money.” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 901. Even in California, the Supreme \nCourt reaffirmed the holding in Bowen that “a district court’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the \npossibility’ that an order setting aside an agency’s action may result in the disbursement of \nPAGE 47 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 48 of 81\nfunds.” California, 145 S. Ct. at 968 (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 910). Thus, the Tucker Act \ndoes not preclude the Court’s jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs’ APA claims. \nii.  Preclusion by the ICA \nOne of Plaintiffs’ arguments under the APA is that Defendants’ conduct was contrary to \nthe ICA, rendering that conduct contrary to law under the APA. Defendants argue that the Court \ncannot review this assertion under the APA because the ICA provides for exclusive enforcement \nby the Comptroller General. Defendants cite General Land Office v. Biden in support of this \nargument. 722 F. Supp. 3d 710 (S.D. Tex. 2024). In General Land Office, the Southern District \nof Texas concluded that because “the ICA provides that the Comptroller General may bring suit \nfor alleged ICA violations and meticulously outlines the mechanism for doing so . . . . APA \nreview for ICA violations is improper.” Id. at 734 (citation omitted). That court held that the \nplaintiffs’ ICA-based APA claim was, therefore, “precluded from judicial review.” Id. at 734-35.  \nAs discussed, the ICA does not provide a private right of action. Yet, that does not mean \nthat the ICA also precludes Plaintiffs’ APA claims based on the argument that the actions of the \nNEH Defendants are contrary to law. There is a meaningful distinction between direct challenges \nunder the ICA and an APA challenge asserting that an agency action is contrary to law because it \nviolates the ICA. In the absence of binding precedent to the contrary, the Court finds more \npersuasive the reasoning in other district courts that “[m]erely because Congress expressly \nprovided a role and process for the Comptroller General to address perceived violations of [the \nICA] on behalf of Congress does not operate more broadly . . . to foreclose private parties from \nseeking review of agency action for violating the same statute under the APA.” Am. Ctr. for Int’l \nLab. Solidarity v. Chavez-DeRemer, 2025 WL 1795090, at *22 (D.D.C. June 30, 2025); see also \nid. (“[T]he mere fact that the Impoundment Control Act affirmatively empowers the Comptroller \nGeneral to sue is not sufficient to overcome the ‘strong presumption’ in favor of review under \nPAGE 48 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 49 of 81\nthe APA.”); Aids Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 770 F. Supp. 3d 121, 148 n.17 \n(D.D.C. 2025) (stating that the defendants’ argument that a violation of ICA cannot be a basis for \nfinding action contrary to law under APA because the ICA allows for enforcement by the \nComptroller General “lacks merit”); New York v. Trump, 769 F. Supp. 3d 119, 138 n.13 \n(D.R.I. 2025) (“Defendants assert that because the ICA does not provide for a private right of \naction, the statute is ‘generally not enforceable through an APA suit.’ The Court declines to \nadopt such a narrow view of what it may consider when determining whether an agency has \nacted ‘not in accordance with law’ under the APA. In the Court’s view, ‘not in accordance with \nlaw,’ refers to ‘any law.’” (emphasis in original) (citation omitted)). Thus, Plaintiffs’ APA claim \nchallenging the NEH Defendants’ actions as contrary to the ICA is not precluded. \niii. Final Agency Action \nFor an agency action to be reviewable under the APA, it must be “final.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. \nAn agency action is final when the challenged action (1) “marks the consummation of the \nagency’s decisionmaking process,” and (2) is an action “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n177-78 (1997) (cleaned up). The NEH termination letters that Plaintiffs received on April 2, \n2025, stated that their federal grants were terminated, effective that same day. Further, the \nguidance for terminated grants that NEH circulated in April 2025 stated that there was no means \nof dispute resolution, meaning that the terminations were final and not appealable. At the time \nwhen Plaintiffs filed this suit, “[a]s a direct consequence of the termination letters, [Plaintiffs] \nimmediately stopped receiving grant funding.” Thakur, 2025 WL 1734471, at *16. Thus, at that \ntime, the April grant termination letters were final agency actions. See id.; S. Educ. Found. v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1453047, at *15 (D.D.C. May 21, 2025) \n(holding that letter stating that grant terminated immediately was final agency action); Am. \nPAGE 49 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 50 of 81\nCouncil, 2025 WL 2097738, at *13-14 (finding that mass termination of NEH grants to non-\nCouncil grantees—by means of identical letters as here—constituted final agency action).  \nOn June 2, 2025, NEH emailed Plaintiffs, purporting partially to rescind the April 2nd \ngrant terminations and restore funding up to 20 percent. Those notices stated that funding was \nstill reduced from 40 percent to 20 percent and acknowledged the “incredible hardship.” \nDefendants argue that these June emails “largely rescinded” the earlier grant terminations, and \nthus the April grant terminations no longer represent the consummation of the agency’s decision-\nmaking process and are no longer final agency action for purposes of an APA challenge.  \nUnder the voluntary cessation doctrine, NEH’s voluntary change in conduct after \nPlaintiffs filed this lawsuit does not moot Plaintiffs’ claims. See West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 720. \nFurther, even if the rescission or revocation of a final agency decision undid its finality, of which \nthe Court is skeptical, the new funding decision by the NEH Defendants still has significantly \nreduced Plaintiffs’ grant funding27 and contains the same alleged deficiencies as the original \ndecision. This reduction marks the consummation of NEH’s decision-making process and has \nlegal consequences for Plaintiffs. Thus, Plaintiffs challenge a final agency action.  \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs make a “programmatic challenge” to the dismantling \nof NEH and do not challenge the final action of grant terminations. In their motion, however, \nPlaintiffs do not challenge the “dismantling” of NEH, although that information is provided as \nbackground, for context, and to clarify who was involved in the grant termination decisions. \nPlaintiffs have moved for an injunction solely relating to the grant terminations. Plaintiffs \n \n27 Whether NEH considered funding for the Federal/State Partnership originally at 40 \npercent of $192 million ($76.8 million) or the $65 million from the table attached to the joint \nexplanatory statement of the 2024 Appropriations Act, the reduction to 20 percent of $192 \nmillion ($38.4 million) is a significant reduction. \nPAGE 50 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 51 of 81\nchallenge the “discrete and clear” conduct of NEH’s cuts to grant awards, effectively shutting \ndown the Councils. As Judge Pillard explained in her dissent that was later adopted by the en \nbanc majority: “The fact that the government elected to take many unlawful agency actions . . . \ndoes not exempt their violations from judicial scrutiny.” Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, \nat *9 (Pillard, J., dissenting). “[T]he very volume of lawbreaking and the scope of operational \nfunctioning laid waste does not add up to courts losing the power to determine the lawfulness of \nagency action.” Id.  \niv. Committed to Agency Discretion \nUnder § 701(a)(2) of the APA, administrative action that is “committed to agency \ndiscretion by law” is exempt from judicial review. The Supreme Court has read the “committed \nto agency discretion” exception “quite narrowly, restricting it to those rare circumstances where \nthe relevant statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to \njudge the agency’s exercise of discretion.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 772 (2019) \n(quotation marks omitted). Thus, this exception applies only when discretion is so unlimited that \n“there is truly no law to apply.” Cmty. Legal Servs., 137 F.4th at 942 (quotation marks omitted).  \nDefendants argue that the Act is one of these rare statutes. Defendants cite that the Act \nauthorizes the Chairperson to “enter into arrangements, including contracts, grants, loans, and \nother forms of assistance” to achieve enumerated objectives, but does not require NEH to fund \nspecific grants. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 956(c), 956(f)(6), 960(b)(1). As discussed above, however, the \nAct provides a sufficient mandate to NEH to fund the Federal/State Partnership, including \nproviding a statutory formula for approved plans and requiring that funds shall be available to all \napproved plans as of the first of the fiscal year. Thus, the NEH Defendants’ grant termination \ndecisions are reviewable. Similarly, 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 “does not reflect standardless \ndiscretion,” but instead “permits an agency to terminate a grant in certain circumstances.” \nPAGE 51 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 52 of 81\nThakur, 2025 WL 1734471, at *17. Thus, the NEH Defendants’ decisions are not committed to \nagency discretion. \nb.  Contrary to Law \nCourts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) & (C). Plaintiffs argue in their motion that they are likely to succeed on their claim \nthat Defendants acted contrary to law in four ways: (1) by failing to follow the statutory process \nfor grant terminations or modifications, see 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7); (2) by cutting funding that \nwas required to be provided to the Councils under 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4); (3) by failing to provide \nappellate rights, see 2 C.F.R. § 200.342; and (4) by violating the ICA. The Court addresses each \nin turn. \ni.  Statutory Process for Grant Suspensions or Terminations \nPlaintiffs argue that under the Act, grants may not be suspended until the Chairperson has \nmade a finding “after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing,” and that the Chairperson \nmade no such finding, much less with notice, opportunity for hearing, or opportunity to cure. \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7). Defendants do not dispute that they have not followed this procedure. \nInstead, Defendants respond that this provision applies only in the narrow circumstances \ndescribed in § 956(f)(7). This provision states: \nWhenever the Chairperson, after reasonable notice and opportunity \nfor hearing, finds that-- \n(A) a group or grant recipient is not complying \nsubstantially with the provisions of this subsection; \n(B) a State agency or grant recipient is not complying \nsubstantially with terms and conditions of its State plan or \ngrant recipient application approved under this subsection; \nor \nPAGE 52 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 53 of 81\n(C) any funds granted to any group or State agency or grant \nrecipient under this subsection have been diverted from the \npurposes for which they are allotted or paid,  \nthe Chairperson shall immediately notify the Secretary of the \nTreasury and the group, State agency, or grant recipient with \nrespect to which such finding was made that no further grants will \nbe made under this subsection to such group, State agency, or grant \nrecipient until there is no longer a default or failure to comply or \nthe diversion has been corrected, or, if the compliance or \ncorrection is impossible, until such group, State agency, or grant \nrecipient repays or arranges the repayment of the Federal funds \nwhich have been improperly diverted or expended. \n20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7) (emphasis added). This subsection is ambiguous; specifically, it is unclear \nwhether the phrase “further grants” refers to future plan approvals, funding of existing open \ngrants, or both. \nThe Court first looks to the Act as a whole. Importantly, the text of § 956(f)(7), \napplicable to NEH, comes from § 954(h) of the NEA provision. Subsection 954(h) applies to all \ngrants under the NEA statutes, including direct federal grants, while § 956(f)(7) applies only to \ngrants under the Federal/State Partnership. For direct grants, it is logical to refer to “further \ngrants” because the direct recipient applies for a discrete grant for each project. The \nFederal/State Partnership, however, primarily involves a general operating support grant, from \nwhich the State repeatedly draws funds throughout the fiscal year. The State does not receive its \nstandard operating grant as a lump-sum payment, but submits reimbursements requests to NEH. \nUnder this system, it would not make sense for NEH to continue reimbursing a State that is not \ncomplying with its obligations. The term “grant” is used broadly throughout § 956. Funds are \ndescribed as “granted” in § 956(f)(7)(C). Looking at the statute as a whole, “further grants” more \nreasonably refers to both future grants and funds that have not yet been paid to the State on an \nopen grant, even though the “grant” already has been approved. \nPAGE 53 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 54 of 81\nThe Court next looks to the legislative history for clarification. When Congress amended \nthe Act in 1976 to add what is now § 956(f)(7), it provided no reason for the amendment. \nSubsection 956(f)(7), however, took its text from a clause in the statute establishing NEA. See 20 \nU.S.C. § 954(h). In introducing an earlier version of what is now § 954(h) in 1963, Congress \nexplained that the “subsection provides for suspension or recapture of grants.” S. Rep. \nNo. 88-780, at 29 (1963) (emphases added). When enacting the law in 1965, the congressional \nreports stated that what is now subsection (h) “sets forth the circumstances under which grants to \na group or to a State agency may be terminated, providing there has been reasonable notice and \nopportunity for a hearing.” See S. Rep. No. 89-300, at 22 (1965) (emphasis added); H.R. Rep. \nNo. 89-618, at 9 (1965) (same). These explanations show that the purpose of § 956(f)(7) is to \nprovide a mechanism to terminate or suspend grants when a grant recipient is not in compliance \nwith the Act, and to prevent that grant recipient from receiving any further funds (and potentially \nto have to repay funds), until the recipient has cured the noncompliance. \nFinally, the Supreme Court “has long considered that the title of a statute and the heading \nof a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of the statute.” \nDubin v. United States, 599 U.S. 110, 120-21 (2023) (quotation marks omitted); see also Scalia \n& Garner, at 221-24 (discussing the “Title-and-Headings Canon”). The heading of § 956(f) is: \n“Grants-in-aid programs; designation of State administrative agency; matching funds; \napplications and plans; allotments; cost limitations; grants to regional groups; non-Federal \nfunding; definitions; suspensions of grants; single entity limitation.” (emphasis added). \nSimilarly, the heading of § 954(h) is: “Suspension of grants for defaults, noncompliance with \nprovisions and plans, and diversion of funds; repayment of funds.” These headings support that \n§ 956(f) does not only prevent the payment of any possible future grants, but also governs the \nPAGE 54 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 55 of 81\nsuspension of currently awarded (open) grants that have not been fully paid. The Court thus \nconcludes that § 956(f)(7) applies when NEH rescinds funding allotted to the Federal/State \nPartnership. \nUnder this reading of § 956(f)(7), Defendants’ argument that a grant can be suspended \nfor other reasons ignores the principle of statutory construction that reflects the “ancient maxim” \nof expressio unius est exclusio alterius: the express mention of one thing excludes all others. See \nNat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of R.R. Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458 (1974) \n(“[W]hen legislation expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, courts should not \nexpand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies.”); see also NLRB v. SW Gen., \nInc., 580 U.S. 288, 302 (2017) (explaining that this canon means “expressing one item of an \nassociated group or series excludes another left unmentioned” (cleaned up)); Scalia & Garner, \nat 107-10 (discussing the “Negative-Implication Canon”). This canon applies only “when \ncircumstances support[] a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be \nexcluded.” SW Gen., Inc., 580 U.S. at 302 (quoting Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 \nU.S. 73, 81 (2002)). In this case, the Act contains one provision, § 956(f)(7), that provides a \nmechanism for terminating and suspending grants. This provision sets forth three circumstances \nunder which the Chairperson can stop providing funding to a grant recipient and does not include \nany language to suggest that other circumstances may also trigger the termination of funding.28 \nIt is undisputed that the NEH Defendants did not terminate Plaintiffs’ grants for a reason \nlisted in § 956(f)(7). Instead, the April termination letters referenced 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) in \n \n28 Defendants also argue that under the terms of the grant agreements with the Councils, \nNEH is authorized to suspend or terminate grants based on changed agency priorities. See \nECF 32-1 at 41 (“NEH may suspend or terminate awards in whole or in part if: . . . an award no \nlonger effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities . . . .”). This contractual term, however, does \nnot supersede the statutory requirements set forth by Congress in § 956(f)(7). \nPAGE 55 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 56 of 81\nstating that the grant being terminated “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities \nand conditions of the Grant Agreement.” ECF 11-1 at 2. This regulation is in the OMB Guidance \nfor Federal Financial Assistance, in a subsection titled “Remedies for Noncompliance.” The \nNEH governing statute, however, already establishes the remedies for noncompliance in \n§ 956(f)(7), and it is a sensible inference that all other remedies for noncompliance were meant \nto be excluded.  \nAdditionally, the NEH governing statutes specifically establish the Federal/State \nPartnership as a priority and require its stable funding to furnish “adequate” programs and other \nstatutory requirements. The vague and general statement in the OMB regulation does not \noverride these statutory requirements. Further, the OMB regulation only allows agencies to \nterminate grant agreements “to the extent authorized by law.” See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). \nThus, “this regulation cannot authorize actions that contravene statutory requirements, nor does it \nrelieve [the NEH Defendants] of [their] duty to follow the law.” See Am. Pub. Health Ass’n v. \nNat’l Insts. of Health, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1822487, at *20 (D. Mass. July 2, 2025) \n(quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the NEH Defendants’ purported grant terminations \nunder § 200.340(a)(4) are only valid to the extent that statutes authorize the terminations. As \ndiscussed, the Act does not authorize termination of grants without a finding that the grant \nrecipient is not complying substantially with the requirements of the statute or the grant \nagreement or has diverted funds from the purposes for which they are allotted. Thus, Plaintiffs \nare likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the NEH Defendants acted contrary to law \nin terminating Plaintiffs’ grants without such a finding. \nii.  Statutory Formula for Funding \nPlaintiffs next argue that Congress established a framework for how NEH must operate \nthe Federal/State Partnership in 20 U.S.C. § 956, and Defendants are failing to comply with that \nPAGE 56 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 57 of 81\nstatutory directive. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the statute provides a formula for how NEH \nfunds must be allotted to approved plans. Id. § 956(f)(4). This formula requires 44 percent to be \ndistributed equally among all approved states and jurisdictions, 22 percent to be distributed based \non population, and 34 percent to be distributed at the discretion of the Chairperson, either by \nstate or regionally. Id. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants acted contrary to law in failing to follow \nthis formula. \nDefendants respond by incorporating their argument raised in response to Plaintiffs’ \nSeparation of Powers claim—that NEH has discretion and does not have to follow the formula \nset forth in § 956(f)(4) because of the residual clause contained in § 956(f)(6) and overall general \ndiscretion. For the reasons described above in rejecting this argument for Plaintiffs’ Separation \nof Powers claim, the Court rejects this contention by Defendants. As discussed above, \n§ 956(f)(6) does not provide the Chairperson with discretion to ignore the formula set forth in \n§ 956(f)(4) for how to allocate funds appropriated to the Federal/State Partnership. Nor does the \nfact that funds remain available after the fiscal year mean that Defendants can ignore their \nstatutory directives. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the NEH Defendants must \nallocate funds appropriated for approved plans under the formula set forth in § 956(f)(4). \niii. Appeals Process \nThird, Plaintiffs argue that NEH failed to provide a mechanism for appeal of the grant \nterminations. Plaintiffs cite 2 C.F.R. § 200.342, which requires that a federal agency “must \nmaintain written procedures for processing objections, hearings, and appeals.” Plaintiffs contend \nthat these written procedures are the terms and conditions of the grants, which give the Councils \nthe right to appeal a termination. See McDonald Decl., Ex. A. at 42. Defendants respond that \nthere is no statutory or regulatory right to an administrative appeal because the regulations \nPAGE 57 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 58 of 81\nprovide for an appeal only in circumstances where NEH initiates “a remedy for noncompliance.” \nSee 2 C.F.R. § 200.342. It is undisputed that NEH did not find noncompliance by Plaintiffs.  \nThis claim raises concerns with the Tucker Act. Although Plaintiffs style this argument as \nrelying on a regulation, at this stage it appears that Plaintiffs are relying on the terms of the grant \nagreements. Therefore, the Court declines to consider this argument as a basis for the equitable \nrelief that Plaintiffs seek. \niv. ICA \nPlaintiffs also allege that the NEH Defendants’ conduct is contrary to the statutory \nmandates of the ICA. The ICA codifies Separation of Powers principles and limits the extent to \nwhich the President may defer spending funds that Congress appropriated for particular \npurposes. See County of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 531 (N.D. Cal. 2017) \n(“Congress has intentionally limited the ability of the President to withhold or ‘impound’ \nappropriated funds and has provided that the President may only do so after following particular \nprocedures and after receiving Congress’s express permission.” (citing the ICA)); see also Aiken \nCounty, 725 F.3d at 261 n.1 (explaining that “even the President does not have unilateral \nauthority to refuse to spend the funds” appropriated to an agency and explaining the rescission \nrequest process in the ICA) ; S. Rep. No. 93-688, at 75 (1974) (explaining that the objective of \nthe ICA was to assure that “the practice of reserving funds does not become a vehicle for \nfurthering Administration policies and priorities at the expense of those decided by Congress”).  \nThe ICA vests the Executive Branch with strictly circumscribed authority to impound \nappropriated funds. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 683-84. If the Executive Branch seeks the permanent \ncancellation of funds, it may propose a “recission.” To propose a rescission, the Executive \nBranch must comply with the following specific procedures.  \nPAGE 58 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 59 of 81\nWhenever the President, the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget, the head of any department or agency of the United \nStates, or any officer or employee of the United States proposes to \ndefer any budget authority provided for a specific purpose or \nproject, the President shall transmit to the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate a special message specifying-- \n(1) the amount of the budget authority proposed to be deferred; \n(2) any account, department, or establishment of the Government \nto which such budget authority is available for obligation, and the \nspecific projects or governmental functions involved; \n(3) the period of time during which the budget authority is \nproposed to be deferred; \n(4) the reasons for the proposed deferral, including any legal \nauthority invoked to justify the proposed deferral; \n(5) to the maximum extent practicable, the estimated fiscal, \neconomic, and budgetary effect of the proposed deferral; and \n(6) all facts, circumstances, and considerations relating to or \nbearing upon the proposed deferral and the decision to effect the \nproposed deferral, including an analysis of such facts, \ncircumstances, and considerations in terms of their application to \nany legal authority, including specific elements of legal authority, \ninvoked to justify such proposed deferral, and to the maximum \nextent practicable, the estimated effect of the proposed deferral \nupon the objects, purposes, and programs for which the budget \nauthority is provided. \nId. § 684(a). If, on the other hand, the Executive Branch seeks temporarily to withhold funds, it \nmay propose a “deferral.” The process for proposing a deferral is the same as for proposing a \nrescission in all material respects. See id. § 683(a). \nFor purposes of this analysis, it does not matter whether NEH technically intended to \npropose a permanent rescission or a temporary deferral. That is because Plaintiffs argue, and \nDefendants do not dispute, that the Executive Branch and the NEH Defendants did not follow the \nspecific procedural steps outlined in §§ 683 and 684. There is no evidence that a special message \nPAGE 59 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 60 of 81\ndetailing the indefinite and widespan withdrawals of obligated funding was ever communicated \nto Congress.  \nMoreover, to the extent that NEH intended to propose a temporary deferral, the ICA \nstates that deferrals are permissible for only one of three reasons: “(1) to provide for \ncontingencies; (2) to achieve savings made possible by or through changes in requirements or \ngreater efficiency of operations; or (3) as specifically provided by law.” Id. § 684(b). Indeed, \n“[n]o officer or employee of the United States may defer any budget authority for any other \npurpose.” Id. Plaintiffs argue that setting aside the ICA’s procedural requirements, Defendants \nfailed to justify the grant terminations under any of these three bases.29 Defendants concede this \nviolation as well. Cf. New York v. Trump, 769 F. Supp. 3d at 138 (concluding that the plaintiffs \n“substantiated a likelihood of success in proving that the Executive’s actions were contrary to \nlaw when bringing about a deferral of budget authority without sending a special message to \nCongress as the ICA requires”).  \nIn fact, Defendants’ only argument with respect to the merits of the ICA analysis is that \nNEH appropriations need not be spent in a particular year, and thus, NEH did not exceed its \ndiscretion under 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(6). But for the reasons provided in the Court’s discussion of \nthe Separation of Powers doctrine, Defendants have likely exceeded their discretion under \n§§ 956(f)(6) and 960(b)(1). Thus, Defendants’ conduct also likely needed to comport with the \n \n29 To the extent that Defendants may have relied on policy to support impoundments, that \nwould have been an insufficient justification. See, e.g., Inst. of Museum & Libr. Servs., \nB-337375, 2025 WL 1714233, at *7 n.33 (Comp. Gen. June 16, 2025) (“The ICA does not allow \ndeferrals for policy-based reasons, so to the extent a special message had proposed the deferral \n[of] . . . funds solely for compliance with the policies in EO 14238, that would likely have been \nimpermissible.”); Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, B-331564, 2020 WL 241373, at *5 (Comp. Gen. \nJan. 16, 2020) (“The ICA does not permit deferrals for policy reasons. [The agency’s] \njustification for the withholding falls squarely within the scope of an impermissible policy \ndeferral.” (citations omitted)).   \nPAGE 60 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 61 of 81\nprocedural requirements for deferral or rescission under the ICA. Given the absence of \npersuasive argument or evidence from Defendants to the contrary, the Court finds that Plaintiffs \nare likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the NEH Defendants acted contrary to law \n(specifically, the ICA) by terminating Plaintiffs’ grants without comporting with those \nprocedural requirements.  \nc.  Arbitrary and Capricious  \nAgency action is  \narbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which \nCongress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its \ndecision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is \nso implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view \nor the product of agency expertise. \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983). \n“[T]he touchstone of ‘arbitrary and capricious’ review under the APA is ‘reasoned \ndecisionmaking.’” Altera Corp. & Subsidiaries v. Comm’r, 926 F.3d 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 52). “[A]n agency’s action can only survive arbitrary \nor capricious review where it has articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” All. for the Wild Rockies v. \nPetrick, 68 F.4th 475, 493 (9th Cir. 2023) (cleaned up). Post-hoc rationalizations cannot justify \nan agency’s actions. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 419 (1971). \nA court “must not ‘rubber-stamp’ . . . administrative decisions that [it] deem[s] inconsistent with \na statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute.” Ocean \nAdvocs. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 402 F.3d 846, 859 (9th Cir. 2005) (first alteration in \noriginal, remaining alterations added). \nPAGE 61 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 62 of 81\nAn agency also acts in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it changes policy without \nappropriate reasoning. As the Supreme Court has explained, “[a]n agency may not . . . depart \nfrom a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the books. And of \ncourse the agency must show that there are good reasons for the new policy,” even though it \nneed not convince the court of the merits of its new policy. FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (citation omitted). Under the “change-in-position doctrine . . . . \nagencies are free to change their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation \nfor the change, display awareness that they are changing position, and consider serious reliance \ninterests.” FDA v. Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C., 604 U.S. ----, 145 S. Ct. 898, 917 (2025) \n(cleaned up). \nDefendants again cite the OMB regulation to argue that a grant may be terminated \nwithout advance notice if NEH finds that the grant no longer effectuates program goals or \nagency priorities. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). But “[p]ost hoc explanations of agency action \nby . . . counsel cannot substitute for the agency’s own articulation of the basis for its decision.” \nArrington v. Daniels, 516 F.3d 1106, 1113 (9th Cir. 2008). The mass termination letters stated \nthat the terminated grant “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions \nof the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination due to several reasonable causes, as \noutlined in 2 C.F.R. § 200.340.” The termination notices also referenced the President’s \nExecutive Order No. 14217 dated February 19, 2025 (which was apparently a mistake), and the \nPresident’s agenda. The June emails partially rescinding the grant terminations merely stated that \nthe Councils would be funded at 20 percent of the NEH’s appropriation amount, “which is the \nminimum that NEH is congressionally mandated to award.” Davis Decl. Ex C at 1. None of these \nletters set out any factual findings or reasoned bases for the NEH Defendants’ termination \nPAGE 62 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 63 of 81\ndecisions, much less provided the Councils with any explanation. The emails contain only \nconclusory statements and provide no indication of reasoned decision-making. Thakur, 2025 \nWL 1734471, at *14. As explained by the Court in Thakur, “2 C.F.R. § 200.340, to the extent it \napplies, does not alter the requirement under the APA that Defendants must provide a reasoned \ndecision for their termination.” Id. at *14 n.25. \nAdding to the arbitrary and capricious nature of the actions taken by the NEH Defendants \nis that the grant reductions “were likely performed en masse, without individualized analysis.” \nId. at *14. Although McDonald summarily states in his declaration that he “undertook \nindividualized assessments” of the grants, at this stage the record does not support that. See \nsupra note 11. Moreover, the reduction “of previously awarded grants is a per se change in \nagency policy, requiring a reasoned explanation of the change.” Thakur, 2025 WL 1734471, \nat *15. As discussed, no such reasoned explanation was provided.  \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs are not “regulated entities” as in Wages & White \nLion, and thus the change-in-position framework—and specifically, the consideration of reliance \ninterests—does not apply. But the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have applied this \nframework and considered reliance interests even where the plaintiff is not a regulated entity. \nIn 2020, for example, the Supreme Court stated: “When an agency changes course . . . it must \n‘be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must \nbe taken into account.’” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 \n(2020) (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221-22 (2016) (quotation \nmarks omitted)) (considering reliance interests of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \nrecipients); see also Nat’l Urb. League v. Ross, 977 F.3d 770, 778 (9th Cir. 2020) (considering \nthe reliance interests of the public in a replan of the census); City & Cnty. of S.F. v. U.S. \nPAGE 63 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 64 of 81\nCitizenship & Immigr. Servs., 981 F.3d 742, 761 (9th Cir. 2020) (considering reliance interests of \nimmigrants). Thus, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the NEH \nDefendants acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in terminating the grants.  \nB.  Irreparable Harm \nTo meet their burden for preliminary equitable relief, Plaintiffs must “demonstrate that \nirreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis \nomitted); see also Immigr. Defs. Law Ctr., 2025 WL 2080742, at *15 (stating that preliminary \ninjunction factors apply to an APA stay). Such harm “is traditionally defined as harm for which \nthere is no adequate legal remedy, such as an award of damages.” Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. \nBrewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014). \nA plaintiff’s showing of serious “ongoing harms to their organizational missions” \nestablishes a likelihood of irreparable harm. Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 \n(9th Cir. 2013); see also League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. \nCir. 2016) (an increased difficulty for a plaintiff to accomplish its “primary mission” is adequate \nto show irreparable harm). And where projects rely heavily or entirely on federal funding, “[a] \ntotal loss of federal funding would be catastrophic, and the [Plaintiffs’] need for certainty renders \ndamages inadequate.” City & Cnty. of S.F., 897 F.3d at 1244. “In cases involving government \nexpenditures, ‘once the relevant funds have been obligated, a court cannot reach them in order to \naward relief.’ Any transfer, re-allocation, or re-obligation of these funds would be an irreparable \nloss.” Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., 775 F. Supp. 3d 335, 349 (D.D.C. 2025)30 (quoting \nCity of Houston v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). \n \n30 In the cited opinion in Climate United Fund, the district court was granting in part the \nplaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order. Later, the district court issued a preliminary \ninjunction, which was stayed in part on other grounds pending appeal. See Climate United Fund \nPAGE 64 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 65 of 81\nAs U.S. Chief District Judge John McConnell, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Rhode Island explained, \nIt is so obvious that it almost need not be stated that when money \nis obligated and therefore expected (particularly money that has \nbeen spent and reimbursement is sought) and is not paid as \npromised, harm follows—debt is incurred, debt is unpaid . . . \nservices stop, and budgets are upended. And when there is no end \nin sight to the Defendants’ funding freeze, that harm is amplified \nbecause those served by the expected but frozen funds have no \nidea when the promised monies will flow again. \nNew York v. Trump, 769 F. Supp. 3d at 142. Like the states in New York, Plaintiffs have “laid out \nscores of examples of obligated funding and the harm that withholding such funding has \ncaused.” Id. \nThe chaos caused by Defendants’ conduct harms Plaintiffs’ reputations.31 Injury to \nreputation “is not easily measured or fully compensable in damage” and thus is “often held to be \nirreparable.” See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 1996) \n(collecting cases); see also Thakur, 2025 WL 1734471, at *24 (finding that evidence of “layoffs \n \nv. Citibank, N.A., 2025 WL 1118430 (D.D.C. Apr. 15, 2025), stayed in part by 2025 \nWL 1123856 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 16, 2025).  \n31 See Asmo Decl. ¶ 12 (“The abrupt loss of NEH funding has forced OHC to break \ncommitments to organizations it has long-standing relationships with, causing irreparable harm \nto their operations and to OHC’s reputation as a trustworthy partner.”); Best Decl. ¶¶ 8-9 \n(explaining that “[c]ommunity and partner organizations may begin to view HAR as a unreliable \nor unstable collaborator,” “[r]ebuilding trust could be difficult,” and “longstanding institutional \npartnerships . . . may be jeopardized”); Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10 (stating that “[a]fter promising \nassistance, however, NMHC is now in a position of withdrawing support from local community \norganizations, which . . . leads to significant distrust,” and that the “termination of subawards \nwill likely have a chilling effect on applicants who under normal circumstances would consider \nNMHC a stable funder”); Oey Decl. ¶ 8 (explaining that SDHC’s decision to cancel the \nSmithsonian exhibit may “impact [its] reputation and relationships with national partners”); \nPerez-Verdia Decl. ¶ 11 (“[T]he NEH termination has damaged AKHF’s relationships with \npartner organizations and communities. . . . These disruptions are not just logistical—they \nrepresent a breakdown of trust.”); Rockoff Decl. ¶ 6 (explaining that the “renewed relationship” \nwith a historically Black college or university “is now at risk”). \nPAGE 65 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 66 of 81\nof team members, interruption of graduate programs, and the potential complete loss of projects” \nwould harm the plaintiffs’ reputations, causing irreparable injury); Maryland, 2025 \nWL 1585051, at *34 (“The abrupt exiting of members and erosion of trust built between service \nprograms and the community will have a detrimental impact on these programs absent \nimmediate injunctive relief.”).  \nThe record also contains unrebutted evidence of the irreparable harm Plaintiffs are \nalready experiencing, including cancelling programs and loss of staff. See Elev8 Balt., 2025 \nWL 1865971, at *25 (finding that loss of staff, such that plaintiffs cannot carry out their mission, \nconstitutes irreparable harm); Maryland, 2025 WL 1585051, at *34 (finding that “ceas[ing] or \nsignificantly curtail[ing] operations” constitutes irreparable harm). When these programs are \ncancelled, “there can be no do over and no redress.” Newby, 838 F.3d at 9. No amount of money \ndamages will allow Plaintiffs to recover these lost opportunities. \nAmong other harms, Oregon Humanities has cancelled programs in rural communities \nand a free summer course for youth, and stopped all grant-making activities after receiving \nNEH’s grant termination notice. Davis Decl. ¶¶ 16-17. In Ohio, the OHC has lost funding for \norganizations in rural Appalachia, including ones that serve women who are incarcerated and \nwomen who have escaped human trafficking. Asmo Decl. ¶ 8. The HAR and the SDHC \ncancelled contracts they had in place with the Smithsonian Museum to host a traveling \nexhibition—a one-time opportunity that will not reoccur. Best Decl. ¶ 6; Oey Decl. ¶ 8. The \nHAR also cancelled teacher institutes and workshops in Arkansas. Best Decl. ¶ 7. The NMHC \nwithdrew promised support to local community organizations recovering from devastating 2022 \nwildfires and their destruction of historical sites. Johnson Decl. ¶ 8. And in Alaska, the AKHF \nhas cut programs aimed at youth mental health and suicide prevention and programs supporting \nPAGE 66 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 67 of 81\nveterans. Perez-Verdia Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9. The AKHF also lost funding for its language preservation \nprogram, aimed at preserving 20 distinct Alaska Native languages, many of which are \nendangered. Id. ¶ 8. The Eyak language lost its last fluent speaker in 2008, and some languages \nhave fewer than 40 remaining fluent speakers. Id. Without these programs, these languages may \nbe lost forever. As described in the declarations, all these Councils have had to cut staff and \ncurtail their services and ability to serve their missions. Thus, Plaintiffs have shown irreparable \ninjury absent a preliminary injunction. \nC.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest \nThe Court turns to the final two Winter factors, the balance of the equities and the public \ninterest. These two factors “merge” into one when “the Government is the party opposing the \ninjunction.” Galvez v. Jaddou, 52 F.4th 821, 831 (9th Cir. 2022) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 435 (2009) (applying merged factors in stay context)). These factors merge because \n“the government’s interest is the public interest.” Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 \nF.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (emphasis in original) (applying merged factors in preliminary \ninjunction context). \nDefendants provide two principal arguments in support of their position that the equities \ndo not tip in Plaintiffs’ favor. First, Defendants argue that the public has an interest in the \nJudicial Branch respecting the judicial boundaries drawn by Congress. Defendants assert, citing \nthe vacated opinion granting a stay in Widakuswara II, that Congress has limited the resolution \nof these types of cases to specialized tribunals, such as the Court of Federal Claims. But for the \nreasons discussed above, this argument in unavailing because Defendants’ minor premise is \nfalse. This Court has jurisdiction over this lawsuit.  \nDefendants also argue that the relief sought by Plaintiffs would “disrupt NEH efforts to \nimplement the President’s directives while complying with the agency’s statutory obligations.” \nPAGE 67 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 68 of 81\nBut for the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success in their \nargument that the NEH Defendants are not complying with their statutory obligations. “There is \ngenerally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.” See Newby, 838 F.3d \nat 12. “To the contrary, there is a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies \nabide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.’” Id. (quoting Washington v. \nReno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)); see also Am. Council, 2025 WL 2097738, at *36 \n(same).32 Moreover, as the Court noted in its discussion of Plaintiffs’ irreparable harms, in \naddition to a substantial public interest in ensuring that the government obeys the law, there is a \nstrong public interest in the pursuit and preservation of locally-sourced humanities projects, as \nemphasized by Congress. Cf. Am. Council, 2025 WL 2097738, at *36 (emphasizing that the \nbalance of equities and public interest tilt in favor of a preliminary injunction “to preserve the \npossibility that we may yet get the opportunity to see what these scholars have to teach us”). \nConsidering all relevant interests, the balance of the equities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor.  \nD.  Scope of Relief \nPlaintiffs request that the Court enter both a stay under § 705 of the APA and a \npreliminary injunction against all Defendants. At oral argument, Plaintiffs abandoned their \nrequest for relief that could be construed as a mandatory injunction and clarified that they seek \nonly a prohibitory injunction and parallel stay under the APA. They request that the Court enjoin \nand stay the April 2nd and June 2nd actions and any reallocation or disbursement of the awarded \nfunds to any other party.  \n \n32 Defendants also raise concerns with ordering the release of funds into existing grants \nbecause those funds may not be retrievable afterward. But because, as discussed below, Plaintiffs \nrequest only a prohibitory injunction preventing allocated funds from being disbursed to other \nsources and preventing Defendants from implementing the unlawful grant terminations, this \nargument is now moot.  \nPAGE 68 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 69 of 81\nDefendants respond that any injunctive relief the Court grants must be narrowly tailored. \nThey argue that Plaintiffs inappropriately seek sweeping nationwide relief. Defendants also \nargue that the Federation lacks standing, that venue in the District of Oregon is inappropriate, \nand that the relief Plaintiffs seek is inconsistent with Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U.S. ----, 145 S. \nCt. 2540 (2025). The Court addresses in turn each of these three arguments advanced by \nDefendants.  \n1.  Standing for Plaintiff Federation  \nDefendants’ first argument is that Plaintiff Federation “is not in privity” with the \ngovernment because it is neither a party to grant agreements nor an intended third-party \nbeneficiary. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs instead seek relief that would benefit a host of \nCouncils that are not parties here. Thus, Defendants argue, allowing Plaintiffs’ requested \ninjunctive relief would violate the principles recently articulated in CASA, that universal \ninjunctions “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted federal courts,” and \ninjunctive relief is likely appropriate only when it is “complete,” not “universal.”  145 S. Ct. \nat 2548, 2556-57.  \nThe Court finds Defendants’ argument unpersuasive. First, the Federation properly is a \nplaintiff in this case. To have standing, a plaintiff must have a “personal interest . . . at the \ncommencement of the litigation.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), \nInc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000); see also Food & Drug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. 367, 379 (2024) (“For a plaintiff to get in the federal courthouse door and obtain a judicial \ndetermination of what the governing law is, the plaintiff cannot be a mere bystander, but instead \nmust have a ‘personal stake’ in the dispute.”). The required personal interest must satisfy three \nelements throughout the litigation: (1) an injury in fact, i.e., an invasion of a legally protected \ninterest that is concrete and particularized, as well as actual or imminent; (2) a causal connection \nPAGE 69 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 70 of 81\nbetween the injury-in-fact and the defendant’s challenged behavior; and (3) likelihood that the \ninjury-in-fact will be redressed by a favorable ruling. Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 180-81; \nsee also Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (reiterating that the “irreducible \nconstitutional minimum” of standing consists of “an injury in fact . . . fairly traceable to the \nchallenged conduct of the defendant, and . . . likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial \ndecision”). \nHere, Defendants challenge only the first element, that the Federation has not itself \nsuffered an injury that is at stake. The Court disagrees. The Federation alleges that it has suffered \ninjuries-in-fact from, among other conduct, the termination of tens of thousands of dollars in \ngrant money that NEH designated directly to the Federation itself. See Stein Decl. ¶ 15. This \npreviously approved funding would have supported the Federation’s ability to address the \nCouncils’ data evaluation needs, including funding in-person consultation with data and \nevaluation experts. Id.; cf. Thakur, 2025 WL 1734471, at *18, 21-22 (concluding that the \nplaintiffs sufficiently showed they had a “personal stake” in their claims because rescinded grant \nmoney was significant to their livelihoods and reputation). For the reasons provided in the \nCourt’s discussion of the Tucker Act, these allegations are not—as Defendants imply—in service \nof breach of contract claims. The Federation properly is a plaintiff in this lawsuit in its own right. \nThe Court may grant it equitable relief.  \nSecond, in addition to having a personal stake here, the Federation asserts standing with \nrespect to claims arising from the termination of NEH grants awarded to its members. When an \nassociation brings a lawsuit on behalf of its members, that is called “associational” or \n“organizational” standing. The Court agrees that the Federation has associational standing to \nbring claims on behalf of its member Councils. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975) \nPAGE 70 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 71 of 81\n(“Even in the absence of injury to itself, an association may have standing solely as the \nrepresentative of its members.”). An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its \nmembers when: “(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the \ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim \nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 199 \n(2023) (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  \nThe Federation satisfies each of the three elements required for associational standing. \nDefendants challenge only the third element of this test.33 They assert that “Plaintiffs provide no \nexplanation” for why this lawsuit does not require the individual participation of the members of \nthe Federation. The third element of the associational standing test “is best seen as focusing \non . . . matters of administrative convenience and efficiency, not on elements of a case or \ncontroversy within the meaning of the Constitution.” United Food & Com. Workers Union \nLoc. 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 557 (1996). “Individualized proof from the members \nis not needed where, as here, declaratory and injunctive relief is sought rather than monetary \ndamages.” Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. Metro. Water Dist. of S. Cal., 159 F. 3d 1178, \n1181 (9th Cir. 1998); see also Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry \nGoods Corp., 799 F.2d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1986) (explaining that “[a]ctions for declaratory, injunctive \nand other forms of prospective relief have generally been held particularly suited to group \n \n33 Regarding the first two elements of the test, the Federation includes among its \nmembers the other Plaintiff in this case, Oregon Humanities, which has standing to bring this \nlawsuit. The Federation also is “the national membership organization for the state and \njurisdictional humanities councils” and “advocates for increased investment in and engagement \nwith the national network of humanities councils.” Stein Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6. The interests it asserts in \nthis case are thus germane to its purposes. \nPAGE 71 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 72 of 81\nrepresentation” and that when courts “are concerned only with the question of preliminary \ninjunctive relief, the participation of plaintiff’s individual members is not necessary to litigate \n[the] action” where the “nub” of the claim depends on the plaintiff’s evidence, “not on evidence \nthat differs from member to member”); Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Tex. Med. \nBd., 627 F.3d 547, 551 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting that the associational standing doctrine generally \nwould bar an action for damages, unlike an action for declaratory and injunctive relief).  \nApplying these principles, the Court finds that the individual participation of each \nCouncil is not required. First, Plaintiffs have provided declarations and other submissions \ndiscussing harms experienced by a representative sample of member Councils. See generally \nECF 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 36-1.34 Additionally, although the specific number of terminated \ngrants may vary from Council to Council, the Federation’s claims in this case depend not on \nevidence that differs from Council to Council, but whether Defendants’ decision to mass \nterminate grant funding to the Federal/State Partnership violates federal law and constitutional \nprinciples. Accordingly, the Court joins other district courts around the country that have \nconcluded in similar contexts that associations have standing to bring cases on behalf of their \nmembers. See, e.g., Ass’n of Am. Univs. v. Dep’t of Energy, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 \nWL 1414135, at *8 (D. Mass. May 15, 2025); Am. Council, 2025 WL 2097738, at *20. \nIn other words, what Plaintiffs request is not a universal injunction. They do not request \nan injunction applying to “any person” or against Defendants writ large. Plaintiffs’ request for \nrelief properly is limited to themselves, and for the Federation, within the relief afforded by \ndirect and associational standing. Within the principles of direct and associational standing, the \n \n34 The exhibit in ECF 36-1 is a letter provided by Plaintiffs that discusses the termination \nof a grant provided directly to an organization in Mississippi but is “nearly identical” to the \ntermination notice that the MHC received concerning its general operating support grant.   \nPAGE 72 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 73 of 81\nCourt properly may order injunctive relief for the Federation’s members. Cf. Ass’n of Am. Univs. \nv. Dep’t of Def., --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 2022628, at *28 (D. Mass. July 18, 2025) \n(explaining that after an association has established standing to sue on behalf of its members, “no \nadditional showing is necessary to afford relief to all . . . members” of that association).  \n2.  Venue \nDefendants argue that “venue in Oregon appears inappropriate” because “Plaintiffs’ \nmemo indicates that the non-Oregon members of the Federation are impacted locally or within \ntheir individual states; there is no tie to the District of Oregon.” The Court disagrees that venue is \ninappropriate. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C), civil actions in which the defendant is “an \nofficer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or \nunder color of legal authority, or an agency of the United States, or the United States,” may be \nbrought in, among other venues, the judicial district where “the plaintiff resides if no real \nproperty is involved in the action.” No real property is involved in this action.35  \nThus, the Court considers whether at least one of the two Plaintiffs resides within the \nDistrict of Oregon. See Ry. Lab. Execs.’ Ass’n v. ICC, 958 F.2d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 1991) \n \n35 “The Ninth Circuit has not addressed the meaning of ‘real property’ in § 1391(e)[].” \nCtr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 2009 WL 1025606, at *2 (N.D. Cal. \nApr. 14, 2009). Indeed, the only opinion issued by the Ninth Circuit defining “real property” of \nwhich the Court is aware is unpublished. See Gabriel v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 547 F. App’x 829, \n832 (9th Cir. 2013) (“Real property includes ‘land and anything grown on, attached to, or erected \non it, excluding anything that may be severed without injury to the land.’” (citing Black’s Law \nDictionary 1255 (8th ed. 2004)). Accordingly, the Court uses the definition of “real property” \nprovided by the District of Nevada: “an action involves real property if it is a suit involving the \nprotection or recovery of real property or an estate therein.” Ferguson v. Lieurance, 565 F. \nSupp. 1013, 1015 (D. Nev. 1983); see also Santa Fe Int’l Corp. v. Watt, 580 F. Supp. 27, 30 (D. \nDel. 1984) (indicating that real property issues arise when a court confronts problems “which are \nrecurrent but peculiar to certain areas . . . such as mineral rights” (quotation marks omitted)). \nNeither party suggests—and the Court does not find—that the protection or recovery of real \nproperty or an estate is at issue here, or for that matter, that this case falls into any of the other \ndefinitions discussed in this footnote.  \nPAGE 73 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 74 of 81\n(explaining that venue need be proper only for one plaintiff under § 1391(e)(1)(C));36 Exxon \nCorp. v. FTC, 588 F.2d 895, 898-99 (3d Cir. 1978) (“There is no requirement that all plaintiffs \nreside in the forum district.”), overruled on other grounds as recognized in Reifer v. Westport \nIns. Corp., 751 F.3d 129, 138-39 (3d Cir. 2014); Sidney Coal Co., Inc. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 \nF.3d 336, 344-46 (6th Cir. 2005) (collecting cases and reviewing legislative history of § 1391(e) \nto conclude that the provision’s residency requirement is satisfied if at least one plaintiff resides \nin the district in which the action has been brought), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1020 (2006). \nDefendants do not contest that Oregon Humanities resides in the District of Oregon, or that the \nDistrict of Oregon is an improper venue for that Plaintiff. Thus, venue is proper with respect to \none Plaintiff, and accordingly, the District of Oregon is an appropriate venue for this case. Cf. \nLas Ams. Immigr. Advoc. Ctr. v. Trump, 475 F. Supp. 3d 1194, 1202 (D. Or. 2020) (“Where \nthere are multiple plaintiffs, only one plaintiff must be a resident of the district to satisfy the \nresidency requirement of venue under § 1391(e)(1)(C).” (citing Ry. Lab. Execs. Ass’n, 958 F.2d \nat 256)), on recon. sub nom. Las Ams. Immigr. Advoc. Ctr. v. Biden, 571 F. Supp. 3d 1173 (D. \nOr. 2021); Am. Council, 2025 WL 2097738, at *18 (finding that venue was proper because some \nof the plaintiffs resided in the court’s district and because no real property was involved in the \naction). \n3.  Stay Under § 705 of the APA \nDefendants’ third argument is that the scope of relief available against NEH under the \nAPA must be consistent with the principles of CASA. Defendants assert that although the APA \npermits courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action,” see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), “that \n \n36 Railway Labor Executives Ass’n precisely states that “venue need be proper for only \none plaintiff under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(4).” See 958 F.2d at 256. For clarification purposes, the \nCourt notes that this provision of the statute has since been renumbered as § 1391(e)(1)(C).  \nPAGE 74 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 75 of 81\nlanguage may not be equated with the wholesale vacatur of agency action.” The Court does not \nfind Defendants’ argument persuasive.  \nFirst, what Plaintiffs request at this stage of the litigation is not “vacatur of agency \naction” under § 706(2) of the APA. Plaintiffs request a stay under § 705. Under § 705, when \n“justice so requires” and “to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury,” a reviewing \ncourt may “issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an \nagency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” In \nother words, a stay under § 705 functions like a prohibitory injunction; the stay preserves the \nstatus quo and does not impose additional obligations on an agency or vacate agency action \naltogether. Because Plaintiffs do not request vacatur under § 706(2) at this time, the Court \ndeclines further to address Defendants’ arguments about the extent to which the text of § 706(2) \ncomports with CASA.  \nSecond, the Court does not agree with Defendants that relief granted under the APA must \ncomport with the principles of CASA, because CASA is not a case about § 705 stays. The only \nmention of the APA in CASA is in the context of § 706 vacaturs, and only to emphasize that \n“[n]othing” in the CASA decision “resolves the distinct question whether the Administrative \nProcedure Act authorizes federal courts to vacate federal agency action.” 145 S. Ct. at 2554 n.10; \nsee also id. at 2567 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (“To be sure, in the wake of the Court’s \ndecision, . . . in cases under the Administrative Procedure Act, plaintiffs may ask a court to \npreliminarily ‘set aside’ a new agency rule.”); Ass’n of Am. Univs. v. Dep’t of Def., 2025 \nWL 2022628, at *27 (noting that “the Court does not necessarily agree that a stay under the APA \nis subject to the same limitations espoused in CASA”); but see Immigr. Defs. Law Ctr., 2025 \nWL 2080742, at *15 (stating that although CASA “explicitly declined to extend its holding to the \nPAGE 75 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 76 of 81\nAPA context, its complete-relief principle for crafting injunctive relief provides some useful \nguidance for crafting interim equitable relief” (citation omitted)). To the extent that the principles \nsupporting the Supreme Court’s decision in CASA apply to a § 705 stay, Plaintiffs’ requested \nstay to protect the named Plaintiffs, including by association the Federation’s member Councils, \ncomports with the theory that relief must be complete, not universal.  \nHaving addressed Defendants’ arguments, the Court turns to the appropriateness and \nscope of a § 705 stay. For the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs have met their burden to show \nthat a stay is appropriate.   \n4.  Conclusion \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs’ requested relief, as clarified at oral argument, is \nprohibitory and narrowly tailored. Enjoining Defendants and staying the NEH Defendants from \nimplementing the April 2nd grant terminations and directing Defendants not to re-obligate \npendente lite to another party the unlawfully withdrawn grant funding is narrowly tailored to the \nclaimed harm in this case.  \nE.  Administrative Stay and Bond  \n1.  Defendants’ Request for an Administrative Stay  \n  Defendants request that if the Court issues injunctive relief, that relief be stayed pending \nthe disposition of any appeal authorized by the Solicitor General of the United States or, at a \nminimum, administratively stayed for a period of seven days to allow the government to seek an \nemergency stay from the court of appeals. The Court denies this relief.  \n  When determining whether to enter this type of a stay, a court considers the following \nfour factors: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nPAGE 76 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 77 of 81\nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \nNken, 556 U.S. at 426 (quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, a stay is not appropriate because Defendants satisfy none of these factors. First, for \nthe reasons discussed, Plaintiffs—not Defendants—have shown a likelihood of success on the \nmerits. Cf. Thakur, 2025 WL 1734471, at *31 (“Defendants’ request for a stay pending appeal, \nor for seven days pending a motion to the court of appeals for a stay, is also denied . . . because \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their APA and First Amendment claims.”); see \nalso Manrique v. Kolc, 65 F.4th 1037, 1041 (9th Cir. 2023) (denying a plaintiff’s motion to stay \nbecause he failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits). Second, Defendants have also \nmade “no showing that dispersing congressionally appropriated funds for statutorily mandated \npurposes would cause irreparable harm in this case.” Cmty. Legal Servs., 137 F.4th at 942. As \ndiscussed, Defendants are likely violating statutory obligations and principles of Separation of \nPowers that have existed for decades. Defendants “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that \nmerely ends an unlawful practice.” Id. at 943 (quoting Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, \n1145 (9th Cir. 2013).37 Third, the issuance of a stay would substantially injure Plaintiffs, who \nwill continue to suffer the loss and potential closure of state humanities programs. Cf. New York \n \n37 Defendants cite the Supreme Court’s opinion in California to support their concern that \na preliminary injunction could require the government to spend money not recoupable after \nbeing distributed. First, as noted above, Plaintiffs no longer seek relief requiring the government \nto spend any money. Rather, Plaintiffs request the Court to enjoin Defendants from spending \nthose allocated funds elsewhere. Thus, Defendants’ argument is moot. Second, as Judge Koh \nexplained in Community Legal Services, the Supreme Court in California “relied upon a \ndeclaration from a government official asserting the difficulties inherent in recovering disbursed \nfunds under the specific grant agreements in that case.” 137 F.4th at 943 (citing California, 145 \nS. Ct. at 969). Here, as in Community Legal Services, no such evidence was presented. “To the \ncontrary, [Defendants’] motion fails to cite any evidence [on Defendants’ ability to recoup] at \nall.” Id.  \nPAGE 77 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 78 of 81\nv. Kennedy, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1803260, at *21 (D.R.I. July 1, 2025) (denying \nagency’s request for stay in light of the plaintiffs’ assertion that a stay would result in “specific, \nconcrete, documented harms” (quotation marks omitted)). Finally, Defendants have offered no \nargument or evidence that the public interest supports a stay. To the contrary, for the reasons \nabove, the public interest benefits from immediate preliminary injunctive relief. Therefore, \nbecause Defendants have failed to satisfy the Nken factors, the Court denies their request for a \nstay. Cf. PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, 769 F. Supp. 3d 405, 454 (D. Md. 2025) (denying Defendants’ \nrequest for stay because they satisfied none of the four Nken factors).  \n2.  Defendants’ Request for a Bond  \nRule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that “[t]he court may issue a \npreliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an \namount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party \nfound to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” Federal courts, however, have discretion \nas to the amount of the security and whether to even require a security in the first place. See \nJohnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1086 (9th Cir. 2009) (“Rule 65(c) invests the district court \nwith discretion as to the amount of the security required, if any.” (emphasis in original) (cleaned \nup)); see also People of State of Cal. ex rel. Van De Kamp v. Tahoe Reg’l Plan. Agency, 766 \nF.2d 1319, 1325 (9th Cir.) (“The court has discretion to dispense with the security \nrequirement . . . where requiring security would effectively deny access to judicial review.”), \namended, 775 F.2d 998 (9th Cir. 1985).  \nDefendants request that any injunctive relief be conditioned on a bond. Defendants argue \nthat a bond is appropriate here because any preliminary injunction would “potentially mandate \nthat the government spend money not recoupable once distributed.” As discussed, Plaintiffs have \nPAGE 78 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 79 of 81\nwithdrawn that requested remedy. Thus, Defendants do not show any reasonable damages they \nmight potentially sustain. \nEven if Defendants could show a possibility of damages, the Court has considered the \nrelative hardships and the likelihood of success on the merits and concludes that to require any \nsecurity in this case would be unjust. As a result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs face \nirreparable harm to their ability to fund local humanities projects. Requiring a bond would \nconstrain Plaintiffs’ ability to enforce their rights. See Cmty. Legal Servs. in E. Palo Alto v. U.S. \nDep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1233674, at *13 (N.D. Cal. \nApr. 29, 2025) (“Because this litigation is brought by nonprofit organizations to protect the \npublic interest and ensure compliance with federal law, the Court declines the Government’s \nrequest [for a bond].”); PFLAG, 769 F. Supp. 3d at 454 (“Because the Court has found that \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the withholding of the funds at issue in this \ncase is unconstitutional, the Court again declines to require a bond.”); Nat’l Ass’n of Diversity \nOfficers in Higher Educ. v. Trump, 767 F. Supp. 3d 243, 291 (D. Md.)

Supp. 3d 465 (D. Md. 2025).38 Because this litigation is brought to protect the \n \n38 The Court acknowledges that other courts, including courts in this circuit, have chosen \nto impose nominal bonds instead of no bond at all. See, e.g., S.F. A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, --- F. \nSupp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1621636, at *29 (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2025) (imposing bond of $1,000); S. \nEduc. Found., 2025 WL 1453047, at *18 (imposing bond of $100); Thakur, 2025 WL 1734471, \nat *31 (imposing bond of $100); New York v. Kennedy, 2025 WL 1803260, at *21 (imposing \nbond of $100). Here, Defendants did not request, nor does the Court see the value in imposing, a \nnominal or symbolic bond. Indeed, Defendants did not propose any amount for the requested \nbond. \nPAGE 79 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 39      Filed 08/06/25      Page 80 of 81\npublic interest and ensure compliance with federal law, the Court concludes that requiring \nPlaintiffs to post a bond is not needed. \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction and until this Court orders otherwise and except as otherwise expressly \npermitted by this Preliminary Injunction, or until such time as the parties agree in writing to \namend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction: \n1.

Financial support from state and jurisdictional humanities councils reaches nearly \nevery corner of every state and jurisdiction of the United States, enabling our Nation to preserve \nand honor the stories, cultures, ideas, practices, and experiences of all Americans. State and \njurisdictional humanities councils are a creature of statute. 20 U.S.C. § 956(f).  And by statute, \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities (“NEH”) has funded our state and jurisdictional \ncouncils for the past half-century with broad, bipartisan support.  \n2.  The United States DOGE Service (“DOGE”) brought the core work of those \ncouncils to a screeching halt in March and April 2025, when DOGE gutted the NEH and \nterminated almost all grants issued to the state and jurisdictional councils by the prior \nAdministration with no reasoned analysis and with total disregard for the Congressionally \nmandated role of councils: to ensure that funding for locally-directed humanities programing \nreaches every part of the United States. \n3.  This lawsuit challenges the disruption and attempted destruction, spearheaded by \nDOGE, of the statutory Federal/State partnership (“Federal/State Partnership”) between the NEH \nand the fifty-six state and jurisdictional humanities.  We ask the Court to stop this imminent \nthreat to our Nation’s historic and critical support of the humanities by enjoining NEH from \nfundamentally altering the Federal/State Partnership, antithetical to Congressional intent, and in \nviolation of Congress’s instructions in its annual appropriations bills for the agency.   \nThe Background. \n4.  In 1965, Congress declared that “[t]he arts and the humanities belong to all the \npeople of the United States” and accordingly established the NEH.  20 U.S.C. § 953(a); § 956. \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \nPAGE 2 – AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 3 of 41\n \n5.  According to a long-time NEH mission statement, “[b]ecause democracy \ndemands wisdom, the NEH serves and strengthens our republic by promoting excellence in the \n1\nhumanities and conveying the lessons of history to all Americans.”  \n6.  Consistent with its mission, and with historically bipartisan support from \nCongress and administrations of both political parties, the NEH has funded humanities programs \nthroughout the country since 1965. \n7.  In 1972, Congress amended the NEH statutes to provide for the creation of grants-\nin-aid programs in each of the states and territories of the United States. From 1972 forward, the \nNEH has funded state and jurisdictional humanities councils through congressional \nappropriations to the federal agency.   \n8.  From the beginning of this Federal/State Partnership, it was clear that \nCongressional intent was that the state and jurisdictional humanities councils would act as a \ncrucial bridge between the NEH in Washington, D.C. and widely-dispersed local communities in \neach of the states and jurisdictions. The councils serve this intermediary role by delivering \nprogramming and distributing federal funds to local community grantees across the country.  \n9.  The NEH statutes provide that states and jurisdictions of the United States shall \nreceive NEH funding by establishing grant recipient organizations with up to 25% of board \nmembers appointed by an officer or agency of such state. See 20 U.S.C. § 956(2)(B).  Each of \nthe states and territories whose humanities councils are involved in this litigation have formed \nSection 501(c)(3) nonprofit state humanities councils, which together constitute the membership \nof Plaintiff Federation of State Humanities Councils (“Federation”). \n10.  For example, in 1971, Oregon created the Oregon Council for the Humanities, \ndoing business as Oregon Humanities (“Oregon Humanities), as a Section 501(c)(3) organization \nto distribute NEH funds to public humanities projects in communities all over Oregon.  The \n \n \n1\n See, e.g., National Endowment for the Humanities: Strategic Plan FY 2007–FY 2012,  \nhttps://usinfo.org/enus/life/artsent/strategicplan.html (last visited June 10, 2025).     \nPAGE 3 – AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 4 of 41\n \nGovernor of Oregon appoints up to 25% of the members to Oregon Humanities’ board of \ndirectors. As such, Oregon Humanities is funded by the NEH under 20 U.S.C. § 956(2)(B). Each \nof the other states and jurisdictions of the United States also has a 501(c)(3) humanities council \nand all but one humanities council is a member of the Federation. \nNEH Funding Preserves the History of our Cultures. \n11.  “[T]he humanities explore, interpret, and preserve the diversity of human cultures, \nideas, practices and experiences, past and present. They are the languages, religions, laws, \nphilosophies, and customs that make us distinct. They are our history and our cultures, the ideas \n2\nand movements that have shaped societies throughout time.”    \n12.  From Mississippi to South Dakota, Maine to California, the Northern Mariana \nIslands to Idaho, and places in between, NEH funding flows to state and jurisdictional \nhumanities councils who in turn support a multitude of local grass roots public humanities \nprograms throughout the Nation.  The local communities choose the humanities programming \nbest suited for their area – the content of humanities work funded by NEH is not top-down but \nrather inherently local. According to NEH, “[s]tate and jurisdictional humanities councils are the \n3\npublic humanities in action.”     \n13.  Indeed, here in Oregon, NEH dollars flowing through Oregon Humanities help \nfund humanities programming in every corner of the state—grants for rural libraries in \ncommunities such as Burns, Joseph, Blue River, Newport, and Forest Grove; funding for youth-\nled conversations about mental health in Medford; funding for storytelling projects led by Nez \nPerce Wallowa Homeland; the publication of a widely-distributed Oregon Humanities magazine \nfeaturing stories from all over the state; and so much more.  \n \n \n2\n About the National Endowment for the Humanities, https://www.neh.gov/about (last visited \nJune 10, 2025).     \n3\n Federal/State Partnership One Page Description, https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-\nfiles/Federal-State%20Partnership_one-page%20description_2020.pdf (last visited June 10, \n2025).   \nPAGE 4 – AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 5 of 41\n \n14.  NEH funding is critical to the survival of state and jurisdictional humanities \ncouncils and, in turn, critical to the survival of small, local humanities-based grantees.  By \nstatute, NEH funds a large portion of the cost of activities that meet the NEH statutory criteria \nfor each state and jurisdictional council. 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(1).   \n15.  NEH manages its relationships with the Federation and the member state and \njurisdictional humanities councils through its Office of Federal/State Partnership (“Fed/State”).  \nFed/State acts as the liaison between the NEH and the nonprofit network of state and \njurisdictional humanities councils, including the Federation. \nNEH Funding to the States & Jurisdictions is Mandatory.   \n16.  NEH funding for state and jurisdictional councils is mandatory. See, e.g., 20 \nU.S.C. § 956(f)(4).  Even NEH’s website describes it as such: “[b]y congressional mandate, \n[NEH] provides general operating support awards to support public humanities programming in \nthe 56 states and jurisdictions. Fed/State works with the designated humanities councils in each \n4\nstate and jurisdiction. The councils are Fed/State’s sole awardees.”   \n17.  Fed/State provides such general operating support awards and other grant funding \nto the Federation’s members “in order to bring humanities education, lifelong learning, and \npublic humanities programming to communities across the country. Fed/State collaborates with \n[the Federation’s members] to advance public understanding of the humanities, while enhancing \n5\npublic awareness of, access to, and support for the humanities on a local, grassroots level.”   \n18.  Each fiscal year, Congress appropriates funds for the NEH to carry out its \nstatutory functions, including awarding grants. Appropriations to state and jurisdictional councils \nare delineated in each fiscal year appropriation bill.   \n \n \n4\n National Endowment for the Humanities: Office of Federal/State Partnership, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/divisions/fedstate (last visited June 10, 2025) (emphasis added).  \n5\n Id.  \nPAGE 5 – AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 6 of 41\n \n19.  In Fiscal Year 2024, for example, Congress appropriated $207 million to NEH, of \n6\nwhich $65 million was directed to the councils through the Federal/State Partnership.    \n20.  The statutes provide mandatory formulas for allocating the funding specified for \nthe Federal/State Partnership among the state and jurisdictional councils once the money is \nappropriated.  For one example, 44% “of [certain fiscal year appropriations] shall be allotted in \nequal amounts among the States and grant recipients which have plans approved by the \nChairperson [of NEH]” and 22% “of [certain fiscal year appropriations] shall be allotted [based \nupon population of] the States and grant recipients which have plans approved by the \nChairperson [of NEH].”  20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4)(B)&(C).  \nNEH Funding is in Imminent Jeopardy. \n21.  The critical work of the NEH and its congressionally mandated financial support \nof the Federal/State Partnership is now in jeopardy. Since the first week of April 2025, the \ncurrent Administration and its United States DOGE Service have engaged in a concerted effort to \ndisrupt and destroy the work of the NEH and the Fed/State Office. These efforts are unlawful, \nand Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to seek relief for the immediate harms these efforts are causing to \nthe Federation, its members, and those members’ many grant recipients.  \n22.  Defendants’ destructive efforts have taken the form of failing to provide notice \nand an opportunity to be heard prior to and after eliminating grant funding or modifying grants; \nterminating and partially rescinding grants without statutory authority; terminating grants with \nno requisite statutory findings by Defendant McDonald;  eliminating all but one staff person \nfrom the Fed/State office causing work in that office to slow to a crawl; across-the-board delays \nin the review and approval of otherwise approved grant reimbursements; delays and changes in \npending grant applications; widespread terminations of already-issued grants without appeal \n \n \n6\n National Endowment for the Humanities: FY 2024 Appropriations, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2024-\n08/FY%202024%20Appropriations%20Breakdown%20New%20Logo%20small.pdf (last visited \nJue 10, 2025).  \nPAGE 6 – AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 7 of 41\n \nopportunities; and arbitrary and capricious changes to grant application processes and \nprocedures.  Plaintiffs challenge all of these unconstitutional disruptions under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act (APA). \n23.  In May 2025, the NEH submitted a Fiscal Year 2026 Congressional Justification \nwhich lays bare the agency’s plan to “conduct an orderly shutdown of the Agency” by Fiscal \n7\nYear 2026.  \n24.  Defendants’ actions also contravene the separation-of-powers constraints on the \nExecutive Branch—and so also violate the Constitution. The Constitution grants Congress—not \nthe President—the power to create and prescribe the duties of federal agencies, and Congress \nmaintains the exclusive power of the purse in directing how federal funds must be spent.  The \nNEH may not refuse to spend funds that Congress has appropriated for the Federal/State \nPartnership.  \n25.  The challenged delays and grant terminations have caused—and, if left \nunchecked, will continue to cause—direct, immediate, significant, and irreparable harm to the \nFederation and its members.   \n26.  The Federation and its members are collectively awaiting NEH’s decisions on \nhundreds of thousands of dollars of requested humanities grants, including funds already \nappropriated by Congress and approved by NEH.  In April, the NEH terminated general \noperating and support grants already issued to the Federation’s members, clawing back millions \nof dollars (and counting) in already-awarded money.  The result of these disruptions has been \ndevastating to the Federation’s members.   \n27.  State and jurisdictional humanities councils have terminated staff, cancelled \nplanned events with community groups, ended promised support for libraries, schools, and \n \n \n7\n National Endowment for the Humanities: Fiscal Year 2026 Congressional Justification, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/NEH%20FY%202026%20Congressional%20Justificatio\nn.pdf (last visited June 10, 2025).   \nPAGE 7 – AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 8 of 41\n \nfamilies, terminated reading and writing programming, history programs, and more.  Several \nstate and jurisdictional humanities councils are at risk of closing permanently.  \n28.  The Federation itself will be damaged by loss of member dues and risks closing \ndue to lack of funding.    \n29.  On June 2, 2025, after this action and other actions were filed challenging \nDefendants’ lawless actions, the agency attempted to partially rescind its April 2 General \nOperating Support grant termination letters, but that attempted partial rescission did not remedy \nthe harm caused by the terminations, as set forth in more detail below.  The June 2 \ncommunication reinforced NEH’s intention to cut promised funding to the councils by at least \nhalf, again without offering notice and an opportunity to challenge the action.   \n30.  For all these reasons, Plaintiffs seek relief from this Court.  The Court should \nvacate NEH’s arbitrary and capricious and unlawful grant termination and partial rescission \ndecisions; order the NEH to undertake the grant-application review process as the law requires; \norder NEH to follow the instructions provided in Congressional appropriations concerning the \nFederal/State program; order NEH to apply the statutory criteria and formulas when making \ngrant determinations to the councils; order NEH to process advance and reimbursement \napplications for funding in normal course; and order NEH to provide notice and an opportunity \nfor a hearing and/or to appeal NEH decisions as required by law.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n31.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate these claims because this \naction arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, 28 U.S.C. § 1331; because \nDefendants are United States officials, 28 U.S.C. § 1356(a)(2); and because this case arises under \nthe judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. \n32.  This Court may grant declaratory, injunctive, and other relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706, and the Court’s inherent authority to enjoin federal \nofficials from acting unlawfully. \nPAGE 8 – AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 9 of 41\n \n33.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  Defendants are \nfederal agencies and officers sued in their official capacity.  Plaintiff Oregon Council of \nHumanities (“Oregon Humanities”), also a member of Plaintiff Federation of State Humanities \nCouncils, is a resident of this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n34.  Plaintiff Oregon Humanities is a nonprofit corporation created in 1971 to \ndistribute NEH funds to public humanities projects in communities all over Oregon.  The NEH is \nOregon Humanities’ largest funder and oldest partner.  Oregon Humanities is also a member of \nthe Federation. \n35.  Founded in 1977, Plaintiff Federation of State Humanities Councils is a nonprofit \norganization whose members include all but one of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities \n8\ncouncils.   Through advocacy, events, partnerships, and shared resources, the Federation unites \nthe work and voices of our Nation’s humanities councils.  Its mission is to advocate for increased \ninvestment in and engagement with the national network of humanities councils and to support, \nconnect, and amplify the work and voices of its members, demonstrating the councils’ value for \ncommunities and their collective impact on civic health and cultural vibrancy.  Both the \nFederation and its members receive grant funding directly from the NEH.  As described in more \ndetail below, the Federation and its members have been substantially injured by the recent \nactions of, or in the name of, NEH.   \n36.

Defendant Amy Gleason is the Acting Administrator of the United States DOGE \nService and is the DOGE’s highest ranking official. As such, she is responsible for activities of \nthe organization. She is sued in her official capacity only. \n38.  Defendant National Endowment for the Humanities is an agency of the United \nStates government.  The National Council on the Humanities is an advisory council “established \nin the National Endowment for the Humanities” pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 957. \n39.  Defendant Michael McDonald is the Acting Chairman of the National \nEndowment for the Humanities.  Defendant McDonald is a member of the National Council on \nthe Humanities.  He is sued in his official capacity only. \nFACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND \n“Democracy demands wisdom.” \nI.  Congress Establishes NEH \n40.  Finding that “[t]he arts and the humanities belong to all people of the United \nStates,” 20 U.S.C. § 951(1), Congress created the NEH and its sister agency, the National \nEndowment for the Arts (“NEA”), in 1965, as part of the National Foundation on the Arts and \nHumanities Act of 1965 (“NFAHA” or “the Act”). Pub. L. 89-209, 79 Stat. 845 (Sept. 29, 1965) \n(codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 951-60). \n41.  In establishing the NEH, Congress found that “it is necessary and appropriate for \nthe Federal Government to complement, assist, and add to programs for the advancement of the \nhumanities and the arts by local, State, regional, and private agencies and their organizations.” \nId. § 951(5). Congress believed that the federal government has a key role in “help[ing] create \nand sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry but also \nthe material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent.” Id. § 951(7). \n42.  Accordingly, Congress established the NEH to provide funding for organizations \nand individuals involved in research, publication of scholarly works, and promotion of the \nhumanities. See 20 U.S.C. § 956. \nPAGE 10 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 11 of 41\n \n43.  Congress viewed this directive as a broad one, meant to fund a wide range of \nprojects and not to promote a singular viewpoint, and to fund traditionally underrepresented \nrecipients. See 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). \n44.  To that end, in creating NEH, Congress included several provisions aimed at \nprotecting the agency from political influence. For example, Congress has prohibited federal \nagencies and employees from “exercis[ing] any direction, supervision, or control over the policy \ndetermination, personnel, or curriculum” of any grantee organization.  20 U.S.C. § 953(c). \n45.  This statutory framework demonstrates Congress’s intent to insulate NEH from \npolitical control. As a Senate committee report explained: “It is the intent of the committee that \nin the administration of this act there be given the fullest attention to freedom of artistic and  \nhumanistic expression. . . . [N]o undue preference should be given to any particular style or \nschool of thought or expression.” S. Rep. No. 80-300, at 3–4 (1965). \n46.  With this broad purpose in mind, Congress provided that the Chairperson of the \nNEH may “enter into arrangements,” including “contracts, grants, loans, and other forms of \nassistance,” to further a limited set of purposes.  20 U.S.C. § 956(c).  These purposes include to: \n  develop and encourage the pursuit of a national policy for the promotion \nof progress and scholarship in the humanities; \n  initiate and support research and programs to strengthen the research and \nteaching potential of the United States in the humanities by making \narrangements with individuals or groups to support such activities; \n  initiate and support training and workshops in the humanities by making \narrangements with institutions or individuals; \n  initiate and support programs and research which have substantial \nscholarly and cultural significance and that reach, or reflect the diversity \nand richness of our American cultural heritage, including the culture of, a \nminority, inner city, rural, or tribal community; \n  foster international programs and exchanges; \nPAGE 11 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 12 of 41\n \n  foster the interchange of information in the humanities; \n  foster, with groups, education in, and public understanding and \nappreciation of the humanities; \n  support the publication of scholarly works in the humanities; \n  ensure that the benefit of its programs will also be available to our citizens \nwhere such programs would otherwise be unavailable due to geographic or \neconomic reasons; and \n  foster programs and projects that provide access to, and preserve materials \nimportant to research, education, and public understanding of, the \nhumanities. \nId. \n47.  In addition, Congress provided for three additional types of grant programs \nincluding grants in aid programs in each state, at issue here. 20 U.S.C. § 956 (f). \n48.  As discussed throughout, the Federal/State Partnership established by 20 U.S.C. § \n956 (f) is the focus of this litigation.  While NEH provides grant funding for other programs, the \nFederal/State Partnership has historically constituted the largest portion of the Congressional \nappropriations for the agency and funding for this partnership is mandatory. \n49.  Through its programs, the NEH has played a significant role in both expanding \naccess to the humanities and funding a wide range of research, training, and education.  \n50.  The NEH’s chair, currently Defendant McDonald, is advised by the National \nCouncil on the Humanities, a board of twenty-six “distinguished private citizens appointed by \n9\nthe president and confirmed by the Senate”  (the “Council”).  20 U.S.C. § 957.  \n51.  One of the statutory functions of the Council is to “review applications for \nfinancial support and make recommendations thereon to the Chairperson. The Chairperson shall \n \n \n9\n About the National Council on the Humanities, https://www.neh.gov/about/national-council-\non-the-humanities (last visited June 10, 2025).  \nPAGE 12 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 13 of 41\n \nnot approve or disapprove any such application until the Chairperson has received the \nrecommendation of the Council on such application, unless the Council fails to make a \nrecommendation thereon within a reasonable time.”  Id. at § 957 (f). \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Typical Receipt of NEH Grants Funding \n“State councils enrich lives through the humanities—with an emphasis on the specific \n10\nneeds of the communities they represent.”  \n52.  The Federation’s members depend heavily on NEH funding to support their \nhumanities programming. At any given time, individual state and jurisdictional humanities \ncouncils may depend on multiple NEH grants that support their operations and fund local and \ngrassroots humanities organizations in the respective United States territory, such as libraries, \nteachers, and humanities-focused community groups. \n53.  State and jurisdictional councils apply to NEH for general operating support \ngrants (often referred to as “GOS grants”) in response to a NEH Notice of Funding Opportunity \n(“NOFO”).  The NOFO for each Fiscal Year Congressional appropriation outlines the steps that \ncouncils must take to request a general operating support grant.  Typically, the annual general \noperating support NOFO is posted in January or February each year.  \n54.  Once councils submit application materials to the NEH, they await award \ndecisions, which are announced via a system called eGMS. eGMS Reach is the system for \napplication review, award management, and official communications at NEH.  Award decisions, \ncalled Notice of Actions, set out the amount of funds awarded to the council for the general \noperating support grant.  The amount of money in the pool to make award decisions is governed \nby Congressional appropriations and determined by Congressional instruction. \n55.  General operating support grants for state and jurisdictional councils are for a \nthree-year period with funds available for five years. These grants provide stability to the \n \n \n10\n National Endowment for the Humanities: Office of Federal/State Partnership, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/divisions/fedstate (last visited June 10, 2025) \nPAGE 13 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 14 of 41\n \nFederation and its member councils, permitting the councils to pursue programs and activities in \naccordance with their respective annual plans.  Each of the Federation’s members relies upon \ngeneral operating support grants. \n56.  Councils receive the NEH general operating support grant funding in one of two \nways. They may ask for funds in advance for a particular expense. The majority of funds, \nhowever, are reimbursements. Councils pay expenses directly, then seek reimbursement through \neGMS under the relevant operating grant.  Until April 2, 2025, the NEH routinely and rapidly \nreimbursed councils for these expenses (generally within five to seven business days) as the \noutlay of money had already been approved by the NEH as mandated by Congress. \n57.  To better illustrate the above system, consider Oregon Humanities. Oregon \nHumanities applied for and was approved for a general operating support grant that spans \nNovember 1, 2022, to October 31, 2027.  An NEH Notice of Action approved $2,580,205 in \nfunding for this grant.  The grant constituted approximately 50% of Oregon Humanities’ budget \neach year.  To date, NEH has awarded and reimbursed $2,029,271 in funds under this grant.  \nOregon Humanities submitted an additional $292,000 in reimbursement requests for expenses \nthrough March 31, 2025, which, as discussed in more detail below, have not been processed by \nNEH.  An additional $258,934 is available under this grant during Fiscal Year 2025. \n58.  In response to a NOFO, Oregon Humanities submitted an application for a new \ngeneral operating support grant for November 1, 2025 to October 31, 2030.  That grant \napplication has not been processed by NEH. \n59.  Each member of the Federation is in a similar position:  all have general operating \nsupport grants that have been awarded but not fully paid.  Many have unreimbursed expenses \nheld up at NEH.  Some have requested and not received advanced funds.  All have received \ntermination notices and/or partial rescission notices for existing grants, including but not limited \nto general operating support grants.  And NEH is not processing new operating grant \napplications in normal course.  \nPAGE 14 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 15 of 41\n \n60.  In addition to standard operating grants, councils may apply for and receive grant \nfunding by applying for special initiative funding offered by NEH or for competitive grant \nopportunities.  These funding opportunities are regularly posted on the NEH website and \nannounced through eGMS. \n61.  Special initiative grants are “non-competitive grants.”  In other words, unlike \ngeneral operating support grants, councils may or may not apply for funding for particular \nprojects announced by the NEH chair. If a special initiative grant is offered to the full range of \ncouncils, only councils interested in that funding opportunity will apply. \n62.  For example, in 2025 Oregon Humanities applied for funding through a second \nround of NEH’s United We Stand special initiative and was awarded $40,000 in grant funds.  \nThose funds have already been expended by Oregon Humanities, but not reimbursed by NEH.  \nSeveral other members of the Federation have not been reimbursed by NEH for their United We \nStand special initiative grants. \nIII.  Congressional Appropriations to NEH Amount to Hundreds of Millions of Dollars \nEach Fiscal Year, Most of Which is for Grantmaking \n“The councils bring humanities education, lifelong learning, and public humanities \n11\nprogramming to local communities throughout the country.”  \n63.  Overall, from Fiscal Year 1966 to 2025, Congress generally increased NEH \nfunding annually, which is consistent with NEH’s stable, and generally increasing funding to the \n12\nFederal/State Partnership for nearly sixty years, under administrations of both political parties.    \n \n \n11\n National Endowment for the Humanities: Impact in States & Jurisdictions, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/impact/states (last visited June 10, 2025).  \n12\n National Endowment for the Humanities: NEH Appropriations: FY 1966–2024, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2024-\n08/NEH%20Appropriations%202024%20center.pdf (last visited June 10, 2025).  \nPAGE 15 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 16 of 41\n \n13\nThe Federal/State Partnership is historically the largest program in NEH’s budget.   The \nappropriations bills from 2021 to 2024 are summarized in this chart prepared by the \nCongressional Research Service: \n \n64.  Congress’s appropriations to NEH for Fiscal Year 2024 were no different. \nConsistent with past appropriations for NEH activities, in the Further Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2024 (2024 CAA), Congress appropriated $207 million to NEH, of which \n$192 million “shall be available for support of activities in the humanities, pursuant to section \n \n \n13\n Loane, Shannon S., National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities: FY2024 Appropriations \n(CRS Report No. R48255 (Nov. 6, 2024) https://www.congress.gov/crs-\nproduct/R48255?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22National+Foundation+on+the+Arts+and+Hum\nanities%3A+FY2024+Appropriations%22%7D&s=1&r=1   \nPAGE 16 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 17 of 41\n \n7(c) [20 U.S.C. § 956(c)] of the Act and for administering the functions of the Act.”  (emphasis \nadded).  $65 million of that $192 million was further specifically directed to the Federal/State \nPartnership.  This money was designated for grants, operations, loans, contracts, and other \nassistance to further the enumerated purposes set forth under 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). Pub. L. 118-42, \n138 Stat. 25, 282 (Mar. 9, 2024) (the “2024 Act”). \n65.  Congress has not enacted a Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n2025, but on March 15, 2025, the President signed the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and \nExtensions Act 2025, commonly known as a “Continuing Resolution” or “CR” (2025 CR).  Pub. \nL. 119-4, §§ 1101-08, 139 Stat. 9, 10-12.  Pursuant to the 2025 CR, Congress appropriated \n“[s]uch amounts as may be necessary . . . under the authority and conditions provided in \napplicable appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2024, for projects or activities . . . that are not \notherwise specifically provided for, and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were \nmade available” in the specific appropriations Acts. Id., div A, § 1101(a), 139 Stat. at 11.  NEH \nthus received an additional $207 million that it must spend, including an additional $192 million \nthat it must spend on grants and other assistance programs under 20 U.S.C. § 956(c), and $65 \nmillion of that $192 million was further specifically directed to the Federal/State Partnership. \n66.  The 2025 CR extended congressional appropriations to the NEH through \nSeptember 30, 2025.  State and jurisdictional councils should have received Notices of Action \ntied to existing operating grants following the 2025 CR.  For example, Oregon Humanities’ \nfunding should have increased by an additional $578,000 based upon this appropriation, bringing \nits total award for its operating grant to $3,140,000.  That Notice of Action was never provided. \n67.  The Federation and its members have not received Notices of Action for the \nCongressionally mandated funds from the 2025 CR.   \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \nPAGE 17 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 18 of 41\n \nIV.  The NEH Enacting Statutes Set Forth Mandatory Formulas for Allocation of \nAppropriated Funds Among the State and Jurisdictional Humanities Councils. \n68.  Once Congress appropriates funds to NEH, the primary NEH enacting statute, 20 \nU.S.C. § 956, contains instructions for how NEH is to distribute the funds via the Federal/State \nPartnership.   \n69.  To be eligible for receipt of NEH funds, each state or jurisdictional humanities \ncouncil must first “submit an application for such assistance at such time as shall be specified by \nthe Chairperson [of NEH]. Each such application shall be accompanied with a plan” that sets out \ncertain requirements.  20 U.S.C. § 956 (f)(3).  All of the state and jurisdictional humanities \ncouncils have plans approved by the Chairperson as of the time of filing this Amended \nComplaint.  \n70.  The statutes provide that certain allocations of appropriated funds are left to the \ndiscretion of the Chairperson of NEH.  For example, “in any case where the sums available to \ncarry out this subsection for any fiscal year are in excess of [$200,000 to each state and \njurisdictional humanities council], “34 per centum of the amount of such excess for such fiscal \nyear shall be available to the Chairperson for making grants under this subsection to States and \nregional groups and entities applying for such grants.”  20 U.S.C. § 956 (f)(4)(A). \n71.  Other allocation formulas are not discretionary once the Chairperson has \napproved a council’s plan: “44 per centum of the amount of such excess for such fiscal year shall \nbe allotted in equal amounts among the States and grant recipients which have plans \napproved by the Chairperson” and 22% “of [certain fiscal year appropriations] shall be \nallotted [based upon population of] the States and grant recipients which have plans approved by \nthe Chairperson [of NEH].” See, e.g. id. at (4)(B)&(C). \n72.  As for 2024 appropriations, Congress directed NEH to “continue to provide no \nless than 40% of its program funds to support the work of these councils and maintain the \nlongstanding collaborative relationship between NEH and these councils.”  118th Cong 1st \nSession House of Representatives Report 118-155. \nPAGE 18 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 19 of 41\n \nV.  Federal Statutes and Regulations Provide a Process for Grant Termination \nIncluding Notice, Hearing, and an Opportunity to Cure. \n73.  Federal statutes provide that NEH grants to the Federation’s members, including \ntheir grants for general operating support, may be terminated only if the Chairperson of the NEH \nfinds that certain conditions occur.  See 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  As a prerequisite to termination, \nthe statutes require a finding by the NEH Chairperson “after reasonable notice and opportunity to \nbe heard.” 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  Such a prerequisite finding may be that a council (1) “is not \ncomplying substantially with the provisions” of the state council subsection of the statutes, (2) \n“is not complying substantially with terms and conditions of its State plan or grant recipient \napplication approved under” the same section, or (3) “any funds granted to [a council] have been \ndiverted from the purposes for which they are allotted.”  Id.  \n74.  If one of the above conditions occur, the statutes provide an opportunity to cure:  \n“The Chairperson shall immediately notify the Secretary of the Treasury and the [council] with \nrespect to which such finding was made that no further grants will be made under this subsection \nto such [council] until there is no longer a default or failure to comply or the diversion has been \ncorrected, or, if the compliance or correction is impossible, until such [council] repays or \narranges the repayment of the Federal funds which have been improperly diverted or expended.” \n75.  Uniform Administrative Requirements in the federal regulations further provide \nthat grants may be terminated by a federal agency if the recipient “fails to comply with the terms \nand conditions of the Federal award.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1).  Alternately, a grant may be \nterminated by the agency with the consent of the recipient where the two parties agree upon \ntermination conditions.  Id. at (2).  Finally, a grant may be terminated by the agency “pursuant to \nthe terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an \naward no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  Id. at (4).  \n76.  If an agency terminates a grant prior to the end of the grant period “due to the \nrecipient’s material failure to comply with the terms and conditions,” the agency is required to \nfollow a process including reporting the termination and other processes including providing the \nPAGE 19 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 20 of 41\n \ngrant recipient with opportunities to challenge the decision and appeal rights.  See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.342.   \n77.  Significantly, the regulations require an opportunity for objections and appeal.  \n(“The Federal agency must maintain written procedures for processing objections, hearings, and \nappeals. Upon initiating a remedy for noncompliance (for example . . . termination), the Federal \nagency must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information \nchallenging the action.  The Federal agency or pass-through entity must comply with any \nrequirements for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings to which the recipient or \nsubrecipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.”)  Id. \nVI.  DOGE Sweeps into NEH and Mass Terminates Grants and Staff. \n78.  The normal operations of NEH abruptly ended in March 2025.   \n79.  Before March, following President Trump’s election as President, NEH received a \nseries of instructions from the White House.  According to accounts of former or current NEH \nemployees, NEH staff were instructed to examine every open grant at NEH dating back to 2021 \nand determine whether each open grant ran afoul of any Executive Order (EO) issued by \nPresident Trump in his first days in office in 2025.  NEH staff were instructed to develop an \nExcel spreadsheet listing every grant and determine the level of risk that such grant ran afoul of \nEOs and to rate the risk from “low” to “serious” (the “Spreadsheet”).  NEH staff spent several \nworkdays in February and early March combing through grants to determine whether they \ninvolved DEI work, for example, rating the risk, and working on completing the Spreadsheet.  \n80.  NEH staff received little if any guidance for how to make such an assessment of \nopen grants or how to “rate” the risk that a standard operating grant implicated the President \nTrump EOs.  NEH staff at Fed/State examined open grants to the state and jurisdictional \nhumanities councils and generally rated such grants as “low” risk.   \n81.  On March 13, 2025, two days after President Trump signed the 2025 CR, NEH \nChair Shelly Lowe was directed by the White House to resign from her position.  \nPAGE 20 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 21 of 41\n \n82.  According to accounts of former and current NEH staff in March 2025, DOGE \npersonnel met with NEH leadership to discuss DOGE’s plans for NEH’s future. \n83.  DOGE has reportedly been deployed to multiple small agencies, in most cases to \nswiftly carry out mass terminations of staff, programs, and grants. \n84.  On April 1, 2025, NEH staff members reportedly were informed that DOGE \nsought reductions in NEH staff by 70-80% and “what could amount to a cancellation of all \n14\ngrants made under the Biden administration that have not been fully paid out.”    \n85.  Upon information and belief, DOGE did not use the Spreadsheet to assess \nwhether any grant constituted fraud, waste, or abuse, or implicated one of the EOs, but rather \nDOGE sought wholesale termination of any grant opened under the Biden Administration \nincluding all of the general operating support grants under the Federal/State Partnership. \n86.  Acting Chair Michael McDonald “told senior staff that [DOGE] . . . ‘wants to \n15\nclaw back $175 million’ in grant money that has not yet been disbursed.”    \n87.  While at the NEH, DOGE was provided one or more lists of open NEH grants, \nand DOGE repeatedly asserted that cancelling at least $175 million in grant money was an \nimperative.  According to accounts of former or current NEH employees, very shortly after \nreceiving the list of open NEH grants on April 2, 2025, DOGE agents emailed nearly 1,500 \ngrantees on the list informing the grantees that their grants were being terminated, including \nnearly all grants issued during the Biden Administration. \n88.  DOGE attempted to send to every state and jurisdictional humanities council a \ngrant termination notice for standard operating grants, as well as special opportunity and \n \n \n14\n Jennifer Schuessler, DOGE Demands Deep Cuts at Humanities Endowment, N.Y.

Most councils received the \ntermination notices in the middle of the night.  \n89.  DOGE did not process the grant terminations through NEH’s eGMS system as \nrequired by internal agency policies. \n90.  The emails received by NEH grantees did not come from an NEH server or email \naddress, but from Grant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com, a non-governmental email \naccount.  \n91.  The emails attached a grant termination letter purportedly signed by Acting \nDirector of NEH Michael McDonald.  The termination letters were not hand-signed by \nMcDonald or digitally signed with a verifiable digital signature.  Instead, the signature on the \ntermination letters was simply typed by someone as “/s/ Michael McDonald.” \n92.  In a meeting with staff to answer questions about the terminations, McDonald \nappeared to acknowledge that he did not determine which grants to terminate, nor did he draft \nthe termination letters.  First, he stated that he had explained NEH’s traditional termination \nprocess but that “as they said in the notification letter. . . they would not be adhering to \ntraditional notification processes” and “they did not feel those should be applied in this \ninstance.”  Further, in response to a question about the rationale for grant terminations, he replied \nthat the “rationale was simply because that’s the way DOGE had operated at other agencies and \n16\nthey applied the same methodology here.”   McDonald also said that any statement about the \nnumber of grants terminated would be “conjecture” on his part, even though he purportedly \nsigned each termination.  \n \n \n16\n NEH SLT Meeting Recording April 3, 2025 \nhttps://www.rev.com/app/transcript/NjgxMTE2MjgzOGFiYWRjZGM5NTIxYjk5ZEpYN0hBcV\nNYY0xJ/o/VEMwNDc3NTI1NjEz (last visited June 10, 2025).  \nPAGE 22 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 23 of 41\n \n93.  The termination letters to the Federation, its members, and Oregon Humanities \nsent on April 2 were nearly identical and lacked any individualized analysis or discussion of any \nterminated grant. \n  The letters contained the following explanation for termination: \nThis letter provides notice that the National Endowment for the \nHumanities  (NEH)  is  terminating  your  federal  grant  (Grant \nApplication No. XXXX) effective April 2, 2025, in accordance with \nthe termination clause in your Grant Agreement. \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities \nand conditions of the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination \ndue to several reasonable causes, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340. \nNEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact \nthat  the  NEH  is  repurposing  its  funding  allocations  in  a  new \ndirection in furtherance of the President’s agenda. The President’s \nFebruary 19, 2025 executive order mandates that the NEH eliminate \nall  non-statutorily  required  activities  and  functions.  See \nCommencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy, E.O. 14217 \n(Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate termination is necessary to \nsafeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal \npriorities. The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority \nfor  the  administration,  and  due  to  exceptional  circumstances, \nadherence to the traditional notification process is not possible. \nTherefore, the NEH hereby terminates your grant in its entirety \neffective April 2, 2025. \n94.  The termination letter to NEH grantees asserts that Executive Order 14217 \n“mandates that the NEH eliminate all non-statutorily required activities and functions.” But NEH \nis not one of the agencies named in the Executive Order for eliminating non-statutorily required \nactivities and functions. \n95.  The termination notices included no reference to any method for appeal or to seek \nreconsideration, even though NEH’s General Terms and Conditions require that grantees have \nthe right to appeal a termination. \n96.  According to former or current NEH staff, instead of having the opportunity to \nweigh-in on termination decisions, relevant staff learned of the grant terminations at the same \ntime that grant recipients received notifications. \nPAGE 23 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 24 of 41\n \n97.  Indeed, according to former or current NEH staff, the terminations were not \nprocessed in NEH’s eGMS system. \n98.  All of the Federation and its members’ open grants were terminated as part of the \nmass grant termination. \n99.  NEH’s grant terminations were and are unlawful.  NEH has failed to show—let \nalone provide—“good reasons for” any changes in agency policy supposedly justifying the \nterminations.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  And the \nshoddy and capricious justifications Defendants provided to justify the terminations ignore \nimportant and relevant considerations and run counter to the available evidence.  See Motor \nVehicle Mfrs Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto, Ins., Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  For these and \nother reasons, the challenged terminations violate the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2). \n100.  NEH failed entirely to provide the Federation and its members notice and \nopportunity for a hearing as required by the NEH statutes. NEH failed entirely to make a \n“finding” by the Chairperson of noncompliance, as required by the statutes, prior to terminating \ngrants.  20 U.S.C. § 956 (f)(7). \n101.  On April 3, 2025, 145 NEH staff members—making up 80% of the staff—were \nreportedly placed on administrative leave.  According to accounts of former or current NEH \nemployees, this included every staff member in the Fed/State Office except for one. \n102.  According to accounts of former or current NEH employees, as a result of the \ntermination of staff and grants, the NEH has effectively eliminated or nearly eliminated entire \ndivisions and programs, including by terminating all but one person in the Fed/State Office.  The \ndirector of the Fed/State Office, who was not originally terminated or placed on administrative \nleave on April 3, 2025, was subsequently terminated; her last day at NEH was June 6, 2025. \n103.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, NEH is no longer able to effectuate its \nstatutorily required duties.  It has terminated nearly all of its current grants and most of its future \nprograms, despite having nearly $400 million in funding for programs over the last two years, \nPAGE 24 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 25 of 41\n \nincluding $192 million it received for grant programs in March 2025, $65 million of which was \nmandated for the Federal/State Partnership. \n104.  NEH has terminated nearly all the staff necessary to undertake the review and \nprocessing of state and jurisdictional council grant applications. NEH has eliminated most of the \nstaff required to oversee any grants it does award. \nVII.  Late April “Guidance” from NEH Emphasizes APA and Constitutional Violations \nby Providing No Notice, No Hearing, No Process as Stated in the Statutes, and No \nOpportunity to Cure. \n105.  On April 24, 2025, NEH issued a press release titled “An Update on Funding \nPriorities and the Agency’s Recent Implementation of Trump Administration Executive Orders.” \nThe statement began, “[i]n recent weeks [NEH] has taken several internal operational steps to \nimprove efficiency, eliminate offices that are not essential to fulfilling its statutory requirements, \nand to return to being a responsible steward of taxpayer funds.”  In answer to the question, “Why \nis NEH cancelling awards,” the agency stated, “[a]ll federal grantmaking agencies, including \nNEH, must ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and are consistent with each \nagency’s mission. This requires that NEH regularly evaluate its funding priorities within the \npolicy framework established by Congress, the Administration, and the head of NEH. Awards \n17\nand programming must align with these priorities.”  \n106.  It is false that the Fed/State Office was “not essential to fulfilling [NEH’s] \nstatutory requirements.” As discussed above, the state and jurisdictional humanities councils are \ncreatures of statute and are provided mandatory funding per the NEH statutes.  \n107.  The agency provided no explanation or information on how it determined that \neach and every approved general operating support grant, money for which was appropriated and \nmandated by Congress, was somehow inconsistent with the agency’s mission or funding \n \n \n17\n An Update on NEH Funding Priorities and the Agency’s Recent Implementation of Trump \nAdministration Executive Orders, https://www.neh.gov/news/update-neh-funding-priorities-and-\nagencys-recent-implementation-trump-administration-executive (last visited June 10, 2025).  \nPAGE 25 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 26 of 41\n \npriorities.  On information and belief, no such analysis took place prior to the blanket termination \nof NEH grants that were part of the Federal/State Partnership.  On information and belief, the \nonly factor that went into determining whether a grant should be terminated was whether it was \nopened during the Biden Administration. \n108.  On April 30, 2025, NEH grant recipients including the Federation, Oregon \nHumanities, and the Federation’s members, received emails from the NEH Office of Grant \nManagement.  The email stated that NEH terminated awards in 2025 and attached “Guidance for \nRecipients of Terminated NEH Awards.”  The guidance provided a process for councils to submit \nfor “termination costs” associated with terminated grants, defined as “those [costs] incurred as a \ndirect result of termination and must be necessary and reasonable to ensure an orderly shut-down \nof award activities” as well as “closeout costs,” administrative costs associated with the closeout \nof a terminated award. \n109.  The April 30th guidance required Plaintiffs to submit complicated and atypical \nvouchers outside the typical NEH process.  It explicitly limited request for reimbursement of \nthese costs to a single form.  (“NEH will not permit subsequent submissions”).   \n110.  Notably, the guidance stated that all grant terminations were permanent and that \nthere would be no appeal process for the agency action.  The “Appeals” section of the guidance \nstates, in its entirety: \n \n \n \nVIII.  June 2025 “Rescission” Notices  \n111.  On June 2, 2025, the then-director of Fed/State, Karen Kenton, sent an email to \nthe Federation and its members titled “FY25 GOS Awards: terminations have been rescinded up \nto 20 percent.”  The email stated:  “I write with an important message: NEH has rescinded the \ntermination of the fiscal year 2025 General Operating Support (GOS) grants. For fiscal year \n2025, the agency is funding the humanities councils at 20 percent of its appropriation of program \nPAGE 26 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 27 of 41\n \nfunds, which is the minimum that NEH is congressionally mandated to award to our state and \njurisdictional humanities council partners [20 U.S. Code § 960 - Authorization of appropriations, \n1 B]. Starting today and over the next few days, please check eGMS for official notification.” \n112.  The Fed/State Director’s email stated, “I realize the reduction in funds from 40 \npercent to 20 percent still represents an incredible hardship.” (emphasis added)  \n113.  Shortly thereafter, the agency began delivering letters to some, but not all, of the \nstate and jurisdictional humanities councils that purported to partially, but not totally, “rescind” \nthe termination letters described in the above sections.  The letters did not effectively rescind the \ntermination notices because the letters purported to halve the funding directed to Fed/State by \nCongress and which had been previously approved by NEH.   The letters ignored a broad swath \nof grants that remain terminated.  \n114.  Upon information and belief, the “rescission” letters were identical other than the \nreference to individual Federal Award ID Numbers and the name of the relevant council.  Upon \ninformation and belief, all of the “rescission” letters addressed general operating grant support \nfor the state and jurisdictional humanities councils.   \n115.  The rescission letters did not in fact rescind grant terminations because the letters \nstated that “For fiscal year 2025, the agency is funding at a 20 percent allocation, which is the \nminimum that NEH is congressionally mandated to award to its state and jurisdictional \nhumanities council partners. … NEH will issue a partial award to bring your council’s fiscal year \n2025 GOS grant allocation to the full 20 percent minimum.”  In fact, through these letters, NEH \nreaffirmed its termination of half of its funding to the councils for Fiscal Year 2025 general \noperating support grants.  \n116.  Upon information and belief, NEH did not even partially “rescind” any of its \nblanket terminations other than Fiscal Year 2025 standard operating grants.  All other impacted \ngrants─for example supplements, cooperative agreements, special opportunity grants, and \nDialogue on the Experience of War grants─remain terminated or are stuck in process at NEH. \nPAGE 27 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 28 of 41\n \n117.  Congress mandated funding to the state and jurisdictional humanities councils of \n$65 million in the March 2025 CR and of $65 million in the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations bill. \n118.  Congress instructed that 40% of the total programmatic appropriations to NEH \nwere to be used for the federal state partnership in the 2024 Appropriations Bill.  \nIX.  Plaintiffs are Injured by NEH’s Decisions \n119.  The Trump Administration’s wholesale dismantling of NEH, near elimination of \nthe Fed/State Office, termination of nearly all previously approved general operating support \ngrants, termination of nearly all competitive and special initiative grants, and cancellation of \nnumerous programs moving forward has caused and continues to cause Plaintiffs serious, \nirreparable harm. \n120.  Before the terminations, the Federation and its members had multiple active NEH \nawards that provided stability for the operation of the councils.  The Federation and its members \nalso planned to apply, and some did apply, for new standard operating grants or for competitive \ngrants.  Many grant applications are “stuck” in process at NEH, which upon information and \nbelief is no longer processing standard operating grants because it lacks the staff to do so.   \n121.  For example, a $30,000 grant directly to the Federation to support capacity \nbuilding for councils’ data and evaluation needs, including support for an in-person consultation \nwith data and evaluation experts, was approved and then cancelled.  Prior to the DOGE \ninterference, the Federation was invited to apply for a much larger $500,000 Cooperative \nAgreement grant with NEH’s Office of Data & Evaluation for a three-year, multi-phased project \nto support the Federation’s hiring of consultants to train councils in data gathering and evaluation \nmethodology, as well as to support a new online platform to support councils.  The Cooperative \nAgreement and budget were drafted in conjunction with NEH staff before DOGE arrived at \nNEH. \n122.  The Federation has also been damaged by the councils’ inability to pay Federation \ndues because of funding cuts.  Overall, the Federation has lost approximately 27% of its \nmember-approved 2025 budget. \nPAGE 28 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 29 of 41\n \n123.  The loss of NEH support has prevented the Federation and its members from \naccomplishing their missions, including by engaging in their own grantmaking.  The \nFederation’s members use NEH funds to deliver humanities programming and provide grants to \nlocal humanities organizations in every county in the Nation, including for schools, libraries, \narchives, community history groups, students, and more.  The loss of NEH grant funding has a \ndirect adverse impact on the Federation and its members because they can no longer support \nhumanities projects across the Nation.  Small community groups receiving “microgrants” from \nthe state councils often have no other source of funds.  The councils have revoked promised \nsupport to countless local humanities organizations, damaging relationships and depriving \ncommunities of humanities content.    \n124.  Each and every member of the Federation has been impacted by grant \nterminations, delays in grant processing, uncertainty regarding the process for challenging grant \nterminations and recovery of costs, and impacts to local community humanities organizations.  \nSeveral of the Federation’s members are facing the risk of imminent shut down. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCount 1 \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1): Unlawful Withholding and/or \nUnreasonable Delay of Agency Action \n125.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n126.  The APA authorizes a court to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed.”  5 U.S.C. §706(1).  Relief is warranted under this provision where an \nagency completely fails to take, or unreasonably delays in taking, “a discrete agency action that \nit is required to take.”  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004) (emphasis \nomitted). \n127.  By statute and regulation, “discrete agency action[s]” that NEH is required to take \ninclude: making a finding and providing notice and opportunity to be heard prior to impacting \nPAGE 29 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 30 of 41\n \ngrant funding; calculation and distribution of funds appropriated by Congress using mandatory \nstatutory formulas; reasoned review and approval of grant applications; and processing of \nreimbursement requests.  The APA provides that, “within a reasonable time, each agency shall \nproceed to conclude a matter presented to it.”  5 U.S.C. §555(b) (emphasis added).   \n128.  As discussed, Defendants have actually or constructively terminated and/or \nsubstantially delayed the above-described required activities of the NEH’s grant review and \napproval processes—a significant and unprecedented departure from the NEH’s published \nreview process and the agency’s past practice. \n129.  As discussed, NEH statutes provide that once a state council’s plan has been \napproved by the Chairperson, it may be modified only in certain limited circumstances not \npresent here.  20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7) \n130.  The statutes also provide for Congressionally appropriated funds for any fiscal \nyear, “each State and each grant recipient which has a plan approved by the Chairperson shall be \nallotted at least $200,000. . . .  In any case where the sums available to carry out this subsection \nfor any fiscal year are in excess of the amount required to make the allotments under the first \nsentence of this paragraph,” certain additional amounts “shall be allotted” among the state and \njurisdictional councils. 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4) (emphasis added).  \n131.  The NEH regulations further provide that NEH will process reimbursements to \ncouncils with previously approved grants and set forth a statutory process for any grant \ntermination, which has not been followed.   \n132.  The above-described terminations, ostensible partial “rescission” of a select \nnumber of the terminations, and other delays constitute unlawful withholding and/or \nunreasonable delay of agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. §706(1) of the APA.  See, \ne.g., Rezaii v. Kennedy, No. 1:24-cv-10838, 2025 WL 750215, at *5 (D. Mass. Feb. 24, 2025) \n(holding that a plaintiff had pleaded unreasonable delay where, among other things, the agency’s \ndelay in processing plaintiff’s application was “at the outer edge of HHS’s typical time for \nprocessing”); Raouf v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 702 F. Supp. 3d 19, 33 (D. N.H. 2023) (finding that a \nPAGE 30 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 31 of 41\n \nplaintiff had pleaded unreasonable delay where she alleged that the “delay [was] attributable \nto… an ultra vires internal policy for intentionally delaying issuance of visas”). \n133.  The above-described terminations and delays have caused, are causing, and \nimminently threaten to cause direct, concrete, and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs.  As discussed \nabove, the harms from these cancellations and delays of grants have included council layoffs, \ncancellation of programming, inability to meet financial obligations including promised grants to \nlocal community groups, and difficulty making rent payments. \n134.  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order, and to a preliminary \nand permanent injunction, vacating the April 2 terminations in their entirety and compelling \nDefendants to undertake the activities of NEH’s Fed/State Office and any NEH Office required \nto act on Fed/State issues, including, but not limited to, the National Council on the Humanities, \nthat Defendants have unlawfully withheld and/or unreasonably delayed.  Such activities include \napplying the mandatory statutory formulas to Congressionally appropriated funds to determine \ndistributions among the state and jurisdictional councils; providing guidance to the state and \njurisdictional humanities councils regarding grant applications and procedures; providing an \nappeal mechanism for grant terminations or rejections; and processing distributions in \naccordance with Congressional intent.  \nCount 2 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2): Agency Action Contrary to Law \n(Grant Terminations and Partial Rescission of Terminations for Fiscal Year 2025 Grants) \n135.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n136.  The APA authorizes a court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law” and/or “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2). \nPAGE 31 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 32 of 41\n \n137.  As discussed, Defendants have invoked 2 CFR § 200.340 in canceling the grants.  \nHowever, that regulation does not apply here and does not authorize the cancellation of the \ngrants because there has been no failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the awards \nor consent by the Federation’s members.    \n138.  Defendant McDonald has not made findings required by the NEH statutes to \nterminate grants, has not provided notice and an opportunity to be heard, and has not sought \napproval of the Council for grant terminations.    \n139.  The statutes that govern the administration of grants by the NEH set out specific \nconditions and procedures for terminating and suspending grants.  Defendants have not followed \nthe procedures set out in those governing statutes and have frozen payment on grants in \ncircumstances in which the statutes would not allow those grants to be terminated or suspended. \nBy doing so, Defendants are acting contrary to law.  \n140.  The partial “rescission” letters NEH sent concerning Fiscal Year 2025 general \noperating support grants are also contrary to law.  NEH does not have discretion to alter \npreviously-approved state plans and issue Notices of Action at a “twenty percent” funding level.  \nCongress directs the amount of appropriations to the Federal/State Partnership.  The NEH \nenacting statutes provide mandatory formulas for calculating distributions to the councils based \nupon the appropriations.  The NEH previously approved funding at a certain level when it issued \nNotices of Action pursuant to the councils’ approved plans.  NEH must apply the statutory \nformulas and follow Congress’s direction that the Federal/State partnership should be allocated \nthe relevant federal state partnership appropriations for each fiscal year. NEH acted contrary to \nlaw by terminating the grants in the first instance without a statutory finding by the Director or \nnotice and an opportunity for a hearing for the councils.  It cannot cure that unlawful action by a \npartial rescission of the same.   \n141.  DOGE, an agent of the Executive Branch, does not have authority to terminate \nmandatory funding from Congress.  Its actions are ultra vires and an unconstitutional violation of \nSeparation of Powers and are unlawful for that reason, as well.  \nPAGE 32 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 33 of 41\n \n142.  In addition or in the alternative, on information and belief, Defendant Director \nMcDonald has acted contrary to law by taking action against the councils without making the \nrequisite statutory findings, without providing notice and an opportunity for hearing, by \nwithholding purportedly necessary approvals to the NEH to release funding appropriated by \nCongress, and by failing to convene the Council. \n143.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order and judgment, and a preliminary \nand permanent injunction, holding unlawful and vacating Defendants’ termination and partial \nrescission of the Federal/State Partnership grants and the staff directives to and within NEH \nunderlying the terminations.   \nCount 3 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2): Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n144.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n145.  The APA requires a court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. §706 (2)(A). \n146.  An agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has “relied on factors \nwhich Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of \nthe problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \nagency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of \nagency expertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 U.S. at 43.  An agency action is also arbitrary \nand capricious if, when departing from a prior policy, an agency does not “display awareness \nthat it is changing position” or does not “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.”  \nFox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515. \n147.  As described above, Defendants have terminated the Plaintiffs’ grants on the \nground that each “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities.”  Defendants have \nPAGE 33 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 34 of 41\n \ncommunicated these termination decisions through boilerplate letters, using stock language for a \nlarge swath of varied grants. \n148.  Defendants sent a form communication in June 2025 suggesting NEH would \nrescind the prior mass terminations.  However, the communication stated NEH would halve the \nsupport to councils under the Fiscal Year 2025 general operating grants from 40% to 20% levels, \nwhich it noted “still represents an incredible hardship.”  The statute cited in support of the June \n2025 “Rescission” letters is a vestige from the early 1990s that has not been applied by the \nagency and which is directly contradicted by NEH’s authorizing statutes and Congressional \ninstruction.  Thus, the June 2025 “Rescission” letters are also arbitrary and capricious and not in \naccordance with law.   \n149.  Defendants’ decisions are arbitrary and capricious because their boilerplate letters \ndo not acknowledge—let alone provide “good reasons for”—any official change in agency \npolicy including a diminution in available funding.  Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515.  \nIndeed, this boilerplate language obfuscates the obvious, actual reason for the terminations: \nimplementation of the President’s EOs and other policies.  While the White House and DOGE \ninitially asked NEH to comb through its open grants to determine whether each grant ran afoul of \nthe EOs, and to rate each grant’s “risk level,” DOGE ultimately mass terminated NEH grants \nwithout any such analysis (which would also have been arbitrary and capricious under the law) \nand instead determined that any grants opened under the Biden Administration were subject to \ntermination.  Such a patently false explanation does not satisfy the requirement to provide a \nreasoned basis for agency decision making. \n150.  Defendants’ funding freeze decisions also fail to account for the substantial \nreliance interests in the ordinary disbursement of funds authorized by the NEH that the freeze \nradically disrupts. “When an agency changes course . . . it must be cognizant that longstanding \npolicies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account,’’ and the \nfailure to do so is arbitrary and capricious.  DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 \n(2020) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nPAGE 34 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 35 of 41\n \n151.   Defendants’ termination decisions are arbitrary and capricious for the additional \nreason that they have not engaged in reasoned consideration of any individual project before \nterminating a grant. \n152.  Defendants’ termination decisions are arbitrary and capricious for the additional \nreason that, in purporting to terminate the Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ members’ grants, Defendants \nfailed to consider several important aspects of the issues before them, including, at a minimum \n(1) Plaintiffs’ reliance interests in the terminated projects; (2) whether those projects could be \nadjusted, rather than terminated, to comply with Defendants’ new “priorities” (assuming those \nnew “priorities” were otherwise lawful); (3) whether Defendants could have adopted a measure \nother than across-the-board termination of entire categories of grants to effectuate their new \n“priorities” (assuming those new “priorities” were otherwise lawful); and (4) the harm that \nterminating the grants would inflict on U.S. citizens benefiting from the authorized grant activity. \n153.  Defendants’ partial rescission of the terminations in June 2025 are equally \narbitrary and capricious. The agency engaged in no analysis of which open grants were subject to \nfunding at an alleged 20% level; provided no explanation for its decision to “reinstate” some, but \nnot all grants; and failed to tether the “reinstatement” to the statutes. \n154.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order and judgment, and a preliminary \nand permanent injunction, holding unlawful and setting aside Defendants’ termination of the \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ members’ grants and the staff directives to and within NEH underlying \nthe terminations.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to an order and judgment that NEH’s \npronouncement that Fed/State was “not essential to fulfilling [NEH’s] statutory requirements” \nwas arbitrary and capricious and requiring the rehiring of staff to fulfill the critical work of \nFed/State at NEH, including the grant application, processing, approval, and other work \nnecessary within eGMS to fund the state and jurisdictional humanities councils as required by \nstatute. \n \n \nPAGE 35 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 36 of 41\n \nCount 4 \nSeparation of Powers; Appropriations Clause; Spending Clause; Take Care Clause \n155.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n156.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 326–27 (2015). \n157.  The Constitution “grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.”  \nCity & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018); see U.S. Const. \nart. I, §9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, §8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause).  “Among \nCongress’s most important authorities is its control of the purse.”  Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. \n477, 505 (2023).  “The Appropriations Clause is thus a bulwark of the Constitution’s separation \nof powers among the three branches of the National Government.”  U.S. Dep’t of Navy v. Fed. \nLab. Rels. Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, J.).  If not for the \nAppropriations Clause, “the executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse \nof the nation.”  Id. (internal citations omitted). \n158.  Congress also possesses exclusive power to legislate.  Article I, Section 1 of the \nConstitution states that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of \nthe United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.”  U.S. Const. \nart. I, §1; see Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (“There is no provision in \nthe Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”) \n159.  The Constitution further provides that the Executive must “take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3; see Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 \nU.S. 302, 327 (2014) (“Under our system of government, Congress makes the laws and the \nPresident . . . faithfully executes them.” (brackets and quotation marks omitted)). \n160.  The Executive Branch violates the Take Care Clause where it declines to execute \nor otherwise undermines statutes enacted by Congress and signed into law or duly promulgated \nPAGE 36 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 37 of 41\n \nregulations implementing such statutes.  See In re United Mine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 \nF.3d 545, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[T]he President is without authority to set aside congressional \nlegislation by executive order . . . .”);  Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838) \n(rejecting argument that by charging the President with faithful execution of the laws, the Take \nCare Clause “implies a power to forbid their execution”); see also Util. Air. Reg. Grp., 573 U.S. \nat 327 (noting that the President “act[s] at time through agencies”). \n161.  Nor does any statute authorize the Executive’s action here.  Congress consistently \nhas appropriated funds to NEH to further its statutory purposes of advancing the humanities \nnationwide and has not authorized the Executive to decline to spend vast swaths of funds. \nFurther, Congress has provided for a procedure by which the Executive may propose to Congress \nto either rescind or cancel funds.  Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, \n2 U.S.C. §§ 682 et seq.  That statute likewise does not permit the Executive to take unilateral \naction, instead requiring the President must “propose[]” any rescission to Congress (which \nCongress must then affirmatively approve) and may not defer funding for the policy reasons \nDefendants explicitly invoke here. 2 U.S.C. §§ 683, 684(a).    \n162.  Accordingly, consistent with these principles, the Executive’s authority is at its \n“lowest ebb” because he is acting without constitutional authority and contrary to the will of \nCongress by attempting to unilaterally decline to spend appropriated funds.  See Youngstown \nSheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637–38 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n163.  Defendants’ systematic delays and terminations—as reflected in their treatment of \nthe Plaintiffs’ grants—therefore violates the separation-of-powers constraints described above, \nincluding by failing to take care to execute legislation, enacted by Congress and signed into law \nby the President, as required by Article II, section 3, of the Constitution.  Through these actions, \nDefendants have overridden the careful judgments of Congress by refusing to disburse duly \nappropriated funding.   \n164.  The delays and terminations are also contrary to the principle that funding \nrestrictions can only impose conditions that are reasonably related to the federal interest in the \nPAGE 37 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 38 of 41\n \nproject and the project’s objectives.  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207–08 (1987).  Here, the \ndelays and terminations are not related to the federal interest in the humanities—to support and \nencourage promotion of scholarship in the humanities—and instead are related to policies and \npolitical factors.  \n165.  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to a vacatur, and a preliminary \nand permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from injuring the Fed/State office—as reflected \nin their treatment of the delayed grant applications, delayed reimbursements and approvals, and \nterminated grants.  For the same reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2201, to a \ndeclaration that Defendants’ systematic delays and terminations—as reflected in their treatment \nof the delayed grant processing and terminated grants—violates the Constitution’s guarantee of \nseparation of powers and the Executive Branch’s obligation to Take Care to execute legislation \nduly enacted by Congress and signed into law by the President. \nCount 5 \nImplied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions, Actions by DOGE \nwithout Legal Authority (Against Defendants DOGE and Gleason) \n166.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n167.  Federal agencies “possess only the authority that Congress has provided.”  Nat’l \nFed. of Indep. Bus. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). “[A]n agency literally has no power to \nact . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”  La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 \nU.S. 355, 374 (1986). \n168.  Congress did not create DOGE and has not vested DOGE with any powers. \nRather, DOGE is an agency that was created by the President via Executive Order 145.  \n169.  DOGE has not been authorized by Congress to conduct business of another \ncongressionally authorized agency such as the NEH. \nPAGE 38 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 39 of 41\n \n170.  The actions set forth above, including the dismantling of Fed/State and the \ntermination of all grants approved during the Biden Administration, were directly undertaken by, \nor specifically directed by DOGE.   \n171.  Because DOGE does not possess any congressionally conferred authority to \nterminate the NEH’s grants and contracts, or to eliminate the Fed/State Office at NEH, DOGE \nand Gleason’s actions are ultra vires and should be enjoined and declared unlawful.  \nCount 6 \nInstitutional and Grant Termination Claims: Impoundment Control Act and \nAppropriations Acts Violations–Nonstatutory Review and Ultra Vires Actions            \n(Against Defendants McDonald and Gleason)  \n172.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n173.  Plaintiffs may bring a nonstatutory claim to enjoin Defendants McDonald and \nGleason from acting ultra vires in violation of statutory commands. \n174.  Defendants’ delay in spending or outright refusal to spend money that Congress \nappropriated, elimination or near elimination of entire divisions, shutting down of entire \nprograms, and mass firing of staff are without statutory authority and violate the Impoundment \nControl Act, the 2024 Appropriations Act, and subsequent Continuing Resolutions. \n175.   Defendants’ termination of grants and partial rescissions, including the grants to \nPlaintiffs and their members, is without statutory authority and violates the Impoundment \nControl Act, the 2024 Act, and 2025 Continuing Resolutions, because the individual grant \nterminations were a primary means by which Defendants carried out their deferral of \nappropriated funds and outright refusals to spend appropriated funds. \n176.  Because Defendants’ actions violate statutory commands and are ultra vires, they \nshould be enjoined and declared unlawful. \n \n \n \nPAGE 39 –  AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 6      Filed 06/11/25      Page 40 of 41\n \nCount 7 \nAttorney Fees \n177.

Financial support from state and jurisdictional humanities councils reaches nearly \nevery corner of every state and jurisdiction of the United States, enabling our Nation to preserve \nand honor the stories, cultures, ideas, practices, and experiences of all Americans. The National \nEndowment for the Humanities (“NEH”) has funded our state and jurisdictional councils for the \npast half-century with broad, bipartisan support.  \n2.  The United States DOGE Service (“DOGE”) brought the core work of those \ncouncils to a screeching halt in March and April 2025 when DOGE gutted the NEH and \nterminated almost all grants issued to the state and jurisdictional councils by the prior \nAdministration with no reasoned analysis and with total disregard for the Congressionally \nmandated role of councils: to ensure that humanities programs reach every part of the United \nStates. \n3.  We ask the Court to stop this imminent threat to our Nation’s historic and critical \nsupport of the humanities by restoring funding appropriated by Congress.  This lawsuit \nchallenges the disruption and attempted destruction, spearheaded by DOGE, of the \ncongressionally established federal-state partnership between the NEH and the fifty-six state and \njurisdictional humanities councils created under federal statutes and funded by Congress. \nThe Background \n4.  In 1965, Congress declared that “[t]he arts and the humanities belong to all the \npeople of the United States” and accordingly established the NEH.  20 U.S.C. § 953(a); § 956. \n5.  According to its mission statement, “[b]ecause democracy demands wisdom, the \nNEH serves and strengthens our republic by promoting excellence in the humanities and \n1\nconveying the lessons of history to all Americans.”  \n \n \n1\n About the National Endowment for the Humanities, https://www.neh.gov/about (last visited \nMay 14, 2025).     \nPAGE 2 – COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 3 of 34\n6.  Consistent with its mission, and with historically bipartisan support from \nCongress and administrations of both political parties, the NEH has funded humanities programs \nthroughout the country since 1965. \n7.  In 1972, Congress amended the NEH statutes to provide for the creation of a \ngrants-in-aid programs in each of the states and territories of the United States. From 1972 \nforward, the NEH has funded state and jurisdictional humanities councils through congressional \nappropriations to the federal agency.   \n8.  The NEH statutes provide that states and jurisdictions of the United States shall \nreceive NEH funding by establishing grant recipient organizations with board members \nappointed by an officer or agency of such state. See 20 U.S.C. § 956(2)(B).  Each of the states \nand territories whose humanities councils are involved in this litigation have formed Section \n501(c)(3) nonprofit state humanities councils, most of which are members of Plaintiff Federation \nof State Humanities Councils (“Federation”). \n9.  For example, in 1971, Oregon created the Oregon Council for the Humanities, \ndoing business as Oregon Humanities (“Oregon Humanities) as a Section 501(c)(3) to distribute \nNEH funds to public humanities projects in communities all over Oregon.  The Governor of \nOregon appoints up to 25% of the members to Oregon Humanities’ board of directors. As such, \nOregon Humanities is funded by the NEH under 20 U.S.C. § 956(2)(B). Each of the other states \nand jurisdictions of the United States also has a 501(c)(3) humanities council and all but two \nhumanities councils are members of the Federation. \nNEH Funding Preserves the History of our Cultures. \n10.  “[T]he humanities explore, interpret, and preserve the diversity of human cultures, \nideas, practices and experiences, past and present. They are the languages, religions, laws, \nPAGE 3 – COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 4 of 34\nphilosophies, and customs that make us distinct. They are our history and our cultures, the ideas \n2\nand movements that have shaped societies throughout time.”    \n11.  From Mississippi to South Dakota, Maine to California, the Northern Mariana \nIslands to Idaho, and places in between, NEH funding flows to state and jurisdictional \nhumanities councils who in turn support a multitude of local grass roots public humanities \nprograms throughout the Nation.  According to NEH, “[s]tate and jurisdictional humanities \n3\ncouncils are the public humanities in action.”     \n12.  Indeed, here in Oregon, NEH funding helps fund humanities programming in \nevery corner of the state—grants for rural libraries in communities such as Burns, Joseph, Blue \nRiver, Newport, and Forest Grove; funding for youth-led conversations about mental health in \nMedford; funding for storytelling projects led by Nez Perce Wallowa Homeland; the publication \nof a widely-distributed Oregon Humanities magazine featuring stories from all over the state; \nand so much more.  \n13.  NEH funding is critical to the survival of state and jurisdictional humanities \ncouncils.  By statute, NEH funds a large portion of the cost of activities that meet the NEH \nstatutory criteria for each state and jurisdictional council. 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(1).   \n14.  NEH manages its relationships with the Federation and the member state and \njurisdictional humanities councils through its Office of Federal/State Partnership (“Fed/State”).  \nFed/State acts as the liaison between the NEH and the nonprofit network of state and \njurisdictional humanities councils, including the Federation. \nNEH Funding to the States & Jurisdictions is Mandatory   \n15.  NEH funding for state and jurisdictional councils is mandatory. See, e.g., 20 \n \n \n2\n About the National Endowment for the Humanities, https://www.neh.gov/about (last visited \nMay 14, 2025).     \n3\n Federal-State Partnership One Page Description, https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-\nfiles/Federal-State%20Partnership_one-page%20description_2020.pdf (last visited May 14, \n2025).   \nPAGE 4 – COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 5 of 34\nU.S.C. § 956(4).  Even NEH’s website describes it as such: “[b]y congressional mandate, \n[NEH] provides general operating support awards to support public humanities programming in \nthe 56 states and jurisdictions. Fed/State works with the designated humanities councils in each \n4\nstate and jurisdiction. The councils are Fed/State’s sole awardees.”   \n16.  Fed/State provides such general operating support awards and other grant funding \nto the Federation’s members “in order to bring humanities education, lifelong learning, and \npublic humanities programming to communities across the country. Fed/State collaborates with \n[the Federation’s members] to advance public understanding of the humanities, while enhancing \n5\npublic awareness of, access to, and support for the humanities on a local, grassroots level.”   \n17.  Each fiscal year, Congress appropriates funds for the NEH to carry out its \nstatutory functions, including awarding grants. Appropriations to state and jurisdictional councils \nare delineated in each fiscal year appropriation bill.   \n18.  In Fiscal Year 2024, for example, Congress appropriated $207 million to NEH, of \n6\nwhich $65 million was directed to the councils.   The statutes provide formulas for allocating the \nFed/State grant funding among the state and jurisdictional councils.  For one example, 44% “of \n[certain fiscal year appropriations] shall be allotted in equal amounts among the States and grant \nrecipients which have plans approved by the Chairperson [of NEH]” and 22% “of [certain fiscal \nyear appropriations] shall be allotted [in consistent with population to] the States and grant \nrecipients which have plans approved by the Chairperson [of NEH].”  20 U.S.C. § \n956(f)(4)(B)&(C).  \n \n \n4\n National Endowment for the Humanities: Office of Federal/State Partnership, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/divisions/fedstate (last visited May 14, 2025) (emphasis added).  \n5\n Id.  \n6\n National Endowment for the Humanities: FY 2024 Appropriations, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2024-\n08/FY%202024%20Appropriations%20Breakdown%20New%20Logo%20small.pdf (last visited \nMay 14, 2025).  \nPAGE 5 – COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 6 of 34\nNEH Funding is in Imminent Jeopardy. \n19.  The critical work of the NEH and its congressionally mandated financial support \nof state and jurisdictional humanities councils is now in jeopardy. Since the first week of April \n2025, the current Administration and its United States DOGE Service have engaged in a \nconcerted effort to disrupt and destroy the work of the NEH and the Fed/State Office. These \nefforts are unlawful, and Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to seek relief for the immediate harms these \nefforts are causing to the Federation, its members, and those members’ many grant recipients.  \n20.  Defendants’ destructive efforts have taken the form of eliminating all but one staff \nperson from the Fed/State office; across-the-board delays in the review and approval of \notherwise approved grant reimbursements; delays and changes in pending grant applications; \nwidespread terminations of already-issued grants without notice or appeal opportunities; and \narbitrary and capricious changes to grant application processes and procedures.  Plaintiffs \nchallenge all of these unconstitutional disruptions under the Administrative Procedures Act \n(APA). \n21.  Defendants’ actions also contravene the separation-of-powers constraints on the \nExecutive Branch—and so also violate the Constitution. The Constitution grants Congress—not \nthe President—the power to create and prescribe the duties of federal agencies, and Congress \nmaintains the exclusive power of the purse in directing how federal funds must be spent.  The \nNEH may not refuse to spend funds that Congress has appropriated for state and jurisdictional \nhumanities councils.  \n22.  The challenged delays and grant terminations have caused—and, if left \nunchecked, will continue to cause—direct, immediate, significant, and irreparable harm to the \nFederation and its members.   \n23.  The Federation and its members are collectively awaiting NEH’s decisions on \nhundreds of thousands of dollars of requested humanities grants, including funds already \nappropriated by Congress.  And now, the NEH has ostensibly terminated general operating and \nsupport grants already issued to the Federation’s members, clawing back millions of dollars (and \nPAGE 6 – COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 7 of 34\ncounting) in already-awarded money.  The result of these disruptions has been devastating to the \nFederation’s members.   \n24.  State and jurisdictional humanities councils have terminated staff, cancelled \nplanned events with community groups, ended support for libraries, schools, and families, \nterminated reading and writing programming, history programs, and more.  Several state and \njurisdictional humanities councils are at risk of closing permanently.  \n25.  The Federation itself will be damaged by loss of member dues and risks closing \ndue to lack of funding.    \n26.  For all these reasons, Plaintiffs seek relief from this Court.  The Court should \norder the NEH to: undertake the grant-application review process as the law requires; continue \nfunding the Federation’s members with the funds appropriated by Congress; apply the statutory \ncriteria when making grant determinations; process advance and reimbursement applications for \nfunding in normal course; and provide notice and an opportunity to cure and/or to challenge \nNEH decisions as required by law. The Court should set aside the NEH’s unlawful termination \nof the Federation and its members’ already-issued grants. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate these claims because this \naction arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, 28 U.S.C. § 1331; because \nDefendants are United States officials, 28 U.S.C. § 1356(a)(2); and because this case arises under \nthe judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. \n28.  This Court may grant declaratory, injunctive, and other relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706, and the Court’s inherent authority to enjoin federal \nofficials from acting unlawfully. \n29.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  Defendants are \nfederal agencies and officers sued in their official capacity.  Plaintiff Oregon Council of \nHumanities (“Oregon Humanities”), also a member of Plaintiff Federation of State Humanities \nCouncils, is a resident of this judicial district. \nPAGE 7 – COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 8 of 34\nPARTIES \n30.  Plaintiff Oregon Humanities is a nonprofit corporation created in 1971 to \ndistribute NEH funds to public humanities projects in communities all over Oregon.  The NEH is \nOregon Humanities’ largest funder and oldest partner.  Oregon Humanities is also a member of \nthe Federation. \n31.  Founded in 1977, Plaintiff Federation of State Humanities Councils is a nonprofit \norganization whose members include all but two of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities \n7\ncouncils.   Through advocacy, events, partnerships, and shared resources, the Federation unites \nthe work and voices of our Nation’s humanities councils.  Its mission is to advocate for increased \ninvestment in and engagement with the national network of humanities councils and to support, \nconnect, and amplify the work and voices of its members, demonstrating the councils’ value for \ncommunities and their collective impact on civic health and cultural vibrancy.  Both the \nFederation and its members receive grant funding directly from the NEH.  As described in more \ndetail below, the Federation and its members have been substantially injured by the recent \nactions of, or in the name of, NEH.   \n32.  Defendant United States DOGE Service (“DOGE”) is a component of the \nExecutive Office of the President established by Executive Order 14158 on January 20, 2025.  \n33.  Defendant Amy Gleason is the Acting Administrator of the United States DOGE \nService and is the DOGE’s highest ranking official. As such, she is responsible for activities of \nthe organization. She is sued in her official capacity only. \n34.  Defendant National Endowment for the Humanities is an agency of the United \nStates government.  The National Council on the Humanities is an advisory council “established \nin the National Endowment for the Humanities” pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 957. \n \n \n7\n National Endowment for the Humanities: Directory of State Humanities Councils,   \nhttps://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-\nfiles/Directory%20of%20State%20Humanities%20Councils%202021%20%283%29.pdf (last \nvisited May 14, 2025). \nPAGE 8 – COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 9 of 34\n35.  Defendant Michael McDonald is the Acting Chairman of the National \nEndowment for the Humanities.  Defendant McDonald is a member of the National Council on \nthe Humanities.  He is sued in his official capacity only. \nFACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND \n“Democracy demands wisdom.” \nI.  Congress Establishes NEH \n36.  Finding that “[t]he arts and the humanities belong to all people of the United \nStates,” 20 U.S.C. § 951(1), Congress created the NEH and its sister agency, the National \nEndowment for the Arts (“NEA”), in 1965, as part of the National Foundation on the Arts and \nHumanities Act of 1965 (“NFAHA” or “the Act”). Pub. L. 89-209, 79 Stat. 845 (Sept. 29, 1965) \n(codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 951-60). \n37.  In establishing the NEH, Congress found that “it is necessary and appropriate for \nthe Federal Government to complement, assist, and add to programs for the advancement of the \nhumanities and the arts by local, State, regional, and private agencies and their organizations.” \nId. § 951(5). Congress believed that the federal government has a key role in “help[ing] create \nand sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry but also \nthe material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent.” Id. § 951(7). \n38.  Accordingly, Congress established the NEH to provide funding for organizations \nand individuals involved in research, publication of scholarly works, and promotion of the \nhumanities. See 20 U.S.C. § 956. \n39.  Congress viewed this directive as a broad one, meant to fund a wide range of \nprojects and not to promote a singular viewpoint, and to fund traditionally underrepresented \nrecipients. See 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). \n40.  To that end, in creating NEH, Congress included several provisions aimed at \nprotecting the agency from political influence. For example, Congress has prohibited federal \nagencies and employees from “exercis[ing] any direction, supervision, or control over the policy \ndetermination, personnel, or curriculum” of any grantee organization.  20 U.S.C. § 953(c). \nPAGE 9 – COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 10 of 34\n41.  This statutory framework demonstrates Congress’s intent to insulate NEH from \npolitical control. As a Senate committee report explained: “It is the intent of the committee that \nin the administration of this act there be given the fullest attention to freedom of artistic and  \nhumanistic expression. . . . [N]o undue preference should be given to any particular style or \nschool of thought or expression.” S. Rep. No. 80-300, at 3–4 (1965). \n42.  With this broad purpose in mind, Congress provided that the Chairperson of the \nNEH may “enter into arrangements,” including “contracts, grants, loans, and other forms of \nassistance,” to further a limited set of purposes.  20 U.S.C. § 956(c).  These purposes include to: \n  develop and encourage the pursuit of a national policy for the promotion \nof progress and scholarship in the humanities; \n  initiate and support research and programs to strengthen the research and \nteaching potential of the United States in the humanities by making \narrangements with individuals or groups to support such activities; \n  initiate and support training and workshops in the humanities by making \narrangements with institutions or individuals; \n  initiate and support programs and research which have substantial \nscholarly and cultural significance and that reach, or reflect the diversity \nand richness of our American cultural heritage, including the culture of, a \nminority, inner city, rural, or tribal community; \n  foster international programs and exchanges; \n  foster the interchange of information in the humanities; \n  foster, with groups, education in, and public understanding and \nappreciation of the humanities; \n  support the publication of scholarly works in the humanities; \n  ensure that the benefit of its programs will also be available to our citizens \nwhere such programs would otherwise be unavailable due to geographic or \neconomic reasons; and \nPAGE 10 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 11 of 34\n  foster programs and projects that provide access to, and preserve materials \nimportant to research, education, and public understanding of, the \nhumanities. \nId. \n43.  In addition, Congress provided for three additional types of grant programs \nincluding grants in aid programs in each state, at issue here. \n44.  Through these programs, the NEH has played a significant role in both expanding \naccess to the humanities and funding a wide range of research, training, and education.  \n45.  The NEH’s chair, currently Defendant McDonald, is advised by the National \nCouncil on the Humanities, a board of twenty-six “distinguished private citizens appointed by \n8\nthe president and confirmed by the Senate”  (the “Council”).  20 U.S.C. § 957.  \n46.  One of the statutory functions of the Council is to “review applications for \nfinancial support and make recommendations thereon to the Chairperson. The Chairperson shall \nnot approve or disapprove any such application until the Chairperson has received the \nrecommendation of the Council on such application, unless the Council fails to make a \nrecommendation thereon within a reasonable time.”  Id. at § 957 (f). \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Typical Receipt of NEH Grants Funding \n“The humanities are the languages, religions, laws, philosophies, and customs that \nmake us distinct. They are our history and our cultures, the ideas and movements that have \nshaped societies throughout time.” \n47.  The Federation’s members depend heavily on NEH funding to support their \nhumanities programming. At any given time, individual state and jurisdictional humanities \ncouncils may depend on multiple NEH grants that support their operations and fund local and \ngrassroots humanities organizations in the respective United States territory, such as libraries, \nteachers, and humanities-focused community groups. \n \n \n8\n About the National Council on the Humanities, https://www.neh.gov/about/national-council-\non-the-humanities (last visited May 14, 2025).  \nPAGE 11 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 12 of 34\n48.  State and jurisdictional councils apply to NEH for standard operating grants in \nresponse to a NEH Notice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”).  The NOFO for each Fiscal Year \nCongressional appropriation outlines the steps that councils must take to request a standard \noperating grant.  Typically, the annual standard operating grant NOFO is posted in January or \nFebruary each year.  \n49.  Once councils submit application materials to the NEH, they await award \ndecisions, which are announced via a system called eGMS. eGMS Reach is the system for \napplication review, award management, and official communications at NEH.  Award decisions, \ncalled Notice of Actions, set out the amount of funds awarded to the council for the operating \ngrant.  The amount of money in the pool to make award decisions is entirely dependent upon \nCongressional appropriations. \n50.  Standard operating grants for state and jurisdictional councils are generally for a \nthree-year period with funds available for five years.  These grants provide stability to the \nFederation and its member councils, permitting the councils to pursue programs and activities in \naccordance with their respective annual plans.  \n51.  Councils receive the NEH standard operating grant funding in one of two ways. \nThey may ask for funds in advance for a particular expense. The majority of funds, however, are \nreimbursements. Councils pay expenses directly, then seek reimbursement through eGMS under \nthe relevant operating grant.  Until April 2, 2025, the NEH routinely and rapidly reimbursed \ncouncils for these expenses (generally within five to seven business days) as the outlay of money \nhad already been approved by the NEH as mandated by Congress. \n52.  To better illustrate the above system, consider Oregon Humanities. Oregon \nHumanities applied for and was approved for a standard operating grant that spans November 1, \n2022, to October 31, 2027.  An NEH Notice of Action approved $2,580,205 in funding for this \ngrant.  The grant constituted approximately 50% of Oregon Humanities’ budget each year.  To \ndate, NEH has awarded and reimbursed $2,029,271 in funds under this grant.  Oregon \nHumanities submitted an additional $292,000 in reimbursement requests for expenses through \nPAGE 12 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 13 of 34\nMarch 31, 2025, which, as discussed in more detail below, have not been processed by NEH.  An \nadditional $258,934 is available under this grant during Fiscal Year 2025. \n53.  In response to a NOFO, Oregon Humanities submitted an application for a new \noperating grant for November 1, 2025 to October 31, 2030.  That grant application has not been \nprocessed by NEH. \n54.  Each member of the Federation is in a similar position:  all have standard \noperating grants that have been awarded but not fully paid. Many have unreimbursed expenses \nheld up at NEH.  Some have requested and not received advanced funds.  All have received \ntermination notices for existing grants.  And NEH is not processing new operating grant \napplications in normal course.  \n55.  In addition to standard operating grants, councils may apply for and receive grant \nfunding by applying for special initiative funding offered by NEH or for competitive grant \nopportunities.  These funding opportunities are regularly posted on the NEH website and \nannounced through eGMS. \n56.  Special initiative grants are “non-competitive grants.”  In other words, unlike \nstandard operating grants, councils may or may not apply for funding for particular projects \nannounced by the NEH chair. If a special initiative grant is offered to the full range of councils, \nonly councils interested in that funding opportunity will apply. \n57.  For example, in 2025 Oregon Humanities applied for funding through a second \nround of NEH’s United We Stand special initiative and was awarded $40,000 in grant funds.  \nThose funds have already been expended by Oregon Humanities but not reimbursed by NEH. \nIII.  Congressional Appropriations to NEH Amount to Hundreds of Millions of Dollars \nEach Fiscal Year, Most of Which is for Grantmaking \n“The councils bring humanities education, lifelong learning, and public humanities \nprogramming to local communities throughout the country.” \n58.  Overall, from Fiscal Year 1966 to 2025, Congress generally increased NEH \nfunding annually, which is consistent with NEH’s stable, and generally increasing funding to \nPAGE 13 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 14 of 34\nstate and jurisdictional councils for nearly sixty years, under administrations of both political \n9\nparties.     \n59.  Congress’s appropriations to NEH for Fiscal Year 2024 were no different. \nConsistent with past appropriations for NEH activities, in the Further Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2024 (2024 CAA), Congress appropriated $207 million to NEH, of which \n$192 million “shall be available for support of activities in the humanities, pursuant to section \n7(c) [20 U.S.C. § 956(c)] of the Act and for administering the functions of the Act.” $65 million \nof that $192 million was further specifically directed to the Federal/State Partnership.  This \nmoney was designated for grants, operations, loans, contracts, and other assistance to further the \nenumerated purposes set forth under 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 282 (Mar. \n9, 2024) (the “2024 Act”). \n60.  Congress has not enacted a Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n2025, but on March 15, 2025, the President signed the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and \nExtensions Act2025, commonly known as a “Continuing Resolution” or “CR” (2025 CR).  Pub. \nL. 119-4, §§ 1101-08, 139 Stat. 9, 10-12.  Pursuant to the 2025 CR, Congress appropriated \n“[s]uch amounts as may be necessary . . . under the authority and conditions provided in \napplicable appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2024, for projects or activities . . . that are not \notherwise specifically provided for, and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were \nmade available” in the specific appropriations Acts. Id.., div A, § 1101(a), 139 Stat. at 11.  NEH \nthus received an additional $207 million that it must spend, including an additional $192 million \nthat it must spend on grants and other assistance programs under 20 U.S.C. § 956(c), and $65 \nmillion of that $192 million was further specifically directed to the Federal/State Partnership. \n \n \n9\n National Endowment for the Humanities: NEH Appropriations: FY 1966–2024, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2024-\n08/NEH%20Appropriations%202024%20center.pdf (last accessed May 14, 2025).  \nPAGE 14 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 15 of 34\n61.  The 2025 CR extended congressional appropriations to the NEH through \nSeptember 30, 2025.  State and jurisdictional councils should have received Notices of Action \ntied to existing operating grants following the 2025 CR.  For example, Oregon Humanities’ \nfunding should have increased by an additional $578,000 based upon this appropriation, bringing \nits total award for its operating grant to $3,140,000.  That Notice of Action was never provided. \n62.  The Federation and its members have not received Notices of Action for the \nCongressionally mandated funds from the 2025 CR.   \nIV.  Federal Statutes and Regulations Provide a Process for Grant Termination \nIncluding Notice and an Opportunity to Cure. \n63.  Federal grants such as the standard operating grants to the Federation’s members \nmay be terminated per federal statutes and regulations if certain conditions occur.  See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(f)(7); 2 C.F.R. § 200.240(a).  As a prerequisite to termination, however, the statutes \nrequire a finding by the NEH Chairperson “after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard.” \n20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(7).  Such a prerequisite finding may be that a council (1) “is not complying \nsubstantially with the provisions” of the state council subsection of the statutes, (2) “is not \ncomplying substantially with terms and conditions of its State plan or grant recipient application \napproved under” the same section, or (3) “any funds granted to [a council] have been diverted \nfrom the purposes for which they are allotted.”  Id. \n64.  The regulations further provide that grants may be terminated by the respective \nfederal agency if the recipient “fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal \naward.”  Id. at 1.  Alternately, a grant may be terminated by the agency with the consent of the \nrecipient where the two parties agree upon termination conditions.  Id. at (2).  Finally, a grant \nmay be terminated by the agency “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, \nincluding, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or \nagency priorities.”  Id. at (4).  \n65.  If an agency terminates a grant prior to the end of the grant period “due to the \nrecipient’s material failure to comply with the terms and conditions,” the agency is required to \nPAGE 15 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 16 of 34\nfollow a process including reporting the termination and other processes including providing the \ngrant recipient with opportunities to challenge the decision and appeal rights.  See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.342.   \n66.  Significantly, the regulations require an opportunity for objections and appeal.  \n(“The Federal agency must maintain written procedures for processing objections, hearings, and \nappeals. Upon initiating a remedy for noncompliance (for example . . . termination), the Federal \nagency must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information \nchallenging the action.  The Federal agency or pass-through entity must comply with any \nrequirements for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings to which the recipient or \nsubrecipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.”)  Id. \nV.  DOGE Sweeps into NEH and Mass Terminates Grants and Staff \n67.  The normal operations of NEH abruptly ended in March 2025.   \n68.  Before March, following President Trump’s election as President, NEH received a \nseries of instructions from the White House.  According to accounts of former or current NEH \nemployees, NEH staff were instructed to examine every open grant at NEH dating back to 2021 \nand determine whether each open grant ran afoul of any Executive Order (EO) issued by \nPresident Trump in his first days in office in 2025.  NEH staff were instructed to develop an \nExcel spreadsheet listing every grant and determine the level of risk that such grant ran afoul of \nEOs and to rate the risk from “low” to “serious” (the “Spreadsheet”).  NEH staff spent several \nworkdays in February and early March combing through grants to determine whether they \ninvolved DEI work, for example, rating the risk, and working on completing the Spreadsheet.  \n69.  NEH staff received little if any guidance for how to make such an assessment of \nopen grants or how to “rate” the risk that a standard operating grant (for example) implicated the \nPresident Trump EOs.  NEH staff at Fed/State examined open grants to the state and \njurisdictional humanities councils and generally rated such grants as “low” risk.   \n70.  On March 13, 2025, two days after President Trump signed the 2025 CR, NEH \nChair Shelly Lowe was directed by the White House to resign from her position.  \nPAGE 16 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 17 of 34\n71.  According to accounts of former and current NEH staff, in March 2025, DOGE \npersonnel met with NEH leadership to discuss DOGE’s plans for NEH’s future. \n72.  DOGE has reportedly been deployed to multiple small agencies, in most cases to \nswiftly carry out mass terminations of staff, programs, and grants. \n73.  On April 1, 2025, NEH staff members reportedly were informed that DOGE \nsought reductions in NEH staff by 70-80% and “what could amount to a cancellation of all \n10\ngrants made under the Biden administration that have not been fully paid out.”    \n74.  Upon information and belief, DOGE did not use the Spreadsheet to assess \nwhether any grant constituted fraud, waste, or abuse, or implicated one of the EOs, but rather \nDOGE sought wholesale termination of any grant opened under the Biden Administration. \n75.  Acting Chair Michael McDonald “told senior staff that [DOGE] . . . ‘wants to \n11\nclaw back $175 million’ in grant money that has not yet been disbursed.”    \n76.  While at the NEH, DOGE was provided one or more lists of open NEH grants, \nand DOGE repeatedly asserted that cancelling at least $175 million in grant money was an \nimperative.  According to accounts of former or current NEH employees, very shortly after \nreceiving the list of open NEH grants, on April 2, 2025, DOGE agents emailed nearly 1,500 \ngrantees on the list informing the grantees that their grants were being terminated, including \nnearly all grants issued during the Biden Administration. \n77.  DOGE attempted to send to every state and jurisdictional humanities council a \ngrant termination notice for standard operating grants as well as special opportunity and \ncompetitive grants opened during the Biden Administration.  Most councils received the \ntermination notices in the middle of the night.  \n \n \n10\n Jennifer Schuessler, DOGE Demands Deep Cuts at Humanities Endowment, N.Y.

DOGE did not process the grant terminations through NEH’s eGMS system as \nrequired by internal agency policies. \n79.  The emails received by NEH grantees did not come from an NEH server or email \naddress, but from Grant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com, a non-governmental email \naccount.  \n80.  The emails attached a grant termination letter purportedly signed by Acting \nDirector of NEH Michael McDonald.  The termination letters were not hand-signed by \nMcDonald or digitally signed with a verifiable digital signature.  Instead, the signature on the \ntermination letters was simply typed by someone as “/s/ Michael McDonald.” \n81.  In a meeting with staff to answer questions about the terminations, McDonald \nappeared to acknowledge that he did not determine which grants to terminate, nor did he draft \nthe termination letters.  First, he stated that he had explained NEH’s traditional termination \nprocess but that “as they said in the notification letter. . . they would not be adhering to \ntraditional notification processes” and “they did not feel those should be applied in this \ninstance.”  Further, in response to a question about the rationale for grant terminations, he replied \nthat the “rationale was simply because that’s the way DOGE had operated at other agencies and \n12\nthey applied the same methodology here.”   McDonald also said that any statement about the \nnumber of grants terminated would be “conjecture” on his part, even though he purportedly \nsigned each termination.  \n82.  The termination letters to the Federation, its members, and Oregon Humanities \nsent on April 2 were nearly identical and lacked any individualized analysis or discussion of any \nterminated grant. \n \n \n \n12\n NEH SLT Meeting Recording April 3, 2025 \nhttps://www.rev.com/app/transcript/NjgxMTE2MjgzOGFiYWRjZGM5NTIxYjk5ZEpYN0hBcV\nNYY0xJ/o/VEMwNDc3NTI1NjEz (last visited May 14, 2025).  \nPAGE 18 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 19 of 34\n  The letters contained the following explanation for termination: \nThis letter provides notice that the National Endowment for the \nHumanities  (NEH)  is  terminating  your  federal  grant  (Grant \nApplication No. XXXX) effective April 2, 2025, in accordance with \nthe termination clause in your Grant Agreement. \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities \nand conditions of the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination \ndue to several reasonable causes, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340. \nNEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact \nthat  the  NEH  is  repurposing  its  funding  allocations  in  a  new \ndirection in furtherance of the President’s agenda. The President’s \nFebruary 19, 2025 executive order mandates that the NEH eliminate \nall  non-statutorily  required  activities  and  functions.  See \nCommencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy, E.O. 14217 \n(Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate termination is necessary to \nsafeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal \npriorities. The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority \nfor  the  administration,  and  due  to  exceptional  circumstances, \nadherence to the traditional notification process is not possible. \nTherefore, the NEH hereby terminates your grant in its entirety \neffective April 2, 2025. \n83.  The termination letter to NEH grantees asserts that Executive Order 14217 \n“mandates that the NEH eliminate all non-statutorily required activities and functions.” But NEH \nis not one of the agencies named in the Executive Order for eliminating non-statutorily required \nactivities and functions. \n84.  The termination notices included no reference to any method for appeal or to seek \nreconsideration, even though NEH’s General Terms and Conditions require that grantees have \nthe right to appeal a termination. \n85.  According to former or current NEH staff, instead of having the opportunity to \nweigh-in on termination decisions, relevant staff learned of the grant terminations at the same \ntime that grant recipients received notifications. \n86.  Indeed, according to former or current NEH staff, the terminations were not \nprocessed in NEH’s eGMS system. \nPAGE 19 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 20 of 34\n87.  All of the Federation and its members’ open grants were terminated as part of the \nmass grant termination. \n88.  NEH’s grant terminations were and are unlawful.  NEH has failed to show—let \nalone provide—“good reasons for” any changes in agency policy supposedly justifying the \nterminations.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  And the \nshoddy and capricious justifications Defendants provided to justify the terminations ignore \nimportant and relevant considerations and run counter to the available evidence.  See Motor \nVehicle Mfrs Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto, Ins., Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  For these and \nother reasons, the challenged terminations violate the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2). \n89.  NEH failed entirely to provide notice and opportunity for hearing as required by \nthe NEH statutes. NEH failed entirely to make a “finding” of noncompliance as required by the \nstatutes prior to terminating grants. \n90.  On April 3, 2025, 145 NEH staff members—making up 80% of the staff—were \nreportedly placed on administrative leave.  According to accounts of former or current NEH \nemployees, this included every staff member in the Fed/State Office except for one. \n91.  According to accounts of former or current NEH employees, as a result of the \ntermination of staff and grants, the NEH has effectively eliminated or nearly eliminated entire \ndivisions and programs, including the Fed/State Office. \n92.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, NEH is no longer able to effectuate its \nstatutorily required duties.  It has terminated nearly all of its current grants and most of its future \nprograms, despite having nearly $400 million in funding for programs over the last two years, \nincluding $192 million it received for grant programs in March 2025. \n93.  NEH has terminated the staff necessary to undertake the review and processing of \nstate and jurisdictional council grant applications. NEH has eliminated most of the staff required \nto oversee any grants it does award. \n \nPAGE 20 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 21 of 34\nVI.  Late April “Guidance” from NEH Doubles Down on APA and Constitutional \nViolations. \n94.  On April 24, 2025, NEH issued a press release titled “An Update on Funding \nPriorities and the Agency’s Recent Implementation of Trump Administration Executive Orders.” \nThe statement began, “[i]n recent weeks [NEH] has taken several internal operational steps to \nimprove efficiency, eliminate offices that are not essential to fulfilling its statutory requirements, \nand to return to being a responsible steward of taxpayer funds.”  In answer to the question, “Why \nis NEH cancelling awards,” the agency stated, “[a]ll federal grantmaking agencies, including \nNEH, must ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and are consistent with each \nagency’s mission. This requires that NEH regularly evaluate its funding priorities within the \npolicy framework established by Congress, the Administration, and the head of NEH. Awards \n13\nand programming must align with these priorities.”  \n95.  It is false that the Fed/State Office was “not essential to fulfilling [NEH’s] \nstatutory requirements.” As discussed above, the state and jurisdictional humanities councils are \ncreatures of statute and are provided mandatory funding per the NEH statutes.  \n96.  The agency provided no explanation or information on how it determined that \neach and every approved standard operating grant, money for which was appropriated and \nmandated by Congress, was somehow inconsistent with the agency’s mission or funding \npriorities. On information and belief, no such analysis took place prior to the blanket termination \nof NEH grants to state and jurisdictional humanities councils.  On information and belief, the \nonly factor that went into determining whether a grant should be terminated was whether it was \nopened during the Biden Administration. \n97.  On April 30, 2025, NEH grant recipients including the Federation, Oregon \nHumanities, and all of the Federation’s members, received emails from the NEH Office of Grant \n \n \n13\n An Update on NEH Funding Priorities and the Agency’s Recent Implementation of Trump \nAdministration Executive Orders, https://www.neh.gov/news/update-neh-funding-priorities-and-\nagencys-recent-implementation-trump-administration-executive (last accessed May 14, 2025).  \nPAGE 21 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 22 of 34\nManagement.  The email stated that NEH terminated awards in 2025 and attached “Guidance for \nRecipients of Terminated NEH Awards.”  The guidance provided a process for councils to \nsubmit for “termination costs” associated with terminated grants, defined as “those [costs] \nincurred as a direct result of termination and must be necessary and reasonable to ensure an \norderly shut-down of award activities” as well as “closeout costs,” administrative costs \nassociated with the closeout of a terminated award. \n98.  The April 30th guidance required Plaintiffs to submit complicated and atypical \nvouchers outside the typical NEH process.  It explicitly limited request for reimbursement of \nthese costs to a single form.  (“NEH will not permit subsequent submissions”).   \n99.  Notably, the guidance stated that all grant terminations were permanent and that \nthere would be no appeal process for the agency action.  The “Appeals” section of the guidance \nstates, in its entirety: \n \n \n \nVII.  Plaintiffs are Injured by NEH’s Decisions \n100.  The Trump Administration’s wholesale dismantling of NEH, elimination of the \nFed/State Office, termination of nearly all previously approved standard operating grants, and \ncancellation of numerous programs moving forward has caused and continues to cause Plaintiffs \nserious, irreparable harm. \n101.  Before the terminations, the Federation and its members had multiple active NEH \nawards.  The Federation and its members also planned to apply, and some did apply, for new \nstandard operating grants or for competitive grants.  Many grant applications are “stuck” in \nprocess at NEH, which upon information and belief is no longer processing standard operating \ngrants.   \n102.  For example, a $30,000 grant directly to the Federation to support capacity \nbuilding for councils’ data and evaluation needs, including support for an in-person consultation \nPAGE 22 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 23 of 34\nwith data and evaluation experts, was approved and then cancelled.  Prior to the DOGE \ninterference, the Federation was invited to apply for a much larger $500,000 Cooperative \nAgreement grant with NEH’s Office of Data & Evaluation for a three-year, multi-phased project \nto support the Federation’s hiring of consultants to train councils in data gathering and evaluation \nmethodology, as well as to support a new online platform to support councils.  The Cooperative \nAgreement and budget were drafted in conjunction with NEH staff before DOGE arrived at \nNEH. \n103.  The Federation has also been damaged by councils’ inability to pay Federation \ndues because of funding cuts.  Overall, the Federation has lost approximately 27% of its \nmember-approved 2025 budget. \n104.  The loss of grant opportunities has prevented the Federation and its members \nfrom accomplishing their missions.   \n105.  Each and every member of the Federation has been impacted by grant \nterminations, delays in grant processing, uncertainty regarding the process for challenging grant \nterminations and recovery of costs, and impacts to local grassroots humanities organizations.  \nRelationships with community partners who rely upon state and jurisdictional council grant \nfunding have been irrevocably damaged.  Several of the Federation’s members are facing the risk \nof imminent shut down. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCount 1 \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1): Unlawful Withholding and/or \nUnreasonable Delay of Agency Action \n106.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n107.  The APA authorizes a court to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed.”  5 U.S.C. §706(1).  Relief is warranted under this provision where an \nagency completely fails to take, or unreasonably delays in taking, “a discrete agency action that \nPAGE 23 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 24 of 34\nit is required to take.”  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004) (emphasis \nomitted). \n108.  By statute and regulation, “discrete agency action[s]” that NEH is required to take \ninclude: calculation and distribution of funds appropriated by Congress using the statutory \nformulas, review and approval of grant applications, and processing of reimbursement requests.  \nThe APA provides that, “within a reasonable time, each agency shall proceed to conclude a \nmatter presented to it.”  5 U.S.C. §555(b) (emphasis added).   \n109.  As discussed, Defendants have actually or constructively terminated and/or \nsubstantially delayed the above-described required activities of the NEH’s grant review and \napproval processes—a significant and unprecedented departure from the NEH’s published \nreview process and the agency’s past practice. \n110.  As discussed, NEH statutes provide that for Congressionally appropriated funds \nfor any fiscal year, “each State and each grant recipient which has a plan approved by the \nChairperson shall be allotted at least $200,000. . . .  In any case where the sums available to \ncarry out this subsection for any fiscal year are in excess of the amount required to make the \nallotments under the first sentence of this paragraph,” certain additional amounts “shall be \nallotted” among the state and jurisdictional councils. 20 U.S.C. § 956(f)(4) (emphasis added).  \n111.  The NEH regulations further provide the NEH will process reimbursements to \ncouncils with previously approved grants and set forth a statutory process for any grant \ntermination, which has not been followed.   \n112.  The above-described terminations and delays constitute unlawful withholding \nand/or unreasonable delay of agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. §706(1) of the APA.  \nSee, e.g., Rezaii v. Kennedy, No. 1:24-cv-10838, 2025 WL 750215, at *5 (D. Mass. Feb. 24, \n2025) (holding that a plaintiff had pleaded unreasonable delay where, among other things, the \nagency’s delay in processing plaintiff’s application was “at the outer edge of HHS’s typical time \nfor processing”); Raouf v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 702 F. Supp. 3d 19, 33 (D. N.H. 2023) (finding \nPAGE 24 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 25 of 34\nthat a plaintiff had pleaded unreasonable delay where she alleged that the “delay [was] \nattributable to . . . an ultra vires internal policy for intentionally delaying issuance of visas”). \n113.  The above-described terminations and delays have caused, are causing, and \nimminently threaten to cause direct, concrete, and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs.  As discussed \nabove, the harms from these cancellations and delays of grants have included layoffs, \ncancellation of programming, inability to meet financial obligations, and difficulty making rent \npayments. \n114.  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order, and to a preliminary \nand permanent injunction, compelling Defendants to undertake the activities of NEH’s Fed/State \nOffice and any NEH Office required to act on Fed/State issues, including but not limited to the \nNational Council on the Humanities, that Defendants have unlawfully withheld and/or \nunreasonably delayed.  Such activities include staffing the Fed/State Office; providing guidance \nto the state and jurisdictional humanities councils regarding grant applications and procedures; \nproviding an appeal mechanism for grant terminations or rejections; applying the statutory \nformulas to determine distributions among the state and jurisdictional councils; and processing \nopen and pending grants.  \nCount 2 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2): Agency Action Contrary to Law \n(Grant Terminations) \n115.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n116.  The APA authorizes a court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law” and/or “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2). \n117.  As discussed, Defendants have invoked 2 CFR § 200.340 in canceling the grants.  \nHowever, that regulation does not apply here and does not authorize the cancellation of the \nPAGE 25 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 26 of 34\ngrants because there has been no failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the awards \nor consent by the Federation’s members.    \n118.  Defendant McDonald has not made findings required by the statutes to terminate \ngrants, has not provided notice and an opportunity to be heard, and has not sought approval of \nthe Council for grant terminations.    \n119.  The statutes and regulations that govern the administration of grants by the NEH \nset out specific conditions and procedures for terminating and suspending grants.  Defendants \nhave not followed the procedures set out in those governing statutes and regulations and have \nfrozen payment on grants in circumstances in which the statutes and regulations would not allow \nthose grants to be terminated or suspended. By doing so, Defendants are acting contrary to law.  \n120.  DOGE, an agent of the Executive Branch, does not have authority to terminate \nmandatory funding from Congress.  Its actions are ultra vires and an unconstitutional violation of \nSeparation of Powers and are unlawful for that reason, as well.  \n121.  In addition or in the alternative, on information and belief, Defendant Director \nMcDonald has acted contrary to law by withholding purportedly necessary approvals to the NEH \nto release funding appropriated by Congress and by failing to convene the Council. \n122.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order and judgment, and a preliminary \nand permanent injunction, holding unlawful and setting aside Defendants’ termination of the \nterminated grants and the staff directives to and within NEH underlying the terminations.   \nCount 3 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2): Agency Action Contrary to Statute \n(Dismantling of Fed/State; Internal NEH and Fed/State Functions) \n123.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n124.  The APA requires a court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nPAGE 26 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 27 of 34\nshort of statutory right,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), or “otherwise not in accordance with law,” id. § \n706(2)(A).  \n125.  In reviewing agency action, a court cannot accept “the agency’s policy judgments \n. . . if they conflict with the policy judgments that undergird the statutory scheme.”  Health Ins. \nAss’n of Am., Inc. v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 412, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1994); see Brown & Williamson \nTobacco Corp. v. FDA, 153 F.3d 155, 176 (4th Cir. 1998), aff’d, 529 U.S. 120 (2000) \n(explaining that “federal agencies” cannot “substitute their policy judgments for those of \nCongress”). \n126.  Defendants have terminated certain of the terminated grants on the ground that \nthey “no longer effectuate[] the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions of the Grant \nAgreement and is subject to termination due to several reasonable causes” because, according to \nDefendants, the terminations are “necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, \nincluding its fiscal priorities. The termination of [the] grant represents an urgent priority for the \nadministration, and due to exceptional circumstances, adherence to the traditional notification \nprocess is not possible.”  See ¶ 81 above.  \n127.  The mass terminations defy statutory directives which require that NEH “shall” \nfund the state and jurisdictional humanities councils as set forth above.  The mass terminations \nalso violate statutes and regulations pertaining to process for terminations and opportunity for \nappeal.   \n128.  Defendants’ mass terminations are also contrary to law because they defy \nCongress’s consistent appropriation of funding to NEH’s state and jurisdictional affiliates to \ncarry out their respective statutory purposes and public priorities.  \n129.  Defendants’ actions are also contrary to law because they violate the \nConstitution’s separation of powers between Congress under Article I and the President and \nExecutive Branch under Article II.    \n130.  NEH is violating its statutory obligations by terminating thousands of grants, \nwhich will result in a substantial portion of Congress’s appropriation going unspent. \nPAGE 27 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 28 of 34\n131.  The terminations therefore are contrary to the statutes authorizing and \nappropriating funds for the NEH and its state and jurisdictional affiliates, and beyond \nDefendants’ statutory authority, and must be set aside. \n132.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order and judgment, and a preliminary \nand permanent injunction, holding unlawful and setting aside Defendants’ dismantling of the \nFed/State Office, the termination of the terminated grants and the staff directives to and within \nthe NEH underlying the terminations and ordering the funds allocated to Fed/State in the Fiscal \nYear 2024 Budget and 2025 CR to be allocated among the state and jurisdictional councils \npursuant to the statutory formulas. Plaintiffs are further entitled to an order and judgment, and \npreliminary and permanent injunction, requiring the continued operation of the Fed/State Office \nand its grant review processes and procedures for allocation of all congressionally mandated \nfunds to the state and jurisdictional humanities councils.  \nCount 4 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2): Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n133.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n134.  The APA requires a court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. §706 (2)(A). \n135.  An agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has “relied on factors \nwhich Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of \nthe problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \nagency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of \nagency expertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 U.S. at 43.  An agency action is also arbitrary \nand capricious if, when departing from a prior policy, an agency does not “display awareness \nthat it is changing position” or does not “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.”  \nFox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515. \nPAGE 28 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 29 of 34\n136.  As described above, Defendants have terminated the Plaintiffs’ grants on the \nground that they “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities.”  Defendants have \ncommunicated these termination decisions through boilerplate letters, using stock language for a \nlarge swath of varied grants. \n137.  Defendants’ decisions are arbitrary and capricious because their boilerplate letters \ndo not acknowledge—let alone provide “good reasons for”—any official change in agency \npolicy.  Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515.  Indeed, this boilerplate language obfuscates \nthe obvious, actual reason for the terminations: implementation of the President’s EOs and other \npolicies.  While the White House and DOGE initially asked NEH to comb through its open \ngrants to determine whether each grant ran afoul of the EOs, and to rate each grant’s “risk level,” \nDOGE ultimately mass terminated NEH grants without any such analysis (which would also \nhave been arbitrary and capricious under the law) and instead determined that any grants opened \nunder the Biden Administration were subject to termination.  Such a patently false explanation \ndoes not satisfy the requirement to provide a reasoned basis for agency decision making. \n138.  Defendants’ funding freeze decisions also fail to account for the substantial \nreliance interests in the ordinary disbursement of funds authorized by the NEH that the freeze \nradically disrupts. “When an agency changes course . . . it must be cognizant that longstanding \npolicies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account,’’ and the \nfailure to do so is arbitrary and capricious.  DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 \n(2020) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n139.   Defendants’ termination decisions are arbitrary and capricious for the additional \nreason that they have not engaged in reasoned consideration of any individual project before \nterminating a grant. \n140.  Defendants’ termination decisions are arbitrary and capricious for the additional \nreason that, in purporting to terminate the Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ members’ grants, Defendants \nfailed to consider several important aspects of the issues before them, including, at a minimum \n(1) Plaintiffs’ reliance interests in the terminated projects; (2) whether those projects could be \nPAGE 29 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 30 of 34\nadjusted, rather than terminated, to comply with Defendants’ new “priorities” (assuming those \nnew “priorities” were otherwise lawful); (3) whether Defendants could have adopted a measure \nother than across-the-board termination of entire categories of grants to effectuate their new \n“priorities” (assuming those new “priorities” were otherwise lawful); and (4) the harm that \nterminating the grants would inflict on U.S. citizens benefiting from the authorized grant activity. \n141.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order and judgment, and a preliminary \nand permanent injunction, holding unlawful and setting aside Defendants’ termination of the \nPlaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ members’ grants and the staff directives to and within NEH underlying \nthe terminations.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to an order and judgment that NEH’s \npronouncement that Fed/State was “not essential to fulfilling [NEH’s] statutory requirements” \nwas arbitrary and capricious and requiring the rehiring of staff to fulfill the critical work of \nFed/State at NEH, including the grant application, processing, approval, and other work \nnecessary within eGMS to fund the state and jurisdictional humanities councils as required by \nstatute. \nCount 5 \nSeparation of Powers \n142.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n143.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 326–27 (2015). \n144.  The Constitution “grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.”  \nCity & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018); see U.S. Const. \nart. I, §9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, §8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause).  “Among \nCongress’s most important authorities is its control of the purse.”  Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. \n477, 505 (2023).  “The Appropriations Clause is thus a bulwark of the Constitution’s separation \nof powers among the three branches of the National Government.”  U.S. Dep’t of Navy v. Fed. \nPAGE 30 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 31 of 34\nLab. Rels. Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, J.).  If not for the \nAppropriations Clause, “the executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse \nof the nation.”  Id. (internal citations omitted). \n145.  Congress also possesses exclusive power to legislate.  Article I, Section 1 of the \nConstitution states that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of \nthe United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.”  U.S. Const. \nart. I, §1; see Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (“There is no provision in \nthe Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”) \n146.  The Constitution further provides that the executive must “take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3; see Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 \nU.S. 302, 327 (2014) (“Under our system of government, Congress makes the laws and the \nPresident . . . faithfully executes them.” (brackets and quotation marks omitted)). \n147.  The Executive Branch violates the Take Care Clause where it declines to execute \nor otherwise undermines statutes enacted by Congress and signed into law or duly promulgated \nregulations implementing such statutes.  See In re United Mine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 \nF.3d 545, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[T]he President is without authority to set aside congressional \nlegislation by executive order . . . .”);  Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838) \n(rejecting argument that by charging the President with faithful execution of the laws, the Take \nCare clause “implies a power to forbid their execution”); see also Util. Air. Reg. Grp., 573 U.S. \nat 327 (noting that the President “act[s] at time through agencies”). \n148.  Nor does any statute authorize the Executive’s action here.  Congress consistently \nhas appropriated funds to NEH to further its statutory purposes of advancing the humanities \nnation-wide and has not authorized the Executive to decline to spend vast swaths of funds. \nFurther, Congress has provided for a procedure by which the Executive may propose to Congress \nto either rescind or cancel funds.  Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, \n2 U.S.C. §§ 682 et seq.  That statute likewise does not permit the Executive to take unilateral \naction, instead requiring the President must “propose[]” any rescission to Congress (which \nPAGE 31 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 32 of 34\nCongress must then affirmatively approve) and may not defer funding for the policy reasons \nDefendants explicitly invoke here. 2 U.S.C. §§ 683, 684(a).    \n149.  Accordingly, consistent with these principles, the Executive’s authority is at its \n“lowest ebb” because he is acting without constitutional authority and contrary to the will of \nCongress by attempting to unilaterally decline to spend appropriated funds.  See Youngstown \nSheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637–38 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n150.  Defendants’ pattern and policy of systematic delays and terminations—as \nreflected in their treatment of the Plaintiffs’ grants—therefore violates the separation-of-powers \nconstraints described above.  Through these actions, Defendants have overridden the careful \njudgments of Congress by refusing to disburse duly appropriated funding.   \n151.  The delays and terminations are also contrary to the principle that funding \nrestrictions can only impose conditions that are reasonably related to the federal interest in the \nproject and the project’s objectives.  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207–08 (1987).  Here, the \ndelays and terminations are not related to the federal interest in the humanities—to support and \nencourage promotion of scholarship in the humanities—and instead are related to policies and \npolitical factors.  \n152.  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction barring Defendants from maintaining their pattern and policy of systematic delays and \nterminations—as reflected in their treatment of the delayed grant applications, delayed \nreimbursements and approvals, and terminated grants.  For the same reasons, Plaintiffs are \nentitled, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2201, to a declaration that Defendants’ pattern and policy of \nsystematic delays and terminations—as reflected in their treatment of the delayed grant \nprocessing and terminated grants—violates the Constitution’s guarantee of separation of powers. \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \nPAGE 32 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 33 of 34\nCount 6 \nImplied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions, Actions by DOGE \nwithout Legal Authority (Against Defendants DOGE and Gleason) \n153.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n154.  Federal agencies “possess only the authority that Congress has provided.”  Nat’l \nFed. of Indep. Bus. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). “[A]n agency literally has no power to \nact . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”  La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 \nU.S. 355, 374 (1986). \n155.  Congress did not create DOGE and has not vested DOGE with any powers. \nRather, DOGE is an agency that was created by the President via Executive Order 145.  \n156.  DOGE has not been authorized by Congress to conduct business of another \ncongressionally authorized agency such as the NEH. \n157.  The actions set forth above, including the dismantling of Fed/State and the \ntermination of all grants approved during the Biden Administration, were directly undertaken by, \nor specifically directed by DOGE.   \n158.  Because DOGE does not possess any congressionally conferred authority to \nterminate the NEH’s grants and contracts, or to eliminate the Fed/State Office at NEH, DOGE \nand Gleason’s actions are ultra vires and should be enjoined and declared unlawful.  \nCount 7 \nAttorney Fees \n159.  Upon prevailing, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorney fees under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows:  \nA.  Declare unlawful and enter an order and an injunction compelling Defendants to \nundertake the activities of NEH that Defendants have unlawfully withheld and/or unreasonably \ndelayed, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1);  \nPAGE 33 –  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00829-SI      Document 1      Filed 05/15/25      Page 34 of 34\nB.

Enjoin Defendants from enforcing and giving effect to the termination notices of \nthe Federation’s grants and its members’ grants;  \nF.  Enjoin Defendants to obligate and spend the full amount of funds that Congress \nhas appropriated to the Federal State partnership at NEH without intentional delay;  \nG.
