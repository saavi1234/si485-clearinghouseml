    "summary": "<p>This case is about the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s (DHS) alleged unlawful withholding of congressionally appropriated anti-terrorism funds from major U.S. cities, undermining local efforts to maintain public safety and preparedness. On May 16, 2025, the City of Chicago filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against DHS and its Secretary. The plaintiffs challenged the freezing of funds under the Securing the Cities counterterrorism program, which supported efforts to prevent nuclear and other terrorist attacks in high-risk urban areas. The plaintiffs claimed that since February 2025, the defendants had not processed Chicago&rsquo;s reimbursement requests for pre-approved expenditures under the program. The plaintiffs alleged that the funding freeze exceeded the defendants&rsquo; statutory authority and violated both the Separation of Powers and the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by public counsel from the City of Chicago Department of Law, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from freezing the funding and to require them to process all pending and future reimbursement requests in accordance with the law. The case was assigned to District Judge John Joseph Tharp Jr.</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the cities of San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, and Boston as plaintiffs. The amended filing detailed each city&rsquo;s reliance on the Securing the Cities program and the harms caused by DHS&rsquo;s freeze on 2025 reimbursements and its failure to release approved 2024 funds. While the original complaint emphasized Administrative Procedure Act violations, the amended filing placed greater weight on the Appropriations Clause, arguing that DHS&rsquo;s withholding of congressionally allocated funds was unlawful. It also highlighted the urgency of restoring funding before major events requiring heightened security, including political conventions and national holidays.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Congress passed, and President Trump signed, a law establishing Securing the \nCities. Congress explained that Securing the Cities seeks to prevent nuclear and other terrorist \nattacks in high-risk urban areas. To accomplish this purpose, Congress mandated that DHS \nimplement Securing the Cities by providing resources to local governments. \n2.  Pursuant to this mandate, DHS has for years entered into cooperative agreements \nthat award funds to Chicago and 12 other regions that DHS deems to be at an elevated risk of \nsustaining terrorist attacks. The cooperative agreements expressly identify ways in which local \ngovernments  may  spend  Securing  the  Cities  funds  and  require  DHS’s  pre-approval  before \n  1 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 2 of 19 PageID #:2\nincurring other costs.  \n3.  For example, the Chicago Fire Department has used Securing the Cities funds to \nbuy equipment designed to detect nuclear and other radiological materials—equipment that is \ncritical to protecting public safety. After incurring these and other costs, Chicago periodically \nseeks reimbursement from DHS. Until recently, DHS typically reimbursed Chicago within 72 \nhours of receiving the City’s request. \n4.  All that changed in recent months. Since February 21, 2025, Chicago has submitted \nfive requests to reimburse the City for pre-approved expenditures totaling more than $1 million. \nDHS has effectively ignored Chicago’s requests. \n5.  On information and belief, DHS’s inaction is part of a programmatic freeze of \nfunding  under  Securing  the  Cities.  In  response  to  Chicago’s  many  inquiries  about  its \nreimbursement requests, a federal employee explained that Chicago’s requests were “approved,” \nbut that “[a]ll DHS-OPO [Office of Procurement Operations] payments are on pause.” Confirming \nthis, other regions that receive Securing the Cities funding have told Chicago that DHS has ignored \ntheir reimbursement requests too. And just two days ago, DHS told Securing the Cities regions \nthat they “must pause … all radiological and nuclear detection equipment purchases” due to \nsupposed “funding constraints.” Indeed, it is unclear whether the DHS office responsible for \nSecuring the Cities will even continue to exist: press reports indicate that the so-called Department \nof Government Efficiency intends to dismantle that office. \n6.  DHS’s funding freeze is unconstitutional. The United States Constitution assigns \nCongress the responsibility to enact laws and appropriate funds, while requiring the executive \nbranch to execute those laws. Congress enacted Securing the Cities and required DHS to provide \nresources to local governments to implement the program. DHS cannot override Congress’s \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 3 of 19 PageID #:3\njudgment by freezing congressionally appropriated funding. \n7.  DHS’s funding freeze also violates the Administrative Procedure Act. Governing \nregulations require federal agencies to reimburse funding recipients “within 30 calendar days after \nreceipt of the payment request unless the Federal agency [] reasonably believes the request to be \nimproper.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). DHS has not so much as suggested that there is anything \n“improper” about Chicago’s requests. On the contrary, the federal government told Chicago that \nits reimbursement requests were “approved,” but that “[a]ll” such requests are “paused.” \n8.  Accordingly, Chicago seeks an order enjoining Defendants from freezing funding \nunder Securing the Cities and requiring that Defendants process pending and future reimbursement \nrequests pursuant to law. \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff City of Chicago is a municipal corporation and home rule unit organized \nand existing under the constitution and laws of the State of Illinois. \n10.  Defendant United States Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet agency \nwithin the executive branch of the United States government. 6 U.S.C. § 111. \n11.  Defendant Kristi Noem is the Secretary of DHS and is that agency’s highest-\nranking official. Noem is charged with supervising and managing all DHS decisions and actions. \n6 U.S.C. § 112. Chicago sues Noem in her official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346. \nJurisdiction is also proper under the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure \nAct, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, 706. \n13.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Illinois under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 4 of 19 PageID #:4\nbecause substantial events giving rise to this action occurred in the district, Chicago resides in the \ndistrict, and no real property is involved in this action. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  Congress Established, and Directed DHS to Implement, Securing the Cities. \n \n14.  In the wake of the September 11th attacks, Congress created DHS and tasked the \nagency with reducing the United States’ vulnerability to terrorism. \n15.  In 2005, President George W. Bush directed DHS to “establish a national level \nDomestic Nuclear Detection Office.” According to the President, the Domestic Nuclear Detection \nOffice would “[s]erve as the primary entity in the United States Government to further develop, \nacquire, and support the deployment of an enhanced domestic system to detect and report on \nattempts to import, possess, store, transport, develop, or use an unauthorized nuclear explosive \ndevice, fissile material, or radiological material in the United States, and improve that system over \ntime.”1 Congress later established the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in statute. See 6 U.S.C. \n§§ 591-596A. \n16.  In 2007, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office created a pilot initiative called \n“Securing the Cities” to help the highest-risk U.S. cities detect nuclear and radiological materials \nas well as respond to terrorist attacks. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office selected the New \nYork City/Jersey City/Newark region as the first pilot region for Securing the Cities.2 \n17.  Between  2012  and  2017,  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office  added  the \nChicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC regions to Securing the Cities because the \n \n1 National Security Presidential Directive Nspd-43 (Apr. 15, 2005), https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-\n43.html. \n2 United States Department of Homeland Security, Securing the Cities Implementation Plan for Fiscal Year \n2022 at 2  (Nov. 4, 2022) (“2022 STC Plan”), www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/CWMD%20-\n%20Securing%20the%20Cities%20implementation%20Plan.pdf. \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 5 of 19 PageID #:5\nOffice deemed them to be “high-risk” areas. The Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Maricopa County, \nMiami, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Seattle regions were later added to Securing the Cities.3 \n18.  In 2018, Congress passed—and President Trump signed—the Countering Weapons \nof Mass Destruction Act. That Act required DHS to “establish” Securing the Cities “to enhance \nthe ability of the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high-consequence \nevents utilizing nuclear or other radiological materials that pose a high risk to homeland security \nin high-risk urban areas.” 6 U.S.C. § 596b. Through Securing the Cities, DHS “shall—provide \nresources to enhance detection, analysis, communication, and coordination to better integrate \nState, local, Tribal, and territorial assets into Federal operations … [and] provide augmenting \nresources, as appropriate, to enable State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to sustain and \nrefresh their capabilities developed under the STC program.” Id. § 596b(b)(3) & (6). \n19.  The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act renamed the Domestic Nuclear \nDetection Office as the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which is “responsible \nfor coordinating Federal efforts and developing a strategy and policy for the Department to plan \nfor, detect, and protect against the importation, possession, storage, transportation, development, \nor use of unauthorized chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear materials, devices, or agents \nin the United States and to protect against an attack using such materials, devices, or agents against \nthe people, territory, or interests of the United States.” Id. § 591g. \n20.  Congress  has  annually  appropriated  funds  “[f]or  necessary  expenses  of  the \nCountering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office for Federal assistance through grants, contracts, \ncooperative agreements, and other activities.” Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. \n \n3  Id.;  United  States  Government  Accountability  Office,  Nuclear  Terrorism Prevention:  DHS  Has \nStrengthened  the Securing the Cities Program,  but  Actions  Are  Needed  to  Address  Key  Remaining \nChallenges at 1-2 (Mar. 2024) (“GAO Report”), www.gao.gov/assets/870/867470.pdf. \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 6 of 19 PageID #:6\n116-260, 134 Stat. 1182; accord, e.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. \n118-47, 138 Stat. 613. \n21.  Congress has consistently supported Securing the Cities on a bipartisan basis. As \nrecently as March 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed on a voice vote the Securing \nthe Cities Improvement Act, which seeks to strengthen the program in response to the New Orleans \nBourbon Street attack in January 2025. See H.R. 1374, 119th Cong. (2025); see also 171 Cong. \nRec. H1056-57 (Mar. 10, 2025) (statements of Reps. Correa and Green). \n22.  There is good reason for this bipartisan consensus. As the U.S. Government \nAccountability Office explained in a report about Securing the Cities, “[t]he U.S. faces an enduring \nthreat that terrorists could steal or smuggle nuclear or radiological materials to use in a terrorist \nattack, and efforts to counter such threats are considered a top national priority.” The goal of \nSecuring the Cities “is to enhance the ability of the U.S. to detect and prevent the malevolent use \nof nuclear and radioactive materials that pose risks to high-risk urban areas.”4 \n23.  DHS, now acting though the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, has \nimplemented  Congress’s  directives  by  entering  into  “cooperative  agreements”  with  local \ngovernments in each Securing the Cities region. Unlike grants, cooperative agreements are used \nwhen  the  federal  agency  will  be  “substantial[ly]  involve[d]”  in  “carrying  out  the  activity \ncontemplated in the agreement.” 31 U.S.C. § 6305. Compare id. § 6304 (grants). \n24.  Under these cooperative agreements, a local governmental agency in each Securing \nthe Cities region is responsible for managing the regional program, coordinating with other local \ngovernmental agencies, and reporting that region’s progress to DHS.5 \n25.  Cooperative  agreements  under  Securing  the  Cities  provide  funding  on  a \n \n4 GAO Report, supra, at 1-2. \n5 2022 STC Plan, supra, at 2. \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 7 of 19 PageID #:7\nreimbursement basis. In other words, funding recipients (a) incur costs that are either expressly \npermitted in cooperative agreements or that DHS pre-approves on an individualized basis and then \n(b) request reimbursement for those costs. \n26.  Since 2020, DHS has entered into Securing the Cities cooperative agreements that \nprovide for a ten-year period of performance. According to the U.S. Government Accountability \nOffice, Securing the Cities regions may be unable to “maintain and sustain capabilities over time \nwithout a dedicated source of [long-term] federal funding,” instead forced to “delay[]” critical \nwork to focus on “short-term efforts.”6 \nII.  Chicago Entered into Cooperative Agreements with DHS. \n \n27.  In 2015, DHS selected Chicago as a Securing the Cities region based on DHS’s \ndetermination that Chicago is at a “high risk” of sustaining a terrorist attack. Indeed, DHS has \nconsistently ranked the Chicago region in the top 5 metropolitan statistical areas in terms of \nterrorism risk. DHS continues to assess Chicago as a “Threat Level I”—the highest threat level—\nwhich DHS defines as having credible and specific international and domestic terrorist threats \nbased on Intelligence Community reports. \n28.  In 2016, DHS entered into a cooperative agreement with Chicago, acting through \nthe City’s Fire Department.  \n29.  The 2016 award letter obligated DHS to pay $3.5 million in Securing the Cities \nfunds to Chicago, for a project period of 2016 to 2021.  \n30.  DHS stated that the 2016 award “will enable the City of Chicago, Fire Department \nto provide regional partners radiological and nuclear detection capabilities to reduce risk along \nroadway, light and heavy rail, and maritime pathways.” DHS also stated that the award “will \n \n6 GAO Report, supra, at 15-16. \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 8 of 19 PageID #:8\nprovide assistance that will allow regional partners to acquire equipment, training, and support to \nfurther the radiological and nuclear detection mission in the Chicago Region.” \n31.  DHS celebrated the 2016 award, issuing a press release stating that the agency was \n“building on [its] ongoing efforts to increase the Nation’s capabilities to detect and protect against \nradiological and nuclear threats.” \n32.  From 2017 through 2020, DHS sent several “please apply” letters asking the \nChicago Fire Department to apply “[t]o facilitate continuation funding” under the 2016 award. \nChicago applied for and received an additional $16,575,000 for the same project period of 2016 to \n2021. \n33.  In or about 2021, DHS sent a Notice of Funding Opportunity to the Chicago Fire \nDepartment, proposing to continue providing Securing the Cities funding to Chicago for a project \nperiod of 2021 to 2030. \n34.  The Notice of Funding Opportunity explained that Securing the Cities seeks to \n“further the nuclear detection mission in the region” and “[a]chieve better integration of Federal, \nState, and local capabilities allowing regional support to national operations.” \n35.  The Notice of Funding Opportunity (a) listed equipment that recipients could buy \nand training that recipients could provide using Securing the Cities funds and (b) required \nrecipients to obtain “prior approval of DHS” to procure other equipment or provide other services. \n36.  The  Chicago  Fire  Department  later  applied  for  the  2021  Securing  the  Cities \nfunding, providing proposed budgets, project plans, financials, and other information required by \nDHS.  \n37.  In July 2021, DHS entered into a new cooperative agreement  with Chicago, \nawarding $650,000 in Securing the Cities funds. \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 9 of 19 PageID #:9\n38.  From 2022 through 2024, DHS sent annual “please apply” letters to the Chicago \nFire Department. After the Fire Department submitted the requested applications, DHS awarded \nan additional $2,525,000 to Chicago for the same project period of 2021 to 2030. \n39.  The Chicago Fire Department has implemented Securing the Cities by, among other \nactions: \na.  entering into memoranda of understanding with its principal partners in the \nChicago  region:  the  Chicago  Police  Department,  Chicago’s  Office  of  Emergency \nManagement and Communications, the Cook County Sherriff’s Office, the Illinois State \nPolice, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency; \nb.  developing an STC-Chicago Regional Operation Plan, Strategic Plan, and \nImplementation Plan—plans for Chicago-region partners to prepare for, and respond to, \nnuclear and/or radiological threats in the region; \nc.  buying equipment to detect nuclear and radiological materials, including to \nenhance detection systems across transportation routes leading to Chicago; \nd.  creating and implementing a program that trains employees to use this \nequipment and respond to terrorist attacks; \ne.  conducting drills on preventing and responding to terrorist attacks using \nnuclear and radiological materials; \nf.  conducting sweeps and providing other services at pre-planned special \nevents, including the 2024 Democratic and Republican National Conventions; \ng.  strengthening  partnerships  with  local  agencies  while  expanding \ncollaboration with Indiana and Wisconsin; and \nh.  paying the salaries of Fire Department employees responsible for managing \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 10 of 19 PageID #:10\nthe program. \n40.  Since  Chicago’s  inclusion  in  Securing  the  Cities,  Chicago  has  periodically \nsubmitted reimbursement requests for these and other pre-approved expenditures. Until recently, \nDHS typically reimbursed Chicago within 72 hours of receiving the City’s request. \nIII.  DHS Froze Securing the Cities Funding.  \n41.  Since February 21, 2025, Chicago has submitted five requests for reimbursement \nunder Securing the Cities for a total of $1,191,321.18: \na.  On February 21, 2025, Chicago requested $43,013.83; \nb.  Also on February 21, 2025, Chicago separately requested $428,669.98;  \nc.  On March 13, 2025, Chicago requested $26,035.05;  \nd.  On April 3, 2025, Chicago requested $30,632.53; and  \ne.  On April 18, 2025, Chicago requested $662,969.79. \n42.  Through these requests, Chicago seeks reimbursement for money that the City has \nspent on equipment designed to detect nuclear materials, payroll, and other products or services \nthat are either expressly authorized by the cooperative agreements or that DHS pre-approved. \n43.  DHS has not acted on any of these five requests. \n44.  On March 3, 2025, Chicago requested a status update on the City’s February 21 \nreimbursement requests from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services employee Vivian \nHughes, who assists Chicago with drawdown requests made through the federal government’s \nPayment Management Services system. Hughes responded: “All DHS-OPO payments are on \npause. The payment has been approved but not yet release[d] for payment. We must await guidance \nfrom DHS ….” Hughes instructed Chicago to “contact your grant officer directly.” \n45.  On March 4 and March 11, 2025, Chicago emailed its DHS grant officer about the \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 11 of 19 PageID #:11\nCity’s pending reimbursement requests. The grant officer did not respond. \n46.  On March 19, 2025, Chicago emailed Vivian Hughes again to inquire when DHS \nanticipated reimbursing Chicago. Hughes responded: “The payment has been approved but not yet \nrelease[d] for payment. We must await guidance from DHS … . If you have any questions, contact \nyour grants officer directly.” \n47.  The same day, Chicago emailed another DHS grant officer to request an update \nabout the City’s pending reimbursement requests. The grant officer responded: “I am sorry to say, \nI have no further information on your question. We are awaiting guidance on this issue. As soon \nas we have information to provide, we will do so.” \n48.  On April 10, 2025, Chicago wrote a letter to DHS demanding that the agency \nreimburse the City for its Securing the Cities expenditures within 10 days. DHS neither responded \nto Chicago’s letter nor resolved Chicago’s pending reimbursement requests. \n49.  Neither Defendants nor any other federal agency or employee have told Chicago \nthe legal basis for freezing Securing the Cities funding. \n50.  On May 14, 2025, DHS notified all Securing the Cities regions that “the STC \nprogram must pause … all radiological nuclear detection equipment and supplies purchases,” \nciting supposed “Federal funding constraints.” This notification is part of DHS’s funding freeze. \n51.  DHS’s freeze on Securing the Cities funding and equipment purchases may be \nexplained by press reports indicating that the Department of Government Efficiency has marked \nthe Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office for termination.7 A former head of the \nCountering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office stated that dismantling the Office “would \n \n7 Josh Marshall, DOGE Poised to Nix WMD Office at DHS, TALKING POINTS MEMO, Apr. 8, 2025, \ntalkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/doge-poised-to-nix-wmd-office-at-dhs;  see  also  Justin  Ling,  Pentagon \nCuts Threaten Programs That Secure Losse Nukes and Weapons of Mass Destruction, WIRED, Mar. 6, \n2025, www.wired.com/story/pentagon-cuts-nukes-chemical-weapons-wmd. \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 12 of 19 PageID #:12\nincrease the likelihood of a successful attack” and leave cities hosting events like the World Cup \nand Summer Olympics “scrambling to find the tools, expertise and personnel needed to guard \nagainst weapons of mass destruction threats.”8  \n52.  It is unclear who is even leading the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction \nOffice now. The Trump Administration recently fired Acting FEMA Administrator Cameron \nHamilton and replaced him with David Richardson—who had been, and perhaps still is, the head \nof the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.9 \n53.  In any case, Chicago’s work with DHS on Securing the Cities is ongoing. In late \nMarch 2025, the then-head of DHS’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office visited \nChicago to meet with Chicago’s Securing the Cities leadership “to discuss detection equipment \nneeds, the program’s status, and to see if there are any areas [the Countering Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Office] can improve upon in supporting the state and local team.”10 \n54.  Moreover, Chicago continues to incur costs implementing Securing the Cities and \nintends to seek reimbursement for those costs in the future. Even if DHS satisfies Chicago’s \npending reimbursement requests, Chicago will have more than $4 million remaining in Securing \nthe Cities funding that the City may use through 2030, in addition to any additional funding that \nCongress appropriates in the future. \n   \n \n8 Mary Ellen Callahan, The Consequences of eliminating the DHS WMD office could be catastrophic, THE \nHILL, Apr. 11, 2025, thehill.com/opinion/national-security/5242861-threats-homeland-security-weapons-\nmass-destruction. \n9 Nicole Sganga, FEMA leader fired after breaking with Trump administration on eliminating agency, CBS \nNEWS, May 9, 2025, www.cbsnews.com/news/fema-leader-fired-trump-administration-cameron-hamilton. \n10 United States Department of Homeland Security, Press Release, CWMD Meets with Chicago Area \nBioWatch and STC Partners, https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/04/cwmd-meets-chicago-area-biowatch-\nand-stc-partners. \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 13 of 19 PageID #:13\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nSeparation of Powers \n55.  Chicago repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n56.  The Constitution provides that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1. “There is no provision in the \nConstitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” Clinton v. City \nof N.Y., 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998). \n57.  Instead, the President must “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. \nConst. Art. II, Sec. 3; see Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 327 (2014) (“Congress makes \nthe laws and the President, sometimes acting through agencies … ‘faithfully execute[s]’ them”). \nThe Executive Branch violates the Take Care Clause when it declines to execute or otherwise \nundermines statutes enacted by Congress or regulations implementing statutes. See In re United \nMine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 F.3d 545, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“the President is without \nauthority to set aside congressional legislation by executive order”); Kendall v. United States, 37 \nU.S. 524, 613 (1838) (rejecting argument that by charging the President with faithful execution of \nthe laws, the Take Care clause “implies a power to forbid their execution”). \n58.  Moreover, the Constitution “grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \nPresident.” City & Cnty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018); see U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause). \n59.  The Constitution’s delegation of authority to Congress “provides institutional \nprotection” from the “abuse” of power that could occur “should such power be concentrated in the \nexecutive branch, where one individual … determined to impose his or her policy preferences \nregardless of the will of Congress, could proceed unimpeded by the types of institutional checks \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 14 of 19 PageID #:14\npresent in the legislative body.” City of Chi. v. Barr, 961 F.3d 882, 887 (7th Cir. 2020). “Such a \nconcentration of power would allow tyranny to flourish, and our system of government is wisely \nset up by the Founders to foreclose such a danger.” Id. “The executive branch has significant \npowers of its own—particularly in matters such as immigration—but the power to wield the purse \nto alter behavior rests squarely with the legislative branch.” Id. \n60.  Congress enacted Securing the Cities and mandated that DHS provide resources to \nlocal governments, 6 U.S.C. § 596b, repeatedly appropriating funds for that purpose. \n61.  By enacting the Impoundment Control Act, Congress provided a procedure by \nwhich the Executive may propose that Congress rescind or defer funding. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 682 et \nseq. Rescissions require Congress’s approval, id. § 683(b), while deferrals are permissible in three \nnarrow circumstances and may not be made for policy reasons, id. § 684(b). President Trump has \nnot sought or obtained Congress’s approval to rescind funding under Securing the Cities, and \nDefendants have not identified any basis to defer funding under the Impoundment Control Act.  \n62.  Defendants therefore unconstitutionally usurped Congress’s authority and violated \nthe Constitution’s separation of powers by freezing funding under Securing the Cities. \nCOUNT II \nUltra Vires \n(Against All Defendants) \n63.  Chicago repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n64.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \nU.S. at 320, 326-27 (2015). The Supreme Court has repeatedly invoked this power in awarding \nequitable relief against federal officials who act “beyond th[e] limitations” imposed by federal \nstatute. Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949). \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 15 of 19 PageID #:15\n65.  Defendants acted beyond their legal authority by freezing funding under Securing \nthe Cities and violating 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). \nCOUNT III \nAdministrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n66.  Chicago repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n67.  Defendants include agencies as that term is defined in the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n68.  The APA requires that a court “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed.” Id. § 706(1). \n69.  An  agency  can  create  a  non-discretionary  duty  by  binding  itself  through  a \nregulation carrying the force of law. Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Internal Revenue Serv., 910 F.3d \n1232, 1244 (D.C. Cir. 2018). See also Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004) \n(Section 706(1) claims apply to regulations that have the force of law). \n70.  Regulations governing DHS provide: “When the reimbursement method is used, \nthe Federal agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt \nof the payment request unless the Federal agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes the \nrequest to be improper.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3); see also id. § 200.305(b)(6) (“Payments for \nallowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless required \nby Federal statute [or] regulations,” the recipient “failed to comply with the terms and conditions \nof the Federal award,” or the recipient “is delinquent in a debt to the United States.”). \n71.  DHS  has  neither  paid  Chicago  within  30  calendar  days  after  receiving \nreimbursement requests nor identified—much less have—a reasonable belief that Chicago’s \nrequests are improper. \n72.  DHS’s conduct constitutes inaction subject to review under the APA because DHS \nfailed to take a discrete agency action required by 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 16 of 19 PageID #:16\nCOUNT IV \nAdministrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n73.  Chicago repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n74.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n75.  Defendants’ freeze of Securing the Cities funding is final agency action. See, e.g., \nMe. v. United States Dep’t of Agric., 2025 WL 1088946, at *20 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2025); N.Y. v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 715621, at *9 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Office of \nMgmt. & Budget, 2025 WL 597959, at *13 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025). \n76.  An  agency  action  is  arbitrary  or  capricious  where  it  is  not  “reasonable  and \nreasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). An agency \nmust provide “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (cleaned up). The “reasoned explanation requirement of administrative \nlaw … is meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons \nthat can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. N.Y., 588 U.S. \n752, 785 (2019). \n77.  Defendants have offered no explanation for freezing Securing the Cities funding, \nmuch less a reasonable explanation. \n78.  Defendants have failed to identify, let alone explain, any “reasonabl[e] belie[f]” \nthat they may have for failing to reimburse Chicago within 30 days of receiving payment requests. \n2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). \n79.  Defendants asserted that they “pause[d]” the use of Securing the Cities funds to buy \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 17 of 19 PageID #:17\n“radiological nuclear detection equipment and supplies” based on “Federal funding constraints.” \nDefendants cited no authority permitting this action, which violates congressional appropriations \nlaws and 2 C.F.R. § 200.305. \n80.  An action is also arbitrary and capricious if the agency “‘failed to consider … \nimportant aspects of the problem’” before it. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., \n591 U.S. 1, 25 (2020). Where “an agency changes course ... it must ‘be cognizant that longstanding \npolicies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.”’ Id. \nDefendants exhibited no consideration of Chicago’s reliance interests in refusing to reimburse the \nCity for expenditures that Defendants approved. \nCOUNT V \nAdministrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)-(C) \n81.  Chicago repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n82.  Courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions \nfound to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” or “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)-\n(C). \n83.  Federal agencies must “manage and administer the Federal award in a manner so \nas to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full \naccordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations ... and the \nrequirements of this part.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a). \n84.  For the  reasons described above,  Defendants violated “the U.S. Constitution, \napplicable Federal statutes and regulations” by freezing Securing the Cities funding and failing to \ncomply with 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). \n \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/16/25 Page 18 of 19 PageID #:18\nCOUNT VI \nAdministrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D) \n85.  Chicago repeats and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n86.  Courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings and conclusions \nfound to be … without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n87.  DHS’s inaction on Chicago’s reimbursement requests violates procedures set forth \nin 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nThe City requests that the Court: \ni.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, issue a declaration that Defendants violated the Constitution, \nthe APA, and acted ultra vires by freezing Securing the Cities funding and failing to resolve \nreimbursement requests within 30 days; \nii.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  Defendants  from  freezing  Securing  the  Cities \nfunding and failing to resolve pending and future reimbursement requests in accordance \nwith 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3); \niii.

Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed, a law establishing Securing \nthe Cities. Congress explained that Securing the Cities seeks to prevent nuclear and other terrorist \nattacks in high-risk urban areas. To accomplish this purpose, Congress mandated that DHS \nimplement Securing the Cities by providing resources to local governments. \n2.  Pursuant to this mandate, DHS has for years entered into cooperative agreements \nthat award funds to 13 local governments—including Plaintiffs—in urban regions that DHS deems \nto be at an elevated risk of sustaining terrorist attacks. The cooperative agreements expressly \nidentify ways in which local governments may spend Securing the Cities funds and require DHS’s \n  1 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 2 of 26 PageID #:45\npre-approval before incurring other costs. \n3.  For example, Plaintiffs have used Securing the Cities funds to buy, and train \nemployees to use, equipment designed to detect nuclear and other radiological materials that could \nbe used to commit terrorist attacks. Plaintiffs employ the equipment and personnel funded by \nSecuring the Cities to conduct security sweeps at athletic events, concerts, parades, political rallies, \nand the like. For instance, Plaintiffs used Securing the Cities funds to protect public safety during \na visit by then-President Joe Biden, a rally held by then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump, and \nat the 2024 Democratic and Republican National Conventions. Plaintiffs similarly intend to use \nSecuring the Cities funds to protect upcoming events such as the 2026 Super Bowl in San Francisco \nand the FIFA World Cup 26 in Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle. \n4.  After incurring these and other costs, Plaintiffs periodically seek reimbursement \nfrom DHS. Until recently, DHS typically reimbursed Plaintiffs within 72 hours of receiving the \nrequest. \n5.  All  that  changed  in  recent  months.  Since  February  21,  2025,  Plaintiffs  have \nsubmitted 11 requests to reimburse Plaintiffs for expenditures that DHS had already approved. \nDHS has effectively ignored Plaintiffs’ requests while holding open the possibility that DHS may \nsomeday reimburse Plaintiffs. For example, on May 28, 2025, DHS stated that it would reimburse \nChicago that day, but only if Chicago resubmitted previously provided information about its five \nreimbursement requests within ten minutes. Although Chicago provided the requested information \nthat same day, DHS has not reimbursed Chicago as of the date of this filing. \n6.  On information and belief, DHS’s inaction is part of a programmatic freeze of \nSecuring the Cities funding. In response to Chicago’s many inquiries about its reimbursement \nrequests, a federal employee explained that Chicago’s requests were “approved,” but that “[a]ll \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 3 of 26 PageID #:46\nDHS-OPO [Office of Procurement  Operations] payments are on pause.” A DHS employee \nsimilarly told San Francisco that “there is a ‘pause’ on disbursements,” and that “I have no \ninformation on when you can expect the payment.” \n7.  On May 14, 2025, DHS notified Securing the Cities regions that they “must pause \n…  all  radiological  and  nuclear  detection  equipment  purchases”  due  to  supposed  “funding \nconstraints.” That notice, in conjunction with DHS’s failure to reimburse Plaintiffs for approved \nexpenditures, has already impaired public safety. Plaintiffs have told vendors to stop work on vital \nequipment and have canceled training designed to protect against terrorist attacks. \n8.  To make matters worse, DHS has not provided new awards to Plaintiffs in 2025, as \nthe  agency  did  each  year  since  entering  into  cooperative  agreements  with  Plaintiffs.  On \ninformation  and  belief,  absent  new  awards  or  extensions  of  the  budget  periods  governing \nPlaintiffs’ current awards, DHS will not reimburse Plaintiffs for costs incurred after their budget \nperiods expire. Because Plaintiffs’ budget periods expire as early as June 30, 2025, DHS’s inaction \nmay soon force Plaintiffs to abandon their Securing the Cities programs altogether. \n9.  DHS’s funding freeze is unconstitutional. The United States Constitution assigns \nCongress the responsibility to enact laws and appropriate funds, while requiring the executive \nbranch to execute those laws. Congress enacted Securing the Cities and required DHS to provide \nresources to local governments to implement the program. DHS cannot override Congress’s \njudgment by freezing congressionally appropriated funding. \n10.  DHS’s funding freeze also violates the Administrative Procedure Act. Governing \nregulations require federal agencies to reimburse funding recipients “within 30 calendar days after \nreceipt of the payment request unless the Federal agency [] reasonably believes the request to be \nimproper.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). DHS has neither reimbursed Plaintiffs within 30 days of \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 4 of 26 PageID #:47\nreceiving reimbursement requests nor so much as suggested that there is anything “improper” \nabout  Plaintiffs’  requests.  On  the  contrary,  the  federal  government  told  Chicago  that  its \nreimbursement requests were “approved,” but that “[a]ll” such requests are “paused.” \n11.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an order enjoining Defendants from freezing Securing \nthe Cities funding and requiring that Defendants process pending and future reimbursement \nrequests pursuant to law. \nPARTIES \n12.

Congress Established, and Directed DHS to Implement, Securing the Cities. \n \n21.  In the wake of the September 11th attacks, Congress created DHS and tasked the \nagency with reducing the United States’ vulnerability to terrorism. \n22.  In 2005, President George W. Bush directed DHS to “establish a national level \nDomestic Nuclear Detection Office.” According to the President, the Domestic Nuclear Detection \nOffice would “[s]erve as the primary entity in the United States Government to further develop, \nacquire, and support the deployment of an enhanced domestic system to detect and report on \nattempts to import, possess, store, transport, develop, or use an unauthorized nuclear explosive \ndevice, fissile material, or radiological material in the United States, and improve that system over \ntime.”1 Congress later established the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in statute. See 6 U.S.C. \n§§ 591-596A. \n23.  In 2007, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office created a pilot initiative called \n“Securing the Cities” to help the highest-risk U.S. cities detect nuclear and radiological materials \nas well as respond to terrorist attacks. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office selected the New \n \n1 National Security Presidential Directive Nspd-43 (Apr. 15, 2005), https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nspd/nspd-\n43.html. \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 6 of 26 PageID #:49\nYork City/Jersey City/Newark region as the first pilot region for Securing the Cities.2 \n24.  Between  2012  and  2017,  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office  added  the \nChicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC regions to Securing the Cities because the \nOffice deemed them to be “high-risk” areas. The Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Maricopa County, \nMiami, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Seattle regions were later added to Securing the Cities.3 \n25.  In 2018, Congress passed—and President Trump signed—the Countering Weapons \nof Mass Destruction Act. That Act required DHS to “establish” Securing the Cities “to enhance \nthe ability of the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high-consequence \nevents utilizing nuclear or other radiological materials that pose a high risk to homeland security \nin high-risk urban areas.” 6 U.S.C. § 596b. Through Securing the Cities, DHS “shall—provide \nresources to enhance detection, analysis, communication, and coordination to better integrate \nState, local, Tribal, and territorial assets into Federal operations … [and] provide augmenting \nresources, as appropriate, to enable State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to sustain and \nrefresh their capabilities developed under the STC program.” Id. § 596b(b)(3) & (6). \n26.  The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act renamed the Domestic Nuclear \nDetection Office as the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which is “responsible \nfor coordinating Federal efforts and developing a strategy and policy for the Department to plan \nfor, detect, and protect against the importation, possession, storage, transportation, development, \nor use of unauthorized chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear materials, devices, or agents \nin the United States and to protect against an attack using such materials, devices, or agents against \n \n2 United States Department of Homeland Security, Securing the Cities Implementation Plan for Fiscal Year \n2022 at 2  (Nov. 4, 2022) (“2022 STC Plan”), www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/CWMD%20-\n%20Securing%20the%20Cities%20implementation%20Plan.pdf. \n3  Id.;  United  States  Government  Accountability  Office,  Nuclear  Terrorism Prevention:  DHS  Has \nStrengthened  the Securing the Cities Program,  but  Actions  Are  Needed  to  Address  Key  Remaining \nChallenges at 1-2 (Mar. 2024) (“GAO Report”), www.gao.gov/assets/870/867470.pdf. \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 7 of 26 PageID #:50\nthe people, territory, or interests of the United States.” Id. § 591g. \n27.  Congress  has  annually  appropriated  funds  “[f]or  necessary  expenses  of  the \nCountering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office for Federal assistance through grants, contracts, \ncooperative agreements, and other activities.” Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. \n116-260, 134 Stat. 1182; accord, e.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. \n118-47, 138 Stat. 613. \n28.  Congress has consistently supported Securing the Cities on a bipartisan basis. As \nrecently as March 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed on a voice vote the Securing \nthe Cities Improvement Act, which seeks to strengthen the program in response to the New Orleans \nBourbon Street attack in January 2025. See H.R. 1374, 119th Cong. (2025); see also 171 Cong. \nRec. H1056-57 (Mar. 10, 2025) (statements of Reps. Correa and Green). \n29.  There is good reason for this bipartisan consensus. As the U.S. Government \nAccountability Office explained in a report about Securing the Cities, “[t]he U.S. faces an enduring \nthreat that terrorists could steal or smuggle nuclear or radiological materials to use in a terrorist \nattack, and efforts to counter such threats are considered a top national priority.” The goal of \nSecuring the Cities “is to enhance the ability of the U.S. to detect and prevent the malevolent use \nof nuclear and radioactive materials that pose risks to high-risk urban areas.”4 \n30.  DHS, now acting though the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, has \nimplemented  Congress’s  directives  by  entering  into  “cooperative  agreements”  with  local \ngovernments in each Securing the Cities region. Unlike grants, cooperative agreements are used \nwhen  the  federal  agency  will  be  “substantial[ly]  involve[d]”  in  “carrying  out  the  activity \ncontemplated in the agreement.” 31 U.S.C. § 6305. Compare id. § 6304 (grants). \n \n4 GAO Report, supra, at 1-2. \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 8 of 26 PageID #:51\n31.  Under these cooperative agreements, a local governmental agency in each Securing \nthe Cities region is responsible for managing the regional program, coordinating with other state \nand local governmental agencies, and reporting that region’s progress to DHS.5 \n32.  Cooperative  agreements  under  Securing  the  Cities  provide  funding  on  a \nreimbursement basis. In other words, funding recipients (a) incur costs that are either expressly \npermitted in cooperative agreements or that DHS pre-approves on an individualized basis and then \n(b) request reimbursement for those costs. \n33.  Since approximately 2020, DHS has entered into Securing the Cities cooperative \nagreements that provide for a ten-year period of performance (i.e., the period during which the \nlocal government may expend approved funds to complete the work). According to the U.S. \nGovernment Accountability Office, Securing the Cities regions may be unable to “maintain and \nsustain capabilities over time without a dedicated source of [long-term] federal funding,” instead \nforced to “delay[]” critical work to focus on “short-term efforts.”6 \nII.  Plaintiffs Entered into Cooperatives Agreements with DHS. \n \n34.  In 2015, DHS selected Chicago as a Securing the Cities region based on DHS’s \ndetermination that Chicago is at a “high risk” of sustaining a terrorist attack. \n35.  In 2016, DHS entered into a cooperative agreement with Chicago, acting through \nthe City’s Fire Department. \n36.  The 2016 award letter obligated DHS to pay $3.5 million in Securing the Cities \nfunds to Chicago, with a period of performance from 2016 to 2021. \n37.  DHS stated that the 2016 award “will enable the City of Chicago, Fire Department \nto provide regional partners radiological and nuclear detection capabilities to reduce risk along \n \n5 2022 STC Plan, supra, at 2. \n6 GAO Report, supra, at 15-16. \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 9 of 26 PageID #:52\nroadway, light and heavy rail, and maritime pathways.” DHS also stated that the award “will \nprovide assistance that will allow regional partners to acquire equipment, training, and support to \nfurther the radiological and nuclear detection mission in the Chicago Region.” \n38.  DHS celebrated the 2016 award, issuing a press release stating that the agency was \n“building on [its] ongoing efforts to increase the Nation’s capabilities to detect and protect against \nradiological and nuclear threats.” \n39.  From 2017 through 2020, DHS sent several “please apply” letters asking the \nChicago Fire Department to apply “[t]o facilitate continuation funding” under the 2016 award. \nChicago applied for and received an additional $16,575,000 for the same period of performance \nfrom 2016 to 2021. \n40.  In 2019 and 2020, DHS added the Boston, Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle \nregions to Securing the Cities based on DHS’s determination that those regions are at a “high risk” \nof sustaining terrorist attacks. DHS sent Notices of Funding Opportunity inviting Boston, Denver, \nSan Francisco, and Seattle to apply for Securing the Cities funding.  \n41.  DHS also sent a Notice of Funding Opportunity to the Chicago Fire Department in \n2020, proposing to continue providing Securing the Cities funding to Chicago under a new \ncooperative agreement. \n42.  The Notices of Funding Opportunity explained that Securing the Cities seeks to \n“further the nuclear detection mission in the region” and “[a]chieve better integration of Federal, \nState, and local capabilities allowing regional support to national operations.” \n43.  The Notices of Funding Opportunity (a) listed equipment that recipients could buy \nand training that recipients could provide using Securing the Cities funds and (b) required \nrecipients to obtain “prior approval of DHS” to procure other equipment or provide other services. \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 10 of 26 PageID #:53\n44.  Plaintiffs each applied for Securing the Cities funding by providing proposed \nbudgets, project plans, financials, and other information required by DHS. \n45.  In 2020 and 2021, DHS entered into cooperative agreements with Plaintiffs under \nwhich DHS awarded Securing the Cities funds. The cooperative agreements provide for periods \nof performance from 2020 or 2021 through 2029 or 2030. \n46.  Plaintiffs in turn have entered into memoranda of understanding with regional \npartners to implement Securing the Cities. For example, San Francisco has entered memoranda of \nunderstanding with fourteen California counties, one Nevada county, and two other Bay Area cities \n(San José and Oakland). The Chicago Fire Department has similarly entered into memoranda of \nunderstanding with its principal partners in the Chicago region, including the Cook County \nSherriff’s Office, the Illinois State Police, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. \n47.  Following execution of the 2020/2021 cooperative agreements, DHS annually sent \n“please apply” letters inviting Plaintiffs to apply for additional funding. After Plaintiffs submitted \nthe requested applications, DHS awarded additional money to Plaintiffs for the same periods of \nperformance. \n48.  All told, DHS has awarded nearly $25 million in congressionally appropriated \nfunds to Plaintiffs under the 2020/2021 cooperative agreements. \n49.  Plaintiffs have implemented Securing the Cities by, among other actions: \na.  buying equipment to detect nuclear and radiological materials, including to \nenhance detection systems across transportation routes leading to urban areas; \nb.  creating  and  implementing  programs  that  train  employees  to  use  this \nequipment and respond to terrorist attacks; \nc.  paying the salaries of employees responsible for managing the program; and \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 11 of 26 PageID #:54\nd.  developing plans for regional partners to prepare for, and respond to, \nnuclear and/or radiological threats in the region. \n50.  Plaintiffs use equipment and personnel funded by Securing the Cities to conduct \nsecurity sweeps and otherwise monitor critical infrastructure as well as special events such as \nconcerts, dignitary visits, elections, festivals, parades, political rallies, and professional sporting \nevents. For example, Plaintiffs have used Securing the Cities funds in connection with: \na.  the  2024  Democratic  National  Convention  in  Chicago  and  the  2024 \nRepublican National Convention in Milwaukee; \nb.  then-President Biden’s visit to Denver in November 2023; \nc.  a rally held in October 2024 by then-candidate Trump in Aurora, Colorado; \nd.  the 2024 Presidential election; \ne.  a conference held by the Jewish National Fund in December 2023; \nf.  the Boston Marathon—including on the ten-year anniversary of the 2013 \nbombing; \ng.  Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football \nLeague, and National Hockey League games as well as parades celebrating NBA and NHL \nchampions; \nh.  Gay Pride parades; and \ni.  concerts held at Red Rocks as well as by the Boston Pops as part of July 4th \ncelebrations. \n51.  Since their inclusion in Securing the Cities, Plaintiffs have periodically submitted \nreimbursement requests for these and other pre-approved expenditures. Until recently, DHS \ntypically reimbursed Plaintiffs within 72 hours of receiving the request. \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 12 of 26 PageID #:55\nIII.  DHS Froze Securing the Cities Funding. \n52.  Since February 21, 2025, Plaintiffs have submitted 11 requests for reimbursement \nunder Securing the Cities for a total of nearly $3 million. \n53.  Through these 11 requests, Plaintiffs seek reimbursement for money that they have \nspent on detection equipment, payroll, and other products or services that are either expressly \nauthorized by the cooperative agreements or that DHS pre-approved. \n54.  DHS has not acted on any of these 11 reimbursement requests. \n55.  Federal regulations provide that where, as here, “the reimbursement method is used, \nthe Federal agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt \nof the payment request unless the Federal agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes the \nrequest to be improper.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3); see also id. § 200.305(b)(6) (“Payments for \nallowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless required \nby Federal statute [or] regulations,” the recipient “failed to comply with the terms and conditions \nof the Federal award,” or the recipient “is delinquent in a debt to the United States.”). \n56.  Ten  of  the  eleven  reimbursement  requests  submitted  by  Plaintiffs  since         \nFebruary 21 have been pending for more than 30 days, with some pending for nearly four months. \nThe eleventh request will become 30 days old on June 18, 2025. \n57.  On March 3, 2025, Chicago requested a status update on the City’s February 21 \nreimbursement requests from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services employee Vivian \nHughes, who assists Chicago with drawdown requests made through the federal government’s \nPayment Management Services system. Hughes responded: “All DHS-OPO payments are on \npause. The payment has been approved but not yet release[d] for payment. We must await guidance \nfrom DHS ….” Hughes instructed Chicago to “contact your grant officer directly.” \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 13 of 26 PageID #:56\n58.  On March 4 and March 11, 2025, Chicago emailed its DHS grant officer about the \nCity’s pending reimbursement requests. The grant officer did not respond. \n59.  On March 19, 2025, Chicago emailed Vivian Hughes again to inquire when DHS \nanticipated reimbursing Chicago. Hughes responded: “The payment has been approved but not yet \nrelease[d] for payment. We must await guidance from DHS … If you have any questions, contact \nyour grants officer directly.” \n60.  The same day, Chicago emailed another DHS grant officer to request an update \nabout the City’s pending reimbursement requests. The grant officer responded: “I am sorry to say, \nI have no further information on your question. We are awaiting guidance on this issue. As soon \nas we have information to provide, we will do so.” \n61.  On April 10, 2025, Chicago wrote a letter to DHS demanding that the agency \nreimburse the City for its Securing the Cities expenditures within 10 days. DHS neither responded \nto Chicago’s letter nor resolved Chicago’s pending reimbursement requests. \n62.  On April 29, 2025, DHS emailed San Francisco: “Due to current events, there is a \n‘pause’ on disbursements from the federal government’s Payment Management Service. All of our \ngrants are subject to this ‘pause,’ and there is no additional information you need to provide at this \ntime.  I have no information on when you can expect the payment to be approved as we are awaiting \nguidance. Once we have information to share, we will do so.” \n63.  Neither Defendants nor any other federal agency or employee have told Plaintiffs \nthe legal basis for freezing Securing the Cities funding. \n64.  On May 14, 2025, DHS notified all Securing the Cities regions that “the STC \nprogram must pause … all radiological nuclear detection equipment and supplies purchases,” \nciting supposed “Federal funding constraints.” This notification is part of DHS’s funding freeze. \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 14 of 26 PageID #:57\n65.  On May 28, 2025—tellingly, after Chicago filed the original complaint initiating \nthis lawsuit—DHS informed Chicago that it would reimburse Chicago that day. But DHS agreed \nto  do  so  only  if  Chicago  provided  a  breakdown  of  the  costs  for  which  Chicago  sought \nreimbursement in its five outstanding requests—the oldest of which has been pending for four \nmonths—within ten minutes. Chicago had previously given DHS the information that the agency \nrequested. Chicago nevertheless gave DHS the information again on May 28, albeit not within ten \nminutes. DHS has not reimbursed Chicago as of the date of this filing. \n66.  DHS’s freeze on Securing the Cities funding and equipment purchases may be \nexplained by uncertainty about the Office’s future. Press reports indicate that the Department of \nGovernment Efficiency has marked the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office for \ntermination.7 DHS’s proposed 2026 budget seeks to eliminate the Countering Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Office and divide its functions among various DHS entities.8 \n67.  Adding to the uncertainty surrounding Securing the Cities’ future, DHS has not sent \n“please apply” letters to Plaintiffs in 2025—letters that DHS has distributed to Plaintiffs each year \nsince the 2020/2021 cooperative agreements, for some Plaintiffs typically in April or May. “Please \napply” letters are a precursor to DHS allocating new funding appropriated by Congress to Plaintiffs \nand, for reasons explained below, may be required for Plaintiffs to retain access to unspent funds. \n68.  A former head of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office stated that \ndismantling the Office “would increase the likelihood of a successful attack” and leave cities \nhosting events like the World Cup and Summer Olympics “scrambling to find the tools, expertise \n \n7 Josh Marshall, DOGE Poised to Nix WMD Office at DHS, TALKING POINTS MEMO, Apr. 8, 2025, \ntalkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/doge-poised-to-nix-wmd-office-at-dhs;  see  also  Justin  Ling,  Pentagon \nCuts Threaten Programs That Secure Losse Nukes and Weapons of Mass Destruction, WIRED, Mar. 6, \n2025, www.wired.com/story/pentagon-cuts-nukes-chemical-weapons-wmd. \n8 Justin Doubleday, DHS budget request would split up CWMD office, FEDERAL NEWS NETWORK, June 2, \n2025, federalnewsnetwork.com/budget/2025/06/dhs-budget-request-would-split-up-cwmd-office. \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 15 of 26 PageID #:58\nand personnel needed to guard against weapons of mass destruction threats.”9 \n69.  It is unclear who is even leading the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction \nOffice now. The Trump Administration recently fired Acting FEMA Administrator Cameron \nHamilton and replaced him with David Richardson—who had been, and perhaps still is, the head \nof the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.10 \nIV.  DHS’s Funding Freeze Is Harming Public Safety. \n70.  Even if DHS satisfies Plaintiffs’ pending reimbursement requests, Plaintiffs have \nmore than $15 million in Securing the Cities funding that Plaintiffs may use through 2029 or 2030, \nin addition to funding that Congress appropriates in the future. \n71.  Plaintiffs thus continue to incur costs implementing Securing the Cities and intend \nto seek reimbursement for those costs in the future. \n72.  For example, Seattle is hosting the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025 and the FIFA \nWorld Cup in 2026, games that will be attended by hundreds of thousands of people from around \nthe world. In preparation, the Seattle Fire and Police Departments are currently engaged in training  \naimed  at  detecting  radioactive  threats  and  preventing  terrorist  attacks.  The  equipment  and \npersonnel for this training are funded through Securing the Cities. \n73.  DHS’s funding freeze is, however, already impairing Plaintiffs’ ability to protect \npublic safety. \n74.  Boston halted several projects because of DHS’s funding freeze and May 14 email: \na.  Boston told a vendor to continue construction on a Massachusetts State \n \n9 Mary Ellen Callahan, The Consequences of eliminating the DHS WMD office could be catastrophic, THE \nHILL, Apr. 11, 2025, thehill.com/opinion/national-security/5242861-threats-homeland-security-weapons-\nmass-destruction. \n10 Nicole Sganga, FEMA leader fired after breaking with Trump administration on eliminating agency, \nCBS  NEWS,  May  9,  2025,  www.cbsnews.com/news/fema-leader-fired-trump-administration-cameron-\nhamilton. \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 16 of 26 PageID #:59\nPolice vessel for maritime operations without installing radiation detection equipment \nbecause Boston otherwise lacks funding to buy the radiation detection equipment needed \nfor the vessel; \nb.  Boston delayed aerial training designed to help the Massachusetts State \nPolice Air Wing and Bomb Squad prevent terrorist attacks; and \nc.  Boston delayed buying crucial nuclear and radiological detection equipment \nfor its Fire Department. \n75.  As a result of DHS’s funding freeze and May 14 email, Chicago deferred renewing \na license for software used to operate radiation detection devices and instructed a vendor to stop \nwork on a camera system used to detect radiation sources. Chicago also instructed a vendor to stop \nwork on an April 2025 request for built-to-order personal radiation detectors, but the vendor \nresponded that Chicago’s customized order was too far along to cancel. \n76.  As a result of DHS’s funding freeze and the May 14 email, Denver has paused all \nSecuring the Cities expenditures except staff time. Consequently, Denver: \na.  canceled scheduled training to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks and \nis rejecting requests from regional partners to schedule new training events; \nb.  cannot repair broken equipment designed to detect nuclear and radiological \nmaterials; \nc.  cannot install a $263,000 mobile-security unit designed to monitor events \nfor risks to public safety, leaving the unit in storage when it needs to be in the field; and \nd.  cannot pay the vendor that provides software for a system that Denver uses \nto manage and track nuclear and radiological detection equipment, forcing Denver to \nmanually maintain records in Excel spreadsheets. \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 17 of 26 PageID #:60\n77.  As a result of DHS’s funding freeze and the May 14 email, San Francisco has: \na.  paused the procurement process for mobile radiation detectors designed to \nidentify unauthorized radiological material that could severely harm the public; \nb.  canceled  and  rescheduled  training  on  the  use  of  specialized  detection \nequipment; and \nc.  rejected requests by partner agencies to expand the region’s Securing the \nCities program. \n78.  In March 2025, DHS approved the Seattle Police Department’s request to use \nSecuring the Cities funds to buy 1,000 state-of-the-art personal radiation detectors at a cost \nexceeding $1.1 million. The Seattle Police Department then initiated procurement procedures to \nbuy the detectors, which the Department intended to use to prevent terrorist attacks at the World \nCup events described above as well as other large events. As a result of DHS’s funding freeze and \nMay 14 email, however, the Seattle Police Department was forced to pause the purchases. \n79.  To make matters worse, the current budget periods for Plaintiffs’ cooperative \nagreements are approaching their end dates, with some expiring as soon as June 30, 2025. Although \nPlaintiffs’ cooperative agreements provide for a period of performance through 2029 or 2030, DHS \nhas taken the position that recipients of Securing the Cities funding must obtain DHS’s permission \nto carry over unspent funds allocated in prior years. Thus, to comply with DHS’s position and \nretain access to unspent funds allocated in prior years, Plaintiffs must either obtain an extension \nof the current budget period or a new annual award under the cooperative agreements. \n80.  In May 2025, Seattle asked DHS whether it intended to send the city a “please \napply” letter, which is a precursor to obtaining a new annual award. DHS responded that it was \nnot offering new awards at that time. DHS stated, however, that it would extend Seattle’s current \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 18 of 26 PageID #:61\nbudget period beyond June 30 if requested. Seattle then requested an extension, only for DHS to \nsay that it needed more clarity about the agency’s budget before responding. On June 3, Seattle \nagain asked DHS to extend the current budget period past June 30. DHS responded that it could \nnot resolve Seattle’s request and did not know when it could do so. \n81.  Finally, on June 12, 2025, DHS sent “please apply” letters to three Securing the \nCities regions, including San Francisco and Seattle. The letters state: “For FY’25, your award \nauthorization will consist of carryover funding ONLY.” (Emphasis in original) The letters also \nstate that the May 14 email “remains in effect for the upcoming budget period and no R/N \n[radiological/nuclear] Detection Equipment maybe [sic] purchased after that date and until the \npause is lifted, therefore no funds should be budgeted in the Equipment Category.” The letters \ndemand that recipients apply by June 20, 2025, a highly compressed timeframe relative to prior \nyears. \n82.  San Francisco and Seattle plan to apply for the limited carryover funding, but \nPlaintiffs do not agree to the limitations arbitrarily and unlawfully placed on the funding or any \nunlawful terms and conditions attached to it. Nor do Plaintiffs agree that the limited funding made \navailable through this award application is sufficient to fulfill Securing the Cities program \nrequirements and goals. \n83.  On information and belief, absent an extension or a new annual award, DHS will \nnot reimburse Plaintiffs for costs incurred after their current budget periods expire. DHS’s inaction \nthus may force Plaintiffs to abandon their participation in Securing the Cities. \n84.  On June 12, 2025, DHS also emailed all Securing the Cities regions to request “the \ndate when you will run out of funds for PMO [Project Management Office] salaries with your \ncurrent funding. When calculating the date please keep in mind the pause on equipment purchases \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 19 of 26 PageID #:62\nand the funding should carry the PMO until the FY26 award cycle.” This confirms that DHS \nintends to maintain the May 14 email’s “pause” on equipment purchases into 2026. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nSeparation of Powers \n85.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n86.  The Constitution provides that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States.” U.S. CONST. art. I, § 1. “There is no provision in the \nConstitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” Clinton v. City \nof N.Y., 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998). \n87.  Instead, the President must “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. \nCONST. art. II, § 3; see Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 327 (2014) (“Congress makes the \nlaws and the President, sometimes acting through agencies … ‘faithfully execute[s]’ them”). The \nExecutive  Branch  violates  the  Take  Care  Clause  when  it  declines  to  execute  or  otherwise \nundermines statutes enacted by Congress or regulations implementing statutes. See In re United \nMine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 F.3d 545, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“the President is without \nauthority to set aside congressional legislation by executive order”); Kendall v. United States, 37 \nU.S. 524, 613 (1838) (rejecting argument that by charging the President with faithful execution of \nthe laws, the Take Care clause “implies a power to forbid their execution”). \n88.  Moreover, the Constitution “grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \nPresident.” City & Cnty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018); see U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause). \n89.  The Constitution’s delegation of authority to Congress “provides institutional \nprotection” from the “abuse” of power that could occur “should such power be concentrated in the \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 20 of 26 PageID #:63\nexecutive branch, where one individual … determined to impose his or her policy preferences \nregardless of the will of Congress, could proceed unimpeded by the types of institutional checks \npresent in the legislative body.” City of Chi. v. Barr, 961 F.3d 882, 887 (7th Cir. 2020). “Such a \nconcentration of power would allow tyranny to flourish, and our system of government is wisely \nset up by the Founders to foreclose such a danger.” Id. “The executive branch has significant \npowers of its own—particularly in matters such as immigration—but the power to wield the purse \nto alter behavior rests squarely with the legislative branch.” Id. \n90.  Congress enacted Securing the Cities and mandated that DHS provide resources to \nlocal governments, 6 U.S.C. § 596b, repeatedly appropriating funds for that purpose. \n91.  By enacting the Impoundment Control Act, Congress provided a procedure by \nwhich the Executive may propose that Congress rescind or defer funding. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 682 et \nseq. Rescissions require Congress’s approval, id. § 683(b), while deferrals are permissible in three \nnarrow circumstances and may not be made for policy reasons, id. § 684(b). President Trump has \nnot sought or obtained Congress’s approval to rescind funding under Securing the Cities, and \nDefendants have not identified any basis to defer funding under the Impoundment Control Act.  \n92.  Defendants therefore unconstitutionally usurped Congress’s authority and violated \nthe Constitution’s separation of powers by freezing funding under Securing the Cities. \nCOUNT II \nUltra Vires \n(Against All Defendants) \n93.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n94.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \nU.S. at 320, 326-27 (2015). The Supreme Court has repeatedly invoked this power in awarding \n  20 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 21 of 26 PageID #:64\nequitable relief against federal officials who act “beyond th[e] limitations” imposed by federal \nstatute. Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949). \n95.  Defendants acted beyond their legal authority by freezing funding under Securing \nthe Cities and violating 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). \nCOUNT III \nAdministrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n96.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n97.  Defendants include agencies as that term is defined in the Administrative Procedure \nAct. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n98.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires that a court “compel agency action \nunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” Id. § 706(1). \n99.  An  agency  can  create  a  non-discretionary  duty  by  binding  itself  through  a \nregulation carrying the force of law. Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Internal Revenue Serv., 910 F.3d \n1232, 1244 (D.C. Cir. 2018); see also Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004) \n(Section 706(1) claims apply to regulations that have the force of law). \n100.  DHS has violated 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3) by neither paying Plaintiffs within 30 \ncalendar days after receiving reimbursement requests nor identifying—much less having—a \nreasonable belief that Plaintiffs’ requests are improper. \n101.  DHS’s conduct constitutes inaction subject to review under the Administrative \nProcedure Act because DHS failed to take a discrete agency action required by 2 C.F.R. § \n200.305(b)(3). \nCOUNT IV \nAdministrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n102.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n103.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside \n  21 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 22 of 26 PageID #:65\nagency  action,  findings,  and  conclusions  found  to  be  …  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n104.  Defendants’ freeze of Securing the Cities funding is final agency action. See, e.g., \nMe. v. United States Dep’t of Agric., 2025 WL 1088946, at *20 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2025); N.Y. v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 715621, at *9 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Office of \nMgmt. & Budget, 2025 WL 597959, at *13 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025). \n105.  An  agency  action  is  arbitrary  or  capricious  where  it  is  not  “reasonable  and \nreasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). An agency \nmust provide “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (cleaned up). The “reasoned explanation requirement of administrative \nlaw … is meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons \nthat can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. N.Y., 588 U.S. \n752, 785 (2019). \n106.  Defendants have offered no explanation for freezing Securing the Cities funding, \nmuch less a reasonable explanation. \n107.  Defendants have failed to identify, let alone explain, any “reasonabl[e] belie[f]” \nthat they may have for failing to reimburse Plaintiffs within 30 days of receiving requests. 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(3). \n108.  Defendants asserted that they “pause[d]” the use of Securing the Cities funds to buy \n“radiological nuclear detection equipment and supplies” based on “Federal funding constraints.” \nDefendants cited no authority permitting this action, which violates congressional appropriations \nlaws and 2 C.F.R. § 200.305. \n  22 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 23 of 26 PageID #:66\n109.  An action is also arbitrary and capricious if the agency “‘failed to consider … \nimportant aspects of the problem’” before it. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., \n591 U.S. 1, 25 (2020). Where “an agency changes course ... it must ‘be cognizant that longstanding \npolicies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.”’ Id. \nDefendants exhibited no consideration of Plaintiffs’ reliance interests in refusing to reimburse \nPlaintiffs for expenditures that Defendants approved. \nCOUNT V \nAdministrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)-(C) \n110.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n111.  Courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions \nfound to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” or “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B)-\n(C). \n112.  Federal agencies must “manage and administer the Federal award in a manner so \nas to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full \naccordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations ... and the \nrequirements of this part.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.300(a). \n113.  For the  reasons described above,  Defendants violated “the U.S. Constitution, \napplicable Federal statutes and regulations” by freezing Securing the Cities funding. \nCOUNT VI \nAdministrative Procedure Act—5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D) \n114.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n115.  Courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings and conclusions \nfound to be … without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n116.  DHS’s inaction on Plaintiffs’ reimbursement requests violates procedures set forth \n  23 \n\nCase: 1:25-cv-05462 Document #: 10 Filed: 06/16/25 Page 24 of 26 PageID #:67\nin 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs request that the Court: \ni.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, issue a declaration that Defendants violated the Constitution, \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, and acted ultra vires by freezing Securing the Cities \nfunding and failing to resolve reimbursement requests within 30 days; \nii.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  Defendants  from  freezing  Securing  the  Cities \nfunding and failing to resolve pending and future reimbursement requests in accordance \nwith 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(3); \niii.  Award attorney’s fees and costs to Plaintiffs; and \niv.  Grant any other relief that the Court deems proper. \n \nDated: June 16, 2025     Respectfully submitted, \nMary B.
