You can see all of the cases <a href=\"../../../../case/46411/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On May 17, 2025, a Venezuelan noncitizen detained in the Central District of California brought this habeas and civil lawsuit as a proposed class action. The petition-complaint names President Donald Trump, the Attorney General, the U.S. Department of Defense and its Secretary, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary, the U.S. Department of State and its Secretary, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its Acting Director and LA Director, and other ICE officials as Defendants. The case challenged both ICE's notice practices for noncitizens facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act, and the underlying question of the legitimate application of the Act. The case was assigned to District Judge John W. Holcomb.</p>\r\n<p>On May 19, 2025, Judge Holcomb issued a class wide preliminary injunction - issued ex parte - prohibiting the government from removing any putative class members from the Central District of California pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, pending a hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, Judge Holcomb rejected government arguments challenging jurisdiction and standing, extended the preliminary injunction, and certified the class. 2025 WL 2019798. Judge Holcomb found that petitioner was unlikely to succeed on his challenge to the Alien Enemies Act because the act granted \"close to unlimited\" power to the President to determine the applicability of the act. The court held it inappropriate for courts to construe the terms of the AEA because doing so inappropriately reflects the court's \"own determinations.\"&nbsp; In contrast, Judge Holcomb found the petitioner likely to succeed in establishing a violation of his due process rights particularly because the government declined to provide necessary details about the process they proposed to employ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Holcomb found the requirements for class certification without difficulty and accepted the petitioner's putative class as proposed:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\"All noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled &ldquo;Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua&rdquo; and/or its implementation, with the exception of any noncitizen who filed an individual habeas petition prior to the commencement of this action.\"</p>\r\n<p>Judge Holcomb imposed a nominal $1 bond on the petitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 14, petitioner filed an emergency ex parte application for a permanent injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On June 20, Judge Holcomb denied petitioner's ex parte application for a permanent injunction without prejudice and ordered the government \"to file a Status Report no later than July 10, 2025, and every 30 days thereafter, that advises the Court regarding the status of the Government's appeal in [petitioner's] removal and asylum proceedings.\" 2025 WL 2019798.</p>\r\n<p>On August 1, the government appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>On September 2, the court denied petitioner's ex parte application for reconsideration of the writ of habeas corpus and writ of mandamus.

SUMMARY OF DECISION \n  Petitioner-Plaintiff Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan (“Arevalo”) is a Venezuelan \ncitizen who is currently detained at the Desert View Annex or Desert View Modified \nCommunity Correctional Facility, which is associated with the Adelanto Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) Processing Center.1  Arevalo is potentially subject to a \nMarch 2025 executive order, Proclamation No. 10903 (the “Proclamation”), which is \nentitled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion.”2  The Proclamation \nauthorizes and directs the immediate removal of certain Venezuelan citizens.3  See 90 \nFed. Reg. 13033. \n  Presently before the Court are two matters for decision:  (1) Arevalo’s application \nfor a preliminary injunction against Respondents-Defendants Donald J. Trump, Pamela \nBondi, Kristi Noem, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Pete Hegseth, U.S. \nDepartment of Defense, Marco Rubio, U.S. Department of State, Todd Lyons, U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, David Marin, and Fereti Semaia (collectively, \nthe “Government”);4 and (2) Arevalo’s motion for class certification.5 \n  After considering the papers filed in support and in opposition,6 as well as the \narguments of counsel at the hearing, the Court GRANTS in part Arevalo’s Application \nand Motion.  The Government is hereby preliminarily ENJOINED and RESTRAINED \nfrom removing or transferring out of this district any member of the putative class \npursuant to the Proclamation pending further Order of this Court regarding the amount \nof notice and process that is due prior to removal. \n \n1  See generally Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Action Compl. for Decl. and \nInj. Relief (the “Petition”) [ECF No. 1]. \n2  See id. at ¶ 1. \n3  See id. at ¶ 163. \n4  See Pet.-Pl.’s Emergency Appl. for a Temporary Restraining Order (the “Application”) \n[ECF No. 2]. \n5  See Pet.-Pl.’s Mot. for Class Certification (the “Motion”) [ECF No. 3]. \n6  The Court considered the documents of record in this action, including the following \npapers:  (1) Petition; (2) Application; (3) Motion; (4) Resps.-Defs.’ Opp’n to the Motion (the \n“Motion Opposition”) [ECF No. 11]; (5) Resps.-Defs.’ Opp’n to the Application (the \n“Application Opposition”) [ECF No. 12]; and (6) Pet-Pl.’s Reply in Supp. of the Application \nand Motion (the “Reply”) [ECF No. 20]. \n-3- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 4 of 26   Page ID\n#:401\n \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Proclamation \n  On March 14, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order, Proclamation \nNo. 10903, through which he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 21 et seq. (the \n“AEA”), to authorize and direct the immediate removal of certain Venezuelan nationals \npresently in the United States.  See 90 Fed. Reg. 13033.  Specifically, President Trump \nfound and declared that Tren de Aragua, which is a “designated Foreign Terrorist \nOrganization with thousands of members,” was “conducting irregular warfare and \nundertaking hostile actions against the United States.”  Id.  President Trump further \nfound that Tren de Aragua, in connection with Venezuelan authorities, was “perpetrating \nan invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States” and that such an invasion \n“poses a substantial danger to the United States.”  Id.  Based upon those findings, \nPresident Trump authorized and directed the immediate apprehension and removal of \n“all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of [Tren de Aragua], \nare within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent \nresidents of the United States.”  Id. \n  Shortly after the Proclamation became effective, five detainees and a nationwide \nclass sought to enjoin its enforcement.  See Trump v. J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1005 (2025) \n(per curiam).  On March 15, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \nissued two temporary restraining orders preventing the removal of the named plaintiffs \nand preventing the removal under the AEA of any noncitizen in United States custody \nwho was subject to the Proclamation.  See id.  The Government appealed, and the \nSupreme Court ultimately vacated those temporary orders based upon improper venue.  \nSee id.  The Supreme Court also held, however, that “detainees subject to removal orders \nunder the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal,” so \nlong as those detainees pursue their challenges “in the district of confinement.”  Id. \n  After the Supreme Court issued its per curiam opinion in J.G.G., another class of \npretrial detainees applied for a temporary restraining order in the U.S. District Court for \nthe Northern District of Texas.  See A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1417281, at *1 (S. Ct. \nMay 16, 2025) (per curiam).  The district court denied their application because the \nGovernment confirmed that it had “no present plans to remove [the petitioners] until the \nhabeas petition [was] resolved” and that it would “notify the court if that change[d].”  \nA.A.R.P. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1148140, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 17, 2025).  The district court \nalso declined to certify the putative class.  See id. at *5. \n  Hours later, the Government caused some of those detainees to be served with \nnotices of AEA removal and informed them that they would be deported “tonight or \ntomorrow.”  A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1417281, at *3.  The detainees responded by moving for \n-4- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 5 of 26   Page ID\n#:402\n \nan emergency temporary restraining order, and, when the district court did not \nimmediately issue it, they appealed to the Fifth Circuit and then the Supreme Court.  See \nid.  The Fifth Circuit declined to issue an injunction, see A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 2025 WL \n1148141, at *1 (5th Cir. Apr. 18, 2025), but the Supreme Court ordered the Government \n“not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees” and held that the \nGovernment must provide more than 24 hours’ notice before removal.  A.A.R.P., 2025 \nWL 1417281, at *2–*3.  The Supreme Court also vacated the district court’s denial of \nclass certification and temporarily enjoined the Government “from removing putative \nclass members while the question of what notice is due is adjudicated.”  Id. at *3. \nB.  The Facts as Alleged by Arevalo \n  Arevalo is a Venezuelan citizen and a vocal dissident of the Venezuelan \ngovernment.7  Arevalo applied for asylum in the United States, and he was granted a \npermit authorizing him to work and reside in the United States pending the review of his \nasylum application.8  During a scheduled ICE check-in, however, Arevalo was arrested \nand placed in detention at the Desert View Annex or Desert View Modified Community \nCorrectional Facility, which is a part of, or an associate of, the Adelanto ICE Processing \nCenter.9  The Government did not provide Arevalo with prior notice of his arrest nor \nserve him with a warrant or other documentation regarding the basis for his arrest.10  But \nArevalo was informed, presumably by someone associated with the Government, that his \narrest was premised upon his status as a Venezuelan with tattoos, which, although \nallegedly basketball-related, could indicate that Arevalo is affiliated with Tren de \nAragua.11 \n  Arevalo commenced this action by filing his Petition in this Court on Saturday, \nMay 17, 2025, on behalf of himself and a putative class of Venezuelan citizens subject to \nthe Proclamation.12  Through his Petition, Arevalo asserts 20 claims for relief under the \nUnited States Constitution, the California Constitution, and various related statutes.13 \n \n7  Petition ¶ 2. \n8  Id. at ¶ 3. \n9  Id. at ¶ 5. \n10  Id. at ¶ 6. \n11  Id. \n12  See generally id. \n13  See generally id. \n-5- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 6 of 26   Page ID\n#:403\n \n  On the same day that Arevalo filed his Petition, he also filed the instant \nApplication and Motion.14  Through his Application, Arevalo seeks the following \nelements of relief: \n(cid:120)  to prevent the Government from removing Arevalo, or any member of the putative \nclass, from the United States under the Proclamation; \n(cid:120)  to prevent the Government from transferring Arevalo, or any member of the \nputative class, out of this judicial district; \n(cid:120)  to require the Government to provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any removal \nor transfer out of this judicial district pursuant to the Proclamation; \n(cid:120)  to provide Arevalo’s counsel with notice of the transfer into this judicial district of \nany person designated as an Alien Enemy under the Proclamation; and \n(cid:120)  to require the Government reasonably to preserve all property and evidence that it \npossesses regarding Arevalo and any other member of the putative class and to \nprovide that evidence to Arevalo’s counsel upon request.15 \n  On Monday, May 19, 2025, the Court granted, on an emergency basis, part of \nArevalo’s requested relief.16  In that Order, the Court certified—for the purpose of \nimmediate temporary injunctive relief—the following class: \nAll noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, \nor will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled \n“Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United \nStates by Tren de Aragua” and/or its implementation.17 \nThe Court also (1) temporarily enjoined the Government from removing Arevalo, or any \nmember of the putative class, under the AEA or the Proclamation pending further Order \nof this Court; (2) directed the Government to file responses to the Motion and \nApplication no later than 12:00 noon on May 27, 2025; (3) set a hearing on the Motion \nand Application for Friday, May 30, 2025; and (4) provided that the Order would expire \nat the end of the hearing on the Motion and Application.18  During the hearing on Friday, \nMay 30, 2025, the Court issued another Order extending the Temporary Restraining \nOrder to Monday, June 2, 2025.19 \n \n14  See Application; Motion. \n15  See Application. \n16  Ord. re. the Applications (the “Temporary Restraining Order”) [ECF No. 6]. \n17  See id. \n18  See id. \n19  See Order Extending Temporary Restraining Order [ECF No. 22]. \n-6- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 7 of 26   Page ID\n#:404\n \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA.  Rule 65—Preliminary Injunction \n  A party seeking a TRO or a preliminary injunction must establish four elements:  \n“(1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that the plaintiff will likely suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tip in its favor, \nand (4) that the public interest favors an injunction.”  Wells Fargo & Co. v. ABD Ins. & \nFin. Servs., Inc., 758 F.3d 1069, 1071 (9th Cir.), as amended (Mar. 11, 2014) (citing Winter \nv. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  When the nonmoving party is a \ngovernmental entity, the last two Winter factors “merge.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n435 (2009). \n  If a plaintiff seeking to enjoin an alleged constitutional injury “shows he is likely to \nprevail on the merits,” then “that showing will almost always demonstrate he is suffering \nirreparable harm as well.”  Baird v. Bonta, 81 F.4th 1036, 1042 (9th Cir. 2023).  \n“Accordingly, when an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, . . . most \ncourts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”  Id. (quotation and \nbrackets omitted).  Similarly, “[a] plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits of a \nconstitutional claim also tips the merged third and fourth factors decisively in his favor” \nbecause “it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s \nconstitutional rights.”  Id. (quotations omitted).  Thus, a plaintiff who has established \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits “ha[s] also established that both the public \ninterest and the balance of the equities favor a preliminary injunction.”  Id. \n  In the Ninth Circuit, “serious questions going to the merits and a balance of \nhardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury \nand that the injunction is in the public interest.”  All. for Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d \n1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotations omitted). \nB.  Rule 23—Class Certification \n  The class action procedural vehicle is “an exception to the usual rule that litigation \nis conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.”  Wal–Mart Stores, \nInc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 348 (2011) (internal quotations omitted).  To certify a class, \n“plaintiffs must prove the facts necessary to carry the burden of establishing that the \nprerequisites of Rule 23 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] are satisfied by a \npreponderance of the evidence.”  Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods \nLLC, 31 F.4th 651, 665 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc). \n  Rule 23 governs class actions.  A party seeking class certification must establish all \nof the following: \n-7- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 8 of 26   Page ID\n#:405\n \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of \nthe class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4).  After satisfying those four prerequisites—typically referred \nto as “numerosity,” “commonality,” “typicality,” and “adequacy”—a party must also \ndemonstrate one of the following:  (1) a risk that separate actions would create \nincompatible standards of conduct for the defendant or prejudice individual class \nmembers not parties to the action; (2) that the defendant has treated the members of the \nclass as a class, making appropriate injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole; or (3) that common questions of law or fact predominate over questions \naffecting individual members and a class action is a superior method for fairly and \nefficiently adjudicating the action.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)-(3). \n  A district court has broad discretion to grant or deny a motion for class \ncertification.  See Bateman v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 623 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 2010).  \nHowever, “[a] party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his \ncompliance with [Rule 23]—that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact \nsufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.”  Wal-Mart Stores, \n564 U.S. at 350.  A district court must conduct a “rigorous analysis” that frequently “will \nentail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim.”  Id. at 351. \n  Class certification “‘is inherently tentative,’” so “the judge remains free to \nmodify it in the light of subsequent developments in the litigation.”  Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. \nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982) (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469 \nn.11 (1978)).  Additionally, the district court may, within its discretion, amend the class \ndefinition, even sua sponte.  See, e.g., Davis v. Lab’y Corp. of Am. Holdings, 604 F. Supp. 3d \n913, 934 n.16 (C.D. Cal. 2022), aff’d, 2024 WL 489288 (9th Cir. Feb. 8, 2024) (certifying \na class with a definition different than what was proposed in the motion), cert. granted, 145 \nS. Ct. 1133 (2025); see also Davis, 2024 WL 489288, at *1 (noting that, after awarding \nclass certification, “the district court amended  its class certification order to refine the \nclass definitions”).  “This flexibility enhances the usefulness of the class-action device.”  \nFalcon, 457 U.S. at 160. \n-8- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 9 of 26   Page ID\n#:406\n \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Article III Standing \n  As an initial matter, the Court must determine whether Arevalo has standing to \nbring this action.  A federal court may not exercise jurisdiction over a plaintiff’s claim \nunless that plaintiff demonstrates that he or she has Article III standing.  See Lujan v. \nDefs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  To do so, a plaintiff must establish that he or \nshe has “suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is \n(a) concrete and particularized . . . and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical.”  Id. at 560 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  The burden to \nsatisfy the injury-in-fact requirement is particularly demanding for a plaintiff who seeks \ninjunctive relief—such a plaintiff “must demonstrate a ‘real and immediate threat of \nrepeated injury’ in the future.”  Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 946 \n(9th Cir. 2011).  Additionally, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the injury is traceable to \nthe defendant’s conduct and that it is “likely” that “the injury can be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.”  Id. \n  The Government asserts that Arevalo lacks Article III standing because Arevalo is \nbeing detained pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “INA”), not the \nAEA, and, thus, he does not face an imminent risk of deportation.  Specifically, the \nGovernment submitted a declaration from ICE Assistant Field Director Jackson Lara,20 \nthrough which the Government contests some of the allegations in Arevalo’s Petition.  \nAccording to Lara, (1) Arevalo “has not been designated as subject to removal” under the \nProclamation;21 (2) Arevalo failed to obtain prior approval before changing his address;22 \nand (3) Arevalo has an individual removal hearing scheduled for June 9, 2025.23 \n  To the extent that the Court can consider such arguments, see Gonzalez v. U.S. \nImmigr. & Customs Enforcement, 975 F.3d 788, 803 (9th Cir. 2020) (noting that a court \nmust “assess [the plaintiff’s] standing for prospective injunctive relief” by “relying on \nthe allegations in the operative” complaint), the Supreme Court has already rejected \nthem.  In A.A.R.P., a district court in Texas denied preliminary injunctive relief to a \npetitioner and a putative class based upon a similar representation from the \nGovernment—that it did “not intend to remove [the petitioners] under the AEA while \ntheir habeas petitions [were] pending.”  A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1148140, at *3.  After the \ndistrict court denied injunctive relief, however, the Government notified members of the \n \n20  See Decl. of Jackson Lara (the “Lara Declaration”) [ECF No. 12-1]. \n21  Id. at ¶ 6. \n22  Id. at ¶ 13. \n23  Id. at ¶ 17. \n-9- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 10 of 26   Page ID\n#:407\n \nputative class that it would remove them the following day.  See A.A.R.P., 2025 WL \n1417281, at *2.  On appeal, the Government once again committed to “forgo removing \nthe named petitioners pursuant to the AEA while their habeas proceedings [were] \npending”; nevertheless, the Supreme Court issued preliminary injunctive relief against \nthe Government.  Id. at *4. \n  This Court is compelled to follow the precedent that the Supreme Court \nestablished in A.A.R.P.  Although the Government claims that Lara’s testimony proves \nthat Arevalo is not at imminent risk of being deported pursuant to the Proclamation, \nseveral key pieces of information are missing from the Lara Declaration.  For example, \nLara states that Arevalo “has not been designated as subject to removal under the \nAEA,”24 but Lara leaves open the possibility that Arevalo’s designation will change.  \nSimilarly, Lara notes that the “failure to notify ICE of an address change can constitute \ngrounds for terminating a respondent” from an alternative-to-detention program and that \nArevalo failed to obtain prior approval before moving his residence.25  But, notably, Lara \ndoes not testify that Arevalo failed to provide ICE with advance notice of his address \nchange, nor that an asylum applicant’s failure to obtain advance approval of an address \nchange constitutes a ground for detaining that applicant, nor that Arevalo was in fact \ndetained because he failed to provide advance notice or failed to obtain prior approval.26 \n  While those omissions could have been inadvertent, the Government declined to \nassure the Court that they were.  Rather, when the Court pressed the Government on \nthose issues during the hearing, the Government conceded that it may designate Arevalo \nfor removal under the Proclamation at some point in the future and confirmed that ICE \nmay still conclude that Arevalo is subject to the Proclamation.  The Government likewise \nadmitted that it was unsure whether Arevalo will be released from ICE custody if Arevalo \nis granted asylum at his June 9, 2025, removal hearing—even though, if Arevalo were \ndetained pursuant to the INA, the Government would have no reason to continue such \ndetention after he receives asylum.  In view of those representations (or in the absence of \nappropriate assurances) and the Supreme Court’s decision in A.A.R.P., the Court \nconcludes that Arevalo faces an imminent threat of removal pursuant to the \nProclamation, and, accordingly, he has standing to pursue his claims. \n \n24  Id. at ¶ 6. \n25  Id. at ¶¶ 12 & 13. \n26  See generally id. \n-10- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 11 of 26   Page ID\n#:408\n \nB.  Preliminary Injunction \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  Although Arevalo asserts many different claims for relief in his Petition, his core \nallegations in support of his Motion and Application are that (1) the Proclamation is \nunlawful because President Trump has not properly invoked the AEA; and (2) even if the \nProclamation is lawful, no person may be deported pursuant to the AEA until that person \nhas been afforded notice and the opportunity to challenge his designation as an alien \nenemy. \na.  Invocation of the AEA \n  Before addressing Arevalo’s challenges to President Trump’s invocation of the \nAEA, the Court must determine the extent to which the AEA is subject to judicial review.  \nFor the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that, while the Court may interpret \nthe AEA, that interpretation is limited to deciding whether the President has found that \nan invasion or predatory incursion has been perpetrated, attempted, or threatened.  And, \nbecause the President has made such a finding in this instance, the Court may not \nentertain Arevalo’s various challenges to the findings contained in the Proclamation or to \nthe President’s exercise of his AEA authority. \n  Section 21 of the AEA provides as follows: \nWhenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign \nnation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, \nattempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any \nforeign nation or government, and the President makes public proclamation \nof the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or \ngovernment, being of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be \nwithin the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be \napprehended,  restrained,  secured,  and  removed  as  alien  enemies.  The \nPresident is authorized in any such event, by his proclamation thereof, or \nother public act, to direct the conduct to be observed on the part of the United \nStates, toward the aliens who become so liable; the manner and degree of the \nrestraint to which they shall be subject and in what cases, and upon what \nsecurity their residence shall be permitted, and to provide for the removal of \nthose who, not being permitted to reside within the United States, refuse or \nneglect to depart therefrom; and to establish any other regulations which are \nfound necessary in the premises and for the public safety. \nIn March 2025, President Trump invoked Section 21 through the Proclamation, which \nprovides for the immediate apprehension, detention, and removal of “all Venezuelan \n-11- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 12 of 26   Page ID\n#:409\n \ncitizens 14 years of age or older who are members of [Tren de Aragua], are within the \nUnited States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the \nUnited States.”  90 Fed. Reg. 13033.  President Trump’s Proclamation marked the fourth \ntime in this Nation’s history that the AEA had been invoked—and, as relevant here, the \nfirst time that the AEA has been invoked in the face of an invasion or predatory incursion \nrather than a declared war.  See J.O.P. v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Sec., 2025 WL 1431263, \nat *9 (4th Cir. May 19, 2025) (Gregory, J., concurring). \n  Because the AEA has been invoked so rarely, there is limited binding authority \nregarding the role that the judiciary plays once the President has issued a proclamation.  \nNevertheless, in the few months since President Trump issued the Proclamation, several \nother district and circuit courts have addressed challenges like those that Arevalo raises \nhere.  First, in J.G.G. v. Trump, 2025 WL 890401 (D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2025), a District of \nColumbia district court concluded that it is within the court’s province to “construe the \nterms ‘nation,’ ‘government,’ ‘invasion,’ and ‘predatory incursion.’”  Id. at *10.  Two \nD.C. Circuit judges agreed with the district court’s analysis.  In a concurrence to an order \naffirming the district court’s decision, Judge Henderson wrote that a court may not \nevaluate questions for which there is “no answer in the plain text of the Act,” such as \nhow long the President’s authority under the AEA lasts, but a court may decide \n“conditional questions,” such as “the legal meaning of war, invasion and predatory \nincursion.”  J.G.G. v. Trump, 2025 WL 914682, at *6 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025) \n(Henderson, J., concurring).  In a separate concurrence, Judge Millett agreed that \ndefining “invasion” was a classic question of statutory interpretation that could—and \nshould—be resolved “with settled tools of statutory construction.”  Id. at *24 (Millett, J., \nconcurring). \n  A district court in the District of Colorado undertook a similar analysis.  See \nD.B.U. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1163530, at *7 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2025).  Specifically, that \ndistrict court relied upon the Supreme Court’s longstanding rule that “an individual \nsubject to detention and removal under [the AEA] is entitled to judicial review as to \nquestions of interpretation and constitutionality of the [AEA],” J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at \n1006, and decided that, per that rule, a court must construe the terms “invasion” and \n“predatory incursion,”  D.B.U., 2025 WL 1163530, at *7 & *9.  The Colorado district \ncourt then concluded that the AEA uses those terms “to refer to military actions \nindicative of an actual or impending war,” as opposed to “mass illegal migration or \ncriminal activities.”  Id. at *9 (quotations omitted).  From there, the Colorado district \ncourt decided that the Proclamation “makes no finding that satisfies [those] definitional \ndemands,” and, as such, it is unlawful.  Id. at *10. \n  A district court in the Southern District of Texas reached the same conclusion in \nJ.A.V. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1257450 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025).  There, as in D.B.U., the \nTexas district court noted that the Supreme Court has “confirmed that ‘questions of \n-12- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 13 of 26   Page ID\n#:410\n \ninterpretation’ fall within the Judiciary’s responsibility.”  Id. at *9.  The Texas district \ncourt further concluded that, although “matters intimately related to foreign policy and \nnational security are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention,” “[d]etermining \nwhat conduct constitutes an ‘invasion’ or ‘predatory incursion’ for purposes of the AEA \nis distinct from ascertaining whether such events have in fact occurred or are being \nthreatened.”  Id. at *10 (quotations omitted and alterations adopted).  The Texas district \ncourt therefore decided that the judiciary must “define[] the parameters of what conduct \nconstitutes an ‘invasion’ or ‘predatory incursion’” but “leave[] to the Executive Branch \nthe determination of whether such conduct has been perpetrated, attempted, or \nthreatened.”  Id.  And, because the Texas district court was not satisfied that “the factual \nstatements in the Proclamation . . . describe[d] an ‘invasion’ or ‘predatory incursion’”—\nas the Texas district court had defined those terms—it concluded that the Proclamation \n“exceeds the scope of the [AEA] and, as a result, is unlawful.”  Id. at *18; see also \nGutierrez-Contreras v. Warden, 2025 WL 1400402, at *4 (C.D. Cal. May 14, 2025) \n(agreeing with that analysis). \n  Next, in G.F.F. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1301052 (S.D.N.Y. May 6, 2025), a district \ncourt in the Southern District of New York concluded that, “by their very nature,” \ncourts “interpret statutes” and that the AEA was another such statute to be interpreted.  \nId. at *8.  Then the New York district court determined that an “‘invasion, as used in the \nAEA, was understood as a ‘hostile entrance upon the right or possessions of another’ or a \n‘hostile encroachment,’” while an “‘incursion’ was understood to mean an ‘attack’ or \n‘invasion without conquest.’”  Id. at *9-10 (alterations adopted).  And, because “nothing \nin the AEA” suggested that “refugees migrating from Venezuela, or [Tren de Aragua] \ngangsters who infiltrate the migrants . . . seek to occupy territory, to oust American \njurisdiction from any territory, or to ravage territory,” the New York district court \nconcluded that “the predicates for the Presidential Proclamation . . . do not exist” and \nthat the Proclamation “exceeds the scope of the AEA.”  Id. \n  Finally, in A.S.R. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1378784 (W.D. Pa. May 13, 2025), a district \ncourt in the Western District of Pennsylvania took a slightly different approach.  There, \nthe Pennsylvania district court defined “predatory incursion” to mean “a hostile entry \ninto the United States by a cohesive group of individuals . . . who are united by a common \ngoal of causing significant disruption to the public safety—whether that be the safety of \npersons, proper[ty], or pecuniary interests—of those within the United States.”  Id. at \n*17.  And, unlike the other district courts that recently interpreted the AEA, the \nPennsylvania court determined that the Proclamation “complie[d] with the AEA” \nbecause it included findings that satisfied the Pennsylvania district court’s definition of \n“predatory incursion.”  Id. at *17–*18. \n  The Government urges this Court to conclude that all of those decisions rest on \nany\nthe faulty premise that the judiciary may conduct   review of the President’s \n-13- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 14 of 26   Page ID\n#:411\n \nProclamation.  According to the Government, “the President’s authority under the AEA \nis not a proper subject for judicial scrutiny,”27 and “[w]hether the AEA’s preconditions \nare satisfied is a political question committed to the President’s discretion.”28  Thus, the \nGovernment asserts that, if this Court interprets the AEA in any way, that action will \nviolate the political question doctrine and interfere with the separation of powers.29 \n  The Court disagrees with the Government, but the Court also disagrees with the \nother district courts that have considered this question.  In Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U.S. \n160 (1948), the Supreme Court addressed a claim that the President’s authority under the \nAEA, if invoked during a time of war, “did not survive cessation of actual hostilities.”  Id. \nat 166.  The Supreme Court held that “questions of interpretation and constitutionality” \nof the AEA were properly before it.  Id. at 163.  But despite being presented with those \nquestions, the Supreme Court’s review of the AEA extended only as far as was necessary \nto conclude that the President had “proclaimed that ‘a state of war still exists.’”  Id. at \n170.  The Supreme Court did not “question [the] belief by the President that enemy \naliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities” \nretained “their potency for mischief” after active hostilities ended.  Id.  And, as relevant \nhere, the Supreme Court declined plaintiff Ludecke’s invitation to adopt a definition of \n“declared war” that would conflict with the President’s decision that a state of war \npersisted.  See generally id. \n  That analysis is consistent with the manner in which courts have, until President \nTrump’s instant Proclamation, approached challenges to a President’s authority under \nthe AEA.  In Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950), for example, the Supreme Court \nheld that, while a court must “entertain [an alien’s] plea for freedom from Executive \ncustody only to ascertain the existence of a state of war and whether he is an alien enemy \nand so subject to” the AEA, the President’s “power over enemy aliens” must remain \n“undelayed and unhampered by litigation.”  Id. at 773–74.  In U.S. ex rel. Kessler v. \nWatkins, 163 F.2d 140 (2d Cir. 1947), the Second Circuit interpreted the meaning of \n“invasion” and “predatory incursion,” but only because doing so was necessary to reject \nthe premise that the President’s ability to “exercise” authority under the AEA was \n“limited to times of active hostilities.”  Id.at 142.  And in Citizens Protective League v. \nClark, 155 F.2d 290, 295 (D.C. Cir. 1946), the D.C. Circuit addressed a claim that alien \nenemies who were “merely potentially [hostile] because of their allegiance” to a foreign \nnation were not “dangerous.”  Id. at 294.  Like the Supreme Court and the Second \n \n27  Application Opposition 7:15–16. \n28  Id. at 8:8–10. \n29  See id. at 7:5–9:13. \n-14- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 15 of 26   Page ID\n#:412\n \nCircuit, the D.C. Circuit construed the AEA only to the extent necessary to reject the \nargument that the President had exceeded the scope of his authority under the AEA.  Id. \n  The Court views its role in interpreting the AEA as constrained by those \nprecedents.  Specifically, although Arevalo invites the Court to define the terms \n“invasion” and “predatory incursion,” that invitation is indistinguishable from \nLudecke’s invitation in 1948 for the Supreme Court to define “war” as “active \nhostilities.”  See Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 166.  And like the Supreme Court, this Court does \nnot believe that the AEA permits it to accept such an invitation.  Rather, the plain text of \nthe AEA makes clear that the President’s authority to detain and remove noncitizens \nhinges upon the President’s “proclamation” that “any invasion or predatory incursion is \nperpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States.”  See 50 \nU.S.C. § 21.  By its nature, that congressional grant of authority leaves it to the President \nto decide whether an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” has occurred.  See id.; see also \nLudecke, 335 U.S. at 170 (holding that the AEA leaves the act of determining whether a \n“war” is ongoing to “the usual political agencies of the Government”).  And, because the \nAEA permits the President to decide whether those events have occurred, the AEA \nnecessarily also grants to the President the discretion to decide what those terms mean. \n  That conclusion is reinforced by the approaches that several other courts have \ntaken with respect to President Trump’s Proclamation.  Although the other courts that \nhave addressed this issue have construed the terms contained in the AEA, many—if not \nall—of those courts also acknowledged that they must accept the President’s factual \nfindings and refrain from questioning “the propriety of the steps taken by the President as \nto Venezuelan aliens and [Tren de Aragua] members.”  J.A.V., 2025 WL 1257450, at *9.  \nThat deference is unsurprising.  The Supreme Court has long recognized that \n“limitation[s] upon congressional delegations of power to the President over internal \naffairs do[] not apply with respect to delegations of power in external affairs.”  \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 n.2 (1952) (Jackson, J., \nconcurring).  And the AEA’s delegation of power to the President is “as unlimited as the \nlegislature could make it.”  Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 164.  Thus, when the President exercises \nhis authority under the AEA, he “acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of \nCongress,” and the judiciary must defer to his judgment.  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 635. \n  Moreover, although some courts have attempted to construe the terms contained \nin the AEA while purporting to defer to the President’s judgment about the existence of \neither an invasion or predatory incursion, the Court sees no way to strike such a balance.  \nImagine that this Court concludes—as several other courts have—that an “invasion” or \n“predatory incursion” requires “an organized, armed force entering the United States to \nengage in conduct destructive of property and human life in a specific geographical area.”  \nJ.A.V., 2025 WL 1257450, at *17.  That definition necessarily reflects the Court’s own \ndeterminations about what circumstances can and cannot constitute an “invasion” or \n-15- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 16 of 26   Page ID\n#:413\n \n“predatory incursion.”  See, e.g., id. at 18 (concluding that “harm[ing] lives in the United \nStats and enagag[ing] in crime” does not constitute a predatory incursion but that \n“attack[ing] a city, coastal town, or other defined geographic area, with the purpose of \nplundering or destroying property or lives” would); see also A.S.R., 2025 WL 1378784, at \n*18 (concluding that Tren de Aragua’s actions amount to a predatory incursion because \nTren de Aragua resembles “military detachments or pirates around the time that \nCongress enacted the AEA”).  But the AEA provides that the President—and not an \nArticle III court—may proclaim whether an invasion or predatory incursion exists.  Thus, \nconstruing those terms is inconsistent with the text of the AEA. \n  Similarly, to the extent that the Supreme Court has suggested that a court may \ninquire into whether a “declared war” exists, see Johnson, 339 U.S. at 775, that inquiry \ndoes not imply that a court may delve into whether an “invasion” or “predatory \nincursion” exists.  Congress alone has the authority to declare war, so asking whether a \nwar has been declared does not constrict the President’s authority under the AEA.  But a \ncourt cannot decide whether an invasion or a predatory incursion exists without \nsupplanting, to some degree, the President’s discretion.  If the court defines “invasion” \nto require an “organized, armed group of individuals entering the United States . . . to \nconquer the country or assume control over a portion of the nation,” see, e.g., J.A.V., \n2025 WL 1257450, at *18, that determination precludes the President from deciding that \nan “invasion” occurs if a foreign nation launches an unmanned drone or cyber-attack on \nthe United States or if a foreign military aggressively enters the United States for some \npurpose other than assuming control over U.S. territory.30  Nothing in the AEA suggests \nthat the President’s authority is limited in that way.  See Ludecke, 355 U.S. at 170. \n  In short, the AEA’s grant of authority to the President is close to “unlimited,” id. \nat 164, and it includes the ability to decide whether an invasion or predatory incursion has \noccurred.  As such, this Court cannot construe those terms without constraining the \nPresident’s authority under the AEA.  In view of Congress’s decision to grant that \nauthority to the President, that constraint is one that courts, which too “often suffer the \ninfirmity of confusing the issue of a power’s validity with the cause it is invoked to \npromote” and “of confounding the permanent executive office with its temporary \noccupant,” must decline to impose.  See Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 634.  Accordingly, the \nCourt concludes that Arevalo is unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim that the \nProclamation is unlawful. \n \n30  The history of warfare is replete with instances of an aggressor’s territorial invasion that \nis not conducted for the purpose of exercising sovereignty over the victim’s land, including, for \nexample, the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.  See, e.g., Geoffrey Wawro, The Franco-Prussian War \n(2003) (explaining, inter alia, that Bismarck’s primary goal in provoking France was to unite \nGermany under Prussian leadership, not to expand its territory). \n-16- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 17 of 26   Page ID\n#:414\n \nb.  Due Process Clause \n  Although Arevalo is unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim that the \nProclamation is unlawful, the Court concludes that Arevalo is likely to succeed on the \nmerits of his due process claims.  Indeed, the Government—which concedes that it must \nprovide detainees notice and process before removing them under the AEA—does not \nappear to disagree that Arevalo will succeed on his due process claims.31  Instead, the \nGovernment argues that (1) Arevalo has necessarily already received adequate notice and \nprocess because he filed a habeas petition; and (2) the due process requirements are \nsatisfied because the Government agreed to provide notice to detainees before removing \nthem. \n  To the extent that those arguments relate to the merits of Arevalo’s claims, they \nare unavailing.  Because the Government insists that it has not provided Arevalo with \nnotice and urges the Court to dismiss Arevalo’s habeas petition on that basis, the Court is \nhard-pressed to conclude that the filing of the habeas petition somehow means that \nArevalo has already received adequate process and notice.  See A.A.R.P., 2025 WL \n1417281, at *4 (“[W]e are skeptical of the self-defeating notion that the right to the notice \nnecessary to ‘actually seek habeas relief’ . . . must itself be vindicated through individual \nhabeas petitions, somehow by plaintiffs who have not received notice.”  (citation omitted) \n(emphasis in original)).  Similarly, although the Government indicates that it will provide \ndetainees with more than 24 hours’ notice of their removals, during the hearing the \nGovernment refused to tell the Court how much notice it actually intends to provide.  \nRather, the Government informed the Court that it is unsure whether it will provide even \n14 days’ notice to detainees before removing them—despite that another court in this \njudicial district has already concluded that such notice is constitutionally required.  See \nGutierrez-Contreras, 2025 WL 1400402, at *6. \n  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Arevalo is likely to succeed on his claim that \nAEA detainees are entitled to more notice and process than the Government has \npromised to provide and that, as such, Arevalo is likely to succeed on the merits of his due \nprocess claim. \n2.  Irreparable Harm \n  Because the likelihood-of-success factor is “the most important factor” to be \nconsidered when evaluating whether a plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction, a \nplaintiff who “shows he is likely to prevail on the merits” of a constitutional claim “will \nalmost always demonstrate he is suffering irreparable harm as well.”  Baird, 81 F.4th at \n \n31  See generally Application Opposition. \n-17- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 18 of 26   Page ID\n#:415\n \n1042.  Thus, “most courts hold that” when a plaintiff demonstrates that his or her \nconstitutional rights are at issue, “no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”  \nId. \n  Although the Ninth Circuit has recognized that the potential deprivation of a \nconstitutional right “unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury,” Planned Parenthood \nof Ariz., Inc. v. Humble, 753 F.3d 905, 911 (9th Cir. 2014), abrogated on other grounds by \nDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215 (2022), the Government nevertheless \nargues that Arevalo will suffer no irreparable harm because (1) he is receiving the process \nthat he is due through removal proceedings pursuant to the INA; (2) the Government \nprovides adequate process under the AEA; and (3) Arevalo has not proven that he would \nface persecution if he were removed from the United States.32  None of those arguments \nis persuasive. \n  First, as the Government asserts, the INA and the AEA are independent statutes \nwith distinct requirements.  Thus, the fact that Arevalo will receive a hearing through his \nINA proceeding has no bearing on his AEA-related claim.  Rather, as the Government \nconceded at the hearing, the Government may choose to keep Arevalo in custody or \nremove him from the United States even if Arevalo receives a favorable determination \nthrough his INA proceeding.  See, e.g., J.O.P., 2025 WL 1431263, at *1 (Benjamin, J., \nconcurring) (discussing that an asylum applicant was removed pursuant to the \nProclamation despite a pending asylum decision that permitted the applicant to remain in \nthe United States). \n  Second, in view of the Government’s refusal to outline the precise notice that it \nwill provide prior to removing a detainee pursuant to the Proclamation, the \nsome\nGovernment’s promise to provide   notice fails to mitigate the injury that Arevalo \nmay suffer in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief.  Assume, for example, that the \nGovernment decides to provide a detainee with three days’ notice that he will be removed \nand that such notice allows insufficient time for the detainee to seek judicial review.  If the \ndetainee were not permitted to seek injunctive relief until after the Government provided \nthe three-day notice, then the detainee would be removed before he could seek any relief \nat all.  See A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1417281, at *2.  But once a detainee is removed, he loses \nthe ability to pursue habeas relief, and, as such, he loses the ability to pursue any relief at \nall.  See Johnson, 339 U.S. at 778 (“A basic consideration in habeas practice is that the \nprisoner will be produced before the court.”).  Thus, the only way to preserve the \ndetainee’s ability to seek judicial review is to restrain the Government from removing \nsomeone without providing notice that the Court has already deemed sufficient. \n \n32  Id. at 23:19–24:12. \n-18- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 19 of 26   Page ID\n#:416\n \n  Finally, the possibility that Arevalo will be tortured or persecuted if he is removed \nfrom the United States is beside the point.  Through his due process claim, Arevalo seeks \nto avoid being deported as an alien enemy without being afforded the opportunity to \nchallenge that designation—not to avoid deportation altogether.  Thus, the potential \nharm is that, in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief, the Government would \ndeport Arevalo without allowing him to challenge his designation as an alien enemy.  \nBecause—as the Supreme Court has noted—the Government has already attempted to \ntake such steps in other cases, see A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1417281, at *1, this Court is \nreluctant to conclude that it would not do so here. \n3.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest \n  Just as a plaintiff who is likely to succeed on the merits of his constitutional claim \n“almost always” demonstrates that he is suffering an irreparable injury, “[a] plaintiff’s \nlikelihood of success on the merits of a constitutional claim also tips the merged third and \nfourth factors decisively in his favor.”  Baird, 81 F.4th at 1042.  Indeed, “it is always in \nthe public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.”  Fellowship \nof Christian Athletes v. San Jose Unified Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 82 F.4th 664, 695 (9th Cir. \n2023) (en banc).  And the Government “cannot reasonably assert that it is harmed in any \nlegally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.”  Zepeda v. INS, \n753 F.2d 719, 727 (9th Cir. 1983).  Thus, “plaintiffs who are able to establish a likelihood \nthat a policy violates the U.S. Constitution have also established that both the public \ninterest and the balance of the equities favor a preliminary injunction.”  Baird, 81 F.4th at \n1042 (quotation and alterations omitted). \n  Arevalo’s likelihood of success on the merits “tips the merged third and fourth \nfactors decisively” in his favor, id., and the Government has not offered any persuasive \nreason for the Court to conclude otherwise.  At bottom, the Government argues that the \npublic interest and equity factors favor the Government because the President must \nremain free to conduct foreign policy.33  But unless the Government intends to abandon \nits promise to provide detainees with reasonable opportunities to challenge their \ndesignations, it is unclear how preliminary injunctive relief would deter or prevent the \nGovernment from doing anything it would otherwise do.  Similarly, the Government may \ncontinue to develop and implement the notice and removal procedures that the \nGovernment finds appropriate, and, if the Court concludes that those procedures are in \nfact appropriate, the Government may undertake removals.  And, importantly, the \nGovernment may carry out lawful removal proceedings under other statutes or \nauthorities, including the INA. \n \n33  Id. at 24:13–25:23. \n-19- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 20 of 26   Page ID\n#:417\n \n  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Arevalo has satisfied all of the requirements \nfor preliminary injunctive relief and GRANTS Arevalo’s Application. \n4.  Bond \n  When a district court grants a motion for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff is \nrequired to post security “in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs \nand damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  A district court has “wide discretion in determining \nthe amount of bond.”  Renna v. Bonta, 667 F. Supp. 3d 1048, 1071 (S.D. Cal. 2023).  \nIndeed, a district court “has discretion to dispense with the security requirement” \naltogether if “requiring security would effectively deny access to judicial review,” and \ncourts “routinely impose either no bond or a minimal bond” in cases involving public \ninterests.  City of South Pasadena v. Slater, 56 F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1148 (C.D. Cal. 1999).  \nThat is particularly true when, as here, a plaintiff seeks to vindicate a constitutional right.  \nSee Renna, 667 F. Supp. 3d at 1071. \n  The Government has requested that, if the Court grants Arevalo preliminary \ninjunctive relief, the Court also require Arevalo to post security for taxpayer funds if it is \ndetermined that the Government was wrongfully enjoined.  The Government maintains, \nhowever, that Arevalo is being detained pursuant to the INA, not the AEA, and that it \nwould provide Arevalo with all of the process that he is due whether or not the Court \ngrants Arevalo preliminary injunctive relief.  In view of those representations, the \nGovernment’s compliance with the Court’s Order will impose little, if any, additional \ncost to the Government or the taxpayers.  Accordingly, the Court ORDERS Arevalo to \nprovide nominal security of $1.34 \nC.  Class Certification \n  Arevalo also seeks to certify the following class: \nAll noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, \nor will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled \n“Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United \nStates by Tren de Aragua” and/or its implementation, with the exception of \nany  noncitizen  who  filed  an  individual  habeas  petition  prior  to  the \ncommencement of this action. \n \n34  See Pet.-Pl.’s Emergency Conference to Clarify/Modify Bond Request [ECF No. 24] \n(requesting a nominal bond of $1). \n-20- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 21 of 26   Page ID\n#:418\n \n  As an initial matter, the Government argues that class proceedings are unavailable \nin the habeas context.35  There is significant support for the Government’s position.  See, \ne.g., A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1417281, at *9 (Alito, J., concurring) (“[I]t is doubtful that class \nrelief may be obtained in a habeas proceeding.”); Betschart v. Oregon, 103 F.4th 607, 635 \n(9th Cir. 2024) (Bumatay, J., dissenting) (“Whether habeas relief is available through \nclass actions remains an open question at the Supreme Court.”).  But the Ninth Circuit \nhas long held that habeas claims may be pursued on a class-wide basis, see Mead v. Parker, \n464 F.2d 1108, 1113 (9th Cir. 1972), and it has affirmed those holdings as recently as May \n2024, see Betschart, 103 F.4th at 615–16 (affirming that the Ninth Circuit’s “binding \nprecedent, which establishes that a class action can lie in habeas . . . remains valid”). \n  Accordingly, the Court concludes that habeas petitioners are not barred from \npursuing class-wide relief. \n1.  Rule 23(a) Factors \na.  Numerosity \n  “A class satisfies the prerequisite of numerosity if it is so large that joinder of all \nclass members is impracticable.”  Ahlman v. Barnes, 445 F. Supp. 3d 671, 684 (C.D. Cal. \n2020) (citing Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998)).  “To be \nimpracticable, joinder must be difficult or inconvenient.”  Id.  Generally, the numerosity \nrequirement is satisfied when a proposed class includes 40 or more members.  See id. \n  Although a plaintiff must provide more than “mere conclusory allegations as to the \nestimated class size,” courts in the Ninth Circuit “relax[]” the numerosity requirement \nwhen a plaintiff seeks only injunctive or declaratory relief, which means that “even \nspeculative or conclusory representations” can suffice.  Sueoka v. United States, 101 \nF. App’x 649, 653 (9th Cir. 2004).  Additionally, when the plaintiff has not had the \nbenefit of discovery and the relevant evidence “is within the sole possession of the \ndefendant,” the plaintiff’s burden is merely “to demonstrate that discovery measures are \nlikely to produce persuasive information substantiating the class action allegations.”  \nDoninger v. Pac. Northwest Bell, Inc., 564 F.2d 1304, 1313 (9th Cir. 1977). \n  Arevalo has not offered evidence regarding the actual size of the putative class, but \nhe speculates that there are enough members to preclude individual joinder for several \nreasons.  First, Arevalo alleges that “[h]undreds if not thousands of Venezuelans living in \nCalifornia and the greater Western U.S. region will potentially be subjected to summary \n \n35  See Motion Opposition 5:22–6:22. \n-21- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 22 of 26   Page ID\n#:419\n \ndetention and removal.”36  Next, Arevalo argues that the Government has already \nremoved at least 137 Venezuelans, and it will likely detain and attempt to remove many \nmore.37  According to Arevalo, those removals will necessarily include many people in \nthis judicial district because “California contains one of the largest populations of \nVenezuelans in the United States.”38  Finally, Arevalo speculates that the Government’s \npractice of transferring groups of Venezuelan detainees to Texas facilities is “being held \nup by court orders currently being litigated,” which may lead the Government to transfer \nthose detainees to this judicial district instead.39 \n  In view of the Ninth Circuit’s flexible approach to the numerosity requirement in \ncases in which a plaintiff who has not yet been able to conduct discovery seeks only \ninjunctive or declaratory relief, the Court concludes that Arevalo’s speculative allegations \nregarding the potential class size satisfy the numerosity requirement. \nb.  Commonality \n  “[C]ommonality requires that the Class Members’ claims ‘depend upon a \ncommon contention’ such that ‘determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each claim in one stroke.’”  Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Assocs., \nInc., 731 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350).  To \nsatisfy Rule 23(a)(2), common questions must be “‘central to the validity’ of the claims \nand capable of being resolved ‘in one stroke.’”  Black Lives Matter L.A. v. City of Los \nAngeles, 113 F.4th 1249, 1258 (9th Cir. 2024) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350).  \nNot every question must be common to the class; “a single significant question of law or \nfact” satisfies the commonality requirement.  Abdullah, 731 F.3d at 957 (emphasis and \nquotation omitted). \n  The Government maintains that there is no question capable of resolution on a \nclass-wide basis because each class member’s habeas claim will require individual \nevidence and proof, such that “a common answer will not resolve this litigation.”40  But \ncommonality does not require the merits of every class member’s claim to be identical nor \nfor those claims be resolved with a single class-wide outcome.  See id.  Rather, \ncommonality requires that the class members’ claims rest upon “a common contention” \nfor which a determination “will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one \nof the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350.  At a minimum, the \n \n36  Petition ¶ 256. \n37  See id. \n38  Id. \n39  Id. \n40  Motion Opposition 7:22–23. \n-22- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 23 of 26   Page ID\n#:420\n \namount of notice that the Government must provide to a detainee prior to removal—\nwhich is an important issue on which the parties disagree and on which the answer will be \nthe same for every class member—qualifies as such a question. \n  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the commonality requirement is satisfied. \nc.  Typicality \n  “To demonstrate typicality, Plaintiffs must show that the named parties’ claims \nare typical of the class.”  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 984 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3)).  “The test of typicality ‘is whether other members have \nthe same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to \nthe named plaintiffs, and whether other Class Members have been injured by the same \ncourse of conduct.’”  Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992) \n(quotation omitted).  The Rule 23(a)(3) standard is “permissive,” and it requires only \nthat the representative’s claims are “‘reasonably co-extensive with those of absent Class \nMembers.’”  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1124 (9th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). \n  The Government contends that Arevalo cannot satisfy the typicality requirement \nbecause he has not sustained any injury and, unlike other members of the class, he has not \nbeen detained pursuant to the AEA.41  Other courts have rejected similar arguments from \nthe Government, see, e.g., D.B.U., 2025 WL 1163530, at *5, and the Court agrees with \nthose courts on this issue.  As explained above, although the Government asserts that \nArevalo is being detained pursuant to the INA, the Government has also indicated that, if \nArevalo receives a favorable outcome in his INA proceedings, the Government will not \nnecessarily release Arevalo—which suggests that the INA may not be the sole reason for \nArevalo’s detention.  Similarly, the Government has admitted that, even if it has not yet \ndetermined that Arevalo is subject to the Proclamation, the Government may make such a \ndetermination in the future.  Thus, Arevalo’s claim is “reasonably co-extensive with \nthose of absent Class Members” in that Arevalo, like the other class members, is at risk of \nremoval pursuant to the Proclamation without adequate notice and process.  Rodriguez, \n591 F.3d at 1124 (quotation omitted). \nd.  Adequacy \n  The Federal Rules require that the class representative “fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Representation is \n“adequate” when (1) counsel for the class is qualified and competent; (2) the \nrepresentatives’ interests are not antagonistic to the interests of absent class members; \nand (3) it is unlikely that the action is collusive.  See O’Connor v. Boeing North American, \n \n41  See id. at 9:1–20. \n-23- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 24 of 26   Page ID\n#:421\n \nInc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 335 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (citing In re N. Dist. of California, Dalkon Shield \nIUD Prod. Liab. Litig., 693 F.2d 847, 855 (9th Cir.), as amended (July 15, 1982)). \n  The Government argues that, because Arevalo is scheduled to appear at a removal \nand asylum hearing before an immigration judge in a matter of days, he “may have no \nincentive to prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class.”42  The Court \ndisagrees.  The INA is a complex, technical set of statutes that contains many “opaque \nand, at times, inflexible requirements.”  Xiao Lu Ma v. Sessions, 907 F.3d 1191, 1199 (9th \nCir. 2018).  Meanwhile, the Government views the AEA, which largely “preclude[s] \njudicial review,” Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 164, as a far less complicated avenue by which the \nGovernment can effectuate the removal of noncitizens.  The Government also appears to \nview the AEA as a potential alternative to INA removal that the Government may use \nwhen INA removal is unavailable.  See, e.g., J.O.P., 2025 WL 1431263, at *1 (Benjamin, J., \nconcurring).  Thus, the Court sees no reason to doubt that Arevalo will vigorously litigate \nthe class claims regardless of his pending INA proceedings. \n  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Arevalo has satisfied the adequacy \nprerequisite. \n2.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n  In addition to the requirements of Rule 23(a), the proposed class “must satisfy at \nleast one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at \n345.  When, as here, the class seeks injunctive relief, the only appropriate avenue for \ncertification lies in Rule 23(b)(2), which permits a court to certify a class only if the \ndefendant “has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief . . . is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Rule 23(b)(2) does not permit certification when a class asserts \n“claims for individualized relief,” such as claims for backpay, or “when each class \nmember would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.”  Wal-Mart \nStores, 564 U.S. at 360–61 (emphasis in original).  Rule 23(b)(2) also forbids the \ncertification of a class whose members “would be entitled to a different injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment against the defendant.”  Id. at 360 (emphasis in original). \n  The Government asserts that the Court cannot issue injunctive relief on a class-\nwide basis because the only relief available to a habeas petitioner is an order of release.  \nThe Court disagrees.  As the Government confirmed during the hearing, the Government \nhas not yet decided what notice it will provide to a detainee prior to removing that \ndetainee pursuant to the Proclamation.  The Government also has not decided what \n \n42  Id. at 10:6–7 (quotation marks omitted). \n-24- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 25 of 26   Page ID\n#:422\n \nprocess or procedures it will use to determine whether an individual is subject to removal \nunder the Proclamation.  Arevalo, meanwhile, seeks a judicial determination regarding \nthe notice and process that the Government must provide to detainees prior to removal.  \nThus, a decision in Arevalo’s favor would provide class-wide relief by enjoining the \nGovernment from removing class members without first providing notice that the Court \ndeems adequate—even if the Court does not order the release of any class member. \n  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Arevalo has satisfied each of the \nRule 23(2)(2) prerequisites and GRANTS Arevalo’s Class Certification Motion. \nV.  DISPOSITION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby ORDERS as follows: \n1.  Arevalo’s instant Motion and Application [ECF Nos. 2 & 3] are \nGRANTED in part. \n2.  The following class is CERTIFIED, for the limited purpose of granting \npreliminary injunctive relief: \nAll noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who were, are, \nor will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled \n“Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United \nStates by Tren de Aragua” and/or its implementation, with the exception of \nany  noncitizen  who  filed  an  individual  habeas  petition  prior  to  the \ncommencement of this action. \n3.  The Government is hereby preliminarily ENJOINED and RESTRAINED \nfrom removing Arevalo, or any member of the putative class, under the AEA or \nProclamation No. 10903, pending further Order of this Court. \n4.  The Government is further preliminarily ENJOINED and RESTRAINED \nfrom transferring Arevalo, or any member of the putative class, out of this judicial district \nfor any purpose other than executing a removal order lawfully issued under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act. \n5.  Arevalo is DIRECTED to post a bond in the nominal sum of $1 no later \nthan June 16, 2025. \n6.  This Order shall not prevent the Government from releasing from \ndetention Arevalo or any class member.  Similarly, this Order shall not prevent the \n-25- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 29     Filed 06/02/25     Page 26 of 26   Page ID\n#:423",

SUMMARY OF DECISION \n2   Petitioner-Plaintiff Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan (“Arevalo”) is a \n3 Venezuelan citizen who is currently detained at the Desert View Annex or \n4 Desert View Modified Community Correctional Facility, which is associated \n5 with the Adelanto Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) Processing \n6 Center.1  Arevalo is potentially subject to a March 2025 executive order, \n7 Proclamation No. 10903, which is entitled “Protecting the American People \n8 Against Invasion.”2  Proclamation No. 10903 authorizes and directs the \n9 immediate removal of certain Venezuelan citizens.3  See 90 Fed. Reg. 13033. \n10   Presently before the Court are two matters for decision:  (1) Arevalo’s \n11 ex parte application for a Temporary Restraining Order against Respondents-\n12 Defendants Donald J. Trump, Pamela Bondi, Kristi Noem, U.S. Department of \n13 Homeland Security, Pete Hegseth, U.S. Department of Defense, Marco Rubio, \n14 U.S. Department of State, Todd Lyons, U.S. Immigration and Customs \n15 Enforcement, David Marin, and Fereti Semaia (collectively, the \n16 “Government”);4 and (2) Arevalo’s motion for class certification, which the \n17 Court construes as an ex parte application to certify a class for the purpose of \n18 immediate injunctive relief.5 \n19   For the reasons explained below, the Court GRANTS in part Arevalo’s \n20 Applications.  The Government is hereby temporarily ENJOINED and \n21\n \n22 1  See generally Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Action Compl. \nfor Decl. and Inj.

BACKGROUND \n5 A.  Proclamation No. 10903 \n6   On March 14, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order, \n7 Proclamation No. 10903, through which he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, 50 \n8 U.S.C. §§ 21 et seq. (the “AEA”), to authorize and direct the immediate \n9 removal of Venezuelan nationals presently in the United States.  See 90 Fed. \n10 Reg. 13033.  Specifically, President Trump found and declared that Tren de \n11 Aragua, which is a “designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands \n12 of members,” was “conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions \n13 against the United States.”  Id.  President Trump further found that Tren de \n14 Aragua, in connection with Venezuelan authorities, was “perpetrating an \n15 invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States” and that such an \n16 invasion “poses a substantial danger to the United States.”  Id.  Based upon \n17 those findings, President Trump authorized and directed the immediate \n18 apprehension and removal of “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older \n19 who are members of [Tren de Aragua], are within the United States, and are not \n20 actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States.”  Id. \n21   Shortly after Proclamation No. 10903 became effective, five detainees and \n22 a nationwide class sought to enjoin its enforcement.  See Trump v. J.G.G., 145 \n23 S. Ct. 1003, 1005 (2025) (per curiam).  On March 15, 2025, the U.S. District \n24 Court for the District of Columbia issued two temporary restraining orders \n25 preventing the removal of the named plaintiffs and preventing the removal \n26 under the AEA of any noncitizen in United States custody who was subject to \n27 the Proclamation.  See id.  The Government appealed those temporary \n28 restraining orders, and the Supreme Court vacated the orders based upon \n-4- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 6     Filed 05/19/25     Page 5 of 13   Page ID\n#:173\n \n1 improper venue.  See id.  The Supreme Court also held, however, that \n2 “detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and \n3 an opportunity to challenge their removal,” so long as those detainees pursue \n4 their challenges “in the district of confinement.”  Id. \n5   After the Supreme Court issued its per curiam opinion in J.G.G., another \n6 class of pretrial detainees applied for temporary restraining orders in the U.S. \n7 District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  See A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 2025 \n8 WL 1417281, at *1 (S. Ct. May 16, 2025) (per curiam).  The district court denied \n9 their application because the Government confirmed that it had “no present \n10 plans to remove [the petitioners] until the habeas petition [was] resolved” and \n11 that it “would notify the court if that change[d].”  A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 2025 WL \n12 1148140, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 17, 2025).  The district court also declined to \n13 certify the putative class.  See id. at *5. \n14   Hours later, the Government caused the detainees to be served with \n15 notices of AEA removal and informed them that they would be deported \n16 “tonight or tomorrow.”  A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1417281, at *3.  The detainees \n17 responded by moving for an emergency temporary restraining order, and, when \n18 the district court did not immediately issue it, they appealed to the Fifth Circuit \n19 and the Supreme Court.  See id.  The Fifth Circuit declined to issue an \n20 injunction, see A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1148141, at *1 (5th Cir. Apr. 18, \n21 2025), but the Supreme Court ordered the Government “not to remove any \n22 member of the putative class of detainees” and held that the Government must \n23 provide more than 24 hours’ notice before removal.  Id. at *2–*3.  The Supreme \n24 Court also vacated the district court’s denial of class certification and \n25 temporarily enjoined the Government “from removing putative class members \n26 while the question of what notice is due is adjudicated.”  Id. at *3. \n27\n28\n-5- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 6     Filed 05/19/25     Page 6 of 13   Page ID\n#:174\n \n1 B.  The Facts as Alleged by Arevalo \n2   Arevalo is a Venezuelan citizen and a vocal dissident of the Venezuelan \n3 government.6  Arevalo applied for asylum in the United States, and he was \n4 previously granted a permit authorizing him to work and reside in the United \n5 States pending the review of his asylum application.7  During a scheduled ICE \n6 check-in, however, Arevalo was arrested and placed in detention at the Desert \n7 View Annex or Desert View Modified Community Correctional Facility, which \n8 is a part of, or an associate of, the Adelanto ICE Processing Center.8  The \n9 Government did not provide Arevalo with prior notice of his arrest nor serve \n10 him with a warrant or other documentation regarding the basis for his arrest.9  \n11 But Arevalo was informed, presumably by someone associated with the \n12 Government, that his arrest was premised upon his status as a Venezuelan with \n13 tattoos, which, although allegedly basketball-related, could indicate that Arevalo \n14 is affiliated with Tren de Aragua.10 \n15   Arevalo commenced this action by filing his Petition in this Court on \n16 Saturday, May 17, 2025, on behalf of himself and a putative class of Venezuelan \n17 citizens subject to Proclamation No. 10903.11  Through his Petition, Arevalo \n18 asserts 20 claims for relief under the United States Constitution, the California \n19 Constitution, and various related statutes.12 \n20\n21\n \n22\n6  Petition ¶ 2. \n23\n7  Id. at ¶ 3. \n24 8  Id. at ¶ 4. \n25 9  Id. at ¶ 6. \n26 10  Id. \n27 11  See generally id. \n28 12  See generally id. \n-6- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 6     Filed 05/19/25     Page 7 of 13   Page ID\n#:175\n \n1   On the same day that Arevalo filed his Petition, he also filed the instant \n2 TRO Application and Class Certification Application.13  Through his TRO \n3 Application, Arevalo seeks the following elements of relief: \n4 •  to prevent the Government from removing Arevalo, or any member of the \n5 putative class, from the United States under Proclamation No. 10903; \n6 •  to prevent the Government from transferring Arevalo, or any member of \n7 the putative class, out of this judicial district; \n8 •  to require the Government to provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any \n9 removal or transfer out of this judicial district pursuant to Proclamation \n10 No. 10903; \n11 •  to provide Arevalo’s counsel with notice of the transfer into this judicial \n12 district of any person designated as an Alien Enemy under the \n13 Proclamation; and \n14 •  to require the Government reasonably to preserve all property and \n15 evidence that it possesses regarding Arevalo and any other member of the \n16 putative class and to provide that evidence to Arevalo’s counsel upon \n17 request.14 \n18 III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n19 A.  Ex Parte Application \n20   “The opportunities for legitimate ex parte applications are extremely \n21 limited.”  Lum v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 2012 WL 13012454, at *1 (C.D. Cal. \n22 Jan. 5, 2012).  To justify ex parte relief, the moving party must make two \n23 showings:  (1) “the evidence must show that the moving party’s cause will be \n24 irreparably prejudiced if the underlying motion is heard according to regular \n25 noticed motion procedures”; and (2) “it must be established that the moving \n26\n \n27 13  See TRO Application; Class Certification Application. \n28 14  See TRO Application. \n-7- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 6     Filed 05/19/25     Page 8 of 13   Page ID\n#:176\n \n1 party is without fault in creating the crisis that requires ex parte relief, or that the \n2 crisis occurred as a result of excusable neglect.”  Mission Power Engineering Co. v. \n3 Continental Cas. Co., 883 F. Supp. 488, 492 (C.D. Cal. 1995). \n4 B.  Rule 65—Temporary Restraining Order \n5   A party seeking a TRO or a preliminary injunction must establish four \n6 elements:  “(1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that the plaintiff will \n7 likely suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the \n8 balance of equities tip in its favor, and (4) that the public interest favors an \n9 injunction.”  Wells Fargo & Co. v. ABD Ins. & Fin. Servs., Inc., 758 F.3d 1069, \n10 1071 (9th Cir.), as amended (Mar. 11, 2014) (citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. \n11 Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  When the nonmoving party is a \n12 governmental entity, the last two Winter factors “merge.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 \n13 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \n14   If a plaintiff seeking to enjoin an alleged constitutional injury “shows he is \n15 likely to prevail on the merits,” then “that showing will almost always \n16 demonstrate he is suffering irreparable harm as well.”  Baird v. Bonta, 81 F.4th \n17 1036, 1042 (9th Cir. 2023).  “Accordingly, when an alleged deprivation of a \n18 constitutional right is involved, . . . most courts hold that no further showing of \n19 irreparable injury is necessary.”  Id. (quotation and brackets omitted).  Similarly, \n20 “[a] plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits of a constitutional claim also \n21 tips the merged third and fourth factors decisively in his favor” because “it is \n22 always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional \n23 rights.”  Id. (quotations omitted).  Thus, a plaintiff who has established that he \n24 is likely to succeed on the merits “ha[s] also established that both the public \n25 interest and the balance of the equities favor a preliminary injunction.”  Id. \n26   In the Ninth Circuit, “serious questions going to the merits and a balance \n27 of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a \n28 preliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a \n-8- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 6     Filed 05/19/25     Page 9 of 13   Page ID\n#:177\n \n1 likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.”  \n2 All. for Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal \n3 quotations omitted). \n4 C.  Rule 23—Class Certification \n5   The class action procedural vehicle is “an exception to the usual rule that \n6 litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.”  \n7 Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 348 (2011) (internal quotations \n8 omitted).  To certify a class, “plaintiffs must prove the facts necessary to carry \n9 the burden of establishing that the prerequisites of Rule 23 [of the Federal Rules \n10 of Civil Procedure] are satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence.”  Olean \n11 Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 665 (9th \n12 Cir. 2022) (en banc). \n13   Rule 23 governs class actions.  A party seeking class certification must \n14 establish all of the following: \n15 (1) the  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \n16 impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the \n17 class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \n18 typical  of  the  claims  or  defenses  of  the  class;  and  (4) the \n19 representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests \n20 of the class. \n21 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  After satisfying those four prerequisites—typically \n22 referred to as “numerosity,” “commonality,” “typicality,” and “adequacy”—\n23 a party must also demonstrate one of the following:  (1) a risk that separate \n24 actions would create incompatible standards of conduct for the defendant or \n25 prejudice individual class members not parties to the action; (2) the defendant \n26 has treated the members of the class as a class, making appropriate injunctive or \n27 declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or (3) common questions \n28 of law or fact predominate over questions affecting individual members and a \n-9- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 6     Filed 05/19/25     Page 10 of 13   Page ID\n#:178\n \n1 class action is a superior method for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the action.  \n2 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)-(3). \n3   A district court has broad discretion to grant or deny a motion for class \n4 certification.  See Bateman v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 623 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. \n5 2010).  However, “[a] party seeking class certification must affirmatively \n6 demonstrate compliance with [Rule 23]—that is, he must be prepared to prove \n7 that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or \n8 fact, etc.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350.  A district court must conduct a \n9 “rigorous analysis” that frequently “will entail some overlap with the merits of \n10 the plaintiff’s underlying claim.”  Id. at 351. \n11   Class certification “‘is inherently tentative,’” so “the judge remains free \n12 to modify it in the light of subsequent developments in the litigation.”  Gen. Tel. \n13 Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982) (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. \n14 Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469 n.11 (1978)).  Additionally, the district court may, \n15 within its discretion, amend the class definition, even sua sponte.  See, e.g., Davis \n16 v. Lab’y Corp. of Am. Holdings, 604 F. Supp. 3d 913, 934 n.16 (C.D. Cal. 2022), \n17 aff’d, 2024 WL 489288 (9th Cir. Feb. 8, 2024) (certifying a class with a \n18 definition different than what was proposed in the motion), cert. granted, 145 \n19 S. Ct. 1133 (2025); see also Davis, 2024 WL 489288, at *1 (noting that, after \n20 awarding class certification, “the district court amended  its class certification \n21 order to refine the class definitions”).  “This flexibility enhances the usefulness \n22 of the class-action device.”  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160. \n23 IV.  ANALYSIS \n24 A.  TRO Application \n25   Arevalo has satisfied all four elements necessary to obtain a TRO.  First, \n26 Arevalo is likely to succeed on the merits of his claims, insofar as those claims \n27 relate to the Government’s ability to remove detainees without notice that is \n28 sufficient to allow detainees to seek habeas relief prior to removal.  See J.G.G., \n-10- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 6     Filed 05/19/25     Page 11 of 13   Page ID\n#:179\n \n1 145 S. Ct. at 1006.  Second, in view of the Government’s representations in \n2 other cases regarding its ability to recover individuals who have been deported, \n3 Arevalo will likely suffer irreparable harm in the absence of immediate, \n4 temporary relief.  See A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1417281, at *2.  Finally, in view of the \n5 potential that constitutional deprivations may occur in the absence of immediate \n6 injunctive relief, the balance of the equities and public interest favor temporary \n7 injunctive relief.  See, e.g., Baird, 81 F.4th at 1042. \n8   Accordingly, Arevalo’s instant TRO Application is GRANTED in part.  \n9 The Government may not remove or transfer Arevalo out of this judicial district \n10 pursuant to Proclamation No. 10903 without providing prior notice, including \n11 and until further order of this Court regarding the amount of notice that is due.  \n12 See A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1417281, at *3; see also id. at *4 (Kavanaugh, J., \n13 concurring) (clarifying that injunctive relief is appropriate to “ensure[] that the \n14 Judiciary can decide whether these Venezuelan detainees may be lawfully \n15 removed under the Alien Enemies Act before they are in fact removed”) \n16 (emphasis in original). \n17 B.  Class Certification Application \n18   Arevalo also seeks to certify, on an immediate basis, a class consisting of \n19 the following: \n20 All noncitizens in custody in the Central District of California who \n21 were,  are,  or  will  be  subject  to  the  March  2025  Presidential \n22 Proclamation  entitled  “Invocation  of  the  Alien  Enemies  Act \n23 Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua” \n24 and/or its implementation.15 \n25   The Court views the Class Certification Application as controlled by the \n26 Supreme Court’s decision in A.A.R.P., 2025 WL 1417281.  There, the Supreme \n27\n \n28 15  Class Certification Application 1:26–28. \n-11- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 6     Filed 05/19/25     Page 12 of 13   Page ID\n#:180\n \n1 Court reversed the denial of a similar putative class and enjoined the \n2 Government from removing members of the putative class while the question of \n3 what notice was due was adjudicated.  See id. at *3.  In doing so, the Supreme \n4 Court appeared to conclude that, although it may be inappropriate to certify a \n5 class of detainees insofar as the class sought to challenge their removability on a \n6 classwide basis, it was appropriate to certify, on an emergency basis, a class that \n7 sought “to vindicate notice rights on a classwide basis.”  Id. at *3 n.1; see also id. \n8 at *3 (“Although the putative class members may ultimately take different steps \n9 to protect their own interests in response to such a notice, the notice to which \n10 they are entitled is the same.”). \n11   Accordingly, Arevalo’s Class Certification Application is GRANTED in \n12 part.  Pursuant to A.A.R.P., the Court certifies the above-identified class for the \n13 limited purpose of adjudicating the amount of notice due prior to removal under \n14 the AEA or Proclamation No. 10903. \n15 V.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15.  For the reasons explained \nDENIED\n5  below, Arevalo’s instant Application is  . \n6  I.  BACKGROUND \n7    The parties are familiar with the history of this case.  As relevant here, \n8  Arevalo is a Venezuelan citizen currently detained at the Desert View Annex or \n9  Desert View Modified Community Correctional Facility, which is associated \n10  with the Adelanto Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) Processing \n11  Center.2  Arevalo applied for asylum in the United States, and he was previously \n12  granted parole, which allowed him to work and reside in the United States \n13  pending the resolution of removal proceedings and his asylum application.3  \n14  During a scheduled ICE check-in, however, Arevalo was arrested and placed in \n15  detention.4  The Government did not provide Arevalo with prior notice of his \n16  arrest nor serve him with a warrant or other documentation regarding the basis \n17  for his arrest.5 \n18    Arevalo suspected that he may have been detained pursuant to \n19  Proclamation No. 10903 (the “Proclamation”), which authorized the immediate \n20  detention and removal of certain Venezuelan citizens.6  Thus, on Saturday, \n21 \n \n1  See Pet.-Pl.’s Emergency Ex Parte Appl. for a Writ of Habeas Corpus (the \n22 \n“Application”) [ECF No. 30]. \n23 \n2  Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Class Action Compl. for Decl. and \n24 \nInj.

LEGAL STANDARD \n13    “The opportunities for legitimate ex parte applications are extremely \n14  limited.”  Lum v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 2012 WL 13012454, at *1 (C.D. Cal. \n15  Jan. 5, 2012).  To justify ex parte relief, the moving party must make two \n16  showings:  (1) “the evidence must show that the moving party’s cause will be \n17  irreparably prejudiced if the underlying motion is heard according to regular \n18  noticed motion procedures”; and (2) “it must be established that the moving \n19  party is without fault in creating the crisis that requires ex parte relief, or that the \n20  crisis occurred as a result of excusable neglect.”  Mission Power Engineering Co. v. \n21  Continental Cas. Co., 883 F. Supp. 488, 492 (C.D. Cal. 1995). \n22 \n \n13  See Am.

ANALYSIS \n2    Arevalo argues that he is entitled to ex parte relief because, in view of the \n3  Immigration Order, the Government no longer has any legal basis to support \n4  Arevalo’s detention.18  In response, the Government asserts that it intends to \n5  appeal the Immigration Order in Arevalo’s case and that Arevalo is detained \n6  pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) pending the resolution of that appeal. \n7    Under that statute, “an alien who is an applicant for admission,” and for \n8  whom the Attorney General has commenced removal proceedings under 8 \n9  U.S.C. § 1229a, must remain detained “until removal proceedings have \n10  concluded.”  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 299 (2018).  And, because \n11  “[t]he Immigration Judge’s grant of relief in removal proceedings is not final [if] \n12  it has been appealed,” a removal proceeding has not concluded until such appeal \n13  has been decided.  Matter of E-Y-F-G-, 29 I.&N. Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2025).  \n14  Thus, an applicant may remain in custody pending any such appeal.  See Matter \n15  of M-S-, 27 I.&N. Dec. 509, 517 (BIA 2019). \n16    Arevalo does not appear to dispute that 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) \n17  authorizes the Government to detain an asylee pending the resolution of \n18  removal proceedings, and Arevalo does not contest the Government’s ability to \n19  appeal the Immigration Order.19  Nevertheless, Arevalo maintains that the \n20  Government’s authority to detain him ceased when the Immigration Order was \n21  entered for several reasons.  First, Arevalo asserts that the Immigration Judge \n22  “decided that he is ‘clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted’ by \n23  granting asylum” and that such decision is conclusive.20  But the Immigration \n24 \n \n25 \n18  See generally id. \n26 \n19  See Application; Pl.’s Reply in Support of the Application (the “Reply”) \n27  [ECF No. 39]. \n28  20  Reply 9:2-4 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A)). \n-6- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 40     Filed 06/20/25     Page 7 of 8   Page ID\n#:528\n \n1  Order contains no such finding, and Arevalo provides no authority to support \n2  the proposition that an appealable decision is somehow also a conclusive \n3  decision for the purpose of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A).21  Similarly, although \n4  Arevalo urges the Court to disregard the BIA’s precedents regarding the non-\n5  finality of asylum decisions, Arevalo provides no alternative authorities on which \n6  this Court could rely.22 \n7    Next, Arevalo argues that the Supreme Court’s decision in Jennings has \n8  been limited by other Supreme Court cases, including Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. \n9  785 (2022), and Johnson v. Arteaga-Martinez, 596 U.S. 573 (2022).  But it is \n10  unclear why Arevalo believes that either of those cases limits the Government’s \n11  authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1225.  In Biden, the Supreme Court addressed \n12  whether the Government was permitted, under a different provision of the INA, \n13  to terminate a program through which certain noncitizens were returned to \n14  Mexico.  See Biden, 597 U.S. at 790-91.  And in Johnson, the Supreme Court held \n15  that the Government is not required “to offer detained noncitizens bond \n16  hearings after six months of detention.”  Johnson, 596 U.S. at 576.  Neither \n17  decision limited or undermined Jennings or the Government’s authority under 8 \n18  U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A). \n19    Finally, Arevalo contends that the Supreme Court’s decision in \n20  Boumediene v. Bush, 523 U.S. 723 (2008), controls this case.23  But that position \n21  appears to arise out of Arevalo’s belief that the Government seeks a “functional \n22  suspension of the writ” of habeas corpus because the Government’s application \n23  of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) “would allow indefinite detention of immigrants \n24 \n25 \n \n26  21  See Immigration Order. \n27  22  See Reply 9:12-20. \n28  23  See id. at 7:10. \n-7- \n\nCase 5:25-cv-01207-JWH-PD     Document 40     Filed 06/20/25     Page 8 of 8   Page ID\n#:529",
