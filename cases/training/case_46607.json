The exemption previously allowed goods valued under $800 to be imported duty-free, significantly benefiting U.S. consumers and small businesses.</p>\r\n<p>On May 16, 2025, Axle of Dearborn, Inc. d/b/a Detroit Axle (Plaintiff), a Michigan-based, family-owned automotive parts distributor, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade against the Department of Commerce, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff alleged that executive orders issued by President Trump unlawfully eliminated the de minimis exemption codified at 19 U.S.C. &sect; 1321(a)(2)(C). Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing that the President's actions exceeded statutory authority, violated required procedural rules under 19 U.S.C. &sect; 1321(b), and were arbitrary and capricious.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to a three-judge panel composed of Judge Gary S. Katzmann, Judge Timothy M. Reif, and Judge Jane A. Restani.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff claimed that removing the exemption immediately subjected it to substantial tariffs and fees, threatening its viability. On May 21, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction and expedited partial summary judgment to reinstate the exemption, highlighting imminent, irreparable harm including potential facility closures and significant layoffs expected by late June 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 30, Defendants requested a stay pending resolution of related appeals in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/46396/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump</a></em> and <em><a href=\"../../../../case/46480/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of Oregon v. Trump</a></em>. Plaintiff opposed, citing ongoing irreparable harm.</p>\r\n<p>On July 28, the three-judge panel denied Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for a preliminary injunction and stayed the case pending final resolution of V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States in the Federal Circuit because any relief sought by plaintiff was already encompassed in the broader V.O.S. injunction, which was stayed on appeal. On September 9, the Supreme Court of the United States granted a writ of certiorari in V.O.S. Selections and consolidated it with <a href=\"../../../../case/46478/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 2025, Plaintiff filed a Motion to alter/amend/correct the Complaint. The proposed amendments updated the complaint to reflect Congress&rsquo; repeal of the de minimus exemption, not effective until July 2027, in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the President&rsquo;s July 30, 2025 Executive Order 14256 that eliminated the de minimis exemption worldwide, effective on August 29, 2025, with implementation by CBP. That same day, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Lift Stay and a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. As of October 8, these motions were pending and the case remained stayed.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case challenged President Trump’s removal of the de minimis exemption for low-value imports from China. The rule had previously allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. without paying tariffs, which had benefited small businesses and consumers.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 2025, Detroit Axle, a Michigan automotive parts company, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade against the Department of Commerce, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The company argued that President Trump’s executive orders removing the exemption were illegal because they exceeded his authority, ignored required procedures, and were arbitrary or unreasonable under the law. The case was assigned to a three-judge panel: Judges Gary S. Katzmann, Timothy M. Reif, and Jane A. Restani.\r\n\r\nDetroit Axle claimed that losing the exemption immediately increased tariffs on its imports, threatened its business, and put employees’ jobs at risk. On May 21, the company moved for a temporary restraining order and expedited consideration of a permanent injunction.\r\n\r\nOn May 30, the government requested a stay of the case while related appeals in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump and State of Oregon v. Trump were resolved. On July 28, the court denied Detroit Axle’s motion for a temporary order and stayed the case, finding that any relief sought was already encompassed by the ongoing V.O.S. case. The Supreme Court later granted certiorari in V.O.S. and consolidated it with Learning Resources, Inc. v.

J., June 25, 2025, ECF No. 27 (“Gov’t \nBr.”). \nDISCUSSION \nIn V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, this court vacated and permanently enjoined the \noperation of the executive orders (the “Trafficking Orders”) that purportedly deal with the threats \nposed by international cartels that “have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout \nthe Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with significant importance for \nour national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and \nvicious gangs.”  Executive Order 14157, Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign \nTerrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists, 90 Fed. Reg. 8439, 8439 (Jan. \n20, 2025); see also V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, 49 CIT __, __, 772 F. Supp. 3d 1350, \n1383 (2025).  The injunction this court issued in V.O.S. encompasses the Trafficking Orders \nimplicating the de minimis exemption at issue here.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit (“Federal Circuit”) has stayed that injunction pending appeal.  See V.O.S. Selections, Inc. \nv. Trump, Nos. 2025-1812, 2025-1813, 2025 WL 1649290 (Fed. Cir. June 10, 2025). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-3JP     Document 38      Filed 07/28/25      Page 3 of 4\nCourt No. 25-00091  Page 3 \nThough V.O.S. grants all the relief Axle seeks here, Axle brings the current action against \nDefendants the United States and certain agencies and officials (collectively, “the Government”) \nto independently challenge the President’s actions rescinding the de minimis exemption for goods \nfrom China.  See Compl., May 16, 2025, ECF No. 2.  This challenge would provide a separate \nbasis upon which Axle could seek relief should the appellate courts come to a different result \nregarding the Trafficking Orders in V.O.S. \nThe only way that Axle’s claim can succeed in any material sense is if that success falls \noutside the scope of the V.O.S. stay.  If the V.O.S. stay applies, then any preliminary injunction \nwe might issue would not confer a material benefit to Axle.  As a result, Axle likely cannot gain \nanything by its action that was not provided by the injunction this court granted in V.O.S. that has \nnow been stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. \nIn V.O.S. this court held that “[The International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n(“IEEPA”)] does not authorize the Trafficking [Orders] for the separate reason that they do not \nsatisfy the conditions that Congress imposed in 50 U.S.C. § 1701.”  49 CIT at __, 772 F. Supp. 3d \nat 1376.  That provision limits the President’s powers under IEEPA where: (1) there is a “threat[] \nwhich has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, \nforeign policy, or economy of the United States,” (2) that threat is “unusual and extraordinary,” \n(3) a national emergency is declared with respect to that threat, and (4) the President’s exercise of \nIEEPA authority “deal[s] with” that threat.  50 U.S.C. § 1701(a).  The Trafficking Orders are ultra \nvires because they “do not ‘deal with’ their stated objectives,” but instead “aim to create leverage \nto ‘deal with’ those objectives.”  V.O.S., 49 CIT at __, 772 F. Supp. 3d at 1381; see also Order \nHolding Mots. to Stay in Abeyance, June 3, 2025, ECF No. 63, V.O.S. Selections, Inc v. United \nStates, Case No. 25-00066 (Ct. Int’l Trade) (“The injunction issued on account of Plaintiffs’ \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-3JP     Document 38      Filed 07/28/25      Page 4 of 4\nCourt No. 25-00091  Page 4 \nsuccess on the merits and the unavailability under the Uniformity Clause of a complete legal \nremedy in the form of piecemeal duty refunds to specific plaintiffs.  Intrinsic to this exercise of \nequitable discretion was the compelling public interest in ‘ensuring that governmental bodies \ncomply with the law,’ and the lack of any cognizable hardship borne by the United States in the \nform of its non-enforcement of orders issued ultra vires.” (quoting Am. Signature, Inc. v. United \nStates, 598 F.3d 816, 830 (Fed. Cir. 2010))).  Axle now argues that several of the Trafficking \nOrders—those that implicate the de minimis exemption—are separately ultra vires because “the \nExecutive Branch has no authority to reduce the exemption below the $800 floor that Congress \ncreated, and (2) even if the Executive Branch could create exceptions that reduce the exemption \nbelow the $800 floor, it could do so only through notice-and-comment rulemaking.”  See Pl.’s Br. \nat 14 (emphasis removed). \nEven assuming arguendo that Axle is suffering irreparable harm, it cannot succeed in \nobtaining the relief it seeks.  This court has already granted, and the Federal Circuit subsequently \nstayed,  all  relief  Axle  requests.    We  will  not  grant  redundant,  contingent  relief  through  a \npreliminary injunction here. \nBecause this court will not provide additional relief, Axle’s motion for a preliminary \ninjunction  is  DENIED  and  the  case,  including  the  Government’s  outstanding  motions,  is \nSTAYED pending a final resolution of V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, 49 CIT __, __, \n772 F. Supp. 3d 1350 (2025), appeal docketed, 2025-1812 (Fed. Cir.). \nSO ORDERED. \nBy the panel. \n \nDated: July 28, 2025 \n  New York, New York ",

D/B/A DETROIT AXLE, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \n \nCase No. 1:25-cv-00091\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE; HOWARD LUTNICK, \nin his official capacity as Secretary of \nCOMPLAINT  \nCommerce; DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND\nSECURITY; KRISTI NOEM, in her official capacity \nas Secretary of Homeland Security; \nTHREE-JUDGE COURT \nDEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY; SCOTT REQUESTED \nBESSENT, in his official capacity as Secretary of \nthe Treasury; UNITED STATES CUSTOMS AND\nBORDER PROTECTION; PETE R. FLORES, in his \nofficial capacity as Acting Commissioner for \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection; and the \nUNITED STATES, \nDefendants. \nCOMPLAINT \nPlaintiff Detroit Axle alleges as follows: \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1. Detroit Axle is a family-run retailer and distributor of auto parts.  Through thirty-\nfive years of hard work and ingenuity, and with the help of longstanding U.S. laws and policies \npromoting free trade, the company has transformed from a local Rust Belt supplier to a national \nInternet-based dealer with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales.  But as a result of recent \ndrastic and unlawful changes in trade policy, this American success story—and the jobs of its \nhundreds of U.S. employees in Michigan—could be wiped out in a matter of months.  This Court’s \nimmediate intervention is needed to keep the business running.  \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 2 of 34\n2.  Detroit Axle grew into a nationwide distributor at the turn of the millennium.  By \nleveraging e-marketplaces as a distribution channel, the company has been able to reach a national \ncustomer base primarily consisting of individuals who want to make repairs or improvements to \ntheir vehicles on a budget.  Detroit Axle’s business now depends on delivering auto parts to these \ncost-conscious customers quickly and at low prices.     \n3.  Detroit Axle’s rapid growth relied on U.S. policy—as reflected in congressional \nstatutes and low-tariff trade agreements—that encouraged mutually beneficial international trade.  \nDetroit Axle has contracted with manufacturers in China that can produce auto parts more cheaply \nthan can American manufacturers and can produce parts that are not made by any American man-\nufacturers—enabling Detroit Axle to reach more customers with lower prices.  This arrangement \nhas allowed the company to better serve its U.S. customers and grow its U.S. business.  The com-\npany’s Michigan facilities now employ hundreds of American workers. \n4.  Beginning in 2018, however, the United States began pulling back from its free-\ntrade commitments.  Between 2018 and 2020, for example, the President imposed significant tar-\niffs on Chinese goods, including the Chinese auto parts imported by Detroit Axle. \n5.  With limited ability to raise its prices while maintaining its thrifty customer base, \nDetroit Axle turned to a pillar of U.S. free-trade policy—the statutory de minimis exemption.  \n19 U.S.C. § 1321(a)(2)(C).  Enacted in 1938, the de minimis exemption spares low-value im-\nports—today, imports of $800 or less—from tariffs.  The exemption “provide[s] significant eco-\nnomic benefits to businesses and consumers in the United States . . . through cost savings and \nreductions in trade transaction costs.”  Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA), \nPub. L. No. 114-125, § 901(a)(2), 130 Stat. 122, 223 (2016). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 3 of 34\n6.  To achieve those efficiencies and savings, Detroit Axle opened a second distribu-\ntion facility in Juarez, Mexico.  That facility imports auto parts from China and promptly sells \nthem to U.S. customers west of the Mississippi River, while the Detroit facility primarily serves \nthe remainder of the country.  Because Detroit Axle only fulfills orders of less than $800 from the \nMexico distribution center, all of Detroit Axle’s sales from that facility are exempt from tariffs on \nChinese goods under the de minimis exemption. \n7.  The new facility has been a lifeline for the company.  It has allowed Detroit Axle \nto essentially cut in half the effects of the increased Chinese tariffs by splitting imports between \nits two facilities, which in turn lets the company maintain lower prices for all of its customers and \nincrease its investments in Michigan.  Indeed, since opening the Mexico facility, Detroit Axle has \nopened a second facility in Michigan and grown its Michigan workforce significantly, while ex-\npanding its original Michigan operation. \n8.  But Detroit Axle now faces an existential threat.  Relying on the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—a statute traditionally used to impose economic sanc-\ntions on pariah nations like North Korea—the President has declared a series of national emergen-\ncies and levied unprecedented global tariffs on American companies like Detroit Axle.   \n9.  Most relevant here, on May 2, 2025, the President purported to eliminate the stat-\nutory de minimis exemption for Chinese imports—which has the effect of subjecting Detroit \nAxle’s shipments from its Mexico facility (comprising products from China) to all preexisting \ntariffs, including certain tariffs under IEEPA. \n10.  The impact on Detroit Axle has been swift and catastrophic.  Under the now-ap-\nplicable Chinese tariffs, which have reached 72.5%, it is cost-prohibitive for Detroit Axle to import \nparts from its suppliers in China to its Detroit factory.  Its frugal buyers will not bear the increased \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 4 of 34\nprices, and Detroit Axle cannot absorb them.  Nor can Detroit Axle continue to blunt the impact \nof the tariffs by selling parts from its Mexico facility, given the purported elimination of the de \nminimis exemption.  Thus, by the end of June, the company will exhaust its existing inventory and \nwill be forced to close the doors of its Michigan facilities and lay off hundreds of employees.   \n11.  The government’s actions inflicting these irreparable harms are unlawful on three \nindependent grounds.    \n12.  First, the abrogation of the de minimis exemption exceeds the President’s statu-\ntory authority.  Congress established an $800 floor for the de minimis exemption by statute, and \nthat statute does not allow the President or any other executive official to suspend or eliminate the \nexemption by administrative fiat.  Rather, if the $800 floor is alterable at all, it may be changed \nonly through notice-and-comment rulemaking by the Secretary of the Treasury, which has not \noccurred here.  See 19 U.S.C. § 1321(b).  Nor does IEEPA give the President authority to modify \nthe exemption.  Even if IEEPA authorized tariffs—and it does not, as discussed below—that stat-\nute’s general provisions for dealing with economic emergencies could not be used to override \nSection 1321’s specific requirements with respect to the de minimis exemption.  \n13.  Second, agency actions purporting to nullify the de minimis exemption—like the \nfinal notice that “duty-free de minimis treatment . . . shall no longer be available for products of \nthe PRC,”  90 Fed. Reg. 17,608, 17,609 (Apr. 28, 2025)—are arbitrary and capricious in violation \nof the Administrative Procedure Act.  The exemption has been the law of the United States for \nnearly a century.  As such, it has engendered serious, investment-backed reliance interests—as \nDetroit Axle’s investments demonstrate.  Yet in reversing course and overriding the de minimis \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 5 of 34\nexemption, the government violated bedrock APA principles by failing to consider these signifi-\ncant reliance interests, failing to consider other important aspects of the problem, and offering no \nreasoned explanation for its actions. \n14.  Third, the IEEPA tariffs applicable to Detroit Axle are unlawful.  IEEPA is not a \nblank check.  It grants the President authority to “regulate” the “importation or exportation” of \nforeign property to respond to emergencies based on “unusual and extraordinary threat[s].”  \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1701–02.  But it does not grant the power to levy tariffs on Americans—a highly \nconsequential taxing power that the Constitution textually commits to Congress alone and that \nCongress has jealously guarded and only narrowly delegated.  At a minimum, the kind of unilateral \ncontrol that the President is asserting over the U.S. economy under IEEPA is of the utmost “eco-\nnomic and political significance” and thus would require clear authorization, which is lacking here.  \nUtil. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, any \nreading of IEEPA that would grant the President the power he claims—power to levy any tariffs \nhe wants, on any country, for any period of time—would be an unconstitutional delegation of \nCongress’s tariff power.  And the implementation of the President’s orders is also arbitrary and \ncapricious.  \n15.  This Court should enjoin the government from enforcing the President’s purported \nabrogation of the de minimis exemption and from implementing the IEEPA tariffs. \nPARTIES \n16.

Detroit Axle Is A Family-Owned American Success Story. \n28.  Detroit Axle was founded as a family-owned business in Dearborn, Michigan in \n1990.  At that time, it assembled and sold a single automotive part, the CV-joint, to local mechan-\nics.  At first, Detroit Axle had no effective way to reach the broader American consumer:  While \nchain auto-parts stores benefited from locations throughout the country and the name recognition \nthat came with them, Detroit Axle had operations in a single Rust Belt suburb.   \n29.  Starting in the mid-2000s, however, Detroit Axle was able to increase the size and \ngeographic scope of its business significantly by leveraging e-commerce.  Detroit Axle started \nselling its products nationwide on e-marketplaces like Amazon and eBay to small mechanics, car \nenthusiasts in search of hard-to-find parts, and thrifty do-it-yourself car owners.   \n30.  In time, the Rust Belt bootstrapper became a genuine competitor to its bigger \ncounterparts, while remaining family-owned and operated.  And Detroit Axle’s rising tide lifted \nother boats—customers across the country enjoyed lower prices, and Dearborn, Michigan bene-\nfited from the new jobs Detroit Axle created, many of which the company gave to formerly incar-\ncerated individuals in need of work.   \nII.  Detroit Axle’s Business Relies On Longstanding U.S. Free-Trade Laws And Policies. \n31.  Detroit Axle also owes its success to U.S. policies encouraging international trade.  \nSince the Smoot-Hawley Act imposed tariffs that contributed to the Great Depression, the Nation’s \nforeign policy has been roundly pro-trade.  See Daniel Griswold & Clark Packard, How Trade \nAgreements Have Enhanced the Freedom and Prosperity of Americans, CATO Institute (Aug. 27, \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 8 of 34\n2024), https://tinyurl.com/97vashc6.  In the immediate post-war era, the United States helped ne-\ngotiate the founding document of the World Trade Organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade.  Id.  And since the mid-twentieth century, the United States has negotiated 20 bilateral \nfree-trade agreements, including 12 since 1992.  See id. (“Since NAFTA, the United States has \nsigned and implemented 12 agreements with 17 countries”).  The policy of the United States for \ndecades has been one of low (or no) tariffs.  See id. (38% of U.S. imports in 2023 came from \ncountries on which the U.S. imposes no tariffs); see also Christopher A. Casey, Cong. Rsch. Serv., \nU.S. Tariff Policy: Overview 2 (Jan. 31, 2025) (noting that “[s]ince 1934, the United States has \nreduced or eliminated many tariffs as part of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements” and that \nthis period has been marked by “[l]ow U.S. tariff rates”). \n32.  Detroit Axle’s business has flourished from free trade.  To better serve its core \ncustomers—individuals hoping to improve or repair their vehicles on a budget—Detroit Axle con-\ntracted with Chinese factories that produce parts either not made by or made more cheaply than \nU.S. manufacturers.  Even while doing so, Detroit Axle maintained and increased the size of its \nAmerican employee base, because with cheaper products came more orders, which required more \nU.S. workers to ship the parts. \n33.  In recent years, however, the Executive Branch began to retreat from the United \nStates’ commitment to free trade.  In 2018 and 2020, it imposed tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese-\nmanufactured goods under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. § 2411.  Certain auto \nparts, in particular, were subject to tariffs of up to 25%.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 28,710 (June 20, 2018) \n(List 1); 83 Fed. Reg. 40,823 (Aug. 16, 2018) (List 2); 83 Fed. Reg. 47,974 (Sept. 21, 2018) \n(List 3); 84 Fed. Reg. 43,304 (Aug. 20, 2019) (List 4).   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 9 of 34\n34.  With thin margins, Detroit Axle had limited ability to withstand these tariffs.  So in \nan effort to keep its business viable, the company turned to another mainstay of U.S. free-trade \npolicy—the statutory de minimis exemption.  Through that nearly 90-year-old statute, Congress \nhas eliminated tariffs on certain low-value imports.  Customs Administrative Act of 1938, Pub. L. \nNo. 75-721, § 7, 52 Stat. 1077, 1081 (1938).  Although originally enacted to avoid the administra-\ntive inconvenience of collecting tariffs on goods worth less than $1, the de minimis exemption has, \nat Congress’s direction, expanded and evolved over the decades into a powerful tool for enhancing \nfree trade.  Today, the statute requires the government to exempt from tariffs goods worth “not \nless than” $800 per person per day.  19 U.S.C. § 1321(a)(2)(C).   \n35.  As Congress has explained, expanding the de minimis exemption in this way “pro-\nvide[s] significant economic benefits to businesses and consumers in the United States . . . through \ncosts savings and reductions in trade transaction costs.”  TFTEA, § 901(a)(2), 130 Stat. at 223.  It \nhas played an instrumental role in providing Americans easy access to low-cost goods over the \nInternet.  And American exporters have benefited as well, as the United States has successfully \nurged other countries to reciprocate and adopt their own de minimis exemptions.  CRS Report, \nImports & Section 321, supra, at 20–21. \n36.  In 2020, to utilize this exemption, Detroit Axle opened a distribution center in Jua-\nrez, Mexico, just across the U.S.-Mexico border.  From that facility, which also imports auto parts \nfrom China, Detroit Axle can sell and deliver goods directly to U.S. customers.  And because \nDetroit Axle only fulfills orders of less than $800 from the Mexico distribution center, all of Detroit \nAxle’s sales from that facility were, until recently, exempt from tariffs under the de minimis ex-\nemption. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 10 of 34\n37.  Detroit Axle’s Mexico facility has been essential to maintaining and growing its \nbusiness.  In e-commerce, speed and efficiency are paramount, and through this second location, \nDetroit Axle has been able to better serve its customers and capture market share by shipping more \nquickly to the western United States.  The Mexico facility also allows Detroit Axle to cushion the \nfinancial impact of the tariffs on its Dearborn, Michigan distribution center, which continues to \nserve customers east of the Mississippi River.  Indeed, the increased revenue from its Mexico \nlocation has allowed Detroit Axle to increase the size of its operations in America—in a virtuous \ncycle, as shipment sizes went up, the price per unit fell, allowing Detroit Axle to open a re-manu-\nfacturing plant and employ even more people in Michigan. \n38.  The Mexico facility also has helped Detroit Axle become a top third-party seller on \nAmazon and eBay.  As a top seller, Detroit Axle consistently appears at or near the top of search \nresults when customers search for auto parts on these marketplaces—which is critical to driving \nsales and maintaining market share. \n39.  The de minimis exemption thus has functioned just as Congress intended by allow-\ning Detroit Axle to keep its prices low, sell more goods to more customers, and expand its business \nby hiring additional employees. \nIII.  The  President’s  Tariff  Orders  Have  Purported  To  Abrogate  The  De  Minimis \nExemption. \n40.  Since February 2025, the President has issued numerous executive orders imposing \ntariffs.  Initially, the President imposed tariffs just on China, Mexico, and Canada, purportedly to \ndeal with the flow of fentanyl; these tariffs remain in force but have been amended several times.  \nSince then, the President has levied more sweeping tariffs on virtually every country in the world—\ntariffs he has altered significantly and unpredictably.  These actions have moved markets, reshaped \nglobal shipping patterns, and begun to rewire the U.S. and global economies. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 11 of 34\n41.  The President has purported to impose almost all of these tariffs under the Interna-\ntional Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et. seq.  Enacted in 1977, IEEPA au-\nthorizes the President to take certain actions with respect to foreign property to “deal with” “unu-\nsual and extraordinary threat[s]” arising abroad.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1701–02.  Presidents have his-\ntorically used IEEPA to impose economic sanctions on state sponsors of terrorism and pariah na-\ntions, such as Iran and North Korea.  Until this year, no President has used IEEPA to impose tariffs. \n42.  In these tariff orders, the President also purported to eliminate the statutory de min-\nimis exemption for goods imported from China.  The President initially abrogated the exemption \non February 1, 2025, before pausing that order days later until the Secretary of Commerce notified \nhim that “adequate” systems were in place to collect tariffs.  See Exec. Order No. 14195, § 2(g), \n90 Fed. Reg. 9,121, 9,123 (Feb. 1, 2025); Exec. Order No. 14200, § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,277, 9,277 \n(Feb. 5, 2025).  After being so notified, the President issued a further order providing that “duty-\nfree de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) shall no longer be available” for “prod-\nucts of” China starting on May 2, 2025.  Exec. Order No. 14256, § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. 14,899, 14,899 \n(Apr. 2, 2025).  That order went into effect on May 2.  See 90 Fed. Reg. 17,608, 17,609 (Apr. 28, \n2025) (notifying the public that DHS would no longer allow the de minimis exemption for products \nof China beginning May 2). \n43.  As a result of the President’s purported abrogation of the de minimis exemption for \nChinese imports, Detroit Axle’s direct-to-consumer auto-parts shipments from its Mexico facility \nare now subject to a wide array of burdensome tariffs applicable to Chinese imports.1  Under \n \n1 Even though many of Detroit Axle’s products pass through Mexico, they are tariffed as though \nthey are Chinese goods because they are not “substantially transformed” in Mexico.  See 19 C.F.R. \n§ 134.1(b) (defining the “Country of origin” and requiring a “substantial transformation” to alter \nthe initial country of origin).  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 12 of 34\nIEEPA, the President’s fentanyl-related orders have levied a total of 20% tariffs on Chinese goods, \nincluding auto parts.  See Exec. Order No. 14195, § 2(a); Exec. Order No. 14228, § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. \n11,463, 11,463 (Mar. 3, 2025).  The President has also imposed auto-part-specific tariffs under \nSection 232 and Section 301.  The tariffs under Section 232 place an across-the-board 25% tariff \non auto parts, see Proclamation No. 10908, § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. 14,705, 14,706 (Mar. 26, 2025), \nwhile the Section 301 tariffs from the President’s first term vary but can go up to 25%, see supra \n¶ 34  (The worldwide “reciprocal tariffs,” by contrast, do not presently apply to auto parts subject \nto Section 232 tariffs.  Exec. Order No. 14257, § 3(b), 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041, 15,045–46 (Apr. 2, \n2025).) \n44.  Thus, Detroit Axle is subject to a 72.5% tariff on auto parts that it imports from \nChina, including by way of its Mexico facility: 25% from the Section 232 tariffs; 20% from the \nIEEPA fentanyl-related tariffs; 25% on China-origin auto parts under Section 301; plus a 2.5% \nMost Favored Nation duty on auto parts.2  \nIV.  The New Tariff Policies Threaten Detroit Axle’s Survival. \n45.  As is well-documented by now, the President’s actions have significantly impacted \nglobal markets.  For Detroit Axle, these actions threaten financial ruin:  Try as it might, the mas-\nsively increased costs resulting from the tariffs mean that Detroit Axle is likely to be forced to \nclose the doors of its Michigan facilities and lay off its employees by the end of June.   \n46.  Most immediately, the elimination of the de minimis exemption—and the corre-\nsponding imposition of 72.5% tariffs on auto parts shipped from its Mexico facility—have forced \nDetroit Axle bring its operations in Mexico to a near standstill, trapping tens of millions of dollars \n \n2 The “Most Favored Nation” tariff is a general duty imposed on goods from all countries.  See \ngenerally  Harmonized  Tariff  Schedule,  §  XVII,  ch.  87,  https://www.usitc.gov/publica-\ntions/docs/tata/hts/bychapter/1000c87.pdf (providing the HTSUS table for tariffs applicable to \nauto parts and certain vehicles).   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 13 of 34\nof inventory there.  Detroit Axle cannot simply pass 72.5% tariffs onto customers because many \nof its competitors do not have to raise their prices commensurately:  Many competitors either (1) \nsource their products from countries other than China and therefore are still able to utilize the de \nminimis exemption; or (2) are Chinese suppliers that utilize the postal service and therefore incur \nlower tariff rates (see infra ¶ 71).  And although Detroit Axles is absorbing the tariffs as a stopgap \nmeasure for the few products it continues to sell from Mexico, it cannot continue to do so for long.  \nThus, unless the exemption is restored, Detroit Axle’s business model will cease to be viable, and \nits Mexico facility—and Detroit Axle’s significant investments in it—will lose much of its value. \n47.  To try to keep prices low, Detroit Axle has been forced to fill orders almost entirely \nfrom the pre-tariff inventory it has stockpiled in its Michigan distribution center.  When the recent \ntariff increases began and the de minimis exemption was eliminated, Detroit Axle had limited \nreserve supplies in Michigan that it could use to fill orders.  That stock, however, likely will be \nexhausted by the end of June. \n48.  Once Detroit Axle has depleted its existing U.S. stockpiles, the economics of its \nbusiness will no longer make sense.  Detroit Axle will be forced to close its Michigan operations, \nlay off hundreds of employees, and try to sell off its remaining inventory in the Mexico facility at \nhigher prices.  The company would become a shell of itself. \n49.  Even if the company could eventually find new suppliers outside of China and re-\nstart the business, it likely would never achieve its former level of success.  Even a short period of \ndormancy likely would cost Detroit Axle its top-seller status on critical e-marketplaces like Ama-\nzon and eBay.  That in turn would cause the company to drop in the search results, making it \nexceedingly difficult (if not impossible) to regain its lost market share and support the infrastruc-\nture it has built over decades. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 14 of 34\n50.  Finally, while customer orders continue to arrive and Detroit Axle remains able to \nfill them with its reserves for the time being, running the entire business out of Michigan is causing \nsubstantial harm to the company by delaying deliveries to customers.  The Michigan facility does \nnot have sufficient employees to keep pace with the flow of orders that used to be handled by the \ncompany’s two warehouses—even with many existing employes working eighty-hour weeks (and \nbeing paid overtime wages).  And once orders are fulfilled, it takes longer to ship the goods from \nMichigan to the West Coast.  These delays have cost Detroit Axle sales and customer goodwill \nthat it has built over decades, which likewise threatens Detroit Axle’s position as a top seller on e-\nmarketplaces. \n51.  Thus, while Detroit Axle has remained afloat through a combination of ingenuity \nand grit, the dramatically increased tariffs and abrogation of the de minimis exemption make it \nonly a matter of time before Detroit Axle’s American success story will end. \nGROUNDS FOR RELIEF \nI.  The Executive Branch’s Abrogation Of The De Minimis Exemption Is Unlawful. \n52.  The President’s orders purporting to eliminate the de minimis exemption, and the \ngovernment’s implementation of those orders, are unlawful.  First, the Executive Branch lacks \nauthority to unilaterally override the $800 floor for the de minimis exemption that Congress has \nestablished by statute.  Second, the government’s actions implementing the President’s orders are \narbitrary and capricious because, among other reasons, the government failed to consider the reli-\nance interests of those, like Detroit Axle, that have made significant investments based on the de \nminimis exemption.  The President’s orders and the government’s actions enforcing them therefore \nshould be declared unlawful, enjoined, and set aside. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 15 of 34\nA.  The  Executive  Branch  Lacks  Authority  To  Rescind  The  De  Minimis \nExemption.  \n53.  The government’s attempt to nullify the de minimis exemption is unlawful because \nit circumvents the only statutorily prescribed means by which the Executive Branch conceivably \ncould alter the exemption:  notice-and-comment rulemaking.  See 19 U.S.C. § 1321(b). \n1.  Congress Has Established A Mandatory $800 Floor For The De \nMinimis Exemption. \n54.  The de minimis exemption relieves small-value imports from tariffs.  As originally \nenacted in 1938, the statute authorized “[c]ollectors of customs . . . under such regulations as the \nSecretary of the Treasury may prescribe, to disregard” duties on goods whose value did “not ex-\nceed . . . $1” when “the expense and inconvenience of collecting the duty accruing thereon would \nbe disproportionate to the amount of such duty.”  Customs Administrative Act of 1938, § 7, \n52 Stat. at 1081.  Since its adoption, Congress has repeatedly expanded the de minimis exemption.  \nSee, e.g., Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-410, \n§ 205(b)(3), 92 Stat. 888, 900 (1978) (raising the cap to $5).   \n55.  In 1993, “Congress fundamentally changed the language of the statute to further \nmake it a tool useful for trade liberalization by essentially requiring that the Secretary provide de \nminimis treatment.”  CRS Report, Imports & Section 321, supra, at 17.  Before 1993, the statute \nauthorized the Secretary of the Treasury to admit articles free of tariffs, but specified that the ag-\ngregate value of duty-free articles “shall not exceed” certain monetary thresholds.  See, e.g., \n19 U.S.C. § 1321 (1992).  But in 1993, Congress replaced “shall not exceed” with “shall not ex-\nceed an amount specified by the Secretary by regulation, but not less than” certain monetary \nthresholds.  North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. No. 103-182, \n§ 651, 107 Stat. 2057, 2209 (1993) (emphasis added).  Thus, whereas the Secretary before had the \nauthority to exempt goods up to $5 from tariffs per importer per day, the amended statute required \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 16 of 34\nthe Secretary to exempt at least $200 of goods per importer per day and authorized the Secretary \nto increase that floor by regulation.  Id. \n56.  In 2015, Congress further expanded the de minimis exemption by directing the \nTreasury Secretary to raise the value of duty-free goods to “not less than . . . $800” per importer \nper day.  19 U.S.C. § 1321(a)(2)(C); see TFTEA, § 901(a)(2), 130 Stat. at 223; 19 C.F.R. § 10.151 \n(permitting port directors to allow in shipments “not exceeding $800” duty free).  In so doing, \nCongress explained that “[h]igher thresholds for the value of articles that may be entered infor-\nmally and free of duty provide significant economic benefits to businesses and consumers in the \nUnited States and the economy of the United States.”  TFTEA, § 901(a)(2), 130 Stat. at 223.   \n57.  As discussed, this expansion of the de minimis exemption has allowed businesses \nlike Detroit Axle to import more goods without being penalized by tariffs, to the benefit of Amer-\nican workers and consumers.  See supra ¶¶ 32–40. \n58.  Section 1321 provides only one source of exception-making authority:  “The Sec-\nretary of the Treasury is authorized by regulations to prescribe exceptions to any exemption pro-\nvided for in subsection (a) whenever he finds that such action is consistent with the purpose of \nsubsection (a) or is necessary for any reason to protect the revenue or to prevent unlawful impor-\ntations.”  19 U.S.C. § 1321(b) (emphasis added).  That provision does not authorize the Treasury \nSecretary to make exceptions below the statutorily fixed floor.  See Nat’l Customs Brokers & For-\nwarders Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. United States, 59 F.3d 1219, 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (“section 1321 \nrequired Customs to set the dollar limit on duty-free entry at or above the specified minimum \nlevel”).  But even if it did, any exceptions must be made by the Secretary through notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking.  The Secretary recently initiated two rulemakings pursuant to his authority \nunder Section 1321(b), neither of which proposes eliminating the de minimis exception for nearly \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 17 of 34\nall Chinese goods.  90 Fed. Reg. 3,048, 3,072–73 (Jan. 14, 2025); 90 Fed. Reg. 6,852, 6,873 (Jan. \n21, 2025).   \n2.  The Executive Branch Has No Power To Nullify The Mandatory De \nMinimis Exemption. \n59.  Notwithstanding the mandatory, statutory nature of the de minimis exemption, the \nPresident has decreed by executive order that “duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. \n§ 1321(a)(2)(C) shall no longer be available for products of [China].”  Exec. Order No. 14256, § 1.  \nAnd he has ordered that the Secretary of Commerce take steps to do the same for imports from \nMexico.  See Exec. Order No. 14194, § 2(g), 90 Fed. Reg. 9,117, 9,119 (Feb. 1, 2025) (purporting \nto rescind the de minimis exemption for Mexico); Exec. Order No. 14227, § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. \n11,371, 11,371 (Mar. 2, 2025) (temporarily pausing the rescission). \n60.  Section 1321 forecloses any Executive Branch authority to abrogate the de minimis \nexemption.  The statute’s $800 floor is mandatory.  Congress specifically changed the exemption \nin 1993 to make it a floor rather than a ceiling in order to remove executive discretion and create \na safe harbor for free trade.  The President cannot override that considered judgment. \n61.  At a minimum, though, the President cannot alter the exemption by executive order.  \nSection 1321 prescribes one—and only one—source of exception-making authority: notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking.  A “situation in which a statute authorizes specific action and designates a \nparticular party empowered to take it is surely among the least appropriate in which to presume \nnonexclusivity.”  Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6 \n(2000); see Cont’l Cas. Co. v. United States, 314 U.S. 527, 533 (1942) (a “‘legislative affirmative \ndescription’ implies denial of the nondescribed powers”); 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction \n§ 47:23 (7th ed.) (describing expressio unius canon of statutory construction).  So if the Executive \nBranch has authority at all to disturb the judgment of Congress that the de minimis exemption is \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 18 of 34\nbeneficial to American consumers and businesses, it must do so through the notice-and-comment \nrulemaking that Congress specifically authorized.  \n62.  Nothing in IEEPA is to the contrary.  IEEPA grants the President the general au-\nthority to “regulate . . . importation of” foreign property to “deal with” certain emergencies.  \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1701–02.  That general grant of authority cannot be interpreted to give the President \npower to create at will new exceptions to the de minimis exemption, because it is a “commonplace \nof statutory construction that the specific governs the general.”  RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. \nAmalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012) (quotation marks omitted).  That rule of construc-\ntion has “particula[r]” force “where . . . ‘Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and has \ndeliberately targeted specific problems with specific solutions.’”  Id. \n63.  Here, Section 1321 creates a specific and comprehensive scheme governing the de \nminimis exemption; IEEPA speaks generally about regulating imports.  So even if IEEPA author-\nized the President to impose tariffs or revoke tariff exemptions—which it does not, as explained \nbelow—Congress’s clear instructions in Section 1321 would control.  The Executive Branch can-\nnot use IEEPA to circumvent Section 1321’s limitations. \n64.  Because the executive orders purporting to rescind the de minimis exemption are \n“incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress,” the President’s power is at its \n“lowest ebb,” and the President can claim to overcome the will of Congress only if his power over \ntariff exemptions is “conclusive and preclusive.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U.S. 579, \n637–38 (Jackson, J., concurring).  It is not.  Congress, not the President, has the constitutional \nauthority “to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 19 of 34\nB.  The Executive Branch’s Abrogation Of The De Minimis Exemption Was \nArbitrary And Capricious. \n65.  The Administrative Procedure Act forbids “arbitrary” and “capricious” agency ac-\ntion.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  To satisfy the arbitrary-and-capricious standard, agency action must \nbe “reasonable and reasonably explained.”  Ohio v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024) \n(quotation marks omitted).  Agency action is not reasonable or reasonably explained if the agency \n“entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its de-\ncision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be \nascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of \nU.S.. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  In considering “important aspect[s]” \nof a problem, it “would be arbitrary and capricious to ignore” the impact that a change in \n“longstanding policies may have” on “serious reliance interests.”  DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of \nCal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (quotation marks omitted).  The government also must consider “al-\nternative way[s] of achieving” its objectives and give “adequate reasons” to reject them.  State \nFarm, 463 U.S. at 48.  \n66.  Although the President’s actions are not directly subject to APA review, agency \naction implementing an executive order is not “insulate[d] . . . from judicial review under the APA, \neven if the validity of the Order were thereby drawn into question.”  Chamber of Com. v. Reich, \n74 F.3d 1322, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Rather, courts “have subjected agency actions that incorpo-\nrate a presidential directive to APA review (and specifically to arbitrary-or-capricious review).”  \nState v. Su, 121 F.4th 1, 15–16 (9th Cir. 2024). \n67.  On April 28, 2025, DHS issued a notice that it would begin to collect tariffs on \ngoods that otherwise would qualify for de minimis treatment on May 2, including goods from \nChina valued less than $800.  See 90 Fed. Reg. 17,608, 17,609 (Apr. 28, 2025).  This and other \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 20 of 34\nfinal agency actions implementing the rescission of the de minimis exemption are arbitrary and \ncapricious.  See, e.g., Customs & Border Prot., Executive Order – Tariff on De Minimis Shipments \nfrom China, Article No. 000001915 (May 8, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/6kj36jys.   \n68.  The Executive Branch has provided a barebones explanation for its abrogation of \nthe de minimis exemption:  “[S]hippers often avoid detection [of narcotics] due to administration \nof the de minimis exemption.”  Exec. Order No. 14256, § 1.  That explanation is insufficient for at \nleast four reasons. \n69.  First, the government changed its longstanding position on the de minimis exemp-\ntion without considering “serious reliance interests.”  Regents, 591 U.S. at 30 (quotation marks \nomitted); see FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  Businesses like \nDetroit Axle have made large investments in international supply chains to provide their U.S. cus-\ntomers with the best goods at the lowest prices.  Detroit Axle’s Mexico facility is a case in point:  \nThe company leased the facility using long-term contracts, signed contracts with suppliers in \nChina, hired and trained employees to work in its facilities, made capital investments in its physical \nplant and equipment, and partnered with shippers to move its products into the United States—all \nin reliance on the availability of the de minimis exemption that would enable it to sell goods from \nthat facility in a cost-effective way.  In addition, U.S. consumers—like individual car owners and \nlocal repair shops that use Detroit Axle’s parts—have relied on the continued availability of low-\ncost goods from companies like Detroit Axle.  The sudden abrogation of the de minimis exemption \nupset all of these significant reliance interests.  Yet neither the President nor any implementing \nagency has said anything about this “important aspect of the problem.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.   \n70.  Second, the government failed to consider other important aspects of the problem.  \nFor example, it did not consider all the economic costs and benefits of eliminating the exemption, \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 21 of 34\nwhich Congress has repeatedly concluded benefits U.S. businesses and consumers.  It did not ad-\ndress the effect that abrogating the de minimis exemption might have for U.S. exporters, who rely \non other countries’ de minimis exemptions, and the Americans employed by such companies.  See \nCRS Report, Imports & Section 321, supra, at 22–23.  It did not grapple with the substantially \nincreased burden on customs officials who will have to collect small-dollar tariffs on millions of \nadditional imports.  Nor did it consider that it was putting American businesses like Detroit Axle \nat a competitive disadvantage relative to Chinese counterparts that import through the postal ser-\nvice and are subject to lower effective tariff rates.  See Exec. Order Modifying Reciprocal Tariff \nRates to Reflect Discussions with the People’s Republic of China, § 4 (May 12, 2025). \n71.  Third, the government failed to consider reasonable alternatives to eliminating the \nde minimis exemption.  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 48, 50–52.  Again, the government’s sole expla-\nnation was that “shippers often avoid detection [of narcotics] due to administration of the de min-\nimis exemption.”  Exec. Order No. 14256, § 1.  But if smuggling opioids were the problem, the \nobvious solution would be simply to inspect packages entering the United States regardless of \ndeclared value.  The government can inspect packages without levying tariffs on them—or at the \nvery least, it could inspect packages while charging no more than a nominal fee the recoup the \ngovernment’s costs of inspection.  At a minimum, the government had to consider that alternative \n(among others) and explain why it was infeasible.  See Yakima Valley Cablevision, Inc. v. FCC, \n794 F.2d 737, 746 n.36 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“The failure of an agency to consider obvious alternatives \nhas led uniformly to reversal.”). \n72.  Fourth, the government’s explanation is arbitrary because there is no rational con-\nnection between means and ends.  The imposition of tariffs on items worth less than $800 has no \narticulated or apparent link to the problem the government cited as justification.  Moreover, the \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 22 of 34\navailability of an “obvious alternative[]”—inspecting packages for narcotics—suggests that the \ngovernment’s explanation is pretextual.  Yakima Valley, 794 F.2d at 746 n.36; see Dep’t of Com. \nv. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019) (the “reasoned explanation requirement of administrative \nlaw” requires “genuine justifications,” not “contrived reasons”).   \nII.  The IEEPA Tariffs Applicable To Detroit Axle Are Unlawful.  \n73.  Even if the de minimis exemption were restored, Detroit Axle’s imports to its \nMichigan facility still would remain subject to the 20% tariffs the President has recently imposed \nunder IEEPA.  Exec. Order No. 14195, § 2(a); Exec. Order No. 14228, § 2.  Those IEEPA tariffs \nare unlawful.  IEEPA gives the President certain authorities to respond to national emergencies, \nbut it does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.  That is both the best interpretation of the \nstatutory text, and the only interpretation that is consistent with the Constitution.  The IEEPA \ntariffs also are arbitrary and capricious because, in implementing the tariffs, the government failed \nto consider important aspects of the problem, including reliance interests and obvious alternatives, \nand did not reasonably explain its actions.  \nA.  IEEPA Does Not Authorize The Executive Branch To Impose Tariffs. \n74.  IEEPA’s text and context make clear that it does not grant the Executive Branch \nany authority to impose tariffs.   \n75.  The Taxing Clause of the Constitution vests exclusively in Congress the “Power \nTo lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  As the \nclause’s name suggests, tariffs (another word for “duties” or “imposts”) are a form of taxation.  \nIndeed, tariffs were a major revenue source for the federal government until the ratification of the \nSixteenth Amendment in 1913.  See Daniel K. Tarullo, Law and Politics in Twentieth Century \nTariff History, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 285, 285 (1986); Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276, \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 23 of 34\n285 (1976) (explaining that the Framers intended for “import revenues . . . to be the major source \nof revenue of the Federal Government”). \n76.  Unsurprisingly, then, Congress has jealously guarded its tariff authority through the \ncenturies.  For nearly 150 years, Congress set tariff rates directly.  See Tarullo, supra, at 285–86.  \nSince then, Congress has delegated to the President authority to impose or adjust tariffs only in \nnarrow circumstances.  Congress generally has delegated this authority expressly and imposed \nstringent procedural or substantive safeguards to ensure that the power is not abused.  For example, \nSection 122  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974,  19 U.S.C.  § 2132,  permits  the  President  in  narrow \ncircumstances to impose a tariff “for a period not exceeding 150 days” at an amount “not to exceed \n15 percent ad valorem.”  Id. § 21132(a)(A).   \n77.  IEEPA is a different animal altogether.  IEEPA authorizes the President to exercise \ncertain authorities “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole \nor substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy \nof the United States.”  50 U.S.C. § 1701(a).  As relevant here, those authorities include the \npower to:    \n(B) investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, \ndirect and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, \nholding,  withholding,  use,  transfer,  withdrawal,  transportation, \nimportation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, \nor privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in \nwhich any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest by any \nperson, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States \n50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B). \n78.  Nowhere in Section 1702’s extensive list of enumerated powers is any mention of \nthe power to impose tariffs.  Nor does the list contain any of the most common alternative ways \none might describe the imposition of tariffs:  There is no mention of “taxes,” “duties,” “imposts,” \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 24 of 34\nor “excises,” or the ability to “lay,” or “collect” them.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  The most \nnatural conclusion to draw from that absence is that IEEPA does not authorize the imposition of \ntariffs.  \n79.  The closest IEEPA comes to tariffs is the power to “regulate . . . importation or \nexportation of . . . property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.”  \n50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B).  But “regulating the importation of property” would be an exceedingly \noblique way to describe the imposition of tariffs.  To “regulate” means “to govern or direct \naccording to rule.”  Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, 1913 (1961).  So the most \nnatural reading of “regulate” in IEEPA is that it allows the President to create rules that restrict or \nlimit the importation of property or set special conditions for such importation (e.g., quotas).   \n80.  By contrast, imposing a tariff—requiring the payment of money equal to some \npercentage  of  an  imported  good’s  value—no  more  “regulates”  imports  than  income  taxes \n“regulate” incomes.  That is simply not how ordinary English speakers use the word “regulate.”  \nAnd it is not how generations of lawmakers and lawyers have used it either.  See, e.g., U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 8, cl. 1 (providing separate powers to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises” \nand to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations”); Diginet, Inc. v. W. Union ATS, Inc., 958 F.2d \n1388, 1399 (7th Cir. 1992) (“The legal power to regulate is not necessarily the legal power to \ntax.”).  \n81.  Conversely, Congress knows how to enact statutes authorizing tariffs and often \ndoes so expressly, using language that leaves no doubt as to the power granted.  See, e.g., 19 U.S.C. \n§ 2132(a)(A) (the President “shall proclaim . . . a temporary import surcharge, not to exceed \n15 percent ad valorem, in the form of duties . . . on articles imported into the United States”); id. \n§ 2253(a)(3)(A) (President may “proclaim an increase in, or the imposition of, any duty on the \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 25 of 34\nimported article”); id. § 2411(c)(1)(B) (U.S. Trade Representative may “impose duties or other \nimport restrictions”).  That other statutes expressly grant the Executive Branch the authority to \nimpose tariffs in limited circumstances makes it implausible that IEEPA’s general language about \nregulating imports granted an unlimited power to impose tariffs in purported emergencies.   \n82.  The implausibility of IEEPA granting tariff authority obliquely is buttressed by the \nenormity and novelty of the power the President now claims.  Since IEEPA was enacted 50 years \nago, no President has ever purported to impose tariffs—let alone massive, global tariffs—under \nthat Act.  When the Executive Branch “claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded \npower to regulate a significant portion of the American economy,” the Supreme Court has \ninstructed courts to greet that “announcement with a measure of skepticism.”  Util. Air, 573 U.S. \nat 324 (quotation marks omitted); see also Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 119 \n(2022).  In those circumstances, courts will not “assume that Congress entrusted that task to [the \nExecutive] without a clear statement to that effect.”  Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 506 (2023) \n(quotation marks omitted).  “[M]odest words, vague terms, or subtle devices” will not suffice.  \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). \n83.  The President’s attempt to use IEEPA to impose his tariffs is the paradigm major-\nquestions case.  The authority to “regulate” imports, 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B), is a classic “vague \nterm[].”  West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 723 (quotation marks omitted).  And it is hard to imagine a \npower with greater consequences for the U.S. economy and system of government than the \nPresident’s purported authority to unilaterally impose tariffs at any level on any country.  In fact, \nthe power to control the raising of revenue through tariffs and taxes has long been viewed by \nEnglish and American authorities as the Legislature’s most powerful check on the Executive, \nenabling  it  to  “reduc[e]  . . .  all  the  overgrown  prerogatives  of  the  other  branches  of  the \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 26 of 34\ngovernment.”  The Federalist No. 58 (James Madison).  Given the historic importance of the \nlegislative power to raise revenue, it is even more unlikely that Congress gave the Executive a \nblank check to exercise that power using equivocal language.  So the “most natural interpretation” \nof IEEPA is that it does not grant the tariff authority that the President has purported to exercise.  \nBiden, 600 U.S. at 508 (Barrett, J., concurring).  \n84.  Thus, IEEPA’s text, statutory context, and the major-questions doctrine all make \nclear that IEEPA does not grant any authority to impose tariffs. \nB.  If IEEPA Purported To Authorize Tariffs, It Would Be An Unconstitutional \nDelegation Of Congressional Power.  \n85.  Even if a court’s “initial skepticism” of the government’s expansive interpretation \nof IEEPA were “overcome by text directly authorizing” the imposition of tariffs, the attempted \n“statutory delegation [would] exceed[] constitutional limits.”  Biden, 600 U.S. at 516–17 & n.4 \n(Barrett, J., concurring).  That is because IEEPA lacks any “intelligible principle” to constrain the \nExecutive’s exercise of the legislative power to impose tariffs.  J.W. Hampton Jr., & Co. v. United \nStates, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). \n86.  As noted above, the Constitution expressly grants Congress, not the President, the \n“Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  \n“Accompanying that assignment of power” comes a concomitant “bar on its further delegation.”  \nGundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 135 (2019).  Thus, before Congress may delegate its tariff \npower to the Executive Branch, it must “lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to \nwhich the person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform.”  \nMistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 27 of 34\n87.  The “nondelegation inquiry”—“whether Congress has supplied an intelligible prin-\nciple to guide the delegee’s use of discretion”—“always begins (and often almost ends) with stat-\nutory interpretation.”  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135.  That is true here.  As discussed above, IEEPA does \nnot discuss tariffs, see supra ¶¶ 78–82, so, a fortiori, it does not supply any principle to guide the \nPresident’s use of any tariff authority.  Even if the power to impose tariffs were somehow encom-\npassed within the power to “regulate” imports,  50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B), there would still be no \nintelligible principle here.  While that statutory power is authorized only to respond to an “unusual \nand extraordinary threat,” id. § 1701(a), IEEPA says nothing about when tariffs (as opposed to \nsome other measure) are an appropriate response to such a threat, what tariff level (from 1% to \n10,000%) might be appropriate, or how broadly the tariffs might sweep in terms of countries and \nproducts.  If the President were authorized to impose any tariffs he wanted with no better compass \nthan the phrase “unusual and extraordinary threat,” then he would have at least as much unbridled \nauthority as the Federal Trade Commission did when Congress unconstitutionally instructed it to \n“regulate the entire economy on the basis of no more precise a standard than stimulating the econ-\nomy by assuring ‘fair competition.’”  Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 474 \n(2001) (citing A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935)).  \n88.  Moreover, a court “choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a stat-\nutory text” should “presum[e] that Congress did not intend the alternative which raises serious \nconstitutional doubts.”  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005).  Here, there is an alternative \ninterpretation of IEEPA that does not raise constitutional nondelegation problems:  IEEPA does \nnot authorize the Executive Branch to impose tariffs.  That interpretation is at least “plausible,” so \nthis Court should choose it based on the “reasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 28 of 34\nalternative”—a massive, standardless grant of Congress’s tariff power—“which raises serious con-\nstitutional doubts.”  Clark, 543 U.S. at 381. \nC.  Agency  Action  Implementing  The  IEEPA  Tariffs  Is  Arbitrary  And \nCapricious. \n89.  The government’s implementation of the IEEPA tariffs is arbitrary and capricious \nbecause it effectuates a policy that is neither “reasonable [nor] reasonably explained.”  Ohio, \n603 U.S. at 292 (quotation marks omitted). \n90.  The executive orders and the agency notices implementing the tariffs suffer from \nlargely the same flaws as the orders and agency actions eliminating the de minimis exemption.  \nThe government has claimed that the tariffs are necessary to combat the flow of synthetic opioids \nfrom China.  See Exec. Order No. 14195, § 1(a); 90 Fed. Reg. 9,038, 9,038 (Feb. 5, 2025).  But it \nhas not explained why tariffs, as opposed to any other mechanism, are necessary for this purpose; \nit has not even explained how tariffs would serve that goal.  See generally Exec. Order No. 14195.  \nNor has the government considered reasonable alternatives (such as inspections), or the “serious \nreliance interests” that decades of low tariffs have inured in the public.  Regents, 591 U.S. at 30 \n(quotation marks omitted). \nCOUNT I \nLack of Statutory and Constitutional Authority—De Minimis Exemption \n(APA and Equitable Causes of Action—All Defendants) \n \n91.  Plaintiff incorporates all the above allegations by reference. \n92.  Congress required a de minimis exemption for goods totaling less than $800 per \nperson per day.  19 U.S.C. § 1321(a)(2)(C).  Congress thereby precluded any Executive Branch \nauthority to: (1) reduce the de minimis exemption below the $800 floor, or (2) modify the exemp-\ntion in any way except through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  Id. § 1321(b). \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 29 of 34\n93.  The executive orders purporting to rescind the de minimis exemption are therefore \nineffective and unlawful because they defy Congress’s commands with respect to Congress’s \npower over tariffs.  They also unconstitutionally seek to exercise a power over tariffs that Congress \nhas not granted, arrogating to the Executive Branch a power belonging to Congress.  \n94.  The rescission of the de minimis exemption is causing Detroit Axle irreparable \nharm through unrecoverable damages, including lost business opportunities and the loss of cus-\ntomer goodwill, and will soon force the company to close its Michigan facilities and lay off its \nemployees.  \n95.  This Court possesses “all the powers in law and equity of, or as conferred by statute \nupon, a district court of the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1585.  That includes the power to declare \nan executive order and agency actions implementing it unlawful.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2201.  This \nCourt also has power under the APA to hold unlawful and set aside the final agency actions im-\nplementing unlawful executive orders based on their lack of statutory authority or violation of the \nConstitution.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).   \n96.  Detroit Axle also has an equitable cause of action to enjoin “violations of federal \nlaw by federal officials,” including to enjoin “unconstitutional actions.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015); see Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. \n94, 110 (1902).  Judicial “[r]eview for ultra vires acts rests on the longstanding principle that if an \nagency action is unauthorized by the statute under which [the agency] assumes to act, the agency \nhas violate[d] the law and the courts generally have jurisdiction to grant relief.”  Nat’l Ass’n of \nPostal Supervisors v. U.S. Postal Serv., 26 F.4th 960, 970 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (alterations in original; \nquotation marks omitted).  When a “statutory provision plainly delineates the outer limits of \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 30 of 34\nagency authority and Congress has not expressly precluded judicial review,” plaintiffs have a cause \nof action to enjoin ultra vires acts.  Id. at 971.      \n97.  This Court should declare the executive orders purporting to rescind the de minimis \nexemption unlawful, enjoin Defendants from implementing those orders, and hold unlawful and \nset aside all final agency action implementing those orders.    \nCOUNT II \nArbitrary and Capricious Rescission of De Minimis Exemption \n(APA Cause of Action—Agency Defendants) \n98.  Plaintiff incorporates all the above allegations by reference. \n99.  The final agency actions implementing the unlawful rescission of the de minimis \nexemption are arbitrary and capricious because they are neither reasonable nor reasonably ex-\nplained.   \n100.  Defendants DHS, CBP, Noem, and Flores issued notices in the Federal Register \nthat effectuate the elimination of the de minimis exemption, including the final notice that “duty-\nfree de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. § 1321(a)(2)(C) shall no longer be available for prod-\nucts of the PRC described in Section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195, that are entered for consump-\ntion, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time \non May 2, 2025.”  90 Fed. Reg. 17,608, 17,609 (Apr. 28, 2025); see also Customs & Border Prot., \nExecutive Order – Tariff on De Minimis Shipments from China, Article No. 000001915 (May 8, \n2025), https://tinyurl.com/6kj36jys.  These notices constituted final agency action because they \n“mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and give rise to “legal conse-\nquences.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (quotation marks omitted).  Upon infor-\nmation and belief, CBP has not been applying the de minimis exemption since May 2, 2025, at \n12:01 am.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 31 of 34\n101.  With respect to Defendant Lutnick and the Department of Commerce, Defendant \nLutnick notified the President that adequate systems were in place to rescind the de minimis ex-\nemption, pursuant to an executive order charging him with that duty.  See Exec. Order No. 14200, \n§ 1; Exec. Order No. 14256, § 2.  \n102.  With respect to Secretary Bessent and the Department of the Treasury, the Secre-\ntary of the Treasury alone has statutory authority to promulgate rules to create exceptions to the \nde minimis exemption, and even he cannot modify the $800 floor.  See 19 U.S.C. § 1321(b).   \n103.  Because the rescission of the de minimis exemption was arbitrary and capricious, \nfinal agency action implementing that policy is arbitrary and capricious as well.  See Reich, 74 F.3d \nat 1326–27.  The government has failed to consider important aspects of the problem, such as \nreliance interests like Detroit Axle’s.  It did not offer reasonable explanations for its decisions and \nignored obvious alternatives.  Moreover, the agency actions to rescind the de minimis exemption \nare arbitrary and capricious because no agency “reasonably explained” (i) the lawful basis for \nstopping the application of the de minimis exemption to products of China or (ii) the adequate \nsystems in place to rescind the exemption.  Ohio, 603 U.S. at 292 (quotation marks omitted). \n104.  The agency actions nullifying the de minimis exemption are causing Detroit Axle \nirreparable harm through unrecoverable damages, including lost business opportunities and the \nloss of customer goodwill, and will soon force the company to close its Michigan facilities and lay \noff its employees. \n105.  This Court should “hold unlawful and set aside” the arbitrary and capricious agency \nactions rescinding the de minimis exemption.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see 90 Fed. Reg. 17,608, \n17,608–10 (Apr. 28, 2025); Customs & Border Prot., Executive Order – Tariff on De Minimis \nShipments from China, Article No. 000001915 (May 8, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/6kj36jys. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 32 of 34\nCOUNT III \nLack of Statutory and Constitutional Authority—IEEPA Tariffs \n(APA and Equitable Causes of Action—All Defendants) \n106.  Plaintiff incorporates all the above allegations by reference. \n107.  IEEPA grants the President certain authorities to “deal with” “unusual and extraor-\ndinary threat[s].”  50 U.S.C. § 1701(a).  But the text, statutory context, and the major-questions \ndoctrine make clear that IEEPA does not grant the President authority to impose tariffs.   \n108.  Thus, the President’s imposition of the IEEPA tariffs and all actions taken by the \nDefendants to implement the tariffs exceed the Executive Branch’s statutory authority under \nIEEPA.  And if IEEPA in fact purported to authorize the imposition of tariffs, it would be an \nunconstitutional delegation, and tariffs imposed pursuant to IEEPA would be unconstitutional.   \n109.  The tariffs are causing Detroit Axle irreparable harm through unrecoverable dam-\nages, including lost business opportunities and the loss of customer goodwill, and will soon force \nthe company to close its Michigan facilities and lay off its employees. \n110.  The Court should declare the tariffs unlawful, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, enjoin their en-\nforcement as ultra vires, Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327, and “set aside” all final agency actions im-\nplementing them, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); see 90 Fed. Reg. 11,426, 11,426–29 (Mar. 6, 2025) (imple-\nmenting 20% tariff). \nCOUNT IV \nArbitrary and Capricious Imposition of IEEPA Tariffs \n(APA Cause of Action—Agency Defendants) \n111.  Plaintiff incorporates all the above allegations by reference. \n112.  The agency Defendants have arbitrarily and capriciously imposed the tariffs that \nthe President ordered pursuant to IEEPA.  The tariff policy that the agencies are implementing is \nneither “reasonable [nor] reasonably explained,” Ohio, 603 U.S. at 292 (quotation marks omitted), \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 33 of 34\nbecause the government failed to consider obvious alternatives, did not explain why its chosen \ncourse of action serves its goal of combatting fentanyl trafficking, and ignored an important aspect \nof the problem—the significant reliance interests of U.S. businesses like Detroit Axle and their \ncustomers.  \n113.  The agency actions implementing the IEEPA tariffs are causing Detroit Axle irrep-\narable harm through unrecoverable damages, including lost business opportunities and the loss of \ncustomer goodwill, and will soon force the company to close its Michigan facilities and lay off its \nemployees.    \n114.  This Court should “hold unlawful and set aside” the arbitrary and capricious agency \nactions imposing the IEEPA tariffs.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see 90 Fed. Reg. 11,426, 11,426–29 \n(Mar. 6, 2025) (implementing 20% tariff); 90 Fed. Reg. 9,038, 9,038–40 (Feb. 5, 2025) (imple-\nmenting original 10% tariff). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests an order: \n \na.  Declaring that Executive Orders 14194 (Mexico de minimis rescission), 14195 \n(China initial de minimis rescission; China fentanyl initial tariff), and 14200 (China \nde minimis pause), 14228 (China fentanyl tariff increase), 14256 (China de minimis \nrescission), and all actions taken to implement those orders, are unlawful because \nthey exceed the Executive Branch’s statutory and constitutional authority;  \nb.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants and all persons acting in con-\ncert with them from taking any action to implement Executive Orders 14194, \n14195, 14200, 14228, and 14256;  \nc.  Holding unlawful and setting aside all final agency actions implementing Executive \nOrders 14194, 14195, 14200, 14228, and 14256;  \nd.  Declaring that any and all actions taken to implement those orders are unlawful \nbecause they exceed the Executive Branch’s statutory and constitutional authority; \ne.  Directing Defendants to refund, with interest, any duties paid by Plaintiff pursuant \nto the actions identified above and any future actions imposing tariffs in reliance \non IEEPA, and to pay other such damages as are appropriate; \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00091-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/16/25      Page 34 of 34\nf.
