INTRODUCTION \n14 \nPlaintiff Fadi El Bitar is currently detained by U.S. Immigration and \n15 \nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) at the Northwest ICE Processing Center and is \n16 \nscheduled for removal tomorrow on May 20, 2025. He has filed a complaint seeking \n17 \na writ of mandamus and relief under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and \n18 \na motion for a temporary restraining order seeking an immediate stay of removal. \n19 \nDkt. Nos. 1, 3. El Bitar has not provided notice to the Government.  \n20 \nThe Court recognizes that ex parte TROs are an extraordinary measure, but \n21 \nEl Bitar has raised serious questions about whether the Government has carried \n22 \nout its statutory duty to provide him—as an asylum seeker—a credible fear \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 1 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 2 of 11\n \ninterview. And he has shown that deportation to a country where he will face \n1 \nphysical danger presents irreparable harm. After carefully examining the record \n2 \nand the applicable law, the Court finds that this case presents one of those rare \n3 \ncircumstances where immediate intervention is necessary to preserve the status \n4 \nquo until both parties can present their arguments. This approach balances the \n5 \nextraordinary nature of ex parte relief against the concrete risk of irreversible \n6 \nharm.  \n7 \n8 \n2.  BACKGROUND \n9 \nEl Bitar is a citizen of Lebanon. Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 1. On January 21, 2025, El Bitar \n10 \nsurrendered himself to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the U.S. \n11 \nborder. Id. ¶ 2–3. CBP detained El Bitar and transferred him to ICE custody. Id. \n12 \n¶ 3. El Bitar expressed a fear of persecution in Lebanon and requested a credible \n13 \nfear interview. Id. ¶ 6. El Bitar’s counsel reached out multiple times to both CBP \n14 \nand ICE to secure a credible fear interview. Id. ¶¶ 6, 9, 13, 27. \n15 \nOn April 16, 2025, ICE took El Bitar from his cell to an interview room where \n16 \nhe was asked questions about his fear of returning to Lebanon. Id. ¶ 29. ICE denied \n17 \nEl Bitar access to his counsel even though he requested it. Id. ¶ 30. On April 18, \n18 \n2025, ICE informed El Bitar that the interview results were negative and that ICE \n19 \nwould be deporting him in 30 days. Id. ¶ 32. On April 21, 2025, El Bitar’s counsel \n20 \nemailed Seattle ICE, the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, and the Asylum Pre-\n21 \nScreening Officer (APSO), requesting an immigration judge review the negative \n22 \ncredible fear finding. Id. ¶¶ 35–37. The APSO replied stating that El Bitar was not \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 3 of 11\n \nreferred to U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) for a credible fear \n1 \ninterview and that there are no documents to serve upon counsel’s office or review \n2 \nby the immigration judge. Id. ¶ 38. Again, on May 6, 2025, El Bitar’s counsel \n3 \nemailed ICE Seattle explaining the situation and ICE Seattle again referred counsel \n4 \nto USCIS. Id. ¶ 42. Despite the April 16, 2025, questioning, ICE and USCIS deny \n5 \never interviewing El Bitar to assess the credibility of his fear of returning to \n6 \nLebanon. Id. ¶ 62. \n7 \nEl Bitar alleges that the Government has denied him his statutory right to \n8 \nhave his fear of returning to his country considered by a USCIS asylum officer \n9 \nduring a credible fear interview under 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d) and 8 U.S.C. § \n10 \n1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). Id. ¶ 56. El Bitar also alleges that USCIS has denied him a written \n11 \nnotice of its credible fear decision and review by an immigration judge, citing 8 \n12 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d), (e)(1), (f), (g)(1) and 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III). Id. ¶ 57. \n13 \nFinally, El Bitar alleges that ICE is violating its statutory duty under 8 C.F.R. § \n14 \n208.30(b) and 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) to defer removal until the credible fear \n15 \nprocess is complete. Id. ¶ 66. El Bitar asks that the Court stay his removal \n16 \nscheduled for tomorrow until the Government provides him a proper credible fear \n17 \ninterview per the statutory procedures. Dkt. No. 3 at 5. \n18 \n19 \n3.  DISCUSSION \n20 \n3.1  Legal standard.  \n21 \nThe standard for issuing a TRO is the same as the standard for issuing a \n22 \npreliminary injunction. See New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 4 of 11\n \nU.S. 1345, 1347 n.2 (1977). A TRO is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be \n1 \nawarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. \n2 \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). “The proper legal standard for \n3 \npreliminary injunctive relief requires a party to demonstrate (1) ‘that he is likely to \n4 \nsucceed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \n5 \nof preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and (4) that an \n6 \ninjunction is in the public interest.’” Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1127 \n7 \n(9th Cir. 2009) (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 20). These four factors—the Winter \n8 \nfactors—apply whenever a preliminary injunction is sought. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20; \n9 \nsee All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011) (“a \n10 \nshowing on all four prongs” is required). \n11 \nThe Ninth Circuit takes a “sliding scale” approach to preliminary relief, \n12 \nunder which “serious questions going to the merits and a balance of hardships that \n13 \ntips sharply towards the plaintiffs can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, \n14 \nso long as the plaintiffs also show that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and \n15 \nthat the injunction is in the public interest.” Fraihat v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs \n16 \nEnf’t, 16 F.4th 613, 635 (9th Cir. 2021) (cleaned up). This approach allows a \n17 \nstronger showing of one Winter factor to offset a weaker showing of another. \n18 \nPlanned Parenthood Great Nw., Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky v. Labrador, \n19 \n122 F.4th 825, 843–44 (9th Cir. 2024). \n20 \nAfter considering the record and the applicable legal standard, the Court \n21 \nconcludes that an emergency TRO is warranted for the reasons stated below. \n22 \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 4 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 5 of 11\n \n3.2  El Bitar raises serious questions going to the merits.  \n1 \nEl Bitar raises serious questions going to the merits of his APA claim, \n2 \nparticularly regarding the Government’s apparent failure to follow mandatory \n3 \nstatutory procedures for asylum seekers.1  \n4 \nFirst, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) provides that if an alien indicates an \n5 \nintention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution, “the officer shall refer the \n6 \nalien for an interview by an asylum officer.” (emphasis added). The use of “shall” \n7 \ncreates a mandatory duty. See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & \n8 \nLerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998) (noting that “shall” means “mandatory” and \n9 \n“normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion”). \n10 \nSecond, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d) specifically requires that asylum officers conduct \n11 \ncredible fear interviews in a non-adversarial manner, with the goal of “elicit[ing] all \n12 \nrelevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a credible \n13 \nfear of persecution or torture.” See also Innovation L. Lab v. Wolf, 951 F.3d 1073, \n14 \n1089 (9th Cir. 2020), vacated and remanded sub nom. Mayorkas v. Innovation L. \n15 \nLab, 141 S. Ct. 2842, 210 L. Ed. 2d 955 (2021), and vacated as moot sub nom. \n16 \nInnovation L. Lab v. Mayorkas, 5 F.4th 1099 (9th Cir. 2021). The regulation further \n17 \nmandates specific procedural protections, including requiring the asylum officer to \n18 \n19 \n20 \n \n21  1 The Court addresses only the merits of El Bitar’s APA claim in this Order. See \nVersaterm Inc. v. City of Seattle, C16-1217-JLR, 2016 WL 4793239, at *5 (W.D. \n22  Wash. Sept. 13, 2016) (“Where a party asserts multiple claims, the court need not \nfind that the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of all of the plaintiff’s claims \n23  to issue a preliminary injunction.”). \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 5 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 6 of 11\n \n“verify that the alien has received information about the credible fear process.” 8 \n1 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)(2). \n2 \nThird, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g)(1) provides that if an asylum officer determines \n3 \nthat an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution, the officer “shall provide \n4 \nthe alien with a written notice of decision” and inquire whether the alien wishes to \n5 \nhave an immigration judge review the negative determination. \n6 \n The record raises substantial questions about whether these mandatory \n7 \nprocedures were followed. The APSO has explicitly stated that El Bitar “was not \n8 \nreferred to USCIS for a credible fear interview,” Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 38, yet ICE appears to \n9 \nhave conducted some form of interview and made a negative determination without \n10 \nproviding written documentation or offering El Bitar the opportunity for review by \n11 \nan immigration judge, as required by the regulations. \n12 \nSection 706(1) of the APA requires the reviewing court to “compel agency \n13 \naction unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” CRVQ v. USCIS, No.: CV 19- \n14 \n8566, 2020 WL 8994098 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 24, 2020) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(1)) (citing \n15 \n5 U.S.C. § 555(b) (“With due regard for the convenience and necessity of the parties \n16 \n. . . and within a reasonable time, each agency shall proceed to conclude a matter \n17 \npresented to it.”)). To decide whether an agency’s delay is unreasonable, district \n18 \ncourts in the Ninth Circuit use the six-factor “TRAC test.” The factors are:  \n19 \n1.  the time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a rule of \n20 \nreason;  \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 6 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 7 of 11\n \n2.  where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed \n1 \nwith which it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute, that \n2 \nstatutory scheme may supply content for this rule of reason;  \n3 \n3.  delays that might be reasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less \n4 \ntolerable when human health and welfare are at stake;  \n5 \n4.  the court should consider the effect of expediting delayed action on agency \n6 \nactivities of a higher or competing priority;  \n7 \n5.  the court should also take into account the nature and extent of the interests \n8 \nprejudiced by delay; and  \n9 \n6.  the court need not find any impropriety lurking behind agency lassitude in \n10 \norder to hold that agency action is unreasonably delayed. \n11 \nIn re Pesticide Action Network N. Am., Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 798 F.3d \n12 \n809, 813 (9th Cir. 2015) (citing Telecommunications Rsch. & Action Ctr. v. F.C.C., \n13 \n750 F.2d 70, 79 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“TRAC”)). \n14 \nConsidering these factors here, El Bitar raises serious questions about the \n15 \nreasonableness of the Government’s withholding of a proper credible fear interview. \n16 \nThe third and fifth factors are particularly informative, as El Bitar faces extreme \n17 \nprejudice through deportation, and his health and welfare are at stake.  \n18 \nGiven the balance of hardships tips sharply in El Bitar’s favor, as explained \n19 \nbelow, this showing is sufficient under the Ninth Circuit’s sliding scale approach to \n20 \nwarrant temporary relief while the Court more fully considers the merits.  \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 7 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 8 of 11\n \n3.3  The remaining Winter factors support a TRO.  \n1 \nThe second Winter factor—irreparable harm—tips sharply in favor of a TRO. \n2 \nEl  Bitar has expressed fear of returning to his home country of Lebanon because of \n3 \nhis political opinion against the designated terrorist group, Hezbollah. El Bitar has \n4 \nrefused to support or join Hezbollah and, in response, received death threats forcing \n5 \nhim to flee the country. Also, El Bitar’s wife and children are present in the United \n6 \nStates and separation from them would cause irreparable harm. These potential \n7 \nharms are severe, concrete, and cannot be remedied through monetary \n8 \ncompensation. See Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2011) (“[A] \n9 \nnoncitizen must show that there is a reason specific to his or her case, as opposed to \n10 \na reason that would apply equally well to all aliens and all cases, that removal \n11 \nwould inflict irreparable harm[.]”). \n12 \nThe final two Winter factors, which involve balancing the equities and \n13 \nconsidering the public interest, merge when the Government is a party to a case. \n14 \nPadilla v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 953 F.3d 1134, 1141 (9th Cir. 2020). These \n15 \nfactors also tip sharply in El Bitar’s favor. While the public has an interest in the \n16 \nenforcement of immigration laws, that interest is not served by enforcement that \n17 \nskirts statutory and regulatory requirements. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, “the \n18 \npublic also has an interest in ensuring that ‘statutes enacted by their \n19 \nrepresentatives’ are not imperiled by executive fiat.” E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. \n20 \nTrump, 932 F.3d 742, 779 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, \n21 \n1301 (2012)). \n22 \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 8 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 9 of 11\n \nThus, a TRO precluding El Bitar’s deportation would change little to nothing \n1 \nfor the agencies involved. Meanwhile, absent a TRO, El Bitar will face life-changing \n2 \nand irreparable harm.  \n3 \n4 \n3.4  An ex parte TRO is appropriate and necessary.  \n5 \nCourts will rarely grant TROs ex parte. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b); LCR 65(b). But \n6 \n“if the movant meets the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b), the court may grant \n7 \nthe motion without awaiting a response.” LCR 65(b).  \n8 \nAlthough El Bitar has not submitted a sworn declaration under penalty of \n9 \nperjury specifically addressing his fear of death, the verified complaint contains \n10 \ndetailed allegations that satisfy Rule 65(b)’s requirements. The Court also notes \n11 \nthat El Bitar's counsel has documented extensive attempts to engage with the \n12 \nproper government agencies regarding El Bitar's credible fear interview, effectively \n13 \nputting those agencies on notice of El Bitar’s claims. See Dkt. No. 1 ¶¶ 6–7, 9, 12–\n14 \n15, 17–18, 23, 27, 35, 37, 39, 40, 42 (documenting communications with ICE, \n15 \nUSCIS, and asylum offices). \n16 \nGiven the imminent threat of deportation—El Bitar’s removal is scheduled \n17 \nfor tomorrow—combined with the serious questions raised and risk of irreparable \n18 \nharm, the Court finds ex parte relief warranted. The Court emphasizes that this \n19 \norder is merely temporary, preserving the status quo until both parties can be \n20 \nheard at a preliminary injunction hearing, which will be scheduled promptly. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 9 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 10 of 11\n \n4.  CONCLUSION \n1 \nAccordingly, the Court ORDERS that Defendants and all their officers, \n2 \nagents, servants, employees, attorneys, and persons acting on their behalf in concert \n3 \nor in participation with them are immediately enjoined from:  \n4 \n(a) Removing or deporting El Bitar from the United States; and  \n5 \n(b) Transferring El Bitar from the Northwest ICE Processing Center to any \n6 \nother facility during the pendency of these proceedings.  \n7 \nUnless extended by the Court, this Temporary Restraining Order expires 14 \n8 \ndays from entry. No security bond is required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n9 \n65(c) because Defendants face no realistic likelihood of harm from enjoining their \n10 \nconduct. Jorgensen v. Cassiday, 320 F.3d 906, 919 (9th Cir. 2003). \n11 \nEl Bitar must immediately serve Defendants with a copy of his complaint, his \n12 \nmotion for a temporary restraining order, and this Order. El Bitar must file proof of \n13 \nsuch service with the Court within 24 hours of this Order. \n14 \nTo the extent El Bitar intends to move for a preliminary injunction, the \n15 \nparties are ordered to meet and confer and file a joint status report by May 27, \n16 \n2025, (1) proposing a preliminary injunction briefing schedule, (2) indicating \n17 \nwhether they believe a hearing is necessary, and if so, (3) indicating whether they \n18 \nplan to present evidence at the hearing. \n19 \n \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER - 10 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-05431-JNW     Document 8     Filed 05/19/25     Page 11 of 11\n \nDated this 19th day of May, 2025. \n1 \n \n2 \nA   \n3 \nJamal N.
