United States, was filed a few days later and made similar arguments.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 2025, GK Industries America, a Canadian auto parts company, and one of its affiliates filed this case in the U.S. Court of International Trade. They sued the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The companies argued that two rounds of tariffs on Chinese imports went beyond what the President was allowed to do under the Trade Act of 1974. They said the tariffs were not about fixing unfair trade practices, as the law allows, but were used to pressure China on unrelated economic issues.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to rule that the tariffs were unlawful, stop the government from enforcing them, and refund the extra import taxes they had paid during the two years before filing the lawsuit.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 2025, the case was automatically paused under an administrative order that automatically pauses this type of tariff lawsuit once they are filed.\r\n\r\nAs of October 8, 2025, the case is still on hold.",

AND GK  : \nINDUSTRIES LTD.,  : \n  : \n  Plaintiffs,  : \n  : \n    v.  : \n  :   Court No. 25-87 \nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  : \nTHE UNITED STATES TRADE  : \nREPRESENTATIVE, U.S. CUSTOMS & BORDER  : \nPROTECTION,   : \n  : \n    Defendants.  : \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------  X \n \nCOMPLAINT \nPlaintiffs, GK INDUSTRIES AMERICA, INC. AND GK INDUSTRIES LTD., by and \nthrough undersigned counsel, for its Complaint in this matter against Defendants, THE UNITED \nSTATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE, and U.S. \nCUSTOMS & BORDER PROTECTION, does hereby state, plead, and allege as follows: \n1.  This action concerns Defendants’ prosecution of an unprecedented, unbounded, \nand unlimited trade war impacting over $500 billion in imports from the People’s Republic of \nChina. This Complaint focuses on Defendants’ unlawful escalation of that trade war through the \nimposition of a third and fourth round of tariffs on products covered by so-called “List 3,” and so-\ncalled “List 4a.” Notice of Modification of Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and \nPractices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 83 Fed. Reg. \n47,974 (Sept. 21, 2018); Notice of Modification of Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and \nPractices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. \n43,304 (Aug. 20, 2019); Notice of Modification of Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 2 of 23\nPractices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. \n45,821 (Aug. 30, 2019).  \n2.  The Trade Act of 1974 (“Trade Act”) did not confer authority on Defendants to \nprosecute a vast trade war for however long, and by whatever means, they choose. The United \nStates Trade Representative (“USTR”) conducted an investigation into China’s unfair intellectual \nproperty policies and practices pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. § 2411). \nSection 304 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. § 2414) required USTR to determine what action to take, \nif any, within 12 months after initiation of that investigation. But USTR failed to issue List 3 (or \nsubsequent List 4a) within that window. USTR may not fall back on its “modification” authority \nunder Section 307 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. § 2417) to salvage List 3 (or subsequent List 4a). \nSection 307 of the Trade Act does not permit USTR to expand the imposition of tariffs to other \nimports from China for reasons untethered to the unfair intellectual property policies and practices \nit originally investigated under Section 301 of the Trade Act. Yet that is exactly what Defendants \ndid here when they promulgated the List 3 and List 4a duties in response to China’s retaliatory \nduties and other unrelated issues. And even if USTR deems the existing tariffs “no longer \nappropriate,” as it also did here, the Trade Act permits USTR only to delay, taper, or terminate—\nnot ratchet up—the actions it has already taken. \n3.  The arbitrary manner in which Defendants implemented the List 3 and List 4a tariff \naction also violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). USTR (1) failed to provide \nsufficient opportunity for comment, e.g., requiring interested parties to submit affirmative and \nrebuttal comments on the same day; (2) failed to consider relevant factors when making its \ndecision, e.g., undertaking no analysis of the supposed “increased burden” imposed on U.S. \ncommerce from the unfair policies and practices that it originally investigated; and (3) failed to \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 3 of 23\nconnect the record facts to the choices it made. Indeed, despite receiving over 6,000 comments, \nUSTR said absolutely nothing about how those comments shaped its final promulgation of List 3 \nand List 4a. USTR’s preordained decision-making bears no resemblance to the standards that the \nAPA demands. \n4.  The  Court  should  set  aside  Defendants’  actions  as  ultra  vires  and  otherwise \ncontrary to law, as well as order Defendants to refund (with interest) any duties paid by Plaintiffs \npursuant to List 3 and/or List 4a.  \nJURISDICTION \n5.  The Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B), which confers “exclusive jurisdiction” to the Court over “any civil action \ncommenced against the United States, its agencies, or its officers, that arises out of any law of the \nUnited States providing for … tariffs, duties, fees, or other taxes on the importation of merchandise \nfor reasons other than the raising of revenue.” 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B). \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiffs GK INDUSTRIES AMERICA, INC. AND GK INDUSTRIES LTD., or \n“Plaintiffs”) is a Canada based designer and manufacturer of filtration solutions, providing high-\nquality air, breather, cabin air, fuel, transmission, and oil filters to the North American market. \nPlaintiffs has made numerous entries of merchandise under HTSUS subheadings which are subject \nto additional duties under List 3 and/or List 4a. Plaintiffs has paid additional duties under List 3 \nand/or 4a on these entries.  \n7.  Defendant  United  States  of  America  received  the  disputed  tariffs  and  is  the \nstatutory defendant under 5 U.S.C. § 702 and 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B). \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 4 of 23\n8.  The USTR is an executive agency of the United States charged with investigating \na  foreign  country’s  trade  practices  under  Section  301  of  the  Trade  Act  and  implementing \n“appropriate” responses, subject to the direction of the President. USTR conducted the Section \n301 investigation at issue and made numerous decisions regarding List 3 and List 4a. \n9.  Defendant U.S. Customs & Border Protection (“CBP”) is the agency that collects \nduties on imports. CBP collected payments made by Plaintiffs to account for the tariffs imposed \nby USTR under List 3 and List 4a. \nSTANDING \n10.  Plaintiffs have standing to sue because it is “adversely affected or aggrieved by \nagency action within the meaning of” the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 702; see 28 U.S.C. § 2631(i) (“Any \ncivil action of which the Court of International Trade has jurisdiction … may be commenced in \nthe court by any person adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of \nSection 702 of title 5.”). Tariffs imposed by Defendants pursuant to List 3 and/or List 4a adversely \naffected and aggrieved Plaintiffs because it was required to pay these unlawful duties. \nTIMELINESS OF THE ACTION \n11.  A Plaintiffs must commence an action under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B) “within two \nyears after the cause of action first accrues.” 28 U.S.C. § 2636(i). \n12.  The instant action contests action taken by Defendants that resulted in List 3. Notice \nof Modification of Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology \nTransfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 83 Fed. Reg. 47,974 (Sept. 21, 2018). This case \nis timely filed for all entries on which Section 301 duties were paid under List 3 and/or List 4a, \nincluding but not limited to those duties paid in the two years prior to the filing of this action. This \naction also contests actions taken by Defendants that resulted in List 4a. Notice of Modification of \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 5 of 23\nSection 301 Action: China’s Acts,  Policies, and Practices Related to  Technology Transfer, \nIntellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 43,304 (Aug. 20, 2019); Notice of Modification \nof Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, \nIntellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 45,821 (Aug. 30, 2019). Plaintiffs has therefore \ntimely filed this action. \nRELEVANT LAW \n13.  Section 301 of the Trade Act authorizes USTR to investigate a foreign country’s \ntrade  practices.  19  U.S.C.  §  2411(b).  If  the  investigation  reveals  an  “unreasonable  or \ndiscriminatory” practice, USTR may take “appropriate” action, such as imposing tariffs on imports \nfrom the country that administered the unfair practice. Id. § 2411(b), (c)(1)(B). \n14.  Section 304 of the Trade Act requires USTR to determine what action to take, if \nany, within 12 months after the initiation of the underlying investigation. Id. § 2414(a)(1)(B), \n(2)(B). \n15.  Section 307 of the Trade Act (in pertinent part) allows USTR to “modify or \nterminate” an action taken pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act either when the “burden or \nrestriction on United States commerce” imposed by the investigated foreign country’s practice has \n“increased or decreased” or when the action “is no longer appropriate.” Id. § 2417(a)(1)(B), (C). \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nI.  USTR’s Investigation \n16.  The current U.S.-China trade war grew from a narrow dispute. On August 14, 2017, \nformer President Trump directed former Ambassador Lighthizer to consider initiating a targeted \ninvestigation pursuant to Section 301(b) of the Trade Act concerning China’s laws, policies, \npractices, and actions related to intellectual property, innovation, and technology. Addressing \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 6 of 23\nChina’s Laws, Policies, Practices, and Actions Related to Intellectual Property, Innovation, and \nTechnology, 82 Fed. Reg. 39,007 (Aug. 17, 2017). According to the former President, certain \nChinese  “laws,  policies,  practices,  and  actions”  on  intellectual  property,  innovation,  and \ntechnology “may inhibit United States exports, deprive United States citizens of fair remuneration \nfor their innovations, divert American jobs to workers in China, contribute to our trade deficit with \nChina, and otherwise undermine American manufacturing, services, and innovation.” Id. \n17.  Four days later, on August 18, 2017, USTR formally initiated an investigation into \n“whether acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, \nintellectual property, and innovation are actionable under [Section 301(b) of] the Trade Act.” \nInitiation of Section 301 Investigation; Hearing; and Request for Public Comments: China’s Acts, \nPolicies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 82 \nFed. Reg. 40,213 (Aug. 24, 2017). \n18.  Seven months later, on March 22, 2018, USTR released a report announcing the \nresults of its investigation. OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE, \nFindings of the Investigation Into China’s Acts, Policies, And Practices Related to Technology \nTransfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation Under Section 301 of The Trade Act of 1974 (Mar. \n22, 2018), available at https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Section%20301%20FINAL.PDF. USTR \nfound that certain “acts, policies, and practices of the Chinese government related to technology \ntransfer, intellectual property, and innovation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or \nrestrict U.S. commerce.” Id. at 17. USTR based its findings on (1) China’s use of foreign \nownership restrictions, foreign investment restrictions, and administrative licensing and approval \nprocesses to pressure technology transfers from U.S. to Chinese companies, id. at 45; (2) China’s \nuse of licensing processes to transfer technologies from U.S. to Chinese companies on terms that \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 7 of 23\nfavor Chinese recipients, id. at 48; (3) China’s facilitation of systematic investment in, and \nacquisition  of,  U.S.  companies  and  assets  by  Chinese  entities  to  obtain  technologies  and \nintellectual property for purposes of large-scale technology transfer, id. at 147; and (4) China’s \ncyber intrusions into U.S. computer networks to gain access to valuable business information, id. \nat 171. In its report, USTR did not quantify the burden or restriction imposed on U.S. commerce \nby the investigated practices. \n19.  On the same date, USTR published a “Fact Sheet” stating that “[a]n interagency \nteam of subject matter experts and economists estimates that China’s policies result in harm to the \nU.S. economy of at least $50 billion per year.” OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE \nREPRESENTATIVE, Section 301 Fact Sheet (Mar. 22, 2018), available at https://ustr.gov/about-\nus/policy-offices/press-office/fact-sheets/2018/march/Section-301-fact-sheet.  USTR  also \nindicated that, consistent with a directive from  former President Trump, it would “propose \nadditional tariffs” of 25% ad valorem “on certain products of China, with an annual trade value \ncommensurate with the harm caused to the U.S. economy resulting from China’s unfair policies.” \nId. See also, Actions by the United States Related to the Section 301 Investigation of China’s Laws, \nPolicies,  Practices,  or  Actions  Related  to  Technology  Transfer,  Intellectual  Property,  and \nInnovation, 83 Fed. Reg. 13,099 (Mar. 27, 2018) (former President Trump’s directive). \nII.  Lists 1 & 2 \n20.  Between April and August 2018 (i.e., within the 12-month statutory deadline from \nthe initiation of the investigation in August 2017, see 19 U.S.C. § 2414(a)(2)(B)), Defendants \nundertook a series of actions to remedy the estimated harm to the U.S. economy caused by the \ninvestigated unfair practices, ultimately imposing duties on imports from China covered by the so-\ncalled Lists 1 and 2. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 8 of 23\n21.  On April 6, 2018, USTR published notice of its intent to impose “an additional duty \nof 25 percent on a list of products of Chinese origin.” Notice of Determination and Request for \nPublic Comment Concerning Proposed Determination of Action Pursuant to Section 301: China’s \nActs,  Policies,  and  Practices  Related  to  Technology  Transfer,  Intellectual  Property,  and \nInnovation, 83 Fed. Reg. 14,906, 14,907 (Apr. 6, 2018). The products on the proposed list covered \n1,333 tariff subheadings with a total value of “approximately $50 billion in terms of estimated \nannual trade value for calendar year 2018.” Id. at 14,907. USTR explained that it chose $50 billion \nbecause that amount was “commensurate with an economic analysis of the harm caused by China’s \nunreasonable technology transfer policies to the U.S. economy, as covered by USTR’s Section 301 \ninvestigation.”  OFFICE  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES  TRADE  REPRESENTATIVE,  Under \nSection 301 Action, USTR Releases Proposed Tariff List on Chinese Products (Apr. 3, 2018), \navailable at https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/april/under-\nsection-301-action-ustr. \n22.  On June 20, 2018, USTR published notice of its final list of products subject to an \nadditional duty of 25% ad valorem, a list commonly known as “List 1.” Notice of Action and \nRequest for Public Comment Concerning Proposed Determination of Action Pursuant to Section \n301: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, \nand Innovation, 83 Fed. Reg. 28,710 (June 20, 2018). USTR explained that it had “narrow[ed] the \nproposed list in the April 6, 2018 notice to 818 tariff subheadings, with an approximate annual \ntrade value of $34 billion.” Id. at 28,711. \n23.  At the same time that it finalized List 1, USTR announced that it intended to impose \na 25% ad valorem duty on a second proposed list of Chinese products in order to “maintain the \neffectiveness of [the] $50 billion trade action” grounded in its Section 301 investigation. Id. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 9 of 23\nat 28,712. USTR announced a proposed  “List 2” covering 284 tariff  subheadings with  “an \napproximate annual trade value of $16 billion.” Id. at 28,711-12. \n24.  On August 16, 2018, USTR published notice of the final list of products subject to \nan additional duty of 25% ad valorem in List 2, comprising “279 tariff subheadings” whose \n“annual  trade  value … remains  approximately  $16  billion.”  Notice  of  Action  Pursuant  to \nSection 301: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual \nProperty, and Innovation, 83 Fed. Reg. 40,823, 40,823-24 (Aug. 16, 2018). \nIII.  List 3 and List 4 \n25.  As soon as USTR announced the results of its investigation in March 2018, tensions \nbetween the governments of China and the United States escalated dramatically. In the months \nthat followed, Defendants wildly expanded the scope of the tariffs imposed under Section 301 of \nthe Trade Act to cover imports worth more than $500 billion—ten times the amount it had deemed \n“commensurate” with the findings of USTR’s original investigation. Defendants did so for reasons \nuntethered  to  the  unfair  practices  that  USTR  had  investigated,  namely  China’s  tit-for-tat \ncountermeasures and a hodgepodge of grievances related to China’s role on the world stage. \nA.  List 3 \n26.  Shortly after former President Trump directed USTR in April 2018 to consider \nimposing  duties  on  $50  billion  in  Chinese  products,  China  promptly  threatened  to  impose \nretaliatory duties on the same value of imports from the United States. In response, former \nPresident Trump “instructed the USTR to consider whether $100 billion of additional tariffs would \nbe appropriate under Section 301” due to “China’s unfair retaliation.” THE WHITE HOUSE, \nStatement from Donald J. Trump on Additional Proposed Section 301 Remedies (Apr. 5, 2018), \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 10 of 23\navailable  at  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-\ntrump-additional -proposed-section-301-remedies/. \n27.  Shortly after former President Trump directed USTR in April 2018 to consider \nimposing  duties  on  $50  billion  in  Chinese  products,  China  promptly  threatened  to  impose \nretaliatory duties on the same value of imports from the United States. In response, former \nPresident Trump “instructed the USTR to consider whether $100 billion of additional tariffs would \nbe appropriate under Section 301” due to “China’s unfair retaliation.” THE WHITE HOUSE, \nStatement from Donald J.

Following through on his warning, on June 18, 2018, former President Trump \nformally directed USTR to consider whether the United States should impose additional duties on \nproducts from China with an estimated trade value of $200 billion—despite USTR having not yet \nimplemented List 1 and List 2. Former President Trump acknowledged that China’s threatened \nretaliatory “tariffs on $50 billion worth of United States exports” motivated his decision. THE \nWHITE HOUSE, Statement from the President Regarding Trade with China (June 18, 2018), \navailable  at  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-regarding-\ntrade-china-2/ (“This latest action by China clearly indicates its determination to keep the United \nStates at a permanent and unfair disadvantage, which is reflected in our massive $376 billion trade \nimbalance in goods. This is unacceptable.”). \n29.  Acknowledging the purpose of the former President’s directive, USTR stated that \nit would design the newly proposed duties to address China’s threatened retaliatory measures, \nrather than any of the harms identified in its Section 301 investigation. OFFICE OF THE UNITED \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 11 of 23\nSTATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE, USTR Robert Lighthizer Statement on the President’s \nAdditional China Trade Action (June 18, 2018), available at https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-\noffices/press-office/press-releases/2018/june/ustr-robert-lighthizer-statement-0  (explaining  that, \nalthough Lists 1 and 2 “were proportionate and responsive to forced technology transfer and \nintellectual property theft by the Chinese” identified in the Section 301 investigation, the proposed \nduties for a third list of products were necessary to respond to the retaliatory and “unjustified \ntariffs” that China may impose to target “U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses”). \n30.  Despite these warnings from Defendants, China retaliated by imposing 25% ad \nvalorem tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods implemented in two stages of $34 billion and \n$16 billion on the same dates the United States began collecting its own 25% tariffs under List 1 \n(July 6, 2018) and List 2 (August 23, 2018). \n31.  About a week after China imposed its first round of retaliatory duties, USTR \npublished notice of its proposal to “modify the action in this investigation by maintaining the \noriginal  $34  billion  action  and  the  proposed  $16  billion  action,  and  by  taking  a  further, \nsupplemental action” in the form of “an additional 10 percent ad valorem duty on [a list of] \nproducts [from] China with an annual trade value of approximately $200 billion.” Request for \nComments Concerning Proposed Modification of Action Pursuant to Section 301: China’s Acts, \nPolicies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 83 \nFed. Reg. 33,608, 33,608 (July 17, 2018). USTR invoked Section 307(a)(1)(C) of the Trade Act, \npursuant to which USTR “may modify or terminate any action, subject to the specific direction, if \nany, of the President with respect to such action, … if … such action is being taken under [Section \n301(b)] of this title and is no longer appropriate.” Id. at 33,609 (citing 19 U.S.C. § 2417(a)(1)(c)). \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 12 of 23\nUSTR initially set a deadline of August 17, 2018 for initial comments; August 20-23, 2018 for a \npublic hearing; and August 30, 2018 for rebuttal comments. Id. at 33,608. \n32.  In its notice, USTR confirmed that it had relied on China’s decision to impose \n“retaliatory duties” as the primary basis for its proposed action. Id. at 33,609 (asserting as \njustification “China’s response to the $50 billion action announced in the investigation and its \nrefusal to change its acts, policies, and practices”). USTR explicitly tied the $200 billion in its \nproposed action to the level of retaliatory duties imposed by China on U.S. imports, noting that \n“action at this level is appropriate in light of the level of China’s announced retaliatory action \n($50 billion) and the level of Chinese goods imported into the United States ($505 billion in \n2017).” Id.; see also id. (Because “China’s retaliatory action covers a substantial percentage of \nU.S. goods exported to China ($130 billion in 2017),” “the level of the U.S. supplemental action \nmust  cover  a  substantial  percentage  of  Chinese  imports.”).  Although  it  pointed  to  China’s \nretaliatory  measures,  USTR  did  not  identify  any  increased  burdens  or  restrictions  on  U.S. \ncommerce resulting from the unfair practices that USTR had investigated. See id. \n33.  USTR’s contemporaneous press statements corroborated the contents of its notice: \nChina’s retaliatory duties motivated its proposed action. Former Ambassador Lighthizer stated that \nthe proposed action came “[a]s a result of China’s retaliation and failure to change its practice.” \nOFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE, Statement by U.S. Trade \nRepresentative  Robert  Lighthizer  on  Section  301  Action  (July  10,  2018),  available  at \nhttps://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/july/statement-us-trade-\nrepresentative. \n34.  That same day, former President Trump suggested that the United States’ trade \nimbalance with China supported the decision. @realDonaldTrump, TWITTER (July 10, 2018, \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 13 of 23\n9:17  PMEDT),  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1005982266496094209.  Over  the \nfollowing weeks, the former President also expressed his frustration over China’s purported \nmanipulation of its currency and national monetary policy, as well as his continued displeasure \nover China’s retaliatory tariffs and the trade imbalance between the two nations.  See, e.g., \n@realDonaldTrump,  Twitter  (July  20,  2018,  8:43  AM  EDT), \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1020287981020729344;  @realDonaldTrump, \nTWITTER  (July  20,  2018,  8:51  AM  EDT),  https://twitter.com/realDonald \nTrump/status/1020290163933630464; @realDonaldTrump, TWITTER (July 25, 2018, 7:20 AM \nEDT), https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1022079127799701504; @realDonaldTrump, \nTwitter (July 25, 2018, 7:01  AM EDT), https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1022074 \n252999225344. \n35.  Within days of these statements, former Ambassador Lighthizer announced that, in \nlight of China’s retaliatory duties, USTR would propose to increase the additional duty from 10% \nto 25% ad valorem. Rather than addressing the practices that USTR investigated pursuant to \nSection 301 of the Trade Act, he stated that China “[r]egrettably … has illegally retaliated against \nU.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses.” OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE \nREPRESENTATIVE, Statement by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Section 301 \nAction (Aug. 1, 2018),  available at https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-\nreleases/2018/august/state ment-us-trade-representative. \n36.  Shortly thereafter, USTR, at the direction of former President Trump, formally \nproposed “raising the level of the additional duty in the proposed supplemental action from 10 \npercent to 25 percent.” Extension of Public Comment Period Concerning Proposed Modification \nof Action Pursuant to Section 301: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 14 of 23\nTransfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,760, 38,760 (Aug. 7, 2018). \nUSTR also set new dates for a public hearing over six days ending on August 27, 2018. See id.; \nsee also OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE, Public Hearings on \nProposed Section 301 Tariff List (Aug. 17, 2018) (modifying hearing schedule), available at \nhttps://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/august/public-hearings-\nproposed-section-301. \n37.  At the same time, USTR adjusted the deadlines for the submission of written \ncomments, setting September 6, 2018—less than a month later—as the new deadline for both \ninitial and rebuttal comments from the public. 83 Fed. Reg. at 38,761. That adjustment, deviating \nfrom its past practices, prevented both USTR and the public from considering initial comments at \nthe hearing, and left insufficient time for interested parties to review and respond to the initial \ncomments filed by other parties. USTR also limited each hearing participant to five minutes. \nDocket  No.  USTR-2018-0026,  https://beta.regulations.gov/document/USTR-2018-0026-0001. \nDespite those obstacles, approximately 350 witnesses appeared at the six-day hearing, and the \npublic submitted over 6,000 comments. Id.  \n38.  Just eleven days after receiving final comments from the public, former President \nTrump announced that he had directed USTR “to proceed with placing additional tariffs on roughly \n$200 billion  of  imports  from  China.”  THE  WHITE  HOUSE,  Statement  from  the  President \n(Sep. 17, 2018) https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-\n4/. Once again, the former President made clear that China’s response to the $50 billion tariff \naction (i.e., List 1 and List 2 duties) motived his decision, and he immediately promised to proceed \nwith  “phase three”  of  the  plan—an  additional  $267  billion  tariff  action—“if  China  takes \nretaliatory action against our farmers or other industries.” Id. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 15 of 23\n39.  Following the former President’s announcement, USTR published notice of the \nfinal list of products subject to an additional duty, a list commonly known as “List 3.” 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 47,974. USTR imposed a 10% ad valorem tariff that was set to rise automatically to 25% on \nJanuary 1, 2019. Id. USTR determined that the List 3 duties would apply to all listed products that \nenter the United States from China on or after September 24, 2018. Id. USTR did not respond to \nany of the over 6,000 comments that it received or any of the testimony provided by roughly 350 \nwitnesses. Id. \n40.  As legal support for its action, USTR for the first time cited Section 307(a)(1)(B) \nof the Trade Act, which provides that USTR “may modify or terminate any action, subject to the \nspecific direction … of the President … taken under Section 301 if … the burden or restriction on \nUnited States commerce of the denial of rights, or of the acts, policies, or practices, that are the \nsubject of such action has increased or decreased.” Id. (brackets omitted). USTR stated that the \nrelevant burden “continues to increase, including following the one-year investigation period,” \nadding that “China’s unfair acts, policies, and practices include not just its specific technology \ntransfer and IP polices referenced in the notice of initiation in the investigation, but also China’s \nsubsequent  defensive  actions  taken  to  maintain  those  policies.”  Id.  USTR  also  cited \nSection 307(a)(1)(C) of the Trade Act, arguing that China’s response to the $50 billion tariff action \n“has shown that the current action no longer is appropriate” because “China openly has responded \nto the current action by choosing to cause further harm to the U.S. economy, by increasing duties \non U.S. exports to China.” Id. at 47,975. \n41.  In the months that followed, China and the United States attempted to resolve their \ndifferences  through  trade  negotiations.  Based  on  the  progress  made  with  China  in  those \nnegotiations, the former Administration of President Trump announced in December 2018, and \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 16 of 23\nagain in February 2019, that it would delay the scheduled increase in the List 3 duty rate from 10 \nto 25%. Notice of Modification of Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices \nRelated to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 83 Fed. Reg. 65,198 (Dec. \n19, 2018); Notice of Modification of Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices \nRelated to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 7,966 (Mar. \n5, 2019). \n42.  The trade negotiations ultimately fell apart. In May 2019, USTR announced its \nintent to raise the tariff rate on List 3 goods to 25%, effective either May 10, 2019 or June 1, 2019, \ndepending on the day of export. See Notice of Modification of Section 301 Action: China's Acts, \nPolicies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 \nFed.  Reg.  20,459  (May  9,  2019)  (“List  3  Rate  Increase  Notice”);  see  also  Implementing \nModification to Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology \nTransfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 21,892 (May 15, 2019). The notice \ncited China’s decision to “retreat from specific commitments agreed to in earlier rounds” of \nnegotiations as the basis for the increase in the duty rate. List 3 Rate Increase Notice, 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 20,459. Unlike with past imposition of new tariffs, USTR did not seek public comment but \nrather simply announced that the increase would occur. Id. \n43.  Recognizing that List 3 would cause substantial harm to U.S. companies and \nconsumers, as well as the U.S. economy, USTR in June 2019 invited the public to seek exclusions \nfrom List 3 duties on a product-specific basis. Procedures for Requests to Exclude Particular \nProducts From the September 2018 Action Pursuant to Section 301: China’s Acts, Policies, and \nPractices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. \n29,576 (June 24, 2019).  \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 17 of 23\n44.  The duties imposed on products covered by List 3 remain in effect as of the date of \nthis Complaint, with the exception of the limited number of products for which USTR has granted \nexclusions from the List 3 duties. \nB.  List 4 \n45.  On May 17, 2019, a mere eight days after it published notice of its decision to \nincrease the duty rate on imports covered by List 3, USTR announced its intent to proceed with \nyet another list—List 4—covering even more products subject to additional duties. Under USTR’s \nproposal,  List  4  would  impose  an  additional  duty  of  25%  ad  valorem  on  products  worth \n$300 billion. Request for Comments Concerning Proposed Modification of Action Pursuant to \nSection 301: China's Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual \nProperty, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 22,564, 22,564 (May 17, 2019). USTR explained that its \ndecision was motivated by China’s “retreat[] from specific commitments made in  previous \n[negotiating] rounds [and] announce[ment of] further retaliatory action against U.S. commerce.” \nId. \n46.  Similar to the process it followed for List 3, USTR invited the public to comment \non proposed List 4 and participate in a hearing. Id. The public submitted nearly 3,000 comments. \nDocket  No.  USTR-2019-0004,  https://beta.regulations.gov/document/USTR-2019-0004-0001. \nDespite the opportunity to comment, the timeline for participation in the hearing left little room \nfor meaningful input: USTR required witnesses to submit drafts of their testimony by June 10, \n2019, some seven days before the deadline for fully developed written comments, and then it again \nlimited witnesses to five minutes of testimony at the hearing. Id. \n47.  On  August  1,  2019,  citing  China’s  failure  to  follow  through  on  agricultural \npurchases and to reduce exports of fentanyl flowing into the United States, former President Trump \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 18 of 23\nannounced that the List 4 tariffs would become effective September 1, 2019 at a rate of 10% ad \nvalorem. @realDonaldTrump, TWITTER (Aug. 1, 2019, 1:26 PM EDT), https://twitter.com/real \nDonaldTrump/status/1156979446877962243 (noting a “small additional Tariff of 10% on the \nremaining 300 Billion Dollars of goods and products coming from China into our Country”). \n48.  On August 20, 2019, USTR issued a final notice adopting List 4 in two tranches. \nNotice of Modification of Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to \nTechnology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 43,304 (Aug. 20, 2019). \nList 4A would impose a 10% ad valorem duty on goods worth roughly $120 billion, effective \nSeptember 1, 2019. Id. at 43,304. List 4B would impose a 10% ad valorem duty on the remaining \ngoods (with limited exclusions “based on health, safety, national security, and other factors”), \neffective December 15, 2019. Id. at 43,305. Once again, USTR did not address any of the nearly \n3,000 comments submitted or any of the testimony provided by witnesses, other than to claim that \nits determination “takes account of the public comments and the testimony.” Id. \n49.  As legal support for its action, USTR again cited Section 307(a)(1)(B) and (C) of \nthe Trade Act, stating that it may modify its prior action taken pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade \nAct if (1) “[t]he burden or restriction on United States commerce” imposed by the investigated \nforeign  country  practice  “has  increased  or  decreased,”  or  (2)  “the  action … is  no  longer \nappropriate.” Id. at 43,304. But instead of finding any increased burden on U.S. commerce from \nthe practices that were the subject of USTR’s investigation, USTR merely pointed to “China’s \nsubsequent  defensive actions taken to  maintain those unfair acts,  policies, and practices as \ndetermined in that investigation,” including retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, retreating from \ncommitments during negotiations, and devaluing its currency. Id. \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 19 of 23\n50.  Just ten days later, USTR published notice of its decision to increase the tariff rate \napplicable to goods covered by List 4A and List 4B from 10% to 15%. Notice of Modification of \nSection 301 Action: China’s Acts,  Policies, and Practices Related to  Technology Transfer, \nIntellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 45,821 (Aug. 30, 2019). USTR explained that \nit increased the tariff rate because, shortly after it finalized List 4A and List 4B, “China responded \nby announcing further tariffs on U.S. goods.” Id. at 45,822. USTR once again cited to China’s \nretreat from its negotiation commitments and devaluation of its currency as grounds for its action. \nId. \n51.  On December 18, 2019, as a result of successfully negotiating a limited trade deal \nwith China, USTR published notice that it would “suspend indefinitely the imposition of additional \nduties of 15 percent on products of China covered by” List 4B. Notice of Modification of Section \n301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual \nProperty, and Innovation, 84 Fed. Reg. 69,447, 69,447 (Dec. 18, 2019). USTR also stated its intent \nto reduce the tariff rate applicable to products covered by List 4A, id., an action that ultimately \nbecame effective on February 14, 2020, when USTR halved the applicable duty rate, Notice of \nModification of Section 301 Action: China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology \nTransfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 85 Fed. Reg. 3,741 (Jan. 22, 2020). \n52.  In the months that followed, the United States and China implemented the limited \ntrade deal that they negotiated near the end of 2019. OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE \nREPRESENTATIVE, United States and China Reach Phase One Trade Agreement (Dec. 13, \n2019), https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2019/december/united-\nstates-and-china-reach. During that time, Defendants declined to impose additional duties on \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 20 of 23\nimports covered by List 4B, presumably because China had agreed to some new, unrelated \nobligations under the limited trade deal. \n53.  The duties imposed on products covered by List 4A remain in effect as of the date \nof this Complaint. Although the proposed duties on products covered by List 4B remain suspended, \nformer President Trump has continued to threaten to impose them if China does not meet its \nobligations under their limited trade deal. See, e.g., @realDonaldTrump, TWITTER (June 22, \n2020, 10:22 PM EDT), https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1275252814206447618 (“The \nChina Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the \nAgreement!”). \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \nCOUNT ONE \n(DECLARATORY JUDGMENT—VIOLATION OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974) \n54.  Paragraphs 1 through 53 are incorporated by reference. \n55.  The Declaratory Judgment Act authorizes any court of the United States to “declare \nthe rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not \nfurther relief is or could be sought.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n56.  The Trade Act of 1974 does not authorize the actions taken by Defendants that \nresulted in the List 3 and List 4a tariffs. \n57.  Pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act, USTR may impose tariffs when it \ndetermines that “an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country is unreasonable or discriminatory \nand burdens or restricts United States commerce, and action by the United States is appropriate.” \n19 U.S.C. § 2411(b). USTR failed to predicate its action giving rise to List 3 and List 4a on any \nsuch determination. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 21 of 23\n58.  If USTR concludes upon investigation that a foreign country maintains an unfair \ntrade practice, Section 304 of the Trade Act requires USTR to “determine what action, if any,” to \ntake  within  “12  months  after  the  date  on  which  the  investigation  is  initiated.”  19  U.S.C. \n§ 2414(a)(1)(B), (2)(B). USTR’s action giving rise to List 3 occurred in September 2018, over a \nyear after USTR initiated the underlying Section 301 investigation on August 18, 2017. USTR’s \nactions giving rise to List 4a occurred in August 2019, more than two years after USTR initiated \nthe underlying Section 301 investigation. \n59.  Section 307 of the Trade Act authorizes USTR to “modify or terminate” an action \ntaken pursuant to Section 301(b) of the Trade Act when the burden imposed on U.S. commerce \nfrom the foreign country’s investigated unfair acts, policies, or practices increases or decreases. 19 \nU.S.C. § 2417(a)(1)(B). Section 307 of the Trade Act, however, does not permit Defendants to \nincrease tariffs for reasons unrelated to the acts, policies, or practices that USTR investigated \npursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act. Congress did not authorize USTR to escalate its focused \ninvestigatory findings into an open-ended trade war. \n60.  Section 307 of the Trade Act also authorizes USTR to “modify or terminate” an \naction taken pursuant to Section 301(b) of the Trade Act if the initial action taken by USTR “is no \nlonger appropriate.” 19 U.S.C. § 2417(a)(1)(C). Section 307 of the Trade Act does not authorize \nDefendants to increase tariff actions that are no longer “appropriate,” but rather only to delay, \ntaper, or terminate such actions. \n61.  Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ actions \ngiving rise to List 3 and List 4a are ultra vires and contrary to law. \n   \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 22 of 23\nCOUNT TWO \n(VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT) \n62.  Paragraphs 1 through 61 are incorporated by reference. \n63.  The APA authorizes the Court to hold unlawful and set aside agency action that is: \n“(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; \n(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; (D) without observance of \nprocedure required by law; [or] (E) unsupported by substantial evidence.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n64.  Defendants exceeded their authority under the Trade Act in promulgating List 3 \nand List 4a and therefore acted “not in accordance with the law” and “in excess of statutory \nauthority” for the reasons set forth in Count One. \n65.  Defendants failed to offer any evidence for any asserted “increased burden” from \nChina’s intellectual property policies and practices that were the subject of USTR’s Section 301 \ninvestigation. \n66.  Defendants also promulgated List 3 and List 4a in an arbitrary and capricious \nmanner because they did not provide a sufficient opportunity for comment, failed to meaningfully \nconsider relevant factors when making their decisions, and failed to adequately explain their \nrationale. Defendants’ preordained decision-making resulted in the unlawful imposition of tariffs \non imports covered by List 3 whose value equals $200 billion and List 4a whose value equals \n$120 billion. \n*      *      * \n   \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00087-N/A     Document 2      Filed 05/14/25      Page 23 of 23\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully requests that this Court: \n(1) declare that Defendants’ actions resulting in tariffs on products covered by List 3 and \nList 4a are unauthorized by, and contrary to, the Trade Act; \n(2) declare that Defendants arbitrarily and unlawfully promulgated List 3 and List 4a in \nviolation of the APA; \n(3) order Defendants to refund, with interest, any duties paid by Plaintiffs pursuant to List 3 \nand List 4a; \n(4) permanently enjoin Defendants from applying List 3 and List 4a against Plaintiffs and \ncollecting any duties from Plaintiffs pursuant to List 3 and List 4a; \n(5) award Plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorney fees; and \n(6) grant such other and further relief as may be just and proper. \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \nNEVILLE PETERSON LLP \n   \n    \n  /s/ John M.
