Plaintiffs—Do No Harm; Students for Fair Admissions; and Kelly Ma-\n2 \n3  honey, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated—bring this civil action \n4 \nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title IV of the Civil \n5 \nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §1981, and the Unruh Civil Rights Act to stop the David \n6 \n7  Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and various UCLA officials from engaging in \n8 \nintentional discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity in the admissions process.  \n9 \n2.  In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court reminded universities what has always \n10 \n11  been true: “Racial discrimination is invidious in all contexts.” SFFA v. Harvard, 600 \n12 \nU.S. 181, 214 (2023) (cleaned up). The right to “public education ‘must be made avail-\n13 \nable to all on equal terms’” without regard to race. Id. at 204 (quoting Brown v. Bd. of \n14 \n15  Educ., 493 U.S. 483, 493 (1954)). Race-based admissions “demean[] the dignity and \n16 \nworth of a person” by judging them “by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit \n17 \nand essential qualities.” Id. at 220 (cleaned up). The U.S. Constitution prohibits public \n18 \nuniversities from using race “as a factor in affording educational opportunities.” Id. at \n19 \n20 \n204.   \n21 \n3.  But UCLA didn’t need that reminder. Long before Harvard, the people \n22 \nof California passed Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race in uni-\n23 \n24  versity admissions. The California Constitution now unambiguously states: “The State \n25 \nshall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  3 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 4 of 38   Page ID #:4\n \n1  group on the basis of race … in the operation of … public education.” Cal. Const. art. \n2 \nI, §31(a).   \n3 \n4.  But California’s universities have never liked Prop 209, at least the part \n4 \n5  that bans them from giving admissions preferences to blacks. The University of Cali-\n6 \nfornia System has campaigned for Prop 209’s repeal. And behind the scenes, its admis-\n7 \nsions offices have reintroduced the intentional consideration of race.     \n8 \n5.  Indeed, the UC System’s illegal use of race is currently being challenged \n9 \n10 \nin another case pending before this Court. Students Against Racial Discrimination v. Regents \n11 \nof the Univ. of Cal., No. 8:25-cv-192-JWH-JDE (C.D. Cal.). \n12 \n6.  UCLA’s medical school has adopted an “Anti-Racism Roadmap,” under \n13 \n14  which it racially balances its medical-student population.  \n15 \n7.  Consistent with its racial goals, Geffen made Jennifer Lucero dean of ad-\n16 \nmissions in 2020. Lucero is an outspoken advocate for using race to make admission \n17 \n18  and hiring decisions in medical schools and hospitals. As dean of admissions, Lucero \n19 \nwields significant influence over Geffen’s admissions policies and practices, the ap-\n20 \npointment of the admissions committee members, the committee’s deliberations, and \n21 \n22  admission decisions.  \n23 \n8.  Whistleblowers with first-hand knowledge of Lucero’s admissions prac-\n24 \ntices have now come forward. They report that, under the guise of “holistic” review, \n25 \n26  Geffen requires applicants to submit responses that are intended to allow the Com-\n27 \nmittee to glean the applicant’s race, which the medical school later confirms via \n28 \n  4 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 5 of 38   Page ID #:5\n \n1  interviews. Lucero and her handpicked committee members routinely and openly dis-\n2 \ncuss race (and racial proxies) and use race as a factor to make admission decisions. \n3 \nLucero berates and belittles committee members who raise concerns about admitting \n4 \n5  minority students because of their race despite low GPAs and MCAT scores. At UCLA \n6 \nMedical School, race is not only a factor but often decisive—above GPA and MCAT \n7 \nscores—in making admission decisions.  \n8 \n9.  The numbers show that UCLA is engaged in intentional racial balancing. \n9 \n10 \nBetween 2020 and 2023, the percentage of white and Asian applicants to Geffen was \n11 \nconsistently around 73% of the total applicant pool. Yet the percentage of matriculants \n12 \nto Geffen who are white and Asian plummeted: 65.7% in 2020, 57.1% in 2021, 57.8% \n13 \n14  in 2022, and 53.7% in 2023. \n15 \n10.  UCLA has withheld key admissions data from the public and its own \n16 \ninternal oversight body. UCLA has also effectively shut down its own internal probe \n17 \n18  into its admissions practices by insisting on non-disclosure agreements from the par-\n19 \nticipants in the admissions process. Geffen’s apparent illegal use of race has even \n20 \nprompted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to begin an investiga-\n21 \n22  tion into its admissions practices.  \n23 \n11.  This much is clear: UCLA’s illegal racial discrimination has harmed and \n24 \nis continuing to harm applicants, including Plaintiffs and their members. In this race-\n25 \n26  based system, all applicants are deprived of their right to equal treatment and the \n27 \n28 \n  5 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 6 of 38   Page ID #:6\n \n1  opportunity to pursue their lifelong dream of becoming a doctor because of utterly \n2 \narbitrary criteria.

Plaintiff  Do  No  Harm  is  a  nationwide  membership  organization  of \n5 \nhealthcare professionals, students, patients, and policymakers who want to protect \n6 \n7  healthcare from radical, divisive, and discriminatory ideologies. Do No Harm’s pur-\n8 \npose is to keep these ideologies out of medical education, clinical practice, and research \n9 \nfields.  \n10 \n11  13.  Do No Harm has at least one member who applied to Geffen, was re-\n12 \njected, and is able and ready to reapply if a court orders Defendants to stop discrimi-\n13 \nnating and to undo the effects of its past discrimination.  \n14 \n15  14.

UCLA Medical School’s Admissions Process \n19  30.  UCLA Medical School is highly selective. Each year, Geffen receives be-\n20 \ntween 11,000 and 14,000 applicants yet matriculates roughly 175 medical students.  \n21 \n31.  Geffen’s matriculants have an average GPA of 3.8 and average MCAT \n22 \n23  score of 514.  \n24 \n32.  UCLA chooses to let applicants apply to Geffen up to three times total. \n25 \nAnd although medical schools can allow for transfers, Geffen chooses not to accept \n26 \n27  transfers.  \n28 \n  9 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 10 of 38   Page ID #:10\n \n1  33.  Geffen reviews applications and makes admission decisions through its \n2 \nAdmissions  Committee,  which  consists  of  approximately  20-30  faculty  members. \n3 \nCommittee members can serve up to three five-year terms. About five medical students \n4 \n5  also sit on the Admissions Committee to provide input on admission decisions. UCLA \n6 \ndoes not make public who sits on the admissions committee. \n7 \n34.  The Admissions Committee’s application-review process for the tradi-\n8 \ntional M.D. track generally takes place in the following steps: primary application, sec-\n9 \n10 \nondary application, interview, committee deliberation, and decision.   \n11 \n35.  Primary Application. Applicants submit a primary application through \n12 \nthe American Medical College Application Service, which is run by the Association of \n13 \n14  American Medical Colleges.  \n15 \n36.  AMCAS sends the applicant’s primary application to the applicant’s des-\n16 \nignated medical schools. Applicants pay $175 for the first designated school and $46 \n17 \n18  for each subsequently designated school.  \n19 \n37.  The  primary  application  contains  the  applicant’s  biographical  infor-\n20 \nmation (including race), citizenship status, family income, academic background, un-\n21 \n22  dergraduate GPA, MCAT score, internship and volunteer experience, and personal \n23 \nstatement.  \n24 \n38.  Geffen receives an applicant’s primary application through AMCAS and \n25 \n26  uses the primary application to initially screen applicants. It purportedly removes the \n27 \ncheckbox information for race and ethnicity. \n28 \n  10 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 11 of 38   Page ID #:11\n \n1  39.  Geffen requires applicants to take AAMC’s PREview Exam, which at-\n2 \ntempts to measure applicants’ professional readiness and situational judgment. The \n3 \nPREview Exam is a multiple-choice test that purports to measure applicants’ cultural \n4 \n5  awareness, cultural humility, empathy and compassion, and interpersonal skills, among \n6 \nothers. The PREview Exam was created by diversity-affairs officers from various med-\n7 \nical schools, whom AAMC calls its “DEI constituents,” to “level the playing field” for \n8 \napplicants deemed historically underrepresented in medicine. It does so by stressing \n9 \n10 \nfactors other than academics.  \n11 \n40.  It costs $100 to take the PREview Exam. The PREview Exam scores \n12 \ninitially get reported to UCLA as part of the applicant’s primary application. Geffen \n13 \n14  again asks about the PREview Exam in the secondary application. \n15 \n41.  Secondary application. After primary review, select applicants receive an \n16 \ninvitation to submit a UCLA-specific secondary application.  \n17 \n18  42.  The secondary application asks the applicant to submit several open-\n19 \nended responses. For instance, in 2024, Geffen asked a series of questions, including \n20 \nthe following: “Do you identify as being part of a group that has been marginalized \n21 \n22  (examples include, but are not limited to LGBTQIA, disabilities, federally recognized \n23 \ntribe) in terms of access to education or healthcare? If you answered “Yes” …, describe \n24 \nhow this inequity has impacted you or your community and how educational disparity, \n25 \n26  health disparity and/or marginalization has impacted you and your community.” \n27 \n28 \n  11 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 12 of 38   Page ID #:12\n \n1  43.  To submit the secondary application, the applicant must pay a fee to Ge-\n2 \nffen. In 2025, the secondary-application fee is $100. For previous application cycles, \n3 \nthe secondary-application fee was $95.  \n4 \n5  44.  After the secondary review, select students get an opportunity to inter-\n6 \nview with faculty members. The interviews are conducted either in person or remotely \n7 \nby video.  \n8 \n45.  After the interviews, the Admissions Committee deliberates on the appli-\n9 \n10 \ncations together.  \n11 \n46.  After the committee deliberates, it ranks the applicants and makes final \n12 \nadmission decisions on who to admit.  \n13 \n14  47.  At each step of the process—primary review, secondary review, inter-\n15 \nview, and committee deliberation—the Admissions Committee purports to review \n16 \neach application holistically. Harvard, UNC, and virtually all other elite universities that \n17 \n18  openly considered race in admissions before Harvard likewise use holistic admissions. \n19 \nCf. 600 U.S. at 257 (Thomas, J., concurring) (“Harvard’s ‘holistic’ admissions policy \n20 \nbegan in the 1920s when it was developed to exclude Jews.”). Notwithstanding Har-\n21 \n22  vard, AAMC has encouraged medical schools like UCLA to continue using holistic \n23 \nreview to “boost racial diversity.”  \n24 \nII.  UCLA Medical School uses race as a factor in admissions. \n25 \n48.  In defiance of state and federal law, UCLA uses race as a factor in admis-\n26 \nsions. Both the UC System and Geffen have publicly expressed their intent to racially \n27 \n28 \n  12 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 13 of 38   Page ID #:13\n \n1  balance the class. Geffen’s dean of admissions, Lucero, both publicly and privately said \n2 \nshe uses race as a factor in making admission decisions. And whistleblowers confirm \n3 \nthat the admissions committee, either led or intimidated by Lucero, use all available \n4 \n5  methods to glean an applicant’s race, openly discuss applicants’ race, and use race to \n6 \nhold students to different standards based on race.   \n7 \n49.  In Harvard, the UC System submitted an amicus brief stating that it “im-\n8 \nplemented numerous and wideranging race-neutral measures designed to increase … \n9 \n10 \nracial diversity.” The UC System also said although “Proposition 209 barred consider-\n11 \nation of race in admissions decisions at public universities in California,” its competitor \n12 \nuniversities outside of California “must retain the ability to engage in the … consider-\n13 \n14  ation of race” under Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003). That would have made it \n15 \nmore difficult for the UC System to attract minority students. Indeed, this position \n16 \nmakes no sense unless the UC System was still using race and needed that practice to \n17 \n18  be lawful under federal law.  \n19 \n50.  Similarly, in 2024, the UC System said that “system- and campus-level \n20 \nstrategies and innovations are being piloted or have been implemented” to “achieve \n21 \n22  representational diversity in its student body.”  \n23 \n51.  The UC System further adopted the “UC 2030 Capacity Plan,” with the \n24 \ngoal of having its student bodies “better reflec[t] California’s racial/ethnic … diver-\n25 \n26  sity.” Drake, the UC System President, wanted “intentional” “growth” in terms of \n27 \nmaking “graduate students … better reflect and tap the talent of underrepresented \n28 \n  13 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 14 of 38   Page ID #:14\n \n1  populations who represent the majority of Californians.” To support this goal of \n2 \n“mov[ing] the needle on the diversity of graduate students,” the Regents “requested \n3 \ngraduate professional programs” to “present race/ethnicity data on students and fac-\n4 \n5  ulty, along with diversity plans within the program.”  \n6 \n52.  The UC System meticulously measures its racial outcomes in a variety of \n7 \nways, including by closely tracking the racial demographics of its students.  \n8 \n53.  In 2020, Geffen adopted the “Anti-Racism Roadmap” with the purpose \n9 \n10 \nof creating a “path toward racial justice, equity, diversity and inclusion.”  \n11 \n54.  Under the roadmap, Geffen instituted sweeping policies concerning race \n12 \nin its operations.  \n13 \n14  a.  Geffen re-defined “merit” to include “diversity and inclusion initiatives.”  \n15 \nb.  Geffen  committed  itself  to  increasing  BIPOC  employees  and  chairs \n16 \namong its faculty and created a special pathway for BIPOC postdoctoral \n17 \n18  trainees, fellows, and residents to become faculty.  \n19 \nc.  Geffen committed itself to creating special opportunities for BIPOC re-\n20 \nsearchers to present seminars, present research, and otherwise participate \n21 \n22  in research opportunities, including by providing “minority supplements” \n23 \nto NIH grants.  \n24 \nd.  Geffen vowed that the medical-student body “should reflect the popula-\n25 \n26  tion of State of California” and adopted a strategic plan to “increase the \n27 \nnumber  of  URiM  students.”  The  term  “URiM”  stands  for \n28 \n  14 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 15 of 38   Page ID #:15\n \n1  underrepresented in medicine. Its proponents consider all lacks to be un-\n2 \nderrepresented and all whites and Asians to be overrepresented.  \n3 \ne.  Geffen vowed collaboration among the Admissions Committee, the Ad-\n4 \n5  missions Policy Oversight Committee, and Faculty Executive Committee \n6 \nto “review and improve diversity to reflect the population of the State of \n7 \nCalifornia.”  \n8 \nf.  Geffen sought the participation of “diverse” medical students and its Eq-\n9 \n10 \nuity, Diversity, and Inclusion Office in the admissions process to further \n11 \nits racial goals.  \n12 \ng.  Geffen also explained how it would monitor the racial numbers in the \n13 \n14  admissions process. It explained that it would engage in “strategic plan-\n15 \nning to improve diversity for all UCLA Health professional students using \n16 \ndata-driven, evidence-based approaches.” In addition, it would “collect \n17 \n18  and publicly report data on diversity in all school programs.”  \n19 \n55.  Geffen’s Anti-Racism Roadmap has separately been incorporated into \n20 \nthe school’s diversity statements, which the Admissions Committee applies in review-\n21 \n22  ing each application.  \n23 \n56.  In 2020, Geffen named Lucero its Dean of Admissions. Lucero is also \n24 \nthe Vice Chair of DEI efforts at UCLA Health, the hospital system affiliated with \n25 \n26  Geffen.   \n27 \n28 \n  15 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 16 of 38   Page ID #:16\n \n1  57.  Lucero is an outspoken advocate for using race as a factor in admissions \n2 \nand hiring in medical school and healthcare. Lucero has stated her view that every part \n3 \nof society—including academic medicine—is structurally racist. Lucero has stated her \n4 \n5  view that racism affects admission decisions and impedes DEI efforts. Lucero has also \n6 \nstated her view that comments like “We want diversity, but we also want qualified \n7 \npeople” are biased and racist.  \n8 \n58.  Lucero has stated in articles and public interviews that it’s important to \n9 \n10 \nracially diversify medical-school admissions, residencies, and leadership positions in \n11 \nmedicine. As Dean of Admissions, Lucero has significant influence over the appoint-\n12 \nment of Admissions Committee members. Lucero has remade the Admissions Com-\n13 \n14  mittee to be, what she calls, a “brave space” that both looks racially diverse and is \n15 \nwhere the committee members feel free to further DEI efforts.  \n16 \n59.  Consistent with Lucero’s beliefs, Geffen’s current “Guiding Principles \n17 \n18  for Student Representation” state that the chair of the Admission Committee will en-\n19 \nsure that medical students who identify as BIPOC are placed on the committee to \n20 \nprovide their input on admissions.  \n21 \n22  60.  Given the UC System’s and Geffen’s explicit desire to racially balance the \n23 \nstudent body, and with Lucero at the helm, the Admissions Committee makes admis-\n24 \nsion decisions by using race as a factor.  \n25 \n26  61.  Lucero and her handpicked Admissions Committee take advantage of \n27 \nUCLA’s holistic-review procedure to uncover and then use applicants’ race.  \n28 \n  16 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 17 of 38   Page ID #:17\n \n1  62.  Lucero and the Admissions Committee routinely admit black applicants \n2 \nwith  below-average  GPA  and  MCAT  scores—even  significantly  below-average \n3 \nscores—while requiring whites and Asians to have near-perfect scores to even be seri-\n4 \n5  ously considered.  \n6 \n63.  Lucero and the Admissions Committee explicitly discuss and use appli-\n7 \ncants’ race. On one occasion when the Committee was deliberating on a black appli-\n8 \ncant with a significantly below-average GPA and MCAT score, Lucero stated: “Did \n9 \n10 \nyou not know African-American women are dying at a higher rate than everyone else?” \n11 \n“We need people like this in the medical school.”  \n12 \n64.  Committee members report that the bar for underrepresented minorities \n13 \n14  is “as low as you could possibly imagine” and that the Committee “completely disre-\n15 \ngards grades and achievements” for those applicants.  \n16 \n65.  Lucero regularly bullies and berates members of the Admissions Com-\n17 \n18  mittee who voice concerns about admitting below-average black applicants by labeling \n19 \nthem as “privileged” and implying that they are racist.  \n20 \n66.  Another time when the Committee rejected a Native American applicant, \n21 \n22  Lucero berated the Committee and made the members sit through a two-hour lecture \n23 \non Native American history taught by Lucero’s sister.  \n24 \n67.  Lucero and the Admissions Committee regularly glean the applicants’ \n25 \n26  race through direct and indirect means. The secondary application even asks questions \n27 \n28 \n  17 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 18 of 38   Page ID #:18\n \n1  designed to uncover applicants’ race. The interviews further enable the committee to \n2 \nknow applicants’ race and ethnicity.  \n3 \n68.  Statistical evidence obtained through public-records requests confirm \n4 \n5  that Lucero and the Admissions Committee are using race.  \n6 \n69.  Despite consistently making up a large percentage of the total applicant \n7 \npool, the percentage of white and Asian students who matriculate at UCLA Medical \n8 \nSchool has dropped precipitously since Lucero took over as dean. \n9 \n10 \n70.  In 2020, white applicants constituted 36.71% of the total applicant pool. \n11 \nYet only 30.29% of the matriculants were white.  \n12 \n71.  In 2021, white applicants constituted 35.02% of the total applicant pool. \n13 \n14  Yet only 27.43% of the matriculants were white.  \n15 \n72.  In 2022 white applicants constituted 34.64% of the total applicant pool. \n16 \nYet only 26.59% of the matriculants were white.  \n17 \n18  73.  In 2023, white applicants constituted 32.83% of the total applicant pool. \n19 \nYet only 24% of the matriculants were white.  \n20 \n74.  In 2020, Asian applicants constituted 37.83% of the total applicant pool. \n21 \n22  Yet only 35.43% of the matriculants were Asian.  \n23 \n75.  In 2021, Asian applicants constituted 37.13% of the total applicant pool. \n24 \nYet only 29.71% of the matriculants were Asian.  \n25 \n26  76.  In 2022, Asian applicants constituted 39.34% of the total applicant pool. \n27 \nYet only 31.21% of the matriculants were Asian.  \n28 \n  18 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 19 of 38   Page ID #:19\n \n1  77.  In 2023, Asian applicants constituted 40.79% of the total applicant pool. \n2 \nYet only 29.71% of the matriculants were Asian.  \n3 \n78.  A disproportionately higher number of black applicants matriculated to \n4 \n5  Geffen in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. \n6 \n79.  In 2020, black applicants made up 7.06% of the applicant pool. Yet 8% \n7 \nof the matriculants were black.  \n8 \n80.  In 2021, black applicants made up 8.93% of the applicant pool. Yet \n9 \n10 \n11.43% of the matriculants were black.  \n11 \n81.  In 2022, black applicants made up 7.64% of the applicant pool. Yet \n12 \n9.83% of the matriculants were black.  \n13 \n14  82.  In 2023, black applicants made up 7.86% of the applicant pool. Yet \n15 \n14.29% of the matriculants were black.  \n16 \n83.  Geffen’s matriculants have an average GPA of 3.8 and average MCAT \n17 \n18  of 514. Nationally, the average GPA for white matriculants was a 3.8 and the average \n19 \nMCAT was 512.4, while Asian matriculants had an average GPA of 3.83 in and an \n20 \naverage MCAT of 514.3. Yet black matriculants had an average GPA of 3.59 and an \n21 \n22  average MCAT of 505.7.  \n23 \n84.  Geffen closely guards the GPA and MCAT scores for its matriculants. \n24 \nAnd it does not make the GPAs or MCAT scores of matriculants available to the pub-\n25 \n26  lic. Geffen has stubbornly refused to produce full MCAT scores, even in response to \n27 \na public-records request. For years, Geffen’s administration even refused to provide \n28 \n  19 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 20 of 38   Page ID #:20\n \n1  admissions data to the faculty oversight board. UCLA’s refusal to turn over this infor-\n2 \nmation confirms that the data would show large racial preferences. \n3 \n85.  Lucero’s and the Admissions Committee’s illegal use of race in admis-\n4 \n5  sions was known, and caused grave concern, among Geffen’s faculty members.  \n6 \n86.  After receiving multiple complaints for years, UCLA’s internal Discrimi-\n7 \nnation Prevention Office, charged with ensuring compliance with Title VI and other \n8 \nlaws, sought to investigate Lucero and Geffen’s admissions practices.  \n9 \n10 \n87.  Four members of the Admissions Committee initially agreed to partici-\n11 \npate in that investigation. But the Admissions Committee had required its members to \n12 \nsign a nondisclosure agreement barring any discussion of the committee’s delibera-\n13 \n14  tions. When these four members wrote to Geffen’s administration (including Dubi-\n15 \nnett) seeking written assurance that they would not be retaliated against for cooperating \n16 \nwith the internal probe, the administration refused to give them that assurance. Ge-\n17 \n18  ffen’s administration thus effectively shut down UCLA’s internal probe.  \n19 \n88.  Geffen’s use of race in admissions has now prompted HHS to open an \n20 \ninvestigation.  \n21 \n22  III.  UCLA’s racial discrimination has harmed and continues to harm \nPlaintiffs. \n23 \n24  89.  Do No Harm has at least one member who is ready and able to apply to \n25 \nGeffen, including DNH-Member A. \n26 \n90.  DNH-Member A is white, a U.S. citizen, and a recent college graduate. \n27 \n28 \n  20 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 21 of 38   Page ID #:21\n \n1  91.  DNH-Member A applied to Geffen in 2024.  \n2 \n92.  DNH-Member A had a 3.88 cumulative college GPA and scored 526 on \n3 \nthe MCAT, which was in the 100th percentile. He completed all necessary courses. \n4 \n5  93.  DNH-Member A submitted both the primary and secondary applications \n6 \nto Geffen. DNH-Member A paid the primary-application fee and the secondary-ap-\n7 \nplication fee. DNH-Member A also incurred the cost of taking the PREview Exam.  \n8 \n94.  Despite his stellar academic achievements, DNH-Member A was rejected \n9 \n10 \nby Geffen.  \n11 \n95.  If a court were to order Defendants to stop discriminating and issue an \n12 \ninjunction undoing the effects of their prior discrimination, DNH-Member A is able \n13 \n14  and ready to reapply to Geffen, including by applying to transfer.  \n15 \n96.  SFFA has at least one member who will apply to Geffen. \n16 \n97.  SFFA-Member 1 is female, half-Asian and half-white, a U.S. citizen who \n17 \n18  graduated from a high school in California, and a current college student. She will sat-\n19 \nisfy all requirements to attend medical school. \n20 \n98.  SFFA-Member 1 has a GPA of 3.4. Her science grades are near the 90th \n21 \n22  percentile of her class this semester. SFFA-Member 1 has worked as a health aide at a \n23 \nresident-care home and has managed multiple businesses even at a young age. SFFA-\n24 \nMember 1 will prepare for and take the MCAT.  \n25 \n26  99.  SFFA-Member 1 wants to attend Geffen, will apply, and will take all nec-\n27 \nessary steps to apply.  \n28 \n  21 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 22 of 38   Page ID #:22\n \n1  100.  Because of Geffen’s racially discriminatory admissions policies and prac-\n2 \ntices, without a court order fully preventing Defendants from discriminating, SFFA-\n3 \nMember 1 will not be able to compete for admissions on an equal footing.  \n4 \n5  101.  Plaintiff Mahoney has been harmed by Defendants’ illegal use of race in \n6 \nadmissions.  \n7 \n102.  Mahoney is female and a U.S. citizen.  \n8 \n103.  Mahoney started at a community college and later transferred to UC Da-\n9 \n10 \nvis, graduating with a GPA around 3.8.  \n11 \n104.  Mahoney scored 519 on MCAT (96th percentile), well above Geffen’s \n12 \naverage.  \n13 \n14  105.  To follow in the footsteps of her father, who is a doctor and who taught \n15 \nher about the responsibility of doctors to guide patients through the most vulnerable \n16 \nperiods in their lives, Mahoney decided to apply to medical school. She spent her col-\n17 \n18  lege years taking difficult science classes and preparing for the MCAT. After graduat-\n19 \ning, she gained research, clinical, and volunteer experiences. With her stellar creden-\n20 \ntials, Mahoney applied to various medical schools multiple times, including Geffen.  \n21 \n22  106.  In 2023, for example, Mahoney applied to Geffen and was invited to sub-\n23 \nmit a secondary application. When she applied, Mahoney paid the primary-application \n24 \nfee and the secondary-application fee. Mahoney also incurred the cost of taking the \n25 \n26  PREview Exam.  \n27 \n28 \n  22 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 23 of 38   Page ID #:23\n \n1  107.  But Mahoney was rejected without an interview. Geffen sent a rejection \n2 \nletter to Mahoney on February 6, 2024. \n3 \n108.  Mahoney is white. Though she has some Hispanic background, UCLA \n4 \n5  did not know that fact when she applied in 2023. \n6 \n109.  If she were black, Mahoney would have had a far better chance of getting \n7 \nadmitted to UCLA. Mahoney finds it hurtful and offensive that UCLA would judge \n8 \nher based on irrelevant racial factors that she cannot control. \n9 \n10 \n110.  Mahoney is able and ready to apply to Geffen again if a court orders \n11 \nDefendants to stop discriminating and to undo the effects of their prior discrimination.  \n12 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13 \n111.  Per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, Mahoney brings this action indi-\n14 \n15  vidually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated.  \n16 \n112.  Mahoney proposes the following class definition and seek class certifica-\n17 \ntion, subject to amendment based on information obtained through discovery:  \n18 \nClass: All individuals who applied to Geffen within the statute of limita-\n19 \ntions, do not identify as black, paid an application-related fee, and were \n20 \ndenied admission.   \n21 \nInjunctive Subclass: All individuals who are able and ready to ap-\n22  ply or reapply to Geffen if the Court order relief that fully stops the \nschool from considering race in admissions and undoes the effect \n23 \nof the school’s prior discrimination, including by enjoining the \n24  school’s limitations on transfers and multiple applications.  \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  23 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 24 of 38   Page ID #:24\n \n1  113.  Mahoney reserves the right to amend the definition of the class or to add \n2 \na class or subclass if further information and discovery indicate that the definition of \n3 \nthe class should be narrowed, expanded, or otherwise modified.  \n4 \n5  114.  Specifically excluded from this Class are Defendants’ officers, directors, \n6 \nemployees, and agents; any entity in which a Defendant has a controlling interest; and \n7 \naffiliates, legal representatives, attorneys, successors, heirs, or assigns of Defendant. \n8 \nAlso excluded from this Class are any judicial officers to whom this case is assigned, \n9 \n10 \ntheir families, and members of their staff. \n11 \n115.  Class certification is appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12 \n23(a).  \n13 \n14  116.  Numerosity: The class is “so numerous that joinder of all members is \n15 \nimpracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); see Powers v. McDonough, 732 F. Supp. 3d 1184, \n16 \n1192 (C.D. Cal. 2024) (“courts generally find that numerosity obtains when a class has \n17 \n18  forty or more members.”). The members of the class and the subclasses are so numer-\n19 \nous that joinder of all of them is impracticable. Each year, UCLA Medical School re-\n20 \nceives between 11,000 and 14,000 applications; and the nonblack applicants make up \n21 \n22  the vast majority. Class members can be notified of the pendency of this action by \n23 \nrecognized, court-approved notice dissemination methods, which may include U.S. \n24 \nmail, email, internet postings, or other published notice.  \n25 \n26  117.  Commonality: There are “questions of law or fact common to the \n27 \nclass.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). “A common question ‘must be of such nature that it is \n28 \n  24 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 25 of 38   Page ID #:25\n \n1  capable of class wide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity \n2 \nwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one \n3 \nstroke.’” Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 663 \n4 \n5  (9th Cir. 2022). Claims challenging a “government policy” that “results in the system-\n6 \natic discrimination against class members” subjects class members to a “common in-\n7 \njury” of “systematic discrimination.” Powers, 732 F. Supp. 3d at 1193; see also Little v. \n8 \nWash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 249 F. Supp. 3d 394, 419 (D.D.C. 2017) (challenging a \n9 \n10 \n“single” discriminatory policy “that was applied to all members of the class” satisfied \n11 \ncommonality). Here, the members of the class and subclass raise the “core claim” that \n12 \napplicants “were subjected to different standards and criteria for admission” because \n13 \n14  of “their race or ethnicity.” Smith v. Univ. of Wash. Law Sch., 2 F. Supp. 2d 1324, 1342 \n15 \n(W.D. Wash. 1998). Whether Defendants “intentionally discriminated … on the basis \n16 \nof race”—and thus denied the class members “equal treatment under the law”—is \n17 \n18  “common to the putative classes.” Id. Specifically, this case presents questions of law \n19 \nand fact that are common to the class and subclass, including but not limited to the \n20 \nfollowing: (1) whether Defendants use race as a factor in making admission decisions; \n21 \n22  (2) whether Defendants’ use of race in making admission decisions violates the Con-\n23 \nstitution, Title VI, and §1981; and (3) whether Plaintiff Mahoney and members of the \n24 \nclass and subclass are entitled to relief.  \n25 \n26  118.  Typicality: The “claims or defenses of the representative parties are typ-\n27 \nical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). This element asks \n28 \n  25 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 26 of 38   Page ID #:26\n \n1  “‘whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based \n2 \non conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class mem-\n3 \nbers have been injured by the same course of conduct.’” Powers, 732 F. Supp. 3d at \n4 \n5  1195. Mahoney’s claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class and subclass \n6 \nbecause her claims are based upon the same legal theories and violations of the law. \n7 \nMahoney and the class members all suffered the same injury because of Defendants’ \n8 \nintentional discrimination in Geffen’s admissions process. See Smith, 2 F. Supp. 2d at \n9 \n10 \n1342-43.  \n11 \n119.  Adequacy: The representative parties “will fairly and adequately protect \n12 \nthe interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). Mahoney will fairly and adequately \n13 \n14  represent and protect the interests of the members the class and subclass. Mahoney’s \n15 \ninterests are coincident with, and not antagonistic to, those of the members of the class \n16 \nand subclass. She opposes all preferences based on race or ethnicity, of any kind and \n17 \n18  to any degree. Mahoney’s lawyers are competent and experienced in litigating civil-\n19 \nrights cases and mass actions.  \n20 \n120.  Class certification is appropriate also because this case fits into all three \n21 \n22  categories listed in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b). Class certification requires \n23 \nsatisfying only one. Olean, 31 F.4th at 663.  \n24 \n121.  Superiority: Under Rule 23(b)(1), a class action is a superior method for \n25 \n26  the fair and efficient adjudication of this case because class proceedings are superior \n27 \nto all other available methods for fair and efficient adjudication of this case, and joinder \n28 \n  26 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 27 of 38   Page ID #:27\n \n1  of the class (and subclass) members is otherwise impracticable. Class treatment pre-\n2 \nsents a superior mechanism for fairly resolving similar issues and claims without repe-\n3 \ntitious and wasteful litigation. It would impose a substantial hardship for most individ-\n4 \n5  ual members of the class or subclass to prosecute individual actions, many of whom \n6 \nare not able to incur the expense of retaining their own counsel to prosecute individual \n7 \nactions. The litigation of individual cases would also create inconsistent results, with \n8 \nsome members of the class recovering but not others, and some courts declaring De-\n9 \n10 \nfendants liable for discrimination but potentially not others, establishing incompatible \n11 \nstandards of conduct for Defendants. By contrast, if this Court adjudicates Defend-\n12 \nants’ liability for all class members, it can resolve their claims all at once, without in-\n13 \n14  consistent results, thus obtaining global relief and judicial efficiency.  \n15 \n122.  Injunctive  or  Declaratory  Relief:  Injunctive  and  declaratory  relief \n16 \n“with respect to the class as a whole” is appropriate. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Because \n17 \n18  Defendants discriminated against white and Asian applicants “by applying different \n19 \nstandards and criteria for admission,” this is a “paradigm case for certification under \n20 \nRule 23(b)(2).” Smith, 2 F. Supp. 2d at 1343.  \n21 \n22  123.  Predominance: Under Rule 23(b)(3), Defendants engaged in a common \n23 \ncourse of discriminatory conduct toward Mahoney and class members. Mahoney and \n24 \nclass members were denied equal treatment in the admissions process because of their \n25 \n26  race. The common issues arising from Defendants’ discriminatory conduct toward the \n27 \n28 \n  27 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 28 of 38   Page ID #:28\n \n1  class members predominate over any individualized issues, especially given the me-\n2 \nchanical nature of the requested damages.  \n3 \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n4 \nCOUNT I \n5 \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n6  (U.S. Const. amend. XIV; 42 U.S.C. §1983) \n7  124.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the preceding allegations.  \n8 \n125.  Section 1983 provides that “[e]very person who, under color of any stat-\n9 \nute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District \n10 \n11  of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or \n12 \nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, \n13 \nor immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured \n14 \n15  in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.” 42 U.S.C. \n16 \n§1983. \n17 \n126.  All individual Defendants are “person[s]” acting under the color of state \n18 \n19  law. §1983.  \n20 \n127.  The Fourteenth Amendment provides, among other things, that no per-\n21 \nson shall be denied “the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, §1. \n22 \n128.  The “central mandate” of equal protection is “racial neutrality” by the \n23 \n24 \ngovernment. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 904 (1995). And the “‘core purpose’ of the \n25 \nEqual Protection Clause” is to “‘d[o] away with all governmentally imposed discrimi-\n26 \nnation based on race.’” Harvard, 600 U.S. at 206 (emphasis added). “[W]henever the \n27 \n28 \n  28 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 29 of 38   Page ID #:29\n \n1  government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has \n2 \nsuffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution’s \n3 \nguarantee of equal protection.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 229-30 \n4 \n5  (2000). \n6 \n129.  Defendants through UCLA Medical School intentionally engage in “‘out-\n7 \nright racial balancing,’” which is “‘patently unconstitutional.’” Harvard, 600 U.S. at 223. \n8 \nThe Supreme Court has repeated that “‘[r]acial balance is not to be achieved for its \n9 \n10 \nown sake.’” Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 729-30 \n11 \n(2007) (plurality). Despite this admonition, Defendants adopted admissions policies \n12 \nand practices that ensure that Geffen’s medical-student population reflect the racial \n13 \n14  composition of the State. Geffen’s racial-balancing project is confirmed by statistical \n15 \nevidence. Between 2020 and 2023, the percentage of white and Asian matriculants \n16 \nplummeted precipitously despite constituting a much larger share of the total applicant \n17 \n18  pool. At the same time, the percentage of black matriculants jumped significantly, de-\n19 \nspite constituting a much smaller portion of the total applicant pool.  \n20 \n130.  The Admissions Committee also uses a sophisticated “holistic” applica-\n21 \n22  tion-review method that’s designed to glean and use applicants’ race. The secondary \n23 \napplications ask questions designed to facilitate the Committee’s use of race. And the \n24 \nin-person or virtual interview process facilitates the Committee’s use of race. The Ad-\n25 \n26  missions Committee also explicitly discusses race and uses it as a factor in making \n27 \nadmission decisions.  \n28 \n  29 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 30 of 38   Page ID #:30\n \n1  131.  Especially for black students, their race results in a significant boost in \n2 \nthe admissions process, sufficient to overcome a significant below-average GPA or \n3 \nMCAT score.  \n4 \n5  132.  This use of race is patently illegal. “‘[N]o State has any authority under \n6 \nthe equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a factor in \n7 \naffording educational opportunities.’” Harvard, 600 U.S. at 204.  \n8 \n133.  At the very least, the Admissions Committee uses proxies for race in \n9 \n10 \nmaking admission decisions. This is also illegal. “What cannot be done directly cannot \n11 \nbe done indirectly.” Id. at 230. And “universities may not simply stablish through ap-\n12 \nplication essays or other means the regime” that is “unlawful.” Id. Discrimination on \n13 \n14  the basis of perceived race, even if mistaken, is also equally actionable. See, e.g., Estate \n15 \nof Amos ex rel. Amos v. City of Page, 257 F.3d 1086, 1094 (9th Cir. 2001); Santos v. Peralta \n16 \nCmty. Coll. Dist., 2009 WL 38098797, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 13). \n17 \n18  134.  When the government “distributes … benefits on the basis of individual \n19 \nracial classifications, that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny.” Parents Involved, 551 \n20 \nU.S. at 720 (majority).   \n21 \n22  135.  Strict scrutiny is a “searching examination, and it is the government that \n23 \nbears the burden to prove ‘that the reasons for any racial classification are clearly iden-\n24 \ntified and unquestionably legitimate.’” Fisher v. Univ. of Tex., 570 U.S. 297, 310 (2013) \n25 \n26  (cleaned up). The racial classification “must survive a daunting two-step examination.” \n27 \nHarvard, 600 U.S. at 206. First, the racial classification must “‘further compelling \n28 \n  30 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 31 of 38   Page ID #:31\n \n1  governmental interests.’” Id. at 207. Second, the government’s use of race must be \n2 \n“‘narrowly tailored’—meaning ‘necessary’—to achieve that interest.” Id. \n3 \n136.  Defendants cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.  \n4 \n5  137.  Defendants cannot show a compelling governmental interest. The Su-\n6 \npreme Court has recognized compelling interests in the use of race in only the narrow-\n7 \nest of circumstances, where those preferences are explicitly designed to remedy recent \n8 \nacts of discrimination and to make the individual subjects of that discrimination whole. \n9 \n10 \nId. There is no evidence that Defendants adopted their current admissions policies and \n11 \npractices to remedy some past discrimination that they took part in. Instead, Defend-\n12 \nants are engaged in simple racial balancing, which is plainly illegitimate. Worse, De-\n13 \n14  fendants want to accept more underrepresented applicants simply because they belong \n15 \nto underrepresented minority groups. Such an outright race-based distribution of gov-\n16 \nernmental benefits and resources—especially in the educational context—is illegal. See \n17 \n18  Brown, 347 U.S. at 493-94; Harvard, 600 U.S. at 216-18.  \n19 \n138.  Defendants’ admissions policies and practices are also not narrowly tai-\n20 \nlored.  \n21 \n22  139.  Race operates as a “negative” by disadvantaging nonblack applicants in \n23 \nthe admissions process. Admission to Geffen is a highly selective, zero-sum process. \n24 \nAny benefit given to “some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the \n25 \n26  former group at the expense of the latter.” Harvard, 600 U.S. at 219.  \n27 \n28 \n  31 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 32 of 38   Page ID #:32\n \n1  140.  Defendants use race as a stereotype—for example, by proceeding from \n2 \nthe unfounded assumption that “there is an inherent benefit in race qua race.” Id. at \n3 \n220.  \n4 \n5  141.  Defendants’ use of race has no end date.  \n6 \n142.  Section 1983 authorizes damages and injunctive relief. It also authorizes \n7 \npunitive damages “‘when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil \n8 \nmotive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally \n9 \n10 \nprotected rights of others.’” Bacon v. Woodward, 104 F.4th 744, 750 (9th Cir. 2024). \n11 \nDefendants’ direct and indirect use of race in making admission decisions—especially \n12 \nafter Prop 209 and Harvard—shows callous disregard of applicants’ right to equal treat-\n13 \n14  ment.  \n15 \nCOUNT II \n16 \nViolation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n17  (42 U.S.C. §2000d et seq.) \n18  143.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the preceding allegations. \n19 \n144.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that no person “shall, \n20 \non the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be \n21 \n22  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \n23 \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. §2000d. \n24 \n145.  Defendants UCLA Medical School, UCLA, and the Regents are covered \n25 \n26  by Title VI. Title VI defines “program or activity” to mean “all of the operations of” \n27 \na “university” or “public system of higher education” “any part of which is extended \n28 \n  32 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 33 of 38   Page ID #:33\n \n1  Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. §2000d-4a(2)(A). The UC System, UCLA, and \n2 \nUCLA Medical School receive federal funds in federal student aid and research grants.   \n3 \n146.  Under 42 U.S.C. §2000d-7(a)(1), a state is “not … immune … from suit \n4 \n5  in Federal court for a violation of … title VI.”  \n6 \n147.  Private individuals can sue to enforce Title VI and obtain both injunctive \n7 \nrelief and compensatory damages. See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 279-80 \n8 \n(2001). \n9 \n10 \n148.  Defendants have caused and will continue to cause applicants to be “ex-\n11 \ncluded from participation in,” “denied the benefits of,” and “subjected to discrimina-\n12 \ntion under” UCLA’s admissions policies and practices “on the ground of race, color, \n13 \n14  or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. §2000d. \n15 \n149.  Title VI has “‘independent force’” and makes it “always unlawful to dis-\n16 \ncriminate among persons even in part because of race” without subjecting racial clas-\n17 \n18  sifications to strict scrutiny. Harvard, 600 U.S. at 308-09 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).   \n19 \n150.  At a minimum, because Defendants violate the Fourteenth Amendment, \n20 \nthey also violate Title VI. See SFFA v. Harvard, 980 F.3d 157, 185 (1st Cir. 2020) (“Title \n21 \n22  VI’s protections are coextensive with the Equal Protection Clause.”), rev’d on other ground \n23 \n600 U.S. 181. \n24 \nCOUNT III \n25 \nViolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 \n26  (42 U.S.C. §1981) \n27 \n151.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the preceding allegations. \n28 \n  33 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 34 of 38   Page ID #:34\n \n1  152.  Section 1981 guarantees “[a]ll persons … the same right … to make and \n2 \nenforce contracts … as is enjoyed by white citizens.” 42 U.S.C. §1981(a). And it author-\n3 \nizes equitable and legal relief, including compensatory and punitive damages. Johnson v. \n4 \n5  Ry. Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 459-60 (1975).  \n6 \n153.  White and Asian applicants are protected by §1981, whose “broad terms” \n7 \nbar discrimination “against, or in favor of, any race.” McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. \n8 \nCo., 427 U.S. 273, 295 (1976). Titled “Equal rights under the law,” §1981 “guarantee[s] \n9 \n10 \ncontinuous equality between white and nonwhite citizens,” Jam v. Int’l Fin. Corp., 586 \n11 \nU.S. 199, 208 (2019), by protecting the “equal right of all persons … to make and en-\n12 \nforce contracts without respect to race,” Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, \n13 \n14  474 (2006) (cleaned up). Section 1981 “forbids racial discrimination … whether the \n15 \naggrieved party is black or white.” Bobo v. ITT, Cont’l Baking Co., 662 F.2d 340, 342 (5th \n16 \nCir. 1981). \n17 \n18  154.  “[A] contract for educational services is a ‘contract’ for purposes of \n19 \n§1981.” Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 276 n.23 (2003). \n20 \n155.  The admissions process at Geffen implicates the right to “make … con-\n21 \n22  tracts.” §1981(a). Section 1981 “protects ‘would-be contractor[s]’ … to the same extent \n23 \nthat it protects contracting parties.” AAER v. Fearless Fund Mgmt., LLC, 103 F.4th 765, \n24 \n776 (11th Cir. 2024). The statute broadly “offers relief when racial discrimination blocks \n25 \n26  the creation of a contractual relationship.” Domino’s, 546 U.S. at 476.  \n27 \n28 \n  34 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 35 of 38   Page ID #:35\n \n1  156.  Defendants are violating §1981 by intentionally limiting the formation of \n2 \ncontractual relationships based on race. \n3 \n157.  Race is a but-for cause of applicants’ “‘loss of a legally protected right’” to \n4 \n5  make contracts. Newman v. Amazon.com, Inc., 2022 WL 971297, at *7 (D.D.C. Mar. 31). \n6 \n“So long as the plaintiff’s [race] was one but-for cause of that decision, that is enough.” \n7 \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020). But for the fact that the applicants \n8 \nare a disfavored race, they would have had the “same right” to “make … contracts” \n9 \n10 \nwith UCLA. §1981(a). \n11 \n158.  At a minimum, because Defendants violate the Fourteenth Amendment, \n12 \nthey also violate §1981. Gratz, 539 U.S. at 276 n.23. \n13 \n14 \nCOUNT IV \n15  Violation of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act \n(Cal. Civ. Code §51 et seq.) \n16 \n159.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the preceding allegations.  \n17 \n18  160.  California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act provides that “[a]ll persons within the \n19 \njurisdiction of this state are free and equal” and that “no matter what their” “race,” \n20 \n“color,” “ancestry,” or “national origin,” they are “entitled to the full and equal accom-\n21 \n22  modations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of \n23 \nevery kind whatsoever.” Cal. Civ. Code §51(b). The Unruh Act “prohibits arbitrary dis-\n24 \ncrimination, both benign and improperly intentioned, against minorities or majorities.” \n25 \n26  Park Redlands Covenant Control Comm. v. Simon, 226 Cal. Rptr. 199, 202 (Cal. Ct. App. \n27 \n1986).  \n28 \n  35 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 36 of 38   Page ID #:36\n \n1  161.  “Whoever denies, aids or incites a denial, or makes any discrimination or \n2 \ndistinction … is liable for each and every offense for the actual damages, and any \n3 \namount … up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damages but in no \n4 \n5  case less than four thousand dollars.” Cal. Civ. Code §52(a). “The litigant need not \n6 \nprove she suffered actual damages to recover the independent statutory damages of \n7 \n$4,000.” Molski v. M.J. Cables, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 731 (9th Cir. 2007). The Unruh Act \n8 \nalso authorizes attorney’s fees.  \n9 \n10 \n162.  Defendants  Frenk,  Dubinett,  Lucero,  Kuo,  Buhr,  Celedon,  Holland, \n11 \nHouser, Myo, Saab, and Members of the Admissions Committee can be sued under \n12 \nthe Unruh Act in their personal capacities. See, e.g., Fruciano v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., \n13 \n14  2018 WL 4219232, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 5); K.S. v. Fremont United Sch. Dist., 2007 WL \n15 \n4287522, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 6).  \n16 \n163.  Geffen, especially as it relates to its admissions practices, is a “business \n17 \n18  establishmen[t] of every kind whatsoever” under the Unruh Act, Cal. Civ. Code §51(b), \n19 \nbecause it “‘resemble[s] an ordinary for-profit business,’” “‘effectively operate[s] as a \n20 \nbusiness or a commercial enterprise,’” and “‘involve[s] sufficient businesslike attrib-\n21 \n22  utes,’” Kohn v. State Bar of Calif., 2024 WL 4533446, at *2 (9th Cir. Oct. 21). Geffen \n23 \nadvertises itself as a top medical school in the country to attract competitive applicants \n24 \nand to enhance its economic value. Geffen collects application fees from applicants \n25 \n26  nationwide. And it enters into contractual relationships. It also solicits and operates \n27 \nwith private endowments and other non-state funds.  \n28 \n  36 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 37 of 38   Page ID #:37\n \n1  164.  Geffen engaged in intentional racial discrimination in violation of Unruh \n2 \nby disfavoring certain applicants because of their race.  \n3 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n4 \n  Plaintiffs ask this Court to enter judgment in its favor and against Defendants \n5 \n6  and to provide the following relief: \n7 \nA.  A declaratory judgment that Defendants’ admissions policies and prac-\n8  tices violate the Constitution, Title VI, §1981, and the Unruh Act.   \n9  B.  A permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from knowing or con-\nsidering applicants’ race when making admission decisions. \n10 \n11  C.  Structural injunctive relief, including the appointment of a monitor to \noversee all decisions relating to admissions at UCLA Medical School, to \n12 \nensure compliance with federal law.  \n13 \nD.  An order requiring UCLA Medical School to admit Mahoney.  \n14 \nE.  An order certifying this action as a class action and appointing Mahoney \n15 \nand her counsel to represent any class and subclass. \n16 \nF.  Compensatory damages equivalent to a refund of any application fee(s) \n17  paid. \n18  G.  Statutory damages under the Unruh Act not less than $4,000 per occur-\nrence of discrimination. \n19 \n20  H.  Punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial. \n21  I.  Nominal damages of $1 per occurrence of discrimination. \n22 \nJ.  Disgorgement of federal financial assistance received by UCLA Medical \n23  School during the period in which it did not comply with federal law. \n24  K.  Reasonable costs and expenses of this action, including attorneys’ fees, \nunder 42 U.S.C. §1988 and any other applicable laws. \n25 \n26  L.  Pre- and post-judgment interest on any amounts awarded. \n27  M.  All other relief that the plaintiffs and the class are entitled to. \n28 \n  37 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-04131     Document 1     Filed 05/08/25     Page 38 of 38   Page ID #:38\n \n1  Dated: May 8, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n2 \n  /s/ Bryan Weir            \n3  LAWFAIR LLC  CONSOVOY MCCARTHY PLLC \nAdam K.
