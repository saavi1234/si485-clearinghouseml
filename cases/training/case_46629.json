SMITH on 8/8/2025.   The President has concluded that appropriately managed commercia l fishing should be allowed within the Monument Expansion. Persons of good faith might agree or disagree with the President's conclusion.  But this court does not sit in judgment of the wisdom of that policy. The only questions presented  here are legal ones: whether Plaintiffs have the procedural right to make the agency hear them out on the question of what restrictions are needed to ensure that commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion is indeed appropriately managed (and to ha ve that opportunity before commercial fishing is given the green light), and whether Plaintiffs have the right to vindicate their asserted procedural right in court.  For the reasons set out above, the court has concluded that Plaintiffs have  the right to present their legal claims in court--that is, they have Article III standing, and the APA authorizes this court to exercise judicial review of their claims. And as to whether Plaintiffs' claims are correct--whether Plaintiffs are r ight to contend that they are entitled to participate in a notice and comment procedure--the government has chosen to concede that they are.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on its fifth and sixth claims for relief, ECF No. 13, is GRANTED, and the National Marine Fisheries Service's April 25, 2025, letter is hereby VACATED.(jni)"

    "summary": "<p>This case challenged Proclamation 10918, signed by President Trump on April 17, 2025, which purported to open the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument to commercial fishing. The monument was established by President Bush in 2009 and was expanded by President Obama in 2014, both acting under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The 2009 Proclamation banned commercial fishing within the boundaries of the monument. On May 22, 2025, two environmental organizations and an unincorporated association brought this action in the District of Hawai'i against President Donald Trump, the Secretary of Commerce, the Acting Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Assistant Administrator for NOAA Fisheries, and the Secretary of the Interior.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation directing the Secretary of Commerce not to ban commercial fishing in the waters \"between 50 to 200 nautical miles from the landward boundaries of the Monument.\" The plaintiffs alleged that the Proclamation and ensuing activities taken to implement it violated the Antiquities Act, the Separation of Powers, the Take Care Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act, principally on the theory that once designated, a designated monument cannot be shrunken or eliminated without an act of Congress, but also that such actions are subject to procedural requirements that were not followed by the defendant agencies. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Wes R. Porter.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment for their procedural claims on June 24.

TRUMP, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nIn the heart of the Pacific Ocean to the south and west of the main Hawaiian \nIslands lay the pristine waters of Wake, Jarvis, Baker, and Howland Islands, Johnston \nand Palmyra Atolls, and Kingman Reef.  The waters are home to a unique ecosystem of \ncoral reefs and diverse marine species.  To protect the historic and scientific interests in \nthese waters, President George W. Bush designated the area in 2009 as a national \nmonument, which is now known as the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National \nMonument.  President Barack H. Obama expanded the Monument in 2014 to embrace a \nsubstantially larger share of the waters surrounding Wake and Jarvis Islands and \nJohnston Atoll.  And in the years since, the National Marine Fisheries Service, or \n“NMFS”—an agency within the Department of Commerce—has promulgated \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 2 of 51 \nPageID.3966\nregulations banning commercial fishing within the boundaries of the 2009 Monument \nand 2014 Monument Expansion using formal notice and comment procedures. \nIn an April 2025 Proclamation, President Donald J. Trump found that \n“appropriately managed commercial fishing” would not endanger the Monument \nExpansion.  Based on that finding, President Trump declared that the Secretary of \nCommerce “shall not prohibit commercial fishing” for U.S. flagged vessels in the \nMonument Expansion, and that the Secretary instead shall “take appropriate action” to \n“implement” the Proclamation and “expeditiously publish new proposed rules in the \nFederal Register to amend or repeal all burdensome regulations that restrict commercial \nfishing” in that area. \nTo date, the Secretary has not proposed any such rules.  But just over a week \nafter President Trump’s Proclamation, NMFS issued a letter informing permit holders \nthat commercial fishing is now fair game in the Monument Expansion.  The letter did \nnot merely suggest that NMFS would decline to enforce its existing regulations banning \ncommercial fishing there.  Nor did it simply suggest that commercial fishing would \nbecome lawful once NMFS had used notice and comment procedures to repeal existing \nregulations.  Instead, the letter took the position that those regulations no longer exist:  \nit asserted that President Trump’s Proclamation—which had only called for proposed \nrules to repeal existing regulations—had itself already done the work of rendering the \nexisting regulations “no longer effective.” \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 3 of 51 \nPageID.3967\nBecause NMFS took the position that it had no obligation to engage in notice and \ncomment procedures to repeal the existing regulations prohibiting commercial fishing, \nPlaintiffs—and the public more generally—were afforded no opportunity to comment \non whether specific types of commercial fishing, such as longline and purse seine \nfishing (which Plaintiffs contend are highly destructive), are consistent with the \n“appropriately managed commercial fishing” that President Trump had called for in his \nProclamation.  And in the wake of NMFS’s letter, commercial fishing operations—\nincluding those using longline and purse seine techniques—have begun in the \nMonument Expansion’s waters. \nInterested cultural and environmental organizations responded by filing this \nsuit, and they have now moved for summary judgment on two of their claims, which \nare based on the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n(Magnuson Act) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  Plaintiffs contend that \nNMFS violated these statutes by failing to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking \nbefore issuing its letter.  In its opposition, the government argues that Plaintiffs lack \nArticle III standing and that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider their claims.  But the \ngovernment has chosen not to defend the letter on the merits. \nThe court concludes that Plaintiffs have Article III standing and that it has \njurisdiction under the APA.  For these reasons, and because the government has \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 4 of 51 \nPageID.3968\nforfeited any argument on the merits of Plaintiffs’ notice-and-comment claims, \nPlaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.   \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Factual Background \n1.  The Monument and Expansion  \n  The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to “declare by public \nproclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects \nof historic or scientific interest that are situated on land owned or controlled by the \nFederal Government to be national monuments.”  54 U.S.C. § 320301(a).  It further \nauthorizes the President to “reserve parcels of land as a part of the national \nmonuments.”  Id. § 320301(b).   \na.   In 2009, President Bush invoked his authority under the Antiquities Act to \nissue a proclamation establishing what was at the time called the Pacific Remote Islands \nMarine National Monument.  Proclamation No. 8336, 74 Fed. Reg. 1565 (Jan. 6, 2009).  \nThe proclamation set aside the waters and submerged and emergent lands of Wake, \nJarvis, Baker, and Howland Islands, Johnston and Palmyra Atolls, and Kingman Reef to \na boundary line approximately fifty nautical miles from their mean low water lines.  Id. \nat 1565-67.  In establishing the Monument, the proclamation sought to protect the \nsignificant historic and scientific interests in the area, which is home to some of the most \npristine coral reefs in the world and diverse marine species, including various \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 5 of 51 \nPageID.3969\nthreatened and endangered species.  Id.  In furtherance of this aim, President Bush’s \nproclamation directed the Secretary of Commerce to “prohibit commercial fishing \nwithin the boundaries of the monument.”  Id. at 1568. \n  Shortly thereafter, the Regional Administrator for NMFS’s Pacific Islands \nRegional Office issued a letter to commercial fishing permit holders advising them of \nPresident Bush’s proclamation.  ECF No. 21-4, at PageID.1362 (AR at 000463).  The \nRegional Administrator is a high-ranking NMFS official responsible for, among other \nthings, approving, disapproving, and implementing fisheries management plans.  ECF \nNo. 30-2, at PageID.3894.  In the letter, the Regional Administrator took the position that \n“the commercial fishing prohibitions and other terms set out in the Presidential \nProclamation[] became immediately effective upon issuance of the Proclamation[],” and \nthat as a consequence, “all commercial fishing within the waters of the . . . marine \nNational Monument[] . . . is now prohibited.”  ECF No. 21-4, at PageID.1362 (AR at \n000463).  In taking this position, the Regional Administrator was not asserting that a \nPresidential proclamation had the authority to eliminate regulations passed through \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking;1 indeed, at that time, there were no formal regulations \nallowing commercial fishing in the newly-created Monument.  \n \n1   The detailed requirements of notice and comment procedures are \ndescribed infra at page 45.  For now, it suffices to say that these procedures ensure \n“interested persons an opportunity to participate in [an agency’s] rule making through \nsubmission of written data, views, or arguments.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(c). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 6 of 51 \nPageID.3970\nFollowing President Bush’s proclamation, NMFS engaged in notice and \ncomment procedures and ultimately published a final rule in 2013 establishing \nregulations that “codif[ied] certain provisions of the Proclamation,” including its \nprohibition on commercial fishing.  50 C.F.R. § 665.930 (2013); see also id. § 665.933(a) \n(2013) (prohibiting “[c]ommercial fishing in the Monument”); id. § 665.934(a) (2013) \n(same).  The regulations are found at 50 C.F.R. Part 665, subpart H.   \n  b.   In 2014, President Obama issued a proclamation under the Antiquities Act to \nsignificantly expand the Monument boundary lines.  Proclamation No. 9173, 79 Fed. \nReg. 58645 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The Monument Expansion area encompassed the waters \nand submerged lands of Jarvis and Wake Islands and Johnston Atoll from the prior \nMonument boundary lines to the seaward limit of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone of \neach island, up to 200 nautical miles from the landward boundaries.  Id. at 58647, 58651-\n53.   \nPresident Obama’s proclamation found that, much like the originally-designated \nMonument, the Expansion area provided an “important ecosystem for scientific study \nand research.”  Id. at 58646.  A significant feature of the area is undersea mountains, or \n“seamounts,” which are home to ancient deepwater corals and “pools of undiscovered \nspecies.”  Id. at 58645. \nOnce again, the proclamation directed the Secretary to “prohibit commercial \nfishing within the boundaries of the Monument Expansion.”  Id. at 58647.  And NMFS \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 7 of 51 \nPageID.3971\nfollowed this directive by engaging in notice and comment procedures and eventually \npublishing a final rule in 2015 that updated the regulations to codify President Obama’s \nnew ban on commercial fishing in the Expansion area.  80 Fed. Reg. 15693 (Mar. 25, \n2015) (codified at 50 C.F.R. pt. 665, subpt. H). \n    2.  President Trump’s Proclamation and NMFS’s Letter \n  On April 17, 2025, President Trump issued his own proclamation, titled \n“Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Pacific.”  Proclamation No. 10918, 90 \nFed. Reg. 16987 (Apr. 17, 2025) (hereinafter the “Proclamation”).  The Proclamation \nfound that “appropriately managed commercial fishing would not put the objects of \nscientific and historic interest that the [Monument] protects at risk.”  Id. at 16987.  \nAccordingly, it revised President Obama’s prior proclamation to state that in the \nMonument Expansion area, “[b]etween 50 and 200 nautical miles from the landward \nboundaries of the Monument, the Secretary of Commerce shall not prohibit commercial \nfishing.”  Id. at 16988.  But commercial fishing was not banned in the Monument \nExpansion merely through President Obama’s proclamation; as noted, formal \nregulations to that same effect had been promulgated through notice and comment \nprocedures.  And so President Trump’s Proclamation directed the Secretary to \n“expeditiously publish new proposed rules in the Federal Register to amend or repeal \nall burdensome regulations that restrict commercial fishing” in the Monument \nExpansion.  Id. at 16989.  Still, given that the Monument Expansion remains a protected \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 8 of 51 \nPageID.3972\narea under the Antiquities Act, the Proclamation also instructed the Secretary to “take \nappropriate action . . . to ensure proper care and management of the Monument \nExpansion.”  Id. at 16988.  \n  Following President Trump’s Proclamation, at least sixteen vessel owners and \noperators inquired about the implications for commercial fishing in the Monument \nExpansion.  ECF No. 30, at PageID.3879 (Pls.’ Further Concise Statement of Facts (CSF) \n¶ 4).  NMFS officials advised those who inquired in the week after the Proclamation \nwas issued that an “official” letter was forthcoming.  ECF No. 28-2, at PageID.3834.   \nOn April 25, 2025, the Regional Administrator for NMFS’s Pacific Islands \nRegional Office sent a letter to all permit holders in the Hawai‘i and American Samoa \nlongline fisheries and U.S. purse seine2 vessel owners operating in the Western and \nCentral Pacific Ocean.  ECF No. 30, at PageID.3875 (Pls.’ Further CSF ¶ 1).  The letter \ninformed the permit holders “that commercial fishing is no longer prohibited in certain \nareas of the” Monument.  ECF No. 14-22, at PageID.795.  It recited that President Trump \nissued the Proclamation, which “amended [President Obama’s prior proclamation] to \nremove the commercial fishing prohibition in the areas 50-200 nautical miles created by \n[the prior proclamation], and became effective upon issuance on April 17, 2025.”  Id.  \nBut the letter also took the position that President Trump’s Proclamation did more than \n \n2   Longline fishing “deploys baited hooks along mainlines of up to sixty nautical \nmiles in length.”  ECF No. 13-1, at PageID.132.  Purse seine fishing “uses massive nets \nnearly a mile in length and 500 feet in depth to scoop up metric tons of catch.”  Id. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 9 of 51 \nPageID.3973\nmerely revise President Obama’s earlier proclamation; in NMFS’s view, it also \neffectively eliminated the formal regulations banning commercial fishing in the \nMonument Expansion, which had been passed through notice and comment \nprocedures.  As the letter put it, “[a]s a result” of President Trump’s Proclamation, \n“federal regulations at 50 CFR §§ 665.933(a) and 665.934(a) implementing [President \nObama’s proclamation’s] commercial fishing prohibition are no longer effective.”  Id.  \nThe letter went on to remind permit holders that commercial fishing “remains \nprohibited” in the original Monument area, and it provided coordinates and a map \ndepicting the still-prohibited fishing areas.  Id.  Finally, the letter noted that NMFS \n“plan[s] to expeditiously initiate rulemaking to bring fishing regulations into \ncompliance” with President Trump’s Proclamation.  Id.   \nIn addition to sending the letter to permit holders, NMFS posted the contents of \nthe letter on its official government website.  ECF No. 30-3, at PageID.3896-97.  \nMeanwhile, no regulations have yet been formally proposed. \nB.  Procedural Background \nIn May 2025, three cultural and environmental organizations filed suit, \nchallenging the legality of President Trump’s Proclamation and NMFS’s letter.  ECF No. \n1.  Plaintiffs include Kāpa‘a, which is a hui, or unincorporated association, of Native \nHawaiian cultural practitioners, id. at PageID.11 (¶ 25); the Conservation Council for \nHawai‘i, a non-profit citizens’ organization based in Hawai‘i, id. at PageID.16 (¶ 35); \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 10 of 51 \nPageID.3974\nand the Center for Biological Diversity, a non-profit environmental organization, id. at \nPageID.19 (¶ 43).  In the lawsuit, Plaintiffs assert that the Proclamation exceeded \nPresident Trump’s authority under the Antiquities Act and Article II of the U.S. \nConstitution and violated the Take Care Clause of Article II, Section 3 of the \nConstitution.  Id. at PageID.69-72 (¶¶ 183-97).  Plaintiffs further bring claims against \nagency officials under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Magnuson \nAct, and the APA.  Id. at PageID.72-81 (¶¶ 198-236).  \nAt this stage, Plaintiffs have filed a motion for summary judgment on just two of \ntheir claims, counts five and six, which allege that agency officials violated the \nMagnuson Act and the APA when NMFS issued the April 25, 2025, letter purporting to \nrevise the commercial fishing rules without engaging in notice-and-comment \nrulemaking.  ECF No. 13.  The government opposes the motion solely on the grounds \nthat the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.  ECF No. \n23.  The court held a hearing on the motion on August 5, 2025.  ECF No. 35.  Both \nPlaintiffs and Defendants were ably represented by their respective counsel. \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD \nSummary judgment is warranted where a movant shows there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  Summary judgment lies only where no “reasonable jury \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 11 of 51 \nPageID.3975\ncould return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 248 (1986). \nSummary judgment “is a particularly appropriate tool for resolving claims \nchallenging agency action.”  Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Haaland, 562 F. Supp. 3d 68, 76 \n(D. Ariz. 2021) (cleaned up).  That is because in administrative agency cases, “the \ndistrict court’s role is not to resolve facts, but to ‘determine whether or not as a matter \nof law the evidence in the administrative record permitted the agency to make the \ndecision it did.’”  Id. (quoting Occidental Eng’g Co. v. INS, 753 F.2d 766, 769 (9th Cir. \n1985)). \nDISCUSSION \nA.  Article III Standing \n \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. \nof Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).  They possess only the authority expressly granted by \nthe U.S. Constitution and by statute.  Id.  For this reason, it is presumed that a case lies \noutside a federal court’s jurisdiction, and the party seeking to avail itself of the court’s \njurisdiction has the burden to establish that it exists.  Id.; see also Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  Article III of the U.S. Constitution limits federal courts’ \nadjudication powers to “Cases” and “Controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  And \na dispute does not count as a constitutional case or controversy if the plaintiff lacks \nArticle III standing—that is, a concrete stake in the outcome.  Town of Chester, N.Y. v. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 12 of 51 \nPageID.3976\nLaroe Estates, Inc., 581 U.S. 433, 438 (2017).  A plaintiff must “demonstrate standing for \neach claim they seek to press.”  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 570 (9th Cir. 2018).  At \nthe summary judgment stage, a plaintiff must “set forth by affidavit or other evidence \nspecific facts, which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be \ntrue.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (cleaned up). \nPlaintiffs assert a theory of associational—or “representational”—standing, \nunder which they can sue on behalf of their members even if the organizations \nthemselves have not suffered an injury.  Fleck & Assocs., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, 471 F.3d \n1100, 1105 (9th Cir. 2006).  To establish Article III associational standing, Plaintiffs must \nestablish that (1) at least one of their members would have standing to sue in their own \nright, (2) the interests at stake are germane to the organizations’ purpose, and \n(3) neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested requires the individual members \nto participate in the suit.  Id. at 1105-06.  To show member standing, in turn, Plaintiffs \nmust demonstrate that at least one of their members (1) has suffered an injury in fact, \n(2) that is fairly traceable to the defendants’ challenged conduct, and (3) that is likely \nredressable through a favorable judicial decision.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61.   \nThe scientific, cultural, spiritual, recreational, and other interests at stake in this \nlawsuit over commercial fishing in a national monument are unquestionably germane \nto the purpose of Kāpa‘a, which is an association of Native Hawaiian cultural \npractitioners that was formed “to support the creation, protection, and expansion of \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 13 of 51 \nPageID.3977\nthe” Monument and “to oppose efforts to remove” its protections.  ECF No. 14-1, at \nPageID.155 (Solomon Pili Kaho‘ohalahala Decl.).  They are also germane to the \nenvironmental nonprofit Plaintiffs’ purposes.  See, e.g., ECF No. 14-2, at PageID.166 \n(Jonnetta Peters Decl.) (stating that the Conservation Council for Hawai‘i‘s mission is \n“to protect for future generations Hawai‘i’s native wildlife, . . .  and to restore the \necosystems on which [threatened and endangered] species depend,” including within \nthe Monument); ECF No. 14-7, at PageID.190 (Maxx Phillips Decl.) (explaining that the \nCenter for Biological Diversity is “dedicated to the protection of native, threatened and \nendangered species and their habitats”).  It is also undisputed that nothing indicates \nthat the claims asserted or the relief requested requires Plaintiffs’ individual members \nto participate in this suit.  And so the court turns to the question of whether at least one \nof Plaintiffs’ members would have standing to sue in their own right, which is the \ndisputed element here. \n1.   Plaintiffs allege injuries arising from the agency’s failure to engage in the \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking required by the Magnuson Act and the APA before \nasserting that the ban on commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion was gone.  To \nadequately assert an injury in fact for Article III purposes, plaintiffs must show not only \ndeprivation of a procedural right, but also that “some concrete interest . . . is affected by \nthe deprivation.”  Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 496 (2009).  In \nenvironmental cases, the concrete interest requirement is generally satisfied if any \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 14 of 51 \nPageID.3978\nmember has an adequate “aesthetic or recreational interest in a particular place, or \nanimal, or plant species” and can show that their interest is “impaired” by the \nchallenged action.  Ecological Rights Found. v. Pac. Lumber Co., 230 F.3d 1141, 1147 (9th \nCir. 2000).  In most cases, the injury must be actual or imminent.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \n“Where plaintiffs allege a ‘procedural injury,’” however—“that is, that the \ngovernment’s violation of a procedural requirement could impair some separate \ninterest of the plaintiffs’—the normal standards for the immediacy of injury are \nrelaxed.”  Navajo Nation v. Dep’t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, 1160 (9th Cir. 2017) \n(cleaned up) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7).  Under the relaxed standards, Plaintiffs \nneed only demonstrate (1) that they have a procedural right that, if exercised, could \nhave protected their concrete interests, (2) that the procedures in question are designed \nto protect those concrete interests, and (3) that the challenged action’s threat to their \nconcrete interests is reasonably probable.  Azar, 911 F.3d at 570.  To satisfy the first two \nof these prongs, “environmental plaintiffs must allege that they will suffer harm by \nvirtue of their geographic proximity to and use of areas that will be affected by” the \nchallenged action.  California v. Bernhardt, 460 F. Supp. 3d 875, 890 (N.D. Cal. 2020) \n(citing Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, 971 (9th Cir. 2003)). \nThe injuries Plaintiffs assert here are sufficient to meet Article III’s relaxed \nstandard for procedural injury.

See ECF No. 14-1 \n(Kaho‘ohalahala Decl.); ECF No. 14-2 (Peters Decl.); ECF No. 14-3 (Brian Zgliczynski \nDecl.); ECF No. 14-7 (Phillips Decl.); ECF No. 14-8 (Stuart A. Sandin, Ph.D, Decl.); see \nalso Nat’l Fam. Farm Coal. v. EPA, 966 F.3d 893, 909 (9th Cir. 2020) (noting that plaintiffs \n“who use the area threatened by a proposed action . . . have little difficulty establishing \na concrete interest” (cleaned up)).  Moreover, Plaintiffs have statutory procedural rights \nin notice-in-comment rulemaking that, if exercised, could have protected their concrete \ninterests in the Monument Expansion by ensuring that public comment was taken into \naccount and by potentially changing the specific regulations on different types of \ncommercial fishing; notice and comment procedures are designed to protect these \nconcrete interests; and the threat to Plaintiffs’ concrete interests arising from NMFS \nauthorizing commercial fishing is reasonably probable.  See, e.g., ECF No. 14-14, at \nPageID.258 (Alan M. Friedlander Decl. ¶ 49) (attesting that “[e]ven a small amount of \nfishing in the Monument Expansion threatens significant harms to ecosystems and \nspecies”).3 \n \n3   According to an unrebutted scientific opinion submitted by Plaintiffs, \ncommercial fishing harms ecosystems and species in the Monument Expansion through \nthe (1) “indirect effects of harvesting targeted species (i.e., tunas) on seabird foraging \ndynamics”; (2) “direct effects of bycatch on many declining or listed species including \nsea turtles, sharks, and seabirds”; and (3) “direct effects of derelict fishing gear and \nvessel pollution on ecosystems and species.”  ECF No. 14-14, at PageID.258 (Friedlander \nDecl. ¶ 49). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 16 of 51 \nPageID.3980\n2.   Once a plaintiff has established a procedural injury, the causation and \nredressability elements of member standing are relaxed.  Azar, 911 F.3d at 571.  The \ngovernment nonetheless presses on the element of causation; it argues that Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries are not fairly traceable to the letter because it is the President’s Proclamation, \nand not the agency’s letter, that lifted the commercial fishing ban in the Monument \nExpansion.  ECF No. 23, at PageID.3758-60. \nThat argument is not convincing.  While it is true that the agency’s letter must be \na “substantial factor” in causing Plaintiffs’ injuries, Novak v. United States, 795 F.3d 1012, \n1019 (9th Cir. 2015) (cleaned up), it is equally true that “causation does not require that \nthe defendant’s unlawful conduct be the only cause of the alleged injury,” Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil v. EPA, 38 F.4th 34, 55 (9th Cir. 2022) (emphasis added).  And the government’s \nown submissions show that commercial fishing did not begin in the Monument \nExpansion area based on the Proclamation alone.  The government represents that \nNMFS had received at least sixteen inquiries from longline vessel owners or \noperators—that is, commercial fishers—asking whether they could legally fish in the \nMonument Expansion area following the Proclamation.  ECF No. 28, at PageID.3826 \n(Defs.’ CSF ¶ 4); see also ECF No. 23, at PageID.3770.  This evidence shows that the \nstatus of commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion area following the \nProclamation was unclear to permit holders.  It was unclear in part because the \nProclamation directed NMFS to take action:  while the Proclamation stated that “the \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 17 of 51 \nPageID.3981\nSecretary of Commerce shall not prohibit commercial fishing within the” Monument \nExpansion, it directed the Secretary of Commerce to “take appropriate action . . . to \nimplement this proclamation.”  ECF No. 14-29, at PageID.857.  As a result, commercial \nfisheries were apparently unwilling to take the risk of fishing based on the \nProclamation alone.  Against this backdrop, the letter had significant consequences—it \ninformed permit holders that they could immediately commence commercial fishing in \nthe area, and that they need not wait for NMFS to use notice and comment procedures \nto repeal the prohibition in existing regulations.  The evidence shows that permit \nholders then acted on those representations:  while no commercial fishing took place in \nthe Monument Expansion between the issuance of the Proclamation on April 17, 2025, \nand that of the letter on April 25, 2025, commercial fishing operations commenced after \nthe letter was issued.  See ECF No. 14-14, at PageID.256-58 (Friedlander Decl. ¶¶ 47-48) \n(cataloguing commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion since the April 25, 2025, \nletter). \nGranted, Plaintiffs’ injuries are most immediately being caused by these \ncommercial fishing operations, which are not parties to this suit; there is no allegation \nthat the government is itself engaged in commercial fishing in the Monument \nExpansion.  And harms by third parties can sometimes be too attenuated from the \nchallenged conduct to establish causation for the purposes of Article III.  For an injury \nto be “fairly traceable” to the government’s conduct, for example, it must not be the \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 18 of 51 \nPageID.3982\nresult of the entirely independent choices of a third party.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is \nwhy, for example, the district court in Cary v. Hall held that a plaintiff who suffered \ninjury because of the sport hunting of wild antelope in North Africa (where he worked \nwith them) could not show a sufficient causal connection to a regulation authorizing the \ntaking of captive-bred antelope in the United States.  No. C 05-4363, 2006 WL 6198320, \nat *5-7 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2006).  As that court observed, “the challenged regulation \nneither authorizes sport hunting in North Africa nor authorizes the importation of \ntrophies taken in the wild,” and so the “causal connection” between the regulation and \ninjury was “too speculative” and reliant on “the unfettered decisions of third parties.”  \nId. at *7. \nBut other times, the choices of third parties are not independent of government \naction.  When a plaintiff “adduce[s] facts showing that those choices have been or will \nbe made in such a manner” as to reflect that they are substantially being caused by \ngovernment action, the causation element is satisfied.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That can \nbe the case, for example, when a plaintiff’s Article III standing argument \n“relies instead on the predictable effect of Government action on the decisions of third \nparties.”  Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019); see also Idaho Conservation \nLeague v. Mumma, 956 F.2d 1508, 1517-18 (9th Cir. 1992) (rejecting the argument that the \nplaintiffs’ injury was not caused by a government action but instead would ultimately \nbe “the result of a confluence of factors, including the actions of . . . private parties,” \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 19 of 51 \nPageID.3983\nbecause the “third parties could not undertake their future actions but for the challenged \ndecision”).  Following this reasoning, the district court in WildEarth Guardians v. Chao \nfound sufficient evidence of a causal connection where a plaintiff suffering injury from \nthe conduct of pipeline operators challenged the government’s failure to cause annual \ninspections of pipelines.  454 F. Supp. 3d 944, 947 (D. Mont. 2020).  As the court \nexplained, the “fact that pipeline operators’ actions or decisions may constitute a step in \nthe causation chain does not mean the injury is not ‘fairly traceable’ to” the agency \nwhere “the alleged injury [wa]s ‘produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the \naction of someone else.’”  Id. (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997)).  That \nwas especially so, the court observed, because the government had offered no evidence \nthat, in the absence of annual inspections, “pipeline operators either are complying, or \nare failing to comply, with regulations.”  Id.; see also Mendia v. Garcia, 768 F.3d 1009, \n1012-13 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding causation where the chain of events linking the \ndefendant’s conduct to the injury was plausible, even if indirect or not the final step). \nHere, Plaintiffs have made a similarly sufficient showing on causation.  They \nproduced evidence that permit holders inquired about the lawfulness of commercial \nfishing following the Proclamation; that the agency issued its formal letter stating that \nthe ban on commercial fishing had been lifted without the need for notice-and-comment \nrulemaking; and that permit holders began fishing only after they had received this \nfirm and sweeping reassurance.  This record is sufficient to establish that the \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 20 of 51 \nPageID.3984\ncommercial fishing now occurring in the Monument Expansion—the conduct most \nimmediately causing Plaintiffs’ concrete injury—was “produced by [the] determinative \nor coercive effect [of NMFS’s letter] upon the action” of commercial fishing operations.  \nWildEarth Guardians, 454 F. Supp. 3d at 947 (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169). \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs correctly point out that the Proclamation itself did not \ndelineate what types of commercial fishing practices should be allowed in the \nMonument Expansion.  It instead found only that “appropriately managed commercial \nfishing would not put objects of scientific and historic interest” at risk.  ECF No. 14-29, \nat PageID.857 (emphasis added).  It left the “implementation of any regulation of \ncommercial fishing” to the Secretary.  Id.  And while it restricted the Secretary from \nbanning commercial fishing altogether, it also directed the Secretary to “take \nappropriate action” to “implement” the Proclamation, “to regulate fisheries, and to \nensure proper care and management of the Monument Expansion.”  Id.  That is, the \nSecretary could still implement specific regulations to regulate the scope and types of \ncommercial fishing, even while he was required to “amend or repeal all burdensome \nregulations that restrict commercial fishing” in the Monument Expansion.  Id. at \nPageID.858.  Plaintiffs suggest that NMFS could have, for example, set catch limits on \nfishing in the Monument Expansion; set a maximum number of hours for commercial \nfishing; increased its observer coverage on commercial fishing boats; or banned \nparticular types of commercial fishing, such as the allegedly particularly harmful \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 21 of 51 \nPageID.3985\nlongline and purse seine fishing techniques.  But NMFS instead chose to take the \nposition in its letter that the regulations banning commercial fishing were immediately \neliminated, and that it had no need to bother with notice and comment procedures to \naccomplish that result.  It therefore effectively took the position that specific types of \ncommercial fishing, such as longline and purse seine fishing, are immediately \npermissible within the Monument Expansion’s waters, even though NMFS has not yet \nengaged in notice and comment procedures to assess whether they are consistent with \n“appropriately managed” commercial fishing in those waters.  The use of longline and \npurse seine fishing in the Monument Expansion, then, is “fairly traceable” to the legal \nposition NMFS asserted in its letter.  WildEarth Guardians, 454 F. Supp.3d at 947. \nBecause the letter is the substantial cause of both commercial fishing in the \nMonument Expansion and the use of the commercial fishing practices that Plaintiffs \nallege are especially destructive, the court concludes that Plaintiffs have amply \ndemonstrated a sufficient causal connection between the letter and their asserted injury. \n3.   In a similar vein, the government argues that Plaintiffs’ requested relief—\nstriking down the letter—would not redress their asserted injuries because it is the \nProclamation, and not the letter, that authorizes commercial fishing in the Monument \nExpansion area.  In the government’s view, the letter did no more than “inform \ncommercial fishery permit holders of the content of [President Trump’s] Proclamation.”  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 22 of 51 \nPageID.3986\nECF No. 23, at PageID.3761.  And so even if the court found in Plaintiffs’ favor on these \nclaims, the government posits, Plaintiffs’ injury would not be redressed. \nBecause Plaintiffs assert procedural injuries, they need only prove that the \nsubstantive result could have been different had NMFS followed the proper procedures \nfor notice and comment—not that it certainly would be.  See Azar, 911 F.3d at 571.  The \ngovernment’s line of reasoning falls short for reasons similar to those that fell its \ncausation arguments.  It is likely that setting aside the letter would redress Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries, both because fisheries are evidently relying on the letter—and so at least some \nare likely to stop fishing if the letter is set aside—and because the missing notice and \ncomment procedures could conceivably result in a more limited set of commercial \nfishing operations allowed in the Monument Expansion than the letter’s sweeping \nauthorization of all commercial fishing previously allowed outside the Monument \nExpansion. \nFor these reasons, the court concludes that Plaintiffs have met their burden of \nestablishing that they have Article III standing to assert the Magnuson Act and APA \nclaims for which they seek summary judgment.4 \n \n \n4   Plaintiffs—whose members include experts who wish to make submissions \nduring any notice and comment procedure—have also amply demonstrated that they \nfall within the zone of interests protected by these statutes, see Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 \nF.3d 670, 702-03 (9th Cir. 2019), which is likely why the government does not argue \notherwise.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 23 of 51 \nPageID.3987\nB.  The Availability of Judicial Review  \nBecause Plaintiffs have shown that they possess Article III standing, they have \nestablished that Congress could constitutionally authorize this court to exercise judicial \nreview of the agency conduct they challenge.  Their remaining burden is to show that \nCongress has done so here. \nOne potential source of authority is Section 1855(f) of the Magnuson Act, which \nauthorizes judicial review for two categories of agency action if a petition for review is \nfiled within thirty days:  (1) “[r]egulations promulgated by the Secretary” under the \nAct, and (2) “actions that are taken by the Secretary under regulations which implement \na fishery management plan, including but not limited to actions that establish the date \nof closure of a fishery to commercial or recreational fishing.”  16 U.S.C. § 1855(f)(1), (2).  \nBut the government argues—and Plaintiffs agree—that § 1855(f) does not apply here \nbecause the letter is neither a “promulgated” regulation nor an action taken under one.  \nECF No. 23, at PageID.3762-65 (Defs.’ Opp.); ECF No. 29, at PageID.3862-63 (Pls.’ \nReply).  A regulation is “promulgated” within the meaning of § 1855(f) only “when \npublished in the Federal Register.”  Turtle Island Restoration Network v. U.S. Dep’t of \nCom., 438 F.3d 937, 943-44 (9th Cir. 2006) (cleaned up).  And all parties agree that no \nsuch publication occurred here.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ Magnuson Act claim rests on that \nvery failure:  Plaintiffs argue that NMFS should not have adopted the position it \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 24 of 51 \nPageID.3988\nannounced in the letter without first publishing a proposed regulation in the Federal \nRegister and complying with notice and comment procedures. \nThe fact that § 1855(f) is inapplicable here, however, does not mean that no \njudicial review is available for Plaintiffs’ Magnuson Act claim.  Even when § 1855(f) \ndoes not apply, judicial review of a Magnuson Act claim may be available under the \nAPA, which authorizes judicial review of final agency action “for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court.”5  5 U.S.C. § 704; see also N.C. Fisheries Ass’n v. \nGutierrez, 550 F.3d 16, 21 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (recognizing that APA review “would appear” \nto be available for final agency action that violates the Magnuson Act).  And while \n§ 1855(f) excludes Plaintiffs’ claims from judicial review under that provision, nothing \nin the Magnuson Act precludes APA review here.  See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 \n(confirming that “[n]othing in the” Endangered Species Act’s “citizen-suit provision” \nprecluded “review under the APA”).  And so the court’s jurisdiction over the merits of \n \n5   Because § 1855(f) imposes a thirty-day time limit on seeking judicial review, the \nNinth Circuit has held that parties cannot avoid its restraints simply by declining to \nmention the Magnuson Act in their complaint (and, for example, seeking review only \nunder the APA).  See Turtle Island Restoration Network, 438 F.3d at 944-45.  But § 1855(f) \nand its restrictions apply only to promulgated regulations, given the “highly detailed and \npublic process leading up” to their adoption.  Id. at 947-48.  As the Ninth Circuit has \nexplained, § 1855(f) does not exempt from judicial oversight environmental claims \nrelated to commercial fisheries that do not challenge promulgated regulations.  Id. at \n948-49.  There are many classes of claims “left untouched by § 1855(f),” id. at 949—this is \none of them. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 25 of 51 \nPageID.3989\nboth of Plaintiffs’ claims here—the Magnuson Act claim and the claim brought under \nthe APA itself—turns on the APA’s judicial review provision.  \nThe APA embodies a “strong presumption favoring judicial review of \nadministrative action.”  Cmty. Legal Servs. in E. Palo Alto v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. \nServs., 137 F.4th 932, 939 (9th Cir. 2025) (quoting Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.S. \n480, 486 (2015)).  Even so, the APA grants courts jurisdiction to review only “final \nagency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  And here, while Plaintiffs maintain that NMFS’s letter \nqualifies as final agency action within the meaning of the APA, the government \ncontends that it does not. \n  1.  Agency Action \nThe government first argues that the letter is not agency action at all.  ECF No. \n23, at PageID.3766.  Agency action under the APA is defined as “the whole or a part of \nan agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or \nfailure to act.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13).  And an agency rule, in turn, is broadly defined to \ninclude a “statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to \nimplement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.”  Id. § 551(4).  This definition includes \ninterpretive rules as well as binding rules with the force of law.  Waterkeeper All. v. EPA, \n140 F.4th 1193, 1206 (9th Cir. 2025). \nThe letter in this case reflects a statement of the agency’s position on the \nlawfulness of commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion.  Whether that statement \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 26 of 51 \nPageID.3990\nis a binding rule or an interpretive one—that is, whether it is designed to implement, \ninterpret, or prescribe law—it is plainly agency action within the meaning of the APA.  \nSee id. (concluding that an EPA report constituted a rule because it “plainly reflect[ed] a \nstatement of the agency’s position with respect to” the Clean Water Act).   \nThe government separately argues that the letter was not action taken by the \nagency because it was issued by the Regional Administrator, and not the Secretary.  \nECF No. 23, at PageID.3769.  In making this argument, the government relies on the \nprinciple that a court may not exercise judicial review over the merely tentative ruling \nof a “subordinate official.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992) (quoting \nAbbott Lab’ys v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 151 (1967)).  And to be sure, the Regional \nAdministrator is not the highest ranking official within the Department of Commerce; in \nthat sense, she is “subordinate” to some other officials.  But she is not a lowly official \nlacking authority to bind the agency; she is a high-ranking official with substantial \nauthority.  The Magnuson Act defines “Secretary” to mean “the Secretary of Commerce \nor his designee.”  16 U.S.C. § 1802(39) (emphasis added).  The Secretary has delegated the \nprimary responsibility to manage United States fisheries to NMFS.  And the Pacific \nIslands Regional Administrator, in particular, has the delegated authority to approve, \ndisapprove, and implement fishery management plans.  ECF No. 30-2, at PageID.3894; \nsee S. Cal. Aerial Advertisers’ Ass’n v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 881 F.2d 672, 675 (9th Cir. \n1989) (rejecting argument that judicial review was not available because the challenged \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 27 of 51 \nPageID.3991\nletter was authored by the agency’s Assistant Manager rather than the Secretary where \nthe agency was charged with carrying out the Secretary’s duties for aviation safety). \nMoreover, there is nothing in the record that suggests the Regional \nAdministrator acted out of line; all signs point to the letter representing the position of \nthe agency.  Consider, for example, the sequence of events leading up to the letter’s \nissuance.  The vessel owners and operators had not initially reached out to the Regional \nAdministrator herself with the inquiries that the government says instigated the April \n25, 2025, letter; instead, they had contacted a NMFS Fisheries Management Specialist, \nwho then notified his supervisors of the inquiries.  ECF No. 28-1, at PageID.3832-33 \n(Jason Mehlinger Decl. ¶¶ 3-5).  The Specialist’s call log, moreover, indicates that he \ninformed these permit holders that an “official” letter from the agency was \nforthcoming.  ECF No. 28-2, at PageID.3834.  And the letter was sent out not only to \nthose who made the initial inquiries, but to all permit holders in the Hawai‘i and \nAmerican Samoa longline fisheries and to all U.S. purse seine vessel owners operating \nin the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.  ECF No. 30, at PageID.3875 (Pls.’ Further \nCSF ¶ 1).   \nThe language of the letter itself is also instructive.  By its plain terms, it speaks on \nbehalf of the agency:  it says that “[w]e plan to expeditiously initiate rulemaking to bring \nfishing regulations into compliance” with President Trump’s Proclamation.  ECF No. \n14-22, at PageID.795 (emphasis added); accord City of San Diego v. Whitman, 242 F.3d \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 28 of 51 \nPageID.3992\n1097, 1102 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001) (rejecting government’s contention that an EPA letter \n“represents only the ‘regional administrator’s opinion’” because the letter stated it was \nan “EPA interpret[ation]” (emphasis omitted)).  And the letter directs permit holders \nwith questions to reach out not to the Regional Administrator herself, but to the \nAssistant Regional Administrator.  ECF No. 14-22, at PageID.795.  These are not the \nwords one would expect to find in a letter meant to reflect only the views of a single \nindividual; they strongly indicate that the Regional Administrator was writing for the \nagency, rather than herself alone. \nWhat is more, the record establishes that after the letter was issued, others within \nthe agency treated it as the agency’s official position.  For example, the contents of the \nletter were published on NMFS’s official website on a news webpage.  ECF No. 30-3, at \nPageID.3896-97.  The webpage says only that the user is on “[a]n official website of the \nUnited States government” and that it was “[l]ast updated by the Pacific Islands \nRegional Office” on April 25, 2025; it says nothing to suggest that the statement \nrepresents the views only of the Regional Administrator, let alone that the Regional \nAdministrator was acting only on her own behalf in issuing the letter.  Id.   \nAnd while the government emphasizes that the Regional Administrator lacked \nthe authority to promulgate formal regulations, there is no evident reason why she \nwould have lacked the authority to announce the agency’s position that commercial \nfishing could commence before any formal regulations are promulgated.  In any case, \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 29 of 51 \nPageID.3993\nthe government’s points about the Regional Administrator’s delegated powers have \nlittle force here, given that actors who admittedly do have the authority to issue formal \nregulations—including the Secretary himself—have fully embraced the substance of the \nRegional Administrator’s letter in this court.  The Secretary of Commerce, the Acting \nAdministrator of NOAA, and the Assistant Administrator of NOAA are all named \nDefendants in this case, and the government’s summary judgment briefing was filed in \neach of their names.  And their brief wholeheartedly adopts the letter’s position that the \ncommercial fishing prohibitions codified at 50 C.F.R. Part 665, subpart H, were wiped \naway by President Trump’s Proclamation and that NMFS therefore had no need to \nrepeal those existing regulations using notice and comment procedures.  E.g., ECF No. \n23, at PageID.3766 (“The letter merely communicated that [President Trump’s] \nProclamation . . . lifted the restriction on commercial fishing within the Monument \nExpansion area.”).  Accordingly, while the government emphasizes that the Regional \nAdministrator lacks some of the formal authority that Defendants in this case possess, it \nwould “be adherence to a mere technicality to give any credence to this contention.”  \nAbbott Lab’ys, 387 U.S. at 152 (rejecting the government’s contention that a \nCommissioner’s action did not speak for the Attorney General where there was “no \nrepresentation that the Attorney General and the Commissioner disagree,” and “the \nJustice Department is defending this very suit”). \n \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 30 of 51 \nPageID.3994\n  2.  Final Agency Action \nThe government next argues that even if the letter is agency action, it is not \n“final” agency action.  The Supreme Court has explained that “two conditions must be \nsatisfied for agency action to be ‘final.’”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177.  The first of these is \nthat “the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” \nand “must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.”  Id. at 177-78 (cleaned \nup).  The second condition is that “the action must be one by which rights or obligations \nhave been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Id. at 178 (cleaned \nup).  The analysis of these conditions “requires focus on the practical and legal effects of \nthe agency action, not on labels, and finality is interpreted in a pragmatic and flexible \nmanner.”  Waterkeeper All., 140 F.4th at 1207 (cleaned up). \nA common way to approach this question is to “look to whether the action \namounts to a definitive statement of the agency’s position or has a direct and immediate \neffect on the day-to-day operations of the subject party, or if immediate compliance \nwith the terms is expected.”  Whitewater Draw Nat. Res. Conservation Dist. v. Mayorkas, 5 \nF.4th 997, 1007 (9th Cir. 2021).  In so doing, courts generally distinguish between \n“informational” documents “that merely provide[] the agency’s interpretation of a \nstatute,” Advanced Integrative Med. Sci. Inst., PLLC v. Garland, 24 F.4th 1249, 1258 (9th Cir. \n2022) (citing Whitman, 242 F.3d 1097), and agency “decision[s]” that “determine[] how a \nstatute or regulation applies to facts for enforcement purposes,” id. (citing U.S. Army \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 31 of 51 \nPageID.3995\nCorps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 599-600 (2016)).  Given the “pragmatic” \nnature of the inquiry, the form of a document is not dispositive.  Id. at 1260 (quoting \nHawkes, 578 U.S. at 599).  If a document, viewed with appropriate sensitivity to context, \nis akin to “the type of workaday advice letter that agencies prepare countless times per \nyear in dealing with the regulated community, and is little more than a restatement of \nstatute and regulations in a response to a request for assistance,” then it is not final \nagency action.  Id. (cleaned up).  If, on the other hand, the document is “issued after \nextensive factfinding, or after a public hearing, or after a series of formal written \nnotices,” or if circumstances otherwise indicate that the agency has bound itself to a \nparticular course of action—such as a new threat of sanctions or the extension of a safe \nharbor—it falls within the APA’s definition of final agency action.  Id. (citations \nomitted). \nA few examples are illustrative of this distinction.  In United States Army Corps of \nEngineers v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, the Supreme Court held that a jurisdictional \ndetermination, or “JD,” issued by the Army Corps of Engineers, which gave the \nagency’s definitive view on whether a particular piece of property contained wetlands \nsubject to the Clean Water Act, was final agency action.  On the first Bennett prong, the \nCourt noted that the JD undisputedly “mark[ed] the consummation of the Corps’ \ndecisionmaking process” because it was “issued after extensive factfinding” and would \n“typically not [be] revisited.”  Id. at 597-98 (cleaned up).  For “all practical purposes,” \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 32 of 51 \nPageID.3996\nthen, the agency had “ruled definitively that respondents’ property contain[ed] \njurisdictional waters.”  Id. at 598 (cleaned up). \nOn the second Bennett prong, the Supreme Court determined that the JD’s \n“definitive nature” gave “rise to ‘direct and appreciable legal consequences.’”  Id. \n(quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178).  The Court explained that a JD stating that a party’s \nproperty does not contain jurisdictional waters—or a “negative” JD—would effectively \ncreate a “safe harbor” from civil enforcement proceedings under the Clean Water Act \nbecause the government had firmly committed to abide by such a determination for a \nperiod of five years.  Id.  Similarly, the Court reasoned, “affirmative” JDs “have legal \nconsequences as well:  they represent the denial of the safe harbor that negative JDs \nafford.”  Id. at 599 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(13), for the definition of “agency action” as an \nagency “rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent,” or the “denial thereof”).  \nThe court therefore concluded that affirmative JDs constitute final agency action.  Id. \nOn the other side of the coin is Advanced Integrative Medical Science Institution, \nPLLC v. Garland, a Ninth Circuit case involving a letter sent by the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA) in response to an attorney’s letter seeking guidance on how a \nphysician could administer a drug without incurring liability under the Controlled \nSubstances Act.  24 F.4th at 1252.  Concluding that the letter did not constitute final \nagency action, the Ninth Circuit explained that unlike in Hawkes, there was no \nindication that the agency “engaged in a decisionmaking process resulting in the \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 33 of 51 \nPageID.3997\nresponse letter,” and that the letter “did no more than point to the plain language of \nexisting law.”  Id. at 1261.  The letter did not commit the DEA to non-enforcement of \nany law, and it thus granted no safe harbor.  Because it instead merely provided \nguidance on existing law, and imposed no legal consequences of its own, a physician \nrelying on the letter would “face liability only for noncompliance” with the underlying \nAct, “not for disagreement with the agency’s determination.”  Id. (cleaned up).  \nAccordingly, any legal risk or consequences did not flow from the letter itself, and the \nletter did not meet Bennett’s second condition for final agency action.  Id. at 1261-62.6 \na.  The First Bennett Condition \nWe turn now to the case at hand, beginning with Bennett’s first prong:  whether \nthe letter marks the consummation of NMFS’s decisionmaking process.  See Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 177-78.  The determinative question here is whether the letter “merely facilitates \nthe beginning of the [agency’s] review process for proposed agency action” or whether it \nreflects the consummation of it.  Advanced Integrative, 24 F.4th 1258 (cleaned up). \n \n6   In a second Advanced Integrative opinion, the Ninth Circuit considered whether \nthe DEA’s subsequent letter denying the medical clinic’s requests for formal \nauthorization to access a controlled substance and for immunity from prosecution was \nfinal agency action.  Advanced Integrative Med. Sci. Inst., PLLC v. DEA, 128 F.4th 1133, \n1142-43 (9th Cir. 2025).  This time around, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the letter \nconstituted final agency action.  Id.  Unlike the earlier letter, which merely provided \nguidance on the law, the new letter constituted a final decision on the clinic’s requests.  \nId. at 1142.  And it had legal consequences because it established the clinic’s “rights—or \nlack thereof—to access” the drug.  Id. at 1142-43. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 34 of 51 \nPageID.3998\nIn the letter, NMFS takes a definitive position on the commercial fishing allowed \nin the Monument Expansion.  The letter unequivocally states that “commercial fishing \nis no longer prohibited in certain areas of the” Monument.  ECF No. 14-22, at \nPageID.795.  And it goes on to say that the “federal regulations at 50 CFR §§ 665.933(a) \nand 665.934(a) implementing [President Obama’s Proclamation’s] commercial fishing \nprohibition are no longer effective between 50-200 nautical miles around Wake Island, \nJohnston Atoll, and Jarvis Island.”  Id.  This is not a tentative or equivocal stance—it is a \ndefinitive position that the existing regulations prohibiting commercial fishing in the \nExpansion area are gone, and that commercial fishing is therefore immediately \nauthorized.  Nothing about the letter suggests that the issue is still being considered, \nnor does the government represent that it is.  See Hawkes, 578 U.S. at 597.  To \ncommercial fisheries, then—at least some of whom, the record shows, acted in reliance \non NMFS’s letter—“there was probably not much about this that felt ‘merely \ntentative.’”  S.F. Herring Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 946 F.3d 564, 578 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178); see also id. at 579 (“Simply put, an agency engaging in \nmerely tentative or interlocutory thinking does not state a definitive position in formal \nnotices, confirm that position orally, and then send officers out into the field to execute \non the directive.” (cleaned up)). \nGranted, the letter is missing some of the traditional hallmarks of deliberative \nprocess.  There is no showing, for example, that the letter was preceded by agency \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 35 of 51 \nPageID.3999\nfactfinding, see Advanced Integrative, 24 F.4th at 1260 (citing Hawkes, 578 U.S. at 597), or a \npublic hearing, see id. (citing Frozen Food Express v. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 41 (1956)).  \nBut remember that the assessment of finality is not an exercise in formalisms, and while \nthese are useful reference points, they are not alone determinative—especially in a case \nsuch as this one, where Plaintiffs’ claims raise legal, not factual, issues, and rest on the \nlack of statutorily required process.  To hold that the agency’s action is unreviewable \nbecause it failed to use formal procedures, at least in these circumstances, would be to \nallow the agency to elide judicial review by doing the opposite of what is alleged to \nhave been required. \nBut, the government responds, the agency may well do what is required in the \nfuture:  the letter expressly contemplated that the promulgation of formal regulations \nwould follow.  ECF No. 23, at PageID.3767 (citing Whitman, 242 F.3d at 1101-02).  It is \ntrue that the letter states that NMFS “plan[s] to expeditiously initiate rulemaking to \nbring fishing regulations into compliance with” President Trump’s Proclamation.  ECF \nNo. 14-22, at PageID.795.  That fact could bear heavily on the finality analysis in other \ncases.  It carries little weight here, however, because the government itself characterizes \nanticipated formal rulemaking as merely “housekeeping” updates to the regulations.  \nECF No. 23, at PageID.3767.  The fact that the government believes “housekeeping” \nremains to be done does not change the fact that NMFS’s letter marked the \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 36 of 51 \nPageID.4000\nconsummation of its substantive decisionmaking.7  Instead, it tends to confirm that the \ngovernment has already made its decision, and that it views any subsequent actions as \na mere formality.  For “all practical purposes,” then, NMFS’s letter reflects a final \ndecision on commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion.  Hawkes, 578 U.S. at 598.  \nAnd once such a final decision has been made, there is final agency action; it matters not \nthat the “agency [might] need to do something similar again in the future.”  Waterkeeper \nAll., 140 F.4th at 1207.  The first of Bennett’s considerations is satisfied. \n  b.  The Second Bennett Condition \nThe remaining question on final agency action—the second Bennett prong—is \nwhether the letter determined “rights or obligations” or gave rise to “direct and \nappreciable legal consequences.”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178.  Here the government \ncontends that the letter “merely communicated that [President Trump’s] Proclamation . \n. . lifted the restriction on commercial fishing within the Monument Expansion area.”  \nECF No. 23, at PageID.3766.  And so, the government posits, as in Advanced Integrative, \nthe letter did no more than express its view of what the law—in this case, the \n \n7   Deferring judicial review until the government enacts its “housekeeping” \nregulations, moreover, would risk leaving Plaintiffs “without the possibility of judicial \nreview,” given that commercial fishing has already begun in the Monument Expansion \nin the wake of NMFS’s letter and that it remains unclear whether NMFS will \nexpeditiously—or ever—undertake notice and comment procedures to conform existing \nregulations to its current position.  Saliba v. SEC, 47 F.4th 961, 968 (9th Cir. 2022) \n(concluding that an agency decision on sanctions was final, viewed in a “pragmatic and \nflexible manner,” because a “failure to review these sanctions now could foreclose \nappellate review . . . in the future” (cleaned up)). \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 37 of 51 \nPageID.4001\nProclamation—requires; it did not have any independent legal consequences.  See 24 \nF.4th at 1259 (citing Fairbanks N. Star Borough v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 543 F.3d 586, \n594 (9th Cir. 2008)).  The flaw in the government’s position is that the Proclamation is \nmost naturally read as doing no more than directing the Secretary to engage in notice-\nand-comment rulemaking to undo the existing regulations on commercial fishing.  The \nProclamation states that “[b]etween 50 to 200 nautical miles from the landward \nboundaries of the Monument, the Secretary of Commerce shall not prohibit commercial \nfishing.”  ECF No. 14-29, at PageID.857.  And it directs the Secretary to “take \nappropriate action” to “implement” the Proclamation and to “expeditiously publish \nnew proposed rules in the Federal Register to amend or repeal all burdensome \nregulations that restrict commercial fishing”—it does not state that the regulations are \nhereby amended or repealed.  Id.   \n  Had the Proclamation instead sought to immediately repeal formal regulations \nby its own force, it could easily have said so.  That much is clear from the fact that the \nProclamation does say that it is immediately revising language in President Obama’s \n2014 proclamation.  As President Trump’s Proclamation puts it, in no uncertain terms, \n“[a]ll language under the section entitled ‘Management of the Marine Monument’ in \n[President Obama’s] Proclamation . . . is deleted and replaced with the following,” and \nit then lays out new text to replace what has been deleted.  ECF No. 14-29, at \nPageID.857.  Given that the Proclamation uses language bringing about an immediate \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 38 of 51 \nPageID.4002\nrevision in a prior proclamation, it is significant that the Proclamation does not use \ncomparable language when issuing its directives to the Secretary.  The Proclamation \ndoes not announce that existing formal regulations are “deleted.”  It is instead forward-\nlooking:  it directs the Secretary to take further action “to amend or repeal” these \nregulations.  Id. at PageID.858. \nLacking any grounding in the text of the Proclamation, the government also \npoints to the prior proclamations of President Bush and President Obama, which it says \ncarried immediate effects.  The 2009 proclamation establishing the Monument, for \nexample, directed the Secretary to “prohibit commercial fishing within boundaries of \nthe monument.”  74 Fed. Reg. at 1568.  And following that proclamation, NMFS issued \na letter to permit holders in which it took the position that President Bush’s \nproclamation had the effect of immediately prohibiting commercial fishing within the \nMonument’s boundaries.  The 2009 letter stated that “the commercial fishing \nprohibitions and other terms set out in the Presidential Proclamation[] became \nimmediately effective upon issuance of the Proclamation[] on January 6th.  Accordingly, \nall commercial fishing within the waters of the . . . marine National Monument[] . . . is \nnow prohibited.”  ECF No. 21-4, at PageID.1362 (AR at 000463).  The 2014 proclamation \nexpanding the Monument similarly directed the Secretary to “prohibit commercial \nfishing within the boundaries of the Monument Expansion.”  79 Fed. Reg. at 58647.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 39 of 51 \nPageID.4003\nEven assuming the 2009 and 2014 proclamations did have immediate effect, \nhowever, those proclamations are poor precedent for the government’s current \nposition.  That is because those prior proclamations did not purport to repeal existing \nformal regulations that had been passed through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  The \nprior proclamations, therefore, offer no support to the government’s current position \nthat President Trump’s Proclamation did just that. \nIndeed, the government has offered no case or other precedent for the \nproposition that the President could repeal formal regulations through a proclamation \nalone.  The government nonetheless asserts that this result follows from the fact that a \nPresident’s proclamation, issued under the Antiquities Act, has the force of law.  There \nis no need here to doubt that President Trump’s Proclamation, if valid, is binding law.  \nCf. Indep. Meat Packers Ass’n v. Butz, 525 F.2d 228, 234 (8th Cir. 1975) (“Presidential \nproclamations and orders have the force and effect of laws when issued pursuant to a \nstatutory mandate or delegation of authority from Congress.”).  But the government’s \nassertion begs the question of whether the President, even in creating law under the \nAntiquities Act, is required to ensure that notice and comment procedures are used to \nrepeal a formal regulation that had been promulgated using formal procedures.  See 54 \nU.S.C. § 320301 (authorizing the President to declare national monuments and reserve \nfederal lands, but not explicitly to repeal existing formal regulations without process).  \nRequiring as much would not necessarily restrict the power of the President in a broad \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 40 of 51 \nPageID.4004\nsense; it would instead enable the President to make credible commitments that an \nopportunity for notice and comment will be afforded before a formal regulation is \nrepealed.  The ability to make credible commitments is often viewed as advancing one’s \nautonomy, rather than impeding it.  Cf. Hanoch Dagan & Michael Heller, Special \nPerformance:  On Freedom and Commitment in Contract Law, 98 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1323, \n1353 (2023) (recognizing that “some degree of stability is essential for people’s plans to \nbe meaningful,” even if “plans need not be fully immune from changes”).  And so there \nis a serious question whether Congress, in granting the President impressive powers \nunder the Antiquities Act, would have meant to deprive the President of this one. \nBut here, the court need not—and therefore does not—resolve whether a \nPresidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act could lawfully repeal formal \nregulations without using notice and comment procedures.  It is sufficient to conclude \nthat President Trump’s Proclamation is best interpreted as not purporting to do so.  \nThat is, the text of the Proclamation is not fairly read as an effort to free the Secretary of \nCommerce from the burden of using notice and comment procedures to repeal the \nexisting regulatory ban.  While government counsel asserted at the hearing that this \nwas indeed the underlying “intention” of the Proclamation, only a strained reading of \nthe language of the Proclamation would support that inference.  The court cannot \nconclude that the Proclamation sought to tee up a substantial question about the \nPresident’s power under the Antiquities Act “in so cryptic a fashion.”  Food & Drug \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 41 of 51 \nPageID.4005\nAdmin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 160 (2000).  It is often said that \nCongress does not “hide elephants in mouseholes.”  Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, \n531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001).  There is no reason to conclude that a President would either. \nWhich brings us back to NMFS’s letter.  By asserting that the Proclamation \nimmediately eviscerated existing regulations prohibiting commercial fishing in the \nMonument Expansion—even though it did no such thing—the letter did not merely \ntake the plain and unremarkable step of restating or describing existing law.  It instead \nasserted a startling conclusion:  that the existing regulations promulgated via notice and \ncomment procedures were immediately eliminated by the Proclamation itself, even \nthough nothing in the Proclamation’s text supports that view, and even though the \nProclamation directed the agency to make proper use of notice and comment \nprocedures to implement its directives.  By asserting this position, NMFS’s letter created \nnew, substantive legal consequences that had not already been established by the \nProclamation.   \nThese significant legal consequences come in two forms.  First, the letter carries \nlegal consequences because it effectively announces a safe harbor for commercial \nfisheries who rely on it.  That is to say, the letter commits the agency to the position that \nthe formal regulations have already been repealed, and thus effectively reflects its \ncommitment to non-enforcement of regulations that are still on the books.  A \ncommitment to non-enforcement of that variety is sufficient to create legal \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 42 of 51 \nPageID.4006\nconsequences.  In Hawkes, for example, the court concluded that a “negative” \njurisdictional determination creates a “safe harbor” from civil enforcement proceedings \nunder the Clean Water Act because the government commits to follow that \ndetermination for five years.  578 U.S. at 598.  Here, the agency’s commitment to \nnonenforcement is even more sweeping than that discussed in Hawkes:  NMFS’s letter \ndoes not merely commit the government to not enforcing the commercial fishing \nprohibitions against permit holders in the Monument Expansion for a set amount of \ntime.  It instead takes the position that the prohibitions are gone entirely—and, hence, \nthat they could never be used against permit holders who engage in commercial fishing \nin the Monument Expansion, because there is nothing for the government to enforce. \nSecond, even apart from its announcement of a safe harbor for commercial \nfishing operations (in the form of a government commitment to non-enforcement), the \nletter carries legal consequences because it creates a possible basis for an estoppel \ndefense.  Were the government to later try to change its position and enforce the \nexisting regulations prohibiting commercial fishing (despite its having announced the \nposition that those regulations no longer exist), permit holders could credibly argue that \nthe government should be estopped from enforcing the regulations because they \nreasonably relied on the agency’s letter.  That is because “[w]hen an authorized \ngovernment official tells the defendant that a course of action is legal and the defendant \nreasonably relies to its detriment on that erroneous representation, then fairness and \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 43 of 51 \nPageID.4007\ndue process may prohibit the state from punishing the defendant for that unlawful \nconduct.”  Fairbanks, 543 F.3d at 596 n.12 (noting that an Army Corps statement that a \nproperty is not a jurisdictional wetland subject to permitting requirements under the \nClean Water Act could be the basis for an estoppel defense).8   \nIn light of these significant legal consequences, moreover, it is notable that the \nNinth Circuit has already recognized that an agency’s position on the legality of fishing, \nviewed pragmatically, has sufficient legal consequences to satisfy Bennett’s second \nprong.  In San Francisco Herring Association v. United States Department of the Interior, the \nNinth Circuit held that National Park Service orders to individual fishermen to stop \nfishing met Bennett’s second prong because there was no dispute that persons who \nengaged in commercial fishing “could be punished through fines and imprisonment.”  \n946 F.3d at 580.  That expectation of “immediate compliance” with an agency directive \nand attendant exposure to liability suffices to establish that legal consequences flow \n \n8   This is not to suggest that “legal novelty alone establishes finality.”  Valero Energy \nCorp. v. EPA, 927 F.3d 532, 537 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  An agency would not engage in final \nagency action by expressing a novel legal perspective while making clear that its view is \ntentative and “binds no one.”  Id. (noting that the agency document at issue in that case \nmade “clear that it ha[d] no binding effect on how [the agency] will conduct future \nreviews”); see also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Haaland, 58 F.4th 412, 417 (9th Cir. 2023) \n(concluding that the EPA’s adoption of a recovery plan was not final agency action \nbecause such plans merely “provide guidance” and are not treated by the agency as \n“binding authorities” (cleaned up)).  But here, the agency letter asserts a nonobvious \ninterpretation of the Proclamation—one that appears to be unsupported by the text of \nthe Proclamation and, indeed, inconsistent with it—which firmly commits the agency to \nafford a safe harbor from enforcement.  Under these circumstances, significant legal \nconsequences flow from the letter itself. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 44 of 51 \nPageID.4008\nfrom an agency action.  Id.  As Hawkes made clear, both the denial of a safe harbor and \nthe creation of one can constitute legal consequences for final agency action purposes.  \nAnd this case presents the flipside of San Francisco Herring Association—an agency has \ntied its hand, and unless the letter is set aside, commercial fisheries might reasonably \nrely on the letter to avoid liability under the existing regulations banning commercial \nfishing in the Monument Expansion.   \n  At bottom, NMFS’s letter is not “the type of workaday advice letter that agencies \nprepare countless times per year in dealing with the regulated community.”  Advanced \nIntegrative, 24 F.4th at 1260 (cleaned up).  Far from a routine correspondence, the letter \ncreates a safe harbor for commercial fishing operations:  it announces a firm agency \ncommitment to non-enforcement (through the assertion that those regulations no longer \nexist) and thus carries significant legal consequences all on its own.  A letter of that \nvariety, viewed pragmatically and flexibly, is final agency action.  The court is therefore \nsatisfied that it has the statutory authority to review the legality of the letter, and it \nturns to that issue next.   \nC.  Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking \n \nOn the merits, Plaintiffs’ contention is that NMFS’s letter was “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” or “without \nobservance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D).  In the claims at \nissue here—claims five and six of the complaint—Plaintiffs contend that NMFS’s failure \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 45 of 51 \nPageID.4009\nto engage in the legally required notice and comment procedures violated both the \nMagnuson Act and the APA. \nThe Magnuson Act was enacted “as a response to overfishing and inadequate \nconservation measures that were threatening future commercial and recreational \nfishing, as well as the survival of a number of species of fish.”  Or. Trollers Ass’n v. \nGutierrez, No. Civ. 05–6165, 2005 WL 2211084, *1 (D. Or. Sept. 8, 2005) (citing 16 U.S.C. \n§ 1801(a)).  The Act’s purposes include “to conserve and manage the fishery resources \nfound off the coasts of the United States,” “to promote domestic commercial and \nrecreational fishing under sound conservation and management principles,” and to \nprovide for “fishery management plans.”  16 U.S.C. § 1801(b)(1), (3), (4).  Rulemaking \nunder the Magnuson Act “is subject to the APA’s notice and comment provisions.”  Or. \nTrollers Ass’n, 2005 WL 2211084, *1.  In short, then, Plaintiffs contend that both the \nMagnuson Act and the APA require the same notice and comment procedures. \nThe APA embodies Congress’s judgment that “notions of fairness and informed \nadministrative decisionmaking require that agency decisions be made only after \naffording interested persons notice and an opportunity to comment.”  Paulsen v. Daniels, \n413 F.3d 999, 1004 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 316 \n(1979)).  To that end, it “requires agencies to follow certain procedures when it decides \nto issue a rule.”  Id.  Those procedures are “(1) publishing notice of the proposed rule-\nmaking in the Federal Register, 5 U.S.C. § 553(b); (2) providing a period for interested \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 46 of 51 \nPageID.4010\npersons to comment on the proposed rule, which comments will be considered by the \nagency prior to adopting the rule, id. at § 553(c); and (3) publishing the adopted rule not \nless than thirty days before its effective date, with certain exceptions that are not \napplicable here, id. at § 553(d).”  Id.  It is “antithetical to the structure and purpose of the \nAPA for an agency to implement a rule first, and then seek comment later.”  Id. at 1005. \nTo be sure, not all final agency action requires notice-and-comment rulemaking.  \nBy its own terms, the APA’s notice-and-comment requirement generally “‘does not \napply’ to ‘interpretative rules.’”  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass'n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A)).  Unlike legislative rules, interpretive rules “do not have \nthe force and effect of law.”  Id. at 97 (cleaned up).  The “critical feature of interpretive \nrules is that they are issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency’s \nconstruction of the statutes and rules which it administers.”  Id. (cleaned up).  And so \neven though the letter reflects a mistaken interpretation of the Proclamation (given that, \nas explained above, the Proclamation itself has not repealed existing regulations), and \neven though the letter has brought about significant legal consequences because of its \nlegal error (and so is subject to judicial review), the question remains whether the letter \nnonetheless could be promulgated without notice and comment procedures because it \nis merely interpretive in nature. \nAdmittedly, this determination can sometimes be a close call.  In Golden Gate \nBridge, Highway & Transportation District v. United States Department of Labor, No. 24-cv-\n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 47 of 51 \nPageID.4011\n04985, 2025 WL 371800, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2025), for example, the government \nissued a letter responding to an engineer’s request for clarification about a scaffolding \nregulation.  The district court determined the letter was merely an interpretive rule with \nno force of law, for there was no evidence that the agency was “enforcing the \nunderlying regulation any differently than it did before the issuance of the” letter, nor \nthat it had taken any action “based on the allegedly new interpretation of the \nregulation.”  Id. at *4. \nIn this case, however, the government has chosen not to defend on the merits of \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking.  It has chosen not to advance an argument that the \nletter is an interpretative rule rather than a legislative one.  The court therefore is not \nasked to make a judgment call:  the government has chosen to forfeit any argument that \nnotice and comment procedures were unnecessary.  See, e.g., Bernstein v. Virgin Am., Inc., \n365 F. Supp. 3d 980, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (explaining that a party who has a “full and \nfair opportunity to ventilate its views” on summary judgment, but chooses not to \npursue an argument, has abandoned it); Boulware v. Dunstan, 334 F. App’x 61, 62 (9th \nCir. 2009) (issue not raised in brief was forfeited).  It follows, as a consequence, that \nPlaintiffs succeed on the merits of their claims. \nD.  Remedy \nThat leaves the question of remedy.  The APA authorizes courts to “hold \nunlawful and set aside” invalid agency action.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  In the Ninth Circuit, \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 48 of 51 \nPageID.4012\nvacatur and remand is permissible and, indeed, is the presumptive remedy for agency \naction that violates the APA, Mont. Wildlife Fed’n v. Haaland, 127 F.4th 1, 50 (9th Cir. \n2025), and that is the relief Plaintiffs seek here, see ECF No. 13, at PageID.142-45. \nThat said, there has been robust judicial and academic discussion about \nwhether—the Ninth Circuit’s precedent notwithstanding—the APA truly authorizes \ndistrict courts to wholesale vacate agency action, or whether courts may only set aside \nagency action with respect to the specific plaintiffs in a suit.  In his concurrence in \nUnited States v. Texas, for example, Justice Gorsuch likened vacatur of agency actions to \nuniversal injunctions, both of which he concluded might exceed district courts’ \nauthority under the APA.  599 U.S. 670, 693-704 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He opined that to properly “set aside” an agency action under the APA \nmeans only to “disregard” it in a particular case, not to “vacate” it for every case.  Id. at \n695-96; see also Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 396-97 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, J., \nconcurring) (“Use of the ‘setting aside’ language does not seem to tell us one way or \nanother whether to nullify illegal administrative action or not to enforce it in the case \nwith the named litigants.”).  See generally Mila Sohoni, The Power to Vacate A Rule, 88 \nGeo. Wash. L. Rev. 1121 (2020).  But see Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. \nRsrv. Sys., 603 U.S. 799, 830-31 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (opining that the APA \nauthorizes vacatur of unlawful agency actions, and cataloguing decisions affirmed by \nthe Supreme Court that vacated agency actions rather than merely enjoining the \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 49 of 51 \nPageID.4013\nenforcement of rules against specific plaintiffs); Nat’l TPS All. v. Noem, 773 F. Supp. 3d \n807, 866-67 (N.D. Cal. 2025) (distinguishing between universal injunctions and vacatur \nof agency actions). \nBut as the Supreme Court observed in Trump v. CASA, Inc., even if wholesale \nvacatur is not always appropriate, there are times when it is necessary to afford \ncomplete relief to the plaintiffs in a case.  145 S. Ct. 2540, 2557 n.12 (2025) \n(acknowledging that “[t]here may be other injuries for which it is all but impossible for \ncourts to craft relief that is complete and benefits only the named plaintiffs”).  Relief for \nracially gerrymandered congressional maps, for example, falls into this boat.  Id. (citing \nShaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899 (1996)).  And there is every reason to conclude that this case \ndoes so, too:  the only way to provide complete relief (or at least the fullest relief the \ncourt can afford) for the injuries Plaintiffs assert is to vacate the letter in its entirety, so \nthat no commercial fishing operators may reasonably rely on it.   \nIn any event, the court need not resolve these questions because it is bound by \nNinth Circuit precedent that authorizes universal vacatur of unlawful agency action \nand treats it as the presumptive remedy.  The government, moreover, has decided not \nto advance any argument against Plaintiffs’ chosen equitable remedy, and it has \ntherefore forfeited any argument on this issue.  The letter is therefore vacated in the \nuniversal sense that Ninth Circuit precedent authorizes. \n \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 50 of 51 \nPageID.4014\nCONCLUSION \n  The President has concluded that appropriately managed commercial fishing \nshould be allowed within the Monument Expansion.  Persons of good faith might agree \nor disagree with the President’s conclusion. \nBut this court does not sit in judgment of the wisdom of that policy.  The only \nquestions presented here are legal ones:  whether Plaintiffs have the procedural right to \nmake the agency hear them out on the question of what restrictions are needed to \nensure that commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion is indeed appropriately \nmanaged (and to have that opportunity before commercial fishing is given the green \nlight), and whether Plaintiffs have the right to vindicate their asserted procedural right \nin court. \nFor the reasons set out above, the court has concluded that Plaintiffs have the \nright to present their legal claims in court—that is, they have Article III standing, and \nthe APA authorizes this court to exercise judicial review of their claims.  And as to \nwhether Plaintiffs’ claims are correct—whether Plaintiffs are right to contend that they \nare entitled to participate in a notice and comment procedure—the government has \nchosen to concede that they are. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on its fifth and sixth \nclaims for relief, ECF No. 13, is GRANTED, and the National Marine Fisheries Service’s \nApril 25, 2025, letter is hereby VACATED.   \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-MWJS-WRP     Document 36     Filed 08/08/25     Page 51 of 51 \nPageID.4015\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED:  August 8, 2025, at Honolulu, Hawai‘i. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCivil No. 25-00209 MWJS-WRP; Kāpa‘a, et al. v.

This case challenges President Donald J. Trump’s unlawful \nProclamation 10918 of April 17, 2025 (“Trump Proclamation”), which purports to \nstrip core protections from the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument \n(“the Monument”)1 and to open the Monument to commercial fishing. See \nProclamation 10918 of April 17, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 16,987 (Apr. 22, 2025). This \ncase also challenges actions by the Trump Administration to implement the Trump \nProclamation. \n2.  The Trump Proclamation purports to allow commercial fishing in the \nwaters from 50 to 200 nautical miles around Wake Island, Jarvis Island, and \nJohnston Atoll that President Barack H. Obama added to the Monument in 2014 \n(“Monument Expansion”). See Proclamation 9173 of September 25, 2014, 79 Fed. \nReg. 58,645 (Sept. 29, 2014) (“the 2014 Proclamation”) \n3.  President George W. Bush established the Monument in 2009. See \nProclamation 8336 of January 6, 2009, 74 Fed. Reg. 1,565 (Jan. 12, 2009) (“the \n2009 Proclamation”). To establish and expand the Monument, both Presidents \n \n1 The Monument was formerly known as the Pacific Remote Islands Marine \nNational Monument. See Proclamation 10880 of January 2, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. \n2,575 (Jan. 13, 2025). \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 3 of 83  PageID.3\nBush and Obama acted pursuant to the Antiquities Act of 1906, 54 U.S.C. §§ \n320301-03. \n \nFigure 1: 2009 Monument Creation and 2014 Monument Expansion \n(Credit: National Geographic) \n \n4.  The Monument, which lies in the Pacific Ocean to the south and west \nof the Hawaiian Islands, originally included the lands, waters, and submerged and \nemergent lands of Wake, Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands, Johnston Atoll, \nKingman Reef, and Palmyra Atoll, to lines of latitude and longitude that lie \napproximately 50 nautical miles from the islands’ mean low water lines. The \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 4 of 83  PageID.4\ndesignation provided needed protection to a wide variety of scientific and historical \ntreasures in one of the most spectacular and unique ocean ecosystems on earth.  \n5.  The 2009 Proclamation states in pertinent part: “The Secretaries of \nCommerce and the Interior shall not allow or permit any appropriation, injury, \ndestruction, or removal of any feature of this monument except as provided for by \nthis proclamation and shall prohibit commercial fishing within boundaries of the \nmonument.” (Emphasis added). \n6.  Prior to the 2009 Proclamation, Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands, \nJohnston and Palmyra Atolls, and Kingman Reef themselves had been managed as \nNational Wildlife Refuges by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \n(“USFWS”) within the Department of Interior.  \n7.  The 2009 Proclamation assigned management of the nearshore waters \nand submerged and emergent lands of the islands to the Department of the Interior. \nOn January 16, 2009, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne issued Secretarial \nOrder 3284, declaring that the areas assigned to the Department of Interior by the \n2009 Proclamation will be managed as a National Wildlife Refuge. This expanded \nthe areas managed as National Wildlife Refuges to include submerged lands out to \n12 nautical miles from the islands. \n8.  On September 27, 2014, President Barack H. Obama issued the 2014 \nProclamation, which expanded the Monument to include the waters and submerged \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 5 of 83  PageID.5\nlands of Jarvis and Wake Islands and Johnston Atoll that lie from the boundary \nestablished in the 2009 Proclamation to the seaward limit of the U.S. Exclusive \nEconomic Zone (“EEZ”) of each island (“Monument Expansion”).  \n9.  The 2014 Proclamation reserved and protected a highly pristine deep \nsea and open ocean ecosystem with unique biodiversity. The Monument Expansion \nhas more than 130 undersea mountains (called “seamounts”) that provide \nimportant opportunities for scientific exploration and study. The seamounts are \nhome to colonies of deepwater corals many thousands of years old and for species \nfound nowhere else on Earth, including species that are new to science.  \n \nFigure 2: Corals and Sponges in Monument Expansion near Jarvis Island \n(Credit: NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research) \n \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 6 of 83  PageID.6\n10.  The Monument Expansion provides vital habitat and foraging areas \nfor tunas, turtles, manta rays, sharks, seals, whales, dolphins, and seabirds, \nincluding species protected as endangered or threatened under the Endangered \nSpecies Act (“ESA”), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531 et seq. Seabirds from some of the world’s \nlargest remaining colonies have evolved with a foraging technique that depends on \nschools of tuna and other large marine predators to drive prey fish and squid to the \nsurface, where they are easily caught by the seabirds. The Monument Expansion’s \nprohibition on commercial fishing thus helps ensure seabirds’ access to food.  \n11.  The Monument Expansion’s pristine waters provide a baseline \ncomparison for important scientific research that monitors and evaluates impacts of \nglobal climate change, including benchmarking coral bleaching and ocean \nacidification. \n12.  To protect these unique and fragile resources, the 2014 Proclamation \nbans all commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion. The proclamation states \nin pertinent part: “The Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce shall not allow or \npermit any appropriation, injury, destruction, or removal of any object of the \nMonument Expansion except as provided for by this proclamation and shall \nprohibit commercial fishing within the boundaries of the Monument \nExpansion.” (Emphasis added). \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 7 of 83  PageID.7\n13.  On August 31, 2016, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell issued \nSecretarial Order 3284, Amendment 1, which, among other actions, extended the \nmanagement as units of the National Wildlife Refuge System of the lands and \nwaters of Jarvis and Wake Islands and Johnston Atoll to the limits of the U.S. EEZ, \ncorresponding to the boundary changes of the Monument Expansion. \n14.  The Trump Proclamation unlawfully seeks to reverse the 2014 \nProclamation’s ban on commercial fishing, purporting to open the Monument \nExpansion—which represents more than 80% of the Monument’s total area—to \nactivities that are incompatible with the proper care and management of the objects \nof scientific or historic interest identified in the 2014 Proclamation and protected \nby the Monument Expansion’s reservation. The Trump Proclamation deprives the \nMonument Expansion’s scientific objects of the protections they had under the \n2014 Proclamation, leaving them vulnerable to the very damage that the \nMonument reservation was designed to avoid. \n15.  Although President Trump invoked the Antiquities Act and the U.S. \nConstitution as sources of authority, neither authorizes the Trump Proclamation. \nThe Antiquities Act empowers the President to create national monuments and \nreserve federally owned or controlled lands and waters to protect objects of \nhistoric or scientific interest. It does not give the President the opposite power to \nrevoke those protections. Congress retained that latter power for itself. The Trump \n  6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 8 of 83  PageID.8\nProclamation is without statutory or constitutional authority and is therefore \nunlawful. \n16.  This case also challenges the actions of the Secretaries of Commerce \nand of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n(“NOAA”), and NOAA Fisheries (more commonly known as the National Marine \nFisheries Service (“NMFS”)) (collectively, “Agency Defendants”) to carry out the \nTrump Proclamation’s illegal directives. On April 25, 2025, NMFS sent a letter to \nfishing permit holders that purported to open the Monument Expansion to \ncommercial fishing immediately, notwithstanding that federal regulations \nimplementing the 2014 Proclamation’s commercial fishing ban remain on the \nbooks. NMFS failed to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking to revise the \nregulations and open the Monument Expansion to commercial fishing, in violation \nof the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n(“Magnuson-Stevens Act”), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1801 et seq., and the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.  \n17.  Before making its decision regarding the types of commercial fishing \nthat it would allow in the Monument Expansion and under what conditions, NMFS \nfailed to comply with its mandatory duty under the National Environmental Policy \nAct (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq., to take a hard look at the environmental \nimpacts of its proposed course of action and to consider reasonable alternatives \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 9 of 83  PageID.9\nthat might have fewer adverse impacts. NMFS also violated its mandatory duty \nunder the ESA to reinitiate consultation to ensure that its proposed course of action \nwould not jeopardize the continued existence of any of the endangered or \nthreatened species found in the Monument Expansion. \n18.  NMFS’s failure to comply with NEPA and the ESA violated its duty \nunder the Magnuson-Stevens Act to ensure that all actions to regulate commercial \nfishing—whether denominated as a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or \nimplementing regulation—comply with applicable law. Assuming for the sake of \nargument that the Trump Proclamation is valid, NMFS’s actions purporting to \nimplement it were contrary to the proclamation’s directives, further violating the \nagency’s duty to ensure compliance with applicable law. \n19.  This Court should declare the Trump Proclamation to be unlawful and \nhold unlawful and set aside NMFS’s actions to implement the proclamation’s \ndirectives. The Court should further enjoin Agency Defendants from implementing \nthe Trump Proclamation and from taking any action inconsistent with the 2014 \nProclamation. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n20.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 (federal question jurisdiction); 28 U.S.C. § 1361 (actions to compel officers \nof the United States to perform their duty); 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 (power to \n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 10 of 83  PageID.10\nissue declaratory judgments in cases of actual controversy); 16 U.S.C. §§ 1855(f), \n1861(d) (actions under the Magnuson-Stevens Act); and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 \n(actions under the APA).  \n21.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act provides that fishing regulations \npromulgated by the Secretary of Commerce under the statute and actions that the \nSecretary of Commerce takes under regulations which implement a fishery \nmanagement plan shall be subject to judicial review “if a petition for such review \nis filed within 30 days after the date on which the regulations are promulgated or \nthe action is published in the Federal Register, as applicable.” 16 U.S.C. § 1855(f). \nNMFS sent its letter to fishing permit holders, purporting to change the regulations \nthat govern fishing in the Monument without notice-and-comment rulemaking and \nto open the Monument Expansion to commercial fishing immediately, on April 25, \n2025. In case 16 U.S.C. § 1855(f) applies, Plaintiffs are filing this complaint within \nthirty (30) days of NMFS’s issuance of its letter. \n22.  This Court has the authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, and may also grant relief \npursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1855(f) and 1861(d), as well \nas the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n23.

Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), because \none or more plaintiffs reside in this district, and this is a civil action in which \nofficers or employees of the United States or an agency thereof are acting in their \nofficial capacity or under color of legal authority and a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this judicial district.  \n \nPARTIES \n25.  Plaintiff Kāpa‘a is a hui, or unincorporated association, of Native \nHawaiian cultural practitioners, the members of which reside in Hawai‘i. Kāpaʻa \nwas formed to support the creation, protection, and expansion of marine national \nmonuments in the Central Pacific, including the Monument, and to oppose efforts \nto remove protections from these monuments.  \n26.  Kāpaʻa members include Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners who \nhave studied and worked to protect islands, atolls, reefs and marine waters in and \naround the Polynesian archipelago, from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to the \nSouth Pacific, including the offshore waters within the Monument Expansion. \nKāpa‘a members derive cultural, spiritual, religious, educational, subsistence, \nrecreational, and aesthetic benefits from those activities. Kāpa‘a members also \nhave cultural and familial ties to the Monument and have plans to visit the \nMonument, including but not limited to Jarvis Island, in the near future to deepen \nthese ties and study, work, recreate, and exercise their culture. As discussed below, \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 12 of 83  PageID.12\nthe Trump Proclamation and NMFS’s action to open the Monument Expansion to \ncommercial fishing harm Kāpa‘a’s members’ use and enjoyment of the Monument \nand will continue to do so as long as commercial fishing in the Monument \nExpansion is permitted. \n27.  Kāpa‘a members firmly believe that the islands within the Monument \nare part of Moananuiākea, a term used to describe the Pacific Ocean that connects \nthe indigenous peoples of the Pacific to one another. Kāpa‘a members are Native \nHawaiians who are connected genealogically to the indigenous peoples of the \nPacific through a common voyaging heritage and a common cosmology via their \noral histories and through the Kumulipo, the Native Hawaiian creation story.  \nThrough the Kumulipo and the belief that indigenous peoples are connected \nthrough Moananuiākea, members of Kāpaʻa have close ties to islands within the \nMonument arising out of their heritage and their past, present, and future use of \nthese islands—including the islands’ nearshore and deep-sea ecosystems—for \nactivities that are necessary to support and perpetuate their cultural heritage. \n28.  At least one Kāpa‘a member has advocated for over a decade to \nuphold and expand the protections of the Monument by serving as a cultural expert \non the Pacific Remote Islands community group, assembled by the federal \ngovernment to create a management plan for the islands within the Monument. \nThrough this member, Kāpa‘a has communicated with state and federal \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 13 of 83  PageID.13\nadministrative agencies and Hawai‘i congressional delegation members about the \nmanagement, proper care, and effective stewardship of the Monument by \ncontributing important cultural perspectives and practices regarding marine \nresource management. \n29.  Members of Kāpaʻa plan to use the lands and waters within the \nMonument for cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, recreational, educational, \nand aesthetic activities, including, but not limited to, voyaging canoe wayfaring, \ncollecting natural materials used in traditional Native Hawaiian cultural practices, \nsubsistence fishing, religious rituals and spiritual practices, and monitoring \nspawning seasons and distributions of marine species.  \n30.  One Kāpaʻa member also has a deep personal connection to the \nislands within the Monument. This member’s uncle was part of Hui Panalā‘au, a \ngroup of Native Hawaiian civilians who were sent to the islands of Howland, \nBaker, and Jarvis in 1935 to 1942 to occupy these lands as colonizers for the \nUnited States. Hui Panalā‘au established a colony on these islands and survived by \nliving off the land. They also recorded weather conditions, cultivated plants, \nobserved and recorded marine and bird life, and collected specimens for the Bishop \nMuseum on O‘ahu. This member’s uncle was ultimately killed on Howland Island \nafter succumbing to injuries sustained in the Japanese bombing of Howland, Baker, \nand Jarvis Islands on December 8, 1941.  \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 14 of 83  PageID.14\n31.  Kāpaʻa members have planned a voyage to the islands of Howland \nand Jarvis that will take place sometime during the period from the winter of 2025 \nto spring of 2026. At least one Kāpa‘a member will participate in this voyage. A \nreturn to these islands is an important acknowledgement of Kāpa‘a members’ \nancestors who spent time there and will allow Kāpa‘a members to deepen their \ncultural connection to these places. This voyage will provide important traditional \nnavigation education and experience and allow Kāpa‘a members to kilo (observe \nand assess) culturally and ecologically significant marine resources on their \njourney, to engage in cultural protocol and spiritual ceremony, and to participate in \nother recreational and aesthetic activities such as viewing and observing marine \nwildlife in their unspoiled natural habitat.  \n32.  The Trump Proclamation and NMFS’s action to allow commercial \nfishing in the Monument Expansion adversely affects Kāpa‘a’s cultural, spiritual, \nreligious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests in having \nthe opportunity to experience these culturally significant and pristine protected \nareas, and their abundant wildlife and intact ecosystems.  \n33.  Most immediately, commercial fishing will make Kāpa‘a members’ \nupcoming voyage less culturally fulfilling by disturbing the natural, intact marine \necosystems in the Monument Expansion around Jarvis Island and preventing \nmembers from experiencing traditional navigation throughways undisturbed by \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 15 of 83  PageID.15\ncommercial activities. Upsetting the pristine marine ecosystems in the waters \naround Jarvis Island will also injure Kāpa‘a’s educational, recreational, and \naesthetic interests by preventing members from observing, studying, recording, and \ndocumenting marine species in their natural habitats, unaffected by commercial \nactivity. \n34.  The practice of commercial fishing and the unavoidable and \nsignificant waste of marine resources caused by commercial fishing bycatch is an \naffront to Kāpa‘a members’ cultural, spiritual, religious and subsistence-based \nbeliefs. Expanding commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion to these areas \nprioritizes short-term gain over making the resource protection investments \nrequired to ensure abundant food from the sea for our children and our children’s \nchildren. Allowing unsustainable commercial fishing practices in the Monument \nExpansion, particularly with respect to bycatch, will waste significant amounts of \nvaluable resources, harm marine ecosystems, and upset the necessary balance of \nthe ocean. Allowing commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion thus poses an \nexistential threat to the cultural practices of ‘āina momona (i.e., setting aside areas \nfor resources to rest and replenish so future generations can thrive) and aloha ‘āina \n(i.e., love for the land) that are central to Kāpa‘a members’ cultural, spiritual, \nreligious, and subsistence-based beliefs. \n  14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 16 of 83  PageID.16\n35.  Plaintiff Conservation Council for Hawai‘i (“CCH”) is a non-profit \ncitizens’ organization based in Hawai‘i with approximately 4,000 members in \nHawai‘i, the United States, and foreign countries. CCH is the Hawai’i affiliate of \nthe National Wildlife Federation, a non-profit membership organization with over \n5.8 million members and supporters nationwide.  \n36.  CCH’s mission is to protect Hawai‘i’s ecosystems and native wildlife, \nincluding threatened and endangered species, and to restore the ecosystems on \nwhich those species depend for future generations. The wildlife species that CCH \nhas worked to protect include species of tunas, sharks, rays, whales, dolphins, \nseals, seabirds, sea turtles, and corals that will be harmed by allowing commercial \nfishing within the Monument. CCH’s activities to protect these species include \ntestifying at the state legislature on various bills relating to the protection of the \nenvironment, testifying before administrative agencies on proposed regulations \nrelating to species conservation, communicating with Hawai‘i’s congressional \ndelegation and staff, reviewing and commenting on environmental documents, \nsupporting scientific studies and research, engaging in field work to survey \nHawai‘i’s natural resources, participating in service projects to protect native \nspecies and ecosystems, and preparing educational materials.  \n  15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 17 of 83  PageID.17\n37.  CCH has been involved in numerous efforts to create, expand, and \nprotect national monuments in the Pacific region, including the efforts to establish \nthe Monument in 2009 and to expand it in 2014.  \n38.  CCH members include marine biologists and Native Hawaiian \ncultural practitioners who have visited, studied, worked, and recreated in areas \nwithin the Monument and derive recreational, professional, scientific, educational, \nand aesthetic benefits from those activities. CCH members’ use and enjoyment of \nthe Monument for these purposes will be harmed by commercial fishing in the \nMonument Expansion.  \n39.  For example, one of CCH’s members has conducted extensive \nscientific research within the Monument for more than two decades. This member \nhas personally participated in numerous scientific research trips to all islands \nwithin the Monument.  \n40.  Wake Island, Jarvis Island, and Johnston Atoll have distinct, \nunparalleled ecological indicators for fish biomass, coral cover, and microbes, and \nare located along the equator, directly in line with wind and current patterns that \ncan lead to thermal events. Because of their geographic location and pristine \nenvironments, these islands provide unique laboratories for CCH’s member and \nother scientists to study how coral reefs respond to and recover from thermal \nevents. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 18 of 83  PageID.18\n41.  CCH’s member has been to Wake Island twice and has plans to visit \nagain sometime during the next two years to collect data and imagery on coral \nreefs and build upon his research team’s prior data collection efforts on Wake. The \nmember will also continue his research on the imperiled bumphead parrotfish. \nWake Island is home to the largest population of bumphead parrotfish in the \nUnited States, and one of the largest populations in the world, due to island’s \nprotected status within the Monument and its expansive sheltered lagoon. The \nmember’s research will be undermined by commercial fishing in the offshore areas \naround Wake. Allowing commercial fishing closer to shore will increase threats to \nthe bumphead parrotfish and their habitats from derelict fishing gear. The resulting \ndecline in bumphead parrotfish will make it difficult for the member to study an \nintact population of bumphead parrotfish, which is essential for his research.  \n42.  This member has also participated in research trips to Jarvis Island in \n2001, 2002, and 2010, and is returning to Jarvis for another research trip no later \nthan 2030. Because commercial fishing has (until now) been banned in the full \nexclusive economic zone around Jarvis since 2014, it is the only location in the \nUnited States where the member can study a pristine marine ecosystem’s ability to \nrecover from a recent, largescale coral mortality event. Resuming commercial \nfishing in the offshore waters around Jarvis would undermine the member’s ability \nto achieve his research objectives, further injuring his professional interests.  \n  17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 19 of 83  PageID.19\n43.  Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity (“the Center”) is a non-profit \nenvironmental organization founded in 1989 and dedicated to the protection of \nnative, threatened and endangered species and their habitats through science, \npolicy, and environmental law. The Center is incorporated in California and \nheadquartered in Tucson, Arizona, with field offices throughout the United States \nand Mexico, including in Honolulu, Hawai‘i. The Center has over 90,000 \nmembers, including members in Hawai‘i and American Samoa dedicated to the \nprotection and restoration of imperiled species and wild places.  \n44.  The Center and its members are concerned with the conservation of \nmarine ecosystems and imperiled species, including ones that will be adversely \naffected by the Trump Proclamation and NMFS’s action to allow commercial \nfishing within the Monument Expansion. The Center has been involved in \nnumerous efforts to create, expand, and protect national monuments on land and \nsea, including the efforts to establish and expand the Monument in 2009 and 2014, \nrespectively. The Center has also been involved in many lawsuits and campaigns to \nprotect the wildlife that will be harmed by allowing commercial fishing within the \nMonument, including tunas, sharks, rays, whales, dolphins, seals, seabirds, sea \nturtles, and corals.  \n45.  Members of the Center have visited, studied, worked, and recreated in \nareas within the Monument and derive recreational, professional, scientific, \n  18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 20 of 83  PageID.20\neducational, and aesthetic benefits from those activities. For example, one of the \nCenter’s members has been conducting scientific research within the Monument \nfor more than twenty years. This member and his research team have, collectively, \nvisited all islands within the Monument, many on multiple occasions, to carry out \ntheir research.  \n46.  As part of his research, this member participated in a research trip to \nJarvis Island in 2010, other members of the research team visited Jarvis in 2017 \nand 2018, and the member is returning to Jarvis for a follow-up research trip in the \nnear future, no later than 2030. Jarvis is the only place in the United States where \nthe member can conduct aspects of his research, in part because of the island’s \nprotected status prohibiting commercial fishing in the full exclusive economic zone \naround Jarvis since 2014.  \n47.  This member also plans to visit Wake Island no later than 2028 to \ncollect data and imagery on coral reefs and build upon the research team’s prior \ndata collection efforts on Wake. As with Jarvis Island, opening the 50 to 200 \nnautical mile zone around Wake to commercial fishing will harm the member’s \nability to study remote marine ecosystems by adding a substantial variable that \nharms the pristine condition of the marine waters surrounding the island.  \n48.  During his upcoming research trip to Wake, this member will also \ncollect data on the effectiveness of recent rodent eradication efforts. Rodents on \n  19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 21 of 83  PageID.21\nWake were killing wildlife including imperiled seabirds, which reduced guano \n(bird excrement) and the supply of important nutrients to the land and nearshore \nmarine ecosystem. Opening the offshore areas around Wake to commercial fishing \nwill undermine efforts to revive seabird populations on Wake by removing \noffshore foraging areas for seabirds, subjecting seabirds to bycatch from \ncommercial fishing, and changing the behavior of pelagic fish schools (e.g., tunas) \non which seabirds rely to chase prey fish to the ocean surface. Without court \nintervention to stop commercial fishing in the pelagic waters around Wake, seabird \npopulations will suffer challenges to feeding in critical, offshore foraging habitats, \nhindering the member’s ability to assess impacts of island restoration efforts on \nseabird populations and knock-on effects on coral reef ecosystem health. \n49.  Resuming commercial fishing in the offshore waters around Jarvis \nand Wake would undermine research being conducted by members of both CCH \nand the Center, injuring their professional interests. Prompt action to stop \ncommercial fishing in the pelagic waters around Jarvis and Wake is necessary to \nsalvage these ongoing and future research efforts and prevent further professional \ninjury. These members will also suffer aesthetic and recreational injury on future \ntrips to these islands by being deprived of the opportunity to experience some of \nthe last remaining wild and healthy ocean ecosystems on Earth, and the abundant \nwildlife and megafauna within them.    \n  20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 22 of 83  PageID.22\n50.  Kāpa‘a, CCH, and the Center (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), as well as \ntheir individual members, also suffer procedural injury from NMFS’s April 25, \n2025 letter informing commercial fishing permit holders that, effective \nimmediately, “commercial fishing is no longer prohibited” in the Monument \nExpansion. By skipping over the rulemaking process and the related environmental \nreview processes, Plaintiffs and their members were deprived of the opportunity to \nprovide input to inform and improve NMFS’s decision-making process. Plaintiffs’ \nprocedural injury “is tied to a substantive ‘harm to the environment,’” which \n“consists of added risk to the environment that takes place when governmental \ndecisionmakers make up their minds without having before them an analysis (with \npublic comment) of the likely effects of their decision on the environment.” \nCitizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, 971 (9th Cir. \n2003) (citation omitted; emphasis added).  \n51.  The above-described scientific, professional, educational, recreational, \ncultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, aesthetic, and procedural interests of \nPlaintiffs and their respective members have been, are being, and, unless the relief \nprayed herein is granted, will continue to be adversely affected and irreparably \ninjured by Defendants’ unlawful actions. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of \nthemselves and their adversely affected members. \n  21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 23 of 83  PageID.23\n52.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is sued in his official capacity as \nPresident of the United States.  \n53.  Defendant Howard Lutnick is sued in his official capacity as the \nSecretary of Commerce. In that capacity, Secretary Lutnick is responsible for \nensuring that the Department of Commerce and its constituent agencies, including \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”), comply with \napplicable law, including the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NEPA, the ESA, the APA, \nand the 2014 Proclamation’s directives and requirements for managing the \nMonument Expansion, including the ban on commercial fishing. \n54.  Defendant Laura Grimm is sued in her official capacity as Acting \nAdministrator of NOAA within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The \nAdministrator of NOAA (currently, Ms. Grimm) is responsible for ensuring that \nNOAA and its constituent offices, including NMFS, comply with applicable law, \nincluding the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NEPA, the ESA, the APA, and the 2014 \nProclamation’s directives and requirements for managing the Monument \nExpansion, including the ban on commercial fishing. \n55.  Defendant Eugenio Piñeiro Soler is sued in his official capacity as \nAssistant Administrator for NOAA Fisheries (more commonly known as the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service), which is an office of NOAA within the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce. In that capacity, Assistant Administrator Soler is \n  22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 24 of 83  PageID.24\nresponsible for ensuring that NMFS complies with applicable law, including the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act, NEPA, the ESA, the APA, and the 2014 Proclamation’s \ndirectives and requirements for managing the Monument Expansion, including the \nban on commercial fishing \n56.  Defendant Doug Burgum is sued in his official capacity as the \nSecretary of the Interior of the United States. In that capacity, Secretary Burgum is \nresponsible for ensuring that the Department of the Interior and its constituent \nagencies, including USFWS, comply with applicable law, including the 2014 \nProclamation’s directives and requirements for managing the Monument \nExpansion, including the ban on commercial fishing. \n57.  Defendants have the authority, ability, and obligation to remedy the \nharms alleged to Plaintiffs’ interests. \n \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \nThe Antiquities Act \n \n58.  The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the exclusive “power to dispose \nof and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other \nProperty belonging to the United States.” U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (the \nProperty Clause). Exercising this power, Congress may buy, sell, or withdraw \nfederal public lands, including submerged lands and associated waters under \nfederal control, or manage them and prescribe limitations on their use. The \n  23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 25 of 83  PageID.25\nConstitution also gives Congress the exclusive power “[t]o regulate Commerce \nwith foreign Nations, and among the several states.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3 \n(the Commerce Clause). \n59.  In 1906, Congress delegated a part of its Property Clause power to the \nPresident when it enacted the Antiquities Act, now codified at 54 U.S.C. § 320301 \net seq. The Antiquities Act authorizes the President to “declare by public \nproclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other \nobjects of historic or scientific interest that are situated on land owned or \ncontrolled by the Federal Government to be national monuments,” id. § 320301(a), \nand to “reserve parcels of land as a part of the national monuments” that comprise \nthe smallest area “compatible with the proper care and management of the objects \nto be protected,” id. § 320301(b).  \n60.  Beginning with Theodore Roosevelt, eighteen Presidents have \nexercised Congress’ express delegation of authority under the Antiquities Act to \ndesignate or expand by proclamation 168 national monuments throughout the \nnation to protect landscapes of extraordinary beauty, as well as irreplaceable and \nexceptional objects and sites of scientific and historical importance. National \nmonuments have been designated in 36 states as well as in the District of \nColumbia, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana \nIslands. Depending on the nature and location of the objects to be protected, \n  24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 26 of 83  PageID.26\nnational monument designations have ranged from just a few acres to millions of \nacres in size. They include American icons like the Statue of Liberty in New York, \nMuir Woods in California, Canyon de Chelly in Arizona, and Misty Fjords in \nAlaska. Many national parks, including Grand Canyon and Zion, began as national \nmonuments. In the 119 years since its enactment, the Antiquities Act has provided \nlasting and valuable protection to the nation’s cultural, natural, and historical \nheritage.  \n61.  A President’s national monument designation confers enhanced \nprotection for the identified “objects of scientific and historic interest” and for the \nlands or waters that comprise them or on which they are found. 54 U.S.C. § \n320301(a). Once designated as a national monument, those lands and waters must \nbe managed for the purpose of preserving and safeguarding their scientific and \nhistorical interest, or the objects of such interest located there.  \n62.  When designating a national monument, the President may “reserve” \nfederally owned or controlled lands and waters as part of the monument and, as \npart of that reservation, may impose specific use restrictions that are necessary for \nthe “proper care and management of the objects to be protected.” 54 U.S.C. § \n320301(b). For example, to ensure that objects of scientific interest are effectively \nprotected, many Presidents have used their Antiquities Act authority to prohibit \ncommercial extractive industries such as commercial fishing—as President Bush \n  25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 27 of 83  PageID.27\ndid in the 2009 Proclamation establishing Pacific Remote Islands Marine National \nMonument, and as President Obama did in the 2014 Proclamation, establishing the \nMonument Expansion. \n63.  In a national monument, lands and waters are managed to protect the \nidentified objects of historical or scientific interest. Conferring monument status, \ntherefore, improves protections for fragile or vulnerable areas or items of historical \nand scientific interest. \n64.  In the Antiquities Act, Congress granted the President limited \nauthority to “declare . . . national monuments,” 54 U.S.C. § 320301(a) (emphasis \nadded), and to “reserve” federal lands and waters to ensure “proper care and \nmanagement of the objects to be protected,” id. § 320301(b) (emphasis added). \nCongress did not authorize the President to abolish national monuments, in whole \nor in part, once they have been designated, nor did it authorize the President to \nundo the reservations established by prior Antiquities Act proclamations. Only \nCongress has those powers. \n \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n65.  In response to concerns about overfishing, Congress enacted the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act to promote the long-term biological and economic \nsustainability of marine fisheries in U.S. federal waters. See 16 U.S.C. § 1801(b). \nThe statute creates eight regional Fishery Management Councils (“Councils”) and \n  26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 28 of 83  PageID.28\nrequires them to develop “management plans” for all fisheries under their authority \nthat require conservation and management, amendments to such plans, and \nproposed implementing regulations, which NMFS may approve, partially approve, \nor reject. Id. §§ 1801(b)(4)-(5), 1852(h)(1), 1853, 1854(a)(3) & (b)(1). The \nfisheries at issue in this case fall under the authority of the Western Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council. Id. § 1852(a)(1)(H). \n66.  NMFS may approve a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or \nproposed regulation only if it is consistent with “applicable law,” including the \nESA and NEPA. Id. § 1854(a)(1)(A), (b)(1); see also id. §§ 1853(a)(1)(C), \n1854(a)(3). \n67.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act mandates opportunities for interested \nmembers of the public to review every proposed fishery management plan, plan \namendment, and implementing regulation and to provide input to inform decision-\nmaking.  \n68.  Councils must “conduct public hearings … so as to allow all \ninterested persons an opportunity to be heard in the development of fishery \nmanagement plans and amendments to such plans, and with respect to the \nadministration and implementation of the provisions of [the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct].” Id. § 1852(h)(3); see also id. § 1852(i)(2)(D) (guaranteeing the right of \n  27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 29 of 83  PageID.29\ninterested persons “to present oral or written statements regarding the matters on \nthe [Council’s] agenda at meetings”). \n69.   Upon the transmittal from a Council of a fishery management plan or \nplan amendment, NMFS must “[i]mmediately publish in the Federal Register a \nnotice stating that the plan or amendment is available and that written information, \nviews, or comments of interested persons on the plan or amendment may be \nsubmitted to the Secretary during the 60-day period beginning on the date the \nnotice is published.” Id. § 1854(a)(1)(B). In its review of the plan or amendment, \nNMFS must then “take into account the information, views, and comments \nreceived from interested persons.” Id. § 1854(a)(2)(A). \n70.  In circumstances where NMFS is authorized to develop its own \nfishery management plans or plan amendments, id. § 1854(c)(1), the Magnuson-\nStevens Act guarantees identical opportunities for public input and also mandates \nthat NMFS consider public comments before making its decision whether to adopt \nthe plan or amendment. Id. § 1854(c)(2)(A), (4)(B), (5). \n71.  Before NMFS adopts a Council’s proposed regulation implementing a \nfishery management plan or plan amendment, NMFS must publish the proposed \nregulation in the Federal Register “for a public comment period of 15 to 60 days.” \nId. § 1854(b)(1)(A). Where NMFS proposes a regulation to implement a plan or \namendment that it prepared, NMFS also must publish notice of the proposed \n  28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 30 of 83  PageID.30\nregulation in the Federal Register and provide a comment period, generally of 60 \ndays. Id. § 1854(c)(6). \n72.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act places on NMFS the “general \nresponsibility to carry out any fishery management plan or amendment” that it \n“approved or prepared.” Id. § 1855(d). NMFS is authorized to promulgate such \nregulations … as may be necessary to discharge such responsibility or to carry out \nany other provision of [the statute]. Id. When acting under this authority, NMFS \nmust promulgate its regulations “in accordance with section 553 of title 5,” id., \nwhich requires notice-and-comment rulemaking and guarantees that interested \npersons will have “an opportunity to participate in the rule making through \nsubmission of written data, views, or arguments.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(c). \n73.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act provides for judicial review of regulations \npromulgated by NMFS under the statute and actions taken under regulations that \nimplement a fishery management plan. 16 U.S.C. § 1855(f). The court is \nauthorized to “set aside any such regulation or action on a ground specified in [5 \nU.S.C.] section 706(2)(A), (B), (C), or (D).” Id. § 1855(f)(2). \n \nAdministrative Procedure Act \n74.  The APA sets forth the procedures by which federal agencies are \naccountable to the public and their actions are subject to judicial review.  \n  29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 31 of 83  PageID.31\n75.  Among other things, the APA defines the procedures that agencies \nmust follow for “rule making,” defined as the process of “formulating, amending, \nor repealing a rule.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(5). “Rule,” in turn, is defined broadly to \ninclude “an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect \n[that is] designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.” Id. § 551(4). \n76.  Section 4 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553, prescribes a three-step \nprocedure for what is known as “notice-and-comment rulemaking.” First, the \nagency must issue a “[g]eneral notice of proposed rule making,” ordinarily by \npublication in the Federal Register. Id. § 553(b). Second, if “notice [is] required,” \nthe agency must “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule \nmaking through submission of written data, views, or arguments.” Id. § 553(c). \nThird, when the agency promulgates the final rule, it must include in the rule’s text \n“a concise general statement of [its] basis and purpose.” Id.  \n77.  Rules issued through the notice-and-comment process are often \nreferred to as “legislative rules” because they have the “force and effect of law.” \nChrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302-03 (1979) (cleaned up). \n78.  The APA recognizes only two exceptions to the requirement for \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking. Unless another statute states otherwise, the \nnotice-and-comment requirement “does not apply” to (1) “interpretative rules, \ngeneral statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or \n  30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 32 of 83  PageID.32\npractice” or (2) “when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the \nfinding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and \npublic procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A)-(B).  \n79.  The APA provides for judicial review of “final agency action for \nwhich there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704. “[T]wo conditions \nmust be satisfied” for agency action to be “final.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n177 (1997). “First, the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process—it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory \nnature.” Id. at 177-78 (citation omitted). “[S]econd, the action must be one by \nwhich rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal \nconsequences will flow.” Id. at 178 (citation omitted). \n80.  The APA empowers a reviewing court to “compel agency action \nunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” Id. § 706(1). \n81.  A reviewing court also has the authority to “hold unlawful and set \naside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be,” among other things, \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw;” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;” “in excess \nof statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right;” and \n“without observance of procedure required by law.” Id. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n  31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 33 of 83  PageID.33\nNational Environmental Policy Act \n82.  Congress enacted the NEPA to “encourage productive and enjoyable \nharmony between man and his environment; to promote efforts which will prevent \nor eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and \nwelfare of man; [and] to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and \nnatural resources important to the Nation.”  42 U.S.C. § 4321. Congress affirmed \n“the continuing responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable \nmeans” to, among other things, “fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as \ntrustee of the environment for succeeding generations” and “preserve important \nhistoric, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage.” Id. § 4331(b)(1), \n(4). \n83.  To accomplish Congress’s goals, NEPA generally requires every \nfederal agency, including NMFS, to consider fully and disclose in a “detailed \nstatement” the environmental consequences of proposed agency action and an \nevaluation of a reasonable range of alternate ways to accomplish the agency’s \ngoals before the agency makes its decision whether to proceed with that action. Id. \n§ 4332(2)(C). “Prior to making any detailed statement,” the head of the agency \npreparing it must “consult with and obtain the comments of any Federal agency \nwhich has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any \nenvironmental impact involved.” Id. An agency must “ensure the professional \n  32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 34 of 83  PageID.34\nintegrity, including scientific integrity, of the discussion and analysis in [its] \nenvironmental document,” id. § 4332(2)(D), and must “make use of reliable data \nand resources.” Id. § 4332(2)(E).  \n84.  “Simply by focusing the agency’s attention on the environmental \nconsequences of a proposed project, NEPA ensures that important effects will not \nbe overlooked or underestimated only to be discovered after resources have been \ncommitted or the die otherwise cast.” Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens \nCouncil, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989). \n85.  Except in limited situations, an agency must prepare a NEPA analysis \nfor all “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). NEPA defines “major Federal action” as \n“an action that the agency carrying out such action determines is subject to \nsubstantial Federal control and responsibility.” Id. § 4336e(10)(A). \n86.  NEPA requires agencies to make a threshold determination whether \nan “environmental document with respect to a proposed agency action” is required. \nId. § 4336(a). The only circumstances under which an agency need not prepare a \nNEPA analysis are when: \n(1)   the proposed agency action is not a final agency action within the \nmeaning of [the APA]; \n \n(2)   the proposed agency action is excluded pursuant to one of the \nagency’s categorical exclusions, another agency’s categorical \n  33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 35 of 83  PageID.35\nexclusions [that the agency has adopted through NEPA’s established \nprocess], or another provision of law; \n \n(3)   the preparation of such document would clearly and fundamentally \nconflict with the requirements of another provision of law; or \n \n(4)   the proposed agency action is a nondiscretionary action with respect \nto which such agency does not have authority to take environmental \nfactors into consideration in determining whether to take the proposed \naction. \n \nId.; see also id. § 4336c. \n \n87.  “The term ‘categorical exclusion’ means a category of actions that a \nFederal agency has determined normally does not significantly affect the quality of \nthe human environment.” Id. § 4336e(1). \n88.  In all cases where these limited exclusions do not apply, an agency \nmust prepare either an EIS or an environmental assessment (“EA”). Id. § 4336(b).  \n89.  An agency must prepare an EIS for every “proposed agency action … \nthat has a reasonably foreseeable significant effect on the quality of the human \nenvironment.” Id. § 4336(b)(1). In preparing its EIS, the agency must request \n“public comment on alternatives or impacts and on relevant information, studies, \nor analyses with respect to the proposed agency action.” Id. § 4336a(c). \n90.  An agency must prepare an EA for every proposed agency action \n“that does not have a reasonably foreseeable significant effect on the quality of the \nhuman environment, or if the significance of such effect is unknown.” Id. § \n4336(b)(2). The EA is “a concise public document” that “set[s] forth the basis of \n  34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 36 of 83  PageID.36\n[the] agency’s finding of no significant impact,” which warrants preparation of \nonly an EA, or the agency’s “determination that an environmental impact \nstatement is necessary.” Id.; see also id. § 4336e(7). \n \nEndangered Species Act \n91.  “[T]he Endangered Species Act of 1973 represented the most \ncomprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted \nby any nation.” Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 180 (1978) \n(hereinafter TVA). In furtherance of the ESA’s goals to conserve species and the \necosystems on which they depend, Congress mandated that “all Federal \ndepartments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened \nspecies.” Id. (quoting 16 U.S.C. § 1531(c)(1)) (emphasis omitted). The ESA \ndefines “conserve” as “to use … all methods and procedures which are necessary \nto bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the \nmeasures provided pursuant to this chapter are no longer necessary.” 16 U.S.C. § \n1532(3). “The plain intent of Congress in enacting [the ESA] was to halt and \nreverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost.” TVA, 437 U.S. at \n184. \n92.  Under the ESA, a species is listed as “endangered” where it is “in \ndanger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range,” 16 U.S.C. \n§ 1532(6), and listed as “threatened” where it is “likely to become an endangered \n  35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 37 of 83  PageID.37\nspecies within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its \nrange,” id. § 1532(20); see also id. § 1533.   \n93.  Section 7(a)(2), 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2), is a critical component of the \nESA’s statutory and regulatory scheme to conserve endangered and threatened \nspecies. Section 7(a)(2) requires each federal agency, in consultation with NMFS \nor USFWS (depending on the species involved), to “insure that any action \nauthorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the \ncontinued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.” Id.  \n94.  Agency “action” broadly includes “all activities or programs of any \nkind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in \nthe United States or upon the high seas.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.02. Such actions include \n“the promulgation of regulations” and “the granting of licenses” and “permits,” as \nwell as “actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or \nair.” Id.  \n95.  “Jeopardize the continued existence of” is defined as engaging in an \naction that “reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce \nappreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed species in \nthe wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of that species.” Id. \n96.  Section 7(a)(2) requires, among other things, that every federal \nagency must determine whether its actions “may affect” any endangered or \n  36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 38 of 83  PageID.38\nthreatened species. 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(a). If so, and unless it is determined that the \nagency’s proposed actions are “not likely to adversely affect any listed species,” \nthe agency must formally consult NMFS or USFWS to ensure it does not violate \nthe jeopardy prohibition. Id. § 402.14(b)(1); see generally id. § 402.14.   \n97.  Where the agency taking action and the consulting agency are the \nsame, as in this case with respect to several ESA-listed marine species, the agency \nmust engage in internal or intra-agency consultation. Here, this means that \nNMFS’s Sustainable Fisheries Division, which issued the April 25, 2025 letter, \nmust consult NMFS’s Protected Resources Division. NMFS’s Sustainable \nFisheries Division must also consult USFWS for any species for which USFWS is \nresponsible, such as ESA-listed seabirds. \n98.  The ESA section 7(a)(2) consultation evaluates the effects of the \nproposed action on listed species within the “action area,” which is defined as “all \nareas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action and not merely the \nimmediate area involved in the action.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.02; see also id. § \n402.14(c)(1)(ii)-(iii), (g)(1). \n99.  The result of the ESA section 7(a)(2) consultation is the preparation \nby the consulting agency—NMFS’s Protected Resources Division or USFWS—of \na “biological opinion” that describes the expected impact on listed species of \nNMFS’s Sustainable Fisheries Division’s proposal to open the Monument \n  37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 39 of 83  PageID.39\nExpansion to specific types of commercial fishing under specified conditions. 16 \nU.S.C. § 1536(b); 50 C.F.R. § 402.14. The Biological Opinion must include, \namong other things, a “detailed discussion of the effects of the action on listed \nspecies” and the consulting agency’s opinion on whether the action is “[l]ikely to \njeopardize the continued existence of a listed species.”  50 C.F.R. § \n402.14(h)(1)(iii), (iv)(A). \n100.   If the biological opinion concludes that the proposed action will \njeopardize the continued existence of threatened or endangered species, it must \nrecommend reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposed action that would \nnot jeopardize the species.  16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(h)(2).  \n101.  After the conclusion of formal consultation, an action agency is \nobliged to reinitiate consultation in several situations, including “where \ndiscretionary Federal involvement or control over the action has been retained or is \nauthorized by law and … new information reveals effects of the action that may \naffect listed species … in a manner or to an extent not previously considered” or \n“the identified action is subsequently modified in a manner that causes an effect to \nthe listed species … that was not considered in the biological opinion.” 50 C.F.R. § \n402.16(a)(2), (3). \n \n  38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 40 of 83  PageID.40\nBACKGROUND FACTS \n102.  The Monument Expansion’s marine waters are of global ecological \nimportance. The 2014 Proclamation’s ban on commercial fishing allowed these \nwaters to be havens for a vast range of marine wildlife. \n103.  The Monument Expansion is home to many protected species. Five \nspecies of ESA-listed sea turtles use these waters as migratory and feeding \ngrounds, including the critically endangered leatherback turtle. The waters are \nhabitat for twenty-two species of protected marine mammals, seven of which are \nlisted as endangered under the ESA, and also for oceanic whitetip sharks, Indo-\nWest Pacific scalloped hammerhead sharks, and giant manta rays, all of which are \nlisted as threatened under the ESA. Millions of seabirds use the Monument \nExpansion’s waters to feed themselves and their chicks, including species listed \nunder the ESA such as the endangered Hawaiian petrel and threatened Newell’s \nshearwater. Prior to the actions challenged in this litigation, the 2014 \nProclamation’s ban on commercial fishing ensured the security of these major \nreservoirs of biodiversity and their populations.  \n104.  Ecosystems that also benefited from the Monument Expansion’s \nprotections include deep water coral reefs, seamounts, guyots, submerged reefs and \nbanks, and abyssal benthic communities. Many of these habitats are understudied, \nand there are likely others yet to be discovered. \n  39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 41 of 83  PageID.41\nSeabirds \n \n105.  Seabirds are an important component of ocean and coastal ecosystems \nand play an especially important role in the Central Pacific. Seabirds with breeding \ncolonies on Jarvis Island, Wake Island, and Johnston Atoll forage on pelagic fish \nand then bring vital nutrients back to their island nesting grounds, fertilizing these \nremote islands with their guano and transforming and promoting diversity in both \nterrestrial and inshore ecosystems. Coral reefs and their communities then take up \nthese seabird nutrients, causing reef-building corals to grow four times faster in \nreefs with seabirds than those without, and contributing to larger populations of \nherbivorous fish. These herbivorous fish populations in turn increase processes that \nare essential to the long-term health of coral reefs, including grazing of algae from \nthe reef, which makes way for coral growth and reproduction, and bioerosion, \nwhich contributes to structural complexity. \n106.  Fourteen seabird species nest on Johnston Atoll, including one of the \nlargest red-tailed tropicbirds colonies in the world, with over 12,000 pairs nesting \nthere. Twelve seabird species nest on Wake Island. Jarvis Island has more nesting \nseabirds than any other island in the U.S. tropical Pacific Islands.  \n  40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 42 of 83  PageID.42\n \nFigure 3: Young red-tailed tropicbird at Johnston Atoll \n(Credit: USFWS, Pacific Islands) \n \n107.  Seabirds from these nesting colonies forage in the Monument \nExpansion to feed themselves and their chicks. Many other species of seabirds, \nincluding the endangered Hawaiian petrel and the threatened Newell’s shearwater, \nuse the pelagic waters of the Monument for foraging. \n108.  The seabirds that forage in the Monument Expansion are primarily \npelagic feeders that obtain the fish and squid they consume and feed to their young \nby associating with schools of large predatory fish, such as tuna and billfish. Large \nschools of predatory fish force schools of small pelagic fish to the surface, where \nthey become easy picking for seabirds. Otherwise, the fish would be too deep or \nscattered for the seabirds to reach. \n109.  The principal current threats at sea for these seabirds are posed by \ncommercial fisheries, through competition and mortality on fishing gear, and \n  41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 43 of 83  PageID.43\npollution. On land, alien invasive predators, habitat degradation, pollution, global \nclimate change, and sea level rise are the main threats. The protections that the \nMonument Expansion has provided assist in reducing stressors to lessen the \ncumulative impact of these factors on seabird populations.  \n110.  It is especially important to have abundant schools of small prey and \nlarge predatory fish near breeding colonies because it is much harder for newly \nhatched and inexperienced birds to find food and successfully feed far from shore \nand return home safely. The presence of natural densities of large predatory fish \nsuch as tuna within the forging radius of seabird colonies enhances the ability of \nbirds to provide adequate food for themselves and their chicks. \n111.  A leading cause of population decline for albatross worldwide is being \ncaught and drowned on the baited hooks used by commercial longline fisheries \nsuch as those the Trump Proclamation and NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter aim to \nallow back into monument waters. Data from the NMFS observer program shows \nthat, in 2024 alone, fourteen black-footed albatrosses and Laysan albatrosses were \nobserved hooked in the Hawai‘i Deep-Set Longline Fishery, which targets tuna and \nhad less than 14% observer coverage; all but one of the hooked albatrosses died. \n \n  42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 44 of 83  PageID.44\nSharks \n \n \nFigure 4: Threatened oceanic whitetip shark swimming near the surface  \n(Credit: John Carlson)  \n112.  Ocean predators, such as sharks, are some of the most important \nspecies in the marine environment. The Monument Expansion is home to many \nspecies of sharks, including grey reef, silky, hammerhead, and oceanic whitetip \nsharks. Both the oceanic whitetip shark and the Indo-West Pacific Distinct \nPopulation Segment (“DPS”) of scalloped hammerhead shark are listed as \nthreatened under the ESA.2 \n113.  Globally, shark populations have declined, and as many as half of all \nshark species are now threatened with extinction. Most sharks are unable to \nwithstand pressures from commercial fishing because they grow slowly, take many \n \n2 The ESA defines “species” to include “any distinct population segment of \nany species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.” 16 \nU.S.C. § 1532(16). \n  43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 45 of 83  PageID.45\nyears to reach sexual maturity, and produce few young. Sharks influence the \nabundance and diversity of the species below them in the food web, and their \nremoval can have severe ecological consequences. They are a keystone species in \ndecline whose protection is required for a functioning reef system.  \n114.  In the Pacific, highly migratory shark species that were once \ncategorized as among the most abundant species of large marine animals have \ndeclined significantly. Populations of some of these species, such as oceanic \nwhitetip sharks, have dropped to such low levels that fishing vessels are now \nprohibited from intentionally catching or retaining them. Despite this ban, both \nspecies are still incidentally caught and killed on longlines and in purse seines like \nthose the Trump Proclamation and NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter aim to allow back \ninto monument waters. \n115.  When NMFS listed the oceanic whitetip shark as a threatened species, \nit concluded that the species “is extremely susceptible to incidental capture in both \nlongline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range.” 83 Fed. Reg. 4,153, 4,162 \n(Jan. 30, 2018). In 2023, NMFS estimated that the Hawai‘i Deep-Set Longline \nFishery will hook an average of 1,708 oceanic whitetip sharks each year, killing \n557. Earlier this year, NMFS estimated that the American Samoa Longline Fishery \nwill hook up to 3,520 oceanic whitetip sharks every five years, with 1,809 \nmortalities, and that, in the next five years, the Western and Central Pacific Ocean \n  44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 46 of 83  PageID.46\n(“WCPO”) Purse Seine Fishery will capture another 2,945 oceanic whitetip sharks, \nof which 1,894 will die. \n116.  NMFS listed the Indo-West Pacific DPS of scalloped hammerhead \nshark as a threatened species because it faces threats that include “high at-vessel \nmortality rate associated with incidental capture in fisheries.” 79 Fed. Reg. 38,214, \n38,237 (July 3, 2014). In its biological opinions, NMFS has estimated that, every \nfive years, the Hawai‘i Deep-Set Longline Fishery hooks fourteen Indo-West \nscalloped hammerhead sharks (killing six of them), the American Samoa Longline \nFishery hooks 45 (of which it kills eighteen), and the WCPO Purse Seine Fishery \nkills another ten. \n \nMarine Mammals \n \n117.  The Monument Expansion is used by over 20 species of protected \nmarine mammals, including at least five species listed under the ESA as \nendangered: blue whale, fin whale, sei whale, sperm whale, and Hawaiian monk \nseal.  \n118.  The waters around Johnston Island are teeming with spinner dolphins. \nJohnston Island and Wake Island are visited by the critically endangered Hawaiian \nmonk seal and may hold potential as monk seal re-colonization areas. There are \nonly about 1,600 Hawaiian monk seals remaining, and starting experimental \n  45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 47 of 83  PageID.47\npopulations in locations like Johnston Atoll is a potential recovery strategy being \nconsidered. Wake Island has its own resident population of spinner dolphins.  \n119.  A wide variety of tropical and temperate water dolphin species inhabit \nthe Monument Expansion, including pantropical spotted dolphins, spinner \ndolphins, striped dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, and bottlenose dolphins. \nSeveral rarely sighted species of dolphin inhabit the area, including Fraser’s \ndolphins. This species is primarily oceanic and found in waters deeper than 1,000 \nmeters.  \n120.  Every year, whales, dolphins, and seals are caught and killed by \nfishing gear. Most of the deaths occur when marine mammals get snagged on a \nlongline, trapped in a purse seine net, or entangled in derelict fishing gear. The \nTrump Proclamation and NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter unlawfully open the door \nto these impacts in the Monument Expansion. \n \nSea Turtles \n \n121.  Several sea turtle species are found in the Monument as either part of \na nesting population or as part of a migratory route between foreign nesting and \nhigh-productivity foraging areas. In the Monument Expansion, leatherback, \nloggerhead, hawksbill, and some DPSs of green turtles are listed as endangered \nunder the ESA, and olive ridley and some DPSs of green turtles are listed as \nthreatened.  \n  46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 48 of 83  PageID.48\n \nFigure 5: Endangered Pacific Leatherback Turtle \n(Credit: Jason Isley, Scubazoo) \n  \n122.

Critically endangered leatherback sea turtles are actively \ntransiting or foraging in the Monument Expansion twelve months of the year. \nConsidering the extremely low population of leatherback sea turtles in the Pacific, \nand the miniscule percentage that are successfully tagged, the fact that these turtles \nhave been tracked navigating U.S. waters demonstrates that the monument waters \nencompass important migration routes between nesting beaches in Indonesia and \nfeeding ground off California, and need protection from the longline hooks and \npurse seine nets the Trump Proclamation and NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter \nunlawfully allow to be reintroduced. \n  47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 49 of 83  PageID.49\n123.  Commercial longline and purse seine fisheries, through incidental \n“bycatch,” are among the main causes of anthropogenic mortality of imperiled sea \nturtles. Although the rates of bycatch may appear to be relatively low, the actual \nnumbers of turtles caught are very significant in relation to the species’ populations \nand have been a main contributor to their precipitous decline in recent years.  \n124.  NMFS has estimated that, over five years: \n•  the Hawai‘i Deep-Set Longline Fishery hooks or entangles 92 \nleatherback turtles (killing 10), 77 green sea turtles (killing 74), 43 \nNorth Pacific loggerhead turtles (killing 24), and 592 olive ridley sea \nturtles (killing 545); \n•  the American Samoa Longline Fishery hooks or entangles 48 \nleatherback turtles (killing 31), 96 green sea turtles (killing 92), 61 \nolive ridley sea turtles (killing 44), and 12 hawksbill turtles (killing all \n12); and \n•  the WCPO Purse Seine Fishery captures three leatherback turtles, 38 \ngreen sea turtles (killing one or two each year), 25 South Pacific \nloggerhead turtles (killing one or two each year), 32 olive ridley sea \nturtles (killing up to one per year), and 23 hawksbill turtles (killing \none or two each year). \n  48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 50 of 83  PageID.50\n125.  The Trump Proclamation and NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter allow \nthese commercial fisheries to catch and kill imperiled sea turtles traveling through \nthe Monument Expansion. \n \nTuna  \n \n126.  Tuna are a key component of open ocean ecosystems. They are highly \nmigratory, ranging widely throughout the tropical central and western Pacific. Four \nspecies of tuna common to the region are skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye, and albacore.  \n127.  The benefits of marine protected areas to commercial fish species are \nwell studied. Marine reserves result in higher fish biomass, greater numbers of fish, \nmore species in an ecosystem, and larger fish. The Monument Expansion provides \na sanctuary where ecosystems thrive and where these species are safe from \noverfishing and have the opportunity to mature and reproduce.  \n128.  Individual tuna from different species can spend their entire life \nhistory inside the borders of a marine reserve if the area is large enough. Female \nfish that are given adequate refuge are allowed to grow older and larger, producing \ngeometrically more eggs and more viable eggs. Fish populations in protected areas \nalso spill over into adjacent waters, increasing the quantity of fish available in \nsurrounding waters. \n129.  Healthy populations of large predators such as tuna play a critical role \nin maintaining ecosystem balance, and rebuilding their numbers leads to healthy \n  49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 51 of 83  PageID.51\nand more complex food webs. Healthy ecosystems are better able to cope with, and \nrecover from, unexpected environmental changes including those from climate \nchange. \n \nCommercial Fishing \n \nFigure 6: Longlines targeting tuna hook and entangle \n seabirds, marine mammals, sea turtles, and sharks \n(Credit: https://www.bluepeacemaldives.org) \n \n130.  Commercial longline fishing is a primary cause of mortality for \nseabirds, sea turtles, and sharks in the central Pacific. The Hawai‘i Deep-Set \nLongline Fishery and the American Samoa Longline Fishery target tuna by setting \ntens of millions of hooks each year. In this industrial fishing method, baited hooks \nare suspended for hours in the water column from lines sixty or more miles long, \nand will snag turtles, marine mammals, or seabirds that either are attracted to the \n  50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 52 of 83  PageID.52\nbait or simply try to swim through the curtain of hooks. Many of these animals will \ndrown.  \n \nFigure 7: Purse Seine Fishing Technique \n(Credit: NOAA Fisheries) \n \n131.  Purse seine fishing is another major cause of injury and death to \nmarine life. The WCPO Purse Seine Fishery catches tuna by employing a net up to \na mile or more in length and 500 feet deep that encircles the school of tuna. Purse \nseining is a non-selective fishing method that captures everything that it surrounds. \nThis commercial fishing technique indiscriminately captures and entangles non-\ntarget marine species including sharks, marine mammals, manta rays, and sea \nturtles, often drowning them in the process.  \n132.  NMFS’s biological opinions document the death and injury that the \nlongline and purse seine fisheries inflict on ESA-listed species that are found in the \nMonument Expansion, including giant manta rays, Indo-West Pacific scalloped \n  51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 53 of 83  PageID.53\nhammerhead sharks, oceanic whitetip sharks, green sea turtles, leatherback turtles, \nloggerhead turtles, olive ridley turtles, hawksbill turtles, sperm whales, sei whales, \nand fin whales. These fisheries also kill and injure numerous other marine species \nthat are not ESA-listed, including marine mammals protected under the Marine \nMammal Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1361 et seq., and seabirds protected under \nthe Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 703 et seq. \n133.  Derelict commercial fishing gear, including long lines and purse seine \nnets, poses significant threats to nearshore ecosystems within the Monument. \nDerelict gear can get swept up by currents and wash toward the shoreline, killing \nturtles, sharks, fish, and other species, and destroying corals along the way.  \n \nFigure 8: Threatened Green Sea Turtle Entangled in Derelict Fishing Gear \n(Credit: NOAA Fisheries/Ari Halperin) \n  52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 54 of 83  PageID.54\n134.  Eliminating the ban on commercial fishing in the Monument \nExpansion will draw commercial fishing boats closer to the shorelines of Jarvis \nIsland, Wake Island, and Johnston Atoll, where the boats’ derelict fishing gear is \nmore likely to injure or kill reef animals, or destroy their coral habitat and food \nsource. \n \nSeamounts \n135.  There are approximately 132 seamounts within the Monument \nExpansion. These seamounts contain steep topography, which provides important \nhabitat for high-density communities of deep-sea corals and sponges. The data \nsuggest that high-density biological communities are widespread throughout the \nmonument in places with hard substrate and strong currents. \n136.  Most of the world’s ocean basins are flat, muddy abyssal plains, but \nseamounts are solid, rocky mountains that tower above the plains. Seamounts \nprotrude into the water column and have dramatic effects on the water currents \naround them. These currents both remove fine sediments from seamounts and bring \nthem an unending supply of nutrients. Therefore, seamounts often attract a \nremarkable diversity of fishes and other open ocean animals. \n137.  Because food availability above and on seamounts is often higher than \nin surrounding waters and seafloors, seamounts are biological hotspots that attract \n  53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 55 of 83  PageID.55\na diverse fauna. Pelagic predators such as sharks, tunas, billfishes, sea turtles, \nseabirds and marine mammals often congregate above seamounts. \n138.   Less than 0.1% of seamounts globally have been explored, and 15 to \n44% of the species on a seamount or seamount group are found nowhere else on \nearth, which makes seamounts extraordinary biodiversity hotspots. Roughly 5 to \n10% of invertebrates found on each survey of a seamount are new to science. Some \nseamounts are “lost worlds” having enormous pools of undiscovered species. \n139.  Seamounts may well harbor the largest number of undiscovered large \nmarine species left on earth. Unique and undiscovered seamount species hold \ntremendous potential as medicines and for biomedical research. \n140.  The remote underwater seamounts provide an important source of \nfood to species due to their associated nutrient-rich upwellings and strong localized \ncurrents, which promote growth of massive quantities of plankton. At the base of \nthe food web, these plankton hotspots are prime deep-sea feeding and spawning \ngrounds, providing a pit stop for various pelagic species as they migrate through \nthe vast open ocean. \n \nPresident Trump’s Decision to Strip Core Protections from the Monument \nExpansion  \n141.  On April 17, 2025, President Trump issued Proclamation 10918, 90 \nFed. Reg. 16,987 (Apr. 22, 2025), invoking authority under the U.S. Constitution \n  54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 56 of 83  PageID.56\nand the Antiquities Act to attempt to delete “[a]ll language under the section \nentitled ‘Management of the Marine National Monument’” in the 2014 \nProclamation, stripping from the Monument Expansion the ban on commercial \nfishing that the 2014 Proclamation established. In its place, President Trump issued \na directive that “the Secretary of Commerce shall not prohibit commercial fishing \nwithin the boundaries of the Monument” in the waters “[b]etween 50 to 200 \nnautical miles from the landward boundaries of the Monument,” i.e., in the \nMonument Expansion. \n142.  By revoking the ban on commercial fishing, the Trump Proclamation \nexposes the Monument Expansion to the resumption of activities that are \nincompatible with the proper care and management of the objects that the 2014 \nProclamation sought to protect. The Trump Proclamation revokes the monument’s \ndefining protections. If allowed to stand, the Trump Proclamation will effectively \nabolish the 2014 Proclamation’s designation of the Monument Expansion, \nrendering it a national monument in name only.  \n143.   The President has no constitutional or statutory authority to revoke or \nmodify national monument designations or protections in this manner. \n\\\\ \n \n\\\\ \n \n\\\\ \n \n  55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 57 of 83  PageID.57\nNMFS Precipitously Establishes Rules for Commercial Fishing in the Monument \nExpansion, Without Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking \n \n144.  The MSA and APA both require NMFS to solicit, consider, and \nincorporate public comment when it establishes or changes fishery management \nrules. Even the otherwise invalid Trump Proclamation recognizes this, instructing \nthe Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to “take appropriate \naction pursuant to their respective authorities under the Antiquities Act; the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; and such other \nauthorities as may be available to implement this proclamation, to regulate \nfisheries, and to ensure proper care and management of the Monument Expansion.” \nThe Trump Proclamation further directs that “[t]he Secretary of Commerce, \nthrough the Administrator of [NOAA], shall expeditiously publish new proposed \nrules in the Federal Register to amend or repeal all burdensome regulations that \nrestrict commercial fishing in the [Monument].”  \n145.  Contrary to applicable law and the directives in the Trump \nProclamation, NMFS did not engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking—starting \nwith the publication in the Federal Register of “new proposed rules”—to determine \nwhat types of commercial fishing should now be allowed in the Monument \nExpansion and under what conditions “to ensure proper care and management of \nthe Monument Expansion.” Instead, NMFS rushed a decision—with no public \nnotice or opportunity for input—that the same commercial fishing regulations that \n  56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 58 of 83  PageID.58\npreviously applied only outside the Monument would now apply in the Monument \nExpansion. \n146.  On April 25, 2025, barely one week after the Trump Proclamation, \nNMFS’s Pacific Islands Regional Office in Honolulu issued a letter addressed to \n“Dear Permit Holder,” which stated: \nThis letter is to inform you that commercial fishing is no longer \nprohibited in certain areas of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine \nNational Monument (Monument), as described herein. Specifically, \ncommercial fishing may be conducted seaward of 50 nautical miles \naround Wake Island, Johnston Atoll, and Jarvis Island to the full \nextent of the 200-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ), to the \nextent authorized under regulations implementing the Fishery \nEcosystem Plan for Western Pelagic Fisheries (50 CFR 665 Subpart \nF), the Fishery Ecosystem Plan for the Pacific Remote Island Areas \n(50 CFR 665 Subpart E), and International Fishing Regulations set \nforth in 50 CFR Part 300. \n \n147.  NMFS’s letter further instructed permit holders that they could ignore \n“federal regulations at 50 CFR §§ 665.933(a) and 665.934(a),” which remain on \nthe books. \n148.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on the basis thereof allege, \nthat NMFS sent its April 25, 2025 letter to all commercial fishing permit holders in \nthe WCPO Purse Seine Fishery, the American Samoa Longline Fishery, and the \nHawai‘i Deep-Set Longline Fishery. \n149.  NMFS has no statutory authority to issue rules regulating commercial \nfishing within the Monument Expansion in this manner.  \n  57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 59 of 83  PageID.59\n150.  All fishing within the Monument is governed by 50 C.F.R. part 665 \nsubpart H (Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument). 50 C.F.R. § \n665.930. As NMFS noted in its April 25, 2025 letter, the regulations in that subpart \nprohibit all commercial fishing in the Monument, including in the Monument \nExpansion. 50 C.F.R. §§ 665.933(a), 665.934(a); see also id. §§ 665.933(d), \n665.934(c). The regulations in 50 C.F.R. part 665 subpart H also specify the types \nof non-commercial fishing that may take place in the Monument and under what \nconditions. 50 C.F.R. §§ 665.933(b) & (e), 665.933(b) & (d), 665.935. \n151.  NMFS adopted the regulations in 50 C.F.R. part 665 subpart H \npursuant to standard Magnuson-Stevens Act procedures, which require notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking. To implement the 2009 Proclamation, which banned \ncommercial fishing and authorized the Secretaries of Commerce and of the Interior \nto “permit noncommercial fishing upon request, at specific locations in accordance \nwith this proclamation,” the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council \n(“Wespac”) initially proposed amendments to the affected fisheries management \nplans (called “fishery ecosystems plans”), as well as draft implementing \nregulations. Based on Wespac’s recommendations, NMFS then published in the \nFederal Register a proposed rule “to implement fishery management measures” for \nthe original Monument and invited the public to submit comments. 78 Fed. Reg. \n12,015, 12,016 (Feb. 21, 2013). Only after considering and responding to public \n  58 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 60 of 83  PageID.60\ncomments did NMFS promulgate the regulations. 78 Fed. Reg. 32,996, 32,997-\n33,002 (June 3, 2013). \n152.  To issue fishing rules implementing the 2014 Proclamation, NMFS \nalso engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking. Initially, Wespac recommended \nto NMFS that the previously adopted rules for the original Monument banning \ncommercial fishing and regulating non-commercial fishing be applied to the \nMonument Expansion. NMFS then published in the Federal Register a proposed \nrule to implement Wespac’s recommendation and invited public comment. 80 Fed. \nReg. 1,881 (Jan. 14, 2015). After considering and responding to public comment, \nNMFS promulgated the amended Monument fishing regulations. 80 Fed. Reg. \n15,693, 15,694 (Mar. 25, 2015). \n153.  Whether NMFS revises fishing rules for the Monument Expansion \nbased on Council recommendations or on its own, the Magnuson-Stevens Act \nrequires notice-and-comment rulemaking, as does the APA. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1854(a)-\n(c), 1855(d); 5 U.S.C. § 553. Even if NMFS could lawfully ignore the 2014 \nProclamation’s ban on commercial fishing (and it could not), the agency violated \nthe statutory mandate to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when it issued \nits April 25, 2025 letter. \n \n  59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 61 of 83  PageID.61\nNMFS Failed to Conduct Any Environmental Review Under NEPA Before Issuing \nIts April 25, 2025 Letter \n \n154.  In the past, NMFS has taken steps to comply with NEPA prior to \nmaking decisions about the rules that govern fishing in the Monument. \n155.  In 2013, following the Monument’s establishment, Wespac prepared \nan environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA that described the impact on the \nhuman environment that would result from implementing the fishing requirements \nfor the original Monument. NMFS relied on that EA and associated FONSI to \nsatisfy its obligations under NEPA before finalizing its regulations governing \nfishing in the original Monument. \n156.  In 2015, prior to issuing revised regulations to govern fishing in the \nMonument Expansion, NMFS considered relevant new information and \ncircumstances and determined that none of the new information indicated that the \nproposed action would result in a change to impacts previously considered. NMFS \ntherefore concluded that it did not need to supplement the earlier EA or FONSI and \ncould rely on them to issue regulations to prohibit commercial fishing and limit \nnon-commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion. \n157.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on the basis thereof allege, \nthat NMFS ignored NEPA entirely when it issued its April 25, 2025 letter \ninforming permit holders that “commercial fishing is no longer prohibited” in the \nMonument Expansion. \n  60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 62 of 83  PageID.62\n158.  NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter is final agency action within the \nmeaning of NEPA and the APA. Issuance of the letter marked the consummation \nof NMFS’s decision-making process, detailing the new rules that NMFS \ndetermined should govern the types of commercial fishing that would be permitted \nin the Monument Expansion and under what conditions (i.e., the same commercial \nfishing that was allowed outside the Monument prior to the Trump Proclamation). \nIn addition, the letter purported to confer new rights on holders of commercial \nfishing permits, allowing them immediately to fish in the Monument Expansion, \nwhich previously was off-limits to them, and authorizing them to ignore the \nregulations that remained on the books banning such commercial fishing. Other \nlegal consequences flowed from NMFS’s letter, which made it clear that the \npublic, including Plaintiffs, would have no opportunity to provide input—in \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking under the Magnuson-Stevens Act or with respect \nto an environmental document prepared under NEPA—before NMFS made up its \nmind about the commercial fishing that would be authorized in the Monument \nExpansion. \n159.  Opening the Monument Expansion to commercial fishing “has a \nreasonably foreseeable significant effect on the quality of the human environment,” \n42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(1), allowing highly destructive fishing practices that threaten \nto devastate the pristine ecosystems, imperiled species, and scientific wonders in \n  61 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 63 of 83  PageID.63\nthe Monument Expansion that the 2014 Proclamation sought to protect. NMFS \nwas, accordingly, obliged to prepare an EIS before making a decision about the \ncommercial fishing that would be authorized in the Monument Expansion. \n160.  At a minimum, NMFS was obliged to prepare an EA to determine \nwhether its proposed course of action would have a reasonably foreseeable \nsignificant effect on the quality of the human environment. Id. § 4336(b)(2). \n161.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on the basis thereof allege, \nthat, prior to issuing its April 25, 2025 letter, NMFS failed to conduct any NEPA \nanalysis that took the requisite “hard look” at the impacts of NMFS’s chosen \ncourse of action and that considered a reasonable range of alternate approaches to \nfor permitting commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion. Plaintiffs are \nfurther informed and believe, and on the basis thereof allege, that, prior to issuing \nits April 25, 2025 letter, NMFS did not make a threshold determination that any \ncategorical exclusion covered its proposed action. \n162.  NMFS has no possible justification for its failure to comply with \nNEPA. No other provision of law precluded NMFS from preparing an EIS or EA. \nAnd the Trump Proclamation authorized NMFS to exercise its discretion when \nregulating commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion to determine what \ntypes of commercial fishing would be consistent with the Trump Proclamation’s \ninstructions “to ensure proper care and management of the Monument Expansion.” \n  62 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 64 of 83  PageID.64\nNMFS Failed to Consult Under ESA Section 7 Before Authorizing Fishing in the \nMonument Expansion \n \n163.  NMFS knows full well that the types of commercial fishing to which \nit gave the green light in its April 25, 2025 letter—longline fishing and purse seine \nfishing—adversely affect ESA-listed species, triggering NMFS’s obligation to \nengage in formal consultation under ESA section 7(a)(2). In recent years, NMFS’s \nSustainable Fisheries Division has consulted NMFS’s Protected Resources \nDivision to secure biological opinions for the Hawai‘i Deep-Set Longline Fishery, \nthe American Samoa Longline Fishery, and the WCPO Purse Seine Fishery. In \nthose biological opinions, NMFS has concluded that these fisheries kill and injure \nESA-listed species that are found in the Monument Expansion, including giant \nmanta rays, Indo-West Pacific scalloped hammerhead sharks, oceanic whitetip \nsharks, green sea turtles, leatherback turtles, loggerhead turtles, olive ridley turtles, \nhawksbill turtles, sperm whales, sei whales, and fin whales. \n164.  Prior to the Trump Proclamation, commercial fishing was banned \nwithin the Monument Expansion. Accordingly, the current biological opinions for \nthe Hawai‘i Deep-Set Longline Fishery, the American Samoa Longline Fishery, \nand the WCPO Purse Seine Fishery each exclude from their analysis fishing by \nthese fisheries within the Monument Expansion.  \n165.  NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter purported to open the Monument \nExpansion to highly destructive fishing techniques that previously had been \n  63 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 65 of 83  PageID.65\nbanned, modifying the activities of the Hawai‘i Deep-Set Longline Fishery, the \nAmerican Samoa Longline Fishery, and the WCPO Purse Seine Fishery in a \nmanner that NMFS knew would cause “an effect to the listed species … that was \nnot considered in the [existing] biological opinion[s].” 50 C.F.R. § 402.16(a)(3). \nBecause the Trump Proclamation did not specify what types of commercial fishing \nmust be allowed in the Monument Expansion or under what circumstances, even if \nthe proclamation were lawful (and it is not), NMFS retained “discretionary … \ncontrol over the action,” triggering its obligation to reinitiate consultation. Id. § \n402.16(a). \n166.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on the basis thereof allege, \nthat, prior to issuing its April 25, 2025 letter, NMFS failed to reinitiate consultation \nunder ESA 7(a)(2) regarding the opening of the Monument Expansion to purse \nseine fishing and longline fishing, both of which have well-established track \nrecords of killing, injuring, and otherwise causing “take” of endangered and \nthreatened marine species that are present in the Monument Expansion. \n   \nPresident Trump’s and the Agency Defendants’ Actions Harm Plaintiffs’ Interests \nby Eliminating Vital Protections that the 2014 Proclamation Established. \n \n167.  Each of the Plaintiff organizations has individual members who use \nand enjoy the Monument Expansion for a variety of purposes, including scientific \nstudy, wildlife viewing, cultural and spiritual purposes, and aesthetic appreciation.  \n  64 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 66 of 83  PageID.66\n168.  Plaintiffs’ members value the beauty, remoteness, and largely \nunspoiled nature of the Monument Expansion and the geological, scientific, \nhistorical, cultural, biological, and ecological resources found throughout the \nMonument Expansion. The 2014 Proclamations benefited Plaintiffs’ members by \nwithdrawing this area from commercial fishing and other harmful activities. \n169.  Plaintiffs’ members’ use and enjoyment of the entire Monument have \nbeen enhanced by the Monument Expansion as specified in the 2014 Proclamation, \nbecause the area’s priceless and fragile resources received critical protection above \nand beyond prior management, specifically the prohibition on commercial fishing \nin pelagic waters from 50 to 200 nautical miles around Jarvis, Wake, and Johnston \nAtoll.  \n170.  President Trump’s Proclamation directing the revocation of the ban on \ncommercial fishing in the Monument Expansion and NMFS’s precipitous \nimplementation of that directive in its April 25, 2025 letter adversely affect \nPlaintiffs’ members’ interests by unlawfully removing the prohibition on \ncommercial fishing in the Monument Expansion, allowing activities to commence \nthat will expose irreplaceable resources to heightened risk of harm, interfere with \nongoing scientific research, and conflict with the area’s unique value to Plaintiffs \nand their members. \n  65 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 67 of 83  PageID.67\n171.  Reopening the Monument Expansion to commercial fishing will likely \nlead to vessel traffic and noise; result in bycatch and entanglement of marine \nmammals and other marine wildlife in fishing gear; disturb feeding and foraging \nseabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals, and other marine wildlife; damage fragile \ncorals; impair the entire Monument’s usefulness as a scientific reference and \ncontrol site; and deleteriously alter the area’s ecology and ecosystems, such as by \ndepleting forage fish stocks, removing top predators, and extracting large numbers \nof fish and other species from the Monument Expansion. \n172.  Reopening the Monument Expansion to commercial fishing will also \nharm endangered, threatened, and vulnerable species like whales, sea turtles, and \nseabirds, by disrupting the areas on which they depend for feeding and migration, \nas well as injuring and killing animals directly. These impacts could adversely \naffect wildlife populations as a whole, reducing their availability to be viewed, \nstudied, and enjoyed in the wild. \n173.  Reopening the Monument Expansion to commercial fishing will \ninterfere with scientific investigations by continuing to harm and potentially \nextirpate the numerous species there that have yet to be identified and investigated.  \n174.  Reopening the area to commercial fishing will make it impossible to \nuse the Monument as control areas for comparative studies of the effects of human \ndisturbances on ocean ecosystems. Scientists, including Plaintiffs’ members, are \n  66 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 68 of 83  PageID.68\nusing the Monument as unique control areas that would help them study the \nimpacts of commercial fishing on similar areas of the Pacific Ocean. They also are \nusing the Monument to analyze the ecological and other benefits associated with \nlandscape-scale closed marine areas. This will no longer be possible if the \ncommercial fishing prohibition is revoked.  \n175.  President Trump’s and the Agency Defendants’ actions render one of \nthe world’s most pristine, unique areas vulnerable to immediate harm, and thus \ninjure the scientific, professional, educational, recreational, cultural, spiritual, \nreligious, subsistence, and aesthetic values that Plaintiffs’ members derive from the \nMonument.  \n \nAgency Defendants have failed to carry out their duties under the 2014 \nProclamation \n  \n176.  NMFS has already flouted the 2014 Proclamation’s command to ban \ncommercial fishing in the Monument Expansion, issuing its April 25, 2025 letter \ngiving the green light for commercial fishing to resume immediately. Defendants \nLutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler have already violated their duty to ensure \nNMFS’s compliance with the 2014 Proclamation. \n177.  Defendant Burgum has done nothing to stop them, despite the \nDepartment of the Interior’s authority over refuges, which include the entire \nMonument Expansion. \n  67 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 69 of 83  PageID.69\n178.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on the basis thereof allege, \nthat, due to President Trump’s action, Agency Defendants have decided that they \nwill no longer implement the 2014 Proclamation’s requirement that they prohibit \ncommercial fishing within the Monument Expansion. \n179.  President Trump, by purporting to remove restrictions put in place by \nthe 2014 Proclamation, and Agency Defendants, by refusing to carry out their \nduties under the 2014 Proclamation, have deprived Plaintiffs of the benefits of the \nprotections in 2014 Proclamation.  \n180.  President Trump’s and the Agency’s Defendants’ actions adversely \naffect and irreparably injure Plaintiffs’ and their members’ interests, and that injury \nwill continue unless the Court grants the relief Plaintiffs seek.  \n181.  Plaintiffs’ injuries would be redressed by the relief sought here.  \n182.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Antiquities Act against Defendant Trump) \n \n183.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set \nforth in this Complaint.  \n184.  Judicial review is available to ensure that presidential actions are \nconsistent with constitutional principles and that the President has not exceeded his \nstatutory authority.  \n  68 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 70 of 83  PageID.70\n185.  The President has the authority to regulate federal property or foreign \nand interstate commerce only to the limited extent that Congress has delegated that \nauthority to the President.  \n186.  In his April 17, 2025, Proclamation, President Trump exceeded his \nauthority under the Antiquities Act, 54 U.S.C. §§ 320301 et seq. Under the Act, \nCongress authorized the President to “designate” national monuments and to \n“reserve” lands and waters for the protection of objects of historic or scientific \ninterest, but did not authorize the President to undo such designations or to abolish \nsuch reservations, in whole or in part.  \n187.  As a result, President Trump’s Proclamation exceeded the scope of his \nauthority, is ultra vires, and is unlawful. \n \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(U.S. Constitution, art. II, and Separation-of-Powers Doctrine,  \nagainst Defendant Trump) \n \n188.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set \nforth in this Complaint. \n189.  Judicial review is available to ensure that presidential actions are \nconsistent with constitutional principles and that the President has not unlawfully \nintruded on Congress’s exclusive power over federal property and foreign and \ninterstate commerce under the Constitution. U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2; id. art. I, \n§ 8, cl. 3.  \n  69 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 71 of 83  PageID.71\n190.  The President has the authority to regulate federal property and \nforeign and interstate commerce only to the limited extent that Congress has \ndelegated that authority to the President.  \n191.  Congress has not delegated authority to the President to revoke \nprotections for the proper care and management of monument objects or to abolish \na national monument reservation, in whole or in part. In the Antiquities Act, \nCongress retained that authority for itself. \n192.  In issuing his Proclamation, President Trump exceeded his authority \nunder Article II of the U.S. Constitution and intruded on Congress’s exclusive \npower to regulate federal property and foreign and interstate commerce under the \nProperty and Commerce Clauses, in violation of the doctrine of separation of \npowers.  \n \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(U.S. Const. art. II, § 3 and Take Care Clause,  \nagainst Defendant Trump) \n \n193.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set \nforth in this Complaint. \n194.  The United States Constitution requires the President to “take Care \nthat the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art II, § 3. \n195.  The 2014 Proclamation, which was a lawful exercise of congressional \nauthority delegated to President Obama under the Antiquities Act, is a “law” \n  70 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 72 of 83  PageID.72\nwithin the meaning of the “take Care” clause. The Constitution requires President \nTrump to faithfully execute that law. \n196.  President Trump must also “take Care” to faithfully execute the \nAntiquities Act, including its narrow delegation of authority to Presidents to \ndeclare national monuments and reserve federal lands, but not abolish them or \nrevoke reservations. \n197.  President Trump has violated the “Take Care” clause of the U.S. \nConstitution by attempting to eliminate from the Monument Expansion the core \nreservation—a ban on commercial fishing—that the 2014 Proclamation lawfully \nestablished under the Antiquities Act to provide for the proper care and \nmanagement of the scientific and historic objects in the Monument Expansion.  \n \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act against the Agency Defendants) \n \n198.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set \nforth in this Complaint. \n199.  The APA confers a right of action on any person adversely affected by \na final agency action or a failure to act and waives the federal government’s \nsovereign immunity. 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n200.  Because President Trump had no lawful authority to revoke \nprotections from the Monument Expansion, the Secretaries of Commerce and the \n  71 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 73 of 83  PageID.73\nInterior and their subordinate officers remain subject to the 2014 Proclamation’s \ndirection to prohibit commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion. \n201.  Any action by the Agency Defendants contrary to 2014 Proclamation \nis arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law.  \n202.  As a result of President Trump’s Proclamation, Defendants Lutnick, \nGrimm, and Piñeiro Soler have already violated their duty to ensure NMFS’s \ncompliance with the 2014 Proclamation, and Defendant Burgum has done nothing \nto stop them, despite the Department of the Interior’s authority over refuges, which \ninclude the entire Monument Expansion. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \non the basis thereof allege, that the Agency Defendants have no intention of \ncarrying out their duties to prohibit commercial fishing under the 2014 \nProclamation as long as President Trump’s Proclamation remains in effect. \n \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Magnuson-Stevens Act and Administrative Procedure Act – Failure  \nto Revise Fishing Rules Through Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking –  \nagainst Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler) \n \n203.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set \nforth in this Complaint. \n204.  Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler are responsible for \nensuring that NMFS complies with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the APA. \n  72 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 74 of 83  PageID.74\n205.  All fishing within the Monument, including in the Monument \nExpansion, is governed by 50 C.F.R. part 665 subpart H (Pacific Remote Islands \nMarine National Monument). 50 C.F.R. § 665.930. \n206.  To implement the Trump Proclamation, NMFS issued its April 25, \n2025 letter, which purports to revise the rules governing fishing in the Monument \nExpansion to specify which commercial fishing techniques are now allowed and \nunder what conditions.  \n207.  Whether NMFS revises fishing rules for the Monument Expansion \nbased on Council recommendations or on its own, the Magnuson-Stevens Act and \nAPA mandate notice-and-comment rulemaking before NMFS may adopt any \nfishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulation. 16 U.S.C. §§ \n1854(a)-(c), 1855(d); 5 U.S.C. § 553. NMFS failed to comply with these statutory \nrequirements before issuing its April 25, 2025 letter. \n208.  By issuing the April 25, 2025 letter rather than engaging in notice-\nand-comment rulemaking to revise the rules governing fishing in the Monument \nExpansion, NMFS violated the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the Administrative \nProcedure Act.    \n209.  NMFS’s actions are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not \nin accordance with law, and/or without observance of procedure required by law \nwithin the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n  73 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 75 of 83  PageID.75\nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Failure to Revise  \nFishing Rules Through Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking –  \nagainst Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler) \n \n210.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set \nforth in this Complaint. \n211.  Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler are responsible for \nensuring that NMFS complies with the APA. \n212.  Even if NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter is not deemed a fishery \nmanagement plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulation adopted pursuant to the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act, section 4 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553, required NMFS to \nengage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before revising the rules for fishing \nwithin the Monument Expansion. The rules that NMFS articulated in its letter are \n“legislative rules” because NMFS intended them to have the “force and effect of \nlaw.” Chrysler Corp., 441 U.S. at 302-03 (cleaned up). NMFS failed to comply \nwith this statutory requirement before issuing its April 25, 2025 letter. \n213.  By issuing the April 25, 2025 letter rather than engaging in notice-\nand-comment rulemaking to revise the rules governing fishing in the Monument \nExpansion, NMFS violated the Administrative Procedure Act.    \n214.  NMFS’s actions are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not \nin accordance with law, and/or without observance of procedure required by law \nwithin the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n  74 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 76 of 83  PageID.76\nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq.,  \nand Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.,  \nagainst Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler) \n \n215.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set \nforth in this Complaint. \n216.  The Department of Commerce, NOAA, and NMFS are “agencies of \nthe Federal Government” and, therefore, must comply with NEPA. 42 U.S.C. § \n4332(2). \n217.  Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler are responsible for \nensuring that NMFS complies with NEPA. \n218.  NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter constitutes “major Federal action” for \npurposes of NEPA because it is an action “subject to substantial Federal control \nand responsibility.” Id. § 4336e(10)(A). \n219.  NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter constitutes “final agency action” within \nthe meaning of NEPA and the APA because issuance of the letter marked the \nconsummation of NMFS’s decision-making process, the letter purported to confer \nnew rights on holders of commercial fishing permits, allowing them immediately \nto fish in the Monument Expansion, and other legal consequences flowed from \nNMFS’s letter, which made it clear that the public, including Plaintiffs, would have \nno opportunity to provide input—in notice-and-comment rulemaking under the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act or with respect to an environmental document prepared \n  75 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 77 of 83  PageID.77\nunder NEPA—before NMFS made up its mind about the commercial fishing that \nwould be authorized in the Monument Expansion. \n220.  NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter authorized highly destructive fishing \npractices that threaten to devastate the pristine ecosystems, imperiled species, and \nscientific wonders in the Monument Expansion that the 2014 Proclamation sought \nto protect. NMFS’s action “has a reasonably foreseeable significant effect on the \nquality of the human environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 4336(b)(1). \n221.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on the basis thereof allege, \nthat, prior to issuing its April 25, 2025 letter, NMFS failed to conduct any NEPA \nanalysis that took the requisite “hard look” at the impacts of NMFS’s chosen \ncourse of action and that considered a reasonable range of alternate approaches to \nfor permitting commercial fishing in the Monument Expansion. Plaintiffs are \nfurther informed and believe, and on the basis thereof allege, that, prior to issuing \nits April 25, 2025 letter, NMFS did not make a threshold determination that any \ncategorical exclusion covered its proposed action. \n222.  NMFS’s decision to issue its April 25, 2025 letter without first \npreparing a legally adequate EA or EIS violates NEPA. \n223.  NMFS’s decision to issue its April 25, 2025 letter without first \npreparing a legally adequate EA or EIS is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n  76 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 78 of 83  PageID.78\ndiscretion, not in accordance with law, and/or without observance of procedure \nrequired by law within the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Magnuson-Stevens Act and Administrative Procedure Act – Failure  \nto Ensure Consistency With Applicable Law –  \nagainst Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler) \n \n224.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set \nforth in this Complaint. \n225.  Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler are responsible for \nensuring that NMFS complies with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the APA. \n226.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act authorizes NMFS to approve a fishery \nmanagement plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulation only if it is consistent \nwith “applicable law.” 16 U.S.C. § 1854(a)(1)(A), (b)(1); see also id. §§ \n1853(a)(1)(C), 1854(a)(3). \n227.  For the reasons set forth above, and in the Seventh Claim for Relief, \nthe April 25, 2025 letter is not consistent with NEPA, which is an applicable law. \n228.  The April 25, 2025 letter also is not consistent with the ESA, another \napplicable law.  \n229.  Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2), requires NMFS’s \nSustainable Fisheries Division, in consultation with the NMFS’s Protected \nResources Division and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to ensure that any \n  77 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 79 of 83  PageID.79\naction it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not likely to jeopardize the continued \nexistence of any threatened or endangered species. \n230.  Because commercial fishing was banned within the Monument \nExpansion prior to the Trump Proclamation, the current biological opinions for the \nHawai‘i Deep-Set Longline Fishery, the American Samoa Longline Fishery, and \nthe WCPO Purse Seine Fishery each exclude from their analysis fishing by these \nfisheries within the Monument Expansion.  \n231.  NMFS’s issuance of the April 25, 2025 letter, which purports to open \nthe Monument Expansion to highly destructive fishing activities that have a track \nrecord of killing and injuring the ESA-listed species found in the Monument \nExpansion, constitutes a federal agency action that “may affect” species protected \nunder the ESA.  50 C.F.R. §§ 402.02, 402.14(a). By opening the Monument \nExpansion to highly destructive fishing techniques that previously had been \nbanned, NMFS’s letter modified the activities of the Hawai‘i Deep-Set Longline \nFishery, the American Samoa Longline Fishery, and the WCPO Purse Seine \nFishery in a manner that NMFS knew would cause “an effect to the listed species \n… that was not considered in the [existing] biological opinion[s].” Id. § \n402.16(a)(3).  \n232.  Because the Trump Proclamation did not specify what types of \ncommercial fishing must be allowed in the Monument Expansion or under what \n  78 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 80 of 83  PageID.80\ncircumstances, even if the proclamation were lawful (and it is not), NMFS retained \n“discretionary … control over the action,” triggering its obligation to reinitiate \nconsultation. Id. § 402.16(a).  \n233.  Under ESA Section 7(a)(2), NMFS’s Sustainable Fisheries Division \nwas required—but failed—to consult NMFS’s Protected Resources Division on the \neffects of the commercial fishing proposed in its April 25, 2025 letter prior to \nissuing that letter. The April 25, 2025 letter, therefore, is not consistent with the \nESA.3 \n234.  NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter is not consistent with the 2014 \nProclamation, which is applicable law. \n235.  In issuing the April 25, 2025 letter, NMFS also failed to comply with \nthe directives in the otherwise unlawful Trump Proclamation, which instructed \nNMFS to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking—starting with the \npublication in the Federal Register of “new proposed rules”—to determine what \ntypes of commercial fishing should now be allowed in the Monument Expansion \nand under what conditions “to ensure proper care and management of the \nMonument Expansion.” Assuming for the sake of argument that the Trump \nProclamation is lawful, NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter is not consistent with it. \n \n3 Plaintiffs intend to bring a separate claim pursuant to the ESA’s citizen suit \nprovision after giving the requisite notice of intent to sue. See 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g). \n  79 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 81 of 83  PageID.81\n236.  NMFS’s decision to issue its April 25, 2025 letter in spite of the \nletter’s inconsistencies with applicable law violates the Magnuson-Stevens Act and \nis arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with law, and/or \nwithout observance of procedure required by law within the meaning of the APA, \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE plaintiffs request that the Court:  \n1.  Declare that Defendant President Trump’s Proclamation is ultra vires \nand exceeds his authority under the Antiquities Act; \n2.  Declare that Defendant President Trump’s Proclamation exceeds the \nscope of his authority under Article II of the U.S. Constitution and violates the \nseparation of powers doctrine and the “Take Care” clause; \n3.  Declare that Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler have \nviolated the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the APA as described above because \nNMFS failed to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before issuing its April \n25, 2025 letter that purports to revise the rules for fishing within the Monument \nExpansion and otherwise failed to comply with all applicable law, including \nNEPA, the ESA, the 2014 Proclamation, and (assuming for the sake of argument \nthat it is lawful) the Trump Proclamation; \n  80 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00209-WRP-NONE     Document 1     Filed 05/22/25     Page 82 of 83  PageID.82\n4.  Declare that Defendants Lutnick, Grimm, and Piñeiro Soler have \nviolated NEPA and the APA as described above by failing to prepare any \nenvironmental document to accompany NMFS’s April 25, 2025 letter that (1) takes \nthe requisite “hard look” at the environmental impacts of the proposed commercial \nfishing activities in the Monument Expansion, (2) considers a reasonable range of \nalternatives, and (3) provides opportunities for public comment on NMFS’s \nproposal operations and reasonable alternatives; \n5.
