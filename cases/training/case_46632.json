The plaintiffs filed this class action suit on behalf of over 9,000 children in its foster care system. Represented by attorneys from non-profit legal organizations and private law firms alike, the plaintiffs sued the Tennessee Department of Children&rsquo;s Services under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act, and the Medicaid Act. The complaint alleged that the state&rsquo;s foster care system was warehousing children in facilities lacking basic living necessities, contracting with facilities with long records of physical, mental, and sexual abuse, moving children between temporary facilities for an indefinitely long period of time, and providing &ldquo;overworked and undertrained&rdquo; caseworkers unable to reliably oversee the children&rsquo;s wellbeing. The complaint also alleged that the foster care system had previously seen much improvement under court supervision until 2017, as part of the settlement of Brian A. v. Bredesen, Case No. 3:00-CV-00445, but had since undergone a regression in standards of care. Seeking class certification, the children sought for the court to permanently enjoin the state from subjecting them to such treatment, and to require the state to provide all incoming foster children an &ldquo;adequate and individualized&rdquo; written case plan within 60 days of entering care. The case was assigned to District Judge Aleta Arthur Trauger.</p>\r\n<p>About one month later, on June 16th, 2025, an amended complaint was filed, in which six additional children were added as named plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. The defendants alleged that the court lacked jurisdiction, and the plaintiffs lacked standing, because the relief sought by plaintiffs was not likely to redress the alleged injuries. The defendants alleged that relief would require this Court to oversee nearly every aspect of the State&rsquo;s child welfare system, which would interfere with the principles of federalism and comity. Moreover, the defendants alleged that the plaintiffs failed to allege facts to support their claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of October 2025, litigation is ongoing.</p>",

Tennessee’s foster care system is failing the children it is intended to protect. \nTennessee’s Department of Children’s Services (“DCS”) warehouses children in spaces which \nlack the basic necessities of life, including adequate food, bedding, soap, and potable water. \nIntended as temporary placements, DCS leaves children in these situations for months on end. \nOnce placed in ‘long-term’ placements, children fare no better. DCS contracts with facilities which \npossess well-known track records of physical, mental, and sexual abuse. Children are placed in \nfoster homes that have not been properly vetted, do not receive necessary information about the \nchildren, and do not receive the services necessary to care for them. Foster care is intended to be \ntemporary, until children can either be reunited with their families or placed in another permanent \nhome; however, children in Tennessee linger in foster care and are moved from place to place \nwithout the opportunity for a stable childhood.  \n2.  The caseworkers required to support and protect foster children are overworked and \nundertrained. Due to crushing caseloads, DCS caseworkers are unable to reliably perform the basic \nduties necessary to oversee the well-being of the foster children assigned to their care. As \nconcluded by a state audit in 2022, “[t]he safety, permanency, and well-being of Tennessee’s most \nvulnerable children is in jeopardy.” \n3.  DCS’s dereliction of care is no mere oversight or mistake. It has been previously \nsued in federal court for violating the rights of foster children. As a result of the suit, DCS improved \nmany  aspects  of  the  foster  care  system,  until  the  court  ended  its  jurisdiction  over  DCS’s \n2 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 2 of 82 PageID #: 171\n\nperformance metrics in 2017. However, eight years later, the state of Tennessee’s child welfare \nsystem is just as bad, if not worse, than the crisis which engendered the previous lawsuit. \n4.  In 2000, a putative federal class action lawsuit was filed against Tennessee’s child \nwelfare system, asserting that the system that was supposed to protect and benefit children was \ninstead violating their constitutional and federal statutory rights. Brian A., et al. v. Bredesen, et al., \nCase No. 3:00-CV-00445 (“Brian A.”). After a failed effort to dismiss the lawsuit, the Brian A. \ndefendants—the Governor of Tennessee and the Commissioner of DCS—agreed to a settlement \npursuant to which they would implement systematic reform (the “Brian A. Settlement”). Under \nthe terms of the Brian A. Settlement, the State defendants agreed that the Middle District of \nTennessee would have continuing jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the Brian A. Settlement, \nand that such jurisdiction would terminate when the State defendants had accomplished certain \nexit criteria—criteria designed to ensure that the State defendants were upholding their basic \nobligations to children in the State’s custody, and that children’s fundamental rights were being \nprotected.  \n5.  Over the next decade, in compliance with the Brian A. Settlement and under court \nsupervision, the State made substantial changes to its child welfare system, which resulted in a \nsignificant improvement in the lives of children in the State’s custody. Former DCS Commissioner \nJim Henry later acknowledged: “We’ve got to be honest: we didn’t have a system here in 2000. I \nmean, we deserved to get a lawsuit. The fact is, we’re a much better system now. We’re better off \nfor it, the kids are better off, and I think the taxpayers are better off.” \n6.  After  16  years  of  court-supervised  reform,  in  2017,  the  Middle  District  of \nTennessee determined that the State defendants had satisfied the performance metric criteria \n3 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 3 of 82 PageID #: 172\n\nidentified in the Brian A. Settlement, and agreed to dismiss the majority of the lawsuit, ending the \ncourt’s oversight of DCS’s performance.  \n7.  Things quickly declined in the absence of court supervision. Within just a few \nyears, the hard-fought changes mandated by Brian A. all but vanished, and DCS is once again \ndepriving children of their basic rights—rights that are protected by the U.S. Constitution, as well \nas by federal statutes.  \n8.  Once again, Tennessee children in need of care and protection are being denied \ntheir constitutional and federal statutory rights and are placed at substantial risk of serious harm as \na result of Defendants’ actions and inactions.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n10.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  Plaintiffs’  federal  claims  pursuant  to  28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2002 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n12.  Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial \npart of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District, and \nDefendants maintain offices and conduct business in this District. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n4 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 4 of 82 PageID #: 173\n\n14.  This action consists of one general class and one subclass; each class is sufficiently \nnumerous to make joinder impracticable. The general class consists of at least 9,000 children who \nare in the legal and/or physical custody of DCS and/or with whom DCS has a special relationship \n(the “General Class”). The subclass consists of the thousands of General Class members who have \nor will have emotional, psychological, cognitive, or physical disabilities (the “ADA Subclass”).  \nNumerosity: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n15.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The General \nClass consists of at least 9,000 children who are or will be in the legal and/or physical custody \nof DCS and/or with whom DCS has a special relationship.  \n16.  The ADA Subclass consists of thousands of children with disabilities who are or \nwill be in the legal and/or physical custody of DCS and/or with whom DCS has a special \nrelationship.  \nTypicality: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3)  \n \n17.  The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are representative of those of the General Class \nand/or the ADA Subclass, as they stem from the same policies, practices, or patterns of conduct, \nand are grounded in the same legal theories as the General Class and/or the ADA Subclass’s \nclaims. \n18.  The questions of fact and law raised by Named Plaintiffs are common and typical \nof each putative member of the classes whom they seek to represent.  \n19.  Questions of fact common to the General Class include:  \na.  Whether Defendants fail to provide children in Tennessee state custody with \nsafe, secure, and appropriate foster care placements as required by law and \nreasonable professional standards;  \n5 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 5 of 82 PageID #: 174\n\nb.  Whether Defendants fail to provide and implement legally mandated case \nplans, including plans for permanent placement; \nc.  Whether Defendants fail to provide children with legally required services, \nconsistent with reasonable professional standards, necessary to prevent \nthem  from  deteriorating  physically,  psychologically,  emotionally,  and \neducationally;  \nd.  Whether Defendants fail to conduct timely mental and physical evaluations \nof children who enter the State’s custody;  \ne.  Whether Defendants fail to maintain a case management system capable of \nadequately protecting foster children; \nf.  Whether Defendants fail to maintain a system that protects foster children \nfrom physical, psychological, and emotional harm; and \ng.  Whether Defendants fail to maintain a system that provides permanency to \nchildren within a reasonable period of time. \n20.  Questions of law common to the General Class include:  \na.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ substantive due \nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;  \nb.  Whether  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate  Plaintiffs’  rights  to  a \npermanent home and family, as well as their rights to be free from harm and \nhave  their  basic  needs  met,  under  the  First,  Ninth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution; \n6 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 6 of 82 PageID #: 175\n\nc.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997; and  \nd.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nMedicaid Act; \ne.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate the Equal Protection Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment. \n21.  Questions of fact common to the ADA Subclass include: \na.  Whether Defendants supervise the State’s foster care system in a manner \nthat denies qualified children with disabilities the benefits of the State’s \nservices, programs, or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto their needs, and; \nb.  Whether Defendants fail to reasonably modify the State’s foster care system \nto avoid discrimination against children with disabilities. \n22.  Questions of law common to the ADA Subclass include: \na.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and their respective \nimplementing regulations by unnecessarily placing youth with disabilities \nin institutional settings, or placing them at risk thereof, instead of providing \nreasonable accommodations in community-based and/or least restrictive \nsettings;  denying  them  access  to  meaningful,  individualized,  and \nappropriate community-based treatment and support which would enable \n7 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 7 of 82 PageID #: 176\n\nchildren with disabilities to remain in the community; and failing to ensure \nthat state and local officials make available a full range of home- and \ncommunity-based placements, as well as the necessary and appropriate \ncommunity-based  services,  which  would  guarantee  access  to  the  least \nrestrictive and most integrated setting appropriate to their needs; and  \nb.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nADA, RA, and their respective implementing regulations by failing to \nprovide  reasonable  accommodations  such  as,  but  not  limited  to: \ncommunity-based mental and behavioral services and access to programs, \nprofessionals,  and/or  equipment  necessary  to  treat  or  accommodate \ndisabilities. \nAdequacy: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n23.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately safeguard the interests of the \nclasses they seek to represent. Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds that apply broadly \nto all class members, warranting class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs’ counsel is \nunaware of any conflicts among class members. The Named Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys \nwith extensive experience in class action litigation, child welfare litigation, and complex litigation. \n24.  Marcia Robinson Lowry, Robyn Goldberg, and Anastasia Benedetto are attorneys \nwith A Better Childhood, Inc., a non-profit legal organization, which has extensive experience and \nexpertise in federal child welfare class action litigation actions throughout the U.S. \n25.  Margaret Zwisler, William O’Reilly, and Julie Gorla are attorneys with the Barbara \nMcDowell Social Justice Center, and each has extensive experience and expertise in federal civil \nlitigation and class actions throughout the U.S. \n8 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 8 of 82 PageID #: 177\n\n26.  Wesley R. Powell, Justin Garbacz, and Amanda M. Payne are attorneys with \nWillkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, a law firm whose attorneys are experienced in class action civil \nrights litigation. \n27.  Eric Hecker, of Wang Hecker LLP, is an experienced civil rights litigator who has \nrepresented foster children in individual and class actions and has served as lead counsel in class \nactions arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n28.  Sarah B. Miller and Miranda MacNaughton are attorneys with Bass, Berry & Sims, \nPLC, a law firm that routinely handles class action and civil rights lawsuits. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A) and (B) \n29.  This action is maintainable as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1). The \nGeneral Class consists of approximately 9,000 members, and the ADA Subclass consists of \nthousands of members. Individual lawsuits would risk inconsistent and varying rulings, potentially \nleading  to  conflicting  standards  of  conduct  for  Defendants.  Moreover,  separate  actions  by \nindividual members could result in decisions that, in practice, would significantly hinder other \nmembers’ ability to protect their interests. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \n30.  This action is also maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \nbecause Defendants’ policies, practices, actions, and omissions that form the basis of this \ncomplaint are common to and apply generally to all members of the General Class and ADA \nSubclass, and the injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate and will apply to all \nmembers of the Class and Subclass. \n \n \n9 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 9 of 82 PageID #: 178\n\nPARTIES \nI.  Named Plaintiffs \nKeira M. \n31.  Plaintiff Keira M. (age 11) has been in DCS custody since August 2024 and remains \nin DCS custody as of the time of this filing. While in DCS custody, DCS has subjected Keira to \nunnecessary physical, mental, and emotional harm by failing to provide timely and appropriate \nmental health treatment, placing her in overly restrictive institutional settings, and obstructing her \npath to a permanent home. \n32.  Keira appears in this action through her next friend, Stacie Odeneal. Stacie Odeneal \nis Keira’s guardian ad litem (“GAL”) and has been advocating for Keira’s best interest since Keira \ncame into DCS custody. She is very familiar with Keira’s history and is dedicated to Keira’s best \ninterests. \n33.  Keira  was  previously  adopted  out  of  DCS  custody  five  years  ago  following \nsignificant abuse and neglect by her biological parents but went back into DCS custody in August \n2024.  \n34.  After Keira was hospitalized in August 2024, Vanderbilt Hospital staff warned that \nreturning her to her adoptive home would pose an imminent risk to her and the other children. In \nresponse, her adoptive parents followed medical advice and did not allow her to return home. \nRather than support the family through crisis services, DCS took custody of Keira, alleging \nabandonment, but failed to follow its Family Crisis Intervention Program guidelines or offer \nstabilization services to preserve the adoptive placement. \n35.  DCS  then  placed  Keira  in  a  transitional  placement  facility  from  August  to \nNovember 2024, during which time she received no therapy or services despite a well-documented \n10 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 10 of 82 PageID #: 179\n\nhistory of mental health needs. Although transitional placements are intended to be short-term \nwhile  assessments  are  completed,  DCS  neither  completed  timely  assessments  nor  initiated \nappropriate services for Keira. \n36.  In  November  2024,  DCS  placed  Keira  in  a  Level  4  (the  most  restrictive) \ninstitutional facility where she remains to this day. Despite repeated requests by Keira’s GAL, \nDCS has provided no documentation to justify why this highest-level, most restrictive setting is \nappropriate for Keira, or that less restrictive alternatives were considered. \n37.  Keira has a prospective foster family ready and willing to care for her, and they \nhave completed all licensing requirements, including a home study. However, DCS has delayed \napproval of the placement by failing to review the final home study, which has been pending with \nDCS’s Office of Network Development. The prospective foster mother has a flexible weekday \nschedule which would allow her to visit Keira regularly, but the facility allows visitation only on \nSaturdays, impeding bonding. DCS has failed to intervene, despite knowing that these restrictions \nare preventing Keira from developing a relationship that could support her transition to family-\nbased care. \n38.  Reports from the facility regarding Keira’s progress are contradictory. Verbal \nupdates  are  consistently  positive,  and  Keira  has  been  allowed  to  participate  in  high-level \nprogramming typically reserved for children nearing discharge. However, written reports—all \nauthored by a single therapist—assert that Keira is not progressing and should be stripped of \nprivileges. DCS has taken no action to investigate these discrepancies or assess Keira’s actual level \nof progress. \n39.  In November 2024, Keira was denied her right to attend a Foster Care Review \nBoard (“FCRB”) meeting. The facility falsely reported that she was unavailable, although she was \n11 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 11 of 82 PageID #: 180\n\npresent on campus and could have participated via video with minimal accommodation. DCS did \nnot act to protect her right to participate in these critical permanency planning discussions. \n40.  In March 2025, after months of receiving no records regarding Keira’s diagnoses \nor treatment plan, her GAL sent a letter threatening to subpoena her medical records. Within an \nhour, the facility moved Keira to discharge status and requested a discharge planning meeting. \nHowever, because DCS had not approved the pending foster home, Keira faces the possibility of \nbeing placed in an unknown temporary setting instead of with the family ready to receive her, \nfurther destabilizing a child whose mental health issues are worsened by instability. \n41.  As a direct result of DCS’s actions and omissions, Keira has suffered and continues \nto suffer psychological and emotional harm. DCS housed her for months in temporary settings due \nto a lack of adequate placements, then transferred her to a harsh, overly restrictive facility without \ndocumentation of need. DCS has ignored credible warnings about the harm of this placement and \nfailed to pursue a less restrictive, supportive home that is available and ready. As a result, Keira \nremains without proper mental health treatment, without a path to permanency, and without the \nstability that would allow her to heal and thrive. \nDarnell H. \n42.  Darnell H. (age 15) entered DCS custody in April 2018. He remains in DCS custody \nat the time of this filing. In the seven years since entering foster care, DCS has subjected Darnell \nto unnecessary and prolonged institutionalization, deprived him of educational and therapeutic \nservices, and failed to act on multiple opportunities to secure him a safe, stable, and supportive \nhome. \n43.  Darnell appears in this action through his next friend, Sherry Taylor. Sherry Taylor \nserved as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (“CASA”); in this role, she regularly visited Darnell \n12 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 12 of 82 PageID #: 181\n\nin residential placement and assisted in advocating on his behalf in Child and Family Team \nmeetings (“CFTMs”) and court hearings. She is very familiar with Darnell’s history and is \ndedicated to his best interests. \n44.  Darnell was taken into custody at eight years of age, after Darnell’s mother struck \nhim in the face, causing him to bleed, and abandoned him on the side of the road. Darnell found a \nfirehouse, where he was treated by emergency medical technicians (“EMTs”). The EMTs took \nDarnell to the hospital for treatment. The hospital then contacted DCS, and Darnell was taken into \nDCS custody. \n45.  Over the past seven years, DCS has bounced Darnell between at least 15 separate \nplacements. DCS has kept him unnecessarily in institutional placements for over 90% of this time. \nThis repeated institutionalization has harmed Darnell, retraumatizing him and exacerbating his \nmental health conditions.  \n46.  Adoption was added as a permanency goal for Darnell in April 2019, yet he still \nremains in DCS custody.  \n47.  In November 2020, DCS’s Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (“CANS”) \nassessment of Darnell indicated the appropriate placement for Darnell was a Level 2 (therapeutic) \nfoster home; nevertheless, DCS continually kept Darnell in more restrictive Level 3 and 4 \nresidential facilities, with the exception of a six-month placement in a pre-adoptive home in 2023. \n48.  A psychological evaluation from the summer of 2022 found that residential facility \nsettings continuously retraumatized Darnell and are detrimental to his mental health; the loud \nnoises, fighting, and use of restraints triggered Darnell due to his prior physical abuse. Despite \nthis, DCS has continued to house Darnell in residential facilities to the present day. \n13 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 13 of 82 PageID #: 182\n\n49.  Darnell has not received adequate educational support while in DCS custody. \nAlthough Darnell has been housed primarily in residential facilities for the past five years, neither \nDCS  nor  their  contracted  facilities  have  advocated  for  appropriate  testing,  an  accurate \nIndividualized Education Plan (“IEP”) from his school, nor ensured that he was offered appropriate \neducational services. In 2023, when Darnell was 13 years old, he was assessed as performing at a \nsecond-grade level. No remedial services are listed in his IEP as to appropriate educational services \nto help him catch up to his grade level in the required subject areas.  \n50.  When Darnell was in his first foster home in 2019, he had no IEP and was struggling \nboth in the home and at school. He was housed with two of his younger siblings. Due to the lack \nof appropriate testing, communication about his needs from DCS and an IEP, the foster mother \nremained ignorant of Darnell’s needs and held him to standards that he was unable to meet. His \nGAL repeatedly requested that DCS provide educational testing and support for Darnell and \npursue an IEP for him, but DCS refused. \n51.  Darnell disrupted from his placement with his siblings in the 2019 foster home, and \nhe was separated from his siblings, who were later adopted by that foster mother. Except for a \nbrief stay in a pre-adoptive home in 2023, Darnell has been housed in Level 3 or 4 residential \nsettings ever since. \n52.  Darnell’s former GAL was finally able to obtain an initial IEP for him in September \n2021. However, the IEP contained contradictory information – his assessed reading and math \nproficiency was at the 1% level, despite “teacher observation” from the residential placement \nschool stating that he was capable of 70% achievement in both subject areas. His GAL requested \na  psycho-education  evaluation  for  Darnell  and  additional  testing  for  possible  learning \ndisabilities, but DCS never arranged for the testing. When she withdrew as his GAL in early \n14 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 14 of 82 PageID #: 183\n\n2021, DCS and Darnell’s residential placement promised to arrange for testing and have his \nschool update his IEP accordingly, but this never occurred. \n53.  Darnell’s former GAL is ready and willing to foster Darnell and possibly adopt \nhim. The GAL has known Darnell since 2018, has knowledge of his specific needs, and is eager \nto provide him with the necessary support. Six months after stepping down as his GAL, in 2021, \nDarnell’s former GAL completed foster parent training in order to foster Darnell. The former GAL \nwas in contact with Darnell’s DCS caseworker throughout this time, but the certification process \nfor her home was never completed. Darnell stated that he wanted a two-parent home and the former \nGAL requested that DCS and the service provider help Darnell adjust his expectations so he could \ncome and stay with her, but that did not occur. \n54.  In the fall of 2023, DCS placed Darnell in a pre-adoptive home where he stayed for \nonly six months. Prior to transferring him to this pre-adoptive home, DCS failed to have his school \nupdate the IEP with the information from the assessment. DCS also failed to inform the foster \nparents of Darnell’s behavioral and academic needs and falsely told them he was performing at \ngrade level and receiving all “A’s.” Darnell was placed in a traditional classroom for his grade, \nbut he was unable to perform the work because of the lack of necessary services. As a result, he \nstruggled with behavioral issues at the school and after just six months, the pre-adoptive parents \nrequested Darnell’s removal, citing a lack of information and support from DCS. \n55.  After removing Darnell from the pre-adoptive foster home, DCS again bounced \nDarnell around, this time to a Level 4 placement, then to short-term and respite placements, and \nfinally returned him to a Level 3 residential facility in May 2024, where he remains. This is in \ndirect contradiction of the 2022 psychological exam that recommended no residential facility \nplacements for Darnell. \n15 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 15 of 82 PageID #: 184\n\n56.  Neither the residential facility nor DCS have provided Darnell with consistent \naccess to hygiene products or clothing. During his first stay at this facility, his GAL offered to buy \nhim a Christmas present and asked what he wanted. The only thing Darnell wanted was his “own \ndeodorant stick.” \n57.  From 2021 to 2023 and over the past year, Darnell’s former GAL has provided him \nwith body wash, deodorant, moisturizer, and clothing because DCS and the facility failed to meet \nhis basic needs. \n58.   During his most recent residential stay, just two months after Darnell arrived at the \nLevel 3 facility, he was assessed as suitable to step down in care. One year later, he remains at the \nsame facility. \n59.  In February 2025, Darnell’s contract caseworker reported to the FCRB that Darnell \nwas ready to step down to a lower level of care. At that same meeting, Darnell told the FCRB that \nhe did not feel safe at the residential facility. The FCRB called DCS into the meeting to discuss \nthe issue; DCS failed to take any action.  \n60.  Darnell has since reiterated to both DCS and the juvenile court that he feels unsafe \nat the facility, yet DCS continues to keep him there, claiming it has nowhere else to place him.  \n61.  DCS has also failed to hold timely permanency meetings for Darnell. Although \nquarterly meetings are required, Darnell went almost one year between his most recent CFTM and \nthe CFTM prior.  \n62.  In late 2024, the former GAL again went through foster parents training in order to \nfoster Darnell. When the GAL began the process to be certified as a foster/pre-adoptive home, she \nreached out to DCS to request group counseling with Darnell to prepare for the possible transition. \nDCS never responded to her email. The former GAL has also repeatedly requested in-person visits \n16 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 16 of 82 PageID #: 185\n\nand home passes for Darnell, but other than one short in-person visit in May 2025, DCS and its \nservice provider have not responded to those requests either. The GAL has completed all training, \nand the only remaining steps are in DCS’s hands. If DCS were to act promptly, she could be \ncertified as a foster parent within two weeks. She has repeatedly informed DCS that she is pursuing \nfoster parent certification solely to foster Darnell. \n63.  Instead of pursuing placement with the GAL, DCS has continued to post that \nDarnell is available for adoption on its public website, ignoring a viable, willing caregiver. \n64.  An impediment to stability for Darnell continues to be his lack of educational \nservices. In emails to DCS providers and contract caseworkers, Darnell’s former GAL has again \nrequested more testing and corrections to his IEP, but DCS has failed to pursue either. DCS did \nnot pursue a psycho-educational assessment, which is a required prerequisite for an IEP. DCS did \nnot ensure that Darnell had an independent educational surrogate parent during the IEP process, \nas required. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0520-01-09-.20. Instead, DCS allowed their contracted \nagency—the entity who would bear the expense of any special services needed—to illegally use \none of their employees as Darnell’s educational surrogate. \n65.  As a result, Darnell’s most recent IEP, issued in late May 2025, is as incomplete, \nincorrect, and self-contradictory as the IEP which contributed to the disruption from the pre-\nadoptive home in 2022. His assessed reading proficiency and math proficiencies remain in the \nsingle digits, yet according to his IEP, he will be expected to reach 70% achievement in grade-\nlevel classes. \n66.  As a direct result of DCS’s actions and failures to act, Darnell has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer profound harm. DCS unnecessarily segregated and continues to segregate \nDarnell in an institution. Further, DCS has ignored professional recommendations, failed to act on \n17 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 17 of 82 PageID #: 186\n\nDarnell’s repeated pleas for safety, and obstructed a potential placement with a qualified and \ndedicated caregiver. DCS’s continued failures harm Darnell by denying him the stable, nurturing \nhome he deserves and to which he is entitled, and by denying him the services he needs to succeed. \nJasmine G. \n67.  Plaintiff Jasmine G. (age 15) entered DCS custody at age 12 and remains in DCS \ncustody as of the date of this filing. DCS has subjected Jasmine to unnecessary physical, mental, \nand emotional harm by placing her in inappropriate institutional settings, failing to provide \nessential mental health care, and failing to ensure her basic needs are met. \n68.  Jasmine appears in this action through her next friend, Stacie Odeneal. Stacie \nOdeneal is Jasmine’s GAL and has been advocating in her best interest for years. She is very \nfamiliar with Jasmine’s history and is dedicated to her best interests. \n69.  DCS initially placed Jasmine, a child who had been trafficked by her biological \nmother, in a foster home with her sister, but failed to provide the intensive therapy necessary to \naddress her severe trauma. In September 2023, DCS sent Jasmine to an out-of-state residential \nfacility over 1,500 miles away due to the lack of appropriate in-state placements. The facility’s \nprogram  was  designed  as  a  six-month  residential  program,  but  Jasmine  has  now  been \ninstitutionalized there for over 18 months with no clear plan for transition. \n70.  The facility itself has repeatedly requested Jasmine’s removal, citing its inability to \nmeet her treatment needs, including a lack of specialized “attachment therapy” critical to her \nrecovery. Despite her GAL’s repeated requests, DCS has refused to move Jasmine to a more \nsuitable placement. Jasmine’s GAL again raised this issue at Jasmine’s permanency hearing in \nMarch 2025. \n18 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 18 of 82 PageID #: 187\n\n71.  Jasmine is prescribed psychiatric medications that are ineffective and have harmful \nside effects. Despite this, she has not received regular follow-up from medical staff, and her \nmedications have not been adjusted in over 18 months. DCS has failed to follow its own procedures \nrequiring regular assessment of treatment goals and symptom response. \n72.  Jasmine has not received consistent visits from an assigned caseworker during her \n18-month placement. Instead, DCS has sent various unassigned caseworkers with no relationship \nto Jasmine. The most recent Affidavit of Reasonable Efforts (a sworn statement documenting \nDCS’s efforts to reunify the family) from March 19, 2025, confirms that Jasmine had not been \nvisited by her assigned caseworker for 10 months, with only two face-to-face visits during that 12-\nmonth period, neither by her assigned caseworker. During this period, Jasmine has been reassigned \nto four different caseworkers, each of whom is unfamiliar with her case. \n73.  In December 2024, Jasmine’s facility again requested her removal following an \nincident. Jasmine packed all of her belongings in a garbage bag in anticipation, but DCS failed to \nretrieve her. A facility employee later threw away the bag containing all of Jasmine’s clothing. \nNeither the facility nor DCS replaced the clothing, with the exception of random items from a “lost \nand found.” \n74.  When Jasmine’s GAL recommended using Jasmine’s allowance to purchase new \nclothing, the facility stated Jasmine had no allowance, despite a state mandate of $2/day for all \nfoster children in residential care. DCS took no action, even after the GAL escalated the issue to \nDCS’s lead counsel in February 2025. DCS eventually issued a $250 clothing voucher in April \n2025—over two months later. \n19 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 19 of 82 PageID #: 188\n\n75.  Because she lacked appropriate clothing, Jasmine was unable to participate in \nequine therapy, a required component for program completion. Her GAL notified DCS of this \nbarrier, but DCS took no timely corrective action. \n76.  Although Jasmine is almost 16 years old and has a right to attend CFTMs to \nparticipate in planning her future, DCS has conducted at least 17 meetings without Jasmine \npresent. Jasmine reported to her GAL that she wants to attend CFTMs, but the facility has \nprevented her from doing so. DCS has never intervened to ensure that Jasmine attends these \nCFTMs. Prior to the most recent CFTM in February 2025, Jasmine’s GAL emailed the facility to \ninsist on Jasmine’s presence. Despite this email, the facility did not bring Jasmine to the meeting \nuntil the GAL refused to let the meeting commence in Jasmine’s absence. This is the first and only \ntime Jasmine has been able to attend a CFTM. \n77.  There is a family who wants to adopt Jasmine, but DCS has failed to take steps to \nimplement a plan for her transition to their home. Due to Jasmine’s untreated attachment issues, \nshe is afraid to be adopted by this family because she believes that if she opens herself to a \nrelationship with someone, that person will eventually turn on her and abandon her. Attachment \ntherapy is a form of psychotherapy specifically designed to help those with traumatic histories \ndevelop healthy relationships. Had DCS provided attachment therapy to Jasmine, it is likely that \nshe would have been able to join this family that wants her and experience a stable, supportive \nfamily and community where she could thrive. \n78.  As a direct result of DCS’s failures, Jasmine has suffered and continues to suffer \nphysical, mental, and emotional harm. She has been warehoused in an inappropriate institutional \nfacility without necessary therapeutic services or basic support. DCS continues to harm Jasmine \nby failing to act on well-documented deficiencies, neglecting to provide critical services, and \n20 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 20 of 82 PageID #: 189\n\ndenying her the permanency and stability she could achieve in a home with a family ready to \nwelcome her.  \nAmara and Zane G. \n79.  Plaintiffs Amara G. (age 9) and Zane G. (age 8) are siblings who have been in DCS \ncustody since 2017 and remain in DCS custody as of the date of this filing. DCS has subjected \nboth children to unnecessary emotional, psychological, and behavioral harm by failing to provide \nsafe and stable placements, depriving them of timely and consistent therapeutic services, and \ndenying them a path to permanency and ongoing sibling contact. \n80.  Amara and Zane appear in this action through their next friend, Darlene Vastano. \nDarlene Vastano is and has been the CASA for Amara and Zane G. since 2017. In that role, she \nhas known Amara and Zane G. and has been advocating in their best interest for approximately \neight years. She is very familiar with Amara and Zane’s history and is dedicated to their best \ninterests.  \n81.  Amara and Zane entered foster care at ages two and one, respectively, after being \nremoved from their biological mother’s care due to neglect. Their mother was regularly using \ndrugs  and  would  leave  the  children  for  long  periods  of  time,  including  during  periods  of \nincarceration. The children were ultimately removed after Amara was physically abused in the \nhome by a third party. DCS concluded that the mother failed to adequately supervise the children \nand thereby enabled the abuse. \n82.  DCS initially placed the children with an older, licensed foster parent who was \nknown to them. That placement lasted about a year, but the foster parent ultimately decided she \nwas not prepared to adopt. The children were then placed in a pre-adoptive foster home, which \ndisrupted after the foster parents separated. After removal, DCS learned that the children had been \n21 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 21 of 82 PageID #: 190\n\nabused in the home. Although DCS conducted an internal investigation, it never disclosed the \nresults. While in that same home, Amara was also sexually abused at daycare. \n83.  Around the end of 2022, the court terminated the biological mother’s parental \nrights. At the same time, Amara’s and Zane’s placement disrupted, and both children began \ndisplaying  significant  behavioral  challenges.  Amara  became  physically  aggressive  and \ndysregulated.  Zane,  who  has  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (“PTSD”)  and  symptoms  of \noppositional defiant disorder, began acting out aggressively and was hospitalized multiple times \nfor self-harm by age six. He also engaged in defiant behaviors, such as intentional soiling. DCS \nassessed Zane as needing a Level 3 foster home, while Amara required a lower level of care. DCS \nseparated the siblings, placing Amara back with the initial foster parent, who refused to take Zane. \n84.  Both children have experienced chronic delays and gaps in therapeutic care. Zane \nfrequently went without therapy due to placement instability. Amara went without therapy for six \nmonths to a year because her school failed to provide it; DCS did not provide it either. During \ntransitions, neither child received continuity of services, and weeks or months often passed without \ncare. Although sibling therapy was recommended, DCS never arranged it. \n85.  From March to October 2023, Zane had no long-term placement. Though DCS \nclaimed it was seeking a Level 3 home for him, Zane instead cycled through night-to-night foster \narrangements. During the day, he was sent to a temporary holding facility that grouped children of \ndifferent  ages  together.  Seven-year-old  Zane  was  placed  with  teenagers,  leading  to  further \ndeterioration in his mental health and behavior. \n86.  This unstable setup deprived Zane of any consistent caregiver exposed him to \ninappropriate peer interactions and left him isolated from his sister and any semblance of routine. \n22 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 22 of 82 PageID #: 191\n\nDuring this period, Zane received no therapy, and DCS failed to initiate new services in any of his \nplacements. The instability significantly escalated his behavioral challenges. \n87.  Although DCS stated that it was seeking a Level 3 placement for Zane, he never \nreceived one. In August 2023, he was briefly placed in a short-term setting before returning to \nnight-to-night care. For over a year, DCS placed Amara and Zane G. in separate, non-adoptive \nfoster homes. DCS placed Zane in a Level 1 foster home with a provider who was pressured to \naccept him despite being unlicensed for Level 3 care. The foster parent received little support from \nDCS and was not provided with needed respite care. \n88.  In March 2025, Amara and Zane were placed together in a pre-adoptive home, but \nthis placement only lasted approximately two weeks. After their brief placement together, Zane \nwas hospitalized and then discharged without a permanent placement. During the transition, there \nwere no services in place, and Zane received no education for several weeks. \n89.  Amara remains at the pre-adoptive home only until the end of the school year. \nAlthough the end of the school year is only a few weeks away, DCS does not have a placement \nplan for her either. \n90.  With the exception of two weeks in March 2025, Amara and Zane have now lived \napart for two years. Although DCS is required to facilitate sibling visits, none of the seven \ncaseworkers assigned to their case over the last eight years have arranged them. Their former foster \nparents from 2024 took it upon themselves to maintain the children’s sibling bond, but even that \nhas now been disrupted. \n91.  Despite court approval for a joint placement, Amara and Zane remain separated and \nhave no permanency plans. A standing court order requires DCS to demonstrate ongoing efforts \nto find Zane a suitable placement, but progress has stalled. \n23 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 23 of 82 PageID #: 192\n\n92.  As a direct result of DCS’s failures, including inappropriate placements, lack of \ntherapy, denial of sibling contact, and failure to achieve permanency, Amara and Zane have \nsuffered and continue to suffer significant emotional and behavioral harm. DCS’s inaction has \ndeepened their trauma, left their needs unmet, and denied them the security and stability that foster \ncare is meant to provide. \nAaron C., Arielle H., Ava C., Andrew C., and Adrian H. \n93.  Plaintiffs Aaron C. (age 9), Arielle H. (age 6), Ava C. (age 4), Andrew C. (age 2), \nand Adrian H. (age 1) (collectively, the “C/H Siblings”) have been in DCS custody since December \n2022 and remain in DCS custody as of the date of this filing. DCS has subjected the C/H Siblings \nto unnecessary physical, mental, and emotional harm by failing to provide required documentation, \nhealth coverage, therapy, and case management services—resulting in prolonged delays to medical \nand behavioral treatment and long-term developmental harm. \n94.  Aaron, Arielle, Ava, Andrew, and Adrian appear in this action through their next \nfriend, Trina Rogers. Trina Rogers is a friend of the kinship foster family where the children have \nresided for over two years. She is familiar with the C/H Siblings’ history and is dedicated to their \nbest interests. \n95.  The C/H Siblings came into DCS custody after a family member reported their \nabuse and neglect, including sexual abuse by their biological grandparents. DCS placed the C/H \nsiblings in a kinship foster placement with that family member in December 2022. Adrian H. was \nborn after the removal of his siblings and was placed with the same foster family as a newborn.  \n96.  When DCS brought Adrian H. to the family member, they did not inform her of the \nbaby’s condition. Adrian has a hole in his heart, did not (and still does not) eat by mouth, is \ndependent on a feeding tube, and has needed multiple surgeries. \n24 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 24 of 82 PageID #: 193\n\n97.  From December 2022 to March 2023, DCS placed the C/H Siblings with their \nfamily member but did not formalize the placement to make it an official placement. During this \nperiod, she was not given medical insurance for the children and did not have authority to seek \nmedical care on their behalf. Acting on her own initiative, she obtained medical cards from the \nchildren’s biological parents. When several of the children developed ear infections and Andrew \nsuffered an asthma attack, DCS did nothing to support her and she had to call numerous doctors \nbefore finding one who would treat the children. \n98.  Even after DCS formally placed the C/H siblings with their family member (now \ntheir foster mother) in March 2023, DCS still failed to provide essential documents, including the \nchildren’s birth certificates, Social Security cards, and proof of medical insurance coverage.  \n99.  Despite their foster mother’s repeated written requests to DCS officials, Ava’s and \nAndrew’s insurance lapsed in November 2023. DCS did not inform their foster mother of the lapse; \nshe only discovered it when Andrew needed urgent care for an ear infection. TennCare coverage \nwas not restored until August 2024, nearly nine months later, because DCS had failed to obtain \nthe birth certificates required for the application. \n100.  These delays in insurance coverage caused significant disruptions to their necessary \ncare.  Ava  could  not  attend  specialty  optometrist  appointments  and  was  unable  to  receive \noccupational therapy or dental care until TennCare was restored. Andrew missed occupational \ntherapy, speech therapy, hearing tests, and dental appointments. As a result of the lack of insurance, \nboth children’s learning was delayed, and they were only diagnosed with autism in January 2024. \n101.  Despite the children’s extensive trauma and need for therapeutic services, DCS \nfailed to arrange therapy. Their foster mother independently located a therapist for the children \nand paid out-of-pocket for their care because the therapist did not accept TennCare. DCS assured \n25 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 25 of 82 PageID #: 194\n\nher it would cover the therapist’s fees and also locate a provider within network, but it has done \nneither.  The  children  are  not  receiving  therapy  at  the  frequency  prescribed  by  medical \nprofessionals, as their foster mother cannot afford the ongoing costs. \n102.  Their foster mother discovered that Aaron was eligible to receive school counseling \nfrom an outside provider; however, DCS failed to complete the paperwork for months. Per policy, \nonly DCS could complete the paperwork, so Aaron’s counseling was consequently delayed. \n103.  DCS also delayed the C/H Siblings’ enrollment in the Strong Families program, \nwhich provides grants for children with special needs. Their foster mother discovered the program \non her own, but initial delays due to lack of insurance, and later, due to DCS’s failure to complete \nthe application paperwork, resulted in months of lost time. Though their foster mother provided \nthe required forms and contact information to the caseworker, he failed to complete them. The C/H \nSiblings ultimately received the grants only after a four-month delay caused by DCS’s inaction. \n104.  Since entering care in December 2022, the C/H Siblings have had four or five \ndifferent caseworkers. Many caseworker visits have been perfunctory. Caseworkers failed to \nexamine the condition of their foster home, did not speak to the children privately, and often were \nunfamiliar with the children or their case. Most visits were conducted by substitute caseworkers, \nrather than the assigned caseworker. Throughout these visits, their foster mother repeatedly \nrequested assistance in obtaining necessary documentation and health insurance, to no avail. \n105.  DCS also failed to hold required CFTMs for the C/H Siblings. CFTMs were only \nheld after the foster mother insisted on them, and DCS often allowed over seven months to lapse \nbetween meetings. \n106.  As a result of DCS’s ongoing failure to provide essential documentation, case \nplanning, health care, and services, the C/H Siblings have suffered and continue to suffer physical, \n26 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 26 of 82 PageID #: 195\n\nmental, and developmental harm. Delays in diagnosis and treatment have led to worsened medical \nconditions, including more invasive treatment than would have otherwise been necessary. DCS’s \nongoing refusal to provide therapy at the required frequency further harms the children’s well-\nbeing, leaving them without the support necessary to address their trauma and developmental \nneeds. \nZander M. \n107. Plaintiff Zander M. (age 15) has been in DCS custody since February 2015 and \nremains in DCS custody as of the date of this filing. DCS has subjected Zander to unnecessary \nphysical, mental, and emotional harm by placing him in unsafe and temporary placements where \nhe has been inappropriately restrained using unauthorized methods.  \n108. Zander appears in this action through his Next Friend, Marjorie Bristol. Marjorie \nBristol—a Tennessee attorney who has spent nearly three decades advocating for vulnerable \npopulations—practiced for four years as a GAL in foster cases, and spent over six years as lead \neducation attorney for DCS. Since 2017, she has maintained her own child-focused legal \npractice. Marjorie Bristol has acquainted herself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding \nZander’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his best interest. \n109. DCS placed Zander at Cumberland Primary Assessment Center (an assessment \nfacility on the Clover Bottom campus) for almost two months, from February 21, 2025, to April \n15, 2025.  \n110.  Although Clover Bottom houses children who have allegedly suffered parental \nabuse and/or neglect, the assessment facility is enclosed with razor-wire, and DCS permits staff to \nphysically restrain children. Zander was physically manhandled twice  over two months  for \nwalking towards a door which led to the razor-wire-enclosed yard.  \n27 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 27 of 82 PageID #: 196\n\n111.  On the first occasion, a male staff member forced Zander to a nearby couch. Once \nZander was lying on the couch, the male staff member climbed on top of him and pinned Zander \ndown with his body.  \n112.  The second time, the male staff member restraining Zander came exceedingly close \nto Zander’s genitals. Zander, who has a history of witnessing physical abuse between his parents, \nwas traumatized by this contact. Despite the seriousness of the allegation, DCS took no known \naction to investigate the conduct or ensure his safety. DCS failed to respond to Zander’s attorneys’ \nrequests for the incident reports; DCS also failed to respond to the grievances that Zander filed \nabout these two incidents. \n113.  Throughout his entire stay at Clover Bottom, DCS provided Zander with inedible \nfood served at unsafe temperatures. All food was cold, regardless of whether the food was \nsupposed to be warm. This, combined with the treatment by staff, harmed Zander to the point that \nhe was unable to defecate for weeks at a time. He filed daily grievances regarding the conditions \nand treatment at the facility, but again, he received no response. DCS also failed to respond to his \nattorneys’ requests for copies of the grievances.  \n114.  During his stay at Clover Bottom, Zander reported that his prescribed medications \nwere causing him troublesome side effects. Although Zander has voiced his complaints, he \ncontinues to be given these medications. DCS has taken no action to explore this issue or work \nwith medical professionals to adjust Zander’s medications. Instead, DCS workers inaccurately \nclaim that he refuses to take the medications. \n115.  DCS attempted to unnecessarily institutionalize Zander, based on their incorrect \nreports and their simultaneous failure to address Zander’s medical needs. At a recent meeting to \ndiscuss Zander’s long-term placement, DCS recommended a Level 3 (i.e., residential facility) \n28 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 28 of 82 PageID #: 197\n\nplacement due to Zander’s supposed medical “non-compliance.” Zander’s GAL was unable to \nrefute DCS’s inaccurate reports because DCS excluded her from the meeting after she asked to \nreschedule due to a conflict. \n116.  Zander requires special education services due to his intellectual disabilities and his \nmental health diagnoses. However, his IEP meeting was held before a psych assessment was \ncompleted, leading to inaccurate recommendations for his needs. While at Clover Bottom, DCS’s \nversion of “school” consisted solely of dispensing second-grade level worksheets to Zander, an \napproach that not only failed to meet his cognitive and academic needs but also demeaned him and \nworsened his mental health.  \n117.  While DCS pursued an inappropriate and harmful institutional placement, they \nignored a viable and appropriate  foster home  placement that  was interested in providing  a \nplacement for Zander. When Zander’s GAL provided DCS with the name of a family friend who \nwanted to foster Zander, DCS sat on this information for almost a full month before looking into \nthis possibility. Eventually, DCS approved the family friend, and Zander was placed with the \nfamily friend on April 15, 2025, but only after an unnecessarily lengthy and traumatic stay at \nClover Bottom. \n118.  As of the date of this filing, Zander remains in DCS custody. His current placement \nis with the family friend, but DCS has failed to implement any of the recommendations in Zander’s \npermanency plan. The family just had their first therapy session at the beginning of June 2025, and \nDCS has ignored requests for assistance in updating Zander’s IEP, has historically ignored requests \nto begin services with Zander’s mother so that the family can be safely reunified, and ignores his \nattorneys’ requests for documentation as to these steps. As a result, Zander is not getting the \nservices he needs, nor does he know where he will ultimately live. DCS’s failure to investigate \n29 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 29 of 82 PageID #: 198\n\nserious abuse allegations, to follow up on appropriate placements, and to provide necessary \neducational and mental health services has left Zander vulnerable, retraumatized, and without the \nsupport he needs to recover and succeed. \nDewayne W. \n119. Plaintiff Dewayne W. (age 15) has been in DCS custody since April 2022 after \ncoming into care through a Neglect and Dependency petition. In three years, DCS has sent \nDewayne to twelve placements, including multiple stays in temporary placement centers. DCS \nhas subjected Dewayne to unnecessary physical, mental, and emotional harm by placing him in \nfacilities with unsafe living conditions, inappropriately housing him in lockdown facilities, and \ndepriving him of his right to an appropriate education.  \n120. DCS policies advocate working toward reunification with biological parents where \nappropriate. However, DCS has failed to provide Dewayne’s mother with sufficient planning, \nservices, or support to enable reunification of the family for over two years. His biological \nmother was unaware that her counsel had been relieved and therefore was unable to meaningfully \nparticipate in the proceedings, nor was she counseled on how to meet her requirements. DCS \nclaimed that his mother had failed to meet her duties needed to work towards reunification and \nshuffled  Dewayne  from  placement  to  placement  without  setting  up  meaningful  visitation \nbetween Dewayne and his family. It was not until this was brought to the attention of the parties \ninvolved that she was appointed an attorney and began to receive the clarity, guidance, and \nservices she needed. During this period, DCS’s permanency plan for Dewayne was bare-bones \nand unhelpful.  \n121. Although DCS states that transitional and assessment placements are short-term \nplacements for children awaiting foster placement, DCS housed Dewayne in these facilities for \n30 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 30 of 82 PageID #: 199\n\nalmost three months. From January 30, 2025, to April 25, 2025, he was passed back and forth \nbetween transitional housing and an assessment center. His FSW admitted and documented that \nno placement packets had been sent to any agency in an effort to find Dewayne a permanent \nplacement. It was not until his Guardian ad Litem filed a Motion bringing this to the attention of \nthe Court that packets were sent by DCS to Network Development, the section of DCS in charge \nof placements, in March 2025. \n122. DCS has failed to keep accurate records of Dewayne. This was most evident when \nDCS reported to the court in March that Dewayne had been a runaway since January, apparently \nbecause that is what their records indicated. However, DCS should have known that and reported \nthat Dewayne had been staying in DCS’ Transitional Housing for over five weeks, had been in \nconsistent and constant communication with his FSW, and had been present at each and every \ncourt appearance and DCS appointment.  \n123. Dewayne spent months at the transitional placement Resource Linkage, which used \nto be the Tennessee Preparatory School campus (“TPS”). TPS, which functioned essentially as \nan orphanage, was shut down under Brian A. in part due to environmental concerns, such as the \nnon-potable water in the faucets. DCS re-opened this campus as transitional housing without \naddressing the safety issues which caused its closure. Dewayne’s room at this placement had \nlarge holes in the wall, no curtains, an air mattress as his bed, minimal linens, no door, dirty \nfloors, graffiti and other marks on the walls, no furniture (his belongings were in garbage bags), \nand minimal supervision.  \n124. Between January 30 and February 28, 2025, Dewayne lived at Resource Linkage. \nHe was wrongfully expelled from school on January 30, 2025. The expulsion was later modified \nto allow him to return after spring break. While a student is serving an expulsion, they are to be \n31 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 31 of 82 PageID #: 200\n\neducated at an Alternative Learning Center (ALC); DCS failed to enroll him in the ALC. Instead \nthey sent his mother to try to register him, even though she did not have custody and was \ntherefore not legally permitted to do so. As a result, Dewayne missed school entirely from \nJanuary 30 through March 17, 2025. By being out of school this long, he did not receive any of \nthe services provided in his IEP, which has impacted his academic growth.  \n125. On February 28, 2025, DCS moved Dewayne to an assessment center. While in \nassessment centers children are unenrolled from their school and are supposed to be provided \nwith education on the premises. Dewayne was placed in a restrictive lockdown setting, enclosed \nby razor-wire. Because DCS said they needed to “fix up” the original transitional housing he was \nin and alleged he needed assessments. DCS was aware that Dewayne had an appointment three \ndays  later  for  a  full  psychological  evaluation.  DCS  had  not  previously  said  he  needed \nassessments  during  the  month  he  languished  at  Resource  Linkage  without  any  access  to \neducation or mental health treatment.  \n126. Since returning to transitional placement on the TPS campus, DCS has consistently \ninterfered with Dewayne’s education. DCS, who is responsible for transporting Dewayne to \nschool, regularly drops him off late. Because the driver changes daily, there is no consistent \nroutine, and so Dewayne arrives late almost daily and misses vital instruction. His school district \nhas tardiness policies that require them to give him in-school suspension (ISS) after a certain \nnumber of tardies. The diligence, determination, and advocacy of his IEP team and other \nstakeholders is the only reason ISS was avoided. Not only is DCS placing Dewayne at risk for \nISS, but their actions resulted in direct interference with his education. Dewayne remains at risk \nof falling further behind, and the state has offered no plan to remediate the harm caused by weeks \nof missed education or to ensure that his specialized services resume.  \n32 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 32 of 82 PageID #: 201\n\n127. As a direct result of DCS’s failures, Dewayne has suffered and continues to suffer \nharm. DCS has kept Dewayne in unsafe, unsanitary and unhealthy placements, continually \nretraumatized him with unnecessarily harsh placements, and allowed him to languish in foster \ncare for years instead of providing the reasonable efforts appropriate to facilitate reunification \nwith his biological family and community. Further, DCS has failed to provide Dewayne with the \nnecessary mental health services and educational services necessary for his safety and well-\nbeing. Since his mother’s legal representation resumed, she has exceeded the requirements of \nher Permanency Plan and Dewayne was finally sent home on a 90-day trial home visit. Despite \nthis movement towards permanency, his path to returning to the custody of his mother remains \nobstructed by DCS’s administrative errors, failure to provide timely services, and indifference \nto his well-being. Further, this three-year separation from his family and community has caused \ntrauma that will not be easily remedied. \nMax W. \n128.  Max W. (age 16) entered DCS custody in April 2024 and remains in DCS custody \nas of the date of this filing. In the one year since entering care, DCS has subjected Max to \nunnecessary physical, mental, and emotional harm by repeatedly placing him in unstable and \ninappropriate placements, denying him access to education, and failing to provide necessary \ntherapeutic and disability-related support. \n129.  Max appears in this action through his next friend, Sherry Taylor. While on staff at \nCASA, Sherry Taylor was the Team Lead for the volunteer assigned to Max; in that role, Ms. \nTaylor visited Max regularly and advocated on his behalf in CFTMs and court hearings. She is \nvery familiar with Max’s history and is dedicated to his best interests.  \n33 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 33 of 82 PageID #: 202\n\n130.  Max came into DCS custody because he was spending most of his life in the streets \ndue to his grandmother’s inability to care for him, leading to a determination of neglect. \n131.  Max has intellectual disabilities, and he suffers from depression and  suicidal \nideation. In June 2024, Max was suicidal and required intervention; his CASA advocate asked his \nDCS social worker to take him to the hospital for treatment, but the social worker replied that it \nwas “not [her] job.” \n132.  In the past year, Max has been in five placements. \n133.  DCS first placed Max at Resource Linkage, a transitional placement, apparently \ndue to a lack of appropriate foster homes suited to his needs, where DCS kept him for two months \nbefore sending him to a residential facility. \n134.  The facility did not have any teachers for several weeks after their teacher left in \nJuly 2024, nor did they provide any alternative education. Max did not receive any education \nduring this time.  \n135.  The  teacher  hired  in  August  2024  verbally  abused  Max  for  his  intellectual \ndisabilities. On one occasion, the teacher mocked Max to his face as being “slow.” \n136.   In Max’s discharge planning from the residential facility, DCS determined that \nMax required a therapeutic foster home. His team was told that he should be the only child in the \nhome. \n137.  Despite the recommendation, in December 2024, DCS placed Max in a non-\ntherapeutic foster home with caregivers who lacked any relevant training. Just three days after \nplacement, DCS violated its own recommendation by placing another child in the home long-term \nand placing an additional child there for “respite” stays, undermining the stability and support Max \n34 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 34 of 82 PageID #: 203\n\nrequired. The foster parents, overwhelmed and unprepared, requested Max’s removal after less \nthan three months. \n138. In March 2025, DCS next moved Max to a Disability and Intellectual Disability \nSupport (“DIDS”) residential facility. While there, the staff called the police on Max for taking \nthe group landline telephone into his room. Despite Max’s disabilities, staff subjected him to \npolice interrogation and pressured him to “confess.” When Max asked to remain silent, staff had \nhim arrested for being “unruly.” Max was detained for the weekend, was never charged with a \ncrime other than being “unruly,” which is not a detainable offense. \n139.  The staff at the DIDS facility continued to frequently call the police on Max over \nsimilar, non-criminal behavior.  \n140.   The home manager at the DIDS facility locked Max out of the home and called the \npolice on him. Max was so distraught that he was actively attempting to cut his wrists when first \nresponders arrived; an EMT had to remove the cutting object from Max’s hands to prevent further \nself-harm. \n141.  Not long after this incident, Max disclosed to his CASA advocate that he was \nexperiencing suicidal ideation. Facility staff delayed calling 911 on Max’s behalf, stating that the \nhouse manager’s permission was needed to do so. The facility did not call 911 until the DCS team \nleader intervened, despite repeated requests by Max’s CASA advocate.  \n142. Max indicated that his psychotropic medications caused severe side effects and \nmood disruptions; nevertheless, the facility increased the dosages twice within the span of one \nmonth. The first increase, in early April 2025, doubled the prior dosage. DCS has taken no action \nto alleviate Max’s suffering, leading to a May 2025 court order for Max to be seen by a medical \nprovider. \n35 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 35 of 82 PageID #: 204\n\n143. DCS failed and continues to fail to take any action against the residential facility \nfor their mistreatment of Max. DCS left Max at this same facility until the end of May \n2025.When DCS finally removed Max from the facility, they did so without holding a CFTM \nand without notifying his team. DCS placed Max at a Level 2 facility, despite his assessment \nrecommendation for a Level 3 facility. \n144.  As a result of DCS’s failures, Max has suffered and continues to suffer physical, \nemotional and psychological harm. DCS has destabilized him by moving him from place to place; \ndespite this frequent movement, DCS is unable or unwilling to place Max in a safe home with \nservices appropriate to his needs. DCS has knowingly deprived Max of his right to safety and \nproper medical treatment while in its care and subjects him to caregivers who abuse him. \nThomas H.  \n145.  Thomas H (age 13) has been in DCS custody for five years. His parents’ rights were \nterminated on April 13, 2022, and DCS currently has full guardianship over Thomas. He has been \nin multiple placements over these 5 years. DCS has failed to provide Thomas with appropriate \nhealth care, subjected him to physical and emotional harm by failing to provide safe and stable \nplacements, denied him ongoing sibling contact, and deprived him of his right to an education.  \n146.  Thomas appears in this action through his next friend, Tia Bailiff. Ms. Bailiff is \nThomas’ GAL and has been advocating in his best interest for years. She is very familiar with \nThomas’ history and is dedicated to his best interest.  \n147.  Thomas has significant mental health issues, which DCS has continually refused to \naddress adequately. He has documented auditory and visual hallucinations, and he has attempted \nto harm others. \n36 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 36 of 82 PageID #: 205\n\n148.  Thomas has begged DCS to place him at a residential facility because it is the only \nplace where he has access to the level of medication and treatment necessary to address his mental \nhealth issues. He has begged DCS for a residential placement because it is “the only thing that \nmade the bad man stop.” Dr. Boiter, the DCS doctor responsible for residential placements for \nfoster children in Thomas’ region, has never treated Thomas, despite requests from Thomas’ GAL \nand next friend. Nevertheless, Dr. Boiter decided that residential placement was not appropriate \nfor Thomas.  \n149.  DCS completed a Child and Adolescent Needs and Strength (“CANS”) assessment \non Thomas that was full of misinformation that DCS long refused to rectify. Thomas’ biological \nmother severely sexually abused Thomas, and the termination of parental rights petition listed \nsexual abuse as the reason for termination; however, Thomas’ CANS assessment stated that \nThomas has not suffered sexual abuse. Thomas has a no-contact order against his biological mother \ndue to the sexual abuse, but the information in the CANS listed her as a “great support.” The CANS \nalso stated that the biological mother was participating in services, but in reality, she has been \nmissing for more than a year. Despite multiple requests from Thomas’ GAL and next friend to \nupdate his CANS, she does not know if these errors have been rectified. \n150.  Thomas receives services through Youth Villages, a privately contracted provider \nwith DCS. About 2.5 years ago, Thomas’ then-foster mother asked Youth Villages to re-do \nThomas’ safety plan because it was not effective; while on this plan, Thomas hurt himself, another \nperson, and an animal. Youth Villages, however, refused to re-evaluate the safety plan. Youth \nVillages did increase Thomas’ weekly counseling services from once to twice a week for a period, \nbut these counselling sessions often consisted of little more than worksheets for Thomas to \ncomplete.  \n37 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 37 of 82 PageID #: 206\n\n151.  In approximately June 2021, Thomas’ then-foster mother sent him to an acute care \nfacility after an incident where Thomas’ hallucinations posed a threat to himself and those around \nhim. Youth Villages admonished the foster mother because the acute care facility was not a Youth \nVillages facility. When Thomas returned to the foster home, he started screaming when the \ntherapist began to leave. The foster mother, following Youth Villages’ own protocols, called Youth \nVillages for aid. A Youth Villages therapist came to the home to attempt de-escalation but without \nsuccess. After trying “the five coping mechanisms,” the therapist said that she would call a \nsupervisor. The supervisor told the therapist to try “the five coping mechanisms”; meanwhile, \nThomas had progressed to punching himself in the face. GAL and Next Friend Bailiff got involved \nwith the phone calls to Youth Villages after the call with the supervisor. On the fourth call with \nsupervisors, GAL and Next Friend Bailiff told the Youth Villages supervisor and foster mother \nthat she was going to file a neglect/abuse petition if the foster mother did not call 911; Youth \nVillages continued to protest any acute intervention, claiming that this was not part of the safety \nplan. The foster mother, fearing for Thomas’ safety, called 911 at the GAL’s instruction. Shortly \nafter this incident, DCS removed Thomas from the foster mother’s care, who has since adopted \nThomas’ biological sibling.  \n152.  Since removing Thomas from the foster mother’s care, DCS has shuffled Thomas \nbetween at least five placements where he has suffered inadequate and unsafe housing. DCS has \nkept him in non-residential office spaces where he had to sleep on the floor. DCS also placed him \nin unsafe placements where he has reported physical and sexual abuse by other children to adults \naround him.  \n153.  In one placement during the 2024-2025 school year, Thomas refused to leave his \nschool at the end of the school day after informing an adult employee at Youth Villages about \n38 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 38 of 82 PageID #: 207\n\nabuse he experienced in his placement. That Youth Villages employee then called Thomas’ former \nfoster mother, who was still in close contact with Thomas, to ask her to convince him to return to \nthe placement because Youth Villages did not have an alternative location for Thomas at the time. \nThomas’ former foster mother refused to suggest to Thomas that he return to a house where he felt \nunsafe. After Thomas’ former foster mother submitted an anonymous child abuse complaint on \nhis behalf about these issues, DCS and Youth Villages has limited Thomas’ ability to speak with \nher or his biological sibling over the phone. \n154.  Thomas has made at least two complaints of sexual assault in his current placement \nto adults and through calls to his caseworker. After his second complaint, Thomas briefly ran away \nfrom the facility in an attempt to escape this abuse. As of the time of this filing, he remains in the \nsame placement.  \n155.  DCS has also deprived Thomas of his educational rights. In a call to his former \nfoster parent in May 2025, he said that he had not received any schooling for approximately three \nmonths.  \n156.  As a direct result of DCS’s actions and failures to act, Thomas has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer physical, mental, and emotional harm. DCS has refused to properly medicate \nor treat Thomas’ mental health issues. These harms are compounded by DCS’s repeated failure to \nprovide Thomas with safe housing or educational opportunities, or appropriately act on his \nallegations of abuse, all of which have harmed Thomas’ wellbeing and his ability to grow and \nthrive.  \nJonah W., Sarah W., Adam D., Alice W., and Gavin W. \n157. Plaintiffs Jonah W. (age 10), Sarah W. (age 9), Adam D. (age 8), Alice W. (age 6), \nand Gavin W. (age 4) are siblings who entered DCS custody on April 12, 2022, and remain in \n39 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 39 of 82 PageID #: 208\n\nDCS custody as of the date of this filing. While in DCS custody, DCS has subjected these \nchildren to unnecessary emotional and psychological harm by failing to provide essential trauma-\ninformed therapeutic services, denying them placement stability, and delaying their path to \npermanency. \n158. The children were taken into custody after police discovered them in a car with \ntheir parents, who were arrested after being found in possession of loaded meth syringes within \nthe children’s reach. The children were filthy, with feces running down their legs. After removal, \nDCS initially opened the case in Robertson County, but transferred it to Sumner County on May \n27, 2022, due to a prior case there. Over the following five months, DCS cycled the children \nthrough unknown numbers of temporary placements—the exact number remains unknown \nbecause DCS does not track temporary placements. Despite repeated inquiries, DCS failed to \ninform the children’s GAL of their location until December 2022. \n159. All five children have been diagnosed with a need for trauma therapy due to the \nabuse and neglect they experienced in their biological home, but none of them have received \nindividualized trauma-informed therapy. Instead, a school program called Cornerstone provided \nlimited group sessions to the three older children. These sessions did not address their trauma or \nprovide individualized support. DCS subsequently discontinued the program for two of the \nchildren without offering any replacement services. The two youngest children have received no \ntherapy at all because DCS lacks play therapy services. As of the time of this filing, none of the \nchildren are recommended for ongoing therapy despite their diagnoses because, according to \ntheir caseworker, the children are well adjusted and do not need additional services. \n40 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 40 of 82 PageID #: 209\n\n160. As a result of DCS’s repeated failures, the family court issued findings of no \nreasonable efforts by DCS on April 23, 2024, and again on June 11, 2024. A third motion was \nfiled by the children’s GAL on January 3, 2025. \n161. Throughout their 29 months in foster care, the children have had at least six \ndifferent  caseworkers—including four in the past year alone. DCS’s petition to terminate \nparental rights, filed in February 2025, remains pending due to DCS’s refusal to provide \ndiscovery to the children’s attorney, leaving these young children still far from achieving the \npermanence and stability to which they are legally entitled. \n162. As a direct result of DCS’s actions and omissions, Jonah, Sarah, Adam, Alice, and \nGavin have suffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. DCS has failed \nto meet even minimal professional standards by neglecting to provide trauma-informed services, \nfailing to track placements, failing to keep their GAL informed, and failing to act with urgency \nto secure them a permanent home. These children remain in limbo, traumatized, underserved, \nand without the stability every child deserves. \nII. Defendants \n163.  Defendant Margie Quin is the Commissioner of DCS. As such, Commissioner Quin \nis directly responsible for, and has direct control over, whether DCS provides constitutionally and \nstatutorily adequate services to the Named Plaintiffs herein and the putative class of foster children \nthey seek to represent. Commissioner Quin is sued in her official capacity. \n164.  Defendant Carla Aaron is the Deputy Commissioner of Child Safety for DCS. \nDeputy Commissioner Aaron is responsible for overseeing the Office of Child Safety of DCS. As \nsuch, Deputy Commissioner Aaron is directly responsible for, and has direct control over, whether \nDCS provides constitutionally and statutorily adequate services to the Named Plaintiffs herein and \n41 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 41 of 82 PageID #: 210\n\nthe putative class of foster children they seek to represent. Deputy Commissioner Aaron is sued in \nher official capacity.  \n165.  Defendant Karen Jointer Bryant is the Deputy Commissioner of Child Programs \nfor DCS. Deputy Commissioner Jointer Bryant is responsible for overseeing the Office of Child \nPrograms for DCS. As such, Deputy Commissioner Jointer Bryant is directly responsible for, and \nhas direct control over, whether DCS provides constitutionally and statutorily adequate services to \nthe Named Plaintiffs herein and the putative class of foster children they seek to represent. Deputy \nCommissioner Jointer Bryant is sued in her official capacity. \n \nDCS’S WIDESPREAD AND SYSTEMATIC VIOLATION OF CHILDREN’S RIGHTS \nI.  The Role of DCS \n166.  DCS is the state agency in Tennessee responsible for overseeing child welfare, yet \nit has consistently failed to uphold its duty to protect the vulnerable children in its care. DCS is \ncharged with five overarching missions: (1) protect children from abuse, mistreatment, or neglect; \n(2) provide prevention, early intervention, rehabilitative and educational services; (3) pursue \nappropriate and effective behavioral and mental health treatment; (4) ensure that health care needs, \nboth preventative and practical, are met; and (5) keep children safe. Tenn Code Ann. § 37-5-102. \nDCS fails on all five counts. DCS’s foster care system and child protective services are plagued \nby systemic failures that cause foster children physical and psychological harm, leave them \nwithout stability in their home life and community, and deprive them of necessary treatment and \nservices. DCS leaves children to languish in their deeply flawed foster system for years without a \nclear path to a permanent home.  \n \n42 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 42 of 82 PageID #: 211\n\nA.  Comptroller Audits Reveal Persistent Failures in Tennessee’s Child Welfare \nSystem \n \n167.  The Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury conducts audits and oversight of state \nagencies, including DCS. Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-29-111. Since 1997, the Comptroller’s Office has \nconducted multiple Performance Audit Reports of DCS. In its most recent audit of DCS in 2022, \nthe Comptroller found that “[t]he Department of Children’s Services is struggling to provide \nsupport services to Tennessee’s most vulnerable children and youth.”  \n168.  The  audit  revealed  a  consistent  pattern  of  DCS’s  failure  to  address  critical \ndeficiencies in child welfare despite repeated findings, recommendations, and calls for reform. \nDespite the identification of severe and pervasive problems in prior audits (most recently in 2016 \nand 2019), the 2022 Comptroller’s audit “found that DCS did not assess risks or develop controls \nin several areas that we have both previously reported and found in the current audit.” \n169.  The Comptroller identified four major, recurring issues which they had identified \nin multiple reports going back several years, and which DCS has made no efforts to fix. Case \nmanager turnover and staffing shortages have worsened over time, with high turnover rates and \nunmanageable caseloads leading to delays in child protection, investigations, and placements. By \n2022, the staffing crisis had reached a breaking point, severely hindering DCS’s ability to meet its \nobligations to children in state custody. \n170.  Additionally, child placements and institutionalization have remained significant \nconcerns. As early as 2016, audit reports warned of a lack of appropriate placements for children \nwith complex needs, leading to an over-reliance on institutional care. The 2019 audit report \nreinforced these concerns, noting a shortage of long-term, family-like placement options. By 2022, \nthe situation had become dire, with DCS housing children in state office buildings and sending \nthem out of state due to a severe shortage of foster homes and therapeutic placements. \n43 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 43 of 82 PageID #: 212\n\n171.  The audits have also repeatedly flagged DCS’s inadequate response to child safety \nand  abuse  investigations.  In  2019,  audit  reports  documented  oversight  failures  in  handling \nallegations  of  abuse  and  neglect.  By  2022,  these  deficiencies  had  escalated,  with  children \nremaining in unsafe environments due to DCS’s failure to meet investigation timelines.  \n172.  At that point, the audit showed that DCS lacked a consistent process for responding \nto allegations of sexual abuse and harassment within residential facilities, putting vulnerable \nchildren at increased risk of harm. \n173.  Finally, persistent failures in case management and data tracking have plagued DCS \noperations. By 2022, TFACTS, the agency’s case management system, had become a major barrier \nto efficiency, with the Comptroller finding that outdated technology caused delays in placement \ndecisions, financial processing, and case tracking. \n174.  Although DCS put into place some improvements during the years the Brian A. \nreforms  were  required,  the  audits  show  that  the  steps  toward  these  reforms  were  not \ninstitutionalized and were abandoned with the termination of the Brian A. case.  \nII.  Safety in Placements \n175.  Risk and safety assessments identify pending dangers or threats regarding a child; \nafter dangers are identified, workable safety plans ensure that a child can remain with a family in \na safe and stable way. Where identified risks cannot be mitigated by safety plans or where the \nfamily caring for the child is unable to fulfill the requirements of a safety plan, the child can be \nmoved to a more appropriate home or other location that can meet his/her needs. It is critical for \ncaseworkers to conduct timely and accurate assessments on an ongoing basis and to monitor the \nexecution of safety plans. The Administration for Children and Families, an office within the U.S. \n44 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 44 of 82 PageID #: 213\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, audits every state’s performance in this area and other \ncritical metrics of child welfare via Child and Family Service Reviews (“CFSRs”).  \n176.  In the most recent CFSR for Tennessee from 2024, DCS only conducted adequate \nrisk and safety assessment and management in 50% of foster cases reviewed, an alarming statistic \nthat demonstrates a failure to ensure proper placements and to protect children from harm.  \n177.  Tennessee does not track foster homes disqualified due to background checks on a \nstatewide basis, nor does it have an accurate statewide system that would allow it to do so, leaving \nthe potential for prospective foster families, turned down in one county, to go on to another county \nwithout addressing the issues rendering them unfit to foster. \n178.  DCS is responsible for ensuring the safety and well-being of foster children placed \nin residential facilities. However, repeated failures in oversight, investigation, and compliance with \nfederal standards have left children vulnerable to sexual abuse and neglect.  \n179.   According  to  DCS  policy,  their  Special  Investigations  Unit  is  supposed  to \ninvestigate all allegations of abuse or neglect of children in foster care; however, in 2021, DCS \ndid not investigate 34 out of 211 (16.1%) allegations of sexual abuse and/or sexual harassment \nwithin residential facilities.  Instead, DCS refers complaints about abuse in facilities to law \nenforcement to investigate. DCS does not track the referrals nor follow up with law enforcement \nto learn the results of the investigations. DCS does not conduct investigations nor referrals \nregarding sexual harassment complaints. \n180.  DCS also fails to investigate facilities for lack of supervision in connection with \nreports of sexual activity between children at residential facilities.  \n45 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 45 of 82 PageID #: 214\n\n181.  Further, DCS utilizes residential facilities that house both foster children and youth \ninvolved in the juvenile justice system, meaning that foster children are frequently placed in the \nsame settings as those involved with juvenile justice. \n182.  Of the sexual abuse investigations performed by DCS in 2021, 92% were not \ncompleted  within  the  required  time  frame.  On  average,  the  sampled  investigations  took \napproximately 50%-100% longer than allowed by DCS policy.  \n183.  DCS’s failure to investigate all allegations of sexual abuse and failure to conduct \nor complete their investigations timely puts children into the very danger that may have instigated \na child’s removal from their home. \n184.  DCS’s systemic failure to properly investigate allegations of sexual abuse and \nharassment in residential facilities perpetuates a dangerous environment for the children it is meant \nto protect.  \nIII.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Fuel Tennessee’s Placement Crisis \nA.  Placement Instability and Lack of Foster Homes \n185.  When children cannot remain safely in their own homes, DCS is responsible for \nproviding placements that meet their emotional, physical, and social needs. However, DCS’s \ninability to recruit and maintain available foster homes continues to present serious challenges to \nDCS’s ability to make appropriate placement decisions. Case managers frequently resort to placing \nchildren in temporary accommodations such as state office buildings or transitional facilities for \nextended durations. Compounding this issue, the case management system is ill-equipped to \ncapture real-time child placement data or track placement availability, creating negative impacts \nfor both children and DCS employees. \n46 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 46 of 82 PageID #: 215\n\n186.  Child welfare policy prioritizes placing children in foster care within family-like \nenvironments, ideally close to their home communities and, whenever possible, with kin caregivers \nand siblings. Providing stable and appropriate placements is essential to protecting children’s well-\nbeing and maintaining family bonds. However, due to a lack of adequately supported foster homes \nand specialized treatment programs, DCS often moves children frequently among various foster \nhomes, institutions, group settings, and other temporary or emergency placements. This shortage \nof foster homes has resulted in an overreliance on placements that fail to meet children’s needs, \nincluding unsafe or inappropriate congregate care facilities. \n187.  DCS’s placement system is based on a rotation of various on-call placement \nworkers from a shared group of multiple counties. Its use of this system often results in placement \nof children in the county where the on-call worker is assigned and familiar with the pool of foster \nparents rather than in a placement within their county of origin. This system unnecessarily \nseparates children from their natural community support, places barriers on therapy and visitation \nwith their family of origin, and causes unnecessary removals from their schools. For children with \nspecial education needs, this is especially disruptive.  \n188.  DCS has failed to maintain an adequate pool of foster and adoptive families, leaving \nchildren without stable placements and failing to ensure families reflect the racial and ethnic \ndiversity of those in need.  \n189.  DCS fails to properly support its foster families, particularly those foster families \nwho have high-needs foster children in their homes. DCS frequently places foster children with \nfoster parents who lack the training or experience necessary to support high-needs foster children. \nDCS often places these high-needs foster children in homes without ever informing the foster \nfamilies of the children’s needs. DCS then fails to provide the services to the child or the foster \n47 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 47 of 82 PageID #: 216\n\nfamily which might enable the family to provide a stable home and threatens retaliation against \nfamilies who request aid. As a result, foster parents often request removal of children they are not \nequipped to raise, foster parents close their homes to future foster children, and prospective foster \nparents are dissuaded from becoming certified foster homes. \n190.  Placement instability triggers a cascade of overlapping and compounding harms, \nincluding: (i) disruption of a child’s sense of security and attachment to caregivers; (ii) re-\ntraumatization by repeating the experience of removal; (iii) decreased chances of reunification and \nexiting care, along with an increased risk of re-entering care after reunification; (iv) interruptions \nin education; (v) loss of opportunities to build long-term relationships with supportive adults; (vi) \nheightened vulnerability to abuse and neglect; (vii) developmental delays or setbacks due to \ninconsistent caregiving and disrupted attachment; (viii) an increased likelihood of running away \nfrom  placements;  (ix)  interruptions  in  a  child’s  therapeutic  relationship  with  mental  health \nproviders and gaps in treatment; (x) worsening mental health symptoms; (xi) delays in diagnosis \nor access to mental health treatment; (xii) difficulties developing coping skills and adaptive \nbehaviors to manage stress and emotions; and (xiii) higher rates of juvenile delinquency and \ninstitutionalization. \n191.  According to a report by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth, in \n2022, Tennessee ranked number one in the nation for how often it moved foster children among \ndifferent placements. \n192.  In FY2023, 33% of children in the foster care system experienced instability, \nhaving been moved to three or more placements within a single year. This alarming trend is not \nlimited to children already in care. Among first-time foster children who entered the system in \n48 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 48 of 82 PageID #: 217\n\n2022, 38% had experienced three or more placements by December 31, 2023. For children entering \nin 2023, 31% had already experienced three placements by the end of the year. \nB.  Temporary Placements \n193.  Because DCS does not maintain enough appropriate placements, it houses children \nin unsuitable and temporary settings, including office buildings, hotels, hospitals, transitional \nhousing, “Isaiah” houses (run by independent non-profits), assessment centers, and Department of \nDisability  and  Aging  (“DDA”)  Supported  Living  Protocols  operated  by  rotating  caregivers \n(assessment centers for children with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities). Despite \nDefendant Quin’s assurances to state lawmakers that children were no longer sleeping in DCS \noffices except in Shelby County as of March 2023, records show that office stays resumed by \nNovember 2023 and continued into 2024. Contrary to her claims, nearly 100 children have spent \nnights in DCS offices this year. Children subjected to these placements frequently experience \nmonths of instability, living in conditions that lack basic necessities. DCS caseworkers say this is \na pattern, not an exception. DCS has no policies to ensure that these settings are adequately \nsupplied with food, toiletries, and other necessities. Because DCS has abdicated its responsibility \nto consistently provide these necessities, these sites are often supplied by community donations, \nresulting in varying levels of support.  \n194.  The Deputy Commissioner for Child Programs acknowledged that children are \noften forced to stay overnight in temporary settings because providers are unwilling to accept high-\nneeds children. Without proper placements, children requiring specialized care are left in limbo, \ncompounding their trauma and destabilizing their futures. \n \n49 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 49 of 82 PageID #: 218\n\ni.  Transitional Placements, Assessment Centers, and DDA Supported \nLiving Protocols \n195.  DCS uses a number of temporary placements, including transitional placements, \nassessment centers, “Isaiah Houses” (run by independent non-profits), DDA Supported Living \nProtocols, and intake centers. \n196.  According to DCS policy, children are placed in assessment centers for the purpose \nof assessing their needs. DCS policy limits the maximum length of stay in an assessment center to \n30 days. \n197.  Contrary to policy, most children placed in these assessment centers are there for \nfar longer than 30 days; it is rare that DCS and their contracted providers even complete the child’s \nassessment within 30 days.  \n198.  DCS subjects the children at assessment centers to draconian conditions more \ncommonly found in adult prisons. Intake centers are routinely staffed by personnel from the \nsheriff’s department. DCS is explicitly authorized to shackle children when they are taken off-site \nfor doctor’s appointments and other visits. Policies allow the use of chemical weapons, such as \npepper-spray, against children. DCS limits children’s in-person and telephonic communication and \nmonitors children’s calls, including calls to family and to their GALs. GALs have been prevented \nfrom seeing children they represent. One assessment center located at the Clover Bottom campus \nin Nashville is surrounded by barbed wire, which was installed only after DCS began using the \ncampus as an assessment center. \n199.  According  to  DCS  policy,  children  with  intellectual  and/or  developmental \ndisabilities are placed in DDA Supported Living Protocols for the purpose of assessing their needs. \nDCS policy limits the maximum length of stay in DDA Supported Living Protocols to 30 days.  \n50 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 50 of 82 PageID #: 219\n\n200.  DDA Supported Living Protocols are staffed by contract agencies that employ \nrotating hourly caseworkers that lack the specialized training and capabilities required to provide \nservices for children with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. Children placed in these \nhomes have very little supervision and support.  \n201.  Contrary to policy, children placed in these Supported Living Protocols are there \nfor far longer than 30 days; it is rare that DCS and their contracted providers even complete the \nchild’s assessment within 30 days. In spite of these children having known intellectual and/or \ndevelopmental disabilities, DCS fails to ensure their special educational needs are met, fails to \nprovide them with adequate services to support their disabilities, and fails to ensure they are \nreceiving services in the most integrated setting.  \n202.  The living conditions in many of the temporary placement buildings are dangerous. \nUpon information and belief, several buildings have holes in the walls and exposed electrical \nwiring. One of the three large centers in the state, Resource Linkage, is housed in a building that \nwas closed under Brian A., in part, due to lead in the water pipes. Signs above every water fountain \nand sink stated, “Non-potable water. Do not drink.” \n203.  The food provided at these temporary placements is inadequate and unhealthy. \nUpon information and belief, children are not fed regular and substantive meals. Many of the \nbuildings lack kitchen facilities; DCS feeds children only food that can be prepared in air-fryers \nor microwaves, such as chicken nuggets, French fries, or Hot Pockets. Breakfast often consists \nsolely of doughnuts.  \n204.  DCS creates dangerous situations by mixing children of varying ages, genders, and \nreasons for placement, and by mixing children with delinquency findings with children removed \nfrom their homes due to abuse or neglect. Children as young as seven years old are placed in spaces \n51 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 51 of 82 PageID #: 220\n\nwith teenagers. Boys and girls are often placed together, requiring shared bathrooms. Children \ncharged with violent criminal offenses are placed together with children removed from their homes \ndue to the trauma of inflicted violence; boys with rape and assault charges are placed together with \ngirls. \n205.  During  these  months-long  stays,  children  do  not  receive  treatment  for  their \nbehavioral/mental health needs. Upon information and belief, mental health professionals are \nrarely, if ever, in-house at the centers. Although in theory, DCS will drive children to the offices \nof mental health professionals, this rarely occurs in practice; many mental health professionals \nrefuse to work with DCS because of DCS’s track record of not paying the contracted rate for their \nservices. \nIV.  Permanency \n206.  The primary objective of foster care is to provide children with a temporary, secure, \nand nurturing environment, while their parents work to resolve the challenges that led to their \nseparation. When reunification is not an option, a foster care system must take prompt action to \nestablish permanency through adoption or guardianship, often with relatives. Ensuring stability is \nessential for a child’s emotional, educational, and social well-being, as extended time in foster care \ncan undermine their sense of security and lead to lasting negative effects. \n207.  DCS caseworker permanency plans are critical to a child’s progress out of the foster \nsystem. Permanency plans identify a permanency goal (e.g., reunification, adoption) and the steps \nneeded to achieve this goal. In the most recent CFSR report, appropriate permanency goals were \nonly rated as a strength in 36% of cases. Without consistent and timely oversight, children are left \nin a state of limbo, unable to achieve the permanency they need for long-term and mental health. \n52 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 52 of 82 PageID #: 221\n\n208.  Even when permanency goals are identified, DCS still causes children to languish \nin foster care unnecessarily. In 2022, children with a permanency goal of adoption, and whose \nparental rights have been terminated in furtherance of that goal, still waited 27.5 months on average \nbefore being adopted, over 8 months longer than the national average.  \nV.  Workloads and Staffing \n209.  Qualified caseworkers are vital to the administration of every child welfare system. \nThey are responsible for ensuring the safety, permanency, and well-being of children who are at \nrisk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. To carry out this critical task, they must assess the needs of \neach child and family, develop individualized plans to meet those needs, and monitor progress \ntoward achieving the desired outcomes. \n210.  Manageable  caseloads  are  necessary  to  the  provision  of  comprehensive  and \nindividualized services to each child and family in a caseworker’s care. Having a manageable \ncaseload requires few enough cases so that workers can take the time to build rapport, engage in \nmeaningful conversations, and identify the unique needs and strengths of each child and family. \nAdditionally, caseworkers must work collaboratively with other professionals and community \nresources to address complex issues and provide timely interventions. Without the capacity to \nperform these duties, caseworkers cannot ensure that foster children are safe, supported, and able \nto thrive in their families and communities. \n211.  When caseloads exceed reasonable professional standards, caseworkers are unable \nto devote the necessary time and attention to each child in their care. Additionally, overburdened \nworkers often experience burnout and high levels of stress, leading to turnover and a shortage of \nexperienced  workers.  High  turnover  increases  caseload  burdens  on  remaining  caseworkers, \nreduces productivity and morale, and increases feelings of hopelessness and frustration.  \n53 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 53 of 82 PageID #: 222\n\n212.  Caseworker turnover commonly results in delayed permanency for foster children. \nOne study found that foster children with one caseworker in a given year had an approximately \n75% chance of achieving permanency, those with two caseworkers had an approximately 18% \nchance of permanency, and those with more than three caseworkers had only a 2% chance of \npermanency.  \n213.  Caseworker turnover in Tennessee is high, with an average statewide turnover rate \nof 27%. One in four counties has a turnover rate higher than 40%. \n214.  While monitored pursuant to the Brian A. settlement, Tennessee achieved and \nmaintained an average caseload of 20 children per case manager in 2017, a standard that was \ncodified in Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-5-132.  \n215.  After DCS was released from Brian A.’s mandated oversight, caseloads quickly \nballooned. From 2020 to 2022, caseloads increased by 63%. Regional caseload averages rose to \nas much as double the statutory maximum, with over one-third (37%) of case managers carrying \nmore than the statutory maximum in May 2022. \n216.  In 2023, Defendant Quin announced a caseload maximum of ten cases per first-\nyear caseworker. Upon information and belief, that standard is not followed, and average caseloads \ndo not indicate how many individual workers are within that limit. Upon information and belief, \nnew caseworkers perform much of the workload for cases that are listed under supervisors’ names. \n217.  On March 4, 2024, Defendant Quin testified to the Tennessee House Government \nOperations Committee that Davidson County’s recent average caseload was fifty cases. She further \ntestified that the lowest average, after a “surge event” focused on closing cases, was twenty-nine \ncases. \n54 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 54 of 82 PageID #: 223\n\n218.  As a result, the amount of overtime for caseworkers has steadily risen. 80% of \ncaseworkers worked overtime in fiscal year 2022. Although about 15 hours of overtime per \ncaseworker was reported, DCS supervisors frequently requested that case managers not report their \novertime.  \n219.  In addition to overwhelming case responsibilities, caseworkers are required to work \novernight at transitional placements and office buildings where children are housed. Frequently, \nthis overnight shift is bookended with regular day shifts both before and afterward. \n220.  As a result of DCS’s practices, turnover and vacancy rates have skyrocketed. The \nannual case manager turnover rate rose from 15.5% in 2018 to 55.5% in 2022. In 2021, 97% of \ncase managers left DCS. Case manager vacancy rates rose from 6.5% in 2017 to 22% in 2022. \nVI.  Oversight Over Contracted Private Providers \n221.  DCS routinely contracts out their casework duties to the same private organizations \ncontracted to provide placements. Children who have a private agency caseworker frequently do \nnot have a worker from DCS. Upon information and belief, these private caseworkers do not \nreceive training in DCS policies or protocols, nor is there oversight by the public agency over the \nprivate caseworkers.  \n222.  Complaints about private casework and private provider employees are reviewed \nby the same private provider who employs them. Foster children, GALs, and other involved \nindividuals are frequently unable to reach anyone at DCS who is willing to claim responsibility \nfor overseeing contractors. Similarly, complaints of abuse at private facilities that house children \nin DCS custody are investigated by the same providers running those facilities. \n \n \n55 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 55 of 82 PageID #: 224\n\nVII.  Case Plans \n223.  DCS is required under federal law to provide children in foster care with a case plan \nthat is reviewed regularly, at least once every six months, until a child’s case is resolved and the \nchild leaves DCS custody. Federal law requires case plans to include a large amount of information \nabout the child and family, to identify necessary services and to focus on ways to resolve the case \nand support the foster child, including plans to effectively engage family members and services to \naddress the family’s and the child’s needs. In addition, the plans require ongoing monitoring by \nDCS to ensure that the child’s case is making progress toward its goals. \n224.  In recognition of the importance of timely, individualized, and appropriate case \nplans, the Brian A. settlement required DCS to hold CFTMs at least every three months; although \nDCS achieved this standard when monitored in 2016 and 2017, it has since fallen woefully short. \n225.  The 2024 CFSR, the most recent federal review of Tennessee’s child welfare \nsystem, found that periodic reviews of case plans were often not held in a timely manner. Upon \ninformation and belief, in some cases, CFTMs are held as little as once per year.  \n226.  The CFSR also found that case plans are generic, not individualized to the child’s \nneeds, and are not regularly updated to reflect changing circumstances. Of the case plans that exist, \nDCS only identifies appropriate permanency goals in 40% of sampled cases. Of the files sampled \nin the CFSR, children’s files lacked ongoing risk assessment in 50% of cases. 100% of cases \nsampled either did not have an ongoing risk assessment at all or had an incomplete risk assessment \nwhich only focused on pre-identified concerns instead of conducting a fresh assessment to discover \nareas of concern.  \n \n \n56 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 56 of 82 PageID #: 225\n\nVIII.  Unnecessary Use of Residential Placements \n \nA.  Insufficient Access to Community-Based Services for Children in DCS Care \nLeads to Increased Institutional Placement \n \n227.  Members of the ADA Subclass are “qualified individuals with disability[ies]” as \ndefined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), and its regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. A disability \nis “(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities \nof such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an \nimpairment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); 28 C.F.R. § 35.108. \n228.  Under the ADA, individuals with disabilities are entitled to receive goods, services, \nfacilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto their needs. An integrated setting is “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact \nwith nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. B. \n229.  DCS has failed to uphold this mandate by systematically and unnecessarily placing \nchildren with complex needs—particularly those with disabilities—in institutional settings rather \nthan in family-like, community-based placements where they receive home and community-based \nmental, physical, and behavioral health services.  \n230.  Similarly, DCS systematically places children with complex needs and disabilities \ninto unnecessarily restrictive institutional settings where a more integrated institutional level of \ncare or placement in a therapeutic foster home would be appropriate. \n231.  Case  managers  across  Tennessee  consistently  report  significant  challenges  in \nsecuring long-term, stable placements for children who require higher levels of care. In a recent \nbudget meeting, DCS data revealed a troubling trend: over the past four years, the Department has \nincreasingly relied on its most restrictive and costly services, while community-based options have \ndeclined.  \n57 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 57 of 82 PageID #: 226\n\n232.  Although DCS justifies this by claiming that necessary services are unavailable, \nthis reasoning ignores the Department’s legal obligation to develop services that enable children \nwith disabilities to receive care in the least restrictive, most integrated setting appropriate for their \nneeds, and to ensure that the services are adjusted so that children with disabilities can equally \nbenefit from those services. \n233.  Rather  than  investing  in  therapeutic  foster  care,  wraparound  services,  and \ncommunity-based treatment options, DCS has chosen to rely on segregated institutional settings, \ndepriving children of the opportunity to grow and develop in environments that promote family \nand community connections.  \n234.  Once placed in out-of-state or institutional settings, children are often left there long \nafter they could be safely transitioned to less restrictive environments. DCS has failed to take \nmeaningful steps to integrate these children back into their communities or ensure they receive the \nnecessary support to remain in family-like settings. \n235.  By  systematically  denying  children  access  to  appropriate  community-based \nservices and placements, DCS has violated its duty to ensure that children with disabilities receive \ncare in the most integrated setting possible. This failure represents a substantial departure from \nprofessional standards in child welfare and demonstrates deliberate indifference to the well-being \nof the children in its custody. \nB.  Lack of In-State Residential Placements \n236.  DCS is facing a critical shortage of in-state placements for children with complex \nmental health and behavioral needs, exacerbated by its failure to provide sufficient supportive \nservices to children in specialized, therapeutic foster homes.  \n58 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 58 of 82 PageID #: 227\n\n237.  DCS’s failure to anticipate and plan for the rising demand for more intensive and \nspecialized care has exacerbated the crisis, leaving some of Tennessee’s most vulnerable children \nwithout appropriate in-state treatment options.   \n238.  From January 2018 to July 2022, the number of children in DCS custody increased \nby 7%, yet DCS leadership failed to take sufficient action to prepare for a corresponding increase \nin the need for foster homes, treatment facilities, and secure residential placements. The Council \non Accreditation, which sets national best practice standards  for  child and family services, \nrecommends that agencies proactively recruit a diverse array of foster and treatment placements \nto ensure that children receive safe, consistent, and nurturing care. Tennessee’s failure to adhere \nto these recommended practices has contributed to the growing placement crisis, particularly for \nchildren requiring specialized treatment. \n239.  The severity of mental health issues among children in state custody has increased, \nyet Tennessee lacks the necessary infrastructure, resources, and trained foster families to meet \ntheir needs. Foster parents report that they do not receive adequate support or training to care for \nchildren with significant psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, or behavioral challenges.  \n240.  As a result, Tennessee sends an increasing number of children to out-of-state \nplacements, many of which also do not have appropriate programs to address the needs of children \nsent to them, and many of which have questionable programs and a shortage of appropriate \nstaffing. As of November 2024, DCS had more than 200 children in out-of-state institutions. These \nfacilities span 15 different states, including Alabama, Utah, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and South \nCarolina. \n59 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 59 of 82 PageID #: 228\n\n241.  Tennessee’s inability to provide in-state care for children with complex needs is a \ndirect result of poor planning, and a failure to develop sufficient residential and therapeutic foster \ncare resources. \n242.  DCS officials have acknowledged the urgent need for expanded residential capacity \nand more trained therapeutic foster homes. DCS has acknowledged the urgent need for more in-\nstate placement options and trained therapeutic foster homes, but its solution—the DCS Real \nEstate Plan—falls short. Instead of prioritizing community-based care, the plan relies on building \nor converting large, institutional facilities that do little more than warehouse children within state \nlines.  \nIX.  Lack of Education \n243.  The Tennessee Constitution affords all Tennessee children the right to an education. \nTenn. Const. Art. XI, § 12. Tennessee law affords all children with disabilities the right to a free \nand appropriate public education which includes the provision of “special education and related \nservices designed to meet the child’s unique needs.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-10-103. However, \nDCS routinely deprives children of education for weeks or months at a time. \n244.  DCS frequently moves children to night-to-night placements, bringing them to a \ndifferent location every night. During the day, DCS places these children at group centers such as \nResource Linkage. While bouncing these children from place to place, DCS either fails to enroll \nchildren in school or fails to transport children to their schools. Due to lack of placement \navailability, DCS keeps these children in placement limbo, without education for significant \nperiods of time. \n245.  DCS provides laptops for online schooling in some of their temporary placements; \nhowever, it does not provide the internet access necessary to connect to educational lessons and \n60 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 60 of 82 PageID #: 229\n\nmaterials. Caseworkers are forced to use their work phones (if provided) or their personal phones \nas “hot-spots” for children to access schoolwork. \n246.  DCS  purports  to  provide  on-site  education  to children  at  assessment  centers; \nhowever,  upon  information  and  belief,  DCS  does  not  provide  any  teachers,  instruction,  or \nopportunities for interaction or collaboration with educators. Instead, DCS distributes worksheets \nto  the  children  at  assessment  centers  without  any  support  or  guidance  to  complete  them. \nFrequently, the worksheets provided fall far below the grade level of the children receiving them, \ndepriving children of an appropriate education. \n247.  DCS applies their worksheet distribution system to all children at assessment \ncenters, regardless of their needs, diagnoses, or IEPs.  \nX.  Lack of Medical Care \n248.  Ensuring that children and youth in the custody of DCS receive adequate medical \nand dental care is critical to the children’s health and well-being. Regular preventive care, early \ndiagnosis, and treatment are essential to restoring and maintaining children’s health.  \n249.  Under the Medicaid Act, a state which accepts federal Medicaid funding must meet \nminimum  federal  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Social  Security  Act  and  its  implementing \nregulations. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). Tennessee has accepted federal funding and is so bound. Tenn. \nCode Ann. § 71-5-101 et seq. \n250.  The Medicaid Act requires Tennessee to provide medical assistance, including \nservices  known  as  “Early  and  Periodic  Screening,  Diagnostic,  and  Treatment  Services” \n(“EPSDT”)  for  children  who  are  eligible  for  Medicaid.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396a(a)(10)(A), \n1396d(a)(4)(B). Foster children are eligible for Medicaid, which Tennessee administers through \nthe state agency TennCare. \n61 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 61 of 82 PageID #: 230\n\n251.  States are required to provide screenings to identify children’s mental and physical \nhealth needs, as well as arrange for treatment services necessary to correct or ameliorate a child’s \nmental  or  physical  health  conditions.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396a(a)(10)(A);  1396a(a)(43)(C); \n1396d(a)(4)(B); 1396d(r)(1); 396d(r)(5).  \n252.  DCS’s Office of Child Health is responsible for ensuring that all children in its \ncustody receive appropriate health care. Each of the 12 DCS regions has a regional health team, \nincluding a regional nurse consultant, a health advocacy representative, and a service appeals \ntracking coordinator, which coordinates with TennCare and enters medical data into TFACTS. \nHowever, systemic failures within DCS, including an overreliance on outdated paper forms and \nmanual processes, have led to significant delays and mismanagement in providing necessary \nhealthcare services to children in foster care. \n253.  DCS  must  provide  the  required  initial  EPSDT  screenings  with  “reasonable \npromptness.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396(a)(8). DCS policy mandates that all children receive initial EPSDT \nmedical screenings within 30 days of entering custody. Additionally, all children 12 months or \nolder must receive a dental examination within 30 days of entering custody and every six months \nthereafter, pursuant to the schedule recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. \nDespite these requirements, DCS routinely fails to meet these deadlines, preventing early detection \nof medical and dental conditions and leaving children vulnerable to untreated health issues. \n254.   DCS’s reliance on manual, paper-based processes to complete, review, and follow \nup on children’s medical and dental screenings has created systemic errors and significant delays \nin  services.  The  inefficiencies  in  these  outdated  processes  introduce  opportunities  for \nmismanagement, missing documentation, and delays in critical follow-ups.  \n62 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 62 of 82 PageID #: 231\n\n255.  The quality of medical data recorded in TFACTS is unreliable, raising concerns \nabout the accuracy of children’s medical records. Due to inconsistencies in documentation, neither \nDCS management nor external auditors can confidently verify whether children receive the care \nthey need. The lack of a reliable medical tracking system increases the risk that children with \nurgent healthcare needs will go unnoticed. Delays in screening reviews prevent children from \nreceiving timely medical interventions, worsen undiagnosed health conditions, and deprive case \nmanagers of the ability to make informed decisions about children’s healthcare needs.  \n256.  The high turnover rate of case managers and excessive caseloads further contribute \nto delays in healthcare. Case managers are responsible for ensuring that children receive timely \nscreenings, follow-up care, and necessary treatments. However, when case managers frequently \nleave their positions, new caseworkers must take over unfamiliar cases, often with incomplete or \nmissing  medical  records.  This  results  in  children  missing  critical  health  appointments, \nexperiencing gaps in treatment, and remaining in limbo while waiting for necessary care. \n257.  Mental health services remain inadequate across Tennessee, with children in foster \ncare frequently unable to access trauma-informed therapy, psychiatric evaluations, and behavioral \nhealth interventions. DCS’s failure to provide timely medical and dental screenings, combined \nwith systemic inefficiencies, provider shortages, and case manager turnover, has had devastating \nconsequences for the children in its custody. Many children are left without necessary treatments, \nworsening  their  existing  health  conditions  and  increasing  the  risk  of  long-term  medical \ncomplications.  In  addition,  children  with  severe  mental  health  needs  remain  untreated, \nexacerbating their behavioral challenges and hindering their ability to achieve stable placements. \n258.  Tennessee’s high rate of foster instability combined with the network adequacy \nissues for behavioral health treatment results in frequent delays for children to begin receiving \n63 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 63 of 82 PageID #: 232\n\nservices and large gaps in receipt of services each time a child loses a placement and has to go \nback on the wait list for services in their new placement location. DCS regularly fails to search for \nnew providers in the child’s new location for extended periods of time after a change in placement. \nXI.  Failure to Establish a Reliable Information System \n259.  A reliable and functional information system is an essential component of an \neffective foster care system. To ensure the safety and well-being of children, caseworkers must \nhave access to accurate, complete, and easily accessible information that allows them to make \ninformed  decisions  about  placements,  case  management,  and  child  welfare  interventions. \nHowever, TFACTS, the central database used by DCS, has been plagued by systemic failures since \nits implementation in 2010. These ongoing technical deficiencies, system inefficiencies, and \nreporting inaccuracies have severely hindered DCS’s ability to manage cases effectively. \n260.  TFACTS was intended to serve as the primary case management tool for tracking \nplacements,  ensuring  compliance  with  medical  and  dental  screenings,  managing  financial \ntransactions,  and  facilitating  oversight  of  foster  care  cases.  However,  persistent  system \nmalfunctions have forced caseworkers to rely on cumbersome manual processes, spreadsheets, \nemails, and phone calls to obtain critical information, leading to delays in case management, \nmiscommunication, and failures in child welfare oversight. \n261.  Since its launch, TFACTS has been riddled with system functionality issues, \nincluding slow system processing, unexpected user logouts, and the inability to generate accurate \nprogram  reports.  In  2021,  DCS  implemented  a  financial  enhancement  feature  designed  to \nstreamline payments to foster parents and private providers. While this update improved financial \ntransactions, the update caused significant problems with other parts of the system, including \ndisruptions to case management data, limitations in system reporting capabilities, and delays in \n64 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 64 of 82 PageID #: 233\n\naccessing essential case information. As a result, DCS employees were left unable to run critical \nprogram reports or verify data accuracy, further undermining the Department’s ability to manage \nchild welfare cases effectively. \n262.   The inadequacy of TFACTS has forced case managers and regional administrators \nto  create  their  own  makeshift  tracking  systems.  Because  TFACTS  lacks  real-time  tracking \ncapabilities, case managers must manually search for placement availability using phone calls, \nemails, and spreadsheets, instead of relying on an automated system. This outdated approach leads \nto  delays  in  finding  appropriate  placements  for  children  in  foster  care  and  contributes  to \nunnecessary disruptions in children’s lives. \n263.  One of the most serious deficiencies of TFACTS is its inability to accurately record \nand track child placements. When children are placed in temporary settings such as state offices, \nhotels, or transitional placements, the system can only record the child’s location as a “regional \nstate office,” rather than identifying the specific placement. As a result, DCS management lacks \nvisibility into the actual whereabouts of children in custody, creating accountability gaps and \nmaking it impossible to track children in real time and to determine the additional services needed. \nEach DCS region has been forced to maintain independent Excel spreadsheets to track children in \ntemporary placements, leading to fragmented and unreliable data, and an inability to track where \nserious problems arise. \n264.  The number of temporary placements has increased, yet top DCS management \nremains unaware of the number and location of children in these placements due to the system’s \ntracking failures. Without an accurate, centralized placement tracking system, case managers \nstruggle to locate available beds, delaying placements and prolonging instability for children. \n65 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 65 of 82 PageID #: 234\n\n265.  The inefficiencies of TFACTS have directly contributed to delays in finding stable \nplacements, ensuring timely medical care, and preventing disruptions in services. Case managers \nalready struggle under heavy caseloads, staff shortages, and high turnover rates, and the additional \nadministrative burden caused by system failures further prevents them from effectively serving \nchildren in foster care.  \n266.  TFACTS also fails to automate and aggregate data needed to track systemic child \nabuse trends. The Special Investigations Unit (“SIU”) monthly report is intended to flag patterns \nof abuse by identifying individuals with ten or more instances of abuse. However, TFACTS cannot \naccurately generate this data, forcing staff to manually count investigations and input findings into \nspreadsheets. This process is highly susceptible to human error, with investigators miscounting \ncases or failing to identify repeat offenders due to duplicate profiles in TFACTS.  \n267.  DCS’s failure to maintain a functional and accurate information system is a primary \ncause of delayed services, missed visits, and harmful placements. \nXII.  Tennessee’s Troubled Child Welfare History \n268.  The 2022 Performance Audit Report by the Department of the Comptroller is the \nlatest in a long line of documents detailing DCS’s failures. Audits by the Department of the \nComptroller describe these failures repeatedly over the course of three decades, and DCS’s lack \nof action to remedy them.  \n269.  DCS met the required Brian A. settlement metrics by 2017, leading the court to \nterminate jurisdiction over all metrics on July 17, 2017. Unfortunately, DCS’s performance \ndeclined soon after. Today, DCS’s performance in many areas has sunk to pre-Brian A. levels. \n66 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 66 of 82 PageID #: 235\n\na.  In January 2017, DCS had a rate of 96% compliance with the required \naverage caseload limit of 20 cases per caseworker. By fiscal year 2019, \ncompliance dropped to 89%. By April 2022, compliance was down to 63%.  \nb.  In FY2017, DCS timely performed a CANS assessment in 99% of cases. \nBy FY2022, the rate of timely assessments had fallen by 17%. \nc.  In FY 2017, DCS moved children an average of 6.6 times per 1,000 days. \nBy FY 2023, this had ballooned to 10.1 moves per 1,000 days. \nd.  In a March 2017 report, 97%-100% of children with a goal of reunification \nhad at least one face-to-face visit with a parent of at least one hour. DCS \nabandoned this metric almost immediately; from July 2017 to June 2018, \nthis metric dropped to 56%. By early 2024, foster children’s visitation with \nparents and siblings in foster care was rated as adequate in only 46% of \ncases. \nXIII.  Actual Justiciable Controversy as to Which Plaintiffs Have a Stake in the Outcome  \n  \n270.  Based  upon  the  foregoing,  an  actual  controversy  exists  between  the  parties \nregarding the following issues of fact:  \na.  Defendants’ actions and inactions maintain a system that fails to provide \nPlaintiffs with safe, secure, and appropriate foster care placements; fails to \nprovide and implement permanency plans; fails to provide foster children \nwith necessary services; and fails to regularly evaluate foster children’s \nphysical and mental well-being.  \n67 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 67 of 82 PageID #: 236\n\nb.  Defendants’ actions and inactions constitute a policy, pattern, practice, or \ncustom of deliberate indifference to the substantial and unreasonable risk of \nphysical, psychological, and emotional harm to children in DCS custody.  \nc.  Defendants’ practices are so deficient collectively that they re-inflict injury \non the abused and/or neglected Plaintiffs and amount to the deprivation of \nPlaintiffs’ rights while in government custody, including the right to be free \nfrom the infliction of unnecessary pain, the right to conditions and duration \nof foster care reasonably related to the purpose of government custody, the \nright to a permanent home and family, the right to treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose and assumptions of government custody, and \nthe right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable and unnecessary \nintrusions  into  their  emotional  well-being.  Defendants’  deprivation  of \nPlaintiffs’ rights while in government custody has given rise to an actual, \nexisting controversy between the parties. \n271.  Plaintiffs have a real stake in the outcome of this case, as their physical and mental \nhealth has been harmed, and remains at substantial and unreasonable risk of being further harmed, \nas a result of Defendants’ actions and inactions.  \n272.  Defendants retain the practical power to adversely affect Plaintiffs, as they are \nultimately or directly responsible for, and have ultimate or direct control over, whether DCS \nprovides constitutionally adequate services to the Plaintiffs herein and the putative classes of foster \nchildren they seek to represent. \n \n68 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 68 of 82 PageID #: 237\n\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Substantive Due Process \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n273.  Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n274.   A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution to provide reasonable care to and protect from harm a child it has taken \ninto its foster care custody. \n275.   The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional judgment and \namounts to deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected liberty, property, and \nprivacy  interests.  As  a  result,  Plaintiffs  are  presently  suffering  an  ongoing  constitutional \ndeprivation of their substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution so long as they remain in state custody subject to statewide policies and \npractices that expose all foster children to a substantial risk of physical, psychological, mental, and \nemotional harm. \n276.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to:  \na.  the right to freedom from maltreatment while in foster care;  \nb.  the  right  to  protection  from  unnecessary  intrusions  into  the  child’s \nemotional and psychological well-being while in government custody; \nc.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable and unnecessary \nintrusions into the child’s emotional and psychological well-being while in \ngovernment custody; \n69 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 69 of 82 PageID #: 238\n\nd.  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the \npurpose of government custody;  \ne.  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and assumptions \nof government custody; \nf.  the  right  not to  be maintained  in  custody  longer  than  is  necessary  to \naccomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \ncustody; and \ng.  the right to receive a minimally adequate education. \n277.   Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and therefore are entitled to injunctive \nrelief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Right to Familial Association \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n278.  Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n279.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional judgment and \namounts to deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected liberty and privacy \ninterests. Defendants’ policies and practices amount to an ongoing intrusion into foster children’s \nfundamental  rights  to  a  permanent  home  and  familial  association  o  derived  from  the  First \nAmendment right of association, the Ninth Amendment reservation of rights to the people, and the \nFourteenth Amendment substantive due process protections. \n280.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and therefore are entitled to injunctive \nrelief. \n70 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 70 of 82 PageID #: 239\n\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq. \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n281.   Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n282.   The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, or custom of depriving Plaintiffs of their rights under the Adoption Assistance and Child \nWelfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, to: \na.  placement in a foster placement that conforms to nationally recommended \nprofessional standards, 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10);  \nb.  a written case plan that includes a plan to provide safe, appropriate and \nstable foster care placements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A);  \nc.  a written case plan that ensures that the child receives safe and proper care \nwhile  in  foster  care  and  implementation  of  that  plan,  42  U.S.C.  §§ \n671(a)(16), 675(1)(B);  \nd.  a written case plan that ensures provision of services to parents, children \nand foster parents to facilitate reunification, or where that is not possible, \nthe permanent placement of the child and implementation of that plan, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B);  \ne.  a written case plan, where appropriate, that ensures the location of an \nadoptive or other permanent home for the child and implementation of that \nplan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(E); \n71 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 71 of 82 PageID #: 240\n\nf.  a written case plan that ensures the educational stability of the child while \nin foster care and implementation of that plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), \n675(1)(G);  \ng.  a case review system in which each child has a case plan designed to achieve \nsafe  and  appropriate  foster  care  placements,  42  U.S.C.  §§  671(a)(16), \n675(5)(A);  \nh.  a case review system in which the status of the child is reviewed no less \nfrequently than every six months by a court, or person responsible for case \nmanagement, for purposes of determining the safety of the child, continuing \nnecessity and appropriateness of the placement, extent of compliance with \nthe  permanency  plan  and  projected  date  of  permanency, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(C); and  \ni.  receive  quality  services  to  protect  each  child’s  safety  and  health, \n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22). \n283.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and therefore are entitled to injunctive \nrelief. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act \n(Asserted by the ADA Subclass Against Defendants) \n \n284.  Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein. \n285.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \nits enabling regulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.101 et seq., prohibit discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities. \n72 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 72 of 82 PageID #: 241\n\n286.  ADA  Subclass  Plaintiffs  have  behavioral,  developmental  and  psychiatric \ndisabilities, which qualify them as individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA, \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132(2),  and  “otherwise  qualified  individuals  with  a  disability”  under  the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). They meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of foster care services provided by DCS. \n287.  Defendants are public entities, or public officials of a public entity, subject to the \nprovisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132(1)(A). Such entities also receive federal financial \nassistance and are thus subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b); \n34 C.F.R. 104.51.  \n288.  Title II of the ADA prohibits a public entity from excluding a person with a \ndisability from participating in, or denying the benefits of, the goods, services, programs and \nactivities of the entity or otherwise discriminating against a person on the basis of his or her \ndisability. \n289.  Likewise,  the  Rehabilitation  Act  and  its  enabling  regulations  prohibit \ndiscrimination in the provision of services by any entity receiving federal funding. 34 C.F.R. \n104.4(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2); 34 C.F.R. 104.52(a)(2). \n290.  Under the regulations enforcing the ADA, the state may not “[p]rovide a qualified \nindividual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of \nachievement as that provided to others . . . .” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii). \n291.  Accordingly, DCS must provide children with disabilities an equal opportunity to \naccess foster care services and educational services, in the least restrictive appropriate setting, as \nit provides children without disabilities in its custody. \n73 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 73 of 82 PageID #: 242\n\n292.  Moreover, Defendants have an affirmative duty to “make reasonable modifications \nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \nwould  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the  service,  program,  or  activity.” \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). \n293.  As set forth above, the regulatory hallmark and guiding force of disability law is \nthe provision of services, including the child’s placement in the most integrated environment \nappropriate to the youth’s needs. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(b)(2); see also \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999). \n294.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violations of Title II of the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiffs have been or are at risk of being placed in overly restrictive \nsettings, being deprived of education, and being subjected to unnecessary trauma because of their \ndisabilities, as set forth above, and will continue to suffer injury until Defendants are required to, \nand have, come into compliance with the requirements of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. \n(Against all Defendants) \n \n295.  Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n296.   The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, or custom of depriving Plaintiffs of their rights under the Medicaid Act, as amended by \nthe Social Security Amendments of 1967, to: \na.  Medical assistance, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10), 1396d(a);  \nb.  Medical assistance with reasonable promptness, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8); \n74 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 25     Filed 06/16/25     Page 74 of 82 PageID #: 243\n\nc.   Timely early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396d(r); \nd.  Early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services provided \nby or arranged for by Defendants, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(B); \ne.  Corrective treatment arranged by Defendants, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(C); \nand \nf.  Necessary healthcare, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures to \ncorrect  or  ameliorate  defects  and  physical  and  mental  illnesses  and \nconditions discovered by the screening services, 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5). \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Named Plaintiffs, on behalf of the putative Class and Subclass they \nrepresent, respectfully request that this Honorable Court exercise its legal and equitable powers \nand award Class-wide relief as follows: \nI.  Order that this action be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure; \nII.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting Plaintiffs to practices that violate their \nrights, including by: \na.

Haslam, this Court oversaw nearly \nevery aspect of Tennessee’s child welfare system from 2001 to 2019.  ECF 25 ¶¶ 4–6.  In the years \nsince Brian A., Defendants have continued to improve Tennessee’s child welfare system.  For \nexample, Tennessee has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in increasing compensation and \nsupport for Case Managers; expanding placements for foster children; expanding prevention \nservices to minimize the extent to which children are removed from their homes; and delivering \ncomprehensive health care services for foster children.  While Tennessee faces challenges that all \nchild welfare systems face nationwide, Defendants devote enormous resources to transparently \naddressing those challenges, in collaboration with their state, local, and federal partners. \nPlaintiffs now seek to re-impose federal court oversight over Defendants.  However, \nfederal courts are not “continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of [e]xecutive action.”  \nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752, 760 (1984), abrogated on other grounds by Lexmark Intern., \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118 (2014).  Rather, federal courts only have \njurisdiction to hear claims when the relief sought is “likely” to redress a concrete injury suffered \nby the plaintiffs.  See, e.g., R. K. ex rel. J. K. v. Lee, 53 F.4th 995, 1001 (6th Cir. 2022).  \nIn this case, this Court lacks jurisdiction—and Plaintiffs lack standing—because the relief \nPlaintiffs seek is not “likely” to redress the alleged injuries of any of the Named Plaintiffs.  While \nthat relief would require this Court to oversee nearly every aspect of the State’s child welfare \nsystem, it is purely speculative that it would redress any of the Named Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.  \nFurther, the systemic monitoring and oversight of child welfare decisions will interfere with \nongoing Tennessee juvenile court proceedings, and therefore principles of federalism and comity \npreclude this Court from ordering much of the relief that Plaintiffs seek.  Finally, Plaintiffs fail to \n1 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 12 of 57 PageID #: 462\n\n \nstate a claim for which relief can be granted: The Spending Clause statutes on which Plaintiffs rely \nare not privately enforceable because they do not “unambiguous[ly] use rights-creating language,” \nsee, e.g., Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, 606 U.S. ---, 145 S. Ct. 2219, 2235–36 \n(June 26, 2025), and Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to support any ongoing Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), Rehabilitation Act, or constitutional violations with respect to any Named \nPlaintiff.  In Brian A., this Court denied in part the motion to dismiss, which raised some of the \narguments  Defendants  raise  here.    However,  Brian  A.  was  a  different  case  with  different \nallegations, and the law relevant to child welfare litigation has evolved significantly since 2000, \nsee, e.g., Medina, 145 S. Ct. 2219; Sprint Commc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69 (2013); Siefert v. \nHamilton Cnty., 951 F.3d 753 (6th Cir. 2020). \nAdministering any child welfare program is challenging, complex, and dynamic, requiring \nDefendants to work closely with the legislature, other executive agencies, state courts, the federal \ngovernment, and a host of other partners, all of which are already working together to achieve \nmany of the results that Plaintiffs now ask this Court to order, oversee, and monitor.  The Court \ndoes not have jurisdiction to do so, nor do Plaintiffs make a legally cognizable claim for the relief \nthey seek.  The First Amended Complaint should be dismissed. \nBACKGROUND \nThe Department of Children’s Services (DCS) administers the child welfare system in \nTennessee.  DCS investigates allegations of abuse and neglect and provides services to thousands \nof children and their families, including: children in foster care because of dependency and neglect; \nchildren in DCS custody through a “delinquency” or “unruly” proceeding; non-custodial children \nat risk of further child welfare system involvement; and children placed on state probation and \n2 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 13 of 57 PageID #: 463\n\n \nsupervision by the juvenile courts.1  DCS employs Case Managers to provide case work to these \nchildren and families.  See SFY 2024 Annual Report, at 4–7, 9, 17.   \nThe allegations and claims in this case relate to the subset of children served by DCS who \nhave been removed from their homes and placed into DCS custody.  This includes both children \nin DCS custody because of dependency and neglect proceedings and children in DCS custody \nthrough juvenile justice proceedings.  Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 37-1-113, 37-1-114, 37-1-130 to -132.  \nAll children in DCS custody have an open juvenile court case with regular permanency hearings, \nand all matters relating to that child’s dependency and neglect or juvenile justice proceeding are \nunder the “exclusive original jurisdiction” of juvenile courts.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-103.2     \nAll eligible children in DCS custody are enrolled in Medicaid through a statewide health \nplan serving specialized populations.3  This health plan has developed a “Best Practice Network” \nof providers to serve children in DCS custody, composed of primary care practitioners, dentists, \n \n1 See DCS, Department of Children’s Services Annual Report State Fiscal Year 2024, at 4–7, 9 \n(n.d.) http://bit.ly/45DLZjG [hereinafter, “SFY 2024 Annual Report”].  On a motion to dismiss, \nthe Court can consider documents “appropriate for the taking of judicial notice.”  Wyser-Pratte \nMgmt. Co., Inc. v. Telxon Corp., 413 F.3d 553, 560 (6th Cir. 2005).  The documents cited by \nDefendants are publicly available and their content “can be accurately and readily determined from \nsources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,” and thus “not subject to reasonable \ndispute.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); cf., e.g., Weiser v. Benson, 48 F.4th 617, 620 n.3 (6th Cir. 2022) \n(taking judicial notice of a publicly available document from a state agency).  \n2 Once an adoption petition is filed in chancery or circuit court, the juvenile court shares \njurisdiction with the adoption court.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 37-1-103(c), 36-1-116(f).  \n3 For the small number of children in DCS custody who are not eligible for Medicaid, DCS covers \nthe same services available through Medicaid.   Cf. DCS,  Protocol for Health Services for \nChildren/Youth in DCS Custody, at 7 (eff. Feb. 2025), http://bit.ly/41utCLx [hereinafter, “Protocol \nfor Health Servs.”]; DCS, Health Services Authorization for Non-TennCare Eligible, Form CS-\n0533 (rev. Jan. 2019), http://bit.ly/4oUwDyZ.    \n3 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 14 of 57 PageID #: 464\n\n \nand behavioral health providers.4  These primary care practitioners also serve as “medical homes” \nby coordinating physical and behavioral care for the child.  DCS Health Care Plan, at 2.   \nDCS is subject to oversight by the Tennessee General Assembly.  For example, the Joint \nGovernment Operations Committee reviews DCS to “determine the quality, efficiency, and \nsuccess” of DCS.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-29-105; see also § 4-29-109.  As part of this review, the \nCommittee holds public hearings and receives testimony about DCS, and the Comptroller of the \nTreasury undertakes periodic program review audits.  §§ 4-29-104(a), 4-29-111(b). \nDCS also works closely with, and is subject to oversight from, the federal Administration \nfor Children and Families (ACF).  For example, ACF reviews and approves DCS’s Child and \nFamily Service Plans (CFSPs).  See 42 U.S.C. § 629b; 45 C.F.R. § 1357.10.  As part of the CFSP \nprocess, DCS must submit to ACF interim Annual Progress  and Services  Reports  (APSR) \nassessing  progress  and  describing  forthcoming  activities  and  services  to  further  advance \nimplementation of the CFSP.  45 C.F.R. § 1357.16.  DCS also reports reams of data to ACF each \nyear, including Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) data and \nNational Child Abuse and Neglect System (NCANDS) data.  42 U.S.C. § 5101 et seq.; 45 C.F.R. \n§§ 1355.20, 1355.41, 1355.42, 1355.43, 1355.44.   \nIn Brian A. v. Haslam,5 this Court oversaw nearly every aspect of the child welfare system \nfrom 2001 to 2019.  No. 3:00-cv-0045 (M.D. Tenn.).  Plaintiffs allege that, during this period, “the \nState made substantial  changes to its  child welfare system, which  resulted in a significant \nimprovement in the lives of children in the State’s custody.”  ECF 25 ¶¶ 5–6.   \n \n4  DCS,  Coordination  of  Health  Care  Oversight  and  Coordination  Plan,  at  2  (2024), \nhttp://bit.ly/41WA26k [hereinafter “DCS Health Care Plan”].   \n5 Brian A. v.

For example, DCS increased the \naverage starting salary for entry-level Case Managers from $43,992 to $50,600;6 capped first-year \ncaseloads at 10 cases per Case Manager, CAP Quarterly Report, at 6; from 2021 to 2024, decreased \nCase Manager turnover from 29 percent to 17 percent and decreased the Case Manager vacancy \nrate from 24 percent to 8 percent, see SFY 2024 Annual Report, at 1; and implemented an ongoing \nutilization review process to reduce lengths of stay in residential treatment.7  In addition, in 2023, \nthe legislature appropriated over $60 million for rate increases for foster family homes and \nresidential treatment providers and $107 million to expand placement capacity for children \nentering DCS custody, including by constructing intake and assessment centers.8   \nAs a result of these and other efforts, the overwhelming majority of children in DCS \ncustody are well-served by the system.  While any maltreatment is unacceptable to Defendants, \nmaltreatment-in-care in Tennessee is exceedingly rare: the most recent data released by ACF \nshows Tennessee’s rate was 8.72 incidents per 100,000 days in DCS custody.9  As of September \n \n6 DCS, Corrective Action Plan on Audit Recommendations Quarterly Report, at 6 (June 13, 2023) \nhttp://bit.ly/4g2DKkT [hereinafter, “CAP Quarterly Report”].   \n7 See DCS, Tennessee Placement System Orientation & Training Guide, at 7, 15–16, 22–23 (Dec. \n2023), http://bit.ly/46eCMys.     \n8 CAP Quarterly Report, at 9–10; DCS, Department of Children’s Services Annual Report State \nFiscal Year 2023, at 10 (n.d.) http://bit.ly/4oYxSgr [hereinafter, “SFY 2023 Annual Report”].   \n9  ACF,  CFSR  Round  4  Statewide  Data  Indicators  Workbook,  at  8–9  (Oct.  2024) \nhttps://perma.cc/FKK9-2TJC (attached as Ex. 1). \n5 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 16 of 57 PageID #: 466\n\n \n30, 2023, 80 percent of children in DCS custody—inclusive of children in custody through juvenile \njustice proceedings—were placed in family homes or are on a trial home visit.10 \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff must allege facts to \nestablish subject matter jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Moir v. Greater Cleveland Reg’l Transit Auth., 895 \nF.2d 266, 269 (6th Cir. 1990).  In addition, when defendants contest jurisdiction as a factual matter, \n“the court must weigh the evidence . . . , without presuming the challenged allegations in the \ncomplaint to be true.”  Doe v. Lee, 752 F. Supp. 3d 884, 896 (M.D. Tenn. 2024).  See Ohio Nat. \nLife Ins. Co. v. United States, 922 F.2d 320, 325 (6th Cir. 1990); Robinson v. Purkey, 326 F.R.D. \n105, 127–28 (M.D. Tenn. 2018).  To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the plaintiff \nmust plead facts to “state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  In \nconsidering such a motion, the court “must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations . . . as true.”  \nSee Hensley Mfg. v. ProPride, Inc., 579 F.3d 603, 609 (6th Cir. 2009).   \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Court Should Dismiss the Claims Under Rule 12(b)(1). \nPlaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed because the Named Plaintiffs lack standing and \nbecause  principles of  comity and federalism require this Court to  abstain from exercising \njurisdiction.  \nA.  The Named Plaintiffs Lack Standing.  \nTo establish standing, the plaintiffs must allege facts to establish that they have suffered an \ninjury-in-fact that is “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant” and “likely” to be \n \n10 ACF, The AFCARS Dashboard, All Children in Care Living Arrangement: Tennessee, 2023 \n(last visited, August 29, 2025) http://bit.ly/4lPrTYo (attached as Ex. 2).   \n6 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 17 of 57 PageID #: 467\n\n \nredressed by the relief sought.  See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (cleaned \nup).  In putative class actions, the named plaintiffs must have standing.  See, e.g., Simon v. E. Ky. \nWelfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. 26, 40 n.20 (1976) (cleaned up).   \n1.  Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Facts to Establish Redressability.  \nThe redressability inquiry focuses on whether the relief requested is “likely” to redress the \nalleged injury, which requires the court to “consider the relationship between ‘the judicial relief \nrequested’ and the ‘injury’ suffered.”  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 73 (2024) (quoting \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 (2021)).  Where, as here, the plaintiffs seek prospective, \ninjunctive relief, they must establish that the relief is “likely” to redress an ongoing injury or a \n“substantial” risk of “imminent” future injuries.  Mikel v. Quin, 58 F.4th 252, 258–59 (6th Cir. \n2023), cert. denied sub nom. Mikel v. Nichols, 143 S. Ct. 2660 (2023).  In addition, the plaintiffs \nmust establish redressability “for . . . each form of relief that they seek.”  TransUnion LLC v. \nRamirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021). \nIn this case, Plaintiffs do not allege facts to establish that the relief they seek is “likely” to \nredress any of the alleged injuries of any of the Named Plaintiffs.  As they must in a Rule 23(b)(2) \nputative class action, Plaintiffs do not seek relief specific to any of the Named Plaintiffs, but instead \nseek class-wide relief.  ECF 25, at 75–80.  However, in this case, it is purely speculative that this \nclass-wide relief will redress any of the Named Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.11   \nFor example, Plaintiffs allege that several of the Named Plaintiffs are experiencing, or are \nat risk of experiencing, inappropriate or unsafe placements.  See, e.g., ECF 25 ¶¶ 41, 47, 69, 87, \n \n11 For the Court’s convenience, Appendix A lists the relief sought by Plaintiffs in the First \nAmended Complaint, with short explanations (and cross-references to Defendants’ arguments in \nthis Memorandum) about whether each part of the relief would redress the alleged injuries of any \nNamed Plaintiff and whether this Court has the authority to order the relief.   \n7 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 18 of 57 PageID #: 468\n\n \n117, 125.  Plaintiffs do not ask this Court to order different placements for any of those Named \nPlaintiffs, but instead ask the Court to order Defendants to implement a set of broad and vague \nprogram improvements, such as “recruiting, training, [and] supporting an array of appropriate \nfoster placements”; “restricting Defendants from placing any child in a congregate care setting \nbased  on  the  unavailability  of  foster  home  resources”;  “recruit[ing]  and  retain[ing]  enough \nqualified  and  appropriately  trained  workers  providing  direct  supervision  and  planning  for \nchildren”; and “conducting a workload analysis . . . to determine manageable caseloads, and \nimplementing the recommendations of that analysis.”  ECF 25, at 75–79.   \nPutting aside that DCS already expends enormous resources on recruiting, training, and \nsupporting foster families and Case Managers,12 Plaintiffs do not allege any facts that establish \nthat additional training or support of foster families is “likely” to result in a different placement \nfor any Named Plaintiff.  Similarly, Plaintiffs do not allege any facts to establish that recruiting \nand  retaining  more  “qualified  and  appropriately  trained”  Case  Managers,  or  implementing \nrecommendations from a “workload analysis,” will result in a more appropriate placement for any \nNamed Plaintiff.  Nor do Plaintiffs allege facts to establish that prohibiting placement “in a \ncongregate care setting based on the unavailability of foster home resources” will cause any Named \nPlaintiff to be placed in a family home.  The availability of an appropriate foster family depends \non the willingness of private individuals to become foster parents and accept the Named Plaintiffs \nin their home.  Unfortunately, as Plaintiffs acknowledge, many foster homes “are unwilling to \naccept high-needs children,” ECF 25 ¶ 194.  If this Court enjoins Defendants “from placing any \n \n12 See DCS Policy 16.4 (rev. Apr. 11, 2024), http://bit.ly/4lN2uyN (attached as Ex. 3); DCS Policy \n16.9 (rev.

However,  DCS  already  “thoroughly \ninvestigates” complaints of maltreatment, and Plaintiffs do not allege that any Named Plaintiffs \n(other than Thomas H.) are currently subject to maltreatment or face a substantial risk of imminent \nmaltreatment, and therefore implementing policy changes to minimize maltreatment in care cannot \nplausibly redress any ongoing injury of any Named Plaintiff (other than Thomas H.).  Moreover, \nwhile Defendants agree it is critically important to “thoroughly investigat[e]” complaints of \nmaltreatment, ordering this class-wide relief is not “likely” to redress any alleged injury of any \nparticular Named Plaintiff.  Similarly, Plaintiffs have not alleged that any of the Named Plaintiffs \nare being “shackled” or face an imminent risk of such “shackling,” presumably because DCS \npolicy  authorizes  “mechanical  restraints”  only  in  limited  circumstances.13    Accordingly, \nprohibiting “shackling” would not redress any alleged ongoing injury of any Named Plaintiff.   \nAs the foregoing shows, redressing Named Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries depends on the \nactions of private third parties, such as private families who choose whether to foster a Named \nPlaintiff.    However,  redressability  is  much  harder—and  often  impossible—to  establish  if \nremedying the alleged injury depends on the action of third parties who are not defendants in the \ncase.  See, e.g., Murthy, 603 U.S. at 74; Binno v. Am. Bar Ass’n, 826 F.3d 338, 345 (6th Cir. 2016). \n \n13 See DCS Policy 31.19 (rev. Sept. 8, 2023), http://bit.ly/4n9Z8Hd (attached as Ex. 7). \n9 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 20 of 57 PageID #: 470\n\n \nFor example, in Johnson v. Becerra, the plaintiffs alleged that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services’ (HHS) administration of Medicare resulted in an insufficient supply of private \nhome health providers, which allegedly deprived the plaintiffs of home health services.  111 F.4th \n1237, 1241–42 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  As relief, the plaintiffs requested an injunction requiring (1) “the \nSecretary to make systemic reforms to his administration of the home health benefit,” such as \n“chang[ing] his ‘payment methods and criteria’ and reform[ing] ‘quality measurement and/or \nrating criteria’” to “‘[e]nsure that’” the plaintiffs have “reasonable access” to home health services, \nand (2) “the Secretary to focus more auditing and enforcement resources on” home health \nproviders.  Id. at 1245–46.  The D.C. Circuit held that plaintiffs lacked standing because they did \nnot allege facts sufficient to establish that this relief was “likely” to redress their alleged injuries.  \nId.  Even though increasing payments to providers presumably would expand access to services \nfor some people, the court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the relief was “likely” to result in \nplaintiffs securing Medicare-covered home health services, in part because such providers “are \nfree to choose whether to accept a patient,” id.  In addition, the plaintiffs “offer[ed] no reason . . . \nto infer that greater enforcement . . . would cause [private home health agencies] already serving \nMedicare beneficiaries to expand their services or would result in other [home health agencies] \nundertaking to serve Medicare beneficiaries.”  Id.   \nJohnson also held that the relief relating to payments to home health providers was \n“woefully underspecified” in that the plaintiffs “never identif[ied] what reforms are necessary to \nfix the problem.”  Id. at 1246.  The broad requested relief amounted to “an injunction instructing \nthe Secretary to better administer the law” and was not sufficiently “connect[ed] to their injuries.”  \nId. at 1246–47.  Even if  different HHS oversight could, “in theory,” “influence [provider] \n10 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 21 of 57 PageID #: 471\n\n \nbehavior,” “a quest for ill-defined ‘better odds’ is not” sufficient to prove redressability.  Id. at \n1247. \nAs in Johnson, Plaintiffs in this case allege that several of the Named Plaintiffs are not \nreceiving adequate health care from private health care providers paid by Medicaid, and they seek \nbroad, vague relief that they speculate will generally improve the program.  See, e.g., ECF 25, ¶¶ \n35, 54, 77, 79, 101, 128, 157.  For example, Plaintiffs seek an order to require Defendants to \nprovide foster children “with an adequate and individualized written case plan within 60 days of \nentering care”; “ensure” all foster children “timely receive” the “services and/or treatments” \nspecified in their case plan; “conduct[] a comprehensive evaluation” of foster children within 30 \ndays of entering care; and “ensure an adequate array of community-based therapeutic services are \navailable to children with disabilities.”  ECF 25, at 75–76.   \nHowever, Plaintiffs do not allege any facts establishing that this relief will “likely” cause \nany Named Plaintiff to receive any additional health care beyond what they are currently receiving.  \nTo begin with, existing state law or policy already requires much of the relief Plaintiffs seek.  For \nexample, DCS must create the case plan within 30 days of the child entering care, Tenn. Code \nAnn. § 37-2-403; the juvenile court must approve the case plan within 60 days of the child entering \ncare, id.; and Tennessee already pays for all medically necessary, Medicaid-covered services \ndelivered to foster children, see DCS Policy 20.7; Protocol for Health Servs., at 7.  Further, as in \nJohnson,  redressing  the  alleged  injuries  requires  action  from  independent  third  parties.    In \nTennessee, as in all states, private health care providers deliver medically necessary physical and \nbehavioral health services to foster children, see DCS Policy 20.7, at 1; Protocol for Health Servs., \nat 7, and Plaintiffs allege that providers in Tennessee lack the capacity to serve all foster children, \nECF 25 ¶ 257.  Ordering Defendants to ensure that all children receive services specified in their \n11 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 22 of 57 PageID #: 472\n\n \ncase plan, or to ensure an “adequate array of community-based therapeutic services,” will not \nmagically produce private providers willing to serve the Named Plaintiffs, ECF 25 at 76.  As in \nJohnson, those private providers “are free to choose whether to accept a patient,” 111 F.4th at \n1245–46, and Defendants cannot force a private provider to serve a particular Named Plaintiff, see \nAli  v.  Adamson,  No.  1:21-cv-71,  2023  WL  9382485,  at  *6  (W.D.  Mich.  Dec.  12,  2023) \n(unpublished) (explaining that a plaintiff “must bring an action against an individual who has the \npower to provide the relief sought” (cleaned up)).  Similarly, Plaintiffs do not allege any facts to \nestablish that completing more frequent “adequate and individualized written case plan[s]” or \n“comprehensive evaluations” of needs are “likely” to result in any Named Plaintiff receiving any \nhealth care services that the child is not already receiving.  \nFurther, even if Plaintiffs had alleged facts to establish that the relief would remedy Named \nPlaintiffs’ alleged injuries (which they have not), Plaintiffs’ claims would not be redressable \nbecause the relief would violate principles of federalism and separation of powers.  See Johnson, \n111 F.4th at 1244–47; Jonathan R. v. Morrisey, 768 F. Supp. 3d 756 (S.D.W. Va. 2025).  Article \nIII standing “is built on a single basic idea—the idea of separation of powers,” and federal courts \nare not “continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of [e]xecutive action.”  Allen, 468 U.S. \nat 752, 760 (cleaned up). \nHere, Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring Defendants to, among many other things: \n“establish and enforce mandatory performance metrics”; “recruit and retain enough qualified and \nappropriately trained workers providing direct supervision and planning for children in accordance \nwith reasonable professional standards”; “implement[] the recommendations of” a “workload \nanalysis”; hire a third party “to determine additional resource needs for services” and “implement \nthe recommendations of that assessment”; and “ensur[e] that children receive timely permanence, \n12 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 23 of 57 PageID #: 473\n\n \nplacement stability and a rate of maltreatment in care that is within national standards.”  ECF 25, \nat 75–79.  Ordering this relief would transform this Court into a “monitor[] of the wisdom and \nsoundness of” child welfare policy and practice, in contravention of Article III standing and \nseparation of powers principles.   \nPlaintiffs “do not seek to enjoin a particular unlawful action” by Defendants, but instead \n“request a court order instructing [Defendants] to make systemic reforms to [their] administration \nof” the child welfare system.  See Johnson, 111 F.4th at 1246.  That relief would wrest control of \nthe child welfare system from Tennessee’s democratically accountable leaders and put it in the \nhands of this Court.  But this Court cannot “hire state employees,” “oversee child welfare \nadministration,” or “move state funds and shift local priorities to enact statewide reform,” and \nArticle III judges do not have an “amorphous power to supervise the operations of government \nand reimagine [them] from the ground up.”  See Jonathan R., 768 F. Supp. 3d at 761–63 (alteration \nin original) (quoting Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 40 (2021)).  Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief risks this Court, “‘in the name of the Constitution, becoming enmeshed in the \nminutiae  of  state  operations’  and  depriving  local  officials  of  their  own  .  .  .  executive \nresponsibilities.”  See Shakman v. Pritzker, 43 F.4th 723, 731 (7th Cir. 2022) (quoting Lewis v. \nCasey,  518  U.S.  343,  361  (1996)).    For  example,  Plaintiffs  ask  this  Court  to  oversee  the \n“determin[ation]” and “implement[ation]” of appropriate caseload and resource levels and to \n“ensure” that placements, services, and case plans are “timely,” “appropriate,” “in the most \nintegrated setting,” and in accordance with “reasonable professional standards.”  See ECF 25, at \n75–79.  But a federal court may not “craft . . . policy that defines ‘adequate,’ ‘appropriate,’ \n‘sufficient,’ ‘unnecessary,’ and ‘unreasonable’ as the Plaintiffs ask.”  See Jonathan R., 768 F. \nSupp. 3d at 763.  Courts “possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy \n13 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 24 of 57 PageID #: 474\n\n \njudgments,” as their constitutional role is to “interpret the law.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012). \nThis Court also lacks the authority to grant much of the relief sought because it is outside \nthe control of Defendants.  In Sheppheard v. Morrisey, the plaintiffs alleged “overcrowding, \nunderstaffing, and deferred maintenance” of detention facilities and sought an injunction requiring \nthe defendants to, among other things, improve facility infrastructure and obtain funds to improve \nthe facilities and increase staffing levels.  143 F.4th 232, 239–40 (4th Cir. 2025).  The Fourth \nCircuit held that the plaintiffs’ injuries were “not redressable” because the plaintiffs “ha[d] not \nclearly alleged facts to show” that the defendants had the power to allocate funds or otherwise \nimplement the relief sought, and a federal court is “largely powerless” to order relief that is beyond \nthe control of the defendants.  Id. at 244–46, 248 (cleaned up).   \nIn this case, Plaintiffs ask this Court to, for example: “ensure an adequate array of \ncommunity-based therapeutic services are available”; ensure that there are “enough qualified and \nappropriately trained workers providing direct supervision and planning for children”; “enforce \ncaseload standards”; and ensure “an array of appropriate foster placements that meet the particular \nbehavioral, cultural,  and mental health needs of children.”   ECF 25,  at 78–79.   However, \ncompliance with this relief would depend upon the actions of third parties, e.g., foster families and \nprospective foster families deciding to accept children, private individuals deciding to work as \nCase Managers, and private providers deciding to provide health care services needed by foster \nchildren.  As the court held in Sheppheard, a court cannot issue an injunction that requires the \ndefendants to take action beyond their control.  143 F.4th at 244–48; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2); \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 73 (holding that plaintiffs could not satisfy redressability because third parties \n14 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 25 of 57 PageID #: 475\n\n \n“remain free to enforce” the policies allegedly causing the harm, even though those policies may \nhave been initially “tainted” by defendants’ actions). \n2.  Plaintiffs Have Failed to Allege that Dewayne W. is Experiencing an \nOngoing Injury or Imminent Risk of Injury.  \nAs explained above, in a case seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, “a plaintiff must \nshow actual present harm,” Memphis A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Hargett, 978 F.3d 378, 386 (6th \nCir. 2020) (citation and quotation omitted), or a substantial risk of “‘imminent,’” “‘certainly \nimpending’” future harm.  Tenn. Conf. of NAACP v. Lee, 139 F.4th 557, 562 (6th Cir. 2025) \n(quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Intern. USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)). \n  In this case, the First Amended Complaint fails to allege facts showing that Dewayne W. \nfaces ongoing harm or an “imminent,” “certainly impending” risk of future harm.  Plaintiffs allege \nthat DCS harmed Dewayne by placing him in “inappropriate” and “unsafe” placements in the past, \nand by “depriving him of his right to an appropriate education.”  ECF 25 ¶ 119.  However, \nDewayne is on a trial home visit with his biological mother, see id. ¶ 127, and the First Amended \nComplaint does not allege facts showing that Dewayne continues to experience any injury or faces \nimminent risk of future injury.  “Past may be precedent.  But the Supreme Court has not been \nsympathetic to claims that past occurrences of unlawful conduct create standing to obtain an \ninjunction against the risk of future unlawful conduct.”  Shelby Advocs. for Valid Elections v. \nHargett, 947 F.3d 977, 981 (6th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, Dewayne lacks \nstanding.  \nB.  Five of the Named Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Moot.   \nAt the time the First Amended Complaint in this case was filed on June 16, 2025, Named \nPlaintiffs Aaron C., Arielle C., Ava C., Andrew H., and Adrian H. (hereinafter, “C/H Siblings”) \nwere living with foster parents who were in the process of adopting them.  See Tenn.

The First Amended Complaint did not mention this material fact.  See ECF 25 ¶¶ 93–\n106.  In July 2025, the C/H Siblings’ adoption was finalized and they were released from DCS \ncustody.  See Ex. 8 (unredacted version filed under seal).   \nA plaintiff’s claim is moot “when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 \n(1969).  As the Supreme Court has explained, because the Constitution permits courts to “decide \nlegal questions only in the context of actual ‘Cases’ or ‘Controversies,’ . . . [a]n actual controversy \nmust be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.”  Alvarez v. \nSmith, 558 U.S. 87, 92 (2009) (cleaned up).  Several courts have found that adoption or release \nfrom state custody moots the claims of a child who is a named plaintiff in a suit against a state \nchild welfare agency.14  \nIn this case, because the C/H Siblings are no longer in DCS custody, Tenn. Code Ann. § \n36-1-121(a), none of the injunctive relief that Plaintiffs seek would impact them and they “lack a \nlegally cognizable interest in the outcome” of this case, see Powell, 395 U.S. at 496.  Accordingly, \ntheir claims are moot.   \n \n14 See, e.g., Sam M. v. Chafee, 800 F. Supp. 2d 363, 372–73 (D.R.I. 2001); 31 Foster Child. v. \nBush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1263 (11th Cir. 2003); Zola H. v.

Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971) and its progeny, principles of comity and \nfederalism require federal courts to abstain from exercising jurisdiction when there are underlying \nstate court proceedings that: (1) are one of the types of proceedings to which Younger applies; and \n(2) are “pending,” “involve an important state interest,” and “provide the federal plaintiff with an \nadequate opportunity to raise his constitutional claims.”  Doe v. Univ. of Ky., 860 F.3d 365, 369 \n(6th Cir. 2017).  In this case, both steps of the Younger inquiry are satisfied for nearly all of \nPlaintiffs’ claims, and therefore this Court should abstain from hearing those claims. \nAs to the first step of the inquiry, “Younger permits abstention” where the underlying state \ncourt proceedings are: criminal proceedings, “certain civil enforcement proceedings,” or civil \nproceedings involving orders “uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’ ability to perform their \njudicial functions.”  Id. (cleaned up); Sprint Commc’ns, Inc., 571 U.S. at 72.  “Civil enforcement \nproceedings” are proceedings initiated by a government entity that generally involve a “complaint, \nan investigation, notice of the charge, and the opportunity to introduce witnesses and evidence.”  \nDoe, 860 F.3d at 370.  As an example of a civil enforcement proceeding to which Younger applies, \nthe Supreme Court in Sprint cited its previous holding in Moore v. Sims.  See Sprint Commc’ns, \nInc., 571 U.S. at 579.  In Moore, three children and two parents, who were parties to a state court \nabuse-and-neglect  proceeding,  brought  a  constitutional  to  a  state  statute  governing  those \nproceedings.  442 U.S. 415, 418 (1979).  The Supreme Court held that the district court should \nhave abstained because the state was a party to the underlying state court proceeding, and that \nproceeding involved the removal of a child “in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes” \nrelating to child abuse.  Id. at 423 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n17 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 28 of 57 PageID #: 478\n\n \nIn this case, Tennessee’s juvenile court proceedings are “civil enforcement proceedings.”  \nLike the proceeding in Moore, Tennessee’s dependency and neglect proceedings and juvenile \njustice proceedings are generally initiated by the government, which generally remains a party, \nand are “in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes” relating to either child abuse or juvenile \ncrime.  See, e.g., Ashley W. v. Holcomb, 34 F.4th 588, 591 (7th Cir. 2022) (holding that Moore \nconcluded that “state-initiated child-welfare litigation” is a state civil proceeding to which Younger \napplies); Oglala Sioux Tribe v. Fleming, 904 F.3d 603, 610 (8th Cir. 2018) (relying on Moore and \nholding that state abuse and neglect proceedings are “civil enforcement” proceedings).  Plaintiffs’ \nclaims would interfere with these ongoing juvenile court proceedings because juvenile courts \noversee and issue orders relating to nearly all aspects of a child’s experience in care, including \ncase planning and the provision of physical and behavioral health services, see Tenn. Code Ann. \n§§ 37-2-403 to -409.  See Oglala Sioux Tribe, 904 F.3d at 610–11; 31 Foster Child. v. Bush, 329 \nF.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir. 2003); Joseph A. ex rel. Wolfe v. Ingram, 275 F.3d 1253, 1272 (10th \nCir. 2002); Ashley W., 34 F.4th at 591.   \nOne  circuit  has  held  that  child  welfare  proceedings  are  not  “civil  enforcement” \nproceedings, see Jonathan R. by Dixon v. Justice, 41 F.4th 316, 329 (4th Cir. 2022), but that case \nwas wrongly decided.  Jonathan R. misinterpreted Moore as applying only to initial removal \nproceedings, not ongoing hearings in the same case, and distinguished cases brought by plaintiff \nchildren from the case brought by “the abusive parents in Moore.”  See id. at 329–30.  However, \nnothing  in  Moore  suggests  a  distinction  between  different  stages  of  the  same  state  court \nproceeding, and the claims in Moore were brought by both the parents and the allegedly abused \n--\nchildren, see Moore, 442 U.S. at 418. \n18 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 29 of 57 PageID #: 479\n\n \nAs explained above, the second step in the Younger inquiry asks whether the state \nproceedings are “pending,” “involve an important state interest,” and “will provide the federal \nplaintiff with an adequate opportunity to raise his constitutional claims.”  Doe, 860 F.3d at 369 \n(citing Middlesex Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423, 432–34 (1982)).   \nIn this case, juvenile court proceedings are pending for all the Named Plaintiffs that remain \nin DCS custody,15 and those proceedings “implicate important state interests.”16  In addition, \nTennessee juvenile courts provide Named Plaintiffs with an “adequate opportunity” to raise nearly \nall the federal issues they bring in this case.  In both dependency and neglect and juvenile justice \nproceedings, Tennessee courts oversee and issue orders approving (or modifying or rejecting) the \nappropriateness of permanency plans, which set forth the services that each child will receive and \nthe long-term planning for each child.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-2-403; Tenn. R. Juv. P. 401; see \nalso Advisory Commission Comments to Tenn. R. Juv. P. 401.  While juvenile courts do not have \nthe authority to order specific placements, Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-129(c); In re Neveah W., 470 \nS.W.3d 807, 808 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015), they remain integrally involved in overseeing DCS \nplacement decisions as part of their authority to make reasonable effort determinations and to \noversee permanency plans, which includes making findings regarding the appropriateness of the \nchild’s placement.  See Tenn. R. Juv. P. 401, 402. \n \n15 See Advisory Commission Comments to Tenn. R. Juv. P. 401; Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-2-409; \nsee, e.g., ECF 25 ¶¶ 60, 83, 91, 121, 122, 142, 160. \n16 See, e.g., Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 766 (1982) (“[T]he State has an urgent interest in \nthe welfare of the child . . . the State’s goal is to provide the child with a permanent home.” (cleaned \nup)); Pethtel v. Tenn. Dep’t of Child. Servs., No. 3:10-cv-469, 2011 WL 5592853, at *5 (E.D. \nTenn. Nov. 16, 2011) (unpublished) (“State juvenile court proceedings concerning custody and \ndependency issues implicate important state interests relating to matters of domestic relations and \nthe welfare of children in state custody.”). \n19 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 30 of 57 PageID #: 480\n\n \n“Where vital state interests are involved, a federal court should abstain unless state law \nclearly bars the interposition of the” federal claims, Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 432 (cleaned up) , and \n“federal courts must presume that ‘the state courts are able to protect the interests of the federal \nplaintiff,’” Pethtel, 2011 WL 5592853, at *5 (quoting Kelm v. Hyatt, 44 F.3d 415, 419 (6th Cir. \n1995)).    In  Tennessee,  the  juvenile  courts  are  competent  to  hear  questions  of  federal  and \nconstitutional law, and each child is represented by a court-appointed attorney or a guardian ad \nlitem, or both, depending on the type of case.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 37-1-101(a)(4), 37-1-\n126(a)(1), 37-1-149; Tenn. R. Juv. P. 302(d)(1).  In addition, the First Amended Complaint does \nnot allege that any of the Named Plaintiffs ever raised any of the alleged violations of federal law \nin their juvenile court proceedings, and when a litigant has not attempted to raise alleged federal \nviolations in state court, “a federal court should assume that state procedures will afford an \nadequate remedy, in the absence of unambiguous authority to the contrary,” Pennzoil Co. v. \nTexaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 15 (1987).   \nIn sum, the Named Plaintiffs are party to ongoing state juvenile court proceedings that are \n“civil enforcement” proceedings, and those proceedings are pending, implicate important state \ninterests, and provide the Named Plaintiffs an adequate opportunity to raise the violations of \nfederal law that they raise in this case.  Accordingly, Younger requires this Court to abstain from \nhearing most of the Named Plaintiffs’ claims. \nIn Brian A., this Court declined to abstain under Younger, citing Hanna v. Toner for the \nproposition that “‘abstention from hearing claims of institutional violation of rights guaranteed by \nthe U.S. Constitution is inappropriate and federal courts must hear federal constitutional claims.’”  \nBrian A. v. Sundquist, 149 F. Supp. 2d 941, 957 (M.D. Tenn. 2000) (quoting Hanna v. Toner, 630 \nF.2d 442, 444 (6th Cir. 1980)).  However, this quote from Hanna is dicta.  Hanna did not hold that \n20 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 31 of 57 PageID #: 481\n\n \nYounger was inapplicable to constitutional claims, but rather declined to abstain because the “case \nrepresents no interference or intervention in state judicial processes.”  630 F.2d at 446.  Moreover, \nthe dicta in Hanna was referring to the Sixth Circuit’s earlier decision in Jones v. Metzger, which \ndid not even mention Younger and simply stated that courts should “hesitate” to abstain “when \nfundamental civil rights are at issue.”  456 F.2d 854, 856 (6th Cir. 1972) (citing McNeese v. Bd. of \nEduc., 373 U.S. 668 (1963)).  In fact, Younger itself involved a constitutional claim, 401 U.S. at \n41, 49, and the Sixth Circuit has held that abstention may be appropriate in cases involving \nconstitutional claims, see J.P. v. DeSanti, 653 F.2d 1080, 1085 (6th Cir. 1981); Doe, 860 F.3d at \n368. \nD.  The Court Should Abstain Under O’Shea.  \nUnder O’Shea v. Littleton, federal courts should abstain from hearing any claim when the \nplaintiff seeks “an injunction aimed at controlling or preventing the occurrence of specific events \nthat might take place in the course of” ongoing or future state court proceedings, such that the \nrelief the plaintiff seeks is effectively an “ongoing federal audit” of the state proceedings.  See 414 \nU.S. 488, 500 (1974); see, e.g., Oglala Sioux Tribe, 904 F.3d at 611–12 (citing O’Shea, 414 U.S. \nat 500); E.T. v. Cantil-Sakauye, 682 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir. 2012).  Unlike Younger abstention, \nthe application of O’Shea is not limited to certain categories of state court proceedings.  Disability \nRights N.Y. v. New York, 916 F.3d 129, 134–35 & n.3 (2d Cir. 2019). \nHere, Plaintiffs ask the Court to issue an injunction that would control future decisions \nmade by juvenile courts, including decisions relating to case planning and services.  If issued, the \ninjunction would “place the district court in the position of conducting an ongoing ‘federal audit’ \nof” juvenile courts to ensure their orders complied with the injunctive relief Plaintiffs request.  See \nOglala Sioux Tribe, 904 F.3d at 612; see also E.T., 682 F.3d at 1124 (abstaining under O’Shea \n21 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 32 of 57 PageID #: 482\n\n \nbecause “potential remediation might involve examination of the administration of a substantial \nnumber of individual cases”).  For example, Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring Defendants to: \n“ensure” all foster children “timely receive” all “services and/or treatments” in the case plan; \n“conduct[] reevaluations as the child’s circumstances change”; “timely” implement the case plan; \nand ensure all foster children receive “an adequate and individualized written case plan within 60 \ndays of entering care.”  ECF 25, at 75–79.  However, juvenile courts are charged with overseeing \nthe contents and implementation of a child’s case plan and the provision of services to foster \nchildren.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 37-2-403, 37-2-404, 37-2-406, 37-2-409; Tenn. R. Juv. P. 402, \n403; see also Advisory Commission Comments to Tenn. R. Juv. P. 401.  Accordingly, to ensure \ncompliance with the injunction Plaintiffs seek, this Court would need to review the thousands of \ncase planning and service-related decisions issued annually by juvenile courts, which would \namount to an “ongoing federal audit” of the state proceedings, see O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 500. \nII.  Alternatively, the Court Should Dismiss the Claims Under Rule 12(b)(6).  \nEven if it is not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the First Amended Complaint should be \ndismissed under Rule 12(b)(6). \nA.  The Claims Under the Spending Clause Statutes Fail as a Matter of Law \n(Third and Fifth Causes of Action).  \nPlaintiffs bring claims under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 \n(AACWA), 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq., and the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.  These claims \nshould be dismissed because the statutory provisions are not privately enforceable and, in any \nevent, Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts sufficient to show a violation of those provisions. \n1.  The AACWA and the Medicaid Act Provisions Are Not Privately \nEnforceable. \nAs the Supreme Court has explained, “the typical remedy for state noncompliance with \nfederally imposed conditions [in a Spending Clause statute] is not a private cause of action for \n22 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 33 of 57 PageID #: 483\n\n \nnoncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to terminate funds to the State.”  \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 183 (2023) (cleaned up).  Earlier \nthis year, in Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, the Court held that a Spending Clause \nstatute  must  “‘clear[ly]  and  unambiguous[ly]’  use[]  ‘rights-creating  terms’”  to  be  privately \nenforceable, 145 S. Ct. at 2229 (alteration in original) (quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. \n273, 290 (2009)), which is a “stringent standard.”  Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180, 184, 186.   \nIn Medina, the plaintiffs brought claims under the “any-qualified-provider” provision of \nthe Medicaid Act, which provides that the state Medicaid “plan” “must” “provide that . . . any \nindividual eligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from any institution, \nagency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required . . . \nwho undertakes to provide him such services.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A).  The Court held that, \neven though this statutory provision was mandatory and focused on the “individual,” it was not \nprivately enforceable because it did not contain the necessary “rights-creating language.”  Medina, \n145 S. Ct. at 2235–36.  The Court recognized that a less demanding standard was suggested in its \nprevious decisions in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, Blessing v. Freestone, and Wright \nv. Roanoke Redevelop and Housing Authority.  Id. at 2233–34.  The Court rejected the reasoning \nof these previous decisions and expressly instructed lower courts not to follow the reasoning in \nthose cases.  Id. at 2234. \nIn this case, the AACWA provisions on which Plaintiffs rely—42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(10), \n(a)(16), (a)(22), 675(1), (5)—are not privately enforceable because they do not “clearly and \nunambiguously use[] rights-creating terms,” Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2244.  Like the Medicaid Act’s \n“any-qualified-provider” provision, these AACWA provisions simply set forth requirements for \nwhat a state must include in its “plan” to be eligible for federal funding.  42 U.S.C. § 671(a).  \n23 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 34 of 57 PageID #: 484\n\n \nSpecifically, Section 671(a)(10) requires the “plan approved by the Secretary” to “provide[]” “for \nthe establishment or designation of a State authority or authorities that shall be responsible for \nestablishing and maintaining” certain “standards” for foster care placements; Section 671(a)(16) \nrequires the “plan” to “provide[]” for the development of a “case plan” defined in Section 675(1) \nand “for a case review system which meets the requirements described in sections 675(5) and \n675a” for each child receiving federal funding; and Section 671(a)(22) requires the “plan” to \n“provide[]” that “the State shall develop and implement standards to ensure that children in foster \ncare placements . . . are provided quality services that protect the safety and health of the children.”  \nId. §§ 671(a)(10), (a)(16), (a)(22). \nWhile these provisions “speak[] to what a State must do” to receive federal funding for \nfoster care maintenance payments, and may seek to “benefit” foster children, “missing from [these \nprovisions] is . . . clear and unambiguous ‘rights-creating language.’”  Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2235 \n(quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  In fact, even before Medina, the Sixth Circuit “easily \nconclude[d]” that Sections 671(a)(16), 675(1), and 675(5) “do[] not create enforceable rights.”  \nJohn B. v. Goetz, 626 F.3d 356, 363 (6th Cir. 2010).17  Brian A. held that certain provisions of \nAACWA are privately enforceable, but it was decided before John B. and Medina, and Brian A. \napplied the reasoning from Blessing, see Brian A., 149 F. Supp. 2d at 946–49, which the Supreme \nCourt expressly rejected in Medina. \nSimilarly, the Medicaid Act provisions on which Plaintiffs rely—42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8), \n(a)(10), (a)(43)(B)–(C), 1396d(a), (r)—are not privately enforceable because they do not “clearly \n \n17 Many other courts reached similar conclusions even before Talevski and Medina.  See, e.g., 31 \nFoster Child., 329 F.3d at 1274; D.G. ex rel. Stricklin v. Henry, 594 F. Supp. 2d 1273, 1280 (N.D. \nOkla. 2009); Carson P., 240 F.R.D. at 544; Olivia Y. v. Barbour, 351 F. Supp. 2d 543, 562 (S.D. \nMiss. 2004).  But see, e.g., Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1006–07 (9th Cir. 2012).   \n24 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 35 of 57 PageID #: 485\n\n \nand unambiguously use[] rights-creating terms,” Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2244.  Sections 1396a(a)(8), \n(a)(10), (a)(43)(B)–(C) provide that, to receive federal Medicaid funding: the “State plan . . . must” \n“provide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan \nshall have opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable \npromptness  to  all  eligible  individuals”;  the  “plan”  “must”  “provide”  that  certain  groups  of \nindividuals are eligible for Medicaid services; and the “plan” “must,” for certain individuals under \nage 21, “provide for . . . (B) providing or arranging for the provision of such screening services in \nall cases where they are requested, [and] (C) arranging for (directly or through referral to \nappropriate agencies, organizations, or individuals) corrective treatment the need for which is \ndisclosed by such child health screening services.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10), (a)(43)(B)–\n(C) .  And Sections 1396d(a) and (r) define “medical assistance” and “early and periodic screening, \ndiagnostic, and treatment services” (EPSDT).18 \nWhile these Medicaid Act provisions “speak[] to what a State must do to participate in” \nMedicaid, and may seek to “benefit” Medicaid enrollees, “missing from [these provisions] is . . . \nclear and unambiguous ‘rights-creating language.’”  Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2235 (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 186).  In fact, for purposes of analyzing whether they use “rights-creating language,” \nthese Medicaid Act provisions are indistinguishable from the Medicaid any-qualified-provider \nprovision in Medina, which the Supreme Court held does not create a private right of action.   \nIn Waskul v. Washtenaw County Community Mental Health, the Sixth Circuit held that \nSections 1396a(a)(8) and (a)(10) are privately enforceable.  979 F.3d 426, 447 (6th Cir. 2020).  \nHowever,  Waskul  applied  the  test  set  forth  in  Blessing  to  determine  whether  the  statutory \n \n18 Because Section 1396d(a) and (r) are definitional, they cannot independently create a private \nright of action.  See, e.g., A.M.H. v. Hayes, No. C2-03-778, 2004 WL 7076544 (S.D. Ohio Sept. \n30, 2004) (unpublished). \n25 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 36 of 57 PageID #: 486\n\n \nprovisions were privately enforceable, id. at 447, and Medina and Talevski require lower courts to \napply a different test.  In fact, Medina expressly instructs lower courts to avoid relying on the \nreasoning in Blessing.  145 S. Ct. at 2234.  Accordingly, Waskul has been superseded.19   \n2.  Plaintiffs  Fail  to  Allege  Facts  to  Establish  a  Violation  of  Section \n671(a)(10) or Section 671(a)(16). \nEven if the provisions of Sections 671(a) were privately enforceable, Plaintiffs fail to allege \nfacts to establish a violation of those statutes with respect to any of the Named Plaintiffs.  First, \nPlaintiffs do not allege facts establishing that the case planning provision of Section 671(a)(16) \napplies to any of the Named Plaintiffs.  Section 671(a)(16) applies only to children receiving \nfederally funded “foster care maintenance payments,” see id. § 671(a)(16), which are only \navailable for children who: meet certain financial eligibility requirements; are in a placement \nmeeting certain requirements; and have been removed from home pursuant to a court order that \nfinds, among other things, that “reasonable efforts” were made to preserve the family.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 672(a)(1)–(3); cf. T.M., ex rel. H.C. v. DeWine, 49 F.4th 1082, 1090 (6th Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat the state provides services to some foster children who do not receive federal funding).  The \nFirst Amended Complaint does not allege facts to show that any of the Named Plaintiffs meet these \nrequirements.   \nSecond, Plaintiffs fail to allege facts that show that DCS lacks “standards for foster family \nhomes and child care institutions which are reasonably in accord with recommended standards of \n \n19 In a different case, the Sixth Circuit found that a combination of several Medicaid provisions—\nincluding Sections 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10), and 1396d(r)(5)—create a private right.  Westside Mothers \nv. Haveman, 289 F.3d 852, 863 (6th Cir. 2002).  However, the Sixth Circuit later determined that \nconclusion was not binding, because the court found a private right based “generally [on] the \n‘screening and treatment provisions,’” and thus there was “no assurance that the panel considered \nwhether the specified provisions of the Medicaid Act confer enforceable rights.”  See Westside \nMothers v. Olszewski (Westside Mothers II), 454 F.3d 532, 539 (6th Cir. 2006). \n26 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 37 of 57 PageID #: 487\n\n \nnational organizations concerned with standards for the institutions or homes,” as specified in \nSection 671(a)(10).  That is, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants’ standards for approving foster \nhomes do not meet this requirement.  While Plaintiffs allege untimely certifications, see, e.g., ECF \n25 ¶ 62, Section 671(a)(10) does not mandate any timeline for approval of a foster home.   \n3.  Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Facts to Establish a Violation of the Medicaid \nAct. \nEven if Sections 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10), (a)(43)(B)–(C), and 1396d(a), (r) were privately \nenforceable, Plaintiffs do not allege facts to establish a violation of any of these statutes with \nrespect to any of the Named Plaintiffs.   \nAs explained above, Section 1396a(a)(10) provides that the state plan must “provide . . . \nfor making medical assistance available,” and Section 1396a(a)(8) requires that the state plan must \nprovide individuals with an “opportunity” to apply for “medical assistance,” and “that such \nassistance  shall  be  furnished  with  reasonable  promptness  to  all  eligible  individuals.”    Id. \n§ 1396a(a).  “The term ‘medical assistance’ means payment of part or all of the cost” of certain \n“care and services” specified in the Medicaid Act, or “the care and services themselves, or both.” \nId. § 1396d(a).  Accordingly, a state may “fulfill its Medicaid obligation” under Section 1396a \neither by providing the services itself or by agreeing to “pay[] for services” when delivered by a \nqualified provider.  See Nored v. Tenn. Dep’t of Intell. & Dev. Disabilities, No. 3:19-CV-00214-\nDCLC, 2021 WL 3729617, at *5 (E.D. Tenn. Aug. 23, 2021) (unpublished); see also Westside \nMothers v. Olszewski (Westside Mothers II), 454 F.3d 532, 540 (6th Cir. 2006) (“What is required \n[by Sections 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10)] is a prompt determination of eligibility and a prompt payment \nto eligible individuals to enable them to obtain the necessary medical services.” (cleaned up)); \nJohn B., 626 F.3d at 360 n.2 (explaining that “[a] state may still fulfill its Medicaid obligations” \nunder Sections 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10), and 1396d(a) “by paying for services”); K.B. ex rel. T.B. v. \n27 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 38 of 57 PageID #: 488\n\n \nMich. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 367 F. Supp. 3d 647, 657 (E.D. Mich. 2019) (“A state may \nchoose to only pay for services.”). \nIn this case, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants are failing to pay with “reasonable \npromptness” for any service for any Named Plaintiff, and thus they do not allege facts to support \na claim under Sections 1396a(a)(8) or (a)(10).  See Nored, 2021 WL 3729617, at *5.  Nor could \nPlaintiffs make such an allegation: the State pays for all medically necessary services for foster \nchildren that are coverable under the federal Medicaid statute.  See DCS Policy 20.7; Protocol for \nHealth Servs., at 7.  Plaintiffs do allege that Defendants are failing to ensure that certain services \nare in fact delivered to certain Named Plaintiffs, in part because of a lack of private providers \navailable to deliver certain services.  ECF 25 ¶¶ 31, 35, 78, 88, 127.  However, these allegations \ndo not give rise to a violation of Section 1396a(a)(8) or (a)(10).  If certain health care services are \nnot provided to a Named Plaintiff because of a lack of available providers, for example, that is not \n--\na violation of Section 1396a(a)(8) or (a)(10).  See Brown v. Tenn. Dep’t of Fin. & Admin., 561 \nF.3d 542, 545 (6th Cir. 2009) (“[A] waiting list for waiver services does not violate federal law \nbecause the state’s duty is to pay for services, not ensure they are provided.”).   \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs do not allege that the State failed to pay for any services for any Named \nPlaintiffs required by the Medicaid Act’s EPSDT provisions, Sections 1396a(a)(43)(B)–(C), \n1396d(a), (r).  Taken together, the EPSDT provisions require States to cover, for certain enrollees, \nmedically necessary services specifically enumerated in Section 1396d(a).  Parents’ League for \nEffective Autism Servs. v. Jones-Kelley, 339 F. App’x 542, 547 (6th Cir. 2009) (unpublished).  \nSection 1396d(a), in turn, lists dozens of categories of services, such as inpatient hospital services, \noutpatient  hospital  services,  prescribed  drugs,  physician  services,  certain  therapies,  and \nrehabilitative services.  Id. § 1396d(a).  However, the First Amended Complaint does not allege \n28 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 39 of 57 PageID #: 489\n\n \nthat the State is failing to pay for any specific service listed in Section 1396d(a) for any Named \nPlaintiff.  Plaintiffs allege that some Named Plaintiffs did not, at certain points in the past, have \n“access” to certain “mental health” services, see ECF 25 ¶¶ 35, 55, 125, 159, but the First Amended \nComplaint generally does not identify what those specific services were, allege that those services \nfall within one of the enumerated categories in Section 1396d(a), or allege that the State would \nrefuse to cover them if a provider was available to deliver them.20  Further, most of this alleged \nlack of “access” to unspecified “mental health” services occurred in the past, which is insufficient \nto establish an ongoing harm necessary to support a claim for future injunctive relief.  See Tenn. \nConf. of NAACP, 139 F.4th at 568.  \nB.  The Substantive Due Process Claims Fail as a Matter of Law (First Cause of \nAction).  \nThe Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides that no state shall “deprive any \nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1. \nThis language speaks only to process and does not create any substantive rights, and therefore \nPlaintiffs’ “Substantive Due Process” claims in this case are not supported by the text of the Due \nProcess Clause.  See, e.g., Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 331–32 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., concurring) (“[T]he Due Process Clause at most guarantees process.  It does not, as \nthe Court’s substantive due process cases suppose, ‘forbi[d] the government to infringe certain \nfundamental liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided.’”  (alteration in original) \n(quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993)). \n \n20 Plaintiffs allege that Jasmine G. did not receive “attachment therapy,” ECF 25 ¶ 77, and that \nAlice W. and Gavin W. did not receive “play therapy,” id. ¶ 159.  However, Plaintiffs do not allege \nthat the State refused to pay for these services if there was a provider available to deliver them.   \n29 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 40 of 57 PageID #: 490\n\n \nHowever, Defendants acknowledge that a controversial line of Supreme Court precedent \nbinding on this Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause to “provide[]substantive, as well as \nprocedural, protection[s] for ‘liberty.’”  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 237.  These substantive protections \ninclude most of the “rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments” as well as “a select list of \nfundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution.”  Id. \nThe Supreme Court has been “reluctant to expand” the list of unenumerated due process \nrights “because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this uncharted area are scarce and \nopen-ended.’” Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992).  The Substantive Due \nProcess doctrine creates a risk of courts “substitut[ing] their social and economic beliefs for the \njudgment of legislative bodies.” Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 237 (quotations omitted).  Mindful of this \n“temptation,” L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 475 (6th Cir.), aff’d sub nom. United \nStates v. Skrmetti, 606 U.S. --,145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025), the Supreme Court has imposed strictures \non the recognition of unenumerated rights.  First, courts analyze the asserted right at “the most \nspecific level” of abstraction.  Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 127 n.6 (1989) (plurality).  \n“Level of generality is everything in constitutional law.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 475.  By requiring a \n“careful description” of the asserted right, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997), \nthe court ensures that the Due Process Clause protects only those rights agreed to at the time of \nratification.  Clark v. Jackson, 2023 WL 2787325, at *5 (6th Cir. 2023); see L.W., 83 F.4th at 475.  \nSecond, courts require the right asserted to be “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” and \n“deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”  Dobbs, 597 U.S at 238 (quotation marks \nomitted).  This is, “[t]o say the least, . . . a tough test.”  Chambers v. Sanders, 63 F.4th 1092, 1096 \n(6th Cir. 2023) (quotations omitted).  Rightfully so.  “Grounding new substantive due process \n30 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 41 of 57 PageID #: 491\n\n \nrights in historically rooted customs is the only way to prevent life-tenured federal judges from \nseeing every heart-felt policy dispute as an emerging constitutional right.” L.W., 83 F.4th at 477. \nIn the foster care context, the Supreme Court has recognized a narrow band of substantive \nrights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause, i.e., the right to “basic human needs—e.g., food, \nclothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety.”  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep’t of \nSoc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989).  Tennessee state law and policy appropriately require \nDefendants to provide foster children with much more than “basic human needs,” and Defendants \ndevote enormous resources to doing so.  However, the constitutional protections are limited to \nensuring the “basic human needs.”  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs take “aspirational statutory, regulatory, and private standards as to a \nvariety of topics within the overall complex of foster child care” and attempt to “convert each of \nthem to constitutional requirements.”  Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 774 F.3d 45, 55 (1st \nCir. 2014).  But the “rights” Plaintiffs advance are not “fundamental to our scheme of ordered \nliberty” and “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 238. \nPlaintiffs assert a litany of rights, including a right to be free of “maltreatment,” rights to a \ncertain type or length of custodial arrangement or placement, and rights to certain types of services, \nincluding education.  See, e.g., ECF 25 ¶ 276.  However, Plaintiffs do not set forth these supposed \n“rights” at “the most specific level” of abstraction, Michael H., 491 U.S. at 127 n.6, but instead \ndescribe them with vague and amorphous terms, such as “protection from unnecessary intrusions \ninto  the  child’s  emotional  and  psychological  well-being”;  “services  necessary  to  prevent \nunreasonable and unnecessary intrusions into the child’s emotional and psychological well-being”; \n“conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the purpose of government custody”; \n“treatment and care consistent with the purpose and assumptions of government custody”; “in \n31 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 42 of 57 PageID #: 492\n\n \ncustody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into \ngovernment custody”; and “minimally adequate education,” see ECF ¶ 276.  Further, none of these \n“rights” are “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” and “deeply rooted in this Nation’s \nhistory and tradition.”  See Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 238.  There is no evidence that, at the time the \nFourteenth Amendment was enacted, that it was “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and \ntradition” to guarantee orphans or any other children a “right” to “protection from unnecessary \nintrusions into the child’s emotional and psychological well-being” or a “right” to “services \nnecessary to prevent unreasonable and unnecessary intrusions into the child’s emotional and \npsychological well-being,” for example.   \nIn Reno v. Flores, consistent with the limited scope of substantive protections created by \nthe Due Process Clause, the Supreme Court held that Substantive Due Process does not provide \ndetained migrant children with the right to be placed in a family home with a nonrelative custodian, \nrather than in an institution.  507 U.S. at 302.  The Court expressly addressed the consequence a \ncontrary holding would have for state child welfare systems:  \nIf  there  exists  a  fundamental  right  to  be  released  into  what \nrespondents  inaccurately  call  a  “non-custodial  setting,” . . .   [i]t \nwould  presumably  apply  to  state  custody  over  orphans  and \nabandoned children as well, giving federal law and federal courts a \nmajor new role in the management of state orphanages and other \nchild-care institutions . . . .  The mere novelty of such a claim is \nreason enough to doubt that “substantive due process” sustains it[.] \nId.   \n32 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 43 of 57 PageID #: 493\n\n \nFor all of these reasons, many courts have rejected the argument that Substantive Due \nProcess protects a “right” to a type and duration of foster care placement,21 “right” to services \nbeyond basic medical care,22 or a right to education.23  \nIn any event, Plaintiffs fail to allege facts to establish a violation of any of the “rights” they \nadvance with respect to any of the Named Plaintiffs.  To prove a Substantive Due Process claim, \na plaintiff must prove that: (1) the plaintiffs were deprived of a cognizable constitutional right; (2) \nthe defendants’ actions “shocked the conscience” and constituted “deliberate indifference”; and \n(3)  the  defendants’  conscience-shocking  deliberate  indifference  caused  the  constitutional \ndeprivation.  See, e.g., Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846–50 (1998); Siefert, 951 \nF.3d at 765–67; Eidson v. Tenn. Dep’t of Children’s Servs., 510 F.3d 631, 636 (6th Cir. 2007); \nMeador v.

Colo. Dep’t \nof Corr., 455 F.3d 1146, 1151 (10th Cir. 2006); Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 51 F.3d 1137, 1149 \n(3d Cir. 1995).   \nTo prove that the defendants’ actions were “deliberately indifferent,” the plaintiffs must \nprove that the defendants “recklessly disregarded a risk so obvious that they either knew or should \nhave known of it.”  Lawler ex rel. Lawler v. Hardeman Cnty., 93 F.4th 919, 926–27 (6th Cir. 2024) \n(cleaned up).  “Mere negligence is insufficient” to “establish deliberate indifference.”  Brawner v. \nScott Cnty., 14 F.4th 585, 596 (6th Cir. 2021). \nIn this case, to the extent any asserted right is constitutionally cognizable, Plaintiffs’ \nallegations fail to show that Defendants’ actions are “deliberately indifferent” with respect to any \nof the Named Plaintiffs, or that those actions are causing any of the Named Plaintiffs to suffer a \nconstitutional injury.  To begin with, Plaintiffs do not allege that any of the Named Plaintiffs are \ncurrently experiencing maltreatment or face a substantial risk of imminent maltreatment, except \nfor Thomas H.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to support a Substantive Due Process \nclaim based on a deprivation of this alleged “right to freedom from maltreatment” for any of the \nNamed Plaintiffs, except for Thomas H.  Plaintiffs also do not allege any facts that show, with \nrespect to any Named Plaintiff, that Defendants are “recklessly disregard[ing]” a “substantial risk \nof harm” that is so obvious that Defendants “either knew or should have known of it.”  The First \nAmended Complaint alleges that the Named Plaintiffs have experienced injuries that, if true, are \nunacceptable to Defendants.  However, Plaintiffs fail to identify any ongoing (or even past) actions \nthat would constitute “deliberate indifference” with respect to the Named Plaintiffs’ alleged \n“rights” to personal safety and security.  Nor are Plaintiffs’ generic and conclusory allegations \nabout the performance of the child welfare system sufficient to establish a Substantive Due Process \n34 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 45 of 57 PageID #: 495\n\n \nviolation.  See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (“A plaintiff’s obligation to \nprovide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions.”). \nC.  The Familial Association Claims Fail as a Matter of Law (Second Cause of \nAction).  \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated their “rights to a permanent home and \nfamilial association” based on the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.  \nECF 25 ¶ 279.  That is, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants have an affirmative constitutional \nobligation to find all foster children a permanent home and family.   \nThe Court should dismiss this claim because the Supreme Court has never “broached—\nmuch less recognized—this affirmative duty.”  Jonathan R. v. Justice, No. 3:19-cv-00710, 2023 \nWL 184960, at *11 (S.D.W. Va. Jan. 13, 2023) (unpublished).  As a policy matter, Defendants \nprioritize achieving timely permanency for all foster children and devote enormous resources to \nachieving that goal.  However, courts have rejected the argument that the Constitution imposes an \naffirmative duty on states to identify and provide a permanent home for a child.  See, e.g., Gary \nG.  v.  Newsom,  No.  5:23-cv-00947,  2024  WL  4354697,  at  *12  (C.D. Cal.  Sept.  30,  2024) \n(unpublished); Ocean S. v. Los Angeles Cnty., 2024 WL 3973047 (C.D. Cal. June 11, 2024) \n(unpublished); Jonathan R., 2023 WL 184960, at *11–*13. \nD.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act Claims Fail as a Matter of Law (Fourth \nCause of Action).  \nTitle II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 12132.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act imposes similar requirements, and thus the \nstatutes are often analyzed together.  Thompson v. Williamson Cnty., 219 F.3d 555, 557 n.3 (6th \nCir. 2000).  Plaintiffs do not contend that Defendants are excluding children with disabilities from \n35 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 46 of 57 PageID #: 496\n\n \ntheir programs but rather assert that Defendants are violating the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \nbecause foster children “have been or are at risk of being placed in overly restrictive settings,” \nECF 25 ¶ 294.  \nThese claims should be dismissed because the ADA and Section 504 do not prohibit “risk \nof” placement in segregated settings, and Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to establish that \nDefendants are causing any of the Named Plaintiffs to experience “unjustified institutionalization” \nor a serious risk of such institutionalization.   \n1.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act Do Not Prohibit “Risk of” Unjustified \nInstitutionalization.  \nIn Olmstead v. L.C., two plaintiffs institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital brought ADA \nclaims against a state, and the Supreme Court held that a state subjecting an individual to \n“unjustified institutionalization” could violate the ADA’s prohibition on discrimination in certain \ncircumstances.    527  U.S.  581  (1999).    In  the  decades  following  Olmstead,  several  courts \nsubstantially expanded Olmstead by concluding that the ADA also prohibits state action that \ncauses a “serious risk of” unjustified institutionalization.  See, e.g., Waskul, 979 F.3d at 461; M.R. \nv. Dreyfus, 663 F.3d 1100, 1116–17 (9th Cir. 2011), opinion amended and superseded on denial \nof reh’g, 697 F.3d 706 (9th Cir. 2012).  To arrive at this interpretation, these courts did not closely \nexamine the text of the ADA, but deferred to guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \nthat “sufficient risk of institutionalization” violated the ADA.24  See, e.g., Pashby v. Delia, 709 \nF.3d 307, 322–23 (4th Cir. 2013).   \n \n24 DOJ, Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title \nII  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  and  Olmstead  v.

Raimondo  squarely  forbids  deference  to  such  agency \ninterpretations of statutes and therefore supersedes these decisions.  603 U.S. 369, 399–401, 412 \n(2024).  Instead, “[c]ourts must exercise their independent judgment” in interpreting statutes.  Id.  \nRegardless of any ambiguity in the statute, the Court must find the “best reading of the statute”—\ni.e., “the reading the court would have reached if no agency were involved”––using traditional \ntools of statutory construction.  Id. at 400–01 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nIn Waskul, the Sixth Circuit held that plaintiffs may “state a claim by sufficiently alleging \nthat they are at serious risk of institutionalization.”  979 F.3d at 461.  In reaching that conclusion, \nthe court relied on DOJ regulations and the DOJ sub-regulatory guidance interpreting the ADA.  \nSee id. at 459–61.  The court did not decide whether those DOJ interpretations were entitled to \ndeference  because  the  defendants  in  Waskul  “d[id]  not  dispute  the  DOJ’s  interpretation  of \nOlmstead or that Plaintiffs can sustain a claim simply by showing that they are at serious risk of \ninstitutionalization,” and a contrary reading of DOJ regulations would be “unreasonable.”  Id. at \n461.  Waskul did not, as Loper Bright now requires, examine the text of the ADA to determine the \n“best reading” “the court would have reached if no agency were involved.”  603 U.S. at 400. \n(internal quotations marks omitted).  Accordingly, Waskul is inconsistent with Loper Bright, and \nthis Court need not follow it.  United States v. Elbe, 774 F.3d 885, 891 (6th Cir. 2014) (explaining \nthat a panel decision is no longer controlling authority if it is “inconsistent [with a] decision of the \nUnited States Supreme Court”). \nWith the Supreme Court lifting the fog of deference that has long precluded courts from \nindependently analyzing the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, these statutes clearly do not prohibit \na “serious risk of” unjustified institutionalization.  The relevant provision of the ADA reads: “[N]o \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded  from \n37 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 48 of 57 PageID #: 498\n\n \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, \nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The relevant provision \nof the Rehabilitation Act similarly reads: “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .”  29 U.S.C. § 794. \nThese statutes prohibit “discrimination,” not a “risk of” discrimination.  As the Fifth Circuit \nheld, nothing in the text of the ADA “suggests that a risk of institutionalization, without actual \ninstitutionalization, constitutes actionable discrimination.”  United States v. Mississippi, 82 F.4th \n387, 392 (5th Cir. 2023).  The ADA “does not define discrimination in terms of a prospective risk \nto qualified disabled individuals.”  Id.  Rather, “[i]n stating that no individual shall be ‘excluded,’ \n‘denied,’  or  ‘subjected  to  discrimination,’  the  statute  refers  to  the  actual,  not  hypothetical \nadministration of public programs.”  Id.  Nor does Olmstead support reading the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act as prohibiting “serious risk of” “unjustifiable institutionalization.”  Olmstead \ninvolved two individual plaintiffs who were in fact institutionalized, and it thus “turn[ed] on actual \n‘unjustifiable institutionalization,’ not on hypothetical future events.”  Mississippi, 82 F.4th at 394. \nLikewise, DOJ’s regulations implementing the ADA do not prohibit “serious risk of” \ninstitutionalization.  DOJ’s “integration mandate” regulation reads in full: “A public entity shall \nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs \nof qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  Nothing in this text suggests \nthat a “risk of” institutionalization is discrimination.  DOJ’s contrary interpretation of its regulation \nis not supported by the regulatory text and is not entitled to deference.  In Kisor v. Wilkie, the \nSupreme Court limited deference to agency regulatory interpretations to situations where the \n38 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 49 of 57 PageID #: 499\n\n \n“regulation is genuinely ambiguous” about the question at issue, “even after a court has resorted \nto all the standard tools of interpretation.”  588 U.S. 558, 573–75 (2019).  In this case, DOJ’s \nregulations are not “genuinely ambiguous”: Like the ADA itself, Section 35.130 does not prohibit \n“risk of” of segregation or unjustified institutionalization.  Accordingly, Kisor precludes any \ndeference to DOJ’s interpretation of Section 35.130(d) as prohibiting “serious risk of” unjustified \ninstitutionalization.  Mississippi, 82 F.4th at 393–94.  Further, even if DOJ’s regulations prohibited \n“serious  risk  of”  unjustified  institutionalization,  they  would  be  ultra  vires  and  invalid  as \ninconsistent with the text of the ADA.  See, e.g., Bowman v. United States, 564 F.3d 765, 769 (6th \nCir. 2008). \nIn contrast to DOJ’s regulations, HHS’s regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act \nwere amended last year to prohibit “serious risk of” unjustified institutionalization.25  See 45 \nC.F.R. § 84.76 (effective Jul. 8, 2024).  However, HHS promulgated that regulation “to promote \nconsistency with” the ADA, DOJ’s implementing regulations, DOJ’s sub-regulatory guidance, and \ncourt decisions deferring to DOJ’s interpretation.  Proposed Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. 63392, 63393, \n63482 & nn.514, 515, 520 (Sept. 14, 2023).  HHS’s interpretation of the Rehabilitation Act \nreflected in these regulations is not entitled to deference after Loper Bright, and it is not the “best \nreading of the statute.”  See 603 U.S. at 400.  The Rehabilitation Act prohibits “discrimination,” \nnot a “risk of” discrimination.  Further, the Rehabilitation Act does not even prohibit actual \n“unjustified institutionalization”: as the Supreme Court observed in Olmstead, “[u]nlike the \nADA,” the Rehabilitation Act “contains no express recognition that isolation or segregation of \npersons with disabilities is a form of discrimination.”  See 527 U.S. at 600 n.11.  Accordingly, \n \n25 This regulation is currently the subject of litigation, and the case is stayed while the federal \ngovernment considers whether it will continue to defend the regulation.  See Order, Texas v. \nBecerra, No. 5:24-cv-225 (N.D. Tex. August 5, 2025), ECF 70 (attached as Ex. 9). \n39 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 50 of 57 PageID #: 500\n\n \nHHS’s regulations are ultra vires and invalid as contrary to the statute.  See, e.g., Bowman, 564 \nF.3d at 769. \nIn any event, to the extent Plaintiffs rely on DOJ or HHS regulations to support their “at \nrisk” theory of liability, regulations cannot create a private cause of action.  “[F]ederal regulations \npromulgated pursuant to [] statutes are . . . incapable of independently conferring” private rights.  \nJohnson v. City of Detroit, 446 F.3d 614, 629 (6th Cir. 2006).  “Language in a regulation may \ninvoke a private right of action that Congress through statutory text created, but it may not create \na right that Congress has not.”  Caswell v. City of Detroit Hous. Comm’n, 418 F.3d 615, 618 (6th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 291 (2001)).  As explained above, the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit discrimination, but they do not prohibit “risk of” \ndiscrimination.  See supra.  Therefore, even if DOJ or HHS has authority to implement regulations \nto prohibit a “serious risk of” unjustified institutionalization, Plaintiffs cannot rely on those \nregulations to bring a claim in federal court.  Cf. Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286 (holding that Title VI \ndoes not confer a private right of action to enforce regulations, even though regulations themselves \nwere valid); Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 913–14 (6th Cir. \n2004) (holding that regulation requiring “transition plans” to make facilities more accessible “does \nmore than simply apply or effectuate” the ADA and “therefore, it is not enforceable under Title \nII’s private cause of action”). \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ interpretation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is also inconsistent \nwith Alexander v.  Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985) and Olmstead.   In  Alexander, Tennessee’s \nMedicaid program decreased coverage of inpatient hospital care from 20 days to 14 days, which \nthe plaintiffs argued discriminated against individuals with disabilities because it had a disparate \nimpact.  Balancing “the need to give effect to the statutory objectives and the desire to keep § 504 \n40 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 51 of 57 PageID #: 501\n\n \nwithin  manageable  bounds,”  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  Tennessee  did  not  violate  the \nRehabilitation Act because the policy “does not deny the handicapped access to or exclude them \nfrom the particular package of Medicaid services” and “made the same benefit—14 days of \ncoverage—equally accessible to both handicapped and nonhandicapped persons,” and “the State \nis not required to assure the handicapped ‘adequate health care’ . . . .”  Id. at 299, 309.  The Court \n“reject[ed] the boundless notion that all disparate-impact showings constitute prima facie cases \nunder § 504.”  Id. at 292, 299.  Similarly, in Olmstead, the Court expressly rejected the notion that \n“the ADA requires States to provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities.”  \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14 (cleaned up).  As in Alexander, Plaintiffs in this case do not allege \nthat Defendants “deny” or “exclude” the Named Plaintiffs from any Medicaid service, but instead \nallege that Defendants are causing “serious risk of” unjustified institutionalization because they do \nnot ensure that all Named Plaintiffs receive a sufficient amount of community-based services.  \nHowever, Alexander and Olmstead held that the statutes do not require states to provide individuals \nwith “adequate health care” or a “certain level of benefits.”   \nIn this case, Plaintiffs do not allege that 14 of the Named Plaintiffs—Amara G., Zane G., \nAaron C., Arielle H., Ava C., Andrew C., Adrian H., Zander M.,  Dewayne W., Jonah W., Sarah \nW., Adam D., Alice W., and Gavin W.—are in “institutional,” “restrictive,” or “segregated \nsettings,” but allege only that they face some amorphous “risk of” such placement.  Because “risk \nof” unjustified institutionalization is not actionable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims of these 14 Named Plaintiffs should be dismissed, along with \nany class claims based on allegations of “risk of” such institutionalization or segregation. \n41 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 52 of 57 PageID #: 502\n\n \n2.  Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Facts to Support an ADA or Rehabilitation Act \nClaim. \nIn Olmstead, two institutionalized plaintiffs sought to move into the community, which the \nState’s treatment professionals determined was appropriate, but the State declined to enroll the \nplaintiffs in an existing community-based services program, thereby prolonging the plaintiffs’ \ninstitutionalization.  527 U.S. 581.  Under those facts, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs \ncould establish a violation of the ADA by proving that the state’s action caused them to experience \n“unjustified institutionalization.”  Id. at 587, 600–07.  However, the Supreme Court held that \ninstitutionalization is only “unjustified” if: “the State’s treatment professionals” conclude that \ncommunity  placement  is  “appropriate”;  the  plaintiff  prefers  community  placement;  and  the \ncommunity placement “can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources \navailable to the State and the needs of others with . . . disabilities.”  See id. at 587, 607. \nAccordingly, to plead an ADA violation under Olmstead, Plaintiffs in this case must allege \nfacts that show: (1) Defendants’ refusal to pay for community-based services cause the Named \nPlaintiff to be institutionalized (or, under Plaintiffs’ theory, face a “serious risk” thereof); (2) the \nNamed Plaintiff’s legal guardian prefers the child to be placed in the community; (3) “the State’s \ntreatment  professionals”  concluded  that  the  Named  Plaintiff  is  appropriate  for  community \nplacement;  and  (4)  community  placement  of  the  Named  Plaintiff  can  be  “reasonably \naccommodated.”  \nPlaintiffs have not alleged facts to support these elements of their claims for any of the \nNamed Plaintiffs.  To begin with, Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants declined to pay for \nany community-based services for any of the Named Plaintiffs or otherwise took any action that \ndenies any Named Plaintiff such services.  To the contrary, the First Amended Complaint suggests \nthat a constellation of circumstances—many of which are outside the control of Defendants—\n42 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 53 of 57 PageID #: 503\n\n \ncause some Named Plaintiffs to remain or be placed in residential treatment or create a “serious \nrisk of” such placement.  See ECF 25 ¶¶ 34–35, 50–51, 54–55, 69.  When placement in residential \ntreatment is caused by the lack of third-party providers willing to serve a child in the community, \nfor example, there is no causal link between state action and the alleged harm of residential \ntreatment.  In contrast, Olmstead involved institutionalization caused by the defendants’ act of not \npaying for community-based services for the two plaintiffs.   \nIn addition, the First Amended Complaint does not allege that the legal guardians of any \nof the five Named Plaintiffs allegedly placed in residential treatment (Darnell H., Max W., Thomas \nH., Keira M., and Jasmine G.) would prefer for the Named Plaintiff to be placed in the community, \nand it does not allege that “the State’s treatment professionals” determined that a community-based \nplacement is “appropriate” for three of the five Named Plaintiffs allegedly placed in residential \ntreatment (Keira M., Jasmine G., and Max W.).  In fact, Plaintiffs allege that Max W. should be \nplaced in residential treatment.  ECF 25 ¶ 143. \nFinally, Plaintiffs do not allege facts that establish that three of the five Named Plaintiffs \nallegedly  placed  in  residential  treatment—Darnell  H.,  Max  W.,  and  Thomas  H.—can  be \n“reasonably accommodated” in the community.  Plaintiffs do not allege, for example, that there is \na foster family willing to accept any of these three Named Plaintiffs.  In fact, the First Amended \nComplaint suggests that placing Darnell in the community cannot be reasonably accommodated at \nthis time: DCS has twice placed Darnell in family homes, but both of those placements disrupted.  \nSee ECF 25 ¶ 50–51, 54–55.  And, again, Plaintiffs allege that Max W. should not be placed in the \ncommunity at this time.  ECF 25 ¶¶ 143, 148. \n43 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 54 of 57 PageID #: 504\n\n \nE.  Plaintiffs  Do  Not  Allege  They  Exhausted  Their  Claims  Through  the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act’s (IDEA) Administrative Process \n(First and Fourth Causes of Action). \nA plaintiff “‘seeking relief that is also available’” under the IDEA must first exhaust the \nIDEA’s administrative process before bringing claims in federal court “‘under the Constitution, \nthe ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities.’”  Doe by K.M. v. Knox Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 56 F.4th 1076, 1080–81 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l)).  The IDEA allows relief for “the denial of a free appropriate public \neducation.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, children with disabilities cannot \nbring federal claims seeking a “free appropriate public education” before exhausting the IDEA’s \nadministrative process. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have denied Named Plaintiffs and absent class \nmembers  with  disabilities  an  appropriate  public  education  in  violation  of  the  ADA,  the \nRehabilitation Act, and Substantive Due Process, and they seek relief requiring Defendants to \nprovide such educational services to them.  See, e.g., ECF 25 ¶¶ 49–50, 118–19, 126, 128, 155, \n243–47, 276(g), 282(f), 291, 294.  However, Plaintiffs do not allege that any of the Named \nPlaintiffs  or  absent  class  members  have  exhausted  the  administrative  process  under  the \nIDEA.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and Substantive Due Process claims \nshould be dismissed to the extent they rely on the allegation that Defendants have failed to provide \nappropriate educational services.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor all the reasons set forth above, the First Amended Complaint should be dismissed. \n \n \n \n44 \n \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 37     Filed 09/05/25     Page 55 of 57 PageID #: 505\n\n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n September 5, 2025  /s/Philip Peisch    \nPhilip J.

Tennessee’s foster care system is failing the children it is intended to protect. \nTennessee’s Department of Children’s Services (“DCS”) warehouses children in spaces which \nlack the basic necessities of life, including adequate food, bedding, soap, and potable water. \nIntended as temporary placements, DCS leaves children in these situations for months on end. \nOnce placed in ‘long-term’ placements, children fare no better. DCS contracts with facilities which \npossess well-known track records of physical, mental, and sexual abuse. Children are placed in \nfoster homes that have not been properly vetted, do not receive necessary information about the \nchildren, and do not receive the services necessary to care for them. Foster care is intended to be \ntemporary, until children can either be reunited with their families or placed in another permanent \nhome; however, children in Tennessee linger in foster care and are moved from place to place \nwithout the opportunity for a stable childhood.  \n2.  The caseworkers required to support and protect foster children are overworked and \nundertrained. Due to crushing caseloads, DCS caseworkers are unable to reliably perform the basic \nduties necessary to oversee the well-being of the foster children assigned to their care. As \nconcluded by a state audit in 2022, “[t]he safety, permanency, and well-being of Tennessee’s most \nvulnerable children is in jeopardy.” \n3.  DCS’s dereliction of care is no mere oversight or mistake. It has been previously \nsued in federal court for violating the rights of foster children. As a result of the suit, DCS improved \nmany  aspects  of  the  foster  care  system,  until  the  court  ended  its  jurisdiction  over  DCS’s \nperformance metrics in 2017. However, eight years later, the state of Tennessee’s child welfare \nsystem is just as bad, if not worse, than the crisis which engendered the previous lawsuit. \n2 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 2 of 74 PageID #: 2\n\n \n4.  In 2000, a putative federal class action lawsuit was filed against Tennessee’s child \nwelfare system, asserting that the system that was supposed to protect and benefit children was \ninstead violating their constitutional and federal statutory rights. Brian A., et al. v. Bredesen, et al., \nCase No. 3:00-CV-00445 (“Brian A.”). After a failed effort to dismiss the lawsuit, the Brian A. \ndefendants—the Governor of Tennessee and the Commissioner of DCS—agreed to a settlement \npursuant to which they would implement systematic reform (the “Brian A. Settlement”). Under \nthe terms of the Brian A. Settlement, the State defendants agreed that the Middle District of \nTennessee would have continuing jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the Brian A. Settlement, \nand that such jurisdiction would terminate when the State defendants had accomplished certain \nexit criteria—criteria designed to ensure that the State defendants were upholding their basic \nobligations to children in the State’s custody, and that children’s fundamental rights were being \nprotected.  \n5.  Over the next decade, in compliance with the Brian A. Settlement and under court \nsupervision, the State made substantial changes to its child welfare system, which resulted in a \nsignificant  improvement  in  the  lives  of  children  in  the  State’s  custody.  As  former  DCS \nCommissioner Jim Henry later acknowledged: “We’ve got to be honest: we didn’t have a system \nhere in 2000. I mean, we deserved to get a lawsuit. The fact is, we’re a much better system now. \nWe’re better off for it, the kids are better off, and I think the taxpayers are better off.” \n6.  After  16  years  of  court-supervised  reform,  in  2017,  the  Middle  District  of \nTennessee determined that the State defendants had satisfied the performance metric criteria \nidentified in the Brian A. Settlement, and agreed to dismiss the majority of the lawsuit, ending the \ncourt’s oversight of DCS’s performance.  \n3 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 3 of 74 PageID #: 3\n\n \n7.  Things quickly declined in the absence of court supervision. Within just a few \nyears, the hard-fought changes mandated by Brian A. all but vanished, and DCS is once again \ndepriving children of their basic rights—rights that are protected by the U.S. Constitution, as well \nas by federal statutes.  \n8.  Once again, Tennessee children in need of care and protection are being denied \ntheir constitutional and federal statutory rights and are placed at substantial risk of serious harm as \na result of Defendants’ actions and inactions.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n10.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  Plaintiffs’  federal  claims  pursuant  to  28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2002 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n12.  Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial \npart of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District, and \nDefendants maintain offices and conduct business in this District. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n14.  This action consists of one general class and one subclass; each class is sufficiently \nnumerous to make joinder impracticable. The general class consists of at least 9,000 children who \nare in the legal and/or physical custody of DCS and/or with whom DCS has a special relationship \n4 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 4 of 74 PageID #: 4\n\n \n(the “General Class”). The subclass consists of the thousands of General Class members who have \nor will have emotional, psychological, cognitive, or physical disabilities (the “ADA Subclass”).  \nNumerosity: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n15.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The General \nClass consists of at least 9,000 children who are or will be in the legal and/or physical custody \nof DCS and/or with whom DCS has a special relationship.  \n16.  The ADA Subclass consists of thousands of children with disabilities who are or \nwill be in the legal and/or physical custody of DCS and/or with whom DCS has a special \nrelationship.  \nTypicality: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3)  \n \n17.  The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are representative of those of the General Class \nand/or the ADA Subclass, as they stem from the same policies, practices, or patterns of conduct, \nand are grounded in the same legal theories as the General Class and/or the ADA Subclass’s \nclaims. \n18.  The questions of fact and law raised by Named Plaintiffs are common and typical \nof each putative member of the classes whom they seek to represent.  \n19.  Questions of fact common to the General Class include:  \na.  Whether Defendants fail to provide children in Tennessee state custody with \nsafe, secure, and appropriate foster care placements as required by law and \nreasonable professional standards;  \nb.  Whether Defendants fail to provide and implement legally mandated case \nplans, including plans for permanent placement; \n5 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 5 of 74 PageID #: 5\n\n \nc.  Whether Defendants fail to provide children with legally required services, \nconsistent with reasonable professional standards, necessary to prevent \nthem  from  deteriorating  physically,  psychologically,  emotionally,  and \neducationally;  \nd.  Whether Defendants fail to conduct timely mental and physical evaluations \nof children who enter the State’s custody;  \ne.  Whether Defendants fail to maintain a case management system capable of \nadequately protecting foster children; \nf.  Whether Defendants fail to maintain a system that protects foster children \nfrom physical, psychological, and emotional harm; and \ng.  Whether Defendants fail to maintain a system that provides permanency to \nchildren within a reasonable period of time. \n20.  Questions of law common to the General Class include:  \na.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ substantive due \nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;  \nb.  Whether  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate  Plaintiffs’  rights  to  a \npermanent home and family, as well as their rights to be free from harm and \nhave  their  basic  needs  met,  under  the  First,  Ninth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution; \nc.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997; and  \n6 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 6 of 74 PageID #: 6\n\n \nd.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nMedicaid Act. \n21.  Questions of fact common to the ADA Subclass include: \na.  Whether Defendants supervise the State’s foster care system in a manner \nthat denies qualified children with disabilities the benefits of the State’s \nservices, programs, or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto their needs, and; \nb.  Whether Defendants fail to reasonably modify the State’s foster care system \nto avoid discrimination against children with disabilities. \n22.  Questions of law common to the ADA Subclass include: \na.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and their respective \nimplementing regulations by unnecessarily placing youth with disabilities \nin institutional settings, or placing them at risk thereof, instead of providing \nreasonable accommodations in community-based and/or least restrictive \nsettings;  denying  them  access  to  meaningful,  individualized,  and \nappropriate community-based treatment and support which would enable \nchildren with disabilities to remain in the community; and failing to ensure \nthat state and local officials make available a full range of home- and \ncommunity-based placements, as well as the necessary and appropriate \ncommunity-based  services,  which  would  guarantee  access  to  the  least \nrestrictive and most integrated setting appropriate to their needs; and  \n7 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 7 of 74 PageID #: 7\n\n \nb.  Whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nADA, RA, and their respective implementing regulations by failing to \nprovide  reasonable  accommodations  such  as,  but  not  limited  to: \ncommunity-based mental and behavioral services and access to programs, \nprofessionals,  and/or  equipment  necessary  to  treat  or  accommodate \ndisabilities. \nAdequacy: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n23.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately safeguard the interests of the \nclasses they seek to represent. Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds that apply broadly \nto all class members, warranting class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs’ counsel is \nunaware of any conflicts among class members. The Named Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys \nwith extensive experience in class action litigation, child welfare litigation, and complex litigation. \n24.  Marcia Robinson Lowry, Robyn Goldberg, and Anastasia Benedetto are attorneys \nwith A Better Childhood, Inc., a non-profit legal organization, which has extensive experience and \nexpertise in federal child welfare class action litigation actions throughout the U.S. \n25.  Margaret Zwisler, William O’Reilly, and Julie Gorla are attorneys with the Barbara \nMcDowell Social Justice Center, and each has extensive experience and expertise in federal civil \nlitigation and class actions throughout the U.S. \n26.  Wesley R. Powell, Justin Garbacz, and Amanda M. Payne are attorneys with \nWillkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, a law firm whose attorneys are experienced in class action civil \nrights litigation. \n8 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 8 of 74 PageID #: 8\n\n \n27.  Eric Hecker, of Wang Hecker LLP, is an experienced civil rights litigator who has \nrepresented foster children in individual and class actions and has served as lead counsel in class \nactions arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n28.  Sarah B. Miller and Miranda MacNaughton are attorneys with Bass, Berry & Sims, \nPLC, a law firm that routinely handles class action and civil rights lawsuits. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A) and (B) \n29.  This action is maintainable as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1). The \nGeneral Class consists of approximately 9,000 members, and the ADA Subclass consists of \nthousands of members. Individual lawsuits would risk inconsistent and varying rulings, potentially \nleading  to  conflicting  standards  of  conduct  for  Defendants.  Moreover,  separate  actions  by \nindividual members could result in decisions that, in practice, would significantly hinder other \nmembers’ ability to protect their interests. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \n30.  This action is also maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \nbecause Defendants’ policies, practices, actions, and omissions that form the basis of this \ncomplaint are common to and apply generally to all members of the General Class and ADA \nSubclass, and the injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate and will apply to all \nmembers of the Class and Subclass. \nPARTIES \nI.  Named Plaintiffs \nKeira M. \n31.  Plaintiff Keira M. (age 11) has been in DCS custody since August 2024 and remains \nin DCS custody as of the time of this filing. While in DCS custody, DCS has subjected Keira to \n9 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 9 of 74 PageID #: 9\n\n \nunnecessary physical, mental, and emotional harm by failing to provide timely and appropriate \nmental health treatment, placing her in overly restrictive institutional settings, and obstructing her \npath to a permanent home. \n  \n32.  Keira appears in this action through her next friend, Stacie Odeneal. Stacie Odeneal \nis Keira’s guardian ad litem (“GAL”) and has been advocating in Keira’s best interest since Keira \ncame into DCS custody. She is very familiar with Keira’s history and is dedicated to Keira’s best \ninterests. \n33.  Keira  was  previously  adopted  out  of  DCS  custody  five  years  ago  following \nsignificant abuse and neglect by her biological parents, but went back into DCS custody in August \n2024.  \n34.  After Keira was hospitalized in August 2024, Vanderbilt Hospital staff warned that \nreturning her to her adoptive home would pose an imminent risk to her and the other children. In \nresponse, her adoptive parents followed medical advice and did not allow her to return home. \nRather than support the family through crisis services, DCS took custody of Keira, alleging \nabandonment, but failed to follow its Family Crisis Intervention Program guidelines or offer \nstabilization services to preserve the adoptive placement. \n35.  DCS  then  placed  Keira  in  a  transitional  placement  facility  from  August  to \nNovember 2024, during which time she received no therapy or services despite a well-documented \nhistory of mental health needs. Although transitional placements are intended to be short-term \nwhile  assessments  are  completed,  DCS  neither  completed  timely  assessments  nor  initiated \nappropriate services for Keira. \n10 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 10 of 74 PageID #: 10\n\n \n36.  In  November  2024,  DCS  placed  Keira  in  a  Level  4  (the  most  restrictive) \ninstitutional facility where she remains to this day. Despite repeated requests by Keira’s GAL, \nDCS has provided no documentation to justify why this highest-level, most restrictive setting is \nappropriate for Keira, or that less restrictive alternatives were considered. \n37.  Keira has a prospective foster family ready and willing to care for her, and they \nhave completed all licensing requirements, including a home study. However, DCS has delayed \napproval of the placement by failing to review the final home study, which has been pending with \nDCS’s Office of Network Development. The prospective foster mother has a flexible weekday \nschedule which would allow her to visit Keira regularly, but the facility allows visitation only on \nSaturdays, impeding bonding. DCS has failed to intervene, despite knowing that these restrictions \nare preventing Keira from developing a relationship that could support her transition to family-\nbased care. \n38.  Reports from the facility regarding Keira’s progress are contradictory. Verbal \nupdates  are  consistently  positive,  and  Keira  has  been  allowed  to  participate  in  high-level \nprogramming typically reserved for children nearing discharge. However, written reports—all \nauthored by a single therapist—assert that Keira is not progressing and should be stripped of \nprivileges. DCS has taken no action to investigate these discrepancies or assess Keira’s actual level \nof progress. \n39.  In November 2024, Keira was denied her right to attend a Foster Care Review \nBoard (“FCRB”) meeting. The facility falsely reported that she was unavailable, although she was \npresent on campus and could have participated via video with minimal accommodation. DCS did \nnot act to protect her right to participate in these critical permanency planning discussions. \n11 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 11 of 74 PageID #: 11\n\n \n40.  In March 2025, after months of receiving no records regarding Keira’s diagnoses \nor treatment plan, her GAL sent a letter threatening to subpoena her medical records. Within an \nhour, the facility moved Keira to discharge status and requested a discharge planning meeting. \nHowever, because DCS had not approved the pending foster home, Keira faces the possibility of \nbeing placed in an unknown temporary setting instead of with the family ready to receive her, \nfurther destabilizing a child whose mental health issues are worsened by instability. \n41.  As a direct result of DCS’s actions and omissions, Keira has suffered and continues \nto suffer psychological and emotional harm. DCS housed her for months in temporary settings due \nto a lack of adequate placements, then transferred her to a harsh, overly restrictive facility without \ndocumentation of need. DCS has ignored credible warnings about the harm of this placement and \nfailed to pursue a less restrictive, supportive home that is available and ready. As a result, Keira \nremains without proper mental health treatment, without a path to permanency, and without the \nstability that would allow her to heal and thrive. \nDarnell H. \n42.  Darnell H. (age 15) entered DCS custody in April 2018. He remains in DCS custody \nat the time of this filing. In the seven years since entering foster care, DCS has subjected Darnell \nto unnecessary and prolonged institutionalization, deprived him of educational and therapeutic \nservices, and failed to act on multiple opportunities to secure him a safe, stable, and supportive \nhome. \n43.  Darnell appears in this action through his next friend, Sherry Taylor. Sherry Taylor \nserved as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (“CASA”); in this role, she regularly visited with \nDarnell in residential placement and assisted in advocating on his behalf in Child and Family Team \n12 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 12 of 74 PageID #: 12\n\n \nmeetings (“CFTMs”) and court hearings. She is very familiar with Darnell’s history and is \ndedicated to his best interests. \n44.  Darnell was taken into custody at eight years of age, after Darnell’s mother struck \nhim in the face, causing him to bleed, and abandoned him on the side of the road. Darnell found a \nfirehouse, where he was treated by emergency medical technicians (“EMTs”). The EMTs took \nDarnell to the hospital for treatment. The hospital then contacted DCS, and Darnell was taken into \ntheir custody. \n45.  Over the past seven years, DCS has bounced Darnell between at least 14 separate \nplacements. DCS has kept Darnell unnecessarily in institutional placements for over 90% of this \ntime. This repeated institutionalization has harmed Darnell, retraumatizing him and exacerbating \nhis mental health conditions.  \n46.  Adoption was added as a permanency goal for Darnell in April 2019, yet he still \nremains in DCS custody.  \n47.  In November 2020, DCS’s Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (“CANS”) \nassessment of Darnell indicated the appropriate placement for Darnell was a Level 2 (therapeutic) \nfoster home; nevertheless, DCS has continually kept Darnell in more restrictive Level 3 and 4 \nresidential facilities, with the exception of a four-month placement in a pre-adoptive home in 2023. \n48.  A psychiatric evaluation from the summer of 2023 found that residential facility \nsettings continuously retraumatized Darnell and were detrimental to his mental health; the loud \nnoises, fighting, and use of restraints triggered Darnell due to his prior physical abuse. Despite \nthis, DCS has continued to house Darnell in residential facilities to the present day. \n49.  Darnell has not received adequate educational support while in DCS custody. \nAlthough Darnell has been housed primarily in residential facilities for the past five years, neither \n13 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 13 of 74 PageID #: 13\n\n \nDCS nor their contracted facilities have advocated for an accurate Individualized Education Plan \n(“IEP”) from his school, nor ensured that he was offered appropriate educational services. In 2023, \nwhen Darnell was 13 years old, he was assessed as performing at a second grade level. No remedial \nservices are listed in his IEP as to appropriate educational services to help him catch up to his \ngrade level in the required subject areas.  \n50.  When Darnell was in his first foster home in 2019, he had no IEP and was struggling \nboth in the home and at school. He was housed with two of his younger siblings in the same \nhome. Due to the lack of appropriate testing and IEP, the foster mother remained ignorant of \nDarnell’s needs and held him to a standard that he was unable to meet. His GAL repeatedly \nrequested that DCS provide educational support for Darnell and pursue an IEP for him, but DCS \nrefused. \n51.  Darnell’s placement with his siblings in the 2019 foster home disrupted in early \n2020 and Darnell was separated from his siblings, who have since been adopted by that foster \nmother. Except for a brief stay in a pre-adoptive home in 2023, Darnell has been housed in Level \n3 or 4 residential settings ever since. \n52.  The GAL was finally able to obtain an initial IEP for Darnell in September 2021. \nHowever,  the  IEP  contained  contradictory  information  –  his  assessed  reading  and  math \nproficiency was at the 1% level, despite “teacher observation” from the residential placement \nschool stating that he was capable of 70% achievement in both subject areas. The GAL requested \nadditional testing for possible learning disabilities, but DCS never arranged for the testing. When \nshe withdrew as his GAL in early 2021, DCS and Darnell’s residential placement promised to \narrange for testing and have his school update his IEP accordingly, but this never occurred. \n14 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 14 of 74 PageID #: 14\n\n \n53.  Shortly after the 2023 psychological assessment, DCS placed Darnell in a pre-\nadoptive home where he stayed for only four months. Prior to transferring him to this pre-adoptive \nhome, DCS failed to have his school update the IEP with the information from the assessment. \nDCS also failed to inform the foster parents of Darnell’s behavioral and academic needs and falsely \ntold them he was receiving all “A’s.” Darnell was placed in a traditional classroom for his grade, \nbut he was unable to perform the work because of the lack of necessary services. As a result, he \nstruggled with behavioral issues at the school and after just four months, the pre-adoptive parents \nrequested Darnell’s removal, citing a lack of information and support from DCS. \n54.  After removing Darnell from the pre-adoptive foster home, DCS again bounced \nDarnell around, this time to a Level 4 placement, then to short-term and respite placements, and \nfinally returned him to a Level 3 residential facility in May 2024, where he remains. \n55.  Neither the residential facility nor DCS have provided Darnell with consistent \naccess to hygiene products or clothing. During his first stay at this facility, his GAL offered to buy \nhim a Christmas present and asked what he wanted. The only thing Darnell wanted was his “own \ndeodorant stick.” \n56.  Over the past year, Darnell’s former GAL has provided him with body wash, \ndeodorant, moisturizer, and clothing because DCS and the facility failed to meet his basic needs. \n57.   Just two months after Darnell arrived at the Level 3 facility, he was assessed as \nsuitable to step down in care. One year later, he remains at the same facility. \n58.  In February 2025, Darnell’s contract caseworker reported to the FCRB that Darnell \nwas ready to step down to a lower level of care. At that same meeting, Darnell told the FCRB that \nhe did not feel safe at the residential facility. The FCRB called DCS into the meeting to discuss \nthe issue; DCS failed to take any action.  \n15 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 15 of 74 PageID #: 15\n\n \n59.  Darnell has since reiterated to both DCS and the juvenile court that he feels unsafe \nat the facility, yet DCS continues to keep him there, claiming it has nowhere else to place him.  \n60.  DCS has also failed to hold timely permanency meetings for Darnell. Although \nquarterly meetings are required, DCS has not held one in nearly a year. A CFTM scheduled for \nApril 2025 was canceled twice and has still not occurred. \n61.  Darnell’s former GAL is ready and willing to foster Darnell and possibly adopt \nhim. The GAL has known Darnell since 2018, has knowledge of his specific needs, and is eager \nto provide him with the necessary support. When the GAL began the process to be certified as a \nfoster/pre-adoptive home, she reached out to DCS to request group counseling with Darnell to \nprepare for the possible transition. DCS never responded to her email. The former GAL has also \nrepeatedly requested in-person visits and home passes for Darnell, but DCS has not responded to \nthose requests either. The GAL has completed all training, and the only remaining steps are in \nDCS’s hands. If DCS were to act promptly, she could be certified as a foster parent within two \nweeks. She has repeatedly informed DCS that she is pursuing foster parent certification solely to \nfoster Darnell. \n62.  The former GAL has again requested more testing and updates to Darnell’s IEP, \nbut DCS has failed to pursue either.  \n63.  Instead of pursuing placement with the GAL, DCS has continued to post that \nDarnell is available for adoption on its public website, ignoring a viable, willing caregiver. \n64.  As a direct result of DCS’s actions and failures to act, Darnell has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer profound harm. DCS unnecessarily segregated and continues to segregate \nDarnell in an institution. Further, DCS has ignored professional recommendations, failed to act on \nDarnell’s repeated pleas for safety, and obstructed a potential placement with a qualified and \n16 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 16 of 74 PageID #: 16\n\n \ndedicated caregiver. DCS’s continued failures harm Darnell by denying him the stable, nurturing \nhome he deserves and to which he is entitled, and by denying him the services he needs to succeed. \nJasmine G. \n65.  Plaintiff Jasmine G. (age 15) entered DCS custody at age 12 and remains in DCS \ncustody as of the date of this filing. DCS has subjected Jasmine to unnecessary physical, mental, \nand emotional harm by placing her in inappropriate institutional settings, failing to provide \nessential mental health care, and failing to ensure her basic needs are met. \n66.  Jasmine appears in this action through her next friend, Stacie Odeneal. Stacie \nOdeneal is Jasmine’s GAL and has been advocating in her best interest for years. She is very \nfamiliar with Jasmine’s history and is dedicated to her best interests. \n67.  DCS initially placed Jasmine, a child who had been trafficked by her biological \nmother, in a foster home with her sister, but failed to provide the intensive therapy necessary to \naddress her severe trauma. In September 2023, DCS sent Jasmine to an out-of-state residential \nfacility over 1,500 miles away due to the lack of appropriate in-state placements. The facility’s \nprogram  was  designed  as  a  six-month  residential  program,  but  Jasmine  has  now  been \ninstitutionalized there for over 18 months with no clear plan for transition. \n68.  The facility itself has repeatedly requested Jasmine’s removal, citing its inability to \nmeet her treatment needs, including a lack of specialized “attachment therapy” critical to her \nrecovery. Despite her GAL’s repeated requests, DCS has refused to move Jasmine to a more \nsuitable placement. Jasmine’s GAL again raised this issue at Jasmine’s permanency hearing in \nMarch 2025. \n69.  Jasmine is prescribed psychiatric medications that are ineffective and have harmful \nside effects. Despite this, she has not received regular follow-up from medical staff, and her \n17 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 17 of 74 PageID #: 17\n\n \nmedications have not been adjusted in over 18 months. DCS has failed to follow its own procedures \nrequiring regular assessment of treatment goals and symptom response. \n70.  Jasmine has not received consistent visits from an assigned caseworker during her \n18-month placement. Instead, DCS has sent various unassigned caseworkers with no relationship \nto Jasmine. The most recent Affidavit of Reasonable Efforts (a sworn statement documenting \nDCS’s efforts to reunify the family) from March 19, 2025 confirms that Jasmine had not been \nvisited by her assigned caseworker for 10 months, with only two face-to-face visits during that 12-\nmonth period, neither by her assigned caseworker. Over this period, Jasmine has been reassigned \nto four different caseworkers, each unfamiliar with her case. \n71.  In December 2024, Jasmine’s facility again requested her removal following an \nincident. Jasmine packed all of her belongings in a garbage bag in anticipation, but DCS failed to \nretrieve her. A facility employee later threw away the bag containing all of Jasmine’s clothing. \nNeither the facility nor DCS replaced the clothing, with the exception of random items from a “lost \nand found.” \n72.  When Jasmine’s GAL recommended using Jasmine’s allowance to purchase new \nclothing, the facility stated Jasmine had no allowance, despite a state mandate of $2/day for all \nfoster children in residential care. DCS took no action, even after the GAL escalated the issue to \nDCS’s lead counsel in February 2025. DCS eventually issued a $250 clothing voucher in April \n2025—over two months later. \n73.  Because she lacked appropriate clothing, Jasmine was unable to participate in \nequine therapy, a required component for program completion. Her GAL notified DCS of this \nbarrier, but DCS took no timely corrective action. \n18 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 18 of 74 PageID #: 18\n\n \n74.  Although Jasmine is almost 16 years old and has a right to attend CFTMs to \nparticipate in planning her future, DCS has conducted at least 17 meetings without Jasmine \npresent. Jasmine reported to her GAL that she wants to attend CFTMs, but the facility has \nprevented her from doing so. DCS has never intervened to ensure that Jasmine attends these \nCFTMs. Prior to the most recent CFTM in February 2025, Jasmine’s GAL emailed the facility to \ninsist on Jasmine’s presence. Despite this email, the facility did not bring Jasmine to the meeting \nuntil the GAL refused to let the meeting commence in Jasmine’s absence. This is the first and only \ntime Jasmine has been able to attend a CFTM. \n75.  There is a family who wants to adopt Jasmine, but DCS has failed to take steps to \nimplement a plan for her transition to their home. Due to Jasmine’s untreated attachment issues, \nshe is afraid to be adopted by this family because she believes that if she opens herself to a \nrelationship with someone, that person will eventually turn on her and abandon her. Attachment \ntherapy is a form of psychotherapy specifically designed to help those with traumatic histories \ndevelop healthy relationships. Had DCS provided attachment therapy to Jasmine, it is likely that \nshe would have been able to join this family that wants her and experience a stable, supportive \nfamily and community where she could thrive. \n76.  As a direct result of DCS’s failures, Jasmine has suffered and continues to suffer \nphysical, mental, and emotional harm. She has been warehoused in an inappropriate institutional \nfacility without necessary therapeutic services or basic support. DCS continues to harm Jasmine \nby failing to act on well-documented deficiencies, neglecting to provide critical services, and \ndenying her the permanency and stability she could achieve in a home with a family ready to \nwelcome her.  \n \n19 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 19 of 74 PageID #: 19\n\n \nAmara and Zane G. \n77.  Plaintiffs Amara G. (age 9) and Zane G. (age 8) are siblings who have been in DCS \ncustody since 2017 and remain in DCS custody as of the date of this filing. DCS has subjected \nboth children to unnecessary emotional, psychological, and behavioral harm by failing to provide \nsafe and stable placements, depriving them of timely and consistent therapeutic services, and \ndenying them a path to permanency and ongoing sibling contact. \n78.  Amara and Zane appear in this action through their next friend, Darlene Vastano. \nDarlene Vastano is and has been the CASA for Amara and Zane G. since 2017. In that role, she \nhas known Amara and Zane G. and has been advocating in their best interest for approximately \neight years. She is very familiar with Amara and Zane’s history and is dedicated to their best \ninterests.  \n79.  Amara and Zane entered foster care at ages two and one, respectively, after being \nremoved from their biological mother’s care due to neglect. Their mother was regularly using \ndrugs  and  would  leave  the  children  for  long  periods  of  time,  including  during  periods  of \nincarceration. The children were ultimately removed after Amara was physically abused in the \nhome by a third party. DCS concluded that the mother failed to adequately supervise the children \nand thereby enabled the abuse. \n80.  DCS initially placed the children with an older, licensed foster parent who was \nknown to them. That placement lasted about a year, but the foster parent ultimately decided she \nwas not prepared to adopt. The children were then placed in a pre-adoptive foster home, which \ndisrupted after the foster parents separated. After removal, DCS learned that the children had been \nabused in the home. Although DCS conducted an internal investigation, it never disclosed the \nresults. While in that same home, Amara was also sexually abused at daycare. \n20 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 20 of 74 PageID #: 20\n\n \n81.  Around the end of 2022, the court terminated the biological mother’s parental \nrights. At the same time, Amara’s and Zane’s placement disrupted, and both children began \ndisplaying  significant  behavioral  challenges.  Amara  became  physically  aggressive  and \ndysregulated.  Zane,  who  has  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (“PTSD”)  and  symptoms  of \noppositional defiant disorder, began acting out aggressively and was hospitalized multiple times \nfor self-harm by age six. He also engaged in defiant behaviors, such as intentional soiling. DCS \nassessed Zane as needing a Level 3 foster home, while Amara required a lower level of care. DCS \nseparated the siblings, placing Amara back with the initial foster parent, who refused to take Zane. \n82.  Both children have experienced chronic delays and gaps in therapeutic care. Zane \nfrequently went without therapy due to placement instability. Amara went without therapy for six \nmonths to a year because her school failed to provide it; DCS did not provide it either. During \ntransitions, neither child received continuity of services, and weeks or months often passed without \ncare. Although sibling therapy was recommended, DCS never arranged it. \n83.  From March to October 2023, Zane had no long-term placement. Though DCS \nclaimed it was seeking a Level 3 home for him, Zane was instead cycled through night-to-night \nfoster arrangements. During the day, he was sent to a temporary holding facility that grouped \nchildren of different ages together. Seven-year-old Zane was placed with teenagers, leading to \nfurther deterioration in his mental health and behavior. \n84.  This unstable setup deprived Zane of any consistent caregiver, exposed him to \ninappropriate peer interactions, and left him isolated from his sister and any semblance of routine. \nThe instability significantly escalated his behavioral challenges. During this period, Zane received \nno therapy, and DCS failed to initiate new services in any of his placements. \n21 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 21 of 74 PageID #: 21\n\n \n85.  Although DCS stated that it was seeking a Level 3 placement for Zane, he never \nreceived one. In August 2023, he was briefly placed in a short-term setting before returning to \nnight-to-night care. For over a year, DCS placed Amara and Zane G. in separate, non-adoptive \nfoster homes. DCS placed Zane in a Level 1 foster home with a provider who was pressured to \naccept him despite being unlicensed for Level 3 care. The foster parent received little support from \nDCS and was not provided with needed respite care. \n86.  In March 2025, Amara and Zane were placed together in a pre-adoptive home, but \nthis placement only lasted approximately two weeks. After their brief placement together, Zane \nwas hospitalized and then discharged without a permanent placement. During the transition, there \nwere no services in place, and Zane received no education for several weeks. \n87.  Amara remains at the pre-adoptive home only until the end of the school year. \nAlthough the end of the school year is only a few weeks away, DCS does not have a placement \nplan for her either. \n88.  With the exception of two weeks in March 2025, Amara and Zane have now lived \napart for two years. Although DCS is required to facilitate sibling visits, none of the seven \ncaseworkers assigned to their case over the last eight years have arranged them. Their former foster \nparents from 2024 took it upon themselves to maintain the children’s sibling bond, but even that \nhas now been disrupted. \n89.  Despite court approval for a joint placement, Amara and Zane remain separated and \nhave no permanency plan. A standing court order requires DCS to demonstrate ongoing efforts to \nfind Zane a suitable placement, but progress has stalled. \n90.  As a direct result of DCS’s failures, including inappropriate placements, lack of \ntherapy, denial of sibling contact, and failure to achieve permanency, Amara and Zane have \n22 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 22 of 74 PageID #: 22\n\n \nsuffered and continue to suffer significant emotional and behavioral harm. DCS’s inaction has \ndeepened their trauma, left their needs unmet, and denied them the security and stability that foster \ncare is meant to provide. \nAaron C., Arielle H., Ava C., Andrew C., and Adrian H. \n91.  Plaintiffs Aaron C. (age 9), Arielle H. (age 6), Ava C. (age 4), Andrew C. (age 2), \nand Adrian H. (age 1) (collectively, the “C/H Siblings”) have been in DCS custody since December \n2022 and remain in DCS custody as of the date of this filing. DCS has subjected the C/H Siblings \nto unnecessary physical, mental, and emotional harm by failing to provide required documentation, \nhealth coverage, therapy, and case management services—resulting in prolonged delays to medical \nand behavioral treatment and long-term developmental harm. \n92.  Aaron, Arielle, Ava, Andrew, and Adrian appear in this action through their next \nfriend, Trina Rogers. Trina Rogers is a friend of the kinship foster family where the children have \nresided for over two years. She is familiar with the C/H Siblings’ history and is dedicated to their \nbest interests. \n93.  The C/H Siblings came into DCS custody after a family member reported their \nabuse and neglect, including sexual abuse by their biological grandparents. DCS placed the C/H \nsiblings in a kinship foster placement with that family member in December 2022. Adrian H. was \nborn after the removal of his siblings and was placed with the same foster mother as a newborn.  \n94.  When DCS brought Adrian H. to the family member, they did not inform her of the \nbaby’s condition. Adrian has a hole in his heart, did not (and still does not) eat by mouth, is \ndependent on a feeding tube, and has needed multiple surgeries. \n95.  From December 2022 to March 2023, DCS placed the C/H Siblings with their \nfamily member but did not provide her with an official placement. During this period, she was not \n23 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 23 of 74 PageID #: 23\n\n \ngiven medical insurance for the children and did not have authority to seek medical care on their \nbehalf. Acting on her own initiative, she obtained medical cards from the children’s biological \nparents. When several of the children developed ear infections and Andrew suffered an asthma \nattack, she had to call numerous doctors before finding one who would treat the children. \n96.  Even after DCS formally placed the C/H Siblings with their family member/now-\nfoster mother in March 2023, DCS continued to fail to provide critical documents, including the \nchildren’s birth certificates, social security cards, and medical insurance coverage. Despite their \nfoster mother’s repeated written requests to DCS officials, Ava’s and Andrew’s insurance lapsed \nin November 2023. DCS did not inform their foster mother of the lapse; she only discovered it \nwhen Andrew needed urgent care for an ear infection. TennCare coverage was not restored until \nAugust 2024—nearly nine months later—because DCS had failed to obtain the birth certificates \nrequired for the application. \n97.  These delays in insurance coverage caused significant disruptions to necessary \ncare.  Ava  could  not  attend  specialty  optometrist  appointments  and  was  unable  to  receive \noccupational therapy or dental care until TennCare was restored. Andrew missed occupational \ntherapy, speech therapy, hearing tests, and dental appointments. As a result of the lack of insurance, \nboth children’s learning was delayed, and they were only diagnosed with autism in January 2024. \n98.  Despite the children’s extensive trauma and need for therapeutic services, DCS \nfailed to arrange therapy. Their foster mother independently located a therapist for the children \nand paid out-of-pocket for their care because the therapist did not accept TennCare. DCS assured \nher it would cover the therapist’s fees and also locate a provider within network—but it has done \nneither.  The  children  are  not  receiving  therapy  at  the  frequency  prescribed  by  medical \nprofessionals, as their foster mother cannot afford the ongoing costs. \n24 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 24 of 74 PageID #: 24\n\n \n99.  Their foster mother discovered that Aaron was eligible to receive school counseling \nfrom an outside provider; however, DCS failed to complete the paperwork for months. Per policy, \nonly DCS could complete the paperwork, so Aaron’s counseling was consequently delayed. \n100.  DCS also delayed the C/H Siblings’ enrollment in the Strong Families program, \nwhich provides grants for children with special needs. Their foster mother discovered the program \non her own, but initial delays due to lack of insurance, and later, due to DCS’s failure to complete \nthe application paperwork, resulted in months of lost time. Though their foster mother provided \nthe required forms and contact information to the caseworker, he failed to complete them. The C/H \nSiblings ultimately received the grants only after a four-month delay caused by DCS’s inaction. \n101.  Since entering care in December 2022, the C/H Siblings have had four or five \ndifferent caseworkers. Many caseworker visits have been perfunctory; caseworkers failed to \nexamine the condition of their foster home, did not speak to the children privately, and often were \nunfamiliar with the children or their case. Most visits were conducted by substitute caseworkers, \nrather than the assigned caseworker. Throughout these visits, their foster mother repeatedly \nrequested assistance in obtaining necessary documentation and health insurance, to no avail. \n102.  DCS also failed to hold required CFTMs for the C/H Siblings. CFTMs were only \nheld after the foster mother insisted on them, and DCS often allowed over seven months to lapse \nbetween meetings. \n103.  As a result of DCS’s ongoing failure to provide essential documentation, case \nplanning, health care, and services, the C/H Siblings have suffered and continue to suffer physical, \nmental, and developmental harm. Delays in diagnosis and treatment have led to worsened medical \nconditions, including more invasive treatment than would have otherwise been necessary. DCS’s \nongoing refusal to provide therapy at the required frequency further harms the children’s well-\n25 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 25 of 74 PageID #: 25\n\n \nbeing, leaving them without the support necessary to address their trauma and developmental \nneeds. \nZander M. \n104. Plaintiff Zander M. (age 15) has been in DCS custody since February 2015 and \nremains in DCS custody as of the date of this filing. DCS has subjected Zander to unnecessary \nphysical, mental, and emotional harm by placing him in unsafe and temporary placements where \nhe has been inappropriately restrained using unauthorized methods.  \n105. Zander appears in this action through his next friend, Marjorie Bristol. Marjorie \nBristol—a Tennessee attorney who has spent nearly three decades advocating for vulnerable \npopulations—practiced for four years as a GAL in foster cases, and spent over six years as lead \neducation attorney for DCS. Since 2017, she has maintained her own child-focused legal \npractice. Marjorie Bristol has acquainted herself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding \nZander’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his best interest. \n106. DCS placed Zander at Cumberland Primary Assessment Center (an assessment \nfacility on the Clover Bottom campus) for almost two months, from February 21, 2025 to April \n15, 2025.  \n107.  Though Clover Bottom solely houses children who have allegedly suffered parental \nabuse and/or neglect, the assessment facility is enclosed with razor-wire, and DCS permits staff to \nphysically restrain children. Zander was physically manhandled twice over two months for \nwalking towards a door which led to the razor-wire-enclosed yard.  \n108.  On the first occasion, a male staff member forced Zander to a nearby couch. Once \nZander was lying on the couch, the male staff member climbed on top of him and pinned Zander \ndown with his body.  \n26 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 26 of 74 PageID #: 26\n\n \n109.  The second time, the male staff member restraining Zander came exceedingly close \nto Zander’s genitals. Zander, who has a history of witnessing physical abuse between his parents, \nwas traumatized by this contact. Despite the seriousness of the allegation, DCS took no known \naction to investigate the conduct or ensure his safety. DCS failed to respond to Zander’s attorneys’ \nrequests for the incident reports; DCS also failed to respond to the grievances that Zander filed \nabout these two incidents. \n110.  Throughout his entire stay at Clover Bottom, DCS provided Zander with inedible \nfood served at unsafe temperatures. All food was cold, regardless of whether the food was \nsupposed to be warm. This, combined with the treatment by staff, harmed Zander to the point that \nhe was unable to defecate for weeks at a time. He filed daily grievances regarding the conditions \nand treatment at the facility, but again, he received no response. DCS also failed to respond to his \nattorneys’ requests for copies of the grievances.  \n111.  During his stay at Clover Bottom, Zander, who has an IQ in the low-to-mid 70s, \nreported that his prescribed medications were causing him troublesome side effects. Although \nZander has voiced his complaints, he continues to be given these medications. DCS has taken no \naction to explore this issue or work with medical professionals to adjust Zander’s medications. \nInstead, DCS workers inaccurately claim that he refuses to take the medications. \n112.  DCS attempted to unnecessarily institutionalize Zander, based on their incorrect \nreports and their simultaneous failure to address Zander’s medical needs. At a recent meeting to \ndiscuss Zander’s long-term placement, DCS recommended a Level 3 (i.e., residential facility) \nplacement due to Zander’s supposed medical ‘non-compliance.’ Zander’s GAL was unable to \nrefute DCS’s inaccurate reports because DCS excluded her from the meeting after she asked to \nreschedule due to a conflict. \n27 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 27 of 74 PageID #: 27\n\n \n113.  Zander requires special education services due to his intellectual disabilities and his \nmental health diagnoses. While at Clover Bottom, DCS’s version of ‘school’ consisted solely of \ndispensing second-grade level worksheets to Zander, an approach that not only failed to meet his \ncognitive and academic needs, but also demeaned him and worsened his mental health.  \n114.  While DCS pursued an inappropriate and harmful institutional placement, they \nignored a viable and appropriate foster home placement that was interested in providing a \nplacement for Zander. When Zander’s GAL provided DCS with the name of a family friend who \nwanted to foster Zander, DCS sat on this information for almost a full month before looking into \nthis possibility. Eventually, DCS approved the family friend, and Zander was placed with the \nfamily friend on April 15, 2025, but only after an unnecessarily lengthy and traumatic stay at \nClover Bottom. \n115.  As of the date of this filing, Zander remains in DCS custody. His current placement \nis with the family friend, but DCS has failed to implement any of the recommendations in Zander’s \npermanency plan. DCS has ignored requests for assistance in updating Zander’s IEP, has ignored \nrequests to begin services with Zander’s mother so that the family can be safely reunified, and \nignores his attorneys’ requests for documentation as to these steps. As a result, Zander is not getting \nthe services he needs, nor does he know where he will ultimately live. DCS’s failure to investigate \nserious abuse allegations, to follow up on appropriate placements, and to provide necessary \neducational and mental health services has left Zander vulnerable, retraumatized, and without the \nsupport he needs to recover and succeed. \nDewayne W. \n116.  Plaintiff Dewayne W. (age 15) has been in DCS custody since April 2022 after \ncoming into care through a Neglect and Dependency petition. He remains in DCS custody as of \n28 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 28 of 74 PageID #: 28\n\n \nthe date of this filing. In three years, DCS has sent Dewayne to at least seven placements, including \nmultiple stays in temporary placement centers. DCS has subjected Dewayne to unnecessary \nphysical, mental, and emotional harm by placing him in facilities with unsafe living conditions, \ninappropriately housing him in lockdown facilities, and depriving him of his right to an adequate \neducation.  \n117.  Dewayne appears in this action through his next friend, Emily Jenkins. Emily \nJenkins is an adoptive parent and was a CASA in Tennessee for almost ten years. She has also \nbeen a CASA board member and is a state-certified trainer in the Building Strong Brains program, \nwhich examines the impact of Adverse Child Experiences (“ACES”). Having spent nearly a \ndecade advocating for foster children, Emily Jenkins is very familiar with Tennessee’s foster care \nsystem. Emily Jenkins has acquainted herself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding \nDewayne’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his best interests. \n118.  DCS policies advocate working toward reunification with biological parents where \nappropriate.  However,  DCS  refused  to  provide  Dewayne’s  mother  with  adequate  planning, \nservices, or support to enable reunification of the family for over two years. Instead, DCS claimed \nthat his mother had failed to meet her obligations needed to work towards reunification and \nshuffled Dewayne from placement to placement. Finally, Dewayne’s GAL intervened and ensured \nDewayne’s mother was appointed counsel. Only then did she begin to receive the clarity and \nservices she needed. During this period, DCS’s permanency plan for Dewayne was bare-bones and \nincomplete—it lacked drug assessments for his mother and did not detail the required family \ncounseling or housing goals necessary to reunify the family. \n29 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 29 of 74 PageID #: 29\n\n \n119.  Though DCS states that transitional and assessment placements are short-term \nplacements for children awaiting a foster placement, DCS warehoused Dewayne in these facilities \nfor almost three months, from January 30, 2025 to April 25, 2025. \n120.  For  the  first  month  of  Dewayne’s  stay  in  transitional  housing,  DCS  did  not \ndocument his location. DCS listed Dewayne as a “runaway” for the entire month of February, \ndespite the fact that he was in their custody and physically present at transitional housing during \nthat time. \n121.  Dewayne  spent  the  majority  of  this  time  at  Resource  Linkage,  a  transitional \nplacement on the former Tennessee Preparatory School campus (“TPS”). TPS, which functioned \nessentially as an orphanage, was shut down under Brian A., in part due to environmental concerns, \nsuch as the non-potable water in the faucets (signs throughout the building warned people not to \ndrink the water). DCS re-opened this campus as transitional housing without addressing the safety \nissues that caused its closure. During Dewayne’s entire time there, he noted that the water was \nstrange and, for example, did not get him clean while bathing. \n122.   Dewayne lived in Resource Linkage in February 2025. During that time, DCS \nfailed to arrange for Dewayne’s attendance at an alternative school after he was wrongfully \nexpelled on January 30, nor did they re-enroll him after the wrongful expulsion was overturned on \nFebruary 24, 2025. Instead, DCS sent his mother to try to register him, even though she did not \nhave custody and was therefore not legally permitted to do so. When Dewayne’s attorney \nintervened, DCS still refused to take responsibility. As a result, Dewayne missed school entirely \nfrom January 30 through March 17, 2025, including the school-based speech therapy and basic \nreading interventions required by his IEP. He reports losing much of his vocabulary during this \ntime.  \n30 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 30 of 74 PageID #: 30\n\n \n123.  After the expulsion was overturned, DCS still did not re-enroll Dewayne in school, \nand instead moved him, without notice or explanation, to an assessment center on the Clover \nBottom campus. He was the only child from his transitional housing facility transferred there. \nWhile at the assessment center, Dewayne had no access to his personal clothing, which DCS had \nleft at the previous placement.  \n124.  At the Clover Bottom assessment center, DCS’s sole method of education relied \nexclusively on worksheets for instruction. Dewayne did not receive any of the services mandated \nby his IEP. \n125.  Since returning to the transitional placement on the Resource Linkage campus, \nDCS  has  consistently  interfered  with  Dewayne’s  education.  DCS,  which  is  responsible  for \ntransporting Dewayne to school, regularly drops him off extremely late. Because the driver \nchanges daily, there is no consistent routine, and Dewayne arrives late every day—causing him to \nmiss English, one of the very subjects tied to his IEP. He is now at risk of in-school suspension for \nexcessive tardiness, despite the fact that the delays are entirely outside of his control. Dewayne’s \nsocial worker was supposed to email the attendance clerks daily to explain the reason for his \ntardiness, but this has not occurred. Dewayne remains at risk of falling further behind, and DCS \nhas offered no plan to remediate the harm caused by weeks of missed education or to ensure that \nhis specialized services resume.  \n126.  As a direct result of DCS’s failures, Dewayne has suffered and continues to suffer \nharm. DCS has kept Dewayne in unsafe, unsanitary and unhealthy placements, continually \nretraumatized him with unnecessarily harsh placements, and forced him to languish in foster care \nfor years instead of providing the services appropriate to reunification. Though Dewayne longs to \nreunite with his mother for a trial home visit, Dewayne and his mother only receive supervised \n31 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 31 of 74 PageID #: 31\n\n \nvisitation due to DCS’s failures to provide the necessary services to them over the past several \nyears. Further, DCS has failed to provide Dewayne with the mental health services and educational \nservices necessary to his safety and well-being.  \nMax W. \n127.  Max W. (age 16) entered DCS custody in April 2024 and remains in DCS custody \nas of the date of this filing. In the one year since entering care, DCS has subjected Max to \nunnecessary physical, mental, and emotional harm by repeatedly placing him in unstable and \ninappropriate placements, denying him access to education, and failing to provide necessary \ntherapeutic and disability-related support. \n128.  Max appears in this action through his next friend, Sherry Taylor. While on staff at \nCASA, Sherry Taylor was the Team Lead for the volunteer assigned to Max; in that role, Ms. \nTaylor visited Max regularly and advocated on his behalf in CFTMs and court hearings. She is \nvery familiar with Max’s history and is dedicated to his best interests.  \n129.  Max came into DCS custody because he was spending most of his life in the streets \ndue to neglect by his grandmother. \n130.  In the past year, Max has been in five placements. \n131.  DCS first placed Max at Resource Linkage, a transitional placement, apparently \ndue to a lack of appropriate foster homes suited to his needs, where DCS kept him for two months \nbefore sending him to a residential facility. \n132.  In June and July 2024, the facility’s on-site teacher verbally abused Max for his \nintellectual disabilities. On one occasion, the teacher mocked Max to his face as being “slow.”  \n32 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 32 of 74 PageID #: 32\n\n \n133.  After the verbally abusive teacher left the facility in July 2024, the facility did not \nhave any teachers for several weeks, nor did they provide any alternative education. Max did not \nreceive any education during this time.  \n134.   In Max’s discharge planning from the residential facility, DCS determined that \nMax required a therapeutic foster home, where he would be the only child. \n135.  Despite the recommendation, in December 2024, DCS placed Max in a non-\ntherapeutic foster home with caregivers who lacked any relevant training. Just three days after \nplacement, DCS violated its own recommendation by placing another child in the home and \nrotating additional children in and out for short “respite” stays, undermining the stability and \nsupport Max required. \n136.  The foster parents, overwhelmed and unprepared, requested Max’s removal within \ntwo months. In February 2025, DCS sent Max back to transitional placement at Resource Linkage. \nWhile there, DCS failed to enroll him in school, denying him access to education for the duration \nof his stay. \n137.  In addition to Max’s intellectual disabilities, he also suffers from depression and \nsuicidal ideation. In June 2024, Max was suicidal and required intervention; his attorney asked his \nDCS social worker to take him to the hospital for treatment, but the social worker replied that it \nwas “not her job.”  \n138.  In March 2025, DCS next moved Max to a Disability and Intellectual Disability \nSupport (“DIDS”) residential facility. While there, staff called the police on Max for taking the \ngroup landline telephone into his room. Despite Max’s disabilities, staff subjected him to police \ninterrogation and pressured him to “confess.” When Max asked to remain silent, staff had him \n33 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 33 of 74 PageID #: 33\n\n \narrested for being “unruly.” Max was detained for the weekend, was never charged with a crime \nother than being “unruly,” which is not a detainable offense. \n139.  The staff at the DIDS facility continue to frequently call the police on Max over \nsimilar, non-criminal behaviors.  \n140.  Recently, the home manager at the DIDS facility locked Max out of the home and \ncalled the police on him. Max was so distraught that he was actively attempting to cut his wrists \nwhen first responders arrived; an EMT had to remove the cutting object from Max’s hands to \nprevent further self-harm. \n141.  Not long after this incident, Max asked the facility to call an ambulance because he \nwas experiencing suicidal ideation. Although the facility has called 911 on several occasions \nagainst Max, they refused to call emergency services at Max’s request. \n142.  DCS failed and continues to fail to take any action against the residential facility \nfor their mistreatment of Max. DCS has left Max at this same facility, where he remains to this \nday. \n143.  As a result of DCS’s failures, Max has suffered and continues to suffer emotional \nand psychological harm. DCS has destabilized him by moving him from place to place; despite \nthis frequent movement, DCS is unable or unwilling to place Max in a safe home. DCS has \nknowingly deprived Max of his right to safety while in its care and continues to subject him to \ncaregivers who abuse him. \nII.  Defendants \n144.

DCS is the state agency in Tennessee responsible for overseeing child welfare, yet \nit has consistently failed to uphold its duty to protect the vulnerable children in its care. DCS is \ncharged with five overarching missions: (1) protect children from abuse, mistreatment, or neglect; \n(2) provide prevention, early intervention, rehabilitative and educational services; (3) pursue \nappropriate and effective behavioral and mental health treatment; (4) ensure that health care needs, \nboth preventative and practical, are met; and (5) keep children safe. Tenn Code Ann. § 37-5-102. \n35 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 35 of 74 PageID #: 35\n\n \nDCS fails on all five counts. DCS’s foster care system and child protective services are plagued \nby systemic failures that cause foster children physical and psychological harm, leave them \nwithout stability in their home life and community, and deprive them of necessary treatment and \nservices. DCS leaves children to languish in their deeply flawed foster system for years without a \nclear path to a permanent home.  \nA.  Comptroller Audits Reveal Persistent Failures in Tennessee’s Child Welfare \nSystem \n \n148.  The Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury conducts audits and oversight of state \nagencies, including DCS. Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-29-111. Since 1997, the Comptroller’s Office has \nconducted multiple Performance Audit Reports of DCS. In its most recent audit of DCS in 2022, \nthe Comptroller found that “[t]he Department of Children’s Services is struggling to provide \nsupport services to Tennessee’s most vulnerable children and youth.”  \n149.  The  audit  revealed  a  consistent  pattern  of  DCS’s  failure  to  address  critical \ndeficiencies in child welfare despite repeated findings, recommendations, and calls for reform. \nDespite the identification of severe and pervasive problems in prior audits (most recently in 2016 \nand 2019), the 2022 Comptroller’s audit “found that DCS did not assess risks or develop controls \nin several areas that we have both previously reported and found in the current audit.” \n150.  The Comptroller identified four major, recurring issues which they had identified \nin multiple reports going back several years, and which DCS has made no efforts to fix. Case \nmanager turnover and staffing shortages have worsened over time, with high turnover rates and \nunmanageable caseloads leading to delays in child protection, investigations, and placements. By \n2022, the staffing crisis had reached a breaking point, severely hindering DCS’s ability to meet its \nobligations to children in state custody. \n36 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 36 of 74 PageID #: 36\n\n \n151.  Additionally, child placements and institutionalization have remained significant \nconcerns. As early as 2016, audit reports warned of a lack of appropriate placements for children \nwith complex needs, leading to an over-reliance on institutional care. The 2019 audit report \nreinforced these concerns, noting a shortage of long-term, family-like placement options. By 2022, \nthe situation had become dire, with DCS housing children in state office buildings and sending \nthem out of state due to a severe shortage of foster homes and therapeutic placements. \n152.  The audits have also repeatedly flagged DCS’s inadequate response to child safety \nand  abuse  investigations.  In  2019,  audit  reports  documented  oversight  failures  in  handling \nallegations  of  abuse  and  neglect.  By  2022,  these  deficiencies  had  escalated,  with  children \nremaining in unsafe environments due to DCS’s failure to meet investigation timelines.  \n153.  At that point, the audit showed that DCS lacked a consistent process for responding \nto allegations of sexual abuse and harassment within residential facilities, putting vulnerable \nchildren at increased risk of harm. \n154.  Finally, persistent failures in case management and data tracking have plagued DCS \noperations. By 2022, TFACTS, the agency’s case management system, had become a major barrier \nto efficiency, with the Comptroller finding that outdated technology caused delays in placement \ndecisions, financial processing, and case tracking. \n155.  Although DCS put into place some improvements during the years the Brian A. \nreforms  were  required,  the  audits  show  that  the  steps  toward  these  reforms  were  not \ninstitutionalized and were abandoned with the termination of the Brian A. case.  \nII.  Safety in Placements \n156.  Risk and safety assessments identify pending dangers or threats regarding a child; \nafter dangers are identified, workable safety plans ensure that a child can remain with a family in \n37 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 37 of 74 PageID #: 37\n\n \na safe and stable way. Where identified risks cannot be mitigated by safety plans or where the \nfamily caring for the child is unable to fulfill the requirements of a safety plan, the child can be \nmoved to a more appropriate home or other location that can meet his/her needs. It is critical for \ncaseworkers to conduct timely and accurate assessments on an ongoing basis and to monitor the \nexecution of safety plans. The Administration for Children and Families, an office within the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, audits every state’s performance in this area and other \ncritical metrics of child welfare via Child and Family Service Reviews (“CFSRs”).  \n157.  In the most recent CFSR for Tennessee from 2024, DCS only conducted adequate \nrisk and safety assessment and management in 50% of foster cases reviewed, an alarming statistic \nthat demonstrates a failure to ensure proper placements and to protect children from harm.  \n158.  Tennessee does not track foster homes disqualified due to background checks on a \nstatewide basis, nor does it have an accurate statewide system that would allow it to do so, leaving \nthe potential for prospective foster families, turned down in one county, to go on to another county \nwithout addressing the issues rendering them unfit to foster. \n159.  DCS is responsible for ensuring the safety and well-being of foster children placed \nin residential facilities. However, repeated failures in oversight, investigation, and compliance with \nfederal standards have left children vulnerable to sexual abuse and neglect.  \n160.   According  to  DCS  policy,  their  Special  Investigations  Unit  is  supposed  to \ninvestigate all allegations of abuse or neglect of children in foster care; however, in 2021, DCS \ndid not investigate 34 out of 211 (16.1%) allegations of sexual abuse and/or sexual harassment \nwithin residential facilities. Instead, DCS refers complaints about abuse in facilities to law \nenforcement to investigate. DCS does not track the referrals nor follow up with law enforcement \n38 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 38 of 74 PageID #: 38\n\n \nto learn the results of the investigations. DCS does not conduct investigations nor referrals \nregarding sexual harassment complaints. \n161.  DCS also fails to investigate facilities for lack of supervision in connection with \nreports of sexual activity between children at residential facilities.  \n162.  Further, DCS utilizes residential facilities that house both foster children and youth \ninvolved in the juvenile justice system, meaning that foster children are frequently placed in the \nsame settings as those involved with juvenile justice. \n163.  Of the sexual abuse investigations performed by DCS in 2021, 92% were not \ncompleted  within  the  required  time  frame.  On  average,  the  sampled  investigations  took \napproximately 50%-100% longer than allowed by DCS policy.  \n164.  DCS’s failure to investigate all allegations of sexual abuse and failure to conduct \nor complete their investigations timely puts children into the very danger that may have instigated \na child’s removal from their home. \n165.  DCS’s systemic failure to properly investigate allegations of sexual abuse and \nharassment in residential facilities perpetuates a dangerous environment for the children it is meant \nto protect.  \nIII.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Fuel Tennessee’s Placement Crisis \nA.  Placement Instability and Lack of Foster Homes \n166.  When children cannot remain safely in their own homes, DCS is responsible for \nproviding placements that meet their emotional, physical, and social needs. However, DCS’s \ninability to recruit and maintain available foster homes continues to present serious challenges to \nDCS’s ability to make appropriate placement decisions. Case managers frequently resort to placing \nchildren in temporary accommodations such as state office buildings or transitional facilities for \n39 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 39 of 74 PageID #: 39\n\n \nextended durations. Compounding this issue, the case management system is ill-equipped to \ncapture real-time child placement data or track placement availability, creating negative impacts \nfor both children and DCS employees. \n167.  Child welfare policy prioritizes placing children in foster care within family-like \nenvironments, ideally close to their home communities and, whenever possible, with kin caregivers \nand siblings. Providing stable and appropriate placements is essential to protecting children’s well-\nbeing and maintaining family bonds. However, due to a lack of adequately supported foster homes \nand specialized treatment programs, DCS often moves children frequently among various foster \nhomes, institutions, group settings, and other temporary or emergency placements. This shortage \nof foster homes has resulted in an overreliance on placements that fail to meet children’s needs, \nincluding unsafe or inappropriate congregate care facilities. \n168.  DCS’s placement system is based on a rotation of various on-call placement \nworkers from a shared group of multiple counties. Its use of this system often results in placement \nof children in the county where the on-call worker is assigned and familiar with the pool of foster \nparents rather than in a placement within their county of origin. This system unnecessarily \nseparates children from their natural community support, places barriers on therapy and visitation \nwith their family of origin, and causes unnecessary removals from their schools. For children with \nspecial education needs, this is especially disruptive.  \n169.  DCS has failed to maintain an adequate pool of foster and adoptive families, leaving \nchildren without stable placements and failing to ensure families reflect the racial and ethnic \ndiversity of those in need.  \n170.  DCS fails to properly support its foster families, particularly those foster families \nwho have high-needs foster children in their homes. DCS frequently places foster children with \n40 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 40 of 74 PageID #: 40\n\n \nfoster parents who lack the training or experience necessary to support high-needs foster children. \nDCS often places these high-needs foster children in homes without ever informing the foster \nfamilies of the children’s needs. DCS then fails to provide the services to the child or the foster \nfamily which might enable the family to provide a stable home and threatens retaliation against \nfamilies who request aid. As a result, foster parents often request removal of children they are not \nequipped to raise, foster parents close their homes to future foster children, and prospective foster \nparents are dissuaded from becoming certified foster homes. \n171.  Placement instability triggers a cascade of overlapping and compounding harms, \nincluding: (i) disruption of a child’s sense of security and attachment to caregivers; (ii) re-\ntraumatization by repeating the experience of removal; (iii) decreased chances of reunification and \nexiting care, along with an increased risk of re-entering care after reunification; (iv) interruptions \nin education; (v) loss of opportunities to build long-term relationships with supportive adults; (vi) \nheightened vulnerability to abuse and neglect; (vii) developmental delays or setbacks due to \ninconsistent caregiving and disrupted attachment; (viii) an increased likelihood of running away \nfrom  placements;  (ix)  interruptions  in  a  child’s  therapeutic  relationship  with  mental  health \nproviders and gaps in treatment; (x) worsening mental health symptoms; (xi) delays in diagnosis \nor access to mental health treatment; (xii) difficulties developing coping skills and adaptive \nbehaviors to manage stress and emotions; and (xiii) higher rates of juvenile delinquency and \ninstitutionalization. \n172.  According to a report by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth, in \n2022, Tennessee ranked number one in the nation for how often it moved foster children among \ndifferent placements. \n41 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 41 of 74 PageID #: 41\n\n \n173.  In FY2023, 33% of children in the foster care system experienced instability, \nhaving been moved to three or more placements within a single year. This alarming trend is not \nlimited to children already in care. Among first-time foster children who entered the system in \n2022, 38% had experienced three or more placements by December 31, 2023. For children entering \nin 2023, 31% had already experienced three placements by the end of the year. \nB.  Temporary Placements \n174.  Because DCS does not maintain enough appropriate placements, it houses children \nin unsuitable and temporary settings, including office buildings, hotels, hospitals, transitional \nhousing, “Isaiah” houses (run by independent non-profits), assessment centers, and Department of \nDisability  and  Aging  (“DDA”)  Supported  Living  Protocols  operated  by  rotating  caregivers \n(assessment centers for children with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities). Despite \nDefendant Quin’s assurances to state lawmakers that children were no longer sleeping in DCS \noffices except in Shelby County as of March 2023, records show that office stays resumed by \nNovember 2023 and continued into 2024. Contrary to her claims, nearly 100 children have spent \nnights in DCS offices this year. Children subjected to these placements frequently experience \nmonths of instability, living in conditions that lack basic necessities. DCS caseworkers say this is \na pattern, not an exception. DCS has no policies to ensure that these settings are adequately \nsupplied with food, toiletries, and other necessities. Because DCS has abdicated its responsibility \nto consistently provide these necessities, these sites are often supplied by community donations, \nresulting in varying levels of support.  \n175.  The Deputy Commissioner for Child Programs acknowledged that children are \noften forced to stay overnight in temporary settings because providers are unwilling to accept high-\n42 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 42 of 74 PageID #: 42\n\n \nneeds children. Without proper placements, children requiring specialized care are left in limbo, \ncompounding their trauma and destabilizing their futures. \ni.  Transitional Placements, Assessment Centers, and DDA Supported \nLiving Protocols \n176.  DCS uses a number of temporary placements, including transitional placements, \nassessment centers, “Isaiah Houses” (run by independent non-profits), DDA Supported Living \nProtocols, and intake centers. \n177.  According to DCS policy, children are placed in assessment centers for the purpose \nof assessing their needs. DCS policy limits the maximum length of stay in an assessment center to \n30 days. \n178.  Contrary to policy, most children placed in these assessment centers are there for \nfar longer than 30 days; it is rare that DCS and their contracted providers even complete the child’s \nassessment within 30 days.  \n179.  DCS subjects the children at assessment centers to draconian conditions more \ncommonly found in adult prisons. Intake centers are routinely staffed by personnel from the \nsheriff’s department. DCS is explicitly authorized to shackle children when they are taken off-site \nfor doctor’s appointments and other visits. Policies allow the use of chemical weapons, such as \npepper-spray, against children. DCS limits children’s in-person and telephonic communication and \nmonitors children’s calls, including calls to family and to their GALs. GALs have been prevented \nfrom seeing children they represent. One assessment center located at the Clover Bottom campus \nin Nashville is surrounded by barbed wire, which was installed only after DCS began using the \ncampus as an assessment center. \n43 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 43 of 74 PageID #: 43\n\n \n180.  According  to  DCS  policy,  children  with  intellectual  and/or  developmental \ndisabilities are placed in DDA Supported Living Protocols for the purpose of assessing their needs. \nDCS policy limits the maximum length of stay in DDA Supported Living Protocols to 30 days.  \n181.  DDA Supported Living Protocols are staffed by contract agencies that employ \nrotating hourly caseworkers that lack the specialized training and capabilities required to provide \nservices for children with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. Children placed in these \nhomes have very little supervision and support.  \n182.  Contrary to policy, children placed in these Supported Living Protocols are there \nfor far longer than 30 days; it is rare that DCS and their contracted providers even complete the \nchild’s assessment within 30 days. In spite of these children having known intellectual and/or \ndevelopmental disabilities, DCS fails to ensure their special educational needs are met, fails to \nprovide them with adequate services to support their disabilities, and fails to ensure they are \nreceiving services in the most integrated setting.  \n183.  The living conditions in many of the temporary placement buildings are dangerous. \nUpon information and belief, several buildings have holes in the walls and exposed electrical \nwiring. One of the three large centers in the state, Resource Linkage, is housed in a building that \nwas closed under Brian A., in part, due to lead in the water pipes. Signs above every water fountain \nand sink stated, “Non-potable water. Do not drink.” \n184.  The food provided at these temporary placements is inadequate and unhealthy. \nUpon information and belief, children are not fed regular and substantive meals. Many of the \nbuildings lack kitchen facilities; DCS feeds children only food that can be prepared in air-fryers \nor microwaves, such as chicken nuggets, French fries, or Hot Pockets. Breakfast often consists \nsolely of doughnuts.  \n44 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 44 of 74 PageID #: 44\n\n \n185.  DCS creates dangerous situations by mixing children of varying ages, genders, and \nreasons for placement, and by mixing children with delinquency findings with children removed \nfrom their homes due to abuse or neglect. Children as young as seven years old are placed in spaces \nwith teenagers. Boys and girls are often placed together, requiring shared bathrooms. Children \ncharged with violent criminal offenses are placed together with children removed from their homes \ndue to the trauma of inflicted violence; boys with rape and assault charges are placed together with \ngirls. \n186.  During  these  months-long  stays,  children  do  not  receive  treatment  for  their \nbehavioral/mental health needs. Upon information and belief, mental health professionals are \nrarely, if ever, in-house at the centers. Although in theory, DCS will drive children to the offices \nof mental health professionals, this rarely occurs in practice; many mental health professionals \nrefuse to work with DCS because of DCS’s track record of not paying the contracted rate for their \nservices. \nIV.  Permanency \n187.  The primary objective of foster care is to provide children with a temporary, secure, \nand nurturing environment, while their parents work to resolve the challenges that led to their \nseparation. When reunification is not an option, a foster care system must take prompt action to \nestablish permanency through adoption or guardianship, often with relatives. Ensuring stability is \nessential for a child’s emotional, educational, and social well-being, as extended time in foster care \ncan undermine their sense of security and lead to lasting negative effects. \n188.  DCS caseworker permanency plans are critical to a child’s progress out of the foster \nsystem. Permanency plans identify a permanency goal (e.g., reunification, adoption) and the steps \nneeded to achieve this goal. In the most recent CFSR report, appropriate permanency goals were \n45 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 45 of 74 PageID #: 45\n\n \nonly rated as a strength in 36% of cases. Without consistent and timely oversight, children are left \nin a state of limbo, unable to achieve the permanency they need for long-term and mental health. \n189.  Even when permanency goals are identified, DCS still causes children to languish \nin foster care unnecessarily. In 2022, children with a permanency goal of adoption, and whose \nparental rights have been terminated in furtherance of that goal, still waited 27.5 months on average \nbefore being adopted, over 8 months longer than the national average.  \nV.  Workloads and Staffing \n190.  Qualified caseworkers are vital to the administration of every child welfare system. \nThey are responsible for ensuring the safety, permanency, and well-being of children who are at \nrisk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. To carry out this critical task, they must assess the needs of \neach child and family, develop individualized plans to meet those needs, and monitor progress \ntoward achieving the desired outcomes. \n191.  Manageable  caseloads  are  necessary  to  the  provision  of  comprehensive  and \nindividualized services to each child and family in a caseworker’s care. Having a manageable \ncaseload requires few enough cases so that workers can take the time to build rapport, engage in \nmeaningful conversations, and identify the unique needs and strengths of each child and family. \nAdditionally, caseworkers must work collaboratively with other professionals and community \nresources to address complex issues and provide timely interventions. Without the capacity to \nperform these duties, caseworkers cannot ensure that foster children are safe, supported, and able \nto thrive in their families and communities. \n192.  When caseloads exceed reasonable professional standards, caseworkers are unable \nto devote the necessary time and attention to each child in their care. Additionally, overburdened \nworkers often experience burnout and high levels of stress, leading to turnover and a shortage of \n46 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 46 of 74 PageID #: 46\n\n \nexperienced  workers.  High  turnover  increases  caseload  burdens  on  remaining  caseworkers, \nreduces productivity and morale, and increases feelings of hopelessness and frustration.  \n193.  Caseworker turnover commonly results in delayed permanency for foster children. \nOne study found that foster children with one caseworker in a given year had an approximately \n75% chance of achieving permanency, those with two caseworkers had an approximately 18% \nchance of permanency, and those with more than three caseworkers had only a 2% chance of \npermanency.  \n194.  Caseworker turnover in Tennessee is high, with an average statewide turnover rate \nof 27%. One in four counties has a turnover rate higher than 40%. \n195.  While monitored pursuant to the Brian A. settlement, Tennessee achieved and \nmaintained an average caseload of 20 children per case manager in 2017, a standard that was \ncodified in Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-5-132.  \n196.  After DCS was released from Brian A.’s mandated oversight, caseloads quickly \nballooned. From 2020 to 2022, caseloads increased by 63%. Regional caseload averages rose to \nas much as double the statutory maximum, with over one-third (37%) of case managers carrying \nmore than the statutory maximum in May 2022. \n197.  In 2023, Defendant Quin announced a caseload maximum of ten cases per first-\nyear caseworker. Upon information and belief, that standard is not followed, and average caseloads \ndo not indicate how many individual workers are within that limit. Upon information and belief, \nnew caseworkers perform much of the workload for cases that are listed under supervisors’ names. \n198.  On March 4, 2024, Defendant Quin testified to the Tennessee House Government \nOperations Committee that Davidson County’s recent average caseload was fifty cases. She further \n47 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 47 of 74 PageID #: 47\n\n \ntestified that the lowest average, after a “surge event” focused on closing cases, was twenty-nine \ncases. \n199.  As a result, the amount of overtime for caseworkers has steadily risen. 80% of \ncaseworkers worked overtime in fiscal year 2022. Although about 15 hours of overtime per \ncaseworker was reported, DCS supervisors frequently requested that case managers not report their \novertime.  \n200.  In addition to overwhelming case responsibilities, caseworkers are required to work \novernight at transitional placements and office buildings where children are housed. Frequently, \nthis overnight shift is bookended with regular day shifts both before and afterward. \n201.  As a result of DCS’s practices, turnover and vacancy rates have skyrocketed. The \nannual case manager turnover rate rose from 15.5% in 2018 to 55.5% in 2022. In 2021, 97% of \ncase managers left DCS. Case manager vacancy rates rose from 6.5% in 2017 to 22% in 2022. \nVI.  Oversight Over Contracted Private Providers \n202.  DCS routinely contracts out their casework duties to the same private organizations \ncontracted to provide placements. Children who have a private agency caseworker frequently do \nnot have a worker from DCS. Upon information and belief, these private caseworkers do not \nreceive training in DCS policies or protocols, nor is there oversight by the public agency over the \nprivate caseworkers.  \n203.  Complaints about private casework and private provider employees are reviewed \nby the same private provider who employs them. Foster children, GALs, and other involved \nindividuals are frequently unable to reach anyone at DCS who is willing to claim responsibility \nfor overseeing contractors. Similarly, complaints of abuse at private facilities that house children \nin DCS custody are investigated by the same providers running those facilities. \n48 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 48 of 74 PageID #: 48\n\n \nVII.  Case Plans \n204.  DCS is required under federal law to provide children in foster care with a case plan \nthat is reviewed regularly, at least once every six months, until a child’s case is resolved and the \nchild leaves DCS custody. Federal law requires case plans to include a large amount of information \nabout the child and family, to identify necessary services and to focus on ways to resolve the case \nand support the foster child, including plans to effectively engage family members and services to \naddress the family’s and the child’s needs. In addition, the plans require ongoing monitoring by \nDCS to ensure that the child’s case is making progress toward its goals. \n205.  In recognition of the importance of timely, individualized, and appropriate case \nplans, the Brian A. settlement required DCS to hold CFTMs at least every three months; although \nDCS achieved this standard when monitored in 2016 and 2017, it has since fallen woefully short. \n206.  The 2024 CFSR, the most recent federal review of Tennessee’s child welfare \nsystem, found that periodic reviews of case plans were often not held in a timely manner. Upon \ninformation and belief, in some cases, CFTMs are held as little as once per year.  \n207.  The CFSR also found that case plans are generic, not individualized to the child’s \nneeds, and are not regularly updated to reflect changing circumstances. Of the case plans that exist, \nDCS only identifies appropriate permanency goals in 40% of sampled cases. Of the files sampled \nin the CFSR, children’s files lacked ongoing risk assessment in 50% of cases. 100% of cases \nsampled either did not have an ongoing risk assessment at all or had an incomplete risk assessment \nwhich only focused on pre-identified concerns instead of conducting a fresh assessment to discover \nareas of concern.  \nVIII.  Unnecessary Use of Residential Placements \n \nA.  Insufficient Access to Community-Based Services for Children in DCS Care \nLeads to Increased Institutional Placement \n49 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 49 of 74 PageID #: 49\n\n \n \n208.  Members of the ADA Subclass are “qualified individuals with disability[ies]” as \ndefined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), and its regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. A disability \nis “(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities \nof such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an \nimpairment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); 28 C.F.R. § 35.108. \n209.  Under the ADA, individuals with disabilities are entitled to receive goods, services, \nfacilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto their needs. An integrated setting is “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact \nwith nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. B. \n210.  DCS has failed to uphold this mandate by systematically and unnecessarily placing \nchildren with complex needs—particularly those with disabilities—in institutional settings rather \nthan in family-like, community-based placements where they receive home and community-based \nmental, physical, and behavioral health services.  \n211.  Similarly, DCS systematically places children with complex needs and disabilities \ninto unnecessarily restrictive institutional settings where a more integrated institutional level of \ncare or placement in a therapeutic foster home would be appropriate. \n212.  Case  managers  across  Tennessee  consistently  report  significant  challenges  in \nsecuring long-term, stable placements for children who require higher levels of care. In a recent \nbudget meeting, DCS data revealed a troubling trend: over the past four years, the Department has \nincreasingly relied on its most restrictive and costly services, while community-based options have \ndeclined.  \n213.  Although DCS justifies this by claiming that necessary services are unavailable, \nthis reasoning ignores the Department’s legal obligation to develop services that enable children \n50 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 50 of 74 PageID #: 50\n\n \nwith disabilities to receive care in the least restrictive, most integrated setting appropriate for their \nneeds, and to ensure that the services are adjusted so that children with disabilities can equally \nbenefit from those services. \n214.  Rather  than  investing  in  therapeutic  foster  care,  wraparound  services,  and \ncommunity-based treatment options, DCS has chosen to rely on segregated institutional settings, \ndepriving children of the opportunity to grow and develop in environments that promote family \nand community connections.  \n215.  Once placed in out-of-state or institutional settings, children are often left there long \nafter they could be safely transitioned to less restrictive environments. DCS has failed to take \nmeaningful steps to integrate these children back into their communities or ensure they receive the \nnecessary support to remain in family-like settings. \n216.  By  systematically  denying  children  access  to  appropriate  community-based \nservices and placements, DCS has violated its duty to ensure that children with disabilities receive \ncare in the most integrated setting possible. This failure represents a substantial departure from \nprofessional standards in child welfare and demonstrates deliberate indifference to the well-being \nof the children in its custody. \n \n \nB.  Lack of In-State Residential Placements \n217.  DCS is facing a critical shortage of in-state placements for children with complex \nmental health and behavioral needs, exacerbated by its failure to provide sufficient supportive \nservices to children in specialized, therapeutic foster homes.  \n51 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 51 of 74 PageID #: 51\n\n \n218.  DCS’s failure to anticipate and plan for the rising demand for more intensive and \nspecialized care has exacerbated the crisis, leaving some of Tennessee’s most vulnerable children \nwithout appropriate in-state treatment options.   \n219.  From January 2018 to July 2022, the number of children in DCS custody increased \nby 7%, yet DCS leadership failed to take sufficient action to prepare for a corresponding increase \nin the need for foster homes, treatment facilities, and secure residential placements. The Council \non Accreditation, which sets national best practice standards for child and family services, \nrecommends that agencies proactively recruit a diverse array of foster and treatment placements \nto ensure that children receive safe, consistent, and nurturing care. Tennessee’s failure to adhere \nto these recommended practices has contributed to the growing placement crisis, particularly for \nchildren requiring specialized treatment. \n220.  The severity of mental health issues among children in state custody has increased, \nyet Tennessee lacks the necessary infrastructure, resources, and trained foster families to meet \ntheir needs. Foster parents report that they do not receive adequate support or training to care for \nchildren with significant psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, or behavioral challenges.  \n221.  As a result, Tennessee sends an increasing number of children to out-of-state \nplacements, many of which also do not have appropriate programs to address the needs of children \nsent to them, and many of which have questionable programs and a shortage of appropriate \nstaffing. As of November 2024, DCS had more than 200 children in out-of-state institutions. These \nfacilities span 15 different states, including Alabama, Utah, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and South \nCarolina. \n52 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 52 of 74 PageID #: 52\n\n \n222.  Tennessee’s inability to provide in-state care for children with complex needs is a \ndirect result of poor planning, and a failure to develop sufficient residential and therapeutic foster \ncare resources. \n223.  DCS officials have acknowledged the urgent need for expanded residential capacity \nand more trained therapeutic foster homes. DCS has acknowledged the urgent need for more in-\nstate placement options and trained therapeutic foster homes, but its solution—the DCS Real \nEstate Plan—falls short. Instead of prioritizing community-based care, the plan relies on building \nor converting large, institutional facilities that do little more than warehouse children within state \nlines.  \nIX.  Lack of Education \n224.  The Tennessee Constitution affords all Tennessee children the right to an education. \nTenn. Const. Art. XI, § 12. Tennessee law affords all children with disabilities the right to a free \nand appropriate public education which includes the provision of “special education and related \nservices designed to meet the child’s unique needs.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-10-103. However, \nDCS routinely deprives children of education for weeks or months at a time. \n225.  DCS frequently moves children to night-to-night placements, bringing them to a \ndifferent location every night. During the day, DCS places these children at group centers such as \nResource Linkage. While bouncing these children from place to place, DCS either fails to enroll \nchildren in school or fails to transport children to their schools. Due to lack of placement \navailability, DCS keeps these children in placement limbo, without education for significant \nperiods of time. \n226.  DCS provides laptops for online schooling in some of their temporary placements; \nhowever, it does not provide the internet access necessary to connect to educational lessons and \n53 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 53 of 74 PageID #: 53\n\n \nmaterials. Caseworkers are forced to use their work phones (if provided) or their personal phones \nas “hot-spots” for children to access schoolwork. \n227.  DCS purports to provide on-site education to children at assessment centers; \nhowever,  upon  information  and  belief,  DCS  does  not  provide  any  teachers,  instruction,  or \nopportunities for interaction or collaboration with educators. Instead, DCS distributes worksheets \nto  the  children  at  assessment  centers  without  any  support  or  guidance  to  complete  them. \nFrequently, the worksheets provided fall far below the grade level of the children receiving them, \ndepriving children of an appropriate education. \n228.  DCS applies their worksheet distribution system to all children at assessment \ncenters, regardless of their needs, diagnoses, or IEPs.  \nX.  Lack of Medical Care \n229.  Ensuring that children and youth in the custody of DCS receive adequate medical \nand dental care is critical to the children’s health and well-being. Regular preventive care, early \ndiagnosis, and treatment are essential to restoring and maintaining children’s health.  \n230.  Under the Medicaid Act, a state which accepts federal Medicaid funding must meet \nminimum  federal  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Social  Security  Act  and  its  implementing \nregulations. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). Tennessee has accepted federal funding and is so bound. Tenn. \nCode Ann. § 71-5-101 et seq. \n231.  The Medicaid Act requires Tennessee to provide medical assistance, including \nservices  known  as  “Early  and  Periodic  Screening,  Diagnostic,  and  Treatment  Services” \n(“EPSDT”)  for  children  who  are  eligible  for  Medicaid.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396a(a)(10)(A), \n1396d(a)(4)(B). Foster children are eligible for Medicaid, which Tennessee administers through \nthe state agency TennCare. \n54 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 54 of 74 PageID #: 54\n\n \n232.  States are required to provide screenings to identify children’s mental and physical \nhealth needs, as well as arrange for treatment services necessary to correct or ameliorate a child’s \nmental  or  physical  health  conditions.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396a(a)(10)(A);  1396a(a)(43)(C); \n1396d(a)(4)(B); 1396d(r)(1); 396d(r)(5).  \n233.  DCS’s Office of Child Health is responsible for ensuring that all children in its \ncustody receive appropriate health care. Each of the 12 DCS regions has a regional health team, \nincluding a regional nurse consultant, a health advocacy representative, and a service appeals \ntracking coordinator, which coordinates with TennCare and enters medical data into TFACTS. \nHowever, systemic failures within DCS, including an overreliance on outdated paper forms and \nmanual processes, have led to significant delays and mismanagement in providing necessary \nhealthcare services to children in foster care. \n234.  DCS  must  provide  the  required  initial  EPSDT  screenings  with  “reasonable \npromptness.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396(a)(8). DCS policy mandates that all children receive initial EPSDT \nmedical screenings within 30 days of entering custody. Additionally, all children 12 months or \nolder must receive a dental examination within 30 days of entering custody and every six months \nthereafter, pursuant to the schedule recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. \nDespite these requirements, DCS routinely fails to meet these deadlines, preventing early detection \nof medical and dental conditions and leaving children vulnerable to untreated health issues. \n235.   DCS’s reliance on manual, paper-based processes to complete, review, and follow \nup on children’s medical and dental screenings has created systemic errors and significant delays \nin  services.  The  inefficiencies  in  these  outdated  processes  introduce  opportunities  for \nmismanagement, missing documentation, and delays in critical follow-ups.  \n55 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 55 of 74 PageID #: 55\n\n \n236.  The quality of medical data recorded in TFACTS is unreliable, raising concerns \nabout the accuracy of children’s medical records. Due to inconsistencies in documentation, neither \nDCS management nor external auditors can confidently verify whether children receive the care \nthey need. The lack of a reliable medical tracking system increases the risk that children with \nurgent healthcare needs will go unnoticed. Delays in screening reviews prevent children from \nreceiving timely medical interventions, worsen undiagnosed health conditions, and deprive case \nmanagers of the ability to make informed decisions about children’s healthcare needs.  \n237.  The high turnover rate of case managers and excessive caseloads further contribute \nto delays in healthcare. Case managers are responsible for ensuring that children receive timely \nscreenings, follow-up care, and necessary treatments. However, when case managers frequently \nleave their positions, new caseworkers must take over unfamiliar cases, often with incomplete or \nmissing  medical  records.  This  results  in  children  missing  critical  health  appointments, \nexperiencing gaps in treatment, and remaining in limbo while waiting for necessary care. \n238.  Mental health services remain inadequate across Tennessee, with children in foster \ncare frequently unable to access trauma-informed therapy, psychiatric evaluations, and behavioral \nhealth interventions. DCS’s failure to provide timely medical and dental screenings, combined \nwith systemic inefficiencies, provider shortages, and case manager turnover, has had devastating \nconsequences for the children in its custody. Many children are left without necessary treatments, \nworsening  their  existing  health  conditions  and  increasing  the  risk  of  long-term  medical \ncomplications.  In  addition,  children  with  severe  mental  health  needs  remain  untreated, \nexacerbating their behavioral challenges and hindering their ability to achieve stable placements. \n239.  Tennessee’s high rate of foster instability combined with the network adequacy \nissues for behavioral health treatment results in frequent delays for children to begin receiving \n56 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 56 of 74 PageID #: 56\n\n \nservices and large gaps in receipt of services each time a child loses a placement and has to go \nback on the wait list for services in their new placement location. DCS regularly fails to search for \nnew providers in the child’s new location for extended periods of time after a change in placement. \nXI.  Failure to Establish a Reliable Information System \n240.  A reliable and functional information system is an essential component of an \neffective foster care system. To ensure the safety and well-being of children, caseworkers must \nhave access to accurate, complete, and easily accessible information that allows them to make \ninformed  decisions  about  placements,  case  management,  and  child  welfare  interventions. \nHowever, TFACTS, the central database used by DCS, has been plagued by systemic failures since \nits implementation in 2010. These ongoing technical deficiencies, system inefficiencies, and \nreporting inaccuracies have severely hindered DCS’s ability to manage cases effectively. \n241.  TFACTS was intended to serve as the primary case management tool for tracking \nplacements,  ensuring  compliance  with  medical  and  dental  screenings,  managing  financial \ntransactions,  and  facilitating  oversight  of  foster  care  cases.  However,  persistent  system \nmalfunctions have forced caseworkers to rely on cumbersome manual processes, spreadsheets, \nemails, and phone calls to obtain critical information, leading to delays in case management, \nmiscommunication, and failures in child welfare oversight. \n242.  Since its launch, TFACTS has been riddled with system functionality issues, \nincluding slow system processing, unexpected user logouts, and the inability to generate accurate \nprogram  reports.  In  2021,  DCS  implemented  a  financial  enhancement  feature  designed  to \nstreamline payments to foster parents and private providers. While this update improved financial \ntransactions, the update caused significant problems with other parts of the system, including \ndisruptions to case management data, limitations in system reporting capabilities, and delays in \n57 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 57 of 74 PageID #: 57\n\n \naccessing essential case information. As a result, DCS employees were left unable to run critical \nprogram reports or verify data accuracy, further undermining the Department’s ability to manage \nchild welfare cases effectively. \n243.   The inadequacy of TFACTS has forced case managers and regional administrators \nto  create  their  own  makeshift  tracking  systems.  Because  TFACTS  lacks  real-time  tracking \ncapabilities, case managers must manually search for placement availability using phone calls, \nemails, and spreadsheets, instead of relying on an automated system. This outdated approach leads \nto  delays  in  finding  appropriate  placements  for  children  in  foster  care  and  contributes  to \nunnecessary disruptions in children’s lives. \n244.  One of the most serious deficiencies of TFACTS is its inability to accurately record \nand track child placements. When children are placed in temporary settings such as state offices, \nhotels, or transitional placements, the system can only record the child’s location as a “regional \nstate office,” rather than identifying the specific placement. As a result, DCS management lacks \nvisibility into the actual whereabouts of children in custody, creating accountability gaps and \nmaking it impossible to track children in real time and to determine the additional services needed. \nEach DCS region has been forced to maintain independent Excel spreadsheets to track children in \ntemporary placements, leading to fragmented and unreliable data, and an inability to track where \nserious problems arise. \n245.  The number of temporary placements has increased, yet top DCS management \nremains unaware of the number and location of children in these placements due to the system’s \ntracking failures. Without an accurate, centralized placement tracking system, case managers \nstruggle to locate available beds, delaying placements and prolonging instability for children. \n58 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 58 of 74 PageID #: 58\n\n \n246.  The inefficiencies of TFACTS have directly contributed to delays in finding stable \nplacements, ensuring timely medical care, and preventing disruptions in services. Case managers \nalready struggle under heavy caseloads, staff shortages, and high turnover rates, and the additional \nadministrative burden caused by system failures further prevents them from effectively serving \nchildren in foster care.  \n247.  TFACTS also fails to automate and aggregate data needed to track systemic child \nabuse trends. The Special Investigations Unit (“SIU”) monthly report is intended to flag patterns \nof abuse by identifying individuals with ten or more instances of abuse. However, TFACTS cannot \naccurately generate this data, forcing staff to manually count investigations and input findings into \nspreadsheets. This process is highly susceptible to human error, with investigators miscounting \ncases or failing to identify repeat offenders due to duplicate profiles in TFACTS.  \n248.  DCS’s failure to maintain a functional and accurate information system is a primary \ncause of delayed services, missed visits, and harmful placements. \n \nXII.  Tennessee’s Troubled Child Welfare History \n249.  The 2022 Performance Audit Report by the Department of the Comptroller is the \nlatest in a long line of documents detailing DCS’s failures. Audits by the Department of the \nComptroller describe these failures repeatedly over the course of three decades, and DCS’s lack \nof action to remedy them.  \n250.  DCS met the required Brian A. settlement metrics by 2017, leading the court to \nterminate jurisdiction over all metrics on July 17, 2017. Unfortunately, DCS’s performance \ndeclined soon after. Today, DCS’s performance in many areas has sunk to pre-Brian A. levels. \n59 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 59 of 74 PageID #: 59\n\n \na.  In January 2017, DCS had a rate of 96% compliance with the required \naverage caseload limit of 20 cases per caseworker. By fiscal year 2019, \ncompliance dropped to 89%. By April 2022, compliance was down to 63%.  \nb.  In FY2017, DCS timely performed a CANS assessment in 99% of cases. \nBy FY2022, the rate of timely assessments had fallen by 17%. \nc.  In FY 2017, DCS moved children an average of 6.6 times per 1,000 days. \nBy FY 2023, this had ballooned to 10.1 moves per 1,000 days. \nd.  In a March 2017 report, 97%-100% of children with a goal of reunification \nhad at least one face-to-face visit with a parent of at least one hour. DCS \nabandoned this metric almost immediately; from July 2017 to June 2018, \nthis metric dropped to 56%. By early 2024, foster children’s visitation with \nparents and siblings in foster care was rated as adequate in only 46% of \ncases. \n \n \nXIII.  Actual Justiciable Controversy as to Which Plaintiffs Have a Stake in the Outcome  \n  \n251.  Based  upon  the  foregoing,  an  actual  controversy  exists  between  the  parties \nregarding the following issues of fact:  \na.  Defendants’ actions and inactions maintain a system that fails to provide \nPlaintiffs with safe, secure, and appropriate foster care placements; fails to \nprovide and implement permanency plans; fails to provide foster children \nwith necessary services; and fails to regularly evaluate foster children’s \nphysical and mental well-being.  \n60 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 60 of 74 PageID #: 60\n\n \nb.  Defendants’ actions and inactions constitute a policy, pattern, practice, or \ncustom of deliberate indifference to the substantial and unreasonable risk of \nphysical, psychological, and emotional harm to children in DCS custody.  \nc.  Defendants’ practices are so deficient collectively that they re-inflict injury \non the abused and/or neglected Plaintiffs and amount to the deprivation of \nPlaintiffs’ rights while in government custody, including the right to be free \nfrom the infliction of unnecessary pain, the right to conditions and duration \nof foster care reasonably related to the purpose of government custody, the \nright to a permanent home and family, the right to treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose and assumptions of government custody, and \nthe right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable and unnecessary \nintrusions  into  their  emotional  well-being.  Defendants’  deprivation  of \nPlaintiffs’ rights while in government custody has given rise to an actual, \nexisting controversy between the parties. \n252.  Plaintiffs have a real stake in the outcome of this case, as their physical and mental \nhealth has been harmed, and remains at substantial and unreasonable risk of being further harmed, \nas a result of Defendants’ actions and inactions.  \n253.  Defendants retain the practical power to adversely affect Plaintiffs, as they are \nultimately or directly responsible for, and have ultimate or direct control over, whether DCS \nprovides constitutionally adequate services to the Plaintiffs herein and the putative classes of foster \nchildren they seek to represent. \n \n61 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 61 of 74 PageID #: 61\n\n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Substantive Due Process \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n254.  Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n255.   A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution to provide reasonable care to and protect from harm a child it has taken \ninto its foster care custody. \n256.   The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional judgment and \namounts to deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected liberty and privacy \ninterests. As a result, Plaintiffs have been and are at risk of being deprived of substantive due \nprocess  rights  conferred  upon  them  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n257.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to:  \na.  the right to freedom from maltreatment while in foster care;  \nb.  the  right  to  protection  from  unnecessary  intrusions  into  the  child’s \nemotional and psychological well-being while in government custody; \nc.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable and unnecessary \nintrusions into the child’s emotional and psychological well-being while in \ngovernment custody; \nd.  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the \npurpose of government custody;  \n62 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 62 of 74 PageID #: 62\n\n \ne.  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and assumptions \nof government custody; \nf.  the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary to \naccomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \ncustody; and \ng.  the right to receive a minimally adequate education. \n258.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and therefore are entitled to injunctive \nrelief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Right to Familial Association \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n259.  Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n260.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional judgment and \namounts to deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected liberty and privacy \ninterests. As a result, Plaintiffs have been and are at risk of being deprived of the right to a \npermanent home and family derived from the First Amendment right of association, the Ninth \nAmendment reservation of rights to the people, and the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due \nprocess protections. \n261.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and therefore are entitled to injunctive \nrelief. \n63 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 63 of 74 PageID #: 63\n\n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq. \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n262.   Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n263.   The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, or custom of depriving Plaintiffs of their rights under the Adoption Assistance and Child \nWelfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, to: \na.  placement in a foster placement that conforms to nationally recommended \nprofessional standards, 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10);  \nb.  a written case plan that includes a plan to provide safe, appropriate and \nstable foster care placements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A);  \nc.  a written case plan that ensures that the child receives safe and proper care \nwhile  in  foster  care  and  implementation  of  that  plan,  42  U.S.C.  §§ \n671(a)(16), 675(1)(B);  \nd.  a written case plan that ensures provision of services to parents, children \nand foster parents to facilitate reunification, or where that is not possible, \nthe permanent placement of the child and implementation of that plan, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B);  \ne.  a written case plan, where appropriate, that ensures the location of an \nadoptive or other permanent home for the child and implementation of that \nplan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(E); \n64 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 64 of 74 PageID #: 64\n\n \nf.  a written case plan that ensures the educational stability of the child while \nin foster care and implementation of that plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), \n675(1)(G);  \ng.  a case review system in which each child has a case plan designed to achieve \nsafe and appropriate foster care placements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), \n675(5)(A);  \nh.  a case review system in which the status of the child is reviewed no less \nfrequently than every six months by a court, or person responsible for case \nmanagement, for purposes of determining the safety of the child, continuing \nnecessity and appropriateness of the placement, extent of compliance with \nthe  permanency  plan  and  projected  date  of  permanency, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(C); and  \ni.  receive  quality  services  to  protect  each  child’s  safety  and  health, \n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22). \n264.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and therefore are entitled to injunctive \nrelief. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act \n(Asserted by the ADA Subclass Against Defendants) \n \n265.  Each of the foregoing paragraphs is hereby repeated and incorporated by reference \nas if fully set forth herein. \n266.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \nits enabling regulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.101 et seq., prohibit discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities. \n65 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 65 of 74 PageID #: 65\n\n \n267.  ADA  Subclass  Plaintiffs  have  behavioral,  developmental  and  psychiatric \ndisabilities, which qualify them as individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA, \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132(2),  and  “otherwise  qualified  individuals  with  a  disability”  under  the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). They meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of foster care services provided by DCS. \n268.  Defendants are public entities, or public officials of a public entity, subject to the \nprovisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132(1)(A). Such entities also receive federal financial \nassistance and are thus subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b); \n34 C.F.R. 104.51.  \n269.  Title II of the ADA prohibits a public entity from excluding a person with a \ndisability from participating in, or denying the benefits of, the goods, services, programs and \nactivities of the entity or otherwise discriminating against a person on the basis of his or her \ndisability. \n270.  Likewise,  the  Rehabilitation  Act  and  its  enabling  regulations  prohibit \ndiscrimination in the provision of services by any entity receiving federal funding. 34 C.F.R. \n104.4(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2); 34 C.F.R. 104.52(a)(2). \n271.  Under the regulations enforcing the ADA, the state may not “[p]rovide a qualified \nindividual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of \nachievement as that provided to others . . . .” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii). \n272.  Accordingly, DCS must provide children with disabilities an equal opportunity to \naccess foster care services and educational services, in the least restrictive appropriate setting, as \nit provides children without disabilities in its custody. \n66 \nCase 3:25-cv-00566     Document 1     Filed 05/19/25     Page 66 of 74 PageID #: 66\n\n \n273.  Moreover, Defendants have an affirmative duty to “make reasonable modifications \nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \nwould  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the  service,  program,  or  activity.” \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). \n274.  As set forth above, the regulatory hallmark and guiding force of disability law is \nthe provision of services, including the child’s placement in the most integrated environment \nappropriate to the youth’s needs. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(b)(2); see also \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999). \n275.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violations of Title II of the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiffs have been or are at risk of being placed in overly restrictive \nsettings, being deprived of education, and being subjected to unnecessary trauma because of their \ndisabilities, as set forth above, and will continue to suffer injury until Defendants are required to, \nand have, come into compliance with the requirements of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. \n(Against all Defendants) \n \n276.
