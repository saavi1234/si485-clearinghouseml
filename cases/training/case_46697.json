          "description": "Minute Order by Judge Jinsook Ohta: On June 13, 2025, Petitioner filed a motion requesting to extend the Court's 12:00 P.M., June 13, 2025 deadline to file motions for temporary restraining order and class certification. Dkt. 37 . The Court finds good cause does not exist to extend this deadline as the request was filed after Petitioner's counsel already failed to meet the Court's deadline - a deadline that the Court already continued after counsel's first failure to obey the Court's prior June 11, 2025 deadline for these motions. See Dkts. 22, 35. Thus, the Court DENIES this request and orders Petitioner to file (1) a motion for temporary restraining order addressing why there is good cause for extension of the current temporary restraining order under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65(b)(2) and (2) a motion for provisional class certification by 11:59 P.M., Friday, June 13, 2025.The Court further clarifies that independent of any forthcoming TRO motion and class certification motion, Respondents are required to file a response addressing the issues identified in the Court's June 9, 2025 order, Dkt. 22, by 9:00 A.M. Monday, June 16, 2025.These deadlines will remain unless the parties stipulate to extend the Court's order granting temporary relief, Dkt. 2, past the initial 14 day period provided by Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b). Signed by Judge Jinsook Ohta on 6/13/2025.(kxh) (Entered: 06/13/2025)"

Dkt. 73. For the reasons stated on the record, the Court declines to convert the limited TRO into a preliminary injunction at this time. However, the Court has not ruled on the merits of class certification, Petitioner's underlying habeas petition, nor the merits of the requests for broader injunctive and declaratory relief. The Court directs the parties to submit status reports by August 1, 2025, regarding: 1) the status of Petitioner's work authorization (EAD); 2) potential issues with the one-year asylum filing deadline; and 3) Petitioner's conditions of release. In addition, the Court directs Petitioner's counsel to file a status report by the same date regarding her efforts to bring in co-counsel. Signed by Judge Jinsook Ohta on July 3, 2025.

The Court orders Petitioner to submit the following by 5:00 P.M., Wednesday, June 11, 2025: (1) an amended petition that includes the background facts detailing Petitioner's regular removal proceedings (initiation, release on bond, status of proceedings at the time of detention, and dismissal) as stated by counsel on the record at this status conference, and all of his claims and their bases; (2) a motion for temporary restraining order addressing why there is good cause for extension of the current temporary restraining order under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65(b)(2); (3) a motion for provisional class certification; and (4) an update on the status of co-counsel. If Petitioner intends to proceed with a claim for denial of access to counsel, in addition to what appears to be his due process and APA claims stemming from being diverted from regular removal proceeding to expedited removal proceedings, he is to amend his petition accordingly to include the facts alluded to by counsel surrounding such denial by Respondent Core Civic at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. The Court orders Respondents to respond to the above by 5:00 P.M., Friday, June 13, 2025. Respondents' brief in response shall also provide additional information regarding its practice within the Southern District of California of dismissing proceedings under Section 240 of the INA, detaining these asylum seekers, and initiating removal proceedings under Section 235, including whether this practice applies to or is directed toward all asylum seekers who appear in immigration court for removal proceedings. If this practice or policy is only directed towards some asylum seekers who have individual merits hearings scheduled in immigration court, Respondents are ordered to describe the criteria used to determine which of these asylum seekers are subject to termination of INA 240 proceedings and initiation of expedited removal proceedings.Both parties are also ordered to supplement the factual record with the Notice to Appear originally issued to Petitioner, the order dismissing Petitioner's immigration case on June 3, 2025, and the warrant issued for Petitioner, as well as any additional documents in his immigration case relevant to the petition. The Court will hold the hearing on the requests for temporary restraining order and provisional class certification at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 18, 2025 in Courtroom 4C before Judge Jinsook Ohta.

The Court requests that the Government specifically address the following issues in its briefing due 5:00 p.m. Friday, June 13, 2025. First, whether termination of removal proceedings under INA § 240 to place a petitioner who already has their individual merits hearing scheduled into expedited removal proceedings under INA § 235(b)(1) violates due process, their statutory right to apply for asylum, or the APA. Second, whether an agency can unilaterally detain a petitioner who was already granted bond by an immigration judge by terminating their underlying proceedings and initiating expedited removal proceedings. See Gunaydn v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01151, 2025 WL 1459154 (D. Minn. May 21, 2025); see also Ozturk v. Hyde, 136 F.4th 382, 397-8 (2d Cir. 2025).

          "description": "Minute Order by Judge Jinsook Ohta: On June 24, 2025, Respondents moved to 1) vacate the evidentiary hearing set for June 30, 2025; 2) extend the briefing schedule for the preliminary injunction hearing set for July 2, 2025; and 3) to vacate the temporary restraining order enjoining Respondents from removing Petitioner from the district or country before the conclusion of his pending proceedings. Dkt. 57 . The Court finds that the government has shown good cause to 1) temporarily vacate the evidentiary hearing set for June 30, 2025 and 2) modify the current preliminary injunction briefing and hearing schedule as set forth below. Thus, the Court VACATES the June 30, 2025 hearing.While the preliminary injunction hearing set for July 2, 2025, will remain on calendar, the Court will limit the briefing and oral argument for that hearing only as to the likelihood of irreparable harm absent an injunction to enjoin the removal of Petitioner. Based on the outcome of this hearing, the Court will decide the appropriate timing for proceeding with the remainder of the preliminary injunction issues raised before the Court. This limited briefing from Respondents is due by 12:00 p.m. on June 29, 2025. Petitioner may respond by 12:00 p.m. on Monday, June 30, 2025.However, the Court denies Respondents' motion to vacate the existing temporary restraining order. \"Modification [or vacatur] of an injunction is proper only when there has been a change of circumstances.... that would render continuance of the injunction in its original form inequitable.\" Favia v. Indiana University of Pennsylvania, 7 F.3d 332, 337 (3d Cir. 1993 (emphasis added). Given Respondents' representations that they will not remove Petitioner until the resolution of his pending proceedings, Dkt. 57 at 4, Respondents have not shown how continuance of the restraining order is inequitable to or harms the government. Cf. Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. v. Grunwald, 400 F.3d 1119, 1124 (9th Cir. 2005) (\"a motion to modify a preliminary injunction is meant only to relieve inequities that arise after the original order\").

          "description": "Minute Order by Judge Jinsook Ohta: Petitioner filed a motion seeking to seal portions of exhibits filed in support of his June 14, 2025 motion for temporary restraining order (Dkt. 41), opposition to Respondents' motion to vacate the Court's June 20, 2025 temporary restraining order (Dkt. 62), and reply in support of Petitioner's motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. 67). Dkt. 68 . Along with this motion, Petitioner filed proposed versions of these exhibits with redactions to the portions he wishes to seal, Dkts. 42, 62-2, and 67-1, and an unredacted version of all these exhibits, Dkt. 70. Because the exhibits Petitioner seeks to seal were filed in support of his motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction motion, the Court concludes that these discrete portions of the exhibits meet the compelling reasons standard for sealing. Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Chrysler Grp., LLC, 809 F.3d 1092, 1102 (9th Cir. 2016) (holding that because a preliminary injunction motion was more than tangentially related to the merits of the case, the district court was required to consider the documents under the compelling reasons standard). The redacted information contains Petitioner's medical records, Petitioner's personal identifying information, and the names and phone numbers for third-parties involved in humanitarian work where the disclosure of this data may expose the information to improper purposes. Kamakana v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir. 2006) (Compelling reasons exist when \"court files might have become a vehicle for improper purposes, such as the use of records to gratify private spite, promote public scandal, circulate libelous statements, or release trade secrets.\") (internal citations and quotations omitted).Thus, the Court GRANTS the motion to seal. Dkt. 68. The Court directs the Clerk of Court to (1) publicly file the redacted exhibits at Dkts. 42, 62-2, and 67-1, and (2) seal the unredacted exhibits filed in support of Petitioner's motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction at Dkt. 70.

Dkt. 102. District courts have broad discretion to stay proceedings. Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997). In determining whether a stay is warranted, the Court considers (1) potential damage to the nonmoving party; (2) hardship to the moving party if the stay is denied; and (3) whether the stay would simplify issues or promote judicial economy. CMAX, Inc. v. Hall, 300 F.2d 265, 268 (9th Cir. 1962). Here, the parties jointly seek a stay pending resolution of their September 24, 2025 motion in immigration court to correct Plaintiff's employment authorization document (\"EAD\") clock. The Court finds that this correction may moot in part Plaintiff's habeas claims and affect the relief sought for claims related to Plaintiff's prior detention, thus simplifying the issues before this Court. Further, Plaintiff is no longer detained, reducing potential prejudice from a stay, and denying the stay could cause unnecessary motion practice and hardship while the immigration court considers the EAD motion. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the joint motion to stay and VACATES Defendants' October 10, 2025 deadline to respond to the Fourth Amended Complaint [Dkt. 102]. The parties are ORDERED to file a joint status report by October 31, 2025 regarding the status of the immigration court's ruling on their joint motion to correct Plaintiff's EAD clock.

          "description": "Minute Order by Judge Jinsook Ohta: Petitioner A.M. filed a motion requesting to proceed via a pseudonym. Dkt.5. Specifically, Petitioner seeks to (1) seal the first page of his habeas corpus petition, which is currently only accessible to the Court and case participants, as it inadvertently included identifying information and (2) proceed in this litigation with the initials \"A.M.\" Id. at 2.The Court finds Petitioner has demonstrated this is an \"unusual case\" where nondisclosure of the party's identity \"is necessary... to protect a person from harassment, injury, ridicule or personal embarrassment.\" Does I Thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-68 (9th Cir. 2000) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Doe, 655 F.2d 920, 922 n.1 (9th Cir. 1981)). Where a party seeks to proceed pseudonymously on the basis of retaliatory harm, \"a district court must balance five factors: '(1) the severity of the threatened harm, (2) the reasonableness of the anonymous party's fears,... (3) the anonymous party's vulnerability to such retaliation,' (4) the prejudice to the opposing party, and (5) the public interest.\" Doe v. Kamehameha Schs./Bernice Pauahi Bishop Est., 596 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir. 2010).Here, the balance of factors weighs in favor of Petitioner proceeding pseudonymously considering his safety concerns as Sahrawi man seeking asylum in this country. Petitioner alleges that that he was arrested outside the immigration court located on 880 Front Street on June 3, 2025 and is at imminent risk of being deported to Morocco where he has faced persecution and torture. Dkt. 1, par. 1, 3-4, 19, 23. Petitioner's concerns for his safety--that he faces persecution or death--if deported are amplified if his identifying information were to be disclosed to the public and Moroccan authorities knew he sought asylum. Dkt. 5; Kamehameha Schools, 596 F.3d at 1043 (Threats of physical harm \"present[ ] the paradigmatic case for allowing anonymity.\"). The Ninth Circuit and district courts have recognized retaliation from a foreign government as a sufficient basis to proceed anonymously. Does I thru XXIII, 214 F.3d at 1063 (considering possible retaliation by the Chinese government against Chinese national plaintiffs residing in Saipan and their family members residing in China as supporting the use of pseudonyms); Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. Nielsen, No. 17-CV-02366-BAS-KSC, 2017 WL 6541446, at *8 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2017) (granting plaintiffs' requests to proceed pseudonymously considering their identity is not central to the legal merits of their asylum claim).Based on the Court's review of the severity of the harm, the reasonableness of the Petitioner's proffered fears, and the Petitioner's vulnerability to retaliation, the Court finds that the need for anonymity in this case outweighs countervailing considerations of potential prejudice to Respondents. See Kamehameha Schools, 596 F.3d at 1042. The Court also finds that revealing the identity of Petitioner would not advance the public's understanding of these legal proceedings. For the same reasons, the Court finds the compelling reasons standards to seal the first page of Petitioner's complaint has been demonstrated. Kamakana v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir. 2006); see Poozesh v. Pompeo, No. 119CV01466LJOSKO, 2019 WL 6052363, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 15, 2019) (granting the sealing of pleadings containing asylum seeking plaintiffs' identifying information considering plaintiffs showed that the potential retaliation from the Iranian government was severe, plaintiffs' fear of retaliation was reasonable, and they were vulnerable to such retaliation if their identities were made public).The Court GRANTS Petitioner's sealing motion and request to proceed pseudonymously [Dkt. 5 ]. Petitioner shall submit an amended complaint that is identical to his initial complaint, except that it only identifies Petitioner as \"A.M.\" The Clerk of Court shall seal Petitioner's initial complaint.

    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the federal government&rsquo;s alleged use of expedited removal proceedings against noncitizens arrested at federal courthouses in San Diego, without due process or access to counsel. On June 4, 2025, a Moroccan national who identifies as Western Sahrawi filed this class-action habeas corpus petition and civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Represented by private immigration counsel, The plaintiff sought relief on behalf of himself and a putative class of similarly situated noncitizens. The plaintiff named Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its officials, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its secretary, and other federal officials as defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Jinsook Ohta and Judge Allison H. Goddard.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff alleged that On June 3, 2025, ICE officers arrested him at the Edward J. Schwartz U.S. Courthouse in San Diego, after appearing for what he understood to be an asylum merits hearing. DHS then sought and obtained dismissal of the plaintiff&rsquo;s &sect; 1229a removal case before the immigration judge and immediately re-detained him under expedited removal authority pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1225(b)(1). The plaintiff claimed that this &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; from full removal to expedited removal deprived him of access to the immigration court, violated statutory protections under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and interfered with his ability to seek asylum and consult counsel. He further alleged that ICE was carrying out a broader pattern of &ldquo;courthouse arrests and summary removals&rdquo; under color of the Alien Enemies Act, targeting individuals of Arab or Muslim descent.</p>\r\n<p>The same day the complaint was filed, the court issued an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO) and scheduled a preliminary injunction (PI) hearing. The government opposed on jurisdictional grounds, asserting that the plaintiff was lawfully placed in expedited removal proceedings and that judicial review was barred under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252. The government submitted declarations showing that the plaintiff was detained without a final order of removal and had already been referred for a credible fear interview under &sect; 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). Officials also maintained that the San Diego Field Office was not enforcing removal under the Alien Enemies Act and had no policy of arresting respondents at court hearings.</p>\r\n<p>On June 13, the plaintiff filed a third amended petition and renewed his request for class wide emergency relief. He moved to certify a class of all individuals arrested at courthouses within the Southern District of California and allegedly rerouted into expedited removal proceedings without a judicial warrant, bond hearing, or access to legal consultation with interpretation. The government again opposed, arguing that the plaintiff had not satisfied Rule 23 standards and that he lacked standing to represent such a class.</p>\r\n<p>On June 18, 2025, the Court extended the temporary restraining order, and ordered the plaintiff to amend his Third Amended complaint to reflect that he is requesting (1) immediate release from custody, &ldquo;(2) a declaration that the purported practice and policy of terminating standard removal proceedings and detaining noncitizens at the San Diego Immigration Court is unlawful; (3) an order enjoining his transfer out of this district pending resolution of these proceedings; and (4) and an order enjoining the practice of detaining individuals in and around immigration courtrooms, federal courtrooms, and state courtrooms.&rdquo; The plaintiff issued a new Amended Complaint Third on June 20, and a motion for preliminary injunction on June 25 consistent with the Court&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff was released from detention on June 19, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 3, 2025 after a hearing on July 2, the Court declined to convert the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction. The Court did not rule on the merits of class certification, the plaintiff's claims, or requests for broader injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 19, 2025, the plaintiff filed a Fourth Amended complaint, which included claims that related to his recent release. In particular, the plaintiff sought protection from the collateral consequences of &ldquo;the abusive, overly broad, and harassing practice of using the courthouses to conduct civil courthouse arrests without a bench warrant, impose indefinite &lsquo;mandatory&rsquo; detention, and forced removal without due process as asylum seekers and other noncitizens lawfully appear for their mandated courtroom appearances.&rdquo; The plaintiff indicated that since his release, defendants have been requiring him to do in person check-ins, telemonitoring, and home visits, and had placed GPS restrictions on him, thereby depriving his liberty. The plaintiff asked that the Court issue a writ of habeas corpus and the continued relief for Petitioner and order the defendants to refrain from any further unlawful detention of the plaintiff at courthouse facilities or other locations without proper legal authority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 6, 2025, the Court stayed proceedings pursuant to a joint motion filed October 3. The parties jointly sought the stay pending resolution of a motion in immigration court to correct the plaintiff&rsquo;s employment authorization document. The Court found that the results of the immigration court&rsquo;s decision may render part of the plaintiff&rsquo;s habeas claims and claims for relief moot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of October 9, 2025, proceedings are stayed pending the immigration court&rsquo;s decision.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case is about a Moroccan national who said he was treated unfairly by U.S. immigration officers after being arrested at a San Diego federal courthouse in June 2025. He claimed he was supposed to have a regular immigration hearing, but instead was suddenly put into an “expedited removal” process—which meant he lost many due process rights, like seeing a judge, getting legal help, or having a bond hearing. He also said this was part of a larger pattern where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targets Arab or Muslim people for quick deportations at courthouses.\r\n\r\nHe, along with other noncitizens in similar situations, filed a lawsuit against ICE, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other officials. He asked the court to order his release and to stop the government from continuing courthouse arrests without proper legal process. The judge issued a temporary order to halt his removal and scheduled more hearings.\r\n\r\nThe government argued that they followed the law and that the court didn’t have the power to make decisions in this type of case. As things continued, the plaintiff was released from detention but claimed he still faced unfair supervision, such as GPS tracking and frequent check-ins.\r\n\r\nOn October 6, 2025, the court paused the case while the immigration court reviews his work permit issue, which could settle some of his claims. For now, the case is on hold and still ongoing, waiting for the next decision.",

Petitioner-Plaintiff Asylum seeker A.M. is a 34-year-old Western Sahara \n8 \n(“Sahrawi”) man, who fled for his life from Western Sahara, a United Nations’ \n9 \nrecognized non-self-governing, occupied territory by Morocco. He alleges being \n10 \nsubjected to an unlawful detention and the continuous deprivation of his rights, \n11 \nwhile seeking humanitarian protection and pursuing his asylum claims at court and \n12 \ndetained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County.  \n13 \n2.  He  submits  this  habeas  corpus  petition  under  28  U.S.C.  §2241  for  a \n14 \njudicial  check  on  Respondents’  administrative  decisions  and  procedural \n15 \ndeprivations to detain him and the collateral consequences under 8 U.S.C.§ \n16 \n1225(b)(1),  INA  §  235(b)(1),  and  then  initiate  expedited  removal  proceedings \n17 \nagainst him under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A), INA § 235(b)(1)(A), despite lacking \n18 \nsuch authority because A.M. was—and still is—in pending removal proceedings \n19 \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, INA § 240, and A.M. does not satisfy either threshold \n20 \ninadmissibility ground for expedited removal proceedings. There was no final \n21 \norder of removal nor were Respondents lawfully in place under any exigency to \n22 \ndeprive him of his liberty or freedom of movement.  \n23 \n3.  And  because  the  government  still  purports  to  hold  him  with  continued \n24 \ncustodial  monitoring  and  deprivation  conditions  under  §1225(b)(1)  expedited \n25 \nremoval proceedings, it has not provided him with an individualized bond hearing \n26 \nto challenge his detention and on-going legal and physical custody, under 8 U.S.C. \n27 \n§  1226(a),  INA  §  236(a),  contravening  his  rights  under  the  Immigration  and \n28 \n   1                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1252     Page 3\nof 38\n \n \n1  Nationality Act and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n2  4.  On or about January 29, 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers \n3  apprehended A.M. near San Ysidro, California, after he had already effected an \n4  entry into the United States.  See Exhibit A, Notice to Appear.  He claimed a \n5  fear of persecution rather than apply for admission, and the officers consciously \n6  selected to place him in removal proceedings with due process protections under 8 \n7  U.S.C. § 1229(a), INA § 240. \n5.  Despite Petitioner’s proper and lawful appearance for more than one year \n8 \nand half, on June 3, 2025, the government moved an immigration court judge to \n9 \nthe proceedings that had been scheduled as an individual merits hearing, stating it \n10 \nwould be quicker to remove applicants from the country way without notice or an \n11 \nopportunity to be heard, as a matter of the new administration’s policy; U.S. \n12 \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested and detained A.M., \n13 \npurportedly under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1), INA § 235(b)(1).  \n14 \n6.  The immigration judge stated that Petitioner had “a right to seek his asylum \n15 \nclaim, just not in immigration court”.   \n16 \n7.  Though the government knew that A.M. was and is represented because  \n17 \nthey  whisked  him  away  from  court,  had  the  Notice  of  Entry  of  Appearance, \n18 \nreceived an updated G-28 that day, confirmed having the correct information, and \n19 \nPetitioner  had  requested  his  attorney,  A.M.  is  informed  and  believes  the \n20 \ngovernment did not provide him his counsel, in spite of interrogations, scheduled \n21 \ncourt hearings, and agency actions.  \n22 \n8.  Plaintiff-Petitioner believes he was told to sign away his rights on or about  \n23 \nJune 3, 2025, outside of counsel, did not sign or was deprived of a translator or \n24 \ncounsel, and then told he must be fingerprinted and interrogated all outside of the \n25 \npresence of counsel or a translator of the writings.  \n26 \n9.  ICE detained A.M. and then issued him two new Notices to Appear on or \n27 \nabout June 16, 2025.  A.M. timely appealed the IJ’s order granting that motion, \n28 \n   2                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1253     Page 4\nof 38\n \n \n1  meaning that the IJ’s order was – and is – not final, and those proceedings \n2  remained – and are still –pending.  Thus, ICE had no authority to detain him \n3  under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1), INA §235(B)(1), and assert expedited removal.  \n4  A.M. lacks the threshold inadmissibility necessary for expedited removal, which is \n5  available only for those inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. §§1182(a)(6)(C) or (a)(7), \n6  INA §§212(a)(6)(C), (a)(7).  \n7  10.  Absent review in this Court, no other neutral adjudicator will examine  \nA.M.’s plight: Respondents continue --- unchecked --- to place custodial \n8 \nrestrictions on him, place him back in custody.  He thus urges this Court to review \n9 \nthe lawfulness of his initial detention and collateral and on-going custodial \n10 \nconsequences; declare that his detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1), INA § \n11 \n235(b)(1), is unlawful; order either his continued release or that Respondents \n12 \nprovide him with a bond hearing complying with the procedural requirements in \n13 \nSingh v. Holder, 638 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2011); and, at a minimum, order the \n14 \ngovernment to restore his pre-detention status (including his release on his \n15 \nown recognizance, reinstated asylum clock-eligibility for a work permit, and \n16 \nstopping Respondents’ and their agents’ ongoing control and deprivation of \n17 \nhis liberty with house inspections, telemonitoring, in person check-ins, \n18 \nreporting requirements, and physical tracking.  A.M. was in Respondents’ \n19 \nlegal and physical custody at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, \n20 \nCalifornia.  As set forth herein, as the statutory and judicial interpretation of \n21 \n“custody” encompasses a broad range of restraints on liberty, Petitioner-Plaintiff \n22 \nrequests relief from the oppressive conditions that are tantamount to being in \n23 \nongoing legal and physical custody. \n24 \nEXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES \n25 \n  Plaintiff-Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies and no further \n26 \nones are available.   \n27 \n/// \n28 \n   3                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1254     Page 5\nof 38\n \n \n1  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2  11.  This action arises under the United States Constitution and the Immigration \n3  and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1101 et seq. INA §101 et seq. to challenge A.M.’s \n4  detention under the INA and any inherent or plenary power the government may \n5  claim to continue to impose restrictions on him.  \n6  12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 et seq.  \n7  (habeas corpus), as protected under Art. I, § 9, cl. 2 of the U.S. Constitution \n(Suspension Clause), 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (United States as defendant), 28 U.S.C. § \n8 \n1361 (mandamus), and 28 U.S.C. §1651 (All Writs Act).  A.M. is presently still \n9 \nunder Respondents’ legal and physical custody under the United States’ color of \n10 \nauthority, and this custody violates the U.S. Constitution, laws, or treaties. Its \n11 \njurisdiction is not limited by a petitioner’s nationality, status as an immigrant, or \n12 \nany other classification. See Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 747 (2008).  \n13 \n13.  This Court has original jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Federal  \n14 \njurisdiction  exists  under  28  U.S.C.  §1331  (federal  question).  This  court  has \n15 \nsupplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’ claims arising under state law pursuant to \n16 \n28 U.S.C.§ 1367 (a) because those claims are so related to the federal claims that \n17 \nthey form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United \n18 \nStates Constitution.   \n19 \n14.  This case arises under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Fourteenth Amendments to  \n20 \nthe United States Constitution, federal asylum statutes, the Administrative \n21 \nProcedure Act.  the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et \n22 \nseq. and its regs.; the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), see Foreign Affairs \n23 \nReform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, \n24 \nTitle XXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified as Note to 8 U.S.C. \n25 \n§ 1231).   \n26 \n15.  An actual and justiciable controversy exists between the parties under 28  \n27 \nU.S.C. § 2201. The Court has additional remedial authority under the All Writs \n28 \n   4                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1255     Page 6\nof 38\n \n \n1  Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. The Court may grant relief pursuant to; 28 U.S.C. § 2243; \n2  the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq. and the Court’s inherent \n3  equitable powers.   \n4  16.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \n5  §1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the  events, acts, or omissions giving rise \n6  to the claims occurred in the County of San Diego including at the time of filing \n7  Petitioner  is  detained  in  the  Respondents’  custody,  in  the  Southern  District  of \nCalifornia; Respondents JASON AGUILAR, Chief Counsel for Immigration and \n8 \nCustoms Enforcement San Diego, SIDNEY AKI, Director of Field Operations, San \n9 \nDiego  Field  Office  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  GREGORY  J. \n10 \nARCHAMBEAULT,  are  believed  to  reside  in  this  district;  Respondents  are \n11 \nagencies or officers of the United States in their official capacity.    \n12 \nPARTIES \n13 \nA. Petitioner-Plaintiff (“Petitioner”)  \n14 \n17.  Plaintiff-Petitioner is a 34-year-old Western Sahrawi man who has been a  \n15 \nhuman  rights  Defender  at  an  internationally  well-respected  non-governmental \n16 \norganization that has presented to the United Nations and European Commission of \n17 \nHuman Rights. He fled that country because he suffered past persecution and fears \n18 \nfuture persecution there.   He arrived in the United States on or about January 29, \n19 \n2024, to seek asylum.  \n20 \n18.  A.M. is diabetic and has medical complications due to past persecution and  \n21 \nrequires access to daily medications and consistent medical care.   \n22 \n19.  The U.S. government has publicly stated that those with asylum claims  \n23 \nwould proceed with their credible fear and asylum rights as a matter of law.   \n24 \n20.  However, after lawfully presenting himself for his asylum hearing, he was  \n25 \narrested at the downtown Courthouse on June 3, 2025.     \n26 \n21.  Respondents had Petitioner’s attorneys contact because he was yanked  \n27 \naway from his hearing.  Petitioner provided Respondents with his G-28 Notice of \n28 \n   5                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1256     Page 7\nof 38\n \n \n1  Entry of Appearance as an Attorney in an abundance of Caution.  \n2  22.  Plaintiff-Petitioner’s legal representation endeavored to connect with him.   \n3  Initially he could not be found in the system; the following day he could not be \n4  found and was being processed”.  Subsequently, Plaintiff’s Counsel reached out to \n5  his ICE Officer, CORE CIVIC, INC. and by and through Respondents’ Counsel.  \n6  To date, Counsel has not been able to speak with him similar to the admonitions \n7  about those Petitioner who are unrepresented cannot access counsel. \n23.  Plaintiff have seen immigration officers waiting in court presumably to  \n8 \narrest him/her at prior court appearances if the case had concluded and believes \n9 \nthat  he/she  and/or  their  witnesses  face  likely  civil  immigration  arrest  in  court \n10 \nfollowing conclusion of the hearing.   \n11 \n24.  There is overwhelming medical evidence that the incarceration of a person  \n12 \nwill have a negative impact on their well-being especially where there are other \n13 \ntraumatic factors at work, and that damage can be permanent.    \n14 \nB.

On or about January 29, 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”)  \n14 \nofficers apprehended A.M. in or about San Ysidro Port of Entry, after he had \n15 \nalready  effected  an  entry  into  the  United  States.  A.M.  entered  and  presented \n16 \nhimself to seek asylum and claim a fear of persecution on or about January 30, \n17 \n2024.  \n18 \n41.  After a CBP officer briefly detained him, a supervisory officer representing \n19 \nthe government made a conscious decision to release him with a Notice to Appear \n20 \nunder  8  U.S.C.  1182(a)(6)(A)(i),  INA§212(a)(6)(A)(i)  of  the  Immigration  and \n21 \nNationality Act, as an ‘alien’ being present in the United States without being \n22 \nadmitted or paroled.   \n23 \n42.  The DHS officers released A.M. on his own recognizance.   \n24 \n43.  He was considered entry without inspection, not an arriving alien.  \n25 \n44.  In spring of 2024, an immigration judge at the Immigration Court in San  \n26 \nDiego granted A.M.’s request to appear in San Diego and file his I-589 application \n27 \nfor asylum.  \n28 \n   9                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1260     Page 11\nof 38\n \n \n1  45.  A.M. complied with the rules, notices, and appeared in court prepared  \n2  to present his lawful claim with I-589 filings in July of 2025, appeared in August, \n3  supplemented on October 15, 2024, further briefed the court on January 7, 2025, \n4  presented himself in February, and filed supporting evidence in the spring of 2025. \n5  46.  In February of 2025, his individual merits hearing was set for June. He  \n6  properly submitted his case prior to the fifteen (15) days under (8 C.F.R. § \n7  1003.31(c)). \n47.  In mid-May, he was prepared to present his asylum claims at his scheduled \n8 \nindividual merits hearing for June 3, 2025.       \n9 \n48.  A.M. was finally eligible to apply for work authorization with the  \n10 \nEmployment Authorization Document (EAD)(Form I-765); his asylum clock had \n11 \nbeen tolled for A.M. to seek representation and had fully prepared his case over the \n12 \ncourse  of  nearly  five  hundred  (500)  days.  See  Exhibit  B,  Employment \n13 \nAuthorization Document.  \n14 \n49.  Plaintiff-Petitioner’s witnesses were prepared to testify that day even in \n15 \nspite of recent hospitalization and unknown availability at a later date.  \n16 \n50.  At or about the end of May of 2025, Respondents started to show up at the \n17 \nimmigration courts at valid asylum hearings and arrest the applicants at their court \n18 \nhearings in San Diego, at or about 880 Front Street, Edward J. Schwartz Federal \n19 \nBuilding and U.S. Courthouse, and stating that they will remove those applicants \n20 \nwho are apprehended and withdrew the notice and opportunity to be heard.   \n21 \n51.  In an abundance of caution, due to the recent raids of witnesses and court  \n22 \nattendees, Petitioner re-submitted his witness list for a subsequent time with the \n23 \nwords  ‘Motion’  to  clarify  that  the  request  was  via  WebEx  or  telephonically.  \n24 \nPlaintiff-Petitioner  was  prepared  and  willing  to  testify  at  his  merits  hearing, \n25 \nindependent of those witnesses.  \n26 \n52.  On May 30, 2025, Petitioner is informed and believes the same day as a \n27 \nmemo ordered an increase in court dismissals, the court converted the trial into a \n28 \n   10                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1261     Page 12\nof 38\n \n \n1  master calendar hearing. See Exhibit C, memorandum to the Executive Office of \n2  Immigration Review (EOIR) Judges.  \n3  53.  Noticeably upon entry, the courthouse climate had changed. Petitioner is  \n4  informed and believes he could hear ICE agents by the door throughout the \n5  hearing.  Half a dozen men, covered in full face masks, were hovering by the \n6  courtroom doors. As Petitioner stepped outside of the doorway, Petitioner was \n7  summarily arrested within the Edward J. Schwartz building, and in spite of the \ncourt expressly stating A.M. has a lawful right to seek asylum, withholding of \n8 \nremoval, or convention against torture under the Immigration and Nationality Act.   \n9 \n54.  Even though the pretense for the change in the hearing was listing the \n10 \nwords ‘motion’ on an already filed document and all motions should have been \n11 \nfiled in mid-May, the court allowed the government to verbally move to dismiss \n12 \nthe case, without any notice and without an opportunity to be heard.  \n13 \n55.  Petitioner is informed that Respondents knew or should have known that \n14 \nthis deprivation of the notice and right to be heard was an overt intentional tactic \n15 \nand policy abuse to prevent the adjudication of a strong asylum claim and remove \n16 \nA.M. without due process forcing him into terrifying and ambiguous proceedings \n17 \nof immediate removal or indefinite detention when he had been fully compliant.   \n18 \n56.  Petitioner was told to sign away his rights on June 3, 2025, absent the \n19 \npresence of counsel.  See Exhibit D, Declined to Sign.  \n20 \n57.  Defendants  and  their  representatives  were  contacted  with  contact \n21 \ninformation and told not to interrogate Petitioner.    \n22 \n58.  Nonetheless, Petitioner was interrogated without the presence of counsel on \n23 \nJune 9, 2025.  \n24 \n59.  Thereafter, Petitioner was interrogated for a third time and told to sign and \n25 \nfingerprint a form on mandatory custodial requirements.  \n26 \n60.  Subsequent release from custody does not remove the court's jurisdiction \n27 \nover the habeas corpus petition.

In recent statements, behavior, and practice, Respondents-Defendants have  \n5  demonstrated little interest or regard for adhering to America’s foundational and \n6  bedrock  principles  of  due  process,  habeas  corpus,  and  rule  of  law.                                  \n7  Recently, on or about May 20, 2025, at his confirmation hearing, Respondent-\nDefendant  KRISTI  NOEM1  erroneously  responds:  \"Habeas  corpus  is  a \n8 \nconstitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this \n9 \ncountry”.  \n10 \n62.  Here, in San Diego, A.M. who presented himself lawfully for his asylum  \n11 \nhearing was separated from his attorney and upon is informed and believes, not \n12 \nclearly advised on why he is being detained or explained the process protecting his \n13 \nprocedural and substantive due process rights, after the United States government \n14 \nwithdrew his notice to appear in court to terminate his asylum case.  Respondents’ \n15 \nagents could not advise on the process, next steps or ensure protections. \n16 \n63.  He  is  seeking  asylum,  withholding  of  removal,  and  CAT  protections \n17 \nbecause he fears being killed arbitrarily imprisoned, beaten and tortured by the \n18 \nMoroccan police since they have already done so to him. A.M. was assaulted, \n19 \ntortured,  and  threatened  with  death  due  to  his  whistleblowing,  activism,  and \n20 \nrefusal  to  promote  the  Moroccan  government  on  a  national  stage  which \n21 \nconstitutes persecution on account of his political opinion. He is persecuted for \n22 \nhis Sahrawi race and ethnicity.

Upon  leaving  Petitioner's  June  3,  2025,  hearing,  Defendants  DHS/ICE \n3  agents arrested Petitioner and took him into custody. Declaration of A.M. As \n4  Petitioner left the immigration courtroom, he was detained by plainclothes ICE \n5  agents. No change of circumstances has occurred since Petitioner was released by \n6  CBP  on  or  January  30,  2024.    Petitioner  has  not  attempted  to  flee  and  has \n7  attended all scheduled court appearances.  \n65.  On June 4, 2025, with uncertainty and lack of clarity, A.M. petitioned this \n8 \ncourt for a writ of habeas corpus, a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, \n9 \nand emergency temporary restraining order (which this court granted), for fear of \n10 \nthose  in  immigration  custody  in  danger  of  imminent  removal  from  the  United \n11 \nStates (less than 24-hour notice) – and this court could potentially permanently \n12 \nlose jurisdiction. Petitioner fears the danger of the very same misconduct and being \n13 \ntransferred  outside  of  the  Southern  District  of  California  en  route  to  removal \n14 \nwithout a notice to appear, indefinite detention, and the lack of the opportunity to \n15 \nbe heard \n16 \n66.  As  a  part  of  an  official  memo,  Respondents,  including  leadership  and \n17 \nagents of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, planned to and did \n18 \narrest  noncitizens,  detaining  them  at  the  courthouse  without  notice  or  an \n19 \nopportunity to be heard, set for immediate expulsion from the United States at an \n20 \nunprecedented speed.   \n21 \n67.  Petitioner  respectfully  seeks  this  Court  protect  him  from  the  collateral \n22 \nconsequences of the abusive, overly broad, and harassing practice of using the \n23 \ncourthouses to conduct civil courthouse arrests without a bench warrant, impose \n24 \nindefinite  ‘mandatory’  detention,  and  forced  removal  without  due  process  as \n25 \nasylum  seekers  and  other  noncitizens  lawfully  appear  for  their  mandated \n26 \ncourtroom appearances.   \n27 \n68.

Despite widespread opposition to this practice, Respondents have not  \n2  only refused to stop it but has issued official policies authorizing civil courthouse \n3  arrests. DHS’s courthouse arrest policies, and its extensive practice of conducting \n4  civil arrests at asylum hearings, are unprecedented in United States history.   \n5  75.  At the same time, Respondents have prohibited that the use of Web Ex or  \n6  virtual appearances by Plaintiff-Petitioner and required that asylum seekers appear \n7  physically in person in the federal immigration court.  \n76.  Plaintiff is informed and believes Respondents are authorizing their  \n8 \nagents to be wearing Balaclava, full face covering masks, while hovering at or \n9 \nabout the courtroom doors.   \n10 \n77.  Curiously enough, the updated memo expressly provides, “ICE officers  \n11 \nshould generally avoid enforcement near non-criminal or specialized courts. \n12 \n78.  Petitioner-Plaintiff have complained of intimidating, aggressive arrests,  \n13 \nno notice, and chaotic scenes in which the public were refused entry or deterred \n14 \nfrom asserting their lawful rights in the federal building and courthouse: \n15 \n79.  In mid-May of 2025 Respondents’ commenced immigration raids at or  \n16 \nabout the Edward J. Schwartz Building.  \n17 \n80.

During this week Plaintiff is informed and believes another dozen of  \n4  applicants were detained at their asylum hearings via warrantless arrests and \n5  continue to be detained. \n6  85.  On or about June 9, 2025, Plaintiff is informed and believes a DOE  \n7  Supervisor stated an attorney must determine who would be detained of his two \nclients, it was irrelevant to him who was detained.  \n8 \n86.  On July 21, 2025, the immigration court told Petitioner he would have to \n9 \nrefile his previous asylum application.   \n10 \n87.  On August 2, 2025, Plaintiff was informed that he would have to restart the \n11 \nprocess from the beginning.  See Exhibit E, Asylum clock. \n12 \n88.  This directive to restart the asylum process has erased the time, costs, \n13 \nstress, and resources that Petitioner already spent pursuing his claim, postponing \n14 \nhis eligibility to obtain work authorization while awaiting the adjudication of his \n15 \nclaims.   \n16 \n89.  As a result of Respondents’ actions, Petitioner has suffered, and continues \n17 \nto suffer significant harm, including but not limited to prolonged inability to work, \n18 \npsychological distress, economic hardship, and uncertainty regarding his status to \n19 \nbe protected from persecution.  \n20 \n90.  DHS has made clear that anyone who is subject to arrest by DHS may be  \n21 \narrested in the courthouse, and courthouse arrests are not limited to defendants in \n22 \ncriminal matters – the arrests are of asylum seekers, witnesses, or anyone DHS \n23 \nbelieves is a “targeted alien…” who is or will be present at a specific location.”  \n24 \n91.  To be clear, Defendants- Respondents have already had Plaintiff in  \n25 \ncustody and processed their biometrics and backgrounds, including all information \n26 \nnecessary for civil immigration enforcement purposes. They have no interest or \n27 \n28 \n   17                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1268     Page 19\nof 38\n \n \n1  need in re-arrest for those reasons. Respondents’ only interest is to keep Plaintiff \n2  incarcerated or removed expeditiously from the country  \n3  92.  Plaintiff-Petitioner have established that his incarceration or on-going \n4  monitoring is not required for his immigration cases, as he reliably appeared for all \n5  court hearings.  \n6  Common Law and Constitutional protections \n7  93.  ICE practices are interfering with the public’s access to the federal building  \nand the courthouses. In addition to deviating from prior policy, the U.S. Supreme \n8 \nCourt long ago recognized a privilege against civil arrests for those attending \n9 \ncourt on official business—a privilege that traces its roots back to English \n10 \ncommon law and rests on the common-sense principle that the judicial system \n11 \ncannot function if parties and witnesses fear that their appearance in court \n12 \nwill be a trap. \n13 \n94.  DHS’s decision to flout the long-standing common-law privilege against  \n14 \ncivil courthouse arrests and to commandeer the courtrooms of the Southern District \n15 \nof California for federal civil immigration purposes has led Plaintiff-Petitioner(s) \n16 \nto reasonably fear civil arrest should they appear in court at their upcoming court \n17 \ndates.  \n18 \n95.  In addition to the Plaintiff- Petitioner’ own fear of civil arrest, the First,  \n19 \nFifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to receive equal protection and present \n20 \nwitnesses  and  to  a  public  trial  are  violated  because  the  policy  instills  fear  in \n21 \npotential witnesses and court observers who have reason to fear civil arrest at or \n22 \nabout the Edward J. Schwartz federal building and U.S. courthouse. \n23 \n96.  First, DHS’s courthouse arrest policies are arbitrary and capricious in  \n24 \nviolation of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) because the policies are \n25 \ninsufficiently explained, fail to consider all relevant factors, and depart from prior \n26 \npolicy  without  reasoned  explanation.  Further,  DHS’s  implementation  of  the \n27 \n28 \n   18                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1269     Page 20\nof 38\n \n \n1  policies is inconsistent. ICE’s policy states that arrests will take place “inside” the \n2  courthouses or at “non-public entrances and exits,” but arrests do not always take \n3  place inside the courthouse. For example, officers chased a client and his lawyer \n4  down  Broadway  Street  adjacent  to  the  courthouse  and  arrested  the  client.  The \n5  lawyer asked the officers to identify themselves and to produce a warrant, and the \n6  officers refused and further ordered the lawyer to back away under threat of arrest \n7  if he did not cooperate. ICE arrests outside of a courthouse are an arbitrary and \n8  capricious  application  of  its  policy.  See  e.g.,  Washington  v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of \n9  Homeland Sec., No. C19-2043 TSZ, 2020 WL 1819837, at *26–27 (W.D. Wash. \n10  Apr.  10,  2020)  (ICE’s  practice  of  arresting  immigrants  outside  courthouses, \n11  presents a plausible claim the policy is arbitrary and capricious under the APA). \n12  97.  Second, Congress never authorized DHS to conduct civil courthouse arrests  \n13  because  it  never  abrogated  the  longstanding  and  well-settled  common-law \n14  privilege  against  such  arrests.  The  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  the \n15  common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests is “well settled.” Stewart v. \n16  Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 129 (1916). When Congress acts in an area governed by \n17  “long-established and familiar” common-law principles, Congress is presumed to \n18  retain those principles. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534 (1993). Here, \n19  where Congress granted the federal government a general civil-arrest power to \n20  enforce  civil  immigration  laws,  Congress  retained  traditional  common-law \n21  limitations  on  that  arrest  power—including  that  such  arrests  cannot  be  made \n22  against parties and witnesses attending court on official business. Because the INA \n23  does not grant the federal government authority to conduct civil courthouse arrests \n24  in violation of the common-law privilege, DHS’s policies authorizing such arrests, \n25  and its policies to conduct such arrests, exceed DHS’s statutory authority and must \n26  be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n27  98.  Third, DHS’s policies violate the Constitutional right of access to the  \n28 \n   19                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1270     Page 21\nof 38\n \n \n1  courts,  which  prohibits  “systemic  official  action  [that]  frustrates  a  plaintiff  or \n2  plaintiff class in preparing and filing suits.” Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, \n3  413, 415 & n.12 (2002). Conditioning litigants’ ability to access the courts on \n4  risking  civil  arrest  creates  precisely  such  impermissible  frustration.  Indeed, \n5  common-law courts created the privilege against civil courthouse arrest to prevent \n6  the intolerable chilling effect of such arrests, explaining that the fear of arrest \n7  would “prevent [parties and witnesses’] approach,” obstructing “the administration \n8  of  justice.”  Halsey  v.  Stewart,  4  N.J.L.  366,  368  (N.J.  1817).  Plaintiff  found, \n9  however,  that  if  they  come  to  court  as  ordered  they  face  the  specter  of  civil \n10  courthouse arrest whether they win or lose their case.  \n11  99.  Fourth, DHS conducts the civil courthouse arrests without a judicial \n12  warrant authorizing the arrests as required by law. 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2). Pursuant \nto section 1357(a)(2), DHS must have “reason to believe” that the arrestee is \n13 \nviolating immigration law and that the arrestee is “likely to escape before a \n14 \nwarrant can be obtained. . . .” But Petitioner-Plaintiff consistent appearance at \n15 \ncourt demonstrates otherwise. DHS could have sought a warrant in the months \n16 \nwhile Plaintiff’ cases were pending.  DHS did not. Failure to obtain a warrant \n17 \nduring the pendency of the cases is the product of indolence, not necessity, and it \n18 \nviolates Petitioner-Plaintiff’ statutory and constitutional rights.  \n19 \nThe common-law privilege against civil arrest \n20 \n100. The common-law privilege against civil arrest while attending court on  \n21 \nofficial business is longstanding, tracing its origins back at least to the English \n22 \ncourts in the eighteenth century. \n23 \n101. In England, and in the early years of this country, civil arrest, or civil  \n24 \ncapias, was a common means for initiating civil proceedings. See Nathan Levy, Jr., \n25 \nMesne Process in Personal Actions at Common Law and the Power Doctrine, 78 \n26 \nYale L.J. 52, 61-70 (1968). The possibility that such civil arrests could take place \n27 \nin court, however, posed a significant problem for the judiciary: If a party or \n28 \n   20                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1271     Page 22\nof 38\n \n \n1  witness’s appearance in a case could be used as a trap for a civil arrest in another \n2  case, many parties and witnesses would not attend court. To avoid this problem, \n3  courts both in England and the United States—including the U.S. Supreme \n4  Court—recognized and strictly enforced an “inflexib[le]” privilege against the civil \n5  arrest of parties or witnesses attending court. Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. \n6  446, 448 (1923). As the Supreme Court explained, “the due administration of \n7  justice requires that a court shall not permit interference with the progress of a case \n8  pending before it, by the service of process in other suits, which would prevent, or \n9  the fear of which might tend to discourage, the voluntary attendance of those \n10  whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial administration in the \n11  pending litigation.” Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222, 225 (1932). \n12  102. DHS’s reinstated the previously enjoined practice of civilly arresting  \n13  people  in  the  federal  building  and  courthouses  of  the  Southern  District  of \n14  California  who  are  present  for  official  court  business  unduly  infringes  upon \n15  Plaintiff’ shared common-law right to be free from civil courthouse arrest: \n16  DHS officers are routinely present in the U.S. courthouses in the Southern \nDistrict of California to effectuate civil immigration arrests of Plaintiff \n17 \nwhen they appear in court for their asylum hearings \n18 \n103. Immigration agents are believed to have arrested scores of people and  \n19 \nplan to do so for even more in perhaps the hundreds or thousands inside  \n20 \nthe federal building and courthouses of the Southern District of California. \n21 \n104. Defendants- Respondents agents attend these hearings so they can  \n22 \neffectuate a civil courthouse arrest. That means ICE officers are present and poised \n23 \nto  conduct  administrative  arrests  at  every  immigration  hearing  in  the  Southern \n24 \nDistrict of California where the government requests dismissals.  \n25 \n105. When immigration officers attend the Plaintiff’ hearings, they patrol the  \n26 \nhallways and hover next to the exit of the courtroom at the time of the proceeding.  \n27 \n106. The officers are equipped with handcuffs and plan to effectuate a civil  \n28 \n   21                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1272     Page 23\nof 38\n \n \n1  arrest to place the defendant in immigration custody at the conclusion.  \n2  DHS officers conduct courthouse arrests without official warrants in or about \nthe U.S. Courthouses in the Southern District of California  \n3 \n107.  On information and belief, Plaintiff believe that DHS intends to effectuate  \n4 \nwarrantless immigration arrests of Plaintiff coming to court, while present at court, \n5 \nor leaving court in connection with their pending immigration cases, and there’s no \n6 \nguarantees for him.  \n7 \n108. If at all, Defendants-Respondents have deployed administrative signed  \n8  by staff, not court-ordered judicial warrants by a magistrate or federal judge.  \n9  109.  Plaintiff-Petitioner have been out of custody for months, are in  \n10  compliance with the conditions including attending all court hearings, and they do \n11  not present a risk of flight before DHS could obtain a warrant.  \n12 \nDHS’s civil courthouse arrest policies harm Plaintiff by forcing them to \n13  appear in court believing that they could be subjected to an unlawful civil \narrest in the courthouse at any time. \n14 \n110.  Plaintiff-Petitioner appear for their defensive asylum hearings. Plaintiff’-\n15 \nPetitioner’ decision on whether to testify at trial is chilled by the looming presence \n16 \nof  immigration  officers  in  court,  targets  certain  groups,  and  used  to  harass  or \n17 \nretaliate. Plaintiff fear that full exercise of their rights to present a defense could \n18 \nlead to the arrest of undocumented witnesses or members of the public who come \n19 \nto court to observe the proceedings. \n20 \nA. Asylum, Withholding of Removal, Convention Against Torture \n21 \n111. Plaintiff-Petitioner sought fairness, due process protection, and the rule  \n22 \nof law in the United States:   \n23 \n112. A.M. is still under the conditions of expedited removal despite  \n24 \nRespondents having knowledge of their claims for asylum and credible fear of \n25 \npersecution  the  Convention  against  Torture.  The  agency’s  refusal  to  provide  a \n26 \nmeaningful credible fear determination, arrest, resetting the clock, and detaining \n27 \nthe asylum seeker violates procedural due process and statutory rights under 8 \n28 \n   22                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1273     Page 24\nof 38\n \n \n1  U.S.C. § 1158 and § 1231(b)(3).  The restarting of proceedings is highly prejudicial \n2  and serves no legitimated government basis other than to harass, intimidate, delay, \n3  and increase taxpayers’ money especially as A.M. was scheduled for his asylum \n4  individual merits hearing on the day he was arrested.   \n5  113.  Plaintiff-Petitioner assert their rights to be free from civil arrest in this  \n6  Complaint. To be clear, Plaintiff do not argue that the Defendants-Respondents \n7  could not effectuate criminal arrests in the courthouse. Notably, DHS arrest of \nhim that merely place a person in immigration proceedings are civil arrests. \n8 \nSee I.N.S. v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1039 (1974) (holding that deportation \n9 \nproceedings are “purely” civil; administrative warrants do not confer the same \n10 \nauthority as a judicial warrant); Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 407 (2012) \n11 \n(holding that “it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present” in the \n12 \nUnited States and that deportation proceedings are civil).  \n13 \n114. DHS officers attend asylum and immigration hearings relating to whether  \n14 \nthey have experienced persecution, likely to be persecuted, eligible for asylum, \n15 \nwithholding of removal or and ready to civilly arrest Petitioner-Plaintiff once the \n16 \nhearings are pre-determined to be dismissed.  The anticipated arrests occur \n17 \nregardless of the veracity or strength of his claim - whether it be through a \n18 \nGovernment or Court’s granting the motion to dismiss– the officers are waiting to \n19 \neffectuate a warrantless civil arrest at or about the courtroom.  \n20 \n115. Petitioner is informed and believes this opaque and obfuscatory policy,  \n21 \nprocedure, and/or practice is denying credible claims to statutory protections, and \n22 \nsubjecting eligible applicants with colorable claims to persecution, torture, or death \n23 \nagainst United States and international law.  \n24 \nB. Custodial Detention from Expedited Removal Restrictions \n25 \n116. Defendants-Respondents’ refer to Section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n   23                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1274     Page 25\nof 38\n \n \n1  Nationality Act (INA), for the conditions of release of Petitioner and still maintain \n2  that alleged noncitizens subject to expedited removal be detained throughout the \n3  process, changing the rules for Petitioner here.  \n4  117. Expedited removal has applied to those who were in the country less than \n5  fourteen (14) days and within 100 miles of the border. 8 C.F.R. 2385.3(b) \n6  118. Specifically, this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 to \n7  review A.M.’s detention and the challenge to his placement in expedited \nremoval proceedings. Federal district courts possess broad authority to issue writs \n8 \nof habeas corpus when a person is held “in custody in violation of the Constitution \n9 \nor laws or treaties of the United States” (28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3)).  Unlike \n10 \nchallenges to the outcome of completed expedited removal proceedings, A.M.’s \n11 \nclaim that he was improperly subjected to expedited removal in the first instance \n12 \nfalls within the statutory exception permitting review of whether the noncitizen is \n13 \neligible for such review. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2), INA § 242(e)(2).  Because \n14 \nA.M. sought the habeas remedy of release from unlawful detention rather than \n15 \nfurther administrative review, his petition presents precisely the type of threshold \n16 \nlegality-of-detention question that §2241 was designed to address. See INS v. St. \n17 \nCyr, 533 U.S. 289, 301 (2001); see also Lopez-Marroquin v. Barr, 955 F.3d 759, \n18 \n759 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Singh, 638 F.3d at 1211-12)). And no court has ruled on \n19 \nthe legality of A.M.’s detention. \n20 \n119.  The government nowhere claims that § 1182(a)(6)(C) applies to A.M. And \n21 \nalthough he may be an “applicant for admission” under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a)(1), \n22 \nINA § 235(a)(1), he at no time made the predicate “application for admission” for \n23 \n§ 1182(a)(7)(A)(i) to apply to him. See Matter of Y-N-P-, 26 I. & N. Dec. 10, 13 \n24 \n(BIA  2012)  (“[B]eing  an  ‘applicant  for  admission’  under  section  235(a)(1)  is \n25 \ndistinguishable from ‘applying . . . for admission to the United States.’” (quoting \n26 \nPoveda v. United States AG, 692 F.3d 1168 (11th Cir. 2012))). \n27 \n120. Indeed, under the Ninth Circuit’s en banc holding in Torres v. Barr, \n28 \n   24                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1275     Page 26\nof 38\n \n \n1  976 F.3d 918 (9th Cir. 2020) (en banc), § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i), which applies “at the \n2  time of application for admission”—in contrast to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), \n3  INA § 212(a)(6)(A)(i) (applying to those “present in the United States without \n4  being admitted or paroled”)—cannot apply to A.M. because it applies only at “the \n5  time when a noncitizen seeks permission to physically enter United States \n6  territory.” Id. at 924. And when A.M. encountered the CBP officers, he had already \n7  effected an entry by crossing into the territorial limits of the United States, while \nactually and intentionally evading inspection at the nearest inspection point and \n8 \nfree from restraint. See, e.g., Matter of Pierre, 14 I. & N. Dec. 467, 468 (BIA \n9 \n1973) (describing the traditional entry test). \n10 \n121.  Nor does United States v. Gambino-Ruiz, 91 F.4th 981 (9th Cir. 2024), \n11 \npermit applying § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i) here. A.M.’s request for asylum did not \n12 \nconstitute an application for admission. See, e.g., Matter of V-X-, 26 I&N Dec. \n13 \n147, 152 (BIA 2013) (holding asylum is not an admission); id. at 151 n.3 (“8 CFR \n14 \n§ 1208.14(c) contemplates that an inspection for inadmissibility will occur only \n15 \n“[i]f the asylum officer A.M.s not grant asylum.”). \n16 \n122. Further, ICE itself elsewhere asserts that 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), INA \n17 \n236(a)—and not 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), INA § 235(b)—governs the arrest and \n18 \ndetention of noncitizens who entered without inspection and are later \n19 \napprehended in the interior. In documenting the arrest of such noncitizens, ICE \n20 \ntypically records that the person was arrested and detained under § 1226(a) \n21 \n(unless the person has committed an offense subjecting them to § 1226(c) \n22 \ndetention). \n23 \n123.  And for its part, the BIA recently published a precedent decision stating its  \n24 \nnew view that 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A), INA § 1225(b)(2)(A)—and not 8 U.S.C. \n25 \n§ 1225(b)(1), INA § 1225(b)(1)—governs the detention of those whom, like A.M., \n26 \nthe government encounters shortly after they enter the United States and places in \n27 \n28 \n   25                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1276     Page 27\nof 38\n \n \n1  removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, INA § 240, and that such statute \n2  controls “until certain proceedings have concluded.” See Matter \n3  of Q. L, 29 I. & N. Dec. 66, 69 (BIA 2025) (quoting Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 \n4  U.S. 281, 298 (2018)). Thus, even under the BIA’s new reading of the statute, \n5  contrary to the government’s contentions to an IJ, A.M. cannot lawfully be \n6  detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1), INA § 235(b)(1). \n7  124.  Consequently, this Court should determine that A.M.’s detention \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1), INA § 235(b)(1), is unlawful, and order either he be \n8 \nrestored to pre-detention requirement timelines or or that Respondents provide \n9 \nA.M. a bond hearing complying with the procedural requirements in Singh. And if \n10 \nthis Court determines, consistent with the BIA’s recent holding in Matter of Q. LI, \n11 \nthat 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A), INA § 1225(b)(2)(A), authorizes his continued \n12 \nmonitoring and custodial obligations, it should still order the government to cease \n13 \nprocessing A.M. under the obligations of the expedited removal authority, as they \n14 \nhave contended occurs now that he’s returned to 240 proceedings. .   \n15 \n125. Respondents released him, but have him doing in person check-ins,  \n16 \ntelemonitoring, and home visits, and had placed GPS restrictions on him.  Those \n17 \ncustodial monitoring from the unlawful detention and the reoccurrence of the \n18 \ndeprivation of his liberty exist to date.  \n19 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n20 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21 \nStatutory Violation \n22 \n(All Respondents) \n23 \n126. All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set herein. \n24 \n127. Respondents lack statutory authority to detain A.M. under 8 U.S.C. \n25 \n§1225(b)(1), INA § 235(b)(1), because that statute requires that the individual be \n26 \nan “arriving alien” (8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), INA § 235(b)(1)(A)(i)) or fall \n27 \nwithin specific designations (8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii), INA § \n28 \n   26                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1277     Page 28\nof 38\n \n \n1  235(b)(1)(A)(iii)), and be inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(C) or \n2  1182(a)(7), INA §§ 212(a)(6)(C), (a)(7). \n3  128. The expedited removal process under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) does not \n4  provide for administrative remedies or judicial review, which is a significant \n5  procedural aspect of the process. \n6  129. As A.M. does not meet these criteria, his detention must be governed by 8 \n7  U.S.C. § 1226(a), INA § 236(a), which provides discretionary detention authority \nand requires ICE to make an individualized custody determination.  \n8 \n130. Under § 1226(a), individuals may be detained as a matter of discretion,  \n9 \nreleased on their own recognizance, or released on a bond.   \n10 \n131. Respondents’ failure to apply the correct statutory framework violates the  \n11 \nINA and exceeds the government’s detention authority ‘voluntary departure, notice \n12 \nor an opportunity to respond, or asylum protections.   \n13 \nThe application of the unstated process is therefore ultra vires. \n14 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15 \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq.  \n16 \n(All Respondents) \n17 \n132.  All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set herein.  \n18 \n133. The government has not provided an explanation for its actions or the  \n19 \nappliable law but has incarcerated countless individuals alleged to be noncitizens at \n20 \ntheir court hearings. Notably, even the Alien Enemy Act (AEA) does not authorize \n21 \nthe removal of noncitizens without due process from the United States absent a \n22 \n“declared war” or a “perpetrated, attempted, or threatened” “invasion or predatory \n23 \nincursion” into the United States by a “foreign nation or government.” See 50 \n24 \nU.S.C. § 21. \n25 \n134. However, Petitioner was subject to immediate removal without  \n26 \nany guarantees the Respondents-Defendants will afford the privilege of voluntary \n27 \ndeparture, notice or an opportunity to respond, or asylum protections.   \n28 \n   27                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1278     Page 29\nof 38\n \n \n1  135. The application of the unstated process is therefore ultra vires.  \n2  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n3  Violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. \n4  (All Respondents) \n5  136. All of the foregoing allegations are repeated as if fully set forth herein. \n6  137. The INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., sets out the sole mechanisms established  \n7  By Congress for the removal of noncitizens. \n138. The INA provides that a removal proceeding before an immigration judge  \n8 \nunder  8  U.S.C.  §  1229a  is  “the  sole  and  exclusive  procedure”  by  which  the \n9 \ngovernment may determine whether to remove an individual, “[u]nless otherwise \n10 \nspecified” in the INA. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3). \n11 \n139. Such proceedings are governed by the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, and \n12 \nimplementing  regulations  at  8  C.F.R.  §§  1239,  et  seq.,  and  1240,  et  seq. \n13 \nImmigration judges are employees of the Department of Justice, housed under the \n14 \nExecutive Office for Immigration Review. \n15 \n140. The INA’s “exclusive procedure” and statutory protections apply to any  \n16 \nremoval of a noncitizen from the United States. Because the current process or \n17 \nconduct provides for the removal of Petitioner without the procedures specified in \n18 \nthe INA, it violates 8 U.S.C. § 1229a and the INA. \n19 \n141. As a result, the application of the Directive to Petitioner, which  \n20 \nwill result in their removal from the United States, is contrary to law. \n21 \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum \n23 \n(All Respondents) \n24 \n142. All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set herein.  \n25 \n143. The  Immigration  and  National  Act  (INA)  establishes  procedures  for \n26 \nasylum  applications  that  do  not  permit  Respondents  to  nullify  arbitrarily  and \n27 \n28 \n   28                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1279     Page 30\nof 38\n \n \n1  capriciously  properly  filed  applications  or  to  require  applicants  to  restart  the \n2  whole process without legal justification.  \n3  144. INA provides, “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United  \n4  States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of \n5  arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been \n6  interdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s \n7  status, shall apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, \nsection 1225(b) of this title.” 8 U.S.C §1158(a)(1). \n8 \n145.  Petitioner arrested at or about an asylum hearing violates federal asylum,  \n9 \nlaw because it impedes his ability to pursue his asylum claims.  \n10 \n146. Respondents’ application of Expedited Removal to Petitioner prevents  \n11 \nhim from applying for asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) and is contrary to law. \n12 \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n13 \nViolation of International Refugee Law and  \n14 \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal \n15 \n(All Respondents) \n16 \n147. Plaintiff reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate the  \n17 \nsame herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n18 \n148. The United States is a signatory to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status \n19 \nof Refugees, which incorporates Articles 2 through 34 of the 1951 United Nations \n20 \nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees. \n21 \n149. As implemented through the Refugee Act of 1980, these international \n22 \nobligations prohibit actions that would undermine an asylum seeker's right to seek \n23 \nprotection from persecution and to have their claims fairly adjudicated. \n24 \n150. Respondents' actions in detaining Petitioner and requiring a restart of the \n25 \nasylum process violate U.S. obligations under international refugee law by \n26 \nimposing arbitrary procedural obstacles that impede Petitioner's ability to pursue \n27 \nasylum protections. \n28 \n   29                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1280     Page 31\nof 38\n \n \n1  151. Further, the “withholding of removal” statute, INA § 241(b)(3), codified at \n2  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), bars the removal of noncitizens to a country where it is \n3  more likely than not that they would face persecution. \n4  152. Respondents’ Process violates the withholding of removal statute  \n5  because it does not provide adequate safeguards to ensure that Petitioner are not \n6  returned to a country where it is more likely than not they would face persecution. \n7  Accordingly, Respondents’ actions against Petitioner are contrary to law. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8 \nViolation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 \n9 \n(“FARRA”) codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note \n10 \nConvention Against Torture \n11 \n(All Respondents) \n12 \n153.  Plaintiff realleges all prior paragraphs as incorporated fully herein.  \n13 \n154. The United States is bound by the United Nations Convention Against  \n14 \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \n15 \n(“CAT”), which prohibits returning any individual to a country where it is more \n16 \nlikely than not that they would be subjected to torture. \n17 \n155. Article 3 of the CAT, as implemented by the Foreign Affairs Reform and  \n18 \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), and its regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 208.16–18, \n19 \nrequire that no person be removed to a country where they are likely to face torture \n20 \nat the hands of the government or with its acquiescence. \n21 \n156. Petitioner has expressed a credible and well-supported fear of torture upon  \n22 \nreturn to Morocco, supported by evidence including country conditions, \n23 \nmedical/psychological documentation, affidavits, and testimony. \n24 \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n25 \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22 \n26 \n(All Respondents) \n27 \n157. All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if set forth herein. \n28 \n   30                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1281     Page 32\nof 38\n \n \n1  158. The Directive requires that noncitizens whose removal is authorized \n2  unless “chargeable with actual hostility, or other crime against the public safety,” \n3  be allowed the full time stipulated by treaty to depart or a reasonable time in which \n4  to settle their affairs before departing. See 50 U.S.C. § 22. The Directive on its face \n5  denies Petitioner any time under Section 22 to settle their affairs, because it \n6  declares everyone subject to Expedite Removal, including asylum seekers who \n7  have already filed their I-589 and established they are afraid of returning to their \ncountry due to torture, persecution, or death. \n8 \n159. The current practice contravenes 50 U.S.C. § 22 and is ultra vires. \n9 \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n10 \nViolation of Due Process  \n11 \n(Access to Counsel, Right to Counsel, Petition the Government) \n(All Respondents) \n12 \n160.   Plaintiff reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n13 \nthe same herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n14 \n161. The First Amendment to the United States guarantees fundamental  \n15 \nfreedoms, including freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, the right to petition \n16 \nthe government, free exercise—including the detainees.  \n17 \n162.  The Fifth Amendment guarantees non citizens a right to a fair hearing.   \n18 \n163.  The  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  (INA)  guarantees  noncitizens  the \n19 \nright to counsel in connection with inadmissibility and deportability proceedings. \n20 \n8 U.S.C. §1362; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A); 62, 210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th \n21 \nCir.  2000);  Orantes-Hernandez  v.  Thornburgh,  919  F.2d  549,  564  (9th  Cir. \n22 \n1990)(affirming  injunction  prohibiting,  inter  alia,  immigration  officers  from \n23 \ninterfering with communication between detainees and attorneys). \n24 \n164.  Immigrant detains held pending a credible fear interview possess a First \n25 \nAmendment right to receive legal advice from their detained counsel.  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n   31                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1282     Page 33\nof 38\n \n \n1  165.  Defendants-Respondents’  policies,  practices,  and  conduct  are  denying \n2  access  to  counsel  and  obstructs  certain  freedoms  such  as  detainees’  right  to \n3  receive their counsel’s legal advice.  \n4  166. Plaintiffs have no plain adequate or complete remedy at law.  The relief \n5  sought is necessary to prevent continued and future irreparable injury.  \n6  NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n7  Violation of the U.S. Constitution \n(All Respondents) \n8 \n167.   Plaintiff reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n9 \nthe same herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n10 \n168.  The Constitution establishes due process rights for “all ‘persons’ within the \n11 \nUnited States, including [noncitizens], whether their presence here is lawful, \n12 \nunlawful, temporary, or permanent.” , 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001)). \n13 \n169. The Fourth Amendment guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures. \n14 \n170. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides for fair and  \n15 \nadequate hearing and an opportunity to be heard and  prohibits the federal \n16 \ngovernment from depriving any person—including noncitizens seeking asylum—\n17 \nof liberty without due process of law. \n18 \n171. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons”  \n19 \non United States soil and thus applies to Petitioner-Plaintiff A.M.  \n20 \n172. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection. \n21 \n173. A.M. have a life and liberty interest under the Due Process Clause. \n22 \n174. A.M.  was  in  formal  removal  proceedings  with  an  asylum  claim \n23 \nsubject to protections under the U.S. Constitution.  \n24 \n175. A.M. was denied a fair opportunity to present their case, Respondents’  \n25 \nactions prevented a lawful hearing and intimidated from accessing the courts.   \n26 \n176.  Moreover, A.M.’s detention is harsh and cruel as it bears no “reasonable \n27 \nrelation”  to  any  legitimate  government  purpose.  Zadvydas,  533  U.S.  at  690 \n28 \n   32                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1283     Page 34\nof 38\n \n \n1  (finding  immigration  detention  is  civil  and  thus  ostensibly  “nonpunitive  in \n2  purpose and effect”). The sole basis of his detention—expedited removal—are \n3  unlawful for the reasons discussed supra. Here, there is every indication that his \n4  “detention is not to facilitate deportation, or to protect against risk of flight or \n5  dangerousness, but to incarcerate for other reasons.” Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. \n6  510, 532-33 (2003) (Kennedy, J., concurring). \n7  177. The arrest at an asylum hearing violates procedural due process because it  \nfurthers no legitimate purpose other than chill or prevent access to the court system \n8 \nwith those attempting to comply, not to mention a compelling government interest.  \n9 \n178. The mechanics of how ICE courthouse arrests occur is unnecessary,  \n10 \nconfusing, and not related to advancing the governments interest.   \n11 \n32. Respondents' arbitrary actions in detaining Petitioner, continuing to deprive \n12 \nhim of his liberty, and requiring a restart of the asylum process also violate \n13 \nsubstantive due process protections against government action that \"shocks the \n14 \nconscience\" or interferes with rights \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" \n15 \nTENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n16 \nViolation of Habeas Corpus \n17 \n(All Respondents) \n18 \n179. Plaintiff realleges all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n19 \nthe same herein by this reference.  \n20 \n180. The protection of habeas corpus is enshrined in Article I, section 9 of the  \n21 \nUnited States Constitution.  \n22 \n181. Though Respondent’s released Petitioner, with signing away his rights, this \n23 \nis capable of repetition, yet evading review; \n24 \n182. Detainees have the right to file for habeas corpus to challenge the legality \n25 \nof their detention or raise claims related to their detention or the basis of removal. \n26 \n183. The detention of Petitioner under Expedited Removal has violated and \n27 \n28 \n   33                               \n  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 88     Filed 08/19/25     PageID.1284     Page 35\nof 38\n \n \n1  continues to violate his right to habeas corpus. See 28 U.S.C. §2241; U.S. Const. \n2  art. I, § 9, cl. 2 (Suspension Clause). \n3  ELEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n4  (Administrative Procedure Act)(“APA”) \n5  (All Respondents) \n6  184. All of the allegations are repeated and re-alleged as though set herein.  \n7  185. The APA prohibits agency action that is arbitrary and capricious. \n186. Respondents' actions in detaining Petitioner and requiring Petitioner to \n8 \nrestart the asylum application process constitute \"final agency action\" within the \n9 \nmeaning of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n10 \n187. The detention of asylum seekers at their immigration hearings without a  \n11 \nlegitimate justification is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \n12 \nnot in accordance with the law” and accordingly violates the APA. 5 U.S.C. §706.  \n13 \n188.  Respondents' actions were taken \"without observance of procedure \n14 \nrequired by law\" in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D), including but not \n15 \nlimited to the failure to provide adequate notice and opportunity to be heard \n16 \nregarding Petitioner's detention and the requirement to restart the asylum process. \n17 \n189. Under the APA, a “person compelled to appear in person before an agency \n18 \nor representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised \n19 \nby counsel….” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) \n20 \n190.  Plaintiff compelled to appear before an agency for a credible fear interview \n21 \nand are denied the  accompaniment, representation, and advice of counsel before \n22 \nand during such interviews, in violation of the APA. \n23 \n191. The APA instructs courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action”  \n24 \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \n25 \nwith law[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Defendants may only exercise authority \n26 \nconferred by statute. City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297-98 (2013).  \n27 \n192.

This case arises out of the sweeping immigration enforcement actions that  \nthe government began unannounced at the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Building \n8 \nand Courthouse in the Southern District of California. As a part of an official \n9 \nmemo, Respondents, including leadership and agents of the U.S. Immigration and \n10 \nCustoms Enforcement, planned to and did arrest noncitizens, detaining them at the \n11 \ncourthouse  without  notice  or  an  opportunity  to  be  heard,  set  for  immediate \n12 \nexpulsion from the United States at an unprecedented speed.   \n13 \n2.  Petitioner respectfully seeks this Court enjoin the abusive, overly broad, \n14 \nand harassing practice of using the courthouses to conduct civil courthouse arrests \n15 \nwithout  a  bench  warrant,  impose  indefinite  ‘mandatory’  detention,  and  forced \n16 \nremoval without due process as asylum seekers and other noncitizens lawfully \n17 \nappear for their mandated courtroom appearances.   \n18 \n3.  DHS’s actions reflect the recent unparalleled levels of practices that violate  \n19 \nthe immigration laws, statutory law, foreign treatises, and the U.S. Constitution.   \n20 \n4.  Defendant-Respondents’ current practice of: \n21 \n(i) the overzealous courthouse arrests of anyone whom the government  \n22 \nhas “information that believes the target…will be at a specific location” like the \n23 \nfederal building and U.S. courthouse,  \n24 \n(ii)  deprivation of due process in detaining applicants who are  \n25 \nlawfully asserting their rights to seek asylum,  \n26 \n(iii)  unlawful policy, practice, or conduct of revoking the notice to  \n27 \nappear  to  place  into  immediate  removal  and  deprive  noncitizens  and  asylum \n28 \n   1                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.180     Page 3 of\n42\n \n \n1  seekers of due process, has a profound chilling effect on the fundamental pillars of \n2  the rule of law, access to the courts, and access to justice.  \n3      This unlawful government behavior of courthouse arrests was enjoined in \n4  Elizeo Velazquez-Hernandez, et al., v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enf’t, et al., \n5  No. 3:20-CV-2060 (DMS)(KSC), 2020 WL 6712223 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2020). \n6  Courts1 have similarly prohibited this conduct.  \n7  5.  Respondents’ actions violate their own memos, the constitution and  \nstatutory protections. On or about May 27, 2025, Respondents revoked its own \n8 \nrules without notice that prohibited arrests at or within the courthouses but also \n9 \nhave not followed its own published guidance. The expansive quotas under the \n10 \nICE Directive Enforcement Actions have incentivized improper actions in or near \n11 \nCourthouses. Defendants-Respondents have the universe of their information.  \n12 \nA recent policy, practice, or conduct in San Diego believed based on the \n13 \nInterim Guidance: Civil Immigration Enforcement Actions in or near Courthouses \n14 \n(May 27, 2025), replacing the January 21, 2025 Directive and has unlawfully applied \n15 \nan overly broad interpretation, arbitrary and capricious practice, and rules \n16 \nreversal emboldening ICE officers or agents to conduct unfettered civil \n17 \nimmigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they believe the \n18 \ntargeted [noncitizen] is or will be present at a specific location” and patently \n19 \nignores the previous directive “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed \n20 \nby the jurisdiction” or the agency’s own published instructions that they will \n21 \nrefrain entirely due to the irreparable damage. Defendants have main access to \n22 \ntheir universe. Plaintiff alleges the following and will seek leave to amend: \n23 \n \n24 \n1 See, e.g., Ryan v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 467 F. Supp. 3d 228 (D. Mass. 2020); \nState of New York v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, No. 19-cv-8876, 2020 WL 2117584 \n25 \n(S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2020); Liu v. Chertoff, No. C07-2566, 2007 WL 1211290 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 23, \n26  2007) (injunction issued to limit ICE arrests at courthouses to protect access to immigration \nhearings); Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 (2009) (recognizing the importance of fair process in \n27 \nimmigration hearings). \n \n28 \n   2                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.181     Page 4 of\n42\n \n \n1  EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES \n2  Plaintiff-Petitioner has no adequate administrative remedy available and \n3  exhaustion is required because the claim is collateral to removal proceedings and \n4  raises systemic due process violations.  He has a right to appeal until July 3, 2025; \n5  he was not a flight risk; upon efforts to preserve his rights, all were thwarted:            \n6  (i) USCIS rejected his asylum claim between the brief stint of leaving the court and \n7  filing that day due to ‘detention’, (ii) the Bureau of Immigration & Appeals could \nnot find his name or alien number, (iii) the final ICE alternative is a discretionary \n8 \nstay of removal, however, Respondents’ agents flatly noted those are not approved. \n9 \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n10 \n6.  Plaintiff-Petitioner A.M. is and has been a human right defender and a  \n11 \nleader at a well-acclaimed international non-governmental organization and has \n12 \ncontributed to critical reporting to the United Nations, European Commission \n13 \non Human Rights, Cornell Law School Legal Clinic, Robert Kennedy Human \n14 \nRights, and global organizations.   \n15 \n7.  He was a champion who fled for his life when he refused to promote  \n16 \nMorocco on an international stage.  \n17 \n8.  A.M. presented himself at the San Ysidro Port of Enry on or about January  \n18 \n29, 2025.  He presented himself to seek asylum but he was released with a Notice \n19 \nto Appear under 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that he’s \n20 \nan alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled.  \n21 \n9.  A.M. complied with the rules, notices, and appeared in court prepared  \n22 \nto  present  his  lawful  claim  with  I-589  filings  in  July  of  2025,  appearance  in \n23 \nAugust,  supplemental  I-589  in  October  of  2024,  presented  self  in  November, \n24 \nbriefing in January of 2025, supplemental filings in the spring and May of 2025. \n25 \n10.  On or about June 3, 2025, he prepared to present his asylum claims at his  \n26 \nscheduled individual merits hearing on June 3, 2025.    \n27 \n11.  A.M. was finally eligible to apply for work authorization with the  \n28 \n   3                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.182     Page 5 of\n42\n \n \n1  Employment Authorization Document (EAD)(Form I-765); his asylum clock had \n2  been tolled for A.M. to seek representation and had fully prepared his case over the \n3  course of nearly five hundred (500) days.   \n4  12.  Plaintiff-Petitioner’s witnesses were prepared to testify from overseas  \n5  that day even in spite of recent hospitalization and unknown availability due to his \n6  health at later date.  \n7  13.  In an abundance of caution, due to the recent raids of witnesses and court  \nattendees, in an abundance of caution, Petitioner re-submitted his witness list for a \n8 \nsubsequent time to list as ‘Motion’ to clarify that the request was via WebEx or \n9 \ntelephonically, instead of in person.  Plaintiff-Petitioner was prepared and willing \n10 \nto testify at his merits hearing, independent of them.  \n11 \n14.  Noticeably upon entry, the courthouse climate had changed. Petitioner is  \n12 \ninformed and believes he could hear ICE agents by the door throughout the \n13 \nhearing and could see them upon entering and exiting.  As Petitioner stepped \n14 \noutside of the doorway, Petitioner was summarily arrested within the Edward J. \n15 \nSchwartz building once the immigration judge dismissed his case upon the U.S. \n16 \ngovernment’s request, and in spite of the court acknowledging A.M. has a lawful \n17 \nright to seek asylum, withholding of removal, and/or convention against torture \n18 \nprotections under the Immigration and Nationality Act.   \n19 \n15.  Petitioner is informed that Respondents knew or should have known that \n20 \nthis deprivation of the notice and right to be heard was an overt intentional tactic \n21 \nand policy abuse to prevent the adjudication of a strong asylum claim and remove \n22 \nA.M. without due process forcing him into terrifying and ambiguous proceedings \n23 \nof immediate removal or indefinite detention when he had been fully compliant.  \n24 \n16.  In fact, Plaintiff-Petitioner is informed and believes that an internal memo  \n25 \nwent to the judges who are within the Executive Branch, to increase dismissals.  \n26 \n17.  A provisionary class member entered in November 2023, was released into  \n27 \nthe community after a Notice to Appear, was arrested on or about May 22, after \n28 \n   4                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.183     Page 6 of\n42\n \n \n1  DHS  moved  to  dismiss  his  proceedings  and  the  Immigration  Judge  dismissed \n2  despite counsel’s request for a continuance.   \n3  18.  Other prospective class members were told to self deport but very well may  \n4  already be a lawful permanent resident or citizen and have to assert their rights at \n5  the Edward J. Schwartz federal building and U.S. courthouse.   \n6  19.  Plaintiff-Petitioner is informed and believes that there are other similarly  \n7  situated  applicants  who  don’t  speak  English  fluently,  detained  at  their  court \nhearings, have been unable to access counsel and seek protections and relief with \n8 \nan emergency stay of removal to be able to access their rights and counsel.   \n9 \nA. Federal Building Courthouse Arrests - Habeas Corpus and Due Process \n10 \n20.  In recent statements, behavior, and practice, Respondents-Defendants have  \n11 \ndemonstrated little interest or regard for adhering to America’s foundational and \n12 \nbedrock  principles  of  due  process,  habeas  corpus,  and  rule  of  law.                                  \n13 \nRecently, on or about May 20, 2025, at her confirmation hearing, Respondent-\n14 \nDefendant  KRISTI  NOEM2  erroneously  responds:  \"Habeas  corpus  is  a \n15 \nconstitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this \n16 \ncountry”.  \n17 \n21.  Here, in San Diego, A.M. who presented himself lawfully for his asylum  \n18 \nhearing was separated from his attorney and upon is informed and believes, not \n19 \nclearly advised on why he is being detained or explained the process protecting his \n20 \nprocedural and substantive due process rights, after the United States government \n21 \nwithdrew his notice to appear in court to terminate his asylum case.  Respondents’ \n22 \nagents could not advise on the process, next steps or ensure protections. \n23 \n24  22.  Defendants-Respondents stated ICE is not granting any requests for stays  \n25  of removal. \n26   \n2 See Testimony of Kristi Noem, Dep’t of Homeland Sec. (May 20, 2025), available at  \n27 \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/videos/ce8113z7k17o; https://www.c-\nspan.org/classroom/document/?23993 \n28 \n   5                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.184     Page 7 of\n42\n \n \n1  23.  Notably, Defendants- Respondents’ agents were confused, unclear, and  \n2  unfamiliar on the process, next steps, or information on Petitioner, and could not \n3  provide any policies or protections that his rights are preserved as a matter of law.   \n4  24.  Plaintiff-Petitioner is informed and believes that separate hours of  \n5  independent  research  and  conversations  with  legal  observers  to  discover  that \n6  Respondents  shifted  the  protections  from  the  Mayorkas  memo  and  reverted  to \n7  refusing  to  recognize  courthouses  as  “Sensitive  Locations”  and  maintains  that \n8  Respondents in the San Diego Field Office leadership in particular “The Assistant \n9  Field  Office  Director  and  Assistant  Special  Agents  in  Charge”  possesses  full \n10  authority and discretion to civilly arrest individuals in and around any courthouse.  \n11  25.  The courthouse arrest policy purports to re-vest ICE with the  \n12  unbridled  and  boundless  discretion  to  make  civil  arrests  in  and  around \n13  virtually any courthouse location when the U.S. Government deems a person \n14  is an “alien” at a specified location.  \n15  26.  Defendants-Respondents have not stated or provided this DHS policy. \n16  27.  Defendants-Respondent’s newly enacted policies, practices, and procedures  \n17  fail to account for significant issues such as the historic sanctity of courthouses and \n18  the chilling impact these policies have on anyone attending a federal office. \n19  28.  Shortly after taking office, the President issued ICE Directive Enforcement  \n20  Actions in or Near Courthouses (Jan. 21, 2025) DHS Directive Enforcement Actions in \n21  or Near Protected Areas (Jan. 20, 2025) and where such action is not precluded by \n22  laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action \nwill take place.3 The new memorandum supersedes the Mayorkas memorandum \n23 \nentitled ‘Guidelines for Enforcement Actions in or Near Protected Areas’ (October \n24 \n25 \n26   \n3  See Memorandum on ICE Directive Enforcement Actions in or Near Courthouses (Jan. 21, 2025); \n27 \nDHS Directive Enforcement Actions in or Near Protected Areas (Jan. 20, 2025);  Interim Guidance: \nCivil Immigration Enforcement Actions in or near Courthouses (May 27, 2025). \n28 \n   6                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.185     Page 8 of\n42\n \n \n1  27, 2021), replacing with ICE Policy No. 11072.4 Interim Guidance: Civil \n2  Immigration Enforcement Actions in or near Courthouses. (May 27, 2025). Id.  \n3  29.  Plaintiff-Petitioner is informed and believes Respondents-Defendants’  \n4  engaged  in  a  concerted  effort  to  dismiss  their  cases  to  deprive  them  of  due \n5  process.4 Plaintiff-Petitioner is informed and believes that there were complaints of \n6  detainees were removed or deported on the same day.   \n7  30.  Ultimately, the courthouse arrest policy simply formalizes aspects of  \nDirective or unknown instructions, which vest ICE with unfettered discretion \n8 \nto  use  courthouses  as  a  trap  to  arrest  anyone  they  suspect  of  being  a \n9 \nnoncitizen at any location —including asylum seekers who are honoring their \n10 \nconditions and mandates imposed by Respondents.  \n11 \n31.  With these Directives and memos, the President abandoned past  \n12 \nprograms and protections and called for the deportation of anyone potentially \n13 \nremovable, i.e. lawful green card holders, parolees, and in practice, asylum \n14 \nseekers--- with published mandatory quotas of 3,000 daily removals in \n15 \ndisregard of the fundamental principles of due process.                                    \n16 \nToday, a recent memo to immigration judges obtained by NBC News provides \n17 \nfresh insight into how the Trump administration is pulling off a new tactic —\n18 \n dismissing pending immigration cases, then immediately moving to arrest the \n19 \nimmigrants — that is part of its bid to increase the number of detentions. \n20 \n32.  Despite widespread opposition to this practice, Respondents have not  \n21 \nonly refused to stop it but has issued official policies authorizing civil \n22 \ncourthouse arrests. DHS’s courthouse arrest policies, and its extensive \n23 \n24 \n \n25  4 See e.g., Chris\tGross,\tMolly\tSheets, ICE\tagents\tarrest\tmigrants\tat\tcourthouses\tin\tSan\tDiego, Across\t\nCountry\tCBS 8\tSan\tDiego,\tMay 22, 2025,\thttps://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/ice-agents-arrest-\n26 \nmigrants-at-courthouses-in-san-diego/509-1b3d0519-2132-49fa-ad76-fdb58af37a32\t;\tSee e.g., Alex\t\nCheney, ICE\ttactics\tspark\tfear\tas\tmigrant\tarrested\tpost-heraing\tin\tSan\tDiego,\tAcross\tUS,\t\tCBS 8\tSan\tDiego,\t\n27 \nMay 27, 2025,\thttps://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/ice-tactics-migrants-arrested-post-hearing-\nsan-diego/509-e66acde1-18bd-42d5-b40b-1bb479d963e4;\t\t\n28 \n   7                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.186     Page 9 of\n42\n \n \n1  practice of conducting civil arrests at asylum hearings, are unprecedented in \n2  United States history.   \n3  33.  At the same time, Respondents have prohibited that the use of Web Ex or  \n4  virtual appearances by Plaintiffs-Petitioners and required that asylum seekers \n5  appear physically in person in the federal immigration court.  \n6  34.  Plaintiff is informed and believes Respondents are authorizing their  \n7  agents to be wearing Balaclava, full face covering masks, while hovering at or \nabout the courtroom doors.   \n8 \n35.  Curiously enough, the updated memo expressly provides, “ICE officers  \n9 \nshould generally avoid enforcement near non-criminal or specialized courts. \n10 \n36.  Petitioners-Plaintiffs have complained of intimidating, aggressive arrests,  \n11 \nno notice, and chaotic scenes in which the public were refused entry or deterred \n12 \nfrom asserting their lawful rights in the federal building and courthouse: \n13 \n37.  By way of example, on or about May 22, 2025, Plaintiff is informed and  \n14 \nbelieves that Respondents’ resulted in the arrest of the wrong persons, including a \n15 \nman who hyperventilates and collapses to the ground.  DOES Officers used force \n16 \nagainst asylum seekers, shoved attorneys and members of the public.  \n17 \n38.  Plaintiffs contend that Respondents used unnecessary force, shoving \n18 \nattorneys, applicants, and members of the public.   \n19 \n39.  ICE went to detain a man who collapsed to the ground and started to  \n20 \nhyperventilate.  Plaintiff is informed and believes a DOE Officer responded, “calm \n21 \ndown, it’s not that big of a deal.” Plaintiff is informed and believes that DOE \n22 \nofficers shoved attorneys and members of the public.  \n23 \n40.  During the week of May 18, 2025, Respondents’ commenced immigration  \n24 \nraids at or about the Edward J. Schwartz Building.  \n25 \n41.  On or about May 22, 2025, Plaintiff is informed Respondents arrested  \n26 \ndetained at least 13 individuals at or about the courtroom door.   \n27 \n42.  On or about May 23, Plaintiff is informed and believes Respondents  \n28 \n   8                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.187     Page 10\nof 42\n \n \n1  detained at least 7 and perhaps more. \n2  43.  During the week, Plaintiff is informed and believes Respondents continued  \n3  to arrest and detain individuals their courtroom hearings.  \n4  44.  On or about May 27, Plaintiff is informed and believes that ICE conducts  \n5  warrantless arrests at or about the courtroom doors.  \n6  45.  On or about May 28, Plaintiff is informed and believes witnesses heard  \n7  Respondent’s making jokes about being the ‘Gestapo’. \n46.  On or about May 30, 2025, Plaintiff is informed and believes DOE Officers  \n8 \narrested an individual seeking legal representation. \n9 \n47.  During this week, Plaintiff is informed and believes multiple witnesses  \n10 \nobserve ICE supervising agents discussing a list with the government attorneys \n11 \nwho were seeking to dismiss the cases. Plaintiff is informed and believes that list \n12 \nwas being provided to the EOIR.  \n13 \n48.  On or about June 2, 2025, Plaintiff is informed and believes ICE officers  \n14 \nare continued to make warrantless arrests, detaining and separating parents from \n15 \ntheir children without notice or an opportunity to be heard. 5 \n16 \n49.  On or about June 2, Plaintiff is informed and believes ICE Officers were  \n17 \nlaughing and jovial about all those detained who did not have an attorney.  \n18 \n50.  On or about June 3, 2025, at least 10 officers cornered two members of the  \n19 \npublic. \n20 \n51.  During this week Plaintiff is informed and believes another dozen of  \n21 \napplicants were detained at their asylum hearings via warrantless arrests. \n22 \n52.  On or about June 9, 2025, Plaintiff is informed and believes a DOE  \n23 \nSupervisor stated an attorney must determine who would be detained of his two \n24 \nclients, it was irrelevant to him who was detained.  \n25 \n \n26  5 Many of those who saw loved ones handcuffed and taken away had accompanied their family \nmembers to ongoing immigration processes seeking asylum or hoping to make a case before a \n27 \njudge to stave off deportation, a legal process long afforded to immigrants and spelled out for \nimmigration judges in court practice manuals. \n28 \n   9                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.188     Page 11\nof 42\n \n \n1  53.  Plaintiff is informed and believes that immigration attorneys are reporting  \n2  that their clients are not showing up to court due to Respondents’ Policies Practices \n3  and Procedures.    \n4  54.  Plaintiff is informed and believes a Memorandum of Understanding,  \n5  directive, policy was instructing these raids.  \n6  55.  DHS has made clear that anyone who is subject to arrest by DHS may be  \n7  arrested in the courthouse, and courthouse arrests are not limited to defendants in \ncriminal matters – the arrests are of asylum seekers, witnesses, or anyone DHS \n8 \nbelieves is a “targeted alien…” who is or will be present at a specific location.”   \n9 \n56.  To be clear, Defendants- Respondents have already had Plaintiffs in  \n10 \ncustody and processed their biometrics and backgrounds, including all information \n11 \nnecessary for civil immigration enforcement purposes. They have no interest or \n12 \nneed in re-arrest for those reasons. Respondents’ only interest is to keep Plaintiffs \n13 \nincarcerated or removed expeditiously from the country  \n14 \n57.  Plaintiffs-Petitioners have established that their incarceration is not \n15 \nrequired for their immigration cases, as they reliably appeared for court hearings.  \n16 \nCommon Law and Constitutional protections \n17 \n58.  ICE practices are interfering with the public’s access to the federal building  \n18 \nand the courthouses. In addition to deviating from prior policy, the U.S. Supreme \n19 \nCourt long ago recognized a privilege against civil arrests for those attending \n20 \ncourt on official business—a privilege that traces its roots back to English \n21 \ncommon law and rests on the common-sense principle that the judicial system \n22 \ncannot function if parties and witnesses fear that their appearance in court \n23 \nwill be a trap. \n24 \n59.  DHS’s decision to flout the long-standing common-law privilege against  \n25 \ncivil courthouse arrests and to commandeer the courtrooms of the Southern District \n26 \nof California for federal civil immigration purposes has led Plaintiff-Petitioner(s) \n27 \nto reasonably fear civil arrest should they appear in court at their upcoming court \n28 \n   10                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.189     Page 12\nof 42\n \n \n1  dates. They know that when their case ends, an immigration agent lurking in the \n2  courtroom  will  be  ready  to  civilly  arrest  them  and  place  them  in  removal \n3  proceedings. DHS’s policy to civilly arrest them in court following the conclusion \n4  of  their  misdemeanor  prosecutions  forces  the  Petitioners-Plaintiffs  to  choose \n5  between coming to court as ordered and exercising their common-law right to be \n6  free from civil arrest in court. \n7  60.  In addition to the Plaintiffs- Petitioners’ own fear of civil arrest, the First,  \n8  Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to receive equal protection and \n9  present witnesses and to a public trial are violated because the policy instills fear in \n10  potential witnesses and court observers who have reason to fear civil arrest at or \n11  about the Edward J. Schwartz federal building and U.S. courthouse. \n12  61.  DHS’s civil-courthouse-arrest policies not only undermine the  \n13  Administration of Justice, they are also illegal for at least four reasons. \n14  62.  First, DHS’s courthouse arrest policies are arbitrary and capricious in  \n15  violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) because the policies are \n16  insufficiently explained, fail to consider all relevant factors, and depart from prior \n17  policy  without  reasoned  explanation.  Further,  DHS’s  implementation  of  the \n18  policies is inconsistent. ICE’s policy states that arrests will take place “inside” the \n19  courthouses or at “non-public entrances and exits,” but arrests do not always take \n20  place inside the courthouse. For example, officers chased a client and his lawyer \n21  down  Broadway  Street  adjacent  to  the  courthouse  and  arrested  the  client.  The \n22  lawyer asked the officers to identify themselves and to produce a warrant, and the \n23  officers refused and further ordered the lawyer to back away under threat of arrest \n24  if he did not cooperate. ICE arrests outside of a courthouse are an arbitrary and \n25  capricious application of its policy. See Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \n26  Sec., No. C19-2043 TSZ, 2020 WL 1819837, at *26–27 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 10, \n27  2020)  (ICE’s  practice  of  arresting  immigrants  outside  courthouses,  presents  a \n28 \n   11                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.190     Page 13\nof 42\n \n \n1  plausible claim that the policy is arbitrary and capricious under the APA). \n2  63.  Second, Congress never authorized DHS to conduct civil courthouse arrests  \n3  because  it  never  abrogated  the  longstanding  and  well-settled  common-law \n4  privilege  against  such  arrests.  The  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  the \n5  common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests is “well settled.” Stewart v. \n6  Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 129 (1916). When Congress acts in an area governed by \n7  “long-established and familiar” common-law principles, Congress is presumed to \n8  retain those principles. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534 (1993). Here, \n9  where Congress granted the federal government a general civil-arrest power to \n10  enforce  civil  immigration  laws,  Congress  retained  traditional  common-law \n11  limitations  on  that  arrest  power—including  that  such  arrests  cannot  be  made \n12  against parties and witnesses attending court on official business. Because the INA \n13  does not grant the federal government authority to conduct civil courthouse arrests \n14  in violation of the common-law privilege, DHS’s policies authorizing such arrests, \n15  and its policies to conduct such arrests, exceed DHS’s statutory authority and must \n16  be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n17  64.  Third, DHS’s policies violate the Constitutional right of access to the  \n18  courts,  which  prohibits  “systemic  official  action  [that]  frustrates  a  plaintiff  or \n19  plaintiff class in preparing and filing suits.” Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, \n20  413, 415 & n.12 (2002). Conditioning litigants’ ability to access the courts on \n21  risking  civil  arrest  creates  precisely  such  impermissible  frustration.  Indeed, \n22  common-law courts created the privilege against civil courthouse arrest to prevent \n23  the intolerable chilling effect of such arrests, explaining that the fear of arrest \n24  would “prevent [parties and witnesses’] approach,” obstructing “the administration \n25  of justice.”  Halsey v. Stewart, 4 N.J.L. 366, 368 (N.J. 1817). Plaintiffs found, \n26  however,  that  if  they  come  to  court  as  ordered  they  face  the  specter  of  civil \n27  courthouse arrest whether they win or lose their case.  \n28 \n   12                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.191     Page 14\nof 42\n \n \n1  65.  Fourth, DHS conducts the civil courthouse arrests without a judicial \n2  warrant authorizing the arrests as required by law. 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2). Pursuant \nto  section  1357(a)(2),  DHS  must  have  “reason  to  believe”  that  the  arrestee  is \n3 \nviolating immigration law and that the arrestee is “likely to escape before a warrant \n4 \ncan  be  obtained.  .  .  .”  But  Petitioners-Plaintiffs  consistent  appearance  at  court \n5 \ndemonstrates otherwise. DHS could have sought a warrant in the months while \n6 \nPlaintiffs’ cases were pending.  DHS did not. Failure to obtain a warrant during the \n7 \npendency of the cases is the product of indolence, not necessity, and it violates \n8 \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs’ statutory and constitutional rights.  \n9 \n66.  For these reasons, and as set forth below, Plaintiffs ask this Court to  \n10 \ndeclare that DHS’s policies authorizing civil arrests in the U.S. courthouses of \n11  the Southern District of California are unlawful, to declare that DHS’s \n12  current practices and tactics including failing to obtain a warrant and \n13  courthouse arrests is illegal, and to enjoin DHS from such activity.  \nThe common-law privilege against civil arrest \n14 \n67.  The common-law privilege against civil arrest while attending court on  \n15 \nofficial business is longstanding, tracing its origins back at least to the English \n16 \ncourts in the eighteenth century. \n17 \n68.  In England, and in the early years of this country, civil arrest, or civil  \n18 \ncapias, was a common means for initiating civil proceedings. See Nathan Levy, Jr., \n19 \nMesne Process in Personal Actions at Common Law and the Power Doctrine, 78 \n20 \nYale L.J. 52, 61-70 (1968). The possibility that such civil arrests could take place \n21 \nin court, however, posed a significant problem for the judiciary: If a party or \n22 \nwitness’s appearance in a case could be used as a trap for a civil arrest in another \n23 \ncase, many parties and witnesses would not attend court. To avoid this problem, \n24 \ncourts both in England and the United States—including the U.S. Supreme \n25 \nCourt—recognized and strictly enforced an “inflexib[le]” privilege against the civil \n26 \narrest of parties or witnesses attending court. Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. \n27 \n28 \n   13                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.192     Page 15\nof 42\n \n \n1  446, 448 (1923). As the Supreme Court explained, “the due administration of \n2  justice requires that a court shall not permit interference with the progress of a case \n3  pending before it, by the service of process in other suits, which would prevent, or \n4  the fear of which might tend to discourage, the voluntary attendance of those \n5  whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial administration in the \n6  pending litigation.” Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222, 225 (1932). \n7  69.  The common-law privilege against civil arrest while attending court on  \n8  official business is longstanding, tracing its origins back at least to English courts \n9  in the eighteenth century. Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England \n10  explained  the  common-law  rule  that  “[s]uitors,  witnesses,  and  other  persons, \n11  necessarily attending any courts of record upon business, are not to be arrested \n12  during  their  actual  attendance,  which  includes  their  necessary  coming  and \n13  returning.”  3  William  Blackstone,  Commentaries  on  the  Laws  of  England  289 \n14  (1769); see also 6 Matthew Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 530 (London, A. \n15  Strahan, 7th ed. 1832) (“[A]ll [] persons whatsoever, are freed from arrests so long \n16  as they are in view of any of the courts at Westminster, or if near the courts, though \n17  out of view, lest any disturbance may be occasioned to the courts or any violence \n18  used.”). This principle was repeatedly endorsed by the English courts, which held \n19  that, “for the purpose of justice,” and “to encourage witnesses to come forward \n20  voluntarily,”  they  are  privileged  from  arrest  “in  coming,  in  staying,  and  in \n21  returning”. The King v. Holy Trinity in Wareham, 99 Eng. Rep. 531 (1782); see \n22  also Meekins v. Smith, 126 Eng. Rep. 363 (1791) (“[A]ll persons who had relation \n23  to a suit which called for their attendance, whether they were compelled to attend \n24  by process or not, (in which bail were included,) were [e]ntitled to privilege from \n25  arrest eundo et redundo, provided they came bona fide.”); Spence v. Stuart, 102 \n26  Eng. Rep. 530 (1802); Ex Parte Byne, 35 Eng. Rep. 123 (1813). \n27  70.  The U.S. Supreme Court adopted this privilege and held that it bars service  \n28 \n   14                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.193     Page 16\nof 42\n \n \n1  of  any  other  civil  process  while  attending  court.  For  instance,  in  Stewart  v. \n2  Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128 (1916), the Court described the privilege as “well settled,” \n3  explaining that a litigant “should be permitted to approach [the courts], not only \n4  without subjecting himself to evil, but even free from the fear of molestation or \n5  hindrance. He should also be enabled to procure, without difficulty, the attendance \n6  of all such persons as are necessary to manifest his rights.” Id. at 129. The Court \n7  described it as particularly firmly established that there was an “exemption from \n8  arrest,” or “capias,” and held that this exemption applied to any civil process to \n9  protect  the  “necessities  of  the  judicial  administration,  which  would  be  often \n10  embarrassed, and sometimes interrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with process \n11  while attending upon the court for the protection of his rights, or the witness while \n12  attending to testify.” Id. at 130. The Court later emphasized the “necessity of [the \n13  rule’s]  inflexibility”  in  order  to  serve  its  purpose  of  protecting  litigants  and \n14  witnesses in appearing in court. Page Co., 261 U.S. at 448; see also Long v. Ansell, \n15  293  U.S.  76,  83  (1934)  (Brandeis,  J.)  (describing  “the  common-law  rule  that \n16  witnesses, suitors, and their attorneys, while in attendance in connection with the \n17  conduct of one suit, are immune from service in another”); Lamb, 285 U.S. at 225. \n18  71.  Each applicant was not a flight risk as they lawfully appeared for their  \n19  hearings in pursuing their statutory rights.  In fact, Respondent-Defendants rely on \n20  Plaintiffs’ lack of flight risk, lying in wait to arrest and punish them when they do \n21  appear for their hearings.  By insisting Plaintiffs be re-arrested for their removal or \n22  seeking the asylum process, these agencies threaten the integrity of the proceedings \n23  and ignore the reasonable alternative, namely that their interests in initiating the \n24  removal  process  for  these  Plaintiffs  –  individuals  who  have  been  found  to  be \n25  neither flight risks or dangers to the community and who indeed appear when the \n26  government asks them to – can be accomplished without having to arrest them. \n27  Petitioners-Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  the  profound  disregard  of  common  law, \n28 \n   15                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.194     Page 17\nof 42\n \n \n1  statutory protections, international treatises, and basic rule of law in San Diego \n2  72.  DHS’s reinstated the previously enjoined practice of civilly arresting  \n3  people in the federal building and courthouses of the Southern District of \n4  California who are present for official court business unduly infringes upon \n5  Plaintiffs-Petitioners’  shared  common-law  right  to  be  free  from  civil \n6  courthouse arrest: \n7  DHS officers are routinely present in the U.S. courthouses in the Southern \nDistrict of California to effectuate civil immigration arrests of Plaintiffs \n8 \nwhen they appear in court for their asylum hearings \n9 \n73.  Immigration agents are believed to have arrested scores of people and  \n10 \nplan to do so for even more in perhaps the hundreds or thousands inside  \n11 \nthe federal building and courthouses of the Southern District of California. \n12 \n74.  Defendants- Respondents agents attend these hearings so they can  \n13 \neffectuate a civil courthouse arrest. That means ICE officers are present and poised \n14 \nto  conduct  administrative  arrests  at  every  immigration  hearing  in  the  Southern \n15 \nDistrict of California where the government requests dismissals.  \n16 \n75.  When immigration officers attend the Plaintiffs’ hearings, they patrol the  \n17 \nhallways and hover next to the exit of the courtroom at the time of the proceeding.  \n18 \n76.  The officers are equipped with handcuffs and plan to effectuate a civil  \n19 \narrest to place the defendant in immigration custody at the conclusion.  \n20 \nDHS officers conduct courthouse arrests without official warrants in or about \n21  the U.S. Courthouses in the Southern District of California  \n22  77.   On information and belief, Plaintiffs believe that DHS intends to effectuate  \n23  warrantless  immigration  arrests  of  plaintiffs  coming  to  court,  while  present  at \n24  court, or leaving court in connection with their pending immigration cases.  \n25  78.  If at all, Defendants-Respondents have deployed administrative signed  \n26  by staff, not court-ordered judicial warrants by a magistrate or federal judge.  \n27  79.   Plaintiffs-Petitioners have been out of custody for months, are in  \n28 \n   16                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.195     Page 18\nof 42\n \n \n1  compliance with the conditions including attending all court hearings, and they do \n2  not present a risk of flight before DHS could obtain a warrant.  \n3  DHS’s civil courthouse arrest policies harm Plaintiffs by forcing them to \nappear in court believing that they could be subjected to an unlawful civil \n4 \narrest in the courthouse at any time. \n5 \n80.  Plaintiffs-Petitioners are appearing for their defensive asylum hearings. At  \n6 \nthis ‘trial’, their credibility would surely be challenged on cross examination. But \n7 \nthe Plaintiffs-Petitioners are all alleged to be undocumented aliens in the United \n8 \nStates and their character witnesses may be similarly undocumented.  \n9 \n81.  Plaintiffs’-Petitioners’ decision on whether to testify at trial and call  \n10 \ncharacter witnesses, or other witnesses, in support of their asylum case is chilled by \n11 \nthe looming presence of immigration officers in court, targets certain groups, and \n12 \nused to harass or retaliate. Plaintiffs fear that full exercise of their rights to present \n13 \na defense could lead to the arrest of undocumented witnesses or members of the \n14 \npublic who come to court to observe the proceedings. \n15 \nB. Asylum, Withholding of Removal, Convention Against Torture \n16 \n82.  Plaintiffs-Petitioners sought fairness, due process protection, and the rule  \n17 \nof law in the United States:   \n18 \n83.  A.M. has long filed an asylum application and requested a credible fear  \n19 \ninterview. He fears for detention and harm from Morocco and now faces arbitrary \n20 \ndetention in the United States.  He seeks protections against being placed on a \n21 \nplane to a country where he has no ties, El Salvador, Sudan, or back to the country \n22 \nwhere he fled for his life from persecution, torture, and death threats.   \n23 \n84.  A.M. and others are being subjected to expedited removal despite  \n24  Respondents having knowledge of their claims for asylum and credible fear of \n25  persecution  the  Convention  against  Torture.  The  agency’s  refusal  to  provide  a \n26  meaningful credible fear determination, arrest, resetting the clock, and detaining \n27  the asylum seeker violates procedural due process and statutory rights under 8 \n28 \n   17                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.196     Page 19\nof 42\n \n \n1  U.S.C. § 1158 and § 1231(b)(3).  The restarting of proceedings is highly prejudicial \n2  and serves no legitimated government basis other than to harass, intimidate, delay, \n3  and increase taxpayers’ money especially as A.M. was scheduled for his asylum \n4  individual merits hearing on the day he was arrested.   \n5  85.   Plaintiffs-Petitioners assert their rights to be free from civil arrest in this  \n6  Complaint. To be clear, Plaintiffs do not argue that the Defendants-Respondents \n7  could not effectuate criminal arrests in the courthouse. Notably, DHS arrests that \nmerely place a person in immigration proceedings are civil arrests. See I.N.S. \n8 \nv. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1039 (1974) (holding that deportation \n9 \nproceedings are “purely” civil); Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 407 (2012) \n10 \n(holding that “it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present” in the \n11 \nUnited States and that deportation proceedings are civil).  \n12 \n86.  DHS officers attend asylum and immigration hearings relating to whether  \n13 \nthey have experienced persecution, likely to be persecuted, eligible for asylum, \n14 \nwithholding of removal or and ready to civilly arrest Petitioners-Plaintiffs once the \n15 \nhearings are pre-determined to be dismissed.  The anticipated arrests occur \n16 \nregardless of the veracity or strength of the claim - whether it be through a \n17 \nGovernment or Court’s granting the motion to dismiss– the officers are waiting to \n18 \neffectuate a warrantless civil arrest at or about the courtroom.  \n19 \n87.  Petitioner is informed and believes this opaque and obfuscatory policy,  \n20 \nprocedure, and/or practice is denying credible claims to statutory protections, and \n21 \nsubjecting eligible applicants with colorable claims to persecution, torture, or death \n22 \nagainst United States and international law.  \n23 \nC. Expedited Removal  \n24 \n88.  This is time-sensitive because the current U.S. government has been \n25 \nalleged to have sent asylum seekers, lawful permanent residents, and even U.S. \n26 \ncitizens  overseas  without  due  process,  and  have  not  been  able  to  retrieve  or \n27 \naccount for their whereabouts.  \n28 \n   18                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.197     Page 20\nof 42\n \n \n1  89.  Expedited removal has applied to those who were in the country less than \n2  fourteen (14) days and within 100 miles of the border. 8 C.F.R. 2385.3(b). \n3  90.  Defendants-Respondents are using dismissing a section 240 case to trigger  \n4  removal in an overt evasion of procedural due process and statutory protections.  \n5  91.  Defendants-Respondents’ refer to Section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and  \n6  Nationality Act (INA), as mandating that noncitizens subject to expedited removal \n7  be detained throughout the process, changing the rules for all those impacted here.  \n92.  Courts have provided protections against Expedited Removal.   \n8 \n93.  Defendants-Respondents’ actions are retaliatory for those engaging in  \n9 \nprotected activity like filing an asylum claim or appearing at their mandated court \n10 \ncases. The government should not be forcing expedited removal as Petitioners-\n11 \nPlaintiffs have a right and sought a motion to appeal at the Bureau of Immigration \n12 \nof Appeals.  BIA could not find Petitioners to seek an emergency stay.   \n13 \n94.  The government has not guaranteed the due process rights of noncitizens.   \n14 \nA Proclamation signed on March 14 and published on March 15, the President \n15 \ninvoked a war power, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (“AEA”), to summarily \n16 \nremove noncitizens from the U.S. and bypass the immigration laws Congress has \n17 \nenacted.  See  Invocation  of  the  Alien  Enemies  Act  (Mar.  15,  2025)  1 \n18 \n(“Proclamation”). The Proclamation accused Venezuelan noncitizens of being part \n19 \nof Tren de Aragua (“TdA”), a criminal gang. On the evening of March 15, 2025, \n20 \nthe D.C. District Court issued an order temporarily pausing removals pursuant \n21 \nProclamation of a provisionally certified nationwide class. J.G.G. v. Trump, No. \n22 \n25-5067,  2025  WL  914682,  at  *2  (D.C.  Cir.  Mar.  26,  2025).  That  order  was \n23 \nappealed by the government, but the court of appeals denied a stay. Id.  \n24 \n95.  In April 2025, the Supreme Court ruled that immigrants even under the  \n25 \nAlien  Enemies  Act  are  entitled  to  advance  notice  of  their  removal  and  a \n26 \nmeaningful opportunity to challenge their deportation through legal avenues. On \n27 \nApril 7, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court granted the government’s application \n28 \n   19                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.198     Page 21\nof 42\n \n \n1  to stay on the basis Petitioners would proceed through habeas, emphasizing those \n2  are “entitle[d] to due process” and notice “within a reasonable time and in \n3  such manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief” before removal. \n4  Trump v. J.G.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL 102409 (U.S. Apr. 7, 2025). \n5  96.  The government has not stated the type of notice they intend to  \n6  provide or how much time they will give individuals before seeking to remove \n7  them. However, in a hearing in other jurisdictions in the Southern District of Texas \non Friday, April 11, the government said they had not ruled out the possibility that \n8 \nindividuals will receive no more than 24 hours’ notice; the government did not say \n9 \nwhether  it  was  considering  providing  even  less  than  24  hours.  In  light  of  the \n10 \nSupreme Court’s ruling that challenges to the Proclamation must be brought in \n11 \nhabeas, Petitioners file this action in his district of confinement and arrest.   \n12 \n97.  At or about end of May of 2025, Respondents started to show up at the \n13 \nimmigration courts at valid asylum hearings and arrest the applicants at their court \n14 \nhearings in San Diego, at or about 880 Front Street, Edward J. Schwartz Federal \n15 \nBuilding and U.S. Courthouse, and stating that they will remove those applicants \n16 \nwho are apprehended and withdrew the notice and opportunity to be heard.   \n17 \n98.  On June 4, 2025, with uncertainty and lack of clarity, A.M. petitioned this \n18 \ncourt for a writ of habeas corpus, a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, \n19 \nand emergency temporary restraining order (which this court granted), for fear of \n20 \nthose  in  immigration  custody  in  danger  of  imminent  removal  from  the  United \n21 \nStates (less than 24-hour notice) – and this court could potentially permanently \n22 \nlose  jurisdiction.  Petitioner  fears  of  the  imminent  danger  of  being  transferred \n23 \noutside of the Southern District of California en route to removal without a notice \n24 \nto appear, indefinite detention, and the lack of the opportunity to be heard and thus \n25 \nrequest an injunction on any transfer out of the Southern District of California, as \n26 \nwell as a 30-day notice of any intent to remove and due process protections. \n27 \n/// \n28 \n   20                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.199     Page 22\nof 42\n \n \n1  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2  99.

Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”)  \n6  104. Plaintiff-Petitioner is a 35-year-old Western Sahrawi man who has been a  \n7  human  rights  Defender  at  an  internationally  well-respected  non-governmental \norganization that has presented to the United Nations and European Commission of \n8 \nHuman Rights who is detained at the Otay Mesa Facility in San Diego and who, \n9 \nhaving reported to his hearing, is at imminent risk of removal and current practices \n10 \nthat the Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been deploying in San Diego.  \n11 \n105. A.M. is seeking asylum on the basis of his political views, membership in a  \n12 \nsocial group, race-ethnicity, fear of harm, persecution, and mistreatment from his \n13 \ngovernment due to his immutable characteristics and human rights leadership.   \n14 \n106. A.M. is diabetic and has medical complications due to past persecution and  \n15 \nrequires access to daily medications and consistent medical care.   \n16 \n107. The U.S. government has publicly stated that those with asylum claims  \n17 \nwould proceed with their credible fear and asylum rights as a matter of law.   \n18 \n108. However, after lawfully presenting himself for his asylum hearing, he was  \n19 \nArrested immediately at the downtown Courthouse on June 3, 2025.     \n20 \n109. Petitioners’ attorney provided Respondents with his G-28 Notice of Entry  \n21 \nof Appearance as an Attorney in an Abundance of Caution. \n22 \n110. Plaintiff-Petitioner’s Counsel reached out to Respondents and still has not  \n23 \nhad access to him.  His family feared that he was being interrogated without his \n24 \nattorney.  \n25 \n111.  Plaintiff-Petitioner’s legal representation endeavored to connect with him.   \n26 \nInitially he could not be found in the system; the following day he could not be \n27 \nfound and was being processed”.  Subsequently, Plaintiff’s Counsel reached out to \n28 \n   22                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.201     Page 24\nof 42\n \n \n1  his ICE Officer, CORE CIVIC, and by and through Respondents’ Counsel.  To \n2  date, Counsel has not been able to speak with him similar to the admonitions about \n3  those Petitioners who are unrepresented cannot access counsel. \n4  112. Plaintiff-Petitioner fears being deported, being unable to speak with his  \n5  attorney, being denied adequate medical care, and being sent back to a country \n6  where he will be imprisoned, tortured, and likely killed by the Moroccan police \n7  since they have done previously to him.  He fears that the Moroccan authorities \nwill target him because of his political opinion, because he and his family are \n8 \nknown human rights activists.    \n9 \n113. The government did not provide adequate notice or an opportunity to be  \n10 \nheard on why he is being detained but rather planned to ship him overseas and out \n11 \nof this jurisdiction without due process rights.  \n12 \n114. A.M. and other Plaintiff-Petitioner are those who were similarly arrested  \n13 \nat the downtown courthouse, 880 Front Street, deprived of their credible fear \n14 \ninterviews, and are at risk of being sent on an airplane out of the jurisdiction \n15 \nor country without an opportunity to access or speak with an attorney despite \n16 \ntheir credible fear claims.   \n17 \n115. To the extent able, Petitioner brings this action under Federal Rules of  \n18 \nCivil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2)6 on behalf himself and as an emergency and/or \n19 \npreliminary  injunctive  relief  claim  to  preserve  the  rights  of  all  other  persons \n20 \nsimilarly situated who have been arrested or detained for appearing at their court \n21 \nhearings, deprived the right of speaking to an attorney and are being subjected to \n22 \nbe sent overseas without notice or an opportunity to be heard on their credible fear \n23 \n \n24  Julia\tAinsley,\tTrump\tAdmin\tTells\tImmigration\tJudges\tto\tDismiss\tCases\tin\tTactic\tThat\tCould\tSpeed\tArrests,\t\nNBC\tNews\t(May\t31,\t2024,\t6:02\tPM),\thttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-\n25  admin-tells-immigration-judges-dismiss-cases-tactic-speed-arrest-rcna212138.\t\n6 In a separate motion for emergency- injunctive provisional class certification, \n26 \nPlaintiff-Petitioner briefs the issue insofar that the eligible class has been detained, \n27  may be unrepresented, have not been able to access attorneys that A.M. seek to \nprotect his and their rights under time-sensitive, unprecedented circumstances.   \n28 \n   23                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.202     Page 25\nof 42\n \n \n1  claims in the Southern District Court of California.  \n2  There’s commonality, typicality, adequacy, and numerosity: \n3  a.  The provisionary class members for an emergency order are subject to a \n4  common  practice:  courthouse  arrests,  deprivation  of  asylum  protections, \n5  summary removal, contrary to the INA, statutory protections, constitutional \n6  and common law.   \n7  b.  Commonality:  Rule  23(a)(1)  The  suit  also  raises  questions  of  law  and \npractice common to members of the proposed class, including whether the \n8 \nDirective and its implementation of summary removal violate the APA, the \n9 \nINA, Fifth Amendment, and the statutory protections for asylum seekers.  \n10 \nThe  proposed  class  includes  numerous  future  noncitizens  who  will  be \n11 \nsubject to Respondents’ Directive and related policies or practices.  This is \n12 \nfiled to prevent the irreparable harm in which the detained will incur if they \n13 \nare sent overseas without a notice and opportunity to be heard or protections \n14 \nfor their credible fear of being harmed, tortured, or killed.  \n15 \nc.  Numerosity Rule 23(a)(2)   \n16 \nThere is numerosity because there has been scores believed to be arrested, \n17 \nincluding dozen a day including at least throughout the weeks of May 20, \n18 \nMay 27, May 28, June 3, June 5, and the on-going future members impacted.  \n19 \nd.  Typicality (Rule 23(a)(3) \n20 \nTypicality applies here because all have suffered or will suffer the same \n21 \nconstitutional  and  statutory  violations  or  claims  as  a  result  of  the \n22 \ngovernment’s challenged practice, and because they seek singular injunctive \n23 \nand corresponding declaratory relief that remedy those injuries.   \n24 \ne.  Adequacy (Rule 23(a)(4)) \n25 \nThe proposed class satisfies the requirements as the representative \n26 \nPetitioners seek the same relief as the other members of the class – \n27 \nincluding, an order declaring the Directive unlawful and an injunction \n28 \n   24                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.203     Page 26\nof 42\n \n \n1  preventing the unlawful policy, practice, or procedure.  Plaintiffs and their \n2  counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n3  f.  The proposed class also satisfies Rule 23(b)(2).  Respondents have acted \n4  (or will act) on grounds generally applicable to the class by subjecting them \n5  to summary removal under the Proclamation rather than affording them the \n6  protection of immigration laws.  Injunctive and declaratory relief is therefore \n7  appropriate with respect to the whole.   \n116. Petitioners-Plaintiffs share the similar commonality in having complied  \n8 \nwith and the U.S. government’s rules until the rules were arbitrarily changed.  \n9 \n117. Under current DHS practice, numerous other asylum-seekers are being  \n10 \narrested and detained at their asylum, hearings. \n11 \n118. Plaintiffs have seen immigration officers waiting in court presumably to  \n12 \narrest him/her at prior court appearances if the case had concluded and believes \n13 \nthat  he/she  and/or  their  witnesses  face  likely  civil  immigration  arrest  in  court \n14 \nfollowing conclusion of the hearing.   \n15 \n119. There is overwhelming medical evidence that the incarceration of a person  \n16 \nwill have a negative impact on their well-being especially where there are other \n17 \ntraumatic factors at work, and that damage can be permanent.    \n18 \n120. For these reasons set forth herein, Plaintiff ask this court to declare DHS’s \n19 \npolicies authorizing civil arrests in the federal building and courthouses of the \n20 \nSouthern District Court of California are unlawful, to declare that DHS’s practice \n21 \nof filing to obtain a warrant for courthouse arrests is illegal, and to enjoin DHS \n22 \nfrom sending noncitizens to countries without notice and a credible fear interview.   \n23 \nB.

All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set herein.  \n11 \n135. The government has not provided an explanation for its actions or the  \n12 \nappliable law but has incarcerated countless individuals alleged to be noncitizens at \n13 \ntheir court hearings.. Notably, even the AEA does not authorize the removal of \n14 \nnoncitizens  from  the  United  States  absent  a  “declared  war”  or  a  “perpetrated, \n15 \nattempted, or threatened” “invasion or predatory incursion” into the United States \n16 \nby a “foreign nation or government.” See 50 U.S.C. § 21.. \n17 \n136. But Petitioners-Plaintiffs are being subject to immediate removal  \n18 \nwithout any guarantees the Respondents-Defendants will afford the privilege of \n19 \nvoluntary departure, notice or an opportunity to respond, or asylum protections.   \n20 \n137. The application of the unstated process is therefore ultra vires.  \n21 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. \n23 \n(All Respondents) \n24 \n138. All of the foregoing allegations are repeated as if fully set forth herein. \n25 \n139. The INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., sets out the sole mechanisms established  \n26 \nBy Congress for the removal of noncitizens. \n27 \n140. The INA provides that a removal proceeding before an immigration judge  \n28 \n   28                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.207     Page 30\nof 42\n \n \n1  under  8  U.S.C.  §  1229a  is  “the  sole  and  exclusive  procedure”  by  which  the \n2  government may determine whether to remove an individual, “[u]nless otherwise \n3  specified” in the INA. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3). \n4  141. The current policy, conduct creates an alternative removal mechanism  \n5  outside of the immigration laws set forth by Congress in Title 8. \n6  142. The INA’s “exclusive procedure” and statutory protections apply to any  \n7  removal of a noncitizen from the United States. Because the current process or \nconduct provides for the removal of Petitioners without the procedures specified in \n8 \nthe INA, it violates 8 U.S.C. § 1229a and the INA. \n9 \n143. As a result, the application of the Directive to Petitioners-Plaintiffs, which  \n10 \nwill result in their removal from the United States, is contrary to law. \n11 \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12 \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum \n13 \n(All Respondents) \n14 \n144. All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set herein.  \n15 \n145. The INA provides, “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United  \n16 \nStates or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of \n17 \narrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been \n18 \ninterdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s \n19 \nstatus, shall apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, \n20 \nsection 1225(b) of this title.” 8 U.S.C §1158(a)(1). \n21 \n146.  Petitioners-Respondents arrest after a hearing violates federal asylum, law  \n22 \nbecause it impedes their ability to pursue their asylum claims.  \n23 \n147. Respondents’ application of Expedited Removal to Petitioners prevents  \n24 \nthem from applying for asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) and is contrary to law. \n25 \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n26 \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal \n27 \n(All Respondents) \n28 \n   29                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.208     Page 31\nof 42\n \n \n1  148. Plaintiffs reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate the  \n2  same herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n3  149. The “withholding of removal” statute, INA § 241(b)(3), codified at 8  \n4  U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), bars the removal of noncitizens to a country where it is more \n5  likely than not that they would face persecution. \n6  150. Respondents’ Process violates the withholding of removal statute  \n7  because it does not provide adequate safeguards to ensure that Petitioners are not \nreturned to a country where it is more likely than not they would face persecution. \n8 \nAccordingly, Respondents’ actions against Petitioners are contrary to law. \n9 \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n10 \nViolation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 \n11 \n(“FARRA”) codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note \n12 \nConvention Against Torture \n13 \n(All Respondents) \n14 \n151.  Plaintiffs realleges all prior paragraphs as incorporated fully herein.  \n15 \n152. The United States is bound by the United Nations Convention Against  \n16 \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \n17 \n(“CAT”), which prohibits returning any individual to a country where it is more \n18 \nlikely than not that they would be subjected to torture. \n19 \n153. Article 3 of the CAT, as implemented by the Foreign Affairs Reform and  \n20 \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), and its regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 208.16–18, \n21 \nrequire that no person be removed to a country where they are likely to face torture \n22 \nat the hands of the government or with its acquiescence. \n23 \n154. Petitioner has expressed a credible and well-supported fear of torture upon  \n24 \nreturn to Morocco, supported by evidence including country conditions, \n25 \nmedical/psychological documentation, affidavits, and testimony. \n26 \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n27 \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22 \n28 \n   30                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.209     Page 32\nof 42\n \n \n1  (All Respondents) \n2  155. All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if set forth herein. \n3  156. The Directive requires that noncitizens whose removal is authorized \n4  unless “chargeable with actual hostility, or other crime against the public safety,” \n5  be allowed the full time stipulated by treaty to depart or a reasonable time in which \n6  to settle their affairs before departing. See 50 U.S.C. § 22. The Directive on its face \n7  denies Petitioners any time under Section 22 to settle their affairs, because it \ndeclares everyone subject to Expedite Removal, including asylum seekers who \n8 \nhave already filed their I-589 and established they have fear of returning to their \n9 \ncountry due to torture, persecution, or death. \n10 \n157. The current practice contravenes 50 U.S.C. § 22 and is ultra vires. \n11 \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12 \nViolation of Due Process Under the First Amendment \n13 \n(Right to Provide Legal Advice, Right to Counsel, Petition the Government) \n14 \n(All Respondents) \n15 \n158.   Plaintiffs reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n16 \nthe same herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n17 \n159. The First Amendment to the United States guarantees fundamental  \n18 \nfreedoms, including freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, the right to petition \n19 \nthe government, free exercise.  \n20 \n160. Upon information and belief, Defendants-Respondents’ policies, practices,  \n21 \nand conduct are denying access to counsel and obstructs certain freedoms.  \n22 \n161. Plaintiffs-Petitioners have certain rights to access their counsel.  \n23 \n162. Plaintiffs-Petitioners are informed and believe Defendants-Respondents’  \n24 \npolicies, practices, and conduct are denying noncitizens their rights to \n25 \ncommunicate with counsel, in violation of the First Amendment.  \n26 \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n27 \nViolation of Due Process Under the Fourth, Fifth, Fourteenth Amendment \n28 \n   31                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.210     Page 33\nof 42\n \n \n1  (All Respondents) \n2  163.   Plaintiffs reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n3  the same herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n4  164. The Fourth Amendment guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures. \n5  165. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides for fair and  \n6  adequate hearing and an opportunity to be heard. \n7  166. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons”  \non United States soil and thus applies to A.M. and Petitioners-Plaintiffs. \n8 \n167. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection. \n9 \n168. A.M. have a life and liberty interest under the Due Process Clause. \n10 \n169. A.M. was denied a fair opportunity to present their case, Respondents’  \n11 \nactions prevented a lawful hearing, and intimidated from accessing the courts.   \n12 \n170. The arrest at an asylum hearing violates procedural due process because it  \n13 \nfurthers no legitimate purpose other than chill or prevent access to the court system \n14 \nwith those attempting to comply, not to mention a compelling government interest.  \n15 \n171. The mechanics of how ICE courthouse arrests occur is unnecessary,  \n16 \nconfusing, and not related to advancing the governments interest.   \n17 \n172. The U.S. Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention without prompt notices  \n18 \nof charges or meaningful opportunity to be heard. \n19 \nNINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n20 \nViolation of Habeas Corpus \n21 \n(All Respondents) \n22 \n173. Plaintiffs realleges all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n23 \nthe same herein by this reference.  \n24 \n174. The protection of habeas corpus is enshrined in Article I, section 9 of the  \n25 \nUnited States Constitution.  \n26 \n175. Detainees have the right to file for habeas corpus to challenge the legality \n27 \nof their detention or raise claims related to their detention or the basis of removal. \n28 \n   32                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.211     Page 34\nof 42\n \n \n1  176. The detention of Petitioners under Expedited Removal has violated and \n2  continues to violate their right to habeas corpus. See 28 U.S.C. § 2241; U.S. Const. \n3  art. I, § 9, cl. 2 (Suspension Clause). \n4  TENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  (Administrative Procedure Act)(“APA”) \n6  (All Respondents) \n7  177. All of the allegations are repeated and re-alleged as though set herein.  \n178. The APA prohibits agency action that is arbitrary and capricious. \n8 \n179. The detention of asylum seekers at their immigration hearings without a  \n9 \nlegitimate justification is arbitrary and capricious and accordingly violates the \n10 \nAPA. 5 U.S.C. §706.  \n11 \n180. There is no legitimate purpose in detaining Petitioners at the asylum  \n12 \nhearing as they were about to adjudicate their claims and now costs the U.S. \n13 \nincreased costs to detain or ship off to an unknown location overseas. \n14 \n181. The APA instructs courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action”  \n15 \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \n16 \nwith law[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Accordingly, defendants may only exercise \n17 \nauthority conferred by statute. City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297-98 \n18 \n(2013). \n19 \nCOUNT I \n20  DHS’s Courthouse Arrest Policy is Arbitrary, Capricious, an Abuse of \nDiscretion, or Otherwise Not in Accordance with Law in Violation of the \n21  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n22  182. DHS’s enforcement policy any “alien” may be arrested at a known location \n23  is a final agency action subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act.  \n24  183. DHS’s policies regarding courthouse arrest are arbitrary and capricious  \n25  because Respondents-Defendants do not sufficiently explain to whom the policies \n26  apply, fail fully to consider the foreseeable harms and/or costs of the policies, do \n27  not adequately explain its prioritizing of civil arrests in or near courthouses over \n28 \n   33                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.212     Page 35\nof 42\n \n \n1  the severe harms triggered by those arrests, and do not adequately justify the \n2  change from Respondents-Defendants’ prior policies. \n3  184. DHS’s application of their policies are further arbitrary and capricious as  \n4  applied to the Plaintiffs because all of the Plaintiffs have been ruled not to be a risk \n5  of flight when the magistrate set bond in their criminal prosecutions. Plaintiffs are \n6  all in compliance with the conditions of their pretrial release, which is further \n7  evidence that their arrest at court does not further a legitimate need by ICE to arrest \nthem because their removal can be accomplished without detaining them anew. \n8 \nMoreover, Defendants are not complying with their own policies.  \n9 \n185. Plaintiffs-Petitioners have been lawfully playing by the rules.  At the least  \n10 \nthey should be provided voluntary departure.  \n11 \n186.    DHS’s courthouse arrest policies are arbitrary and capricious for a  \n12 \nmultitude of reasons including their failure to explain this historic deviation in \n13 \npolicy, the application of the policies is inconsistent, and the policies fail to \n14 \nadvance legitimate immigration enforcement interests. \n15 \n187. Defendants’ violation causes ongoing and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs. \n16 \nCOUNT II \n17 \nDHS’s Courthouse Arrest Policies Exceed Statutory Authority in Violation of \n18  the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) \n19  (All Respondents) \n20  188. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the  \n21  preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n22  189. The Administrative Procedure Act instructs courts to “hold unlawful and  \n23  set aside agency action” that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \n24  limitations....” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n25  190. There exists a longstanding common-law privilege against civil arrest of  \nwitnesses, parties, and others attending court on official business recognized by \n26 \nboth federal and state courts.  \n27 \n28 \n   34                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.213     Page 36\nof 42\n \n \n1  191. The validity of DHS authorizing civil arrest of parties and witnesses  \n2  attending court depends on whether the grant of power to conduct civil arrests \n3  somehow abrogated the well-settled common law privilege that civil arrests cannot \n4  be used to arrest parties, witnesses and those attending court on official business. \n5  192. Given the “longstanding [] principle that statutes which invade the common  \n6  law are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established \n7  and familiar principles,” a statute must “speak directly to the question addressed by \n8  the common law” to “abrogate a common-law principle.” Texas, 507 U.S. at 534 \n9  (1993) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The statute authorizing \n10  DHS to conduct civil immigration arrests does not “speak directly to the question \n11  addressed by the common law”—i.e., it does not speak to whether DHS can use a \n12  party or witness’s appearance in court as a trap for purposes of a civil arrest. \n13  Instead, the statute simply authorizes arrest and detention, while saying nothing \n14  about how, when, or where such arrests may take place. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), \n15  1357(a).  Thus,  the  power  Congress  granted  to  DHS  to  conduct  civil  arrests \n16  inherently contains within it the common-law limitation that parties, witnesses, and \n17  others attending court on official business are privileged from civil arrest. \n18  193. To the extent there is any ambiguity concerning whether the INA  \n19  incorporates or abrogates the common-law privilege, the constitutional concerns \n20  raised  by  DHS’s  courthouse  arrest  policies,  resolve  that  ambiguity  in  favor  of \n21  interpreting the statute to limit DHS’s authority. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. \n22  371,  380-82  (2005)  (when  there  are  “competing  plausible  interpretations  of  a \n23  statutory text,” courts should apply “the reasonable presumption that Congress did \n24  not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts”). \n25  194.   Abrogating the common-law privilege violates the Constitutional right of \n26  access to the courts, which prohibits “systemic official action [that] frustrates a \n27  plaintiff or plaintiff class in preparing and filing suits.” Christopher v. Harbury, \n28 \n   35                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.214     Page 37\nof 42\n \n \n1  536  U.S.  403,  413,  415  &  n.12  (2002).  Such  “frustrat[ion]”  includes  not  only \n2  policies that ban access outright, but also obstruct access. E.g., id. at 413. Forcing \n3  noncitizens to risk civil arrest at the courts creates such impermissible frustration.  \n4  195.  DHS’s most recent policies authorize civil courthouse arrests that  \n5  Congress never authorized DHS to conduct and contravene their own policies, \n6  regulations, and procedures that asylum seekers relied upon. The policies are \n7  thus “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” and “arbitrary, \n8  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.” \n9  conduct should be unlawful and set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n10  196.  The courthouse arrests impact noncitizen communities broadly, instilling  \n11  fear and distrust of the government, law enforcement, and the judiciary.  \n12  197. Congress’ general grant of power to DHS to conduct civil arrests did not  \n13  abrogate  the  well-settled  common  law  privilege  that  prohibits  civil  arrests  of \n14  parties, witnesses and others attending court on official business.  \n15  198. If asylees show up to court, they might get arrested, detained indefinitely,  \n16  or sent back to the country where they fled persecution, but if they do not appear, a \n17  judge may rule adversely against them and permanently lose their rights. \n18  199.   DHS’s courthouse arrest policies authorizing civil arrests of people in,  \n19  or  traveling  to  or  from,  courthouses,  and  DHS’s  practice  of  carrying  out  civil \n20  arrests against individuals attending federal immigration courthouses within the \n21  Southern District of California, thus exceed DHS’s statutory authority.  \n22  200.  The policies are “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or  \n23  limitations” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(C).  \n24  201.   Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n25  COUNT III \nDHS’s Courthouse Arrest Policies Violate the Right of Access to the Courts \n26 \n202. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the  \n27 \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n28 \n   36                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.215     Page 38\nof 42\n \n \n1  203. Defendants’ actions deprive Plaintiffs of meaningful access to the federal  \n2  courthouses of the Southern District of California in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights \n3  under the United States Constitution. \n4  204. Policies that ban access outright and policies that obstruct the right of  \n5  access to courts in more subtle ways are prohibited.  \n6  205. Forcing noncitizens who have been fully compliant to choose between  \n7  exercising their right to present asylum claims or risk being subjected to a civil \n8  arrest at a federal courthouse in the Southern District of California impermissibly \n9  frustrates  the  right  of  access  to  courts,  as  protected  by  the  First,  Fifth,  Sixth, \n10  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  \n11  206. DHS’s courthouse arrest policies, practices, and conduct were adopted by  \n12  Defendants without any consideration of the foreseeable harms of their policy, \n13  without  adequate  explanation  of  their  prioritizing  civil  arrests  in  or  around \n14  courthouses over those harms, and without adequate justification of the change \n15  from Defendants’ prior policies on courthouse arrests.  \n16  207. The courthouse arrest policies are therefore unconstitutional because they  \n17  infringe on Plaintiffs’ right to access the courts free from fear of civil arrest.  \n18  208. These policies, practices, and procedures cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nCOUNT IV \n19 \nDHS’s Warrantless Courthouse Arrests Violate 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) because \nPlaintiffs Are Not a Flight Risk and the Arrests therefore Violate the \n20 \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \n21 \n209. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth fully herein. \n22 \n210. Plaintiffs allege that DHS has not obtained a warrant for their arrest in  \n23 \ncompliance  with  8  U.S.C.  §  1357(a)(2).  Section  1357(a)(2)  authorizes  DHS  to \n24 \nmake warrantless arrests only if (1) there is “reason to believe” the alien is present \n25 \nin the United States in violation of immigration law; and (2) the alien “is likely to \n26 \nescape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest. . . .”  \n27 \n211. Courts have continually recognized and required strict adherence to § 1357.  \n28 \n   37                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.216     Page 39\nof 42\n \n \n1  See  Arizona  v.  United  States,  567  U.S.  387,  408,  410  (2012)  (holding  that  an \n2  Arizona  statute  was  preempted  because  it  purported  to  give  Arizona  law \n3  enforcement  greater  warrantless  arrest  authority  “than  Congress  has  given  to \n4  trained federal immigration officers,” emphasizing that warrantless arrest authority \n5  is limited to situations where there is a likelihood of escape before a warrant can be \n6  obtained); Mountain High Knitting, Inc. v. Reno, 51 F.3d 216, 218 (9th Cir. 1995) \n7  (holding that this statute requires an individualized determination of flight risk); \n8  United  States  v.  Meza-Campos,  500  F.2d  33  (9th  Cir.  1975)  (applying  an \n9  individualized likelihood-of-escape analysis).7 \n10  212. DHS cannot show that Plaintiffs pose a risk of escape before it can obtain a  \n11  warrant.  Plaintiffs  are  all  out  of  custody  on  bond  in  their  petty  offense \n12  prosecutions, and their release on bond required a magistrate judge to rule that they \n13  do not pose an unreasonable risk of flight. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ criminal cases \n14  have all been pending for many months, and DHS could have used this time to \n15 \n \n16 \n7 See also, De La Paz v. Coy, 786 F.3d 367, 376 (5th Cir. 2015) (“[E]ven if an \n17  agent has reasonable belief, before making an arrest, there must also be a \nlikelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.”); \n18 \nMorales v.

Reno, 202 F.3d 475, 479-80 (1st Cir. 2000) (commenting \nthat an immigration arrest was “in direct violation” of § 1357(a)(2) because \n26 \n“[w]hile INS agents may have had probable cause to arrest Westover by the time \n27  they took her into custody, there is no evidence that Westover was likely to escape \nbefore a warrant could be obtained for her arrest”). \n28 \n   38                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.217     Page 40\nof 42\n \n \n1  obtain a warrant. Even if DHS can establish a reason to believe that Plaintiffs are \n2  present in the United States in violation of immigration law, it cannot establish that \n3  Plaintiffs are “likely to escape” when it has failed to obtain a warrant during the \n4  months while Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ cases have been pending.  \n5  213. Petitioners-Plaintiffs seek to enjoin DHS from arresting them without a  \n6  federal warrant while at court, and on their way to and from court appearances \n7  mandated by their petty offense prosecutions. Plaintiffs conclusively show that \n8  they are not “likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained,” § 1357(a)(2), \n9  because they are in compliance with the court-ordered conditions of bond.  \n10  214. Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ cases have been pending for months or nearly two  \n11  years and the length of time has afforded DHS sufficient time to obtain a warrant.  \n12  215. Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ compliance with court orders for the pendency of  \n13  their Immigration cases and appearance in court as ordered defeats any argument \n14  that they pose a risk of flight before a warrant can be obtained. The Court should \n15  therefore enjoin DHS from arresting Plaintiffs without a warrant while on their \n16  way to court, at court, or departing court in connection with their asylum rights.  \n17  COUNT V \nDHS’s Warrantless Federal Building Courthouse Arrests Violate Plaintiffs’ \n18 \nFourth Amendment Rights \n19 \n216. Petitioners-Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in  \n20 \neach of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n21 \n217. The Fourth Amendment guarantees Plaintiffs the right to be free from  \n22 \n“unreasonable searches and seizures. . .” Plaintiffs assert DHS intends to arrest \n23 \nthem when they appear in court without a warrant.  \n24 \n218. “[U]nlike illegal entry, mere unauthorized presence in the United  \n25 \nStates is not a crime.” Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1000 (9th Cir. 2012). \n26 \nDHS’s warrantless courthouse arrests are not in response to new criminal activity; \n27 \nrather, DHS’s administrative arrests are used to place people immediate removal.  \n28 \n   39                               \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;  \nPETITION FOR HABEAS \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 27     Filed 06/11/25     PageID.218     Page 41\nof 42\n \n \n1  219. DHS’s warrantless courthouse arrests are not authorized by law, and the  \n2  arrests violate Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable \n3  government seizure and arrest.   \n4  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n5  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs-Petitioners pray for judgment as follows: \n6  A.

Grant the restoration of the individual merits hearing or asylum adjudication. \n14 \nE. Declare unlawful the Directive policy and/or practice they’re implementing \n15 \nto arrest and detain Petitioners without a hearing or due process; \n16 \nF. Declare  DHS’s  courthouse  arrest  policies  and  practices  are  in  excess  of \n17 \nDefendants’ statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations in violation of 5 \n18 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n19 \nG. Enjoin Defendants and all of their officers, employees, agents, and anyone in \n20 \nconcert  with  them,  from  implementing,  applying,  or  taking  any  action \n21 \nwhatsoever  under  the  DHS’s  courthouse  arrest  policies  and  from  civilly \n22 \narresting  parties,  witnesses,  and  others  attending,  being  present  at,  or \n23 \ndeparting from U.S. courthouses in the Southern District of California. \n24 \nH.

Petitioner-Plaintiff  (“Petitioner”)  A.M.1  is  a  Western  Sahara   \n3 \n(“Sahrawi”)  man  in  immigration  custody  in  danger  of  imminent  removal  from \n4 \nthe  United  States  (less  than  24  hour  notice)  – and  this  court  could  potentially \n5 \npermanently  lose  jurisdiction.    Petitioner  is  in  imminent  danger  of  being \n6 \ntransferred  outside  of  the  Southern  District  of  California  en  route  to  removal \n7 \nwithout  a  notice  to  appear  or  opportunity  to  be  heard  and  thus  request  an \n8 \ninjunction  on  any  transfer  out  of  the  Southern  District  of  California,  as  well  as \n9 \na  30-day  notice  of  any  intent  to  remove  Petitioners  and  the  opportunity  to \n10 \ncontest  any  alien  enemy  designation  or  allegation  against  him.     \n11 \n2.  A.M.  is  and  has  been  a  human  rights  defender  at  an  internationally   \n12 \nwell-respected  non-governmental  organization  that  has  presented  to  the  United \n13 \nNations,  European  Commission  of  Human  Rights  and  other  internationally \n14 \nrenowned  organizations  to  protect  life,  liberty,  and  democratic  freedoms.    \n15 \n3.    A.M.  has  not  been  advised  on  why  he  is  being  detained,  after  the  United   \n16 \nStates  government  withdrew  his  notice  to  appear  in  court.    He  complied  with  the \n17 \nrules,  notices,  and  appeared  at  his  court  date  to  present  and  assert  his  statutory \n18 \nrights  to  asylum.    Petitioner  was  summarily  arrested  as  he  exited  the  court  room \n19 \nafter  the  court  dismissed  his  case  upon  Respondents’  request,  despite  the  court \n20 \nnoting  A.M.’s  lawful  right  to  seek  asylum,  withholding  of  removal,  and/or \n21 \nconvention  against  torture  protections  under  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act.   \n22 \nA.M.  has  requested  a  credible  fear  interview  but  very  well  may  be  placed  on  a \n23 \nplane  to  El  Salvador,  Sudan,  or  back  to  the  country  where  he  fled  for  his  life  from \n24 \npersecution,  torture,  and  death  threats,  and  sought  fairness,  due  process  protection, \n25 \nand  the  rule  of  law  in  the  United  States.     \n26 \n \n27  1  Motion  for  these  Petitioners  to  proceed  under  pseudonym  is  concurrently  filed \nwith  this  petition  and  complaint.   \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       2                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.64     Page 3 of\n15\n \n \n1  4.  A.M.  and  others  are  being  subjected  to  expedited  removal  despite  stating \n2  a  valid  claim  for  asylum  and  credible  fear  of  persecution  the  Convention  against \n3  Torture.  The  agency’s  refusal  to  provide  a  meaningful  credible  fear  determination \n4  violates  procedural  due  process  and  statutory  rights  under  8  U.S.C.  §E1158  and  §E \n5  1231(b)(3)..   \n6  5.    Pursuant  to  Rule  65  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  and  the  All \n7  Writs  Act,  Petitioner  and  others  similarly  situated  hereby  apply  for  a  temporary  \t\nrestraining  order  against  Respondents-Defendants  (“Respondents”).    Petitioner  is  a \n8 \ncivil  immigration  detainee  who  is  at  substantial  risk  of  immediate,  summary \n9 \nremoval  from  the  United  States.   \n10 \n\t OVERVIEW \n11 \n6.  This  is  time-sensitive  and  urgent  because  the  current  U.S.  government  has   \n12 \nbeen  alleged  to  have  sent  asylum  seekers,  lawful  permanent  residents,  and  even \n13 \nU.S.  citizens  overseas  without  due  process,  and  have  not  been  able  to  retrieve  or \n14 \naccount  for  their  whereabouts.   \n15 \n7.  In  a  Proclamation  signed  on  March  14  and  published  on  March  15,  the   \n16 \nPresident  invoked  a  war  power,  the  Alien  Enemies  Act  of  1798  (“AEA”),  to \n17 \nsummarily  remove  noncitizens  from  the  U.S.  and  bypass  the  immigration  laws \n18 \nCongress  has  enacted.  See  Invocation  of  the  Alien  Enemies  Act  (Mar.  15,  2025)1 \n19 \n(“Proclamation”).  The  Proclamation  targets  Venezuelan  noncitizens  accused  of \n20 \nbeing  part  of  Tren  de  Aragua  (“TdA”),  a  criminal  gang.  On  the  evening  of  March \n21 \n15,  2025,  the  D.C.  District  Court  issued  an  order  temporarily  pausing  removals \n22 \npursuant  Proclamation  of  a  provisionally  certified  nationwide  class.  J.G.G.  v. \n23 \nTrump,  No.  25-5067,  2025  WL  914682,  at  *2  (D.C.  Cir.  Mar.  26,  2025).  That \n24 \norder  was  immediately  appealed  by  the  government,  but  the  court  of  appeals \n25 \ndenied  a  stay.  Id.   \n26 \n8.  On  April  7,  in  a  5-4  decision,  the  Supreme  Court  granted  the  government’s   \n27 \n  application  to  stay  the  order  on  the  basis  that  Petitioners  had  to  proceed  through \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       3                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.65     Page 4 of\n15\n \n \n1  habeas,  while  emphasizing  that  individuals  who  are  designated  under  the  AEA \n2  Proclamation  are  “entitle[d]  to  due  process”  and  notice  “within  a  reasonable  time \n3  and  in  such  manner  as  will  allow  them  to  actually  seek  habeas  relief”  before \n4  removal.  Trump  v.  J.G.G.,  No.  24A931,  2025  WL  102409  (U.S.  Apr.  7,  2025). \n5  9.  To  date,  the  government  has  not  indicated  the  type  of  notice  they  intend  to   \n6  provide  or  how  much  time  they  will  give  individuals  before  seeking  to  remove \n7  them  under  the  AEA.  However,  in  a  hearing  in  other  jurisdictions  in  the  Southern \nDistrict  of  Texas  on  Friday,  April  11,  the  government  said  they  had  not  ruled  out \n8 \nthe  possibility  that  individuals  will  receive  no  more  than  24  hours’  notice;  the \n9 \ngovernment  did  not  say  whether  it  was  considering  providing  even  less  than  24 \n10 \nhours.  In  light  of  the  Supreme  Court’s  ruling  that  challenges  to  the  Proclamation \n11 \nmust  be  brought  in  habeas,  Petitioners  file  this  action  on  behalf  of  Petitioner  in  his \n12 \ndistrict  of  confinement.    As  several  judges  have  already  found,  Petitioner  is  likely \n13 \nto  succeed  on  the  merits  of  his  challenge  and  he  is  at  imminent  risk  of  removal  to \n14 \nEl  Salvador,  where  more  than  100  individuals  have  been  sent,  Sudan,  or  back  to \n15 \nMorocco  where  he  will  likely  torture,  persecuted  or  killed.          \n16 \n10.  In  April  2025,  the  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  immigrants  even  under  the   \n17 \nAlien  Enemies  Act  are  entitled  to  advance  notice  of  their  removal  and  a \n18 \nmeaningful  opportunity  to  challenge  their  deportation  through  legal  avenues.       \n19 \n11.  At  or  about  end  of  May  of  2025,  Respondents  started  to  show  up   \n20 \nat  the  immigration  courts  at  valid  asylum  hearings  and  arrest  the  applicants  at their \n21 \ncourt  hearings  in  San  Diego,  at  or  about  880  Front  Street,  Edward  J.  Schwartz \n22 \nFederal  Building  and  U.S.  Courthouse,  and  stating  that  they  will  remove  those \n23 \napplicants  without  a  notice  to  appear  or  opportunity  to  be  heard.     \n24 \n12.  Petitioner  is  informed  and  believes  this  opaque  and  obfuscatory  policy  and   \n25 \npractice  is  denying  credible  claims  to  statutory  protections  and  subjecting  eligible \n26 \napplicants  with  colorable  claims  to  persecution,  torture,  or  death  against  United \n27 \nStates  and  international  law.   \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       4                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.66     Page 5 of\n15\n \n \n1  13.  Petitioner  is  advised  he  will  be  removed  without  his  due  process  rights. \n2  JURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n3  14.  This  Court  has  original  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  Federal   \n4  jurisdiction  exists  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1331  (federal  question)  and  28  U.S.C.   \n5  §  1343(a)(3)  and  (4)(civil  rights).  This  court  has  supplemental  jurisdiction  over \n6  Plaintiffs’  claims  arising  under  state  law  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.§  1367  (a)  because \n7  those  claims  are  so  related  to  the  federal  claims  that  they  form  part  of  the  same \ncase  or  controversy  under  Article  III  of  the  United  States  Constitution.    Plaintiffs \n8 \nbring  this  action  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  the  U.S.  Constitution. \n9 \nThis  case  arises  under  the  Alien  Enemies  Act  (“AEA”),  50  U.S.C.  §§  21-24;  the \n10 \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”),  8  U.S.C.  §  1101,  et  seq.  and  its \n11 \nimplementing  regulations;  the  Convention  Against  Torture  (“CAT”),  see  Foreign \n12 \nAffairs  Reform  and  Restructuring  Act  of  1998  (“FARRA”),  Pub.  L.  No.  105-277, \n13 \ndiv.  G,  Title  XXII,  §  2242,  112  Stat.  2681,  2681-822  (1998)  (codified  as  Note  to  8 \n14 \nU.S.C.  §  1231);  the  All  Writs  Act,  28  U.S.C.  §  1651,  and  the  Fifth  Amendment  to \n15 \nthe  U.S.  Constitution. \n16 \n15.  This  Court  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  §  2241  et  seq.   \n17 \n(habeas  corpus),  art.  I,  §  9,  cl.  2  of  the  U.S.  Constitution  (Suspension  Clause),  28 \n18 \nU.S.C.  §  1346  (United  States  as  defendant),  28  U.S.C.  §  1361  (mandamus),  and  28 \n19 \nU.S.C.  §  1651  (All  Writs  Act). \n20 \n16.  The  Court  may  grant  relief  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2241;  28  U.S.C.  § \n21 \n2243;   \n22 \nthe  Declaratory  Judgment  Act,  28  U.S.C.  §  2201  et  seq.;  the  All  Writs  Act,  28 \n23 \nU.S.C.  §  1651;  and  the  Court’s  inherent  equitable  powers. \n24 \n17.  Venue  is  proper  in  the  Southern  District  of  California  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.   \n25 \n§1391(b)(2)  because  a  substantial  part  of  the    events,  acts,  or  omissions  giving  rise \n26 \nto  the  claims  occurred  in  the  County  of  San  Diego  including  at  the  time  of  filing \n27 \nPetitioner  is  detained  in  the  Respondents’  custody,  in  the  Southern  District  of \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       5                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.67     Page 6 of\n15\n \n \n1  California;  Respondents  JASON  AGUILAR,  Chief  Counsel  for  Immigration  and \n2  Customs  Enforcement  San  Diego,  SIDNEY  AKI,  Director  of  Field  Operations,  San \n3  Diego  Field  Office  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  GREGORY  J. \n4  ARCHAMBEAULT,  are  believed  to  reside  in  this  district;  and  Respondents  are \n5  agencies  of  the  United  States  or  officers  of  the  United  States  Acting  in  their  official \n6  capacity.      \n7  PARTIES \n8  A.

Petitioner  is  a  35  year  Western  Sahrawi  man  who  has  been  a  human  rights   \n9 \nDefender  at  an  internationally  well-respected  non-governmental  organization  that \n10 \nhas  presented  to  the  United  Nations  and  European  Commission  of  Human  Rights \n11 \nwho  is  detained  at  the  Otay  Mesa  Facility  in  San  Diego  and  who,  having  been \n12 \nremoved,  is  at  imminent  risk  of  removal  under  the  Proclamation  and  current \n13 \npractices  that  the  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  has  been  deploying  in \n14 \nSan  Diego.   \n15 \n19.  A.M.  is  seeking  asylum  on  the  basis  of  his  political  views,  membership  in  a   \n16 \nsocial  group,  race-ethnicity  and  fear  of  harm,  persecution,  and  mistreatment  from \n17 \nthe  Moroccan  government  due  to  his  immutable  characteristics  and  human  rights \n18 \nactivism.     \n19 \n20.  A.M.  is  diabetic  and  has  medical  complications  due  to  past  persecution  and   \n20 \nrequires  access  to  daily  medications  and  consistent  medical  care.     \n21 \n21.  The  U.S.  government  has  publicly  stated  that  those  with  asylum  claims   \n22 \nwould  proceed  with  their  credible  fear  and  asylum  rights  as  a  matter  of  law.     \n23 \n22.  After  presenting  himself  for  his  asylum  hearing,  he  was  arrested  at  the   \n24 \ndowntown  Courthouse  on  June  3,  2025.        \n25 \n23.  He  fears  being  deported,  being  unable  to  speak  with  his  attorney,  being   \n26 \ndenied  adequate  medical  care,  and  being  sent  back  to  a  country  where  he  will  be \n27 \nimprisoned,  tortured,  and  likely  killed  by  the  Moroccan  police  since  they  have \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       6                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.68     Page 7 of\n15\n \n \n1  done  previously  to  him.    He  fears  that  the  Moroccan  authorities  will  target  him \n2  because  of  his  political  opinion,  because  he  and  his  family  are  known  human  rights \n3  activists,  and  he  was  a  well  known  national  champion  who  refused  to  promote  the \n4  government  on  a  national  stage.            \n5  24.  The  government  did  not  provide  notice  or  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  on \n6  why   \n7  he  is  being  detained  but  rather  plans  to  ship  him  overseas  and  out  of  this \njurisdiction  without  any  due  process  rights.   \n8 \n25.  Plaintiff-Petitioner  DOES  1-100  are  others  who  were  similarly  arrested  at   \n9 \nthe  downtown  courthouse,  880  Front  Street,  deprived  of  their  credible  fear \n10 \ninterviews,  and  are  at  risk  of  being  sent  on  an  airplane  out  of  the  jurisdiction  or \n11 \ncountry  without  an  opportunity  to  access  or  speak  with  an  attorney  despite  their \n12 \ncredible  fear  claims.     \n13 \nB.

Respondent  SIDNEY  AKI,  Director  of  Field  Operations,  San  Diego  Field   \n11 \nOffice  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection.  Respondent  Aki  is  responsible  for  the \n12 \nOffice  of  the  Principal  Legal  Advisor  (OPLA)  and  ICE’s  policies,  practices,  and \n13 \nprocedures,  including  those  relating  to  the  detention  of  immigrants  during  their \n14 \nremoval  procedures.  Respondent  Aki  is  a  legal  custodian  of  Petitioners. \n15 \nRespondent  Aki  is  sued  in  his  official  capacity. \n16 \n33.  Respondent  GREGORY  J.

Respondent  CORE  CIVIC  is  the  private  prison  company,  believed  to  earn   \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       8                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.70     Page 9 of\n15\n \n \n1  multi-millions  of  dollars  at  the  private  detention  at  the  Otay  Mesa  Detention \n2  Center.   Core  Civic  is  a  legal  custodian  of  petitioners.           \n3  36.  Plaintiff  is  informed  and  believes  there  are  other  Respondents  DOES  1   \n4  through  20,  who  are  responsible  for  the  Office  of  the  Principal  Legal  Advisor \n5  (OPLA)  and  ICE’s  policies,  practices,  and  procedures,  including  those  relating  to \n6  the  detention  of  immigrants  during  their  removal  procedures  against  their  due \n7  process  rights. \n8  C. Other  Aggrieved  Plaintiffs-Petitioners   \n37.  Petitioner  brings  this  action  under  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a)   \n9 \nand  23(b)(2)  on  behalf  himself  and  as  an  emergency  injunctive  relief  claim  to \n10 \npreserve  the  rights  of  all  other  persons  similarly  situated  who  have  been  arrested  or \n11 \ndetained  for  appearing  at  their  court  hearings,  deprived  the  right  of  speaking  to  an \n12 \nattorney  and  are  being  subjected  to  be  sent  overseas  without  notice  or  an \n13 \nopportunity  to  be  heard  on  their  credible  fear  claims  in  the  Southern  District  Court \n14 \nof  California.  There’s  commonality,  typicality,  adequacy,  and  numerosity.    The \n15 \nmembers  are  subject  to  a  common  practice:  summary  removal  under  the \n16 \nProclamation  contrary  to  the  AEA,  INA,  and  the  statutory  protections  Congress  has \n17 \nenacted.    The  suit  also  raises  questions  of  law  common  to  members  of  the  proposed \n18 \nclass,  including  whether  the  Proclamation  and  its  implementation  violate  the  AEA, \n19 \nthe  INA,  and  the  statutory  protections  for  asylum  seekers.    This  is  filed  to  prevent \n20 \nthe  irreparable  harm  in  which  the  detained  will  incur  if  they  are  sent  overseas \n21 \nwithout  a  notice  and  opportunity  to  be  heard.  The  proposed  class  also  satisfies  Rule \n22 \n23(b)(2).    Respondents  have  acted  (or  will  act)  on  grounds  generally  applicable  to \n23 \nthe  class  by  subjecting  them  to  summary  removal  under  the  Proclamation  rather \n24 \nthan  affording  them  the  protection  of  immigration  laws.    Injunctive  and  declaratory \n25 \nrelief  is  therefore  appropriate  with  respect  to  the  whole.     \n26 \nCAUSES  OF  ACTION \n27 \nFIRST  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       9                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.71     Page 10 of\n15\n \n \n1  Ultra  Vires,  Violation  of  50  U.S.C.  §  21,  et  seq.   \n2  (All  Respondents) \n3  38.    All  of  the  foregoing  allegations  are  repeated  and  realleged  as  if  fully  set   \n4  forth  herein.     \n5  39.  The  government  has  not  provided  an  explanation  for  its  actions  or  the   \n6  appliable  law.    Notably,  it  has  alluded  to  the  AEA,  which    does  not  authorize  the \n7  removal  of  noncitizens  from  the  United  States  absent  a  “declared  war”  or  a \n“perpetrated,  attempted,  or  threatened”  “invasion  or  predatory  incursion”  into  the \n8 \nUnited  States  by  a  “foreign  nation  or  government.”  See  50  U.S.C.  §  21.  The \n9 \nProclamation  on  its  face  mandates  Petitioners’  removal  under  the  AEA  where \n10 \nthose  preconditions  have  not  been  met. \n11 \n40.  The  AEA  Process,  which  was  purportedly  established  pursuant  to  the   \n12 \nauthority  of  50  U.S.C.  §  21,  is  not  authorized  by  that  law. \n13 \n41.  The  AEA  (Section  21)  permits  removal  only  where  noncitizens  alleged  to   \n14 \nbe  “alien  enemies”  “refuse  or  neglect  to  depart”  from  the  United  States.  50  U.S.C. \n15 \n§  21.  The  AEA  (Section  22)  also  requires  the  government  to  afford  noncitizens \n16 \nalleged  to  be  “alien  enemies”  sufficient  time  to  settle  their  affairs  and  to  depart  the \n17 \nUnited  States.  See  50  U.S.C.  §  22. \n18 \n42.  However,  Petitioners  are  being  subject  to  forced  removal  without  being   \n19 \nafforded  the  privilege  of  voluntary  departure,  let  alone  any  notice  or  an  opportunity \n20 \nto  respond  to  the  designation  of  alien  enemy. \n21 \n43.  The  application  of  the  AEA  and/or  unstated  process  to  Petitioners  is   \n22 \ntherefore  ultra  vires.   \n23 \nSECOND  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n24 \nViolation  of  8  U.S.C.  §  1101,  et  seq. \n25 \n(All  Respondents) \n26 \n44.  All  of  the  foregoing  allegations  are  repeated  and  realleged  as  if  fully  set   \n27 \nForth  herein. \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       10                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.72     Page 11 of\n15\n \n \n1  45.  The  INA,  8  U.S.C.  §  1101,  et  seq.,  sets  out  the  sole  mechanisms  established   \n2  By  Congress  for  the  removal  of  noncitizens. \n3  46.  The  INA  provides  that  a  removal  proceeding  before  an  immigration  judge   \n4  under  8  U.S.C.  §  1229a  is  “the  sole  and  exclusive  procedure”  by  which  the \n5  government  may  determine  whether  to  remove  an  individual,  “[u]nless  otherwise \n6  specified”  in  the  INA.  8  U.S.C.  §  1229a(a)(3). \n7  47.  The  AEA  Process  creates  an  alternative  removal  mechanism  outside  of  the \nimmigration  laws  set  forth  by  Congress  in  Title  8. \n8 \n48.  The  INA’s  “exclusive  procedure”  and  statutory  protections  apply  to  any   \n9 \nremoval  of  a  noncitizen  from  the  United  States,  including  removals  authorized  by \n10 \nthe  AEA.  Because  the  AEA  Process  provides  for  the  removal  of  Petitioners \n11 \nwithout  the  procedures  specified  in  the  INA,  it  violates  8  U.S.C.  §  1229a  and  the \n12 \nINA. \n13 \n49.  As  a  result,  the  application  of  the  AEA  to  Petitioners,  which  will  result  in   \n14 \ntheir  removal  from  the  United  States,  is  contrary  to  law. \n15 \nTHIRD  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n16 \nViolation  of  8  U.S.C.  §  1158,  Asylum \n17 \n(All  Respondents) \n18 \n50.  All  of  the  foregoing  allegations  are  repeated  and  realleged  as  if  fully  set   \n19 \nforth  herein.     \n20 \n51.  The  INA  provides,  with  certain  exceptions,  that  “[a]ny  alien  who  is   \n21 \nphysically  present  in  the  United  States  or  who  arrives  in  the  United  States  (whether \n22 \nor  not  at  a  designated  port  of  arrival  and  including  an  alien  who  is  brought  to  the \n23 \nUnited  States  after  having  been  interdicted  in  international  or  United  States \n24 \nwaters),  irrespective  of  such  alien’s  status,  may  apply  for  asylum  in  accordance \n25 \nwith  this  section  or,  where  applicable,  section  1225(b)  of  this  title.”  8 \n26 \nU.S.C.  §  1158(a)(1). \n27 \n52.  Respondents’  application  of  the  AEA  Process  to  Petitioners  prevents  them   \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       11                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.73     Page 12 of\n15\n \n \n1  from  applying  for  asylum  in  accordance  with  8  U.S.C.  §  1158(a)(1),  and  is \n2  therefore  contrary  to  law. \n3  /// \n4  /// \n5  FOURTH  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n6  Violation  of  8  U.S.C.  §  1231(b)(3),  Withholding  of  Removal \n7  (All  Respondents) \n53.  Plaintiffs  reallege  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this  complaint  and  incorporate  the   \n8 \nsame  herein  by  this  reference  as  if  fully  set  below. \n9 \n54.  All  of  the  foregoing  allegations  are  repeated  and  realleged  as  if  fully  set   \n10 \nforth  herein. \n11 \n55.  The  “withholding  of  removal”  statute,  INA  §  241(b)(3),  codified  at  8   \n12 \nU.S.C.  §  1231(b)(3),  bars  the  removal  of  noncitizens  to  a  country  where  it  is  more \n13 \nlikely  than  not  that  they  would  face  persecution. \n14 \n56.  Respondents’  AEA  Process  violates  the  withholding  of  removal  statute   \n15 \nbecause  it  does  not  provide  adequate  safeguards  to  ensure  that  Petitioners  are  not \n16 \nreturned  to  a  country  where  it  is  more  likely  than  not  they  would  face  persecution. \n17 \nAccordingly,  Respondents’  actions  against  Petitioners  are  contrary  to  law. \n18 \nFIFTH  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n19 \nViolation  of  the  Foreign  Affairs  Reform  and  Restructuring  Act  of  1998 \n20 \n(“FARRA”)  codified  at  8  U.S.C.  §  1231  note \n21 \nConvention  Against  Torture \n22 \n(All  Respondents) \n23 \n57.    Plaintiffs  realleges  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this  complaint  and  incorporate \n24 \nthe  same  herein  by  this  reference. \n25 \n58.  The  United  States  is  bound  by  the  United  Nations  Convention  Against   \n26 \n27 \n   \n28 \n \n                                                                       12                               \nPETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 15     Filed 06/06/25     PageID.74     Page 13 of\n15\n \n \n1  Torture  and  Other  Cruel,  Inhuman  or  Degrading  Treatment  or  Punishment \n2  (“CAT”),  which  prohibits  returning  any  individual  to  a  country  where  it  is  more \n3  likely  than  not  that  they  would  be  subjected  to  torture. \n4  59.  Article  3  of  the  CAT,  as  implemented  by  the  Foreign  Affairs  Reform  and   \n5  Restructuring  Act  of  1998  (FARRA),  and  its  regulations  at  8  C.F.R.  §  208.16–18, \n6  require  that  no  person  be  removed  to  a  country  where  they  are  likely  to  face  torture \n7  at  the  hands  of  the  government  or  with  its  acquiescence. \n8  60.  Petitioner  has  expressed  a  credible  and  well-supported  fear  of  torture  upon   \nreturn  to  [Country],  supported  by  evidence  including  country  conditions, \n9 \nmedical/psychological  documentation,  affidavits,  and  testimony. \n10 \nSIXTH  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n11 \nUltra  Vires,  Violation  of  50  U.S.C.  §  22 \n12 \n(All  Respondents) \n13 \n61.  All  of  the  foregoing  allegations  are  repeated  and  realleged  as  if  fully  set   \n14 \nForth  herein. \n15 \n62.  The  AEA  requires  that  noncitizens  whose  removal  is  authorized  by  the   \n16 \nAEA,  unless  “chargeable  with  actual  hostility,  or  other  crime  against  the  public \n17 \nsafety,”  be  allowed  the  full  time  stipulated  by  treaty  to  depart  or  a  reasonable  time \n18 \nin  which  to  settle  their  affairs  before  departing.  See  50  U.S.C.  §  22.  The \n19 \nProclamation  on  its  face  denies  Petitioners  any  time  under  Section  22  to  settle  their \n20 \naffairs,  because  it  declares  everyone  subject  to  the  Proclamation  to  be  “chargeable \n21 \nwith  actual  hostility”  and  to  be  a  “danger  to  public  safety.” \n22 \n63.  The  AEA  Process  thus  contravenes  50  U.S.C.  §  22  and  is  ultra  vires. \n23 \nSEVENTH  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n24 \nViolation  of  Due  Process  Under  the  Fifth  Amendment \n25 \n(All  Respondents) \n26 \n85.

This case arises out of the sweeping immigration enforcement actions that  \nthe government began unannounced at the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Building \n8 \nand Courthouse in the Southern District of California. As a part of an official \n9 \nmemo, Respondents, including leadership and agents of the U.S. Immigration and \n10 \nCustom Enforcement, planned to and did arrest noncitizens, detaining them at the \n11 \ncourthouse  without  notice  or  an  opportunity  to  be  heard,  set  for  immediate \n12 \nexpulsion from the United States at an unprecedented speed.   \n13 \n2.  Petitioner respectfully seeks the court enjoin the abusive, overly broad, and  \n14 \nharassing  practice  of  using  the  courthouses  to  conduct  civil  courthouse  arrests \n15 \nwithout  a  bench  warrant,  impose  indefinite  ‘mandatory’  detention,  and  forced \n16 \nremoval without due process as asylum seekers and other noncitizens lawfully \n17 \nappear for their mandated courtroom appearances.   \n18 \n3.  DHS’s actions reflect the recent unparalleled levels of practices that violate  \n19 \nthe immigration laws, statutory law, foreign treatises, and the U.S. Constitution.   \n20 \n4.  Defendant-Respondents’ current practice of (i) the overzealous  \n21 \ncourthouse  arrests  of  anyone  whom  the  government  has  “information  that \n22 \nbelieves the target…will be at a specific location” like the federal building and \n23 \nU.S. courthouse, (ii) deprivation of due process in detaining applicants who are \n24 \nlawfully asserting their rights to seek asylum, (iii) unlawful policy, practice, or \n25 \nconduct of revoking the notice to appear to place into immediate removal and \n26 \ndeprive noncitizens and asylum seekers of due process, has a profound chilling \n27 \neffect on the fundamental pillars of the rule of law, access to the courts, and access \n28 \n     1                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.101     Page 3 of\n37\n \n \n1  to justice. This unlawful government behavior of courthouse arrests was enjoined \n2  in Elizeo Velazquez-Hernandez, et al., v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enf’t, et \n3  al.,  No.  3:20-CV-2060  (DMS)(KSC),  2020  WL  6712223  (S.D.  Cal.  Nov.  16, \n4  2020). Courts1 have similarly prohibited this conduct.  \n5  5.  Respondents’ actions violate their own memos, the constitution and  \n6  statutory protections. On or about May 27, 2025, Respondents revoked its own \n7  rules without notice that prohibited arrests at or within the courthouses but also \nhave not followed its own updated policy guidance. The expansive quotas under \n8 \nthe ICE Directive Enforcement Actions have incentivized improper actions in or \n9 \nnear  Courthouses.  The  most  recent  policy,  practice,  or  conduct  in  San  Diego \n10 \nbelieved based on the Interim Guidance: Civil Immigration Enforcement Actions in \n11 \nor near Courthouses (May 27, 2025), replacing the January 21, 2025 Directive and the \n12 \nhas unlawfully applied an overly broad interpretation, arbitrary and capricious \n13 \npractice, and complete rules reversal emboldening ICE officers or agents to \n14 \nconduct  unfettered  civil  immigration  enforcement  actions  in  or  near \n15 \ncourthouses when they believe the targeted [noncitizen] is or will be present at a \n16 \nspecific location” and patently ignores the previous directive “where such action is \n17 \nnot precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction” or the agency’s own published \n18 \ninstructions that they will refrain entirely due to the irreparable damage.  \n19 \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n20 \n6.  Petitioner-Plaintiff (“Petitioner”) A.M. is and has been a human right  \n21 \ndefender  and  leader  at  a  well-acclaimed  international  non-governmental \n22 \norganization and has contributed to critical reporting to the United Nations, \n23 \n \n24 \n1 See, e.g., Ryan v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 467 F. Supp. 3d 228 (D. Mass. 2020); \nState of New York v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, No. 19-cv-8876, 2020 WL 2117584 \n25 \n(S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2020); Liu v. Chertoff, No. C07-2566, 2007 WL 1211290 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 23, \n26  2007) (injunction issued to limit ICE arrests at courthouses to protect access to immigration \nhearings); Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 (2009) (recognizing the importance of fair process in \n27 \nimmigration hearings). \n \n28 \n     2                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.102     Page 4 of\n37\n \n \n1  European Commission on Human Rights, Cornell Law School Legal Clinic, \n2  Robert Kennedy Human Rights, and global organizations.   \n3  7.  A.M. complied with the rules, notices, and appeared in court prepared  \n4  to present his lawful claim to asylum under the law at his scheduled individual \n5  merits hearing on June 3, 2025.    \n6  8.  A.M. was finally eligible to apply for work authorization with the  \n7  Employment Authorization Document (EAD)(Form I-765); his asylum clock had \nbeen tolled for A.M. to seek representation and had fully prepared his case over the \n8 \ncourse of nearly five hundred (500) days.   \n9 \n9.  Petitioner’s witnesses were prepared to testify from overseas that day  \n10 \neven in spite of recent hospitalization and unknown availability due to his \n11 \nhealth at later date.  \n12 \n10.  Petitioner is informed and believes he could hear ICE agents by the door \n13 \nthroughout  the  hearing  and  could  see  them  upon  entering  and  exiting. \n14 \nPetitioner was summarily arrested as he stepped out of the courtroom within the \n15 \nEdward J. Schwartz building once the immigration judge dismissed his case upon \n16 \nthe U.S. government’s request, and in spite of the court acknowledging A.M. has a \n17 \nlawful right to seek asylum, withholding of removal, and/or convention against \n18 \ntorture protections under the Immigration and Nationality Act.   \n19 \n11.  Petitioner is informed that Respondents knew or should have known that \n20 \nthis deprivation of the notice and right to be heard was an overt intentional tactic \n21 \nand policy abuse to prevent the adjudication of a strong asylum claim and remove \n22 \nA.M. without due process forcing him into terrifying and ambiguous proceedings \n23 \nof immediate removal or indefinite detention when he had been fully compliant.  \n24 \n12.  A provisionary class member entered in November 2023, was released into  \n25 \nthe community after a Notice to Appear, was arrested on or about May 22, after \n26 \nDHS  moved  to  dismiss  his  proceedings  and  the  Immigration  Judge  dismissed \n27 \ndespite counsel’s request for a continuance.   \n28 \n     3                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.103     Page 5 of\n37\n \n \n1  13.  Plaintiff is informed and believes that an estimated 10 to 12 similar arrests  \n2  occurred  daily,  with  others  subjected  to  a  chaotic  detention  within  the  federal \n3  building and courthouse.   \n4  14.  Plaintiff is informed and believes there are other similarly situated  \n5  situated  applicants  who  don’t  speak  English  fluently,  detained  at  their  court \n6  hearings, have not been able to access counsel and seek protections and relief with \n7  an emergency stay of removal, to be able to access their rights and counsel.     \nA. Federal Building-Courthouse Arrests - Habeas Corpus and Due Process \n8 \n15.  In recent statements, behavior, and practice, Respondents-Defendants have  \n9 \ndemonstrated little interest or regard for adhering to the America’s foundational \n10 \nand bedrock principles of due process, habeas corpus, and rule of law. Recently, on \n11 \nor  about  May  20,  2025,  at  her  confirmation  hearing,  Respondent-Defendant \n12 \nKRISTI NOEM2 erroneously responds: \"Habeas corpus is a constitutional right \n13 \nthat the president has to be able to remove people from this country”.  \n14 \n16.  Here, in San Diego, A.M. who presented himself lawfully for his asylum  \n15 \nhearing was separated from his attorney and upon is informed and believes, not \n16 \nclearly advised on why he is being detained or explained the process protecting his \n17 \nprocedural and substantive due process rights, after the United States government \n18 \nwithdrew his notice to appear in court to terminate his asylum case.  Respondents’ \n19 \nagents could not advise on the process, next steps or ensure protections. \n20 \n17.  Respondents stated ICE is not granting any requests for stays of removal. \n21 \n18.  Notably, Respondents-Defendants’ agents were confused, unclear, and  \n22 \nunfamiliar on the process, next steps, or information on Petitioner, and could not \n23 \nprovide any policies or protections that his rights are preserved as a matter of law.   \n24 \n19.  Plaintiff is informed and believes hours of independent research to discover  \n25 \n26   \n2 See Testimony of Kristi Noem, Dep’t of Homeland Sec. (May 20, 2025), available at  \n27 \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/videos/ce8113z7k17o; https://www.c-\nspan.org/classroom/document/?23993 \n28 \n     4                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.104     Page 6 of\n37\n \n \n1  that Respondents shifted the protections from the Mayorkas memo and reverted to \n2  refusing  to  recognize  courthouses  as  “Sensitive  Locations”  and  maintains  that \n3  Respondents in the San Diego Field Office leadership in particular “The Assistant \n4  Field  Office  Director  and  Assistant  Special  Agents  in  Charge”  possesses  full \n5  authority and discretion to civilly arrest individuals in and around any courthouse.  \n6  20.  The courthouse arrest policy purports to re-vest ICE with the  \n7  unbridled  and  boundless  discretion  to  make  civil  arrests  in  and  around \n8  virtually any courthouse location when the U.S. Government deems a person \n9  is an “alien” at a specified location.  \n10  21.  Respondents-Defendants have not stated or provided this DHS policy. \n11  22.  Respondent’s newly enacted policies, practices, and procedures fail to  \n12  account for significant issues, including the historic sanctity of courthouses and the \n13  chilling impact the policies have on the people released on bond by a federal court.   \n14  23.  Shortly after taking office, the President issued ICE Directive Enforcement  \n15  Actions in or Near Courthouses (Jan. 21, 2025) DHS Directive Enforcement Actions in \n16  or Near Protected Areas (Jan. 20, 2025) and where such action is not precluded by \n17  laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action \nwill take place.3 The new memorandum supersedes the Mayorkas memorandum \n18 \nentitled ‘Guidelines for Enforcement Actions in or Near Protected Areas’ (October \n19 \n27, 2021), replacing with ICE Policy No. 11072.4 Interim Guidance: Civil \n20 \nImmigration Enforcement Actions in or near Courthouses. (May 27, 2025). Id.  \n21 \n24.  Ultimately, the courthouse arrest policy simply formalizes aspects of  \n22 \nDirective or unknown instructions, which vest ICE with unfettered discretion \n23 \nto  use  courthouses  as  a  trap  to  arrest  anyone  they  suspect  of  being  a \n24 \nnoncitizen at any location —including asylum seekers who are honoring their \n25 \n26   \n3  See Memorandum on ICE Directive Enforcement Actions in or Near Courthouses (Jan. 21, 2025); \n27 \nDHS Directive Enforcement Actions in or Near Protected Areas (Jan. 20, 2025);  Interim Guidance: \nCivil Immigration Enforcement Actions in or near Courthouses (May 27, 2025). \n28 \n     5                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.105     Page 7 of\n37\n \n \n1  conditions and mandates imposed by Respondents.  \n2  25.  With these Directives and memos, the President abandoned past  \n3  programs and protections and called for the deportation of anyone potentially \n4  removable, i.e. lawful green card holders, parolees, and in practice, asylum \n5  seekers--- with published mandatory quotas of 3,000 daily removals in \n6  disregard of the fundamental principles of due process. \n7  26.  Despite widespread opposition to this practice, Respondents have not  \nonly refused to stop it but has issued official policies authorizing civil \n8 \ncourthouse arrests. DHS’s courthouse arrest policies, and its extensive \n9 \npractice of conducting civil arrests at asylum hearings, are unprecedented in \n10 \nUnited States history.   \n11 \n27.  At the same time, Respondents have prohibited that the use of Web Ex or  \n12 \nvirtual appearances by Plaintiffs-Petitioners and required that asylum seekers \n13 \nappear physically in person in the federal immigration court.  \n14 \n28.  DHS has made clear that anyone who is subject to arrest by DHS may be  \n15 \narrested in the courthouse, and courthouse arrests are not limited to defendants in \n16 \ncriminal matters – the arrests are of asylum seekers, witnesses, or anyone DHS \n17 \nbelieves is a “targeted alien…” who is or will be present at a specific location.”   \n18 \n29.  Curiously enough, the updated memo expressly provides, “ICE officers  \n19 \nshould generally avoid enforcement near non-criminal or specialized courts. \n20 \n30.  Petitioners-Plaintiffs have complained of overzealous, aggressive arrests,  \n21 \nno notice, and chaotic scenes in which the public were refused entry or deterred \n22 \nfrom asserting their lawful rights in the federal building and courthouse. \n23 \n31.  To be clear, Respondents-Defendants have already had Plaintiffs in custody  \n24 \nand processed their biometrics and backgrounds, including all information \n25 \nnecessary for civil immigration enforcement purposes. They have no interest or \n26 \nneed in re-arrest for those reasons. Respondents’ only interest is to keep Plaintiffs \n27 \nincarcerated or removed expeditiously from the country  \n28 \n     6                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.106     Page 8 of\n37\n \n \n1  32.  Plaintiffs-Petitioners have established that their incarceration is not \n2  required for their immigration cases, as they reliably appeared for court hearings.  \n3  Common Law and Constitutional protections \n4  33.  ICE practices are interfering with the public’s access to the federal building  \n5  and the courthouses. In addition to deviating from prior policy, the U.S. Supreme \n6  Court long ago recognized a privilege against civil arrests for those attending \n7  court on official business—a privilege that traces its roots back to English \ncommon law and rests on the common-sense principle that the judicial system \n8 \ncannot function if parties and witnesses fear that their appearance in court \n9 \nwill be used as a trap. \n10 \n34.  DHS’s decision to flout the long-standing common-law privilege against  \n11 \ncivil courthouse arrests and to commandeer the courtrooms of the Southern District \n12 \nof California for federal civil immigration purposes has led Plaintiffs to reasonably \n13 \nfear civil arrest should they appear in court at their upcoming court dates. They \n14 \nknow that when their case ends, an immigration agent lurking in the courtroom \n15 \nwill be ready to civilly arrest them and place them in removal proceedings. DHS’s \n16 \npolicy to civilly arrest them in court following the conclusion of their misdemeanor \n17 \nprosecutions forces the Petitioners-Plaintiffs to choose between coming to court as \n18 \nordered and exercising their common-law right to be free from civil arrest in court. \n19 \n35.  In addition to the Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ own fear of civil arrest, the First,  \n20 \nFifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to receive equal protection and \n21 \npresent witnesses and to a public trial are violated because the policy instills fear in \n22 \npotential witnesses and court observers who have reason to fear civil arrest at or \n23 \nabout the Edward J. Schwartz federal building and U.S. courthouse. \n24 \n36.  DHS’s civil-courthouse-arrest policies not only undermine the  \n25 \nAdministration of Justice, they are also illegal for at least four reasons. \n26 \n37.  First, DHS’s courthouse arrest policies are arbitrary and capricious in  \n27 \n28 \n     7                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.107     Page 9 of\n37\n \n \n1  violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) because the policies are \n2  insufficiently explained, fail to consider all relevant factors, and depart from prior \n3  policy  without  reasoned  explanation.  Further,  DHS’s  implementation  of  the \n4  policies is inconsistent. ICE’s policy states that arrests will take place “inside” the \n5  courthouses or at “non-public entrances and exits,” but arrests do not always take \n6  place inside the courthouse. For example, officers chased a client and his lawyer \n7  down  Broadway  Street  adjacent  to  the  courthouse  and  arrested  the  client.  The \n8  lawyer asked the officers to identify themselves and to produce a warrant, and the \n9  officers refused and further ordered the lawyer to back away under threat of arrest \n10  if he did not cooperate. ICE arrests outside of a courthouse are an arbitrary and \n11  capricious application of its policy. See Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \n12  Sec., No. C19-2043 TSZ, 2020 WL 1819837, at *26–27 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 10, \n13  2020)  (ruling  that  ICE’s  practice  of  arresting  immigrants  outside  courthouses, \n14  instead of inside as the policy states, presents a plausible claim that the policy is \n15  arbitrary and capricious under the APA). \n16  38.  Second, Congress never authorized DHS to conduct civil courthouse arrests  \n17  because  it  never  abrogated  the  longstanding  and  well-settled  common-law \n18  privilege  against  such  arrests.  The  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  the \n19  common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests is “well settled.” Stewart v. \n20  Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 129 (1916). When Congress acts in an area governed by \n21  “long-established and familiar” common-law principles, Congress is presumed to \n22  retain those principles. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534 (1993). Here, \n23  where Congress granted the federal government a general civil-arrest power to \n24  enforce  civil  immigration  laws,  Congress  retained  traditional  common-law \n25  limitations  on  that  arrest  power—including  that  such  arrests  cannot  be  made \n26  against parties and witnesses attending court on official business. Because the INA \n27  does not grant the federal government authority to conduct civil courthouse arrests \n28 \n     8                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.108     Page 10\nof 37\n \n \n1  in violation of the common-law privilege, DHS’s policies authorizing such arrests, \n2  and its policies to conduct such arrests, exceed DHS’s statutory authority and must \n3  be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n4  39.  Third, DHS’s policies violate the Constitutional right of access to the  \n5  courts,  which  prohibits  “systemic  official  action  [that]  frustrates  a  plaintiff  or \n6  plaintiff class in preparing and filing suits.” Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, \n7  413, 415 & n.12 (2002). Conditioning litigants’ ability to access the courts on \n8  risking  civil  arrest  creates  precisely  such  impermissible  frustration.  Indeed, \n9  common-law courts created the privilege against civil courthouse arrest to prevent \n10  the intolerable chilling effect of such arrests, explaining that the fear of arrest \n11  would “prevent [parties and witnesses’] approach,” obstructing “the administration \n12  of justice.”  Halsey v. Stewart, 4 N.J.L. 366, 368 (N.J. 1817). Plaintiffs found, \n13  however,  that  if  they  come  to  court  as  ordered  they  face  the  specter  of  civil \n14  courthouse arrest whether they win or lose their case.  \n15  40.  Fourth, DHS conducts the civil courthouse arrests without a judicial \n16  warrant authorizing the arrests as required by law. 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2). Pursuant \nto  section  1357(a)(2),  DHS  must  have  “reason  to  believe”  that  the  arrestee  is \n17 \nviolating immigration law and that the arrestee is “likely to escape before a warrant \n18 \ncan  be  obtained.  .  .  .”  But  Petitioners-Plaintiffs  consistent  appearance  at  court \n19 \ndemonstrates otherwise. DHS could have sought a warrant in the months while \n20 \nPlaintiffs’ cases were pending.  DHS did not. Failure to obtain a warrant during the \n21 \npendency of the cases is the product of indolence, not necessity, and it violates \n22 \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs’ statutory and constitutional rights.  \n23 \n41.  For these reasons, and as set forth below, Plaintiffs ask this Court to  \n24 \ndeclare that DHS’s policies authorizing civil arrests in the U.S. courthouses of \n25  the Southern District of California are unlawful, to declare that DHS’s \n26  current practices and tactics including failing to obtain a warrant and \n27  courthouse arrests is illegal, and to enjoin DHS from such activity.  \n28 \n     9                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.109     Page 11\nof 37\n \n \nThe common-law privilege against civil arrest \n1 \n42.  The common-law privilege against civil arrest while attending court on  \n2 \nofficial business is longstanding, tracing its origins back at least to the English \n3 \ncourts in the eighteenth century. \n4 \n43.  In England, and in the early years of this country, civil arrest, or civil  \n5 \ncapias, was a common means for initiating civil proceedings. See Nathan Levy, Jr., \n6 \nMesne Process in Personal Actions at Common Law and the Power Doctrine, 78 \n7 \nYale L.J. 52, 61-70 (1968). The possibility that such civil arrests could take place \n8 \nin court, however, posed a significant problem for the judiciary: If a party or \n9 \nwitness’s appearance in a case could be used as a trap for a civil arrest in another \n10 \ncase, many parties and witnesses would not attend court. To avoid this problem, \n11 \ncourts both in England and the United States—including the U.S. Supreme \n12 \nCourt—recognized and strictly enforced an “inflexib[le]” privilege against the civil \n13 \narrest of parties or witnesses attending court. Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. \n14 \n446, 448 (1923). As the Supreme Court explained, “the due administration of \n15 \njustice requires that a court shall not permit interference with the progress of a case \n16 \npending before it, by the service of process in other suits, which would prevent, or \n17 \nthe fear of which might tend to discourage, the voluntary attendance of those \n18 \nwhose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial administration in the \n19 \npending litigation.” Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222, 225 (1932). \n20 \n44.  The common-law privilege against civil arrest while attending court on  \n21 \nofficial business is longstanding, tracing its origins back at least to English courts \n22 \nin the eighteenth century. Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England \n23 \nexplained  the  common-law  rule  that  “[s]uitors,  witnesses,  and  other  persons, \n24 \nnecessarily attending any courts of record upon business, are not to be arrested \n25 \nduring  their  actual  attendance,  which  includes  their  necessary  coming  and \n26 \nreturning.”  3  William  Blackstone,  Commentaries  on  the  Laws  of  England  289 \n27 \n28 \n     10                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.110     Page 12\nof 37\n \n \n1  (1769); see also 6 Matthew Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 530 (London, A. \n2  Strahan, 7th ed. 1832) (“[A]ll [] persons whatsoever, are freed from arrests so long \n3  as they are in view of any of the courts at Westminster, or if near the courts, though \n4  out of view, lest any disturbance may be occasioned to the courts or any violence \n5  used.”). This principle was repeatedly endorsed by the English courts, which held \n6  that, “for the purpose of justice,” and “to encourage witnesses to come forward \n7  voluntarily,”  they  are  privileged  from  arrest  “in  coming,  in  staying,  and  in \n8  returning”. The King v. Holy Trinity in Wareham, 99 Eng. Rep. 531 (1782); see \n9  also Meekins v. Smith, 126 Eng. Rep. 363 (1791) (“[A]ll persons who had relation \n10  to a suit which called for their attendance, whether they were compelled to attend \n11  by process or not, (in which bail were included,) were [e]ntitled to privilege from \n12  arrest eundo et redundo, provided they came bona fide.”); Spence v. Stuart, 102 \n13  Eng. Rep. 530 (1802); Ex Parte Byne, 35 Eng. Rep. 123 (1813). \n14  45.  The U.S. Supreme Court adopted this privilege and held that it bars service  \n15  of  any  other  civil  process  while  attending  court.  For  instance,  in  Stewart  v. \n16  Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128 (1916), the Court described the privilege as “well settled,” \n17  explaining that a litigant “should be permitted to approach [the courts], not only \n18  without subjecting himself to evil, but even free from the fear of molestation or \n19  hindrance. He should also be enabled to procure, without difficulty, the attendance \n20  of all such persons as are necessary to manifest his rights.” Id. at 129. The Court \n21  described it as particularly firmly established that there was an “exemption from \n22  arrest,” or “capias,” and held that this exemption applied to any civil process to \n23  protect  the  “necessities  of  the  judicial  administration,  which  would  be  often \n24  embarrassed, and sometimes interrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with process \n25  while attending upon the court for the protection of his rights, or the witness while \n26  attending to testify.” Id. at 130. The Court later emphasized the “necessity of [the \n27  rule’s]  inflexibility”  in  order  to  serve  its  purpose  of  protecting  litigants  and \n28 \n     11                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.111     Page 13\nof 37\n \n \n1  witnesses in appearing in court. Page Co., 261 U.S. at 448; see also Long v. Ansell, \n2  293  U.S.  76,  83  (1934)  (Brandeis,  J.)  (describing  “the  common-law  rule  that \n3  witnesses, suitors, and their attorneys, while in attendance in connection with the \n4  conduct of one suit, are immune from service in another”); Lamb, 285 U.S. at 225. \n5  46.  Each applicant was not a flight risk as they lawfully appeared for their  \n6  hearings in pursuing their statutory rights.  In fact, Respondent-Defendants rely on \n7  Plaintiffs’ lack of flight risk, lying in wait to arrest and punish them when they do \n8  appear for their hearings.  By insisting Plaintiffs be re-arrested for their removal or \n9  seeking the asylum process, these agencies threaten the integrity of the proceedings \n10  and ignore the reasonable alternative, namely that their interests in initiating the \n11  removal  process  for  these  Plaintiffs  –  individuals  who  have  been  found  to  be \n12  neither flight risks or dangers to the community and who indeed appear when the \n13  government asks them to – can be accomplished without having to arrest them. \n14  Petitioners-Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  the  profound  disregard  of  common  law, \n15  statutory protections, international treatises, and basic rule of law in San Diego \n16  47.  DHS’s reinstated the previously enjoined practice of civilly arresting  \n17  people in the federal building and courthouses of the Southern District of \n18  California who are present for official court business unduly infringes upon \n19  Petitioners-Plaintiffs’  shared  common-law  right  to  be  free  from  civil \n20  courthouse arrest: \n21  DHS officers are routinely present in the U.S. courthouses in the Southern \nDistrict of California to effectuate civil immigration arrests of Plaintiffs \n22 \nwhen they appear in court for their asylum hearings \n23 \n48.  Immigration agents are believed to have arrested scores of people and  \n24 \nplan to do so for even more in perhaps the hundreds or thousands inside  \n25 \nthe federal building and courthouses of the Southern District of California. \n26 \n49.  Respondents-Defendants agents attend these hearings so they can  \n27 \neffectuate a civil courthouse arrest. That means ICE officers are present and poised \n28 \n     12                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.112     Page 14\nof 37\n \n \n1  to  conduct  administrative  arrests  at  every  immigration  hearing  in  the  Southern \n2  District of California where the government requests dismissals.  \n3  50.  When immigration officers attend the Plaintiffs’ hearings, they patrol the  \n4  hallways and hover next to the exit of the courtroom at the time of the proceeding.  \n5  51.  The officers are equipped with handcuffs and plan to effectuate a civil  \n6  arrest to place the defendant in immigration custody at the conclusion.  \n7  DHS officers conduct courthouse arrests without official warrants in or about \nthe U.S. Courthouses in the Southern District of California  \n8 \n52.   On information and belief, Plaintiffs believe that DHS intends to effectuate  \n9 \nwarrantless  immigration  arrests  of  plaintiffs  coming  to  court,  while  present  at \n10 \ncourt, or leaving court in connection with their pending immigration cases.  \n11 \n53.  If at all, Respondents have deployed administrative signed by staff, \n12 \nnot court-ordered judicial warrants by a magistrate or federal judge.  \n13 \n54.   Plaintiffs have been out of custody for months, are in compliance with the  \n14 \nconditions including attending all court hearings, and they do not present a risk of \n15 \nflight before DHS could obtain a warrant.  \n16 \nDHS’s civil courthouse arrest policies harm Plaintiffs by forcing them to \n17 \nappear in court believing that they could be subjected to an unlawful civil \n18 \narrest in the courthouse at any time. \n19 \n55.  Plaintiffs are appearing for their defensive asylum hearings. At trial, their  \n20 \ncredibility would surely be challenged on cross examination. But the Plaintiffs are \n21 \nall alleged to be undocumented aliens in the United States and their character \n22 \nwitnesses may be similarly undocumented.  \n23  56.  Plaintiffs’ decision on whether to testify at trial and call character  \n24  witnesses, or other witnesses, in support of their asylum case is chilled by the \n25  looming presence of immigration officers in court, targets certain groups, and used \n26  to harass or retaliate. Plaintiffs fear that full exercise of their rights to present a \n27  defense could lead to the arrest of undocumented witnesses or members of the \n28 \n     13                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.113     Page 15\nof 37\n \n \n1  public who come to court to observe the proceedings. \n2  B. Asylum, Withholding of Removal, Convention Against Torture \n3  57.  Plaintiffs-Petitioners sought fairness, due process protection, and the rule  \n4  of law in the United States:   \n5  58.  A.M. has long filed an asylum application and requested a credible fear  \n6  interview. He fears for detention and harm from Morocco and now faces arbitrary \n7  detention in the United States.  He seeks protections against being placed on a \nplane to a country where he has no ties, El Salvador, Sudan, or back to the country \n8 \nwhere he fled for his life from persecution, torture, and death threats.   \n9 \n59.  A.M. and others are being subjected to expedited removal despite  \n10 \nRespondents having knowledge of their claims for asylum and credible fear of \n11 \npersecution  the  Convention  against  Torture.  The  agency’s  refusal  to  provide  a \n12 \nmeaningful credible fear determination, arrest, resetting the clock, and detaining \n13 \nthe asylum seeker violates procedural due process and statutory rights under 8 \n14 \nU.S.C. § 1158 and § 1231(b)(3).  The restarting of proceedings is highly prejudicial \n15 \nand serves no legitimated government basis other than to harass, intimidate, delay, \n16 \nand increase taxpayers’ money especially as A.M. was scheduled for his asylum \n17 \nindividual merits hearing on the day he was arrested.   \n18 \n60.   Plaintiffs-Petitioners assert their rights to be free from civil arrest in this  \n19 \nComplaint. To be clear, Plaintiffs do not argue that the Defendants-Respondents \n20 \ncould not effectuate criminal arrests in the courthouse. Notably, DHS arrests that \n21 \nmerely place a person in immigration proceedings are civil arrests. See I.N.S. \n22 \nv. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1039 (1974) (holding that deportation \n23 \nproceedings are “purely” civil); Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 407 (2012) \n24 \n(holding that “it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present” in the \n25 \nUnited States and that deportation proceedings are civil).  \n26 \n61.  DHS officers attend asylum and immigration hearings relating to whether  \n27 \n28 \n     14                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.114     Page 16\nof 37\n \n \n1  they have experienced persecution, likely to be persecuted, eligible for asylum, \n2  withholding of removal or and ready to civilly arrest Petitioners-Plaintiffs once the \n3  hearings are pre-determined to be dismissed.  The anticipated arrests occur \n4  regardless of the veracity or strength of the claim - whether it be through a \n5  Government or Court’s granting the motion to dismiss– the officers are waiting to \n6  effectuate a warrantless civil arrest at or about the courtroom.  \n7  62.  Petitioner is informed and believes this opaque and obfuscatory policy,  \nprocedure, and/or practice is denying credible claims to statutory protections, and \n8 \nsubjecting eligible applicants with colorable claims to persecution, torture, or death \n9 \nagainst United States and international law.  \n10 \nC. Expedited Removal  \n11 \n63.  This is time-sensitive because the current U.S. government has been \n12 \nalleged to have sent asylum seekers, lawful permanent residents, and even U.S. \n13 \ncitizens  overseas  without  due  process,  and  have  not  been  able  to  retrieve  or \n14 \naccount for their whereabouts.  \n15 \n64.  Expedited removal has applied to those who were in the country less than \n16 \nfourteen (14) days and within 100 miles of the border. 8 C.F.R. 2385.3(b). \n17 \n65.  Respondents are using dismissing a section 240 case to trigger removal in  \n18 \nan overt evasion of procedural due process and statutory protections.  \n19 \n66.  Respondents refer to Section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality  \n20 \nAct (INA), as mandating that noncitizens subject to expedited removal be detained \n21 \nthroughout the process. \n22 \n67.  Courts have provided protections against Expedited Removal.   \n23 \n68.  Respondents-Defendants’ actions are retaliatory for those engaging in  \n24 \nprotected activity like filing an asylum claim or appearing at their mandated court \n25 \ncases. The government should not be forcing expedited removal as Petitioners-\n26 \nPlaintiffs have a right and sought a motion to appeal at the Bureau of Immigration \n27 \nof Appeals.  BIA could not find Petitioners to seek an emergency stay.   \n28 \n     15                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.115     Page 17\nof 37\n \n \n1  69.  The government has not guaranteed the due process rights of noncitizens.   \n2  A Proclamation signed on March 14 and published on March 15, the President \n3  invoked a war power, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (“AEA”), to summarily \n4  remove noncitizens from the U.S. and bypass the immigration laws Congress has \n5  enacted.  See  Invocation  of  the  Alien  Enemies  Act  (Mar.  15,  2025)  1 \n6  (“Proclamation”). The Proclamation accused Venezuelan noncitizens of being part \n7  of Tren de Aragua (“TdA”), a criminal gang. On the evening of March 15, 2025, \nthe D.C. District Court issued an order temporarily pausing removals pursuant \n8 \nProclamation of a provisionally certified nationwide class. J.G.G. v. Trump, No. \n9 \n25-5067,  2025  WL  914682,  at  *2  (D.C.  Cir.  Mar.  26,  2025).  That  order  was \n10 \nappealed by the government, but the court of appeals denied a stay. Id.  \n11 \n70.  In April 2025, the Supreme Court ruled that immigrants even under the  \n12 \nAlien  Enemies  Act  are  entitled  to  advance  notice  of  their  removal  and  a \n13 \nmeaningful opportunity to challenge their deportation through legal avenues. On \n14 \nApril 7, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court granted the government’s application \n15 \nto stay on the basis Petitioners would proceed through habeas, emphasizing those \n16 \nare “entitle[d] to due process” and notice “within a reasonable time and in \n17 \nsuch manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief” before removal. \n18 \nTrump v. J.G.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL 102409 (U.S. Apr. 7, 2025). \n19 \n71.  The government has not indicated the type of notice they intend to  \n20 \nprovide or how much time they will give individuals before seeking to remove \n21 \nthem. However, in a hearing in other jurisdictions in the Southern District of Texas \n22 \non Friday, April 11, the government said they had not ruled out the possibility that \n23 \nindividuals will receive no more than 24 hours’ notice; the government did not say \n24 \nwhether  it  was  considering  providing  even  less  than  24  hours.  In  light  of  the \n25 \nSupreme Court’s ruling that challenges to the Proclamation must be brought in \n26 \nhabeas, Petitioners file this action in his district of confinement and arrest.   \n27 \n72.  At or about end of May of 2025, Respondents started to show up at the \n28 \n     16                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.116     Page 18\nof 37\n \n \n1  immigration courts at valid asylum hearings and arrest the applicants at their court \n2  hearings in San Diego, at or about 880 Front Street, Edward J. Schwartz Federal \n3  Building and U.S. Courthouse, and stating that they will remove those applicants \n4  who are apprehended and withdrew the notice and opportunity to be heard.   \n5  73.  On June 4, 2025, with uncertainty and lack of clarity, A.M. petitioned this \n6  court for a writ of habeas corpus, a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, \n7  and emergency temporary restraining order (which this court granted), for fear of \nthose  in  immigration  custody  in  danger  of  imminent  removal  from  the  United \n8 \nStates (less than 24-hour notice) – and this court could potentially permanently \n9 \nlose  jurisdiction.  Petitioner  fears  of  the  imminent  danger  of  being  transferred \n10 \noutside of the Southern District of California en route to removal without a notice \n11 \nto appear, indefinite detention, and the lack of the opportunity to be heard and thus \n12 \nrequest an injunction on any transfer out of the Southern District of California, as \n13 \nwell as a 30-day notice of any intent to remove and due process protections. \n14 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15 \n74.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 et seq.  \n16 \n(habeas  corpus),  as  protected  under  Art.  I,  §  9,  cl.  2  of  the  U.S.  Constitution \n17 \n(Suspension Clause), 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (United States as defendant), 28 U.S.C. § \n18 \n1361 (mandamus), and 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (All Writs Act). \n19 \n75.  This Court has original jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Federal  \n20 \njurisdiction  exists  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1331  (federal  question).  This  court  has \n21 \nsupplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims arising under state law pursuant to \n22 \n28 U.S.C.§ 1367 (a) because those claims are so related to the federal claims that \n23 \nthey form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United \n24 \nStates Constitution.  Plaintiffs bring this action under the laws of the United States \n25 \nand the U.S. Constitution. \n26 \n76.  This case arises under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Fourteenth  \n27 \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, federal asylum statutes, the \n28 \n     17                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.117     Page 19\nof 37\n \n \n1  Administrative Procedure Act.  the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 \n2  U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. and its regs.; the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), see \n3  Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub.

Venue is proper in the Southern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \n9 \n§1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the  events, acts, or omissions giving rise \n10 \nto the claims occurred in the County of San Diego including at the time of filing \n11 \nPetitioner  is  detained  in  the  Respondents’  custody,  in  the  Southern  District  of \n12 \nCalifornia; Respondents JASON AGUILAR, Chief Counsel for Immigration and \n13 \nCustoms Enforcement San Diego, SIDNEY AKI, Director of Field Operations, San \n14 \nDiego  Field  Office  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  GREGORY  J. \n15 \nARCHAMBEAULT,  are  believed  to  reside  in  this  district;  Respondents  are \n16 \nagencies or officers of the United States in their official capacity.    \n17 \nPARTIES \n18 \nA. Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”)  \n19 \n79.  Petitioner is a 35-year-old Western Sahrawi man who has been a human  \n20 \nrights Defender at an internationally well-respected non-governmental organization \n21 \nthat has presented to the United Nations and European Commission of Human \n22 \nRights who is detained at the Otay Mesa Facility in San Diego and who, having \n23 \nreported to his hearing, is at imminent risk of removal and current practices that the \n24 \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has been deploying in San Diego.  \n25 \n80.  A.M. is seeking asylum on the basis of his political views, membership in a  \n26 \nsocial group, race-ethnicity, fear of harm, persecution, and mistreatment from his \n27 \ngovernment due to his immutable characteristics and human rights leadership.   \n28 \n     18                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.118     Page 20\nof 37\n \n \n1  81.  A.M. is diabetic and has medical complications due to past persecution and  \n2  requires access to daily medications and consistent medical care.   \n3  82.  The U.S. government has publicly stated that those with asylum claims  \n4  would proceed with their credible fear and asylum rights as a matter of law.   \n5  83.  However, after lawfully presenting himself for his asylum hearing, he was  \n6  arrested at the downtown Courthouse on June 3, 2025.     \n7  84.  He fears being deported, being unable to speak with his attorney, being  \ndenied adequate medical care, and being sent back to a country where he will be \n8 \nimprisoned, tortured, and likely killed by the Moroccan police since they have \n9 \ndone previously to him.  He fears that the Moroccan authorities will target him \n10 \nbecause of his political opinion, because he and his family are known human rights \n11 \nactivists, and he was a gold medalist who refused to promote the government.       \n12 \n85.  The government did not provide adequate notice or an opportunity to be  \n13 \nheard on why he is being detained but rather planned to ship him overseas and out \n14 \nof this jurisdiction without due process rights.  \n15 \n86.  A.M. and other Plaintiff-Petitioner are those who were similarly arrested  \n16 \nat the downtown courthouse, 880 Front Street, deprived of their credible fear \n17 \ninterviews, and are at risk of being sent on an airplane out of the jurisdiction \n18 \nor country without an opportunity to access or speak with an attorney despite \n19 \ntheir credible fear claims.   \n20 \n87.  To the extent able, Petitioner brings this action under Federal Rules of  \n21 \nCivil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2)4 on behalf himself and as an emergency and/or \n22 \npreliminary injunctive relief claim to preserve the rights of all other persons \n23 \nsimilarly situated who have been arrested or detained for appearing at their \n24 \n25   \n4 In a separate motion for emergency- injunctive provisional class certification, \n26 \nPlaintiff-Petitioner briefs the issue insofar that the eligible class has been detained, \n27  may be unrepresented, have not been able to access attorneys that A.M. seek to \nprotect his and their rights under time-sensitive, unprecedented circumstances.   \n28 \n     19                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.119     Page 21\nof 37\n \n \n1  court hearings, deprived the right of speaking to an attorney and are being \n2  subjected to be sent overseas without notice or an opportunity to be heard on \n3  their credible fear claims in the Southern District Court of California.  \n4  There’s commonality, typicality, adequacy, and numerosity: \n5  a.  The provisionary class members for an emergency order are subject to a \n6  common practice: courthouse arrests, deprivation of asylum protections, \n7  summary  removal,  contrary  to  the  INA,  statutory  protections, \nconstitutional and common law.   \n8 \nb.  Commonality:  Rule  23(a)(1)  The  suit  also  raises  questions  of  law  and \n9 \npractice common to members of the proposed class, including whether the \n10 \nDirective and its implementation of summary removal violate the APA, the \n11 \nINA, Fifth Amendment, and the statutory protections for asylum seekers.  \n12 \nThe  proposed  class  includes  numerous  future  noncitizens  who  will  be \n13 \nsubject to Respondents’ Directive and related policies or practices.  This is \n14 \nfiled to prevent the irreparable harm in which the detained will incur if \n15 \nthey are sent overseas without a notice and opportunity to be heard or \n16 \nprotections for their credible fear of being harmed, tortured, or killed.  \n17 \nc.  Numerosity Rule 23(a)(2)   \n18 \nThere is numerosity because there has been scores believed to be arrested, \n19 \nincluding dozen a day including at least throughout the weeks of May 20, \n20 \nMay 27, May 28, June 3, June 5, and the on-going future members impacted.  \n21 \nd.  Typicality (Rule 23(a)(3) \n22 \nTypicality applies here because all have suffered or will suffer the same \n23 \nconstitutional  and  statutory  violations  or  claims  as  a  result  of  the \n24 \ngovernment’s challenged practice, and because they seek singular injunctive \n25 \nand corresponding declaratory relief that remedy those injuries.   \n26 \ne.  Adequacy (Rule 23(a)(4)) \n27 \nThe proposed class satisfies the requirements as the representative \n28 \n     20                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.120     Page 22\nof 37\n \n \n1  Petitioners seek the same relief as the other members of the class – \n2  including, an order declaring the Directive unlawful and an injunction \n3  preventing the unlawful policy, practice, or procedure.  Plaintiffs and their \n4  counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n5  f.  The proposed class also satisfies Rule 23(b)(2).  Respondents have acted \n6  (or will act) on grounds generally applicable to the class by subjecting them \n7  to summary removal under the Proclamation rather than affording them the \nprotection of immigration laws.  Injunctive and declaratory relief is therefore \n8 \nappropriate with respect to the whole.   \n9 \n88.  Petitioners-Plaintiffs share the similar commonality in having complied  \n10 \nwith and the U.S. government’s rules until the rules were arbitrarily changed.  \n11 \n89.  Under current DHS practice, numerous other asylum-seekers are being  \n12 \narrested and detained at their asylum, hearings. \n13 \n90.  Plaintiffs have seen immigration officers waiting in court presumably to  \n14 \narrest him/her at prior court appearances if the case had concluded and believes \n15 \nthat  he/she  and/or  their  witnesses  face  likely  civil  immigration  arrest  in  court \n16 \nfollowing conclusion of the hearing.   \n17 \n91.  There is overwhelming medical evidence that the incarceration of a person  \n18 \nwill have a negative impact on their well-being especially where there are other \n19 \ntraumatic factors at work, and that damage can be permanent.    \n20 \n92.  For these reasons set forth herein, Plaintiff ask this court to declare \n21 \nthat  DHS’s  policies  authorizing  civil  arrests  in  the  federal  building  and \n22 \ncourthouses  of  the  Southern  District  Court  of  California  are  unlawful,  to \n23 \ndeclare  that  DHS’s  practice  of  filing  to  obtain  a  warrant  for  courthouse \n24 \narrests is illegal, and to enjoin DHS from sending noncitizens to countries \n25 \nwithout notice and a credible fear interview.   \n26 \nB.

All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set herein.  \n106. The government has not provided an explanation for its actions or the  \n8 \nappliable law but has incarcerated countless individuals alleged to be noncitizens at \n9 \ntheir court hearings.. Notably, even the AEA does not authorize the removal of \n10 \nnoncitizens  from  the  United  States  absent  a  “declared  war”  or  a  “perpetrated, \n11 \nattempted, or threatened” “invasion or predatory incursion” into the United States \n12 \nby a “foreign nation or government.” See 50 U.S.C. § 21.. \n13 \n107. However, Petitioners-Plaintiffs are being subject to immediate removal  \n14 \nwithout any guarantees the Respondents-Defendants will afford the privilege of \n15 \nvoluntary departure, notice or an opportunity to respond, or asylum protections.   \n16 \n108. The application of the unstated process is therefore ultra vires.  \n17 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n18 \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. \n19 \n(All Respondents) \n20 \n109. All of the foregoing allegations are repeated as if fully set forth herein. \n21 \n110. The INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., sets out the sole mechanisms established  \n22 \nBy Congress for the removal of noncitizens. \n23 \n111. The INA provides that a removal proceeding before an immigration judge  \n24 \nunder  8  U.S.C.  §  1229a  is  “the  sole  and  exclusive  procedure”  by  which  the \n25 \ngovernment may determine whether to remove an individual, “[u]nless otherwise \n26 \nspecified” in the INA. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3). \n27 \n112. The current policy, conduct creates an alternative removal mechanism  \n28 \n     24                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.124     Page 26\nof 37\n \n \n1  outside of the immigration laws set forth by Congress in Title 8. \n2  113. The INA’s “exclusive procedure” and statutory protections apply to any  \n3  removal of a noncitizen from the United States. Because the current process or \n4  conduct provides for the removal of Petitioners without the procedures specified in \n5  the INA, it violates 8 U.S.C. § 1229a and the INA. \n6  114. As a result, the application of the Directive to Petitioners-Plaintiffs, which  \n7  will result in their removal from the United States, is contrary to law. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8 \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum \n9 \n(All Respondents) \n10 \n115. All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set herein.  \n11 \n116. The INA provides, “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United  \n12 \nStates or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of \n13 \narrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been \n14 \ninterdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s \n15 \nstatus, shall apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, \n16 \nsection 1225(b) of this title.” 8 U.S.C §1158(a)(1). \n17 \n117.  Petitioners-Respondents arrest after a hearing violates federal asylum, law  \n18 \nbecause it impedes their ability to pursue their asylum claims.  \n19 \n118. Respondents’ application of Expedited Removal to Petitioners prevents  \n20 \nthem from applying for asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) and is contrary to law. \n21 \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal \n23 \n(All Respondents) \n24 \n119. Plaintiffs reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate the  \n25 \nsame herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n26 \n120. The “withholding of removal” statute, INA § 241(b)(3), codified at 8  \n27 \n28 \n     25                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.125     Page 27\nof 37\n \n \n1  U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), bars the removal of noncitizens to a country where it is more \n2  likely than not that they would face persecution. \n3  121. Respondents’ Process violates the withholding of removal statute  \n4  because it does not provide adequate safeguards to ensure that Petitioners are not \n5  returned to a country where it is more likely than not they would face persecution. \n6  Accordingly, Respondents’ actions against Petitioners are contrary to law. \n7  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 \n8 \n(“FARRA”) codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note \n9 \nConvention Against Torture \n10 \n(All Respondents) \n11 \n122.  Plaintiffs realleges all prior paragraphs as incorporated fully herein.  \n12 \n123. The United States is bound by the United Nations Convention Against  \n13 \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \n14 \n(“CAT”), which prohibits returning any individual to a country where it is more \n15 \nlikely than not that they would be subjected to torture. \n16 \n124. Article 3 of the CAT, as implemented by the Foreign Affairs Reform and  \n17 \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), and its regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 208.16–18, \n18 \nrequire that no person be removed to a country where they are likely to face torture \n19 \nat the hands of the government or with its acquiescence. \n20 \n125. Petitioner has expressed a credible and well-supported fear of torture upon  \n21 \nreturn to [Country], supported by evidence including country conditions, \n22 \nmedical/psychological documentation, affidavits, and testimony. \n23 \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n24 \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22 \n25 \n(All Respondents) \n26 \n126. All of the allegations are repeated and realleged as if set forth herein. \n27 \n127. The Directive requires that noncitizens whose removal is authorized \n28 \n     26                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.126     Page 28\nof 37\n \n \n1  unless “chargeable with actual hostility, or other crime against the public safety,” \n2  be allowed the full time stipulated by treaty to depart or a reasonable time in which \n3  to settle their affairs before departing. See 50 U.S.C. § 22. The Directive on its face \n4  denies Petitioners any time under Section 22 to settle their affairs, because it \n5  declares everyone subject to Expedite Removal, including asylum seekers who \n6  have already filed their I-589 and established they have fear of returning to their \n7  country due to torture, persecution, or death. \n128. The current practice contravenes 50 U.S.C. § 22 and is ultra vires. \n8 \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n9 \nViolation of Due Process Under the First Amendment \n10 \n(Right to Provide Legal Advice, Right to Counsel, Petition the Government) \n11 \n(All Respondents) \n12 \n129.   Plaintiffs reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n13 \nthe same herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n14 \n130. The First Amendment to the United States guarantees fundamental  \n15 \nfreedoms, including freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, the right to petition \n16 \nthe government, free exercise.  \n17 \n131. Upon information and belief, Defendants-Respondents’ policies, practices,  \n18 \nand conduct are denying access to counsel and obstructs certain freedoms.  \n19 \n132. Plaintiffs-Petitioners have certain rights to access their counsel.  \n20 \n133. Plaintiffs-Petitioners are informed and believe Defendants-Respondents’  \n21 \npolicies, practices, and conduct are denying noncitizens their rights to \n22 \ncommunicate with counsel, in violation of the First Amendment.  \n23 \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n24 \nViolation of Due Process Under the Fourth, Fifth, Fourteenth Amendment \n25 \n(All Respondents) \n26 \n134.   Plaintiffs reallege all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n27 \nthe same herein by this reference as if fully set below. \n28 \n     27                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.127     Page 29\nof 37\n \n \n1  135. The Fourth Amendment guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures. \n2  136. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides for fair and  \n3  adequate hearing and an opportunity to be heard. \n4  137. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons”  \n5  on United States soil and thus applies to A.M. and Petitioners-Plaintiffs. \n6  138. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection. \n7  139. A.M. have a life and liberty interest under the Due Process Clause. \n140. A.M. was denied a fair opportunity to present their case, Respondents’  \n8 \nactions prevented a lawful hearing, and intimidated from accessing the courts.   \n9 \n141. The arrest at an asylum hearing violates procedural due process because it  \n10 \nfurthers no legitimate purpose other than chill or prevent access to the court system \n11 \nwith those attempting to comply, not to mention a compelling government interest.  \n12 \n142. The mechanics of how ICE courthouse arrests occur is unnecessary,  \n13 \nconfusing, and not related to advancing the governments interest.   \n14 \n143. The U.S. Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention without prompt notices  \n15 \nof charges or meaningful opportunity to be heard. \n16 \nNINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n17 \nViolation of Habeas Corpus \n18 \n(All Respondents) \n19 \n144. Plaintiffs realleges all prior paragraphs of this complaint and incorporate  \n20 \nthe same herein by this reference.  \n21 \n145. The protection of habeas corpus is enshrined in Article I, section 9 of the  \n22 \nUnited States Constitution.  \n23 \n146. Detainees have the right to file for habeas corpus to challenge the legality \n24 \nof their detention or raise claims related to their detention or the basis of removal. \n25 \n147. The detention of Petitioners under Expedited Removal has violated and \n26 \ncontinues to violate their right to habeas corpus. See 28 U.S.C. § 2241; U.S. Const. \n27 \nart. I, § 9, cl. 2 (Suspension Clause). \n28 \n     28                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.128     Page 30\nof 37\n \n \n1  TENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  (Administrative Procedure Act) \n3  (All Respondents) \n4  148. All of the allegations are repeated and re-alleged as though set herein.  \n5  149. The APA prohibits agency action that is arbitrary and capricious. \n6  150. The detention of asylum seekers at their immigration hearings without a  \n7  legitimate justification is arbitrary and capricious and accordingly violates the \nAPA. 5 U.S.C. §706.  \n8 \n151. There is no legitimate purpose in detaining Petitioners at the asylum  \n9 \nhearing as they were about to adjudicate their claims and now costs the U.S. \n10 \nincreased costs to detain or ship off to an unknown location overseas.. \n11 \n152. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) instructs courts to “hold  \n12 \nunlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n13 \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n14 \nAccordingly, defendants may only exercise authority conferred by statute. City of \n15 \nArlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297-98 (2013). \n16 \nCOUNT I \n17  DHS’s Courthouse Arrest Policy is Arbitrary, Capricious, an Abuse of \nDiscretion, or Otherwise Not in Accordance with Law in Violation of the \n18 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n19  153. DHS’s enforcement policy any “alien” may be arrested at a known location \n20  is a final agency action subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act.  \n21  154. DHS’s policies regarding courthouse arrest are arbitrary and capricious  \n22  because Respondents-Defendants do not sufficiently explain to whom the policies \n23  apply, fail fully to consider the foreseeable harms and/or costs of the policies, do \n24  not adequately explain its prioritizing of civil arrests in or near courthouses over \n25  the severe harms triggered by those arrests, and do not adequately justify the \n26  change from Respondents-Defendants’ prior policies. \n27  155. DHS’s application of their policies are further arbitrary and capricious as  \n28 \n     29                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.129     Page 31\nof 37\n \n \n1  applied to the Plaintiffs because all of the Plaintiffs have been ruled not to be a risk \n2  of flight when the magistrate set bond in their criminal prosecutions. Plaintiffs are \n3  all in compliance with the conditions of their pretrial release, which is further \n4  evidence that their arrest at court does not further a legitimate need by ICE to arrest \n5  them because their removal can be accomplished without detaining them anew. \n6  Moreover, Defendants are not complying with their own policies.  \n7  156. Plaintiffs-Petitioners have been lawfully playing by the rules.  At the least  \nthey should be provided voluntary departure.  \n8 \n157.    DHS’s courthouse arrest policies are arbitrary and capricious for a  \n9 \nmultitude of reasons including their failure to explain this historic deviation in \n10 \npolicy, the application of the policies is inconsistent, and the policies fail to \n11 \nadvance legitimate immigration enforcement interests. \n12 \n158. Defendants’ violation causes ongoing and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs. \n13 \n14  COUNT II \nDHS’s Courthouse Arrest Policies Exceed Statutory Authority in Violation of \n15  the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) \n16  (All Respondents) \n17  159. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the  \n18  preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n19  160. The Administrative Procedure Act instructs courts to “hold unlawful and  \n20  set aside agency action” that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \n21  limitations....” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \n22  161. There exists a longstanding common-law privilege against civil arrest of  \n23  witnesses, parties, and others attending court on official business recognized by \n24  both federal and state courts.  \n25  162. The validity of DHS authorizing civil arrest of parties and witnesses  \nattending court depends on whether the grant of power to conduct civil arrests \n26 \nsomehow abrogated the well-settled common law privilege that civil arrests cannot \n27 \n28 \n     30                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.130     Page 32\nof 37\n \n \n1  be used to arrest parties, witnesses and those attending court on official business. \n2  163. Given the “longstanding [] principle that statutes which invade the common  \n3  law are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established \n4  and familiar principles,” a statute must “speak directly to the question addressed by \n5  the common law” to “abrogate a common-law principle.” Texas, 507 U.S. at 534 \n6  (1993) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The statute authorizing \n7  DHS to conduct civil immigration arrests does not “speak directly to the question \n8  addressed by the common law”—i.e., it does not speak to whether DHS can use a \n9  party or witness’s appearance in court as a trap for purposes of a civil arrest. \n10  Instead, the statute simply authorizes arrest and detention, while saying nothing \n11  about how, when, or where such arrests may take place. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), \n12  1357(a).  Thus,  the  power  Congress  granted  to  DHS  to  conduct  civil  arrests \n13  inherently contains within it the common-law limitation that parties, witnesses, and \n14  others attending court on official business are privileged from civil arrest. \n15  164. To the extent there is any ambiguity concerning whether the INA  \n16  incorporates or abrogates the common-law privilege, the constitutional concerns \n17  raised  by  DHS’s  courthouse  arrest  policies,  resolve  that  ambiguity  in  favor  of \n18  interpreting the statute to limit DHS’s authority. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. \n19  371,  380-82  (2005)  (when  there  are  “competing  plausible  interpretations  of  a \n20  statutory text,” courts should apply “the reasonable presumption that Congress did \n21  not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts”). \n22  165.   Abrogating the common-law privilege violates the Constitutional right of \n23  access to the courts, which prohibits “systemic official action [that] frustrates a \n24  plaintiff or plaintiff class in preparing and filing suits.” Christopher v. Harbury, \n25  536  U.S.  403,  413,  415  &  n.12  (2002).  Such  “frustrat[ion]”  includes  not  only \n26  policies that ban access outright, but also obstruct access. E.g., id. at 413. Forcing \n27  noncitizens to risk civil arrest at the courts creates such impermissible frustration.  \n28 \n     31                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.131     Page 33\nof 37\n \n \n1  166.  DHS’s most recent policies authorize civil courthouse arrests that  \n2  Congress never authorized DHS to conduct and contravene their own policies, \n3  regulations, and procedures that asylum seekers relied upon. The policies are \n4  thus “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” and “arbitrary, \n5  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.” \n6  conduct should be unlawful and set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n7  167.  The courthouse arrests impact noncitizen communities broadly, instilling  \n8  fear and distrust of the government, law enforcement, and the judiciary.  \n9  168. Congress’ general grant of power to DHS to conduct civil arrests did not  \n10  abrogate  the  well-settled  common  law  privilege  that  prohibits  civil  arrests  of \n11  parties, witnesses and others attending court on official business.  \n12  169. If asylees show up to court, they might get arrested, detained indefinitely,  \n13  or sent back to the country where they fled persecution, but if they do not appear, a \n14  judge may rule adversely against them and permanently lose their rights. \n15  170.   DHS’s courthouse arrest policies authorizing civil arrests of people in,  \n16  or  traveling  to  or  from,  courthouses,  and  DHS’s  practice  of  carrying  out  civil \n17  arrests against individuals attending federal immigration courthouses within the \n18  Southern District of California, thus exceed DHS’s statutory authority.  \n19  171.  The policies are “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or  \n20  limitations” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(C).  \n21  172.   Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n22  COUNT III \nDHS’s Courthouse Arrest Policies Violate the Right of Access to the Courts \n23 \n173. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the  \n24 \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n25 \n174. Defendants’ actions deprive Plaintiffs of meaningful access to the federal  \n26 \ncourthouses of the Southern District of California in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights \n27 \nunder the United States Constitution. \n28 \n     32                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.132     Page 34\nof 37\n \n \n1  175. Policies that ban access outright and policies that obstruct the right of  \n2  access to courts in more subtle ways are prohibited.  \n3  176. Forcing noncitizens who have been fully compliant to choose between  \n4  exercising their right to present asylum claims or risk being subjected to a civil \n5  arrest at a federal courthouse in the Southern District of California impermissibly \n6  frustrates  the  right  of  access  to  courts,  as  protected  by  the  First,  Fifth,  Sixth, \n7  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  \n8  177. DHS’s courthouse arrest policies, practices, and conduct were adopted by  \n9  Defendants without any consideration of the foreseeable harms of their policy, \n10  without  adequate  explanation  of  their  prioritizing  civil  arrests  in  or  around \n11  courthouses over those harms, and without adequate justification of the change \n12  from Defendants’ prior policies on courthouse arrests.  \n13  178. The courthouse arrest policies are therefore unconstitutional because they  \n14  infringe on Plaintiffs’ right to access the courts free from fear of civil arrest.  \n15  179. These policies, practices, and procedures cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nCOUNT IV \n16 \nDHS’s Warrantless Courthouse Arrests Violate 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) because \nPlaintiffs Are Not a Flight Risk and the Arrests therefore Violate the \n17 \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \n18 \n180. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth fully herein. \n19 \n181. Plaintiffs allege that DHS has not obtained a warrant for their arrest in  \n20 \ncompliance  with  8  U.S.C.  §  1357(a)(2).  Section  1357(a)(2)  authorizes  DHS  to \n21 \nmake warrantless arrests only if (1) there is “reason to believe” the alien is present \n22 \nin the United States in violation of immigration law; and (2) the alien “is likely to \n23 \nescape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest. . . .”  \n24 \n182. Courts have continually recognized and required strict adherence to § 1357.  \n25 \nSee  Arizona  v.  United  States,  567  U.S.  387,  408,  410  (2012)  (holding  that  an \n26 \nArizona  statute  was  preempted  because  it  purported  to  give  Arizona  law \n27 \nenforcement  greater  warrantless  arrest  authority  “than  Congress  has  given  to \n28 \n     33                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.133     Page 35\nof 37\n \n \n1  trained federal immigration officers,” emphasizing that warrantless arrest authority \n2  is limited to situations where there is a likelihood of escape before a warrant can be \n3  obtained); Mountain High Knitting, Inc. v. Reno, 51 F.3d 216, 218 (9th Cir. 1995) \n4  (holding that this statute requires an individualized determination of flight risk); \n5  United  States  v.  Meza-Campos,  500  F.2d  33  (9th  Cir.  1975)  (applying  an \n6  individualized likelihood-of-escape analysis).5 \n7  183. DHS cannot show that Plaintiffs pose a risk of escape before it can obtain a  \n8  warrant.  Plaintiffs  are  all  out  of  custody  on  bond  in  their  petty  offense \n9  prosecutions, and their release on bond required a magistrate judge to rule that they \n10  do not pose an unreasonable risk of flight. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ criminal cases \n11  have all been pending for many months, and DHS could have used this time to \n12  obtain a warrant. Even if DHS can establish a reason to believe that Plaintiffs are \n13  present in the United States in violation of immigration law, it cannot establish that \n14  Plaintiffs are “likely to escape” when it has failed to obtain a warrant during the \n15 \n \n16 \n5 See also, De La Paz v. Coy, 786 F.3d 367, 376 (5th Cir. 2015) (“[E]ven if an \n17  agent has reasonable belief, before making an arrest, there must also be a \nlikelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.”); \n18 \nMorales v. Chadbourne, 793 F.3d 208, 216 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting § 1357(a)(2)) \n19  (“Without a warrant, immigration officers are authorized to arrest an alien only if \nthey have “reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in \n20 \nviolation of any [immigration] law or regulation and is likely to escape before a \n21  warrant can be obtained for his arrest.”); United States v. Harrison, 168 F.3d 483, \n1999 WL 26921, at *4 (4th Cir. 1999) (unpublished) (explaining that “the critical \n22 \nquestion remains did the INS believe Harrison was likely to flee before a warrant \n23  could be obtained. In making such a determination, a court examines the objective \nfacts with the knowledge of the INS Agents”; rejecting the Government’s position \n24 \n“that in every case in which an alien is deportable an arrest can be made without a \n25  warrant”); Westover v. Reno, 202 F.3d 475, 479-80 (1st Cir. 2000) (commenting \nthat an immigration arrest was “in direct violation” of § 1357(a)(2) because \n26 \n“[w]hile INS agents may have had probable cause to arrest Westover by the time \n27  they took her into custody, there is no evidence that Westover was likely to escape \nbefore a warrant could be obtained for her arrest”). \n28 \n     34                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.134     Page 36\nof 37\n \n \n1  months while Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ cases have been pending.  \n2  184. Petitioners-Plaintiffs seek to enjoin DHS from arresting them without a  \n3  federal warrant while at court, and on their way to and from court appearances \n4  mandated by their petty offense prosecutions. Plaintiffs conclusively show that \n5  they are not “likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained,” § 1357(a)(2), \n6  because they are in compliance with the court-ordered conditions of bond.  \n7  185. Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ cases have been pending for months or nearly two  \n8  years and the length of time has afforded DHS sufficient time to obtain a warrant.  \n9  186. Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ compliance with court orders for the pendency of  \n10  their Immigration cases and appearance in court as ordered defeats any argument \n11  that they pose a risk of flight before a warrant can be obtained. The Court should \n12  therefore enjoin DHS from arresting Plaintiffs without a warrant while on their \n13  way to court, at court, or departing court in connection with their asylum rights.  \n14  COUNT V \nDHS’s Warrantless Federal Building Courthouse Arrests Violate Plaintiffs’ \n15 \nFourth Amendment Rights \n16 \n187. Petitioners-Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in  \n17 \neach of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n18 \n188. The Fourth Amendment guarantees Plaintiffs the right to be free from  \n19 \n“unreasonable searches and seizures. . .” Plaintiffs assert DHS intends to arrest \n20 \nthem when they appear in court without a warrant.  \n21 \n189. “[U]nlike illegal entry, mere unauthorized presence in the United  \n22 \nStates is not a crime.” Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1000 (9th Cir. 2012). \n23 \nDHS’s warrantless courthouse arrests are not in response to new criminal activity; \n24 \nrather, DHS’s administrative arrests are used to place people immediate removal.  \n25 \n190. DHS’s warrantless courthouse arrests are not authorized by law, and the  \n26 \narrests violate Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable \n27 \ngovernment seizure and arrest.   \n28 \n     35                               \nAMENDED PETITION FOR HABEAS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:25-cv-01412-JO-AHG     Document 18     Filed 06/07/25     PageID.135     Page 37\nof 37\n \n \n1  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n2  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs-Petitioners pray for judgment as follows: \n3  A.
