    "summary": "<p>On July 7, 1982, a mentally disabled ward of the state of North Carolina, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the State of North Carolina in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina.  The plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated his constitutional rights by denying him treatment of his mental disabilities (intellectual disabilities and schizophrenia) in a less restrictive, more community-based setting.  </p><p>On May 26, 1983, the parties agreed to a special treatment plan which provided appropriate community-based treatment for the plaintiff until March 1, 1984.  That agreement was incorporated into a judgment by the court, and the court deferred ruling on all the parties' motions for summary judgment, designating the case as inactive until February 1, 1984.  During the interim, the plaintiff was shifted to three additional placements.  The defendants eventually placed him in the Gaston County detoxification facility because they had no other place for him to live.</p><p>On September 18, 1984, the court (Judge James Bryan McMillan) granted summary judgment to the plaintiff on his constitutional claims.  The court held that the defendants, who had been appointed guardians of the plaintiff, were charged with the responsibility, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to ensure that legitimate restraints placed on the plaintiff were no more restrictive than necessary.  Thomas S. by Brooks v. Morrow, 601 F.Supp. 1055 (W.D.N.C. 1984).  The defendants appealed.    </p><p>On December 7, 1984, the district court permitted the intervention of four additional plaintiffs and certified them as a class.  However, the court stayed further litigation on behalf of the intervening plaintiffs and class members pending the outcome of the defendants' appeal.  On January 9, 1986, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Judge John Decker Butzner, Jr.) affirmed the district court's decision.  Thomas S. v. Morrow, 781 F.2d 367 (4th Cir. 1986).  The defendants appealed that decision, and on May 19, 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.  Kirk v. Thomas S., 476 U.S. 1124 (1986).</p><p>On November 21, 1988, following trial, the district court (Judge McMillan) held that the defendants had violated the due process rights of the members of the plaintiff class.  The court held that the plaintiffs had a constitutional right to live in a minimally adequate habilitation in a safe environment, free from undue bodily restraint.  Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 699 F.Supp. 1178 (W.D.N.C. 1988).  The defendants appealed.  On May 23, 1990, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Judge Butzner) affirmed the district court's decision.  Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1990).  The defendants appealed.  On October 29, 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.  Flaherty v. Thomas S., 498 U.S. 951 (1990).</p><p>Several years later, the defendants asked the court to narrow the plaintiff class to include only those \"treated clinically as mentally retarded.\"  The district court (Judge McMillan) declined to narrow the class in that manner, and the defendants appealed.  On July 15, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued a per curiam opinion affirming the district court's ruling.  Thomas S. v. Flaherty, No. 93-1018, 1993 WL 264697 (4th Cir. 1993).</p><p>The parties continued to litigate regarding attorneys' fees, and on July 27, 1998, the district court closed the case.</p><p></p>",

In Thomas \nS. v. Morrow, 781 F.2d 367 (4th Cir.1986) (Thomas II ), this court affirmed the district \ncourt's grant of summary judgment for the named plaintiff Thomas S. against the \nSecretary of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources. Thomas S. v. Morrow, \n601 F.Supp. 1055 (W.D.N.C.1984) (Thomas I ). In this, the second phase of the litigation, \nthe district court certified a class of patients similarly situated to Thomas S. After a \nbench trial, the court issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law and ordered \ninjunctive relief for the class members. Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F.Supp. 1178 \n(W.D.N.C.1988) (Thomas III ). The Secretary appeals the district court's judgment. We \naffirm. \n\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \n2 \nThe district court described the history of the proceedings and the facts in detail. \nThomas III, 699 F.Supp. at 1181-99. It is not necessary to reiterate the court's findings \nand conclusions other than to say they dealt with the deficient care of mentally retarded \npersons in North Carolina's psychiatric hospitals. We proceed to address the Secretary's \narguments on appeal. \n3 \n* The Secretary first contends that the district court did not follow the principles of \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), and Thomas \nII, 781 F.2d 367. Specifically, he asserts that the court did not defer to the judgment of \ntreating professionals. \n4 \nThe Supreme Court in Youngberg held that a mentally retarded individual in state \ncustody \"enjoys constitutionally protected interests in conditions of reasonable care and \nsafety, reasonably nonrestrictive confinement conditions, and such training as may be \nrequired by these interests.\" 457 U.S. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. To determine whether an \nindividual's rights have been violated, courts must show deference to the decisions of \nprofessionals: \n5 \n[T]he decision, if made by a professional, is presumptively valid; liability may be \nimposed only when the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from \naccepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person \nresponsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment. \n6 \n457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 (footnote omitted). \n7 \nThe purpose of this standard is to prevent a judge or jury from using \"unguided \ndiscretion\" to balance the individual's liberty interests against the state interest in \nrestraining liberty. 457 U.S. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. Deference to professionals ensures \nthat federal courts do not unnecessarily interfere with the internal operations of state \ninstitutions. 457 U.S. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. \n8 \nThe decisions of the treating professionals are not conclusive, however. Although the \nquestion of admissibility of expert testimony offered by the mentally retarded plaintiff \nwas not appealed to the Supreme Court in Youngberg, the Court noted that this expert \ntestimony may have been relevant to whether the treating professionals' decisions \nsubstantially departed from accepted standards. 457 U.S. at 323 n. 31, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 \nn. 31. \n9 \n\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \nHere, the district court avoided the danger that the Youngberg standard was designed \nto prevent. It did not weigh the decisions of the treating professionals against the \ntestimony of the class members' professionals to decide which of several acceptable \nstandards should apply. Rather, as Youngberg requires, it presumed that the decisions of \nthe treating professionals were valid. However, it found that many of the decisions of the \ntreating professionals had not been implemented. This was also the situation in Thomas \nII, 781 F.2d at 374-76. \n10 \nThe court also found areas in which the decisions of the treating professionals \nsubstantially departed from accepted standards. Specifically, the court found the \nSecretary's decisions \"to confine mentally retarded persons with no diagnosis of mental \nillness in state psychiatric hospitals,\" \"to place mentally retarded persons on general \npsychiatric wards,\" \"to seclude and mechanically restrain the plaintiffs without \nemploying behavioral treatment programs,\" \"to administer antipsychotic drugs at the \nlevels and under the conditions found to exist in the state psychiatric hospitals,\" and \"to \nignore the community placement recommendations of the state's treating professionals\" \nsubstantially departed from accepted professional standards. 699 F.Supp. at 1201-02. \nThe court identified the accepted professional standards regarding drug use, restraint, \nand habilitation based on the Secretary's written policies and the testimony of the \nplaintiffs' and defendant's experts. There is ample evidence supporting the court's \nfinding that the Secretary substantially departed from these identified standards. \n11 \nThe Secretary contends that the district court erred in rejecting the significance of the \naccreditation of the four state hospitals by the Joint Committee on Accreditation of \nHospitals (JCAH) and the certification of the R Unit at Broughton Hospital by the Health \nCare Financing Administration as an intermediate care facility for mentally retarded \npatients. \n12 \nThis argument does not withstand analysis. Relevant accreditation is prima facie \nevidence of constitutionally adequate conditions. See Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 106-\n07 (2d Cir.1984). The record, however, supports the court's conclusion that this \npresumption was rebutted by evidence of serious deficiencies found by the accreditation \nteam. During a survey by JCAH personnel while this action was pending, their report \ndisclosed the following deficiencies in Broughton Hospital, which is generally regarded \nto be superior to other state institutions: \n13 \n(1) Minimal participation of patients and their guardians in treatment planning. \n14 \n(2) Insufficient professional and support staff to supervise and implement the \ntreatment plan or provide adult educational services. \n15 \n(3) Inadequate or non-existent emotional, behavioral, activities, legal and vocational \nassessments. \n\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \n16 \n(4) Inadequate treatment plans and inadequate documentation of their \nimplementation. \n17 \n(5) Use of special treatment procedures that are not justified in light of the harm they \nare known to cause. \n18 \n(6) The use of seclusion and restraint where written justification is inadequate or non-\nexistent and where less intrusive methods were not considered. \n19 \n(7) Failure of the hospital administration to monitor the unwarranted use of seclusion \nand restraint. \n20 \n(8) Failure of staff to note clients' response to activity services. \n21 \n(9) Failure to monitor and evaluate the quality and appropriateness of activity \nservices. \n22 \n(10) Failure to provide adequate education services. \n23 \n(11) Violation of life safety standards. \n24 \n699 F.Supp. at 1197. Other conditions in Broughton noted by a team of federal \nofficials, while this suit was pending, dealt with deficiencies with respect to minimum \nstandards for Medicaid intermediate care of mentally retarded patients: \n25 \n(1) \"[I]nconsistent supervision in the delivery of individualized plans of care for \nresidents, specifically as to areas of health, hygiene, grooming and toilet training.\" \n26 \n(2) No evidence that the mental retardation professional \"had assured that all \nrecommendations were carried out.\" \n27 \n(3) Deficits in staff training concerning developmental needs and other issues. \n\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \n28 \n(4) Only custodial care in the living units. \n29 \n(5) Lack of privacy at shower time. \n30 \n(6) Lack of systematic training for residents to develop eating skills. \n31 \n(7) Failure to document drug reviews in the clients' record or make the reviews \navailable to professional staff. \n32 \n(8) On ten of ten records reviewed, no evidence that the physical therapist had \nconducted an initial screening. \n33 \n(9) That recreation equipment was not visible and in enough quantity to carry out the \nstated objectives of the activities program. \n34 \n699 F.Supp. at 1198. \nII \n35 \nThe Secretary argues that the court improperly found that the class members had a \nright to treatment in the least restrictive environment. He is concerned that the court \nimproperly requires community placement for class members. \n36 \nThe court did not apply a least restrictive analysis. Rather, the court identified the \nclass members' right to minimally adequate habilitation in a setting minimally adequate \nto reduce self-abuse and aggression. 699 F.Supp. 1205-06. The court ordered \nhabilitation in \"a training setting which approximates the more normal environment \nagainst which their increasing independence will be measured,\" \"the development of \nindividual plans for moving class members to more normal settings,\" and \"the provision \nof alternative habilitation settings where professional recommendations can be carried \nout.\" 699 F.Supp. at 1204. \n37 \nThe court's order follows Youngberg's teaching that the \"minimally adequate training \nrequired by the Constitution is such training as may be reasonable in light of \nrespondent's liberty interests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints.\" 457 \nU.S. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. We do not interpret the court's order to require \n\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \ncommunity placement of all class members. The court has set up a process in which the \nneeds of each class member will be evaluated by professionals on a case-by-case basis. \nThe court can do no more than to articulate general standards to guide these evaluations. \nThe professional evaluators may or may not find that the minimally adequate setting for \nhabilitation for an individual class member is placement in the community. Such a \nfinding would be consistent with dictum in Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 607, 99 S.Ct. \n2493, 2506, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979), which recognized the necessity of a continuing need \nto review commitment to a mental institution. Parham dealt with the commitment of \nchildren, but there appears to be no reason why its principles should not be applied to \npersons whose incompetency results from mental retardation instead of age. See Clark v. \nCohen, 794 F.2d 79, 86 (3d Cir.1986); Thomas II, 781 F.2d at 374-76. \nIII \n38 \nThe Secretary also contends that the court defined the class too broadly to include \nmentally retarded adults who were released from psychiatric hospitals after the date of \nclass certification, March 22, 1984. The Secretary takes the position that persons who are \nno longer in state custody have no substantive due process rights to minimally adequate \ntreatment and thus should not be included in the order. The Secretary principally relies \non Youngberg, Thomas II, and DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Servs., \n489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), for the proposition that the state \nhas no duty to provide services to persons not under state control. \n39 \nWe held in Thomas II that a mentally retarded patient retained his constitutional \nrights under Youngberg after transfer from a state psychiatric hospital to an \ninappropriate detoxification center. We reasoned that his status as a legally incompetent \nadult who is a ward of a state-appointed guardian had not changed and he had no choice \nabout his living arrangements. 781 F.2d at 374. Here, too, the order provides a remedy \nfor retarded patients who were in a public psychiatric institution after March 22, 1984, \nbut subsequently released from state control. \n40 \nDeShaney, 109 S.Ct. 998, does not support the proposition that persons who were in \nstate custody at the time of class certification and later released have no right to a \nremedy. There, the Supreme Court held that the due process clause does not require the \nstate to protect a child who is not in state custody from harm caused by his father. The \nCourt specifically distinguished Youngberg by pointing out that the state does have a \nduty to provide services when it restrains a person's liberty through institutionalization. \nSee 109 S.Ct. at 1005-06. Here all members of the class were institutionalized patients \non the date of certification. The evidence discloses that in some instances treatment \nrecommended by professionals, which would have satisfied the constitutional \nrequirements explained in Youngberg, was either not implemented or implemented \nimproperly resulting in harm to the patients. In other instances the treatment Youngberg \ncontemplated was not even recommended. The district court sought to remedy the harm \nsuffered by class members whether they remained in the institution or had been \ndischarged. The object of the court's order is twofold: to ameliorate the lingering effects, \nif any, of improper treatment; and to remedy inappropriate community placements, if \nany, such as those described in Thomas II, 781 F.2d at 372-73, that were not anticipated \nby professionals in the institutions. We believe that the state's duty to render the kind of \n\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \ntreatment prescribed by Youngberg is not discharged by simply releasing a class member \nfrom the institution where he or she had been hospitalized. Otherwise the state could \nunilaterally avoid the obligations imposed by Youngberg and Thomas II and defeat the \nclaims of class members by terminating their institutional care while the case was \npending. There is no evidence that state officials have acted with this improper motive, \nbut surely the class members who were discharged after the class was certified are \nentitled to the consideration due those class members who remain in the institutions. \n41 \nFurthermore, we note that the district court's definition of the class is only a practical \nstarting point for identifying the persons needing help. If the class members have not \nbeen injured by constitutionally inadequate treatment in the past or are currently \nreceiving minimally adequate treatment in appropriate placements, their present \nsituation need not be disturbed. A special master will be available to hear disputes and \nmake recommendations about the present condition of class members who have been \ndischarged. The district court retains jurisdiction to modify its order. \nIV \n42 \nThe Secretary argues that remedial treatment awarded to persons no longer in state \ncustody is compensation for a past violation of law and thus falls into the category of \nretroactive relief forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment. \n43 \nThe district court's decree does not run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment. The court \ndid not award monetary damages to any class member in contravention of the principles \nexplained in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). The \ncourt did not order injunctive relief simply to compensate for past violations of a \npatient's constitutional rights. Thus, if a patient had been previously subjected to \nunconstitutional conditions but presently was not affected by past unconstitutional \npractices, the Secretary was not required to provide remedial treatment. \n44 \nThe court's decree provides only prospective relief to class members who were in a \nhospital on the date the class was certified or who subsequently were admitted to a \nhospital. The decree addresses the present needs of the patients. Class members \ndischarged from the hospitals while this action was pending are entitled, under the \ndecree, to the constitutional protection delineated in Youngberg in accordance with the \nstandards adopted by the Supreme Court. See 457 U.S. at 314-25, 102 S.Ct. at 2457-63. If \nthe present conditions under which class members live do not meet constitutional \nrequirements as explained in Youngberg, or if a patient is presently suffering from \nunconstitutional conditions imposed while in the hospital, the decree provides \nappropriate prospective relief. The decree fully comports with the remedy approved in \nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977), and Clark v. \nCohen, 794 F.2d 79 (3d Cir.1986). \nV \n45 \n\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \nThe Secretary argues that the appointment of a special master was an abuse of \ndiscretion. In his view, the district court erred by failing to specify the exceptional \ncircumstances warranting a master. He contends that no exceptional circumstances are \npresent. \n46 \nRule 53(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states in pertinent part: \"A \nreference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule.... [I]n actions to be tried \nwithout a jury, save in matters of account and of difficult computation of damages, a \nreference shall be made only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires \nit.\" \n47 \nThe court explicitly found that exceptional circumstances existed to warrant its \nappointment of a master. 699 F.Supp. at 1205. Although the court did not specify these \ncircumstances, the exceptional circumstances are clear from the findings of fact and \nconclusions of law. The class is large, and each class member requires individualized \nconsideration. The general responsibilities of the master are to hear and report on \ndisputes about inclusion in the class and the adequacy of treatment to those in the class. \n699 F.Supp. at 1207. The district court retains jurisdiction to modify the order as \nnecessary. Other courts have appointed special masters in institutional reform cases \nsuch as this involving a large class of plaintiffs. See, e.g., Ruiz v. Estelle, 679 F.2d 1115, \n1159-63 (5th Cir.1982), amended in part on another issue on rehearing, 688 F.2d 266 \n(5th Cir.1982); Gary W. v. Louisiana, 601 F.2d 240, 245 (5th Cir.1979). \n48 \nThe facts of La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., 352 U.S. 249, 77 S.Ct. 309, 1 L.Ed.2d 290 \n(1957), cited by the Secretary as support for the proposition that the district court abused \nits discretion in appointing a master, are quite different. There, the district court referred \nantitrust cases to a master before liability was determined because the cases were \ncomplex and would take too much time to try. 352 U.S. at 252-54, 77 S.Ct. at 311-12. The \nSupreme Court stated that the reference to a master \"amounted to little less than an \nabdication of the judicial function depriving the parties of a trial before the court on the \nbasic issues involved in the litigation.\" 352 U.S. at 256, 77 S.Ct. at 313. In contrast, the \nparties here have had a trial and a decision on the merits by the district court. We hold \nthat the appointment of a special master for the remedial stage of this case was justified \nby exceptional circumstances for implementation of the court's decree. \nVI \n49 \nThe Secretary's final argument is that the findings of facts adopted by the district court \nare clearly erroneous. He claims that numerous findings of fact have no basis in the \nrecord. He contends that the fact finding process was flawed because the court did not \ndefer to professional judgment as required by Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 307, 102 S.Ct. at \n2452. He argues that the court ignored substantial evidence rebutting the testimony of \nthe class members' witnesses. \n50 \n\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \nInitially, we reject the Secretary's suggestion that we apply a heightened standard of \nreview because the district court adopted the class members' proposed findings of facts \nand conclusions of law. The court described the process it followed in reviewing the \nproposed findings as follows: \n51 \nIn this case the court did not simply adopt plaintiffs' proposed findings verbatim. After \ntrial, both sides submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. After \nreviewing the proposals and the entire record, the court tentatively concluded that \nplaintiffs should prevail and adopted plaintiffs' proposal as the first draft of an opinion. \nThe court then spent many hours checking and editing plaintiffs' proposal to insure that \nthe final draft of the opinion was faithful to the evidence as a whole. \n52 \nApp. 267. An argument similar to the Secretary's complaint was rejected by the \nSupreme Court in Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 571-73, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1510-\n11, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). \n53 \nWe find that the record supports the district court's findings. Further, the court \nproperly followed the standards of Youngberg in making its factual findings. Finally, we \nreject the Secretary's argument that the court ignored rebuttal evidence. The court \nlistened to testimony and reviewed extensive documentary evidence and deposition \ntestimony. It is the role of the district court, not this court, to weigh the evidence and \njudge the credibility of the witnesses. See Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 52(a); Anderson, 470 U.S. at \n573-76, 105 S.Ct. at 1511-13. \nVII \n54 \nIn conclusion, we note that to be effective, the injunction must be implemented in a \npractical way by both parties in the remedial phase of the lawsuit. At oral argument, \ncounsel for the parties indicated that before proceedings were stayed pending appeal \nthey had constructive meetings about implementing the order. We encourage the parties \nto continue this progress toward resolving the details of the remedial phase in a manner \nthat will be practical, efficient, and compassionate, having due regard for the authority of \nthe Secretary to care for patients in accordance with accepted professional standards and \nthe right of the patients to the protection that the Constitution affords them. \n\t\r  \n\t\r  ",

Gage, Cox & Gage, Morganton, N.C., for\ndefendants.\nORDER\nMcMILLAN, District Judge.\nI.\nPaul Caldwell, next friend of plaintiff Thomas S., filed this suit on July 7, 1982, seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief for Thomas S. under federal and state law. Paul Caldwell later became employed by defendants, and Joyce\nBrooks now serves as next friend.\nThomas S., a twenty-year-old Gaston County resident, has been diagnosed as suffering from, inter alia,\nschizophrenia and borderline mental retardation, and is incapable of either living independently or managing his\nown affairs. Given up for adoption at birth, Tom spent his first eighteen years in approximately forty different foster\nhomes and institutions while in the custody of the Gaston County Department of Social Services (DSS). DSS\n1057 shuffled Tom through so many placements during *1057 his youth (see deposition of Dannette Rosenberg, pp.\n10-15) because there were no appropriate community-based treatment facilities available in Gaston County\nduring this period (defendant Morrow's answer, ¶ 17; defendant Carpenter's answer, ¶ 13).\nSoon after Tom's eighteenth birthday, DSS succeeded in having Tom declared legally incompetent, and\ndefendant Allen Childress, Regional Adult Mental Health Specialist of the Department of Human Resources\n(DHR), Division of Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse Services, was thereafter appointed\nguardian under the authority of N.C.G.S. §§ 122-24.1 and 35-1.28. Because Childress considered Tom's then-\ncurrent placement inappropriate, Childress caused Tom to be admitted to the \"R\" (mental retardation) unit at\nBroughton Hospital on March 15, 1982.\nFour months after Tom was institutionalized at Broughton, his next friend brought this suit against state and local\nofficials seeking judicial declaration that Tom's rights under the United States Constitution and under state law\nhad been denied by defendants, and seeking prospective injunctive relief to remedy the alleged wrong. The\n\ncomplaint alleged that, under federal and state law, Tom is entitled to more appropriate treatment of his condition\nin a less restrictive, community-based setting. On May 26, 1983, plaintiff and two of the local defendants agreed\nto a special treatment plan funded by those defendants which provided appropriate community-based treatment\nfor Tom until March 1, 1984. That agreement was incorporated into a judgment, and, because of that judgment,\nthe court deferred ruling on all parties' motions for summary judgment. The court designated the case as inactive\nuntil February 1, 1984. Since the consent judgment was filed, Tom has been shifted to at least three additional\nplacements. He is now being housed in the Gaston County detoxification facility because there is no place else\nfor him to go. Letter from plaintiff's counsel, Edward G. Connette (filed August 29, 1984).\nMeanwhile, the parties, and others, have filed a number of additional motions. All parties have renewed their\nmotions for summary judgment. Other mentally impaired persons have moved that they be allowed to intervene,\nand have joined plaintiff in a motion to amend the complaint and to certify a class. The local defendants have\nmoved that, in the event a statewide class is certified, all claims against the local defendants be severed from the\nclass action case.\nOn August 15, 1984, the court heard argument on those motions.\nII.\nAll pendent state law claims should be dismissed. Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, ___ U.S.\n___, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), is dispositive of those claims. Pennhurst held that the Eleventh\nAmendment prohibits federal courts from adjudicating pendent claims against state officials based on those\nofficials' alleged violations of state law.\nAlso in Pennhurst, however, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the established principle that federal courts do have\njurisdiction to grant relief against state officials based on those officials' alleged violations of federal law. Id., at\n___, 104 S.Ct. at 911; Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). \"[I]n such cases this\nCourt is vested with the constitutional duty to vindicate `the supreme authority of the United States'....\" Pennhurst,\n___ U.S. at ___, fn. 17, 104 S.Ct. at 912, fn. 17.\nIII.\nPlaintiff is entitled to summary judgment based on his constitutional claims against defendants.\nA\nPlaintiff claims that his liberty 00 a substantive right arising solely under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n97\n1058 Constitution 00has been denied by the defendants. The seminal case on this \"substantive due *1058 process\"\n97\nclaim is Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). Youngberg discussed \"the\nsubstantive rights of involuntarily committed mentally retarded persons under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution.\" Id., at 314, 102 S.Ct. at 2457.\nAlthough Youngberg discussed the constitutional rights of a severely retarded, institutionalized individual, the\nstandards outlined in that case are appropriate to this case. The parties are in dispute about whether Tom is\nmentally retarded, but they agree that he suffers from mental impairments which prevent him from living\nindependently and which necessitated the appointment of a guardian. Tom is not now institutionalized, but he\nwas so placed at the time the suit was filed, and, as a ward of the state, Tom at any time may be required to\nreturn to Broughton, if his guardian so directs. Therefore, Tom is like the plaintiff in Youngberg insofar as the state\nhas control over Tom's liberty and care.\nThe holding in Youngberg dictates that defendants Morrow and Childress are responsible for ensuring that\nplaintiff retains the liberty to which he is entitled solely under the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendant Childress,\nregional specialist for DHR, was plaintiff's guardian and caused plaintiff to be admitted to Broughton on March 15,\n\n1982. Defendant Morrow is Secretary of DHR and is responsible for the administration of DHR as well as the\nsupervision of county departments of social services.\nMorrow and Childress, like the institution officials in Youngberg, are responsible for the legitimate restraints on\nplaintiff's liberty resulting from plaintiff's mental incompetency and wardship; also like the defendants in \nYoungberg, Morrow and Childress are charged with the responsibility that these legitimate restraints are no more\nrestrictive than necessary.\nLiberty interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment include safety, liberty from bodily restraint, and\n\"minimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint.\" Id. at 319, 102\nS.Ct. at 2460.\nThe training to which plaintiff is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment is that which is \"reasonable\" in light of\nthe \"balance [between] `the liberty of the individual' and `the demands of an organized society.'\" Id. at 320, 102\nS.Ct. at 2460. \"In determining what is `reasonable' 00 in this and in any case presenting a claim for training by a\n97\nState 00 we emphasize that courts must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional.\" \n97\nId. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461.\nThe decision [to treat a certain way], if made by a professional, is presumptively valid; liability may\nbe imposed only when the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from\naccepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person\nresponsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\nId. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. This court, therefore, in determining the training or treatment to which plaintiff is\nentitled under the Fourteenth Amendment, must look for guidance to the professional judgment and decisions of\nthose who examined and treated him.\nDefendants recently have been filing affidavits asserting, at least in part, that plaintiff has a behavioral problem\nwhich makes it difficult to treat him. See, e.g., affidavit of James B. McKelvey, dated August 30, 1984; affidavit of\nRudy Cannon, dated August 27, 1984. The court fails to see how that fact can excuse defendants from providing\nthe treatment to which plaintiff is entitled. People with problems are rarely easy to deal with. If plaintiff were\n\"normal,\" then he would not need the treatment the professionals say he needs. The solution to whatever\nbehavioral problems plaintiff may have is not to place him inappropriately in a detoxification facility; it is to provide\nhim with appropriate treatment.\n1059 The overwhelming weight of professional opinion concerning the appropriate treatment *1059 needs of Thomas\nS. appears to be consistent with the recommendations formulated by the R Unit treatment team as set forth in the\npsychological evaluation dated November 22, 1982, and signed by Staff Psychologist William R. Wellborn, III:\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1. Placement in a group home with adults of average intelligence without severe emotional\ndifficulties (stable environment with structure)\n2. Counseling by both male and female therapists regarding conflicts in establishing relationships\nwith both men and women\n3. Needs exposure to many social situations outside of the institutional environment (e.g.\nshopping, dining out, short trips, etc.)\n4. Attend an Outward Bound Course (21-day course) to help develop his ego, strength, and self-\nconcept\n5. Placement in an environment that will allow the perfect balance between supervision and\nfreedom so that Tom will not feel rejected\n6. Training in mathematics and money management\n\n7. Training in a specific trade like auto mechanics so that Tom will more likely be able to support\nhimself in the future\nDefendant Morrow's Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, or Alternatively, Motion for Judgment on the\nPleadings or, Alternatively, Motion for Summary Judgment, Exhibit 7, page 9 (March 31, 1983). Details of the\nrecommended appropriate treatment vary according to the professional making the assessment, but the basic,\ncommon elements appear to be:\n1. A stable environment 00 i.e., a relatively permanent placement.\n97\n2. A non-institutional adult foster care situation which would allow Tom to function as a family\nmember with some supervision but with relatively few restrictions.\n3. Basic educational training and vocational training.\n4. Therapy and counseling.\nSee, e.g., Affidavit of Rudy Cannon (filed August 30, 1984).\nDefendants have filed a large number of affidavits which, defendants claim, show that the haphazard,\ninconsistent treatment provided for plaintiff was consistent with the recommendations of professionals. See, e.g.,\naffidavits attached to defendant Morrow's Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, or Alternatively, Motion\nfor Judgment on the Pleadings or, Alternatively, Motion for Summary Judgment (filed March 31, 1983). However,\nscrutiny of those affidavits, coupled with an examination of the deposition excerpts and affidavits submitted by\nplaintiff, shows that most of the treatment provided for plaintiff was not consistent with that recommended by the\nprofessionals. See, e.g., affidavits of Paul Caldwell, Dr. Jacelyn Wedell-Monnig, Dr. Carolyn Schroeder and\ndepositions of Allen Childress (pp. 11-12, 37-39, 93) and Benjamin Carpenter (p. 12) (filed May 6, 1983). To the\nextent that any professionally prescribed treatment differed from that set forth above, it differed because the\nprofessional's stated judgment was modified to conform to the available treatment, rather than to the appropriate\ntreatment, for plaintiff's condition.\nLack of funding or of established alternatives is not a factor which may be considered in determining the scope of\nthis constitutional right. Of course, that factor is critical in determining whether damages may be recovered by\none who was denied his right to appropriate treatment.\nIn an action for damages against a professional in his individual capacity, however, the\nprofessional will not be liable if he was unable to satisfy his normal professional standards\nbecause of budgetary constraints; in such a situation, goodfaith immunity would bar liability.\n1060 Youngberg, at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. Just as certainly, however, consideration of budgetary *1060 constraints is\nnot proper when defining this constitutional right. To the extent that a professional's judgment of the appropriate\ntreatment is shown to have been modified to fit what is available, that judgment likely has become \"a substantial\ndeparture from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards.\" The Supreme Court in Youngberg\nrecognized that \"normal professional standards\" (or professional judgment) and \"budgetary constraints\" are\nseparate concepts (\"the professional will not be liable if he was unable to satisfy his normal professional\nstandards because of budgetary constraints\" Id., at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 [emphasis added]).\nNor are budgetary constraints restrictive of a court's equitable authority and power in fashioning prospective relief\nafter determining that this constitutional right has been violated. See, e.g., Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387,\n394 (M.D.Ala. 1972),affirmed in part, remanded in part and decision reversed in part sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt,\n503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974). Accord, Scott v. Plante, 691 F.2d 634, 637 (3d Cir.1982):\nObviously the problem of hindsight interference with decisions made by hardpressed professional\nstaff members of state mental institutions is a more serious one than that of assisting them in\ndirecting prospective injunctive relief against appropriate state officials. See Edelman v. Jordan,\n415 U.S. 651, 667, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1357, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that defendants Morrow and Childress have denied and continue\nto deny plaintiff his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiff is entitled to treatment recommended by\nqualified professionals whose judgment is unsullied by consideration of the fact that the state does not now\nprovide appropriate treatment or funding for appropriate treatment.\nPlaintiff is therefore entitled to prospective injunctive relief.\nB\nPlaintiff also claims his state-created liberty interests 00 i.e., those conferred on plaintiff by North Carolina law 00\n97 97\nwere taken from him by defendants without due process of law, and, thus, in violation of his rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In particular, plaintiff claims that the North Carolina General Statutes,\n§§ 35-1.6 et seq., (the North Carolina Guardianship Act); § 122-55.8, (the Continuity of Care Statute); §\n143B-137; and § 168-1 create liberty interests which may not be deprived without due process of law. In support\nof this \"procedural due process\" claim, plaintiff cites Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d\n684 (1976); Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 488, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 1261, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980); and Greenholtz v.\nNebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2103, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). (State-created liberty\ninterests, like federally derived constitutional rights, trigger the procedural protections of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.)\nDefendants assert that this claim is foreclosed by Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, supra.\nPennhurst, however, does not go so far. Pennhurst held only that federal courts may not exercise pendent\njurisdiction to adjudicate claims of state law violations against state officials. A \"procedural due process\" claim is\nan entirely different sort of action. The role of state law in this constitutional claim is merely to define the liberty\ninterest at stake. In order to prevail, plaintiff must show that his procedural rights under the Constitution were not\nprovided when the state took away plaintiff's state-created right to a particular form of liberty. Such a suit, then, is\nnot an enforcement of state law, but an enforcement of federal constitutional law. As the Court said in Pennhurst,\n\"[I]n such cases this Court is vested with the constitutional duty to vindicate `the supreme authority of the United\nStates'....\" Pennhurst, ___ U.S. at ___, fn. 17, 104 S.Ct. at 912, fn. 17.\n1061 *1061 Plaintiff argues that this cause of action entitles him to the same prospective relief afforded under his\n\"substantive due process\" claim, since the \"professional judgment\" of those who have treated plaintiff is that he\nshould be placed in a less-restrictive, community setting with enriching treatment. Defendants deny that many of\nthe statutes even apply to plaintiff. They also say that, even if the statutes apply, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\nSince the court already has determined that plaintiff is entitled to relief based on his rights derived solely from the\nFourteenth Amendment, the court need not reach this second constitutional claim for relief asserted by plaintiff.\nThe court recognizes that state and local defendants, rather than just defendants Morrow and Childress, would\nshare responsibilities should plaintiff recover on his second constitutional claim. The court will not speculate,\nhowever, on who might be responsible when it is clear that Morrow and Childress are responsible on the basis of\nplaintiff's first constitutional claim.\nFor the reasons set forth above, IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that:\n1. The pendent state law claims are DISMISSED without prejudice.\n2. Summary judgment for plaintiff Thomas S. is ALLOWED to the extent set forth above.\n3. Counsel for plaintiff and defendants Morrow and Childress shall confer and attempt to propose, within ten (10)\ndays, a judgment which includes a treatment program for Thomas S. based on \"professional judgment\"\nconsistent with this order. Counsel should inform the court within that time frame whether they are able to reach\nan agreement.\n4. The claims against defendants Benjamin Carpenter, Melton, Gaston, Beam, Hollifield, Forrester, Dean\nCarpenter, Heavner, and McAteer are DISMISSED without prejudice.\n\n5. The court defers judgment on the issues of\n(a) intervention of other plaintiffs,\n(b) amendment of plaintiff's complaint, and\n(c) certification of a class action.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

PER CURIAM: \nTHOMAS S., by his guardian ad litem, Joyce M.  *1 This case arises from class-action litigation in which \nBrooks; Jeanette H.; Todd C.; Phillip B.; Margaret  the North Carolina Department of Human Resources was \nR., by her guardian ad litem, Curtis Venable, on  earlier found to have deprived mentally retarded adults in \nbehalf of themselves and all others similarly  its care of their constitutional rights to safe conditions of \nsituated, Plaintiffs-Appellees,  confinement,  freedom  from  undue  restraint,  and \nv.  minimally adequate treatment. Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 \nDavid T. FLAHERTY, Secretary, North Carolina  F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1986).

He has been confined to \nCounty Commissioners, to wit: Harley B. Gaston,  state custody in Broughton State Psychiatric Hospital on a \nJr., David Beam, David Hollifield, James  number of separate occasions since 1984. The district \nForrester, Dean Carpenter, Robert Heavner,  court found that on two of those occasions, in 1984 and \nPorter McAteet, Defendants.  again in 1985, A.P. was involuntarily committed on the \nbasis  of  separate  diagnoses  of  mental  retardation  and \nNo. 93-1018. | Argued: June 10, 1993. | Decided: \naccompanying behavioral disorders. These misdiagnoses \nJuly 15, 1993. \nwere  provided  to  the  state  courts  to  justify  A.P.’s \ninvoluntary  commitment  on  the  first  occasion  and \npossibly the second. The diagnoses were later corrected \nAppeal  from  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the \neach time, and A.P. was not clinically treated as being \nWestern District of North Carolina, at Charlotte.

The \nGeneral,  NORTH  CAROLINA  DEPARTMENT  OF  district court defined as a class member “someone who is: \nJUSTICE, Raleigh, North Carolina, for Appellant.  1) over the age of 18; 2) has been confined to a State \nmental hospital at any time since March 22, 1984; and 3) \nRoger  Todd  Manus,  CAROLINA  LEGAL  is  ‘mentally  retarded  or[has]  been  treated  as  mentally \nASSISTANCE, Raleigh, North Carolina, for Appellees.  retarded.’ Thomas S. v.

The district court \nreviewed the findings of the Special Master and affirmed \nW.D.N.C. \nthe determination that A.P. had been treated as mentally \n  \nretarded. \nAFFIRMED. \n  \n  \nThe Department contends that the district court erred in \nfinding  that  A.P.  was  treated  as  mentally  retarded. \nBefore ERVIN, Chief Judge, and MURNAGHAN and \n  1 \n \n\nThomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 998 F.2d 1010 (1993)   \n \nAccording to the Department, the diagnoses of A.P. that  have the third criterion for class membership read “treated \nled to his involuntary commitment were merely tentative  clinically  as  mentally  retarded,”  we  do  not  think  the \nand he was never placed in the mental retardation unit at  district  court  was  obliged  to  amend  or  interpret  the \nBroughton.

Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). In Youngberg the Court recognized\n369 that a patient in a state mental institution has a right to \"adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.\" *369\n457 U.S. at 315, 102 S.Ct. at 315. Youngberg also established that a mentally retarded person involuntarily\ncommitted to a state institution retains liberty interests secured by the due process clause of the fourteenth\namendment in \"safety and freedom from bodily restraint.\" 457 U.S. at 319, 102 S.Ct. at 2459. These liberty\ninterests \"require the State to provide minimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure safety and freedom\nfrom undue restraint.\" 457 U.S. at 319, 102 S.Ct. at 2459. The Court explained that to determine what training \"is\n`reasonable' 00 in this and in any case presenting a claim for training by a State 00 we emphasize that courts must\n97 97\nshow deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional.\" 457 U.S. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461.\nAlthough the facts of this case differ from those in Youngberg, we conclude that the district court did not err by\nturning to Youngberg for guidance. The district court held that the state should implement a training or treatment\n\nplan prescribed by its own professionals for a young incompetent adult who, from birth, has been a ward of the\nstate or of a guardian appointed by the state. Finding no cause for reversal in the assignments of error, we affirm\n[1]\nthe order of the district court with but slight modification.\nI\nThomas S. was placed for adoption by his mother at his birth in 1963. The Gaston County, North Carolina,\ndepartment of social services took custody of him until his eighteenth birthday, when he was adjudged\nincompetent and a guardian was appointed for him. All told, he has lived in more than 40 foster homes and\ninstitutions.\nSoon after Thomas was born, hospital personnel told the county social worker responsible for Thomas's\nplacement that he was hyperactive and required a \"special home to meet [his] needs.\" Thomas was placed with a\nlicensed foster mother when he was six days old. He lived with her for about five and a half years, until his foster\nmother \"could no longer handle Tom's problems.\" He then lived in a second foster home for five months. The\nfoster parents asked that he be removed because he bit and clawed the other children and was unable to share,\ndemanding full attention from the foster parents. Thomas was then placed in a group home for disturbed children.\nHe was removed five months later, according to the department of social services, because the group home\n\"could not meet Tom's needs. There was no treatment for him....\" In September 1969 Thomas was moved to an\ninstitution for emotionally disturbed children, where he remained for one year. There he received therapy and\nlearned to control his inappropriate behavior so he could reside in a less restrictive environment. In September\n1970 he was placed in Children's Home of Winston-Salem, where he remained until 1978. During this time, at\nleast four different sets of foster parents gave him occasional respite care.\nIn February 1977, when Thomas was 13, the social services department decided to reunite him with his mother.\nAlthough his mother initially wanted Thomas to live with her, during his visit she decided that she could not cope\nwith him because he was jealous of her other children and physically abused them. He also had tantrums in\nwhich he screamed obscenities. Thomas went back to Children's Home and did not see his mother again.\nIt then became more difficult to cope with Thomas's behavior. He retreated into his own world of model cars, and\nhe attempted suicide several times. In September 1978 he was placed in a receiving home in Gaston County and\nat the end of that month was placed in Broughton Hospital, one of North Carolina's state mental institutions. He\n370 remained there for over a year. At his discharge from Broughton Hospital in February of 1980, Thomas's *370\npsychiatrist recommended that he be placed in \"a less restrictive setting in the community,\" preferably \"a group\nhome and perhaps later, a halfway house.\" From February until April 1980, Thomas lived in a group home for\nemotionally disturbed children. The home requested that he be removed because he frequently ran away and he\nupset the other children. For the next four weeks, Thomas was housed \"in a piece-meal fashion here and there,\"\naccording to the county department of social services. By May 12, \"we had no other place to turn and we brought\nhim to Broughton.\" At his discharge from Broughton in June 1980, the psychiatrist directing the unit that had\ncared for him reported that the \"[s]taff in all areas affirmed need for Tom to be in less restrictive and less\ndependent place.... [I]t was felt community placement and outpatient mental health support were appropriate to\nmeet his needs.\" At Thomas's discharge, he was placed in an emergency shelter in Iredell County and eventually\nwith another foster family.\nIn June 1981 he was returned to Broughton Hospital, but he was discharged in about a week at his own request\nand against medical advice. Thomas was then placed at Gerald's Lazy Acres Rest Home for the elderly, where\nhe lived from June 1981 through March 1982.\nThomas reached 18 while living at Lazy Acres, and Gaston County began proceedings to have him declared\nincompetent. His guardian ad litem sought a psychological and social evaluation of Thomas at the division for\ndisorders of development and learning at North Carolina Memorial Hospital. Psychologists evaluated Thomas's\nmental functioning as being on the borderline between average intelligence and mild mental retardation. His\nsocial functioning was evaluated as being at \"a much lower level,\" in the moderately mentally retarded range. The\nsocial worker on the evaluation team noted that Thomas had \"experienced multiple changes in his social\n\nenvironment\" in the past ten years. \"While a variety of services have been provided him, coordinated planning of\nservices has been difficult and there has been no therapeutic situation available for any length of time since his\nearly adolescence.\" Consequently, \"Tom has lacked for consistent significant persons in his life.\" The evaluation\nteam concluded that Thomas \"needs a stable, very structured environment for three to six years\" that would give\nhim \"consistency in his social contacts\" so that he could \"develop trust in interpersonal relationships.\" Specifically,\nhe needed vocational training, training in social skills, \"opportunities for social interaction with peers,\" and\n\"opportunities to practice in the community the skills he already has and those he will be acquiring before he is\ndischarged from this supervised environment.\" He \"might join a club, participate in structured physical education\nactivities, attend dances or social events.\" The team summarized: \"In planning for Tom, his psychosocial\nmaladjustment is the critical issue that must be addressed.\"\nThomas was adjudged incompetent. In February 1982 Allen Childress, regional adult mental health specialist with\nthe North Carolina department of human resources, was appointed Thomas's guardian. The guardian visited\nThomas at Lazy Acres and decided that the rest home was an inappropriate placement. The guardian later\ncommented on Thomas's condition at the time: \"He weighed 197 pounds and was taking five separate\nmedications, which effectively subdued his personality. He was the only person of his age in that rest home. He\nhad no peers in the rest home. He had no social or recreational or educational or vocational opportunities, and no\naccess to therapeutic counselling.\" Sleeping, eating, and listening to the radio were Thomas's main activities at\nLazy Acres. He gained at least 25 pounds and became emotionally unstable and hallucinatory. He withdrew\nagain into his world of model cars.\nThe guardian transferred him to the mental retardation unit at Broughton Hospital, in part to enable the guardian\n371 to assess Thomas's needs and to enable Gaston County to identify resources to meet *371 those needs. A few\nweeks after Thomas's admission to Broughton Hospital, a team of social workers, occupational therapists, and\npsychologists devised his treatment plan.\nThe team feels Tom should be ready for community placement in Gaston County in three to six\nmonths. He would be able to live successfully in a co-ed group home for adults (ages 13 to 35)\nwith a Vocational Rehabilitation Sheltered Workshop ... or in a CETA on-the-job training program\n... during the day.... Counseling through the Department of Social Services and mental health to\naddress medication needs, behavior problems, if they arise, and emotional needs would be\nrequired periodically. The home environment would need to be somewhat structured during non-\nwork hours to provide activities therapeutic to Tom's needs and related to his interests (cars,\ntrucks, fishing, bike riding, outdoors activities).\n* * * * * *\nTom basically needs to be a part of a home where he can establish family ties in order to mature\nand develop through the natural progression of growing up to adulthood. He was hardly ever in\nany one place long enough to put down any roots.\nOn June 2, 1982, six weeks after Thomas's admission to Broughton, the Broughton social worker on Thomas's\ntreatment team wrote to the Gaston-Lincoln mental health agency to advise it of Thomas's needs upon his\nanticipated discharge on June 17:\nWe have identified the following needs as priority:\n1. Community-based living either in a group home or adult foster care home\n2. Sheltered Workshop activities or some type of daily vocational training activity\n3. Involvement with the local mental health center for medication review and counseling to\nimprove his self-concept/self-esteem\nThe team feels that Tom basically needs to be a part of a home where he can establish\nmeaningful relationships and that will provide sufficient structure to allow him to mature and\ndevelop through a natural progression to adulthood. The team feels that in two to five years, Tom\n\nshould be able to live in a semi-independent or independent living situation in the community after\nthis maturation process has been completed. The home environment should be structured during\nnon-work hours to provide activities responsive to Tom's needs and related to his interests (cars,\ntrucks, fishing, bicycle riding, and outdoor activities).\nThomas was not released on June 17 as planned. In fact, he was not released until March of the following year.\nUpon receiving the Broughton social worker's recommendation, the director of the Gaston-Lincoln agency\nadvised the social worker and Thomas's guardian that the mental health agency could offer only outpatient\ncounseling, not residential services. The guardian responded that because of \"the obvious inability of the\ncommunity to care for Tom at this time, I agreed to recommend the continuation of the commitment to give\nGaston County extended time to identify resources appropriate to Tom's need.\"\nIn October 1982 the hospital social worker contacted the Gaston County department of social services with a\nrecommendation similar to that previously sent to the mental health agency:\nWe recommend that Tom be placed in an MR [mental retardation] group home or other highly\nstructured environment for an extended period of time in order to gain the ability to live\nindependently in the community. Placement of choice is a mental retardation group home for high-\nfunctioning males which has an Adult Day Activities Program/Workshop capability. This home\nshould be located in an area which is both willing and able to provide counseling services and\nmedication review for Tom.\nIn November 1982 a two-day psychological evaluation was made by the North Carolina division of mental health\n372 and mental *372 services at Broughton Hospital for the purpose of \"determining Tom's needs for community\nplacement.\" The team of psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists assessed Thomas's weaknesses as his\nlack of self-direction and his lack of socialization skills. The reporting psychologist explained that \"the reason for\nthese deficits is lack of motivation, lack of freedom with appropriate supervision, and the numerous placements\nwhich have resulted in a lack of continuity in training.\" Thomas's score on intelligence tests had improved to the\n\"dull normal\" level of intelligence, and the team concluded that Thomas should no longer be diagnosed as\nmentally retarded. The psychologist also noted that his social maturity score had improved since the evaluation\nmade one year previously at North Carolina Memorial Hospital. The psychologist attributed this improvement to\n\"the fact that he has been in a stable environment\" for the past eight months.\nThe nine-page evaluation concluded with seven specific recommendations.\n1. Placement in a group home with adults of average intelligence without severe emotional\ndifficulties (stable environment with structure)\n2. Counseling by both male and female therapists regarding conflicts in establishing relationships\nwith both men and women\n3. Needs exposure to many social situations outside of the institutional environment (e.g.\nshopping, dining out, short trips, etc.)\n4. Attend an Outward Bound Course (21-day course) to help develop his ego, strength, and self-\nconcept.\n5. Placement in an environment that will allow the perfect balance between supervision and\nfreedom so that Tom will not feel rejected\n6. Training in mathematics and money management\n7. Training in a specific trade like auto mechanics so that Tom will more likely be able to support\nhimself in the future[.]\nOn November 24, 1982, the Broughton staff devised a discharge plan for Thomas, prefacing it with the evaluation\nthat \"he has reached his maximum functioning level within Unit R [the mental retardation unit] and now needs\nfurther services in a more normal setting to develop his capabilities.\" The staff changed Thomas's diagnosis from\n\nmild retardation to \"adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features\" and noted that \"Tom is extremely aware\nthat he is living with mentally retarded individuals and often voices his thoughts of not wanting to be around\n`those retarded people.' We feel this is a normal and healthy reaction to being housed in this situation.\" The staff\nreiterated its view that institutional placement was not right for him. \"The team feels Tom has received maximum\nbenefit from training and counseling in the institutional setting and is now ready for community placement. Tom\nno longer requires custodial care in an institutional level, and continued provision of this would be inappropriate.\"\nThe staff made three recommendations for Tom's residential placement:\nThe desired placement for him would seem to be an adult foster care situation in which he would\nlive in a family home with parents who could provide the love and caring and structure that Tom\nneeds to complete the maturation process toward adulthood. He will need Adult Basic Education\nclasses several hours a day and vocational training classes to prepare him for competitive\nemployment. Tom needs assertiveness training to improve his self-concept. This could be possibly\naccomplished through a three-week course at the Outward Bound School.\nA second choice of the team for placement would be a group home for normal adults with a\nstructured environment consisting of the education classes, work skills training, and somewhat\nstructured leisure time. A third choice of placement would be a family care home providing similar\nservices.\n373 *373 Thomas was released from Broughton on March 3, 1983.[2] For the next nine months he lived with a foster\nfamily in Cleveland County. According to his guardian,\n[Thomas] functioned as a family member, performing household chores, shopping, and personal\ncare tasks. He completed an internship in training as a nursing home attendant. He participated in\nkarate classes, the Boys Club, and other community activities. He developed friends in the\ncommunity outside of his foster home.\nTom maintained himself in good physical condition, improved his general appearance through\nincreased grooming and improved clothing, and maintained his weight loss.\nThomas became upset, however, upon being required to have a roommate and upon meeting members of his\nbiological family. Thomas announced his decision to live with his sister, who did not agree to the plan. Thomas\nthen decided to leave the foster home, and a magistrate committed him to Broughton Hospital.\nAfter two weeks at Broughton, he was placed in the McCay group home for developmentally disabled adults in\nMorganton, where he remained for about five months. He became upset with his roommate and moved out to the\nhome's two-car garage. He also ran away several times and requested the Burke County department of social\nservices to investigate his living situation.\nOn May 19, 1984, Thomas was placed at a rest home in Wilkes County that housed elderly and emotionally ill\nadults. Day treatment was available to him at a center several miles from the rest home. Thomas remained at the\nrest home for three months. In August 1984 he was moved to the Gaston County detoxification and night care\nfacility, where he was living at the time of the district court's entry of final judgment on December 7, 1984.\nII\nOn July 7, 1982, four months after Thomas's second commitment to Broughton Hospital, Thomas S. by his next\nfriend brought this suit against Sarah Morrow, Secretary of the North Carolina department of human resources;\nAllen Childress, in his official capacity as Thomas's guardian; and the directors of two local agencies, the Gaston\nCounty department of social services and the Gaston-Lincoln area mental health program. An amended\ncomplaint joined as additional defendants the Gaston County commissioners.\nThe complaint alleged that the defendants had denied Thomas substantive due process accorded by the\nfourteenth amendment. It protested the defendants' failure to provide minimally adequate treatment, alleging that\nThomas's hospitalization imposed a degree of restraint on his liberty inconsistent with professional judgment\n\nconcerning his appropriate treatment. It also charged that the defendants had deprived him of liberty interests\ncreated by state law. Thomas requested an injunction ordering the defendants to place him in an appropriate\ngroup home and to provide other treatment recommended by the professionals who had examined and worked\nwith him.\nOn May 26, 1983, the court entered a consent order permitting the two local agencies named as defendants to\ncontract with an independent nonprofit organization for foster care and treatment from the date of Thomas's\ndischarge from Broughton until March 1, 1984. Because of the consent order, the court deferred all parties'\nmotions for summary judgment and declared the case inactive until February 1, 1984.\nUpon reactivating the case and considering further motions, the district court on September 18, 1984, ruled on\ncross motions for summary judgment. The court dismissed all pendent state law claims against state officials, in\naccordance with Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67\n374 (1984). The court also dismissed without prejudice the claims against the local officials. It granted summary *374\njudgment against the Secretary of the department of human resources and Thomas's guardian.\nOn December 7, 1984, the court entered a judgment requiring the Secretary and the guardian to develop a\ntreatment plan and appoint a case manager for Thomas. It directed them to furnish Thomas the treatment\nrecommended by the qualified professionals who had evaluated his needs. In accordance with the\nrecommendations, the order specified that Thomas should be placed in a \"stable suitable supervised community\nresidential placement such as: (1) a non-institutional specialized adult foster care situation ... or (2) a group home\nwith adults of average intelligence.\" Adhering to the recommendations, the court also directed that Thomas\nshould be provided nonresidential services such as mental health counseling, adult basic education and\nvocational training, and \"opportunities for community interaction.\" The Secretary and the guardian appealed.\nIII\nThe Secretary contends that she has not violated Thomas's \"fourteenth amendment right to liberty of movement\nand freedom from restraint.\" She advances several reasons for reversing the district court's order. She asserts\nthat Youngberg is inapplicable because Thomas, in her words, \"lives in the community and is not subject to the\ncontrol of the state,\" and because in any event he has received minimally adequate treatment consistent with\nprofessional judgment. She also contends that, because Thomas is not in a state institution, North Carolina law\nplaces responsibility for him on local authorities and not on her department. Finally, she says that the district court\nerred in granting summary judgment because the record disclosed genuine issues of material fact.\nThere are, of course, differences between Youngberg and Thomas's case. In Youngberg the court dealt with a\nclaim for damages against state officials for breach of constitutional rights. 457 U.S. at 311, 102 S.Ct. at 2455.\nThomas does not sue for money; he seeks only the treatment that professionals at a state hospital have\nprescribed. But this distinction between the cases does not militate against Thomas. The principles undergirding\nthe Court's decision in the action for damages afford a sound foundation for the exercise of equitable powers to\nfashion remedial, prospective relief. See Scott v. Plante, 691 F.2d 634, 637 (3d Cir.1982). Much of Youngberg\nnecessarily addresses the situation of a single patient confined to an institution, but the Court did not intend the\nliberty interests it identified to be limited to these circumstances. The liberty interests protected in Youngberg did\nnot arise because of the institutional confinement. Rather, the Court's premise was that involuntary commitment\nand other lawful confinement \"do not extinguish\" pre-existing liberty interests in safety and freedom from bodily\nrestraint. 457 U.S. at 315, 102 S.Ct. at 2457.\nAlthough during the course of this litigation Thomas's lodging has changed from a state hospital to a night care\nunit at a detoxification center, his status has not changed. He remains a legally incompetent adult who is a ward\nof a guardian appointed by the state. He did not choose to live at the detoxification center, and he is neither an\nalcoholic nor a drug addict. Youngberg does not suggest that an incompetent person sheds the basic liberty\ninterests that the Court identified when state officials and his guardian move him from one facility to another.\nIn Youngberg, the Court recognized that it is not feasible to specify the type of training for every case.\nNevertheless, it explained principles that are broad enough to govern diverse factual situations. With respect to a\n\nstate's duty to provide training, the Court said: \"The basic requirement of adequacy ... may be stated as that\ntraining which is reasonable in light of identifiable liberty interests and the circumstances of the case.\" The Court\ncoupled this definition with the admonition to \"identify a constitutional predicate for the imposition of any\n375 affirmative duty on a *375 State.\" 457 U.S. at 319 n. 25, 102 S.Ct. at 2460 n. 25. Moreover, the Court\nemphasized that in determining what is reasonable \"in any case presenting a claim for training by a State ...\ncourts must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional.\" 457 U.S. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at\n2461.\nThe district court followed Youngberg's precepts. It identified as a constitutional predicate to its decree Thomas's\nliberty interests in safety and freedom from undue restraint. In fashioning a remedy, it relied on the\nrecommendations of the state's professionals at Broughton Hospital. The district court did not err in finding that\ntreatment and training based on the recommendations were reasonable in light of Thomas's liberty interests and\nthe circumstances of the case. Tom's safety was threatened by his aggressiveness and his attempted suicide.\nThese problems were fully documented and well known to the team of professionals who evaluated him and\nprescribed corrective treatment. With respect to Thomas's interest in freedom from undue restraint, the\nprofessionals at Broughton noted: \"Maximum of invivo [sic] exposure to the community is essential (night\nhospitalization and full time day involvement in the local community could be considered as one possibility to start\nwith).\" Their recommended treatment included transfer from the hospital to a group home in the community.\nThe Secretary's assertion that Thomas has received minimally adequate treatment consistent with professional\njudgment is not supported by the record. Although the professional team at Broughton suggested that night\nhospitalization could be considered a possibility to start Thomas's treatment, the night care unit at the\ndetoxification center is designed for persons \"able to respond to short term night care for 7-14 days.\" Thomas\nwas lodged there for months. No professional has taken the position that lodging him in a night care unit operated\nin conjunction with a detoxification center is compatible with the treatment prescribed for him. Assignment to this\nlodging appears to have been based on expediency and a decision to save money.\nYoungberg points out that lack of funds is an absolute defense to an action for damages brought against a\nprofessional in his individual capacity. 457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. But the Court did not apply this precept\nto prospective injunctive relief. Instead, the Court explained that qualified professionals, to whom the courts owe\ndeference, may consider the burden on the state when they prescribe treatment. 457 U.S. at 322 and n. 29, 102\nS.Ct. at 2461 and n. 29. The Court did not allow the professionals free rein, however. A decision about treatment\nmade by a professional is presumed valid, but a court may reject it when it \"is such a substantial departure from\naccepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually\ndid not base the decision on such a judgment.\" 457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462.\nThere is no evidence that the evaluation team at Broughton who prescribed Thomas's treatment did not take\ncosts into consideration. One cannot assume that the qualified professionals drafted prohibitively expensive\nrecommendations. The presumption of validity accorded the professionals' decision about appropriate treatment\nhas not been rebutted. Consequently, in the absence of evidence that the decision is a \"substantial departure\nfrom accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards,\" the district court was required to accept the\nrecommendations of the qualified professionals at Broughton. See457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462.\nSociety for Goodwill to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984), and Phillips v. Thompson,\n715 F.2d 365 (7th Cir.1983), on which the Secretary relies, do not counsel that Thomas be denied relief. As the\nSecretary emphasizes, these cases stand for the proposition that there is no right to placement in the community.\n376 But neither of these cases involved a professional's judgment concerning the appropriate treatment for a specific \n*376 individual. In Society for Goodwill the district court's order that 400 mentally retarded patients be placed in\nthe community by 1987 was reversed. In Phillips the district court's refusal to place a class of several hundred\nmentally retarded adults in the community was affirmed. Thus, these decisions do not apply to the facts in\nThomas's case, in which a discrete recommendation for treatment was made by qualified professionals to meet\nthe needs of an individual, as contemplated by Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319 n. 25, 102 S.Ct. at 2460 n. 25.\nThe Secretary argues that North Carolina law makes local mental health authorities responsible for Thomas's\ntreatment in the community. The local authorities asserted that the state, acting through the department of human\nresources, is responsible.\n\nBy statutory definition, the Secretary's department is \"[t]he unit of State government authorized to implement,\nadminister, and monitor community-based programs in cooperation with local governmental authorities....\"\nN.C.Gen.Stat. § 122-35.36(6). This and related statutes justify the district court's ruling that the state, acting\nthrough the Secretary, was responsible and that the Secretary at her election could provide the required\ntreatment through local authorities. The district court's understanding of the relationship between the Secretary\nand local authorities is supported by Vaughn v. North Carolina Department of Human Resources, 296 N.C. 683,\n252 S.E.2d 792 (1979). Vaughn holds that within the meaning of the Tort Claims Act a county director of social\nservices and his staff act as agents of the state department of human resources with respect to the placement of\nchildren in foster homes. Accord Milner v. Trend Community Mental Health Services, Docket TA 7353\n(N.C.Indus.Comm'n Nov. 10, 1981), aff'd (N.C.Indus.Comm'n July 28, 1982) (for purposes of Tort Claims Act,\ndoctors employed by local mental health authority are agents of department of human resources).\nFinally, we reject the Secretary's claim that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment. Although\nthe evidence presented in Thomas's behalf is voluminous, the district court did not rest on it. Instead, the court\nbased summary judgment on the report and recommendation of the Secretary's professionals at Broughton\nHospital, which were introduced into evidence by the Secretary. The guardian, through his counsel, also\nacknowledged:\nWhat Tom needs is as follows:\na. A room to stay in, to meet his needs for privacy, within a supervised home with resident\nmanagers;\nb. Provision of meals at scheduled times;\nc. Developmental skills training, in self care and housekeeping as needed;\nd. Outside program resources, as needed:\ni. Vocational training\nii. Psychosocial rehabilitation\niii. Adult basic education\niv. Individual therapeutic counseling\nv. Supportive/behavioral counselling and\nvi. Case management.\nThis represents a consensus of those involved in Tom's treatment for the past 1 1/2 years. If his\nneeds are many, we point out that substituting for twenty years of no family and little or no\ntreatment is not an easy thing.\nThe remedy ordered by the court responds to these needs. There is no genuine issue of material fact about them\nor about the recommendations on which the order is based.\nIn sum, we find in the record no warrant for reversing the district court's order granting summary judgment and\nrequiring implementation of the treatment and training prescribed by qualified professionals at Broughton\nHospital.\n377  IV\n*377\nThe district court directed both the guardian and the Secretary to furnish Thomas specific treatment based on the\nrecommendation of qualified professionals. The court also directed the guardian to \"exercise his duties and\nresponsibilities to the full extent required by N.C.Gen.Stat. § 35-1.34 and in a manner not inconsistent with the\n\njudgment.\" It absolved the guardian from personal responsibility for providing funds or resources for the treatment\nthat it ordered.\nThe guardian assigns error to the district court's order on three grounds. He contends that the court lacks\njurisdiction over him on the basis of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, because he has not acted under color of state law and\nbecause his actions cannot be attributed to the state. He argues that because he is a fiduciary, not a care giver,\nhe is not subject to the requirements of Youngberg. Finally, he asserts that the eleventh amendment deprives the\ncourt of jurisdiction to instruct the guardian on the performance of his duties prescribed by state law. The\nguardian does not assign error to any of the specific provisions pertaining to the treatment ordered by the court.\nIndeed, throughout this litigation the guardian has tried to secure for Thomas the treatment recommended by the\nprofessionals.\nWe find that jurisdiction over the guardian is proper under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457\nU.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2753, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982), the Court explained that \"conduct allegedly causing\nthe deprivation of a federal right [must] be fairly attributable to the State.\" The Court then outlined a two-part test\nfor determining whether a defendant's acts may be attributed to the state. The first component of the test, the\n\"under color of state law\" requirement of § 1983, is satisfied if the deprivation is \"caused by the exercise of some\nright or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by the State or by a person for whom the\nState is responsible.\" 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. at 2753.\nIn this case the guardian's authority over Thomas is a \"right or privilege created by the State.\" By statute, \"[t]he\nessential purpose of guardianship is to replace an individual's authority to make decisions with the authority of a\nguardian when the individual does not have adequate capacity to make such decisions.\" N.C.Gen.Stat. § 35-1.6\n(3). A panoply of provisions empowers the guardian to implement this broad legislative purpose. Among the\nguardian's powers are the authority to establish his ward's domicile and to provide for his training and treatment.\nN.C.Gen.Stat. § 35-1.34(a)(1) and (a)(2). North Carolina law also authorizes the guardian to \"give any consent or\napproval that may be necessary to enable the ward to receive medical, legal, psychological, or other professional\ncare, counsel, treatment, or service.\" N.C.Gen.Stat. § 35-1.34(a)(4). Exercising his authority to make decisions\nfor Thomas, the guardian arranged that Thomas be placed at Broughton Hospital and agreed to the temporary\ncontinuation of the commitment.\nThe guardian's reliance on Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981), is\nmisplaced. In Polk County the Court held that a public defender does not act under color of state law within the\nmeaning of § 1983. Nevertheless, as the Court in Polk County pointed out, one who performs a custodial function\npursuant to state law falls within the scope of § 1983. See454 U.S. at 320, 102 S.Ct. at 450. There can be no\ndoubt that the guardian has custody of his ward, Thomas. N.C.Gen.Stat. § 35-1.34(a)(1).\nThe second component of the Lugar test of a cause of action under § 1983 inquires whether the defendant \"may\nfairly be said to be a state actor.\" 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. at 2753. In this case the guardian is properly\ncharacterized as a state actor because \"he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state\nofficials....\" 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. at 2753. Working with the state hospital and with officials from local\n378 agencies, the guardian had Thomas admitted to Broughton *378 Hospital and to succeeding placements. In \nLugar the Court recognized that \"a private party's joint participation with state officials in the seizure of disputed\nproperty is sufficient to characterize that party as a `state actor' for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" 457\nU.S. at 941, 102 S.Ct. at 2755,citing Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1605, 26\nL.Ed.2d 142 (1970). The actions of the guardian in joining with state officials to have Thomas moved from place\nto place irrespective of Thomas's will are legally indistinguishable from the seizure challenged in Lugar.\nThe guardian relies in part on Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979), as authority\nfor the proposition that a guardian appointed by the state is not a state actor for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In \nParham the Court ruled that the procedural due process required by the fourteenth amendment was the same\nwhen either a parent or a guardian sought to admit a child to a state mental hospital. The guardian contends that\nthis ruling and the reasoning underlying it establish that the guardianship is associated with the interests of the\nward and is identified with parental rather than state control.\n\nWe cannot accept the argument that Parham requires dismissal of the guardian. In the first place, the question of\nthe guardian's status as a state actor for the purpose of § 1983 was not before the Court in Parham. In the\nsecond place, the Court observed that there may be a difference in procedures required for reviewing a ward's\nneed for continuing care as compared with the procedures required to review a similar need of a child with\nnatural parents. The Court acknowledged the risk that a child without natural parents may be \"lost in the shuffle.\" \n442 U.S. at 619, 99 S.Ct. at 2512. It noted that the ward's commitment to the institution may have been\nprolonged because his guardian had difficulty finding a foster home. This situation is quite similar to the one that\nconfronts Thomas. Rather than dismissing the guardian, as Thomas's guardian asks us to do, the Parham Court\nremanded the case for consideration of the issue of whether wards of the state should be treated differently from\nchildren with natural parents with respect to their long-term placement.\nWe conclude that the guardian acted under color of state law and that he is a state actor for purposes of\njurisdiction under § 1983. Moreover, the guardian was properly joined under Rule of Civil Procedure 19. The\npowers of the guardian are so pervasive that in his absence complete relief cannot be afforded Thomas. The\nguardian is subject to service of process and his joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject\nmatter of the action.\nThe guardian argues further that \"a defendant whose responsibility to plaintiff does not derive from direct\nprovision of care cannot be brought to task under Youngberg.\" The guardian points out that he was appointed\nunder a state law requiring that a \"disinterested public agent\" serve as guardian of an incompetent when no\nprivate individual or corporation can be found who is willing to serve. N.C.Gen.Stat. § 35-1.29. By law, the\n\"disinterested public agent\" must be \"an adult officer, agent, or employee of a State human resources agency\nwho has no immediate responsibilities for providing services to a ward....\" N.C.Gen.Stat. § 35-1.7(4).\nNevertheless, the guardian's responsibilities cannot be distinguished from those of the defendants in Youngberg\non the ground that the guardian has no immediate responsibility for providing services to his ward. The\ndefendants in Youngberg were the administrators of the state hospital to which the respondent had been\ncommitted. 457 U.S. at 310 n. 3, 102 S.Ct. at 2455 n. 3. They had custody of the patient and were responsible for\nmaking decisions concerning his treatment and training. Similarly, the guardian has legal custody of Thomas and\nis responsible for making decisions concerning his treatment. We agree with the guardian, however, that \n379 Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 *379 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984),\nprecludes a federal court from directing a state official to perform the duties imposed on him by state law.\nConsequently, on remand the district court should delete from its order the direction to the guardian pertaining to\nthe exercise of his duties under state law. This modification of the decree does not relieve the guardian from all\nresponsibility with respect to the relief the district court ordered. He must, as the district court required, exercise\nhis authority over Thomas in a manner not inconsistent with the court's judgment. This obligation remains as a\nmatter of federal law. He cannot act under color of state law to infringe the liberty interests secured by the\nfourteenth amendment that are the subject of this litigation.\nThe judgment entered against the Secretary is affirmed. The judgment entered against the guardian is affirmed,\nsubject to modification consistent with this opinion. The case is remanded to the district court.\n[1]Thomas S. v. Morrow, 601 F.Supp. 1055 (W.D.N.C.1984).

HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS \nPaul Caldwell, next friend of plaintiff Thomas S., filed this suit on July 7, 1982, seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief under federal and state law. Also on July 7, 1982, Mr. \nCaldwell was appointed guardian ad litem for Thomas S. On July 10, 1984, Joyce M. \nBrooks was substituted as guardian ad litem for Thomas S. \nThomas S., a nineteen-year-old Gaston County resident when this action was filed, had \nbeen diagnosed as suffering from, inter alia, schizophrenia and borderline mental \nretardation, and was incapable of either living independently or managing his own affairs. \nGiven up for adoption at birth, Thomas spent his first eighteen years in approximately forty \ndifferent foster homes and institutions while in the custody of the Gaston County \nDepartment of Social Services (\"DSS\"). DSS shuffled Thomas through so many placements \nduring his youth because there were no appropriate community-based treatment facilities \navailable in Gaston County during this period. \nSoon after Thomas' eighteenth birthday, DSS succeeded in having Thomas declared legally \nincompetent. In February, 1982, defendant Allen Childress, regional adult mental health \nspecialist with the North Carolina Department of Human Resources, was appointed \nThomas' guardian. Because Childress considered Thomas' then-current placement, a rest \nhome for the elderly, inappropriate, Childress caused Thomas to be admitted to the \"R\" \n(mental retardation) unit at Broughton Hospital on March 15, 1982. \nFour months after Thomas was institutionalized at Broughton, his next friend brought this \nsuit against Sarah Morrow, then Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Human \nResources (\"Secretary\"); Allen Childress, in his official capacity as Thomas' guardian \n(\"guardian\"); and the directors of two local agencies, DSS and the Gaston-Lincoln area \nmental health program. The Gaston County Commissioners later were joined as additional \ndefendants. \nThe complaint alleged that the defendants had denied Thomas substantive due process \naccorded by the Fourteenth Amendment. It protested the defendants' failure to provide \nminimally adequate treatment, alleging that Thomas' hospitalization imposed a degree of \nrestraint on his liberty inconsistent with professional judgment regarding his treatment. The \ncomplaint charged that the defendants had deprived Thomas of liberty interests created by \nstate law, a procedural due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. The complaint \n\n \nalso asserted various pendent state law claims. Thomas requested an injunction ordering \nthe defendants to place him in an appropriate group home and to provide other treatment \nrecommended by professionals who had examined and worked with him. \nOn May 26, 1983, the court entered a consent judgment permitting the two local agency \ndefendants to contract with an independent nonprofit organization for foster 1182*1182 care \nand treatment from the date of Thomas' discharge from Broughton until March 1, 1984. \nBecause of the consent order, the court deferred all parties' motions for summary judgment \nand declared the case inactive until February 1, 1984. \nOn March 22, 1984, four individuals, Jeanette H., Todd C., Phillip B. and Margaret R., \nmoved to intervene as plaintiffs. The court appointed Cornelius Manly as guardian ad litem \nfor Ms. R. on May 4, 1984. Also on March 22, 1984, these individuals joined Thomas S. in a \nmotion to certify a statewide class of similarly situated individuals pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. \n23. The class is defined as: \nadults who are mentally retarded or who have been treated as mentally retarded and who \nare or will be inappropriately kept in public psychiatric institutions in North Carolina in \nconditions violative of their constitutional rights. \nAfter reactivating the case, the court found that Thomas had been shifted to at least three \nadditional placements since the consent judgment was filed. On August 15, 1984, the court \nheard arguments on all pending motions. The court ruled on the cross motions for summary \njudgment on September 18, 1984. Thomas S. v. Morrow, 601 F.Supp. 1055 \n(W.D.N.C.1984). All pendent state law claims against state officials were dismissed, in \naccordance with Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. \n900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). The claims against the local officials also were dismissed \nwithout prejudice. Relying on Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed. \n2d 28 (1982), the court granted summary judgment against the Secretary and the guardian \non Thomas' substantive due process claim without reaching the procedural due process \nclaim. \nOn December 7, 1984, the court entered a judgment requiring the Secretary and the \nguardian to develop a treatment plan and appoint a case manager for Thomas. The \njudgment directed them to furnish Thomas the treatment recommended by qualified \nprofessionals who had evaluated his needs. In accordance with the recommendations, the \norder specified that Thomas should be placed in a \"stable suitable supervised community \nresidential placement such as: (1) a non-institutionalized specialized adult foster care \nsituation ... or (2) a group home with adults of average intelligence.\" Adhering to the \nrecommendations, the court also directed that Thomas should be provided non-residential \nservices such as mental health counseling, adult basic education and vocational training, \nand \"opportunities for community interaction.\" The Secretary and the guardian appealed. \nAlso on December 7, 1984, the court permitted the intervention of the four additional \nplaintiffs and certified the class pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), to be represented by \nThomas S. and the intervenors. However, the court stayed further litigation on behalf of the \nintervening plaintiffs and class members pending the outcome of the appeals. \n\n \nThe court's judgment was unanimously affirmed with one technical modification by the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Thomas S. v. Morrow, 781 F.2d 367 (4th Cir.1986). \nThereafter, the Secretary's petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied. \nSeparate petitions for writs of certiorari by the Secretary and the guardian were similarly \ndenied by the Supreme Court. 476 U.S. 1124, 106 S.Ct. 1992, 90 L.Ed.2d 673 (1986), 479 \nU.S. 869, 107 S.Ct. 235, 93 L.Ed.2d 161 (1986). \nOnce the judgment in favor of Thomas S. was affirmed on appeal, the court vacated the \nstay, allowing litigation on behalf of the intervenors and the class to proceed. On May 28, \n1986, Phillip J. Kirk, then Secretary of the Department of Human Resources, was \nsubstituted as a party defendant. On July 30, 1986, the court heard plaintiffs' motion for \npartial summary judgment on behalf of the class. On August 19, 1986, the court denied this \nmotion without prejudice and ordered an evidentiary hearing. \nThe case was heard on March 5 and 6, 1987. Counsel for the Secretary requested and was \ngranted leave to offer additional evidence. On May 5, 1987, the court heard additional \nevidence. \n1183*1183 Plaintiffs claim that the confinement conditions imposed on class members in \nthe state's psychiatric hospitals violate their constitutionally protected liberty interests under \nthe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Division of Mental Health, \nMental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services (\"MH/MR/SAS\") operates within the \nDepartment of Human Resources. The state is divided into four regions, each of which \nserves the population in a designated area. Each region has a psychiatric hospital \n(Broughton Hospital in the Western region, John Umstead Hospital in the North Central \nregion, Dorothea Dix Hospital in the South Central region and Cherry Hospital in the \nEastern region), and a mental retardation center. The plaintiffs' claims do not involve the \nstate's mental retardation centers. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and prospective injunctive \nrelief against the Secretary in the form of constitutionally required treatment that is \nconsistent with the recommendations of qualified treating professionals. \nIn deciding this case, the court has carefully considered all of the evidence bearing on each \nissue, and notes that there have been conflicts in the testimony concerning: what \nconstitutes minimally adequate habilitation; what factors compromise class members' \nsafety; when drugs or mechanical restraints are being used excessively and numerous \nother professional matters. The court made decisions involving credibility and weight to \nresolve these conflicts. In assessing credibility, the court took into account the demeanor of \nthe witnesses, any interest or bias, and the knowledge, education and training of the \nwitnesses in the field of mental retardation. In addition to credibility decisions, the court \nrelied heavily on the reports and recommendations of the Secretary's professionals to \ndefine \"accepted professional judgment, practice and standards\" for application to the facts \nof this case. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. The court did not attempt to \ndetermine which of several professionally acceptable choices should have been made. \nInstead, in reviewing the voluminous evidence to determine if the Secretary is providing \nminimally adequate training, the court deferred to the reasonable judgments of qualified \nprofessionals. \nII. FINDINGS OF FACT \n\n \nA. Plaintiff-Intervenors \n1. Jeanette H. \nIntervenor Jeanette H. was admitted to Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh in 1981. She was \noriginally diagnosed as suffering from chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia, but this \ndiagnosis was later dropped. She is diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded. Early in her \nadmission, it was recognized by the state's treating professionals that she needed a \nsupervised living situation in the community. Pl.Ex. 31 at 2. Nonetheless, she was kept at \nDix and continuously medicated. She had behavior problems that did not improve with the \nmedication. While at Dix, she suffered a severe case of lithium toxicity. Since becoming an \nintervenor in this case, she was enrolled in a sheltered workshop, her medication was \nreduced, and in January of 1987 she was discharged from Dix to a family care home in the \ncommunity. Pl.Ex. 31. \n2. Todd C. \nTodd C. is a resident of Dix Hospital. He was diagnosed as having an intellectual function \non the borderline between average intelligence and mild mental retardation. He was also \ndiagnosed as suffering from an atypical psychosis by history, histrionic personality disorder, \nseizure disorder, and hydrocephaly. He lives on a \"management stepdown\" ward which \nhouses mentally ill patients at a maintenance stage of treatment. When Mr. C. was admitted \nto Dix in 1981, the state's professionals noted that \"a psychiatric admission ward is not \nadequate treatment for this patient.\" Over the next five years, less restrictive, community-\nbased placements were repeatedly recommended for Mr. C. by the Secretary's \nprofessionals. Despite these recommendations, Mr. C. remains at Dix Hospital. He has \nfrequently been secluded and mechanically restrained. Pl.Ex. 30. \n1184*1184 3. Phillip B. \nPhillip B. was admitted to Dix Hospital in March of 1983. He has been diagnosed as \nfunctioning intellectually in the moderate to severe mental retardation range. He has not \nbeen diagnosed as suffering from any mental illness. He was hospitalized at Dix after \"a few \nviolent outbursts\" at a group home. His treatment professionals recommended community \nplacement, but he had to wait for several months at Dix during which time his behavior \nregressed. Pl.Ex. 32 at 4. At his commitment hearing in January of 1984, the attorney \nrepresenting Mr. B. admitted to the court that he would be kept at Dix even if he did not \nmeet commitment criteria. Pl.Ex. 27 at 4. After Mr. B. was permitted to intervene in this \ncase, he was discharged from Dix Hospital. He is now living successfully in the community. \nPl.Ex. 32. \n4. Margaret R. \nMargaret R. was first admitted to Broughton Hospital in 1973. She has been diagnosed as \nsuffering from organic brain syndrome and an organic personality disorder. She appears to \n\n \nfunction in the range of mild mental retardation. After intervening in this case, Ms. R. was \nplaced in a rest home for the aged. The rest home where Ms. R. was placed is the same \none used for Thomas S. and found by this court to be inconsistent with the professional \njudgment of those who examined and treated Thomas S. 601 F.Supp. at 1058-59. This \nhome does not offer necessary services for mentally retarded people. This placement was \nthe Secretary's attempt to implement the longstanding recommendation of the state's \ntreating professionals that Ms. R. be placed in a less restrictive, community-based \nresidence (such as a group home for the mentally retarded). After the rest home refused to \ncontinue to care for Ms. R., she was returned to Broughton Hospital. Ms. R. has no \ndiagnosis of mental illness, yet she continues to live on a general psychiatric ward. Ms. R. \nappeared and testified in the evidentiary hearing in this case. She expressed her desire to \nlive in the community, but there is no appropriate program for her. Tr. 232, 505, 527. \nB. Plaintiff Class \n1. Description of the Class and General Findings \nThere are approximately four hundred mentally retarded class members in the state's four \npsychiatric hospitals. The estimated number of class members has ranged from 393 to 470. \nApproximately half or more of those persons have no diagnosis of mental illness. Pl.Ex. 42 \nat 8. For example, on February 27, 1986, forty-seven percent of the class members \nconfined at the state psychiatric hospitals had a diagnosis of mental retardation only. Pl.Ex. \n10. \nMental retardation involves difficulty and slowness in learning and delayed development of \nintellectual functioning. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 309 n. 1, 102 S.Ct. at 2454 n. 1; Glenn Dep. \nat 22-23. Mental illness, on the other hand, involves a disturbance of emotions or thinking, \nfrom whatever cause, which interferes with a person's ability to handle life situations. Glenn \nDep. at 23; Tr. 23. The psychiatric facilities use a medical model which starts with the \nconcept that a person has a sickness and that sickness is treated. The mental \nretardation/developmental disability model provides an opportunity for development. It \nprovides training and education called \"habilitation.\" Tr. 556-57; Pl.Ex. 46 at 3. Habilitation \nis defined as follows: \n\"The process by which the staff of an agency assists an individual to acquire and maintain \nthose life skills that enable the individual to cope more effectively with the demands of his or \nher own person and environmental and social functioning. Habilitation includes, but is not \nlimited to, programs of formal structured education and treatment.\" \nAssociation For Retarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson, 561 F.Supp. 473, 488 n. 20 \n(D.N.D.1982) (quoting Accredition Council for Services for Mentally Retarded and Other \nDevelopmentally Disabled Persons, \"Standards for Services for Developmentally Disabled \nPersons\" (1981 edition)). \nOf approximately 470 adults with mental retardation in the hospitals, 404 were identified \n1185*1185 as being confined in general psychiatric wards of the hospitals. Pl.Ex. 3 at 1-2. \nOnly one of the hospitals (Broughton) has a unit designated for mentally retarded people \n\n \nand that unit houses some but not all of the class members at Broughton. There is a \nprofessional consensus that mentally retarded people who are continuously exposed to \nmentally ill patients begin to \"model\" the dysfunctional behaviors of the mentally ill patients \nwith whom they are confined. Pl.Ex. 43 at 45-54; Pl.Ex. 46 at 15; Glenn Dep. at 32-33. \nThere is also professional consensus that developmental, behavior-based treatment called \n\"habilitation\" is the appropriate milieu for people with mental retardation. \nMore than half of the class members have been identified as being \"voluntarily\" committed \nto the psychiatric institutions pursuant to N.C.Gen.Stat. § 122C-211 (1986). Most of these \nclass members have no guardian and have signed themselves into the institution. Pl.Ex. 19. \nA number of the \"voluntarily\" institutionalized plaintiffs who do not have guardians are \nseverely mentally retarded and lack the capacity to understand the legal step they have \ntaken. Pl.Ex. 18 at 2. \nMany of the class members who were originally identified by the Secretary on discovery as \nhaving a diagnosis of mental retardation were later reclassified by the Secretary as having a \nbehavior disorder. A behavior disorder is a problem some mentally retarded people have in \nconducting themselves, which is characterized by self-injury, aggressiveness, or rage \nreactions. It is not considered a mental illness. Tr. 23, 204. It is considered a \"grab-bag\" \nterm which is sometimes used to label clients who are a management problem. Tr. 415. \nThere are striking similarities between the conditions which led to the relief granted original \nplaintiff Thomas S. and the conditions in which the intervenors and plaintiff class members \nare forced to live. For example, at Broughton Hospital alone there are at least thirty-five \nclass members for whom group home or family care placement in the community has been \nrecommended by the Secretary's treating professionals. Despite these recommendations, \nmany of these plaintiffs remain confined in state psychiatric hospitals. The record is replete \nwith other examples of placement and treatment recommendations being ignored or their \nimplementation being unjustifiably delayed. Numerous other constitutional violations have \nbeen established, including the following, which are discussed in detail below: \n(a) Many of the plaintiffs have no diagnosis of mental illness, yet they are placed in facilities \nfor the mentally ill. \n(b) Some of the plaintiffs have been inappropriately placed in rest homes for the elderly. \n(c) Many of the plaintiffs have behavioral problems which make them difficult patients to \ntreat. This difficulty is frequently used by the state to justify inappropriate placements. \n(d) Many of the plaintiffs have been recommended for appropriate placement and treatment \nin less restrictive residential settings, including group homes or specialized foster care. \nThese recommendations, made by state employees (including doctors, social workers, \npsychologists, and occupational therapists) were often incorporated in treatment plans. The \nplacement recommendations and the treatment plans are frequently ignored, and the \nplaintiffs remain confined year after year in state psychiatric institutions. \n(e) At times the people responsible for consenting to or approving commitment of a class \nmember to a state psychiatric hospital do so because there is literally no other place for the \nclass member to go. \n\n \n(f) For many of the plaintiffs, there are no established alternatives to placement in a state \npsychiatric hospital. The state has chosen not to make appropriate alternatives available. \nFor other plaintiffs, established alternatives (such as state facilities designed to treat mental \nretardation) are unavailable. \n(g) Many of the plaintiffs are wards of the state. Further, the state has control 1186*1186 \nover the liberty and care of each class member while he or she is committed to a state \npsychiatric institution. Some class members have been kept in a state psychiatric hospital \nlong after the original commitment order required their release. \n2. Aggression, Self-Abuse and Other Physical Injury \nClass members have been physically injured as a result of the conditions at the four state \npsychiatric institutions. Approximately fifteen percent of the institutionalized class members \nengage in self-injurious behavior. Pl.Ex. 13 at 2. Other class members engage in assaultive \nbehavior. Pl.Ex. 10. When appropriate services are offered, self-injurious and aggressive \nbehaviors are significantly reduced or totally extinguished. Tr. 49-50. \nAggression or assaultive behavior in mentally retarded people can be caused by crowding, \nnoise levels, frustration, or lack of appropriate training. The state's mental retardation \ndeputy explained, for example, that if a mentally retarded person is told to \"make your bed\" \nand that person does not know how to make the bed and does not know how to tell the \nperson giving the command, \"I don't know how to do that,\" he or she can get very frustrated \nand may attack the person who gave the command. Mentally retarded people are often \nexcluded from the opportunity to learn because of assaultive behavior of this type that \nresults from their frustration. Pl.Ex. 44 at 8-9, 15. \n\"Habilitation\" is a term used to refer to the process of helping a person with mental \nretardation acquire needed skills. The principal focus of habilitation is on learning and \ntraining, because mental retardation is a learning disability and a training impairment, rather \nthan an illness. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 309 n. 1, 102 S.Ct. at 2454 n. 1; Pl.Ex. 46 at 3; \nPl.Ex. 44 at 12. \nThe Secretary offers few, if any, habilitation or behavior programs for mentally retarded \nadults confined in the state psychiatric hospitals. When behavioral modification treatment is \noffered, the evidence suggests that the treatment is not adequately individualized, \nmonitored, or re-evaluated to comport with minimal professional standards for treatment of \nmentally retarded persons. \nDue to inadequate behavioral programming, class members are sometimes injured at their \nown hands. Pl.Ex. 42 at 4. For example, Guy W., class member at Broughton Hospital, has \nbeen institutionalized since 1936 when he was sixteen years old. He began to self-induce \nvomiting in 1979. His treatment plan shows that his primary habilitation need in order to be \ndischarged from the institution is to improve his behavior. Yet, no training has been \nprovided to help him learn to stop this behavior. \nDanny W. is a member of the class. He is blind, mentally retarded, and confined to a ward \nat Broughton Hospital. He engages in self-abusive behavior. He bites his hand, and he has \n\n \nbegun to eat feces. He sits in a wheelchair on a very handicapped ward with very little to do. \nHe has not been given any sort of habilitation. Tr. 52. \nA behavior plan was proposed for intervenor Todd C. to stop him from self-abusive \nbehavior, but it was not used for several years. The Secretary made no attempt to justify \nthis failure to follow the professional recommendation. \nOn some wards, there are not enough staff members to assure safety of the residents. \nGlenn Dep. at 35-36, 63; Pl.Ex. 41 at 16. \nSome class members have been injured by the lack of adaptive equipment or the improper \nuse thereof. Glenn Dep. at 106-08; P.Ex. 41 at 4. Mary W. has been severely injured. Pl.Ex. \n42 at 10; Tr. 39-50, 93. \n3. Drugs \nClass members have been seriously endangered and injured by the inappropriate use of \nantipsychotic drugs. This group of drugs belongs to a class of psychotropic medications \nused to treat certain psychiatric disorders. The terms \"antipsychotic,\" \"neuroleptic,\" and \n\"psychotropic\" have 1187*1187 been used interchangeably throughout the evidence, but \nhave different meanings. Antipsychotic drugs are drugs used to treat psychotic disorders \nwhere people are not in touch with reality. Tr. 148. Antipsychotic drugs include Thorazine, \nMellaril, Haldol, Loxitane, Prolixin, and a number of others. Tr. 298. They are not useful in \ntreating or relieving the effects of mental retardation. Pl.Ex. 50. \nOf class members institutionalized at three of the four state psychiatric hospitals, seventy-\nthree percent were being given antipsychotic drugs, yet forty-three percent of that group has \nno diagnosis of mental illness. Tr. 230. \ni. Adverse Effects. \nAntipsychotic drugs are dangerous and can cause a number of severe adverse effects, \nincluding tardive dyskinesia, an irreversible neurological disease where a person has \ninvoluntary movements of the face, arms and legs. Tr. 149-50, 376. Tardive dyskinesia \noccurs in people without regard to their mental condition, Tr. 370, and about thirty percent of \npeople who receive prolonged antipsychotic drugs develop tardive dyskinesia. Tr. 208. \nProfessional standards and the Secretary's policies require periodic monitoring of drug \nadverse effects. Pl.Ex. 52 at 28; Def.Ex. 8; Tr. 339-40. This has not been done for most \nclass members. Pl.Ex. 42 at 2, # 5; Pl.Ex. 42 at 4, # 1(b); Tr. 225, 342-43. The evidence \nshows that the Secretary's agents' use of antipsychotic drugs on the class members in their \ncustody has resulted in tardive dyskinesia for a number of class members. Pl.Ex. 42 at 2, ## \n3-4; Pl.Ex. 42 at 4, # 2; Pl.Ex. 22 at 2; Tr. 330, 338. \nPlaintiffs' pharmocological expert, Dr. Henry Crabbe, personally examined thirty-three class \nmembers who were being given antipsychotic drugs at three of the state psychiatric \ninstitutions. Based on the brief personal examination alone, Dr. Crabbe observed that of \n\n \nthose examined at Cherry Hospital, eighty-eight percent manifested symptoms of adverse \neffects; forty percent showed such symptoms at Broughton Hospital; and thirty-three \npercent showed such symptoms at Dix Hospital. Tr. 151, 223-24. \nii. Standards for Avoiding, Minimizing and Treating \nAdverse Effects. \nBecause of these serious adverse effects from antipsychotic drugs, minimal professional \nstandards as well as the Secretary's written policies require that patients, their families, \nand/or their legal guardians be informed about the risks, side effects and benefits of \npsychotropic medications. Pl.Ex. 52 at 28; Tr. 339-40; Def.Ex. 56. \nThe Secretary introduced a number of policies from the Standards of Clinical Practice \nManual and the Nursing Policy Manual at Dorothea Dix Hospital and some policies that \napply statewide. The standards on medical education provide that patients or their legal \nguardians shall be informed about the risks, side effects and benefits of specific \nmedications including psychotropics, and that evidence of this instruction as well as the \npatient's response to it be documented in the patient's medical record. \nThe Secretary and his agents have failed to follow these policies for many class members. \nNone of the records of class members presented to the court reflect that these policies were \never applied to them. Pl.Exs. 30, 31, 32, 42; Def.Exs. 14, 15, 36. Class member Thelma B., \nwho is severely retarded, is purported to have signed an \"X\" to \"informed\" consent for \nmedication. Pl.Ex. 42 at 4, ## 11-12; Pl.Ex. 39. Professional standards also require a \nperiodic review of the antipsychotic drug prescriptions to see if they are needed. Pl.Ex. 52 at \n5; Tr. 339-40; Pl.Ex. 43 at 16. Yet this has not been done for some class members. Pl.Ex. \n43 at 31. \nMedical standards require continuing efforts to reduce the amount of neuroleptic drugs a \nperson receives. Tr. 337; Pl.Ex. 52 at 5; Tr. 339-40. This was not done for a number of \nclass members. Pl.Ex. 41 at 16; Tr. 175-76, 337-38. \nIn a study based on the medical records of thirty-nine patients (out of a population \n1188*1188 of 675) at Dix Hospital, it was determined that in twenty-one percent of the \ncases, medication was not reduced even where tardive dyskinesia was diagnosed. Tr. 378. \nThis violates state and national standards. Pl.Ex. 52 at 28. \nMedical record keeping is substandard and dangerously inadequate. Tr. 172, 225, 334-35. \niii. Behavior Control. \nOne of the ways the Secretary has most endangered plaintiffs is by the long-term use of \nantipsychotic drugs for the purported purpose of controlling behavior disorders. Evidence \nwas introduced that the American Psychiatric Association published a Tardive Dyskinesia \nTask Force Report in 1979 finding that the efficacy and safety of the long-term or \n\"maintenance\" use of antipsychotic drugs for mentally retarded people with behavior \n\n \ndisorders had not been adequately demonstrated. Pl.Ex. 50. Medical standards proscribe \nthe long-term (or \"maintenance\") administration of antipsychotic drugs to mentally retarded \npeople with no mental illness, even if they have a behavior problem. Pl.Ex. 42 at 1-2, ## 1-\n2; Pl.Ex. 42 at 5, # 3; Tr. 151, 169-71, 339-40; Pl.Ex. 52 at 28. \nEven on a short-term basis, it is not acceptable to rely on drugs to the exclusion of other \nmethods to treat people with behavior problems. Yet the Secretary has used drugs in this \nway on many class members. Glenn Dep. at 38-39, 46, 49, 62; Pl.Ex. 41, at 9, 16, 17; Tr. \n50-51, 152, 164-66, 174, 417; Pl.Ex. 43 at 18. \nFor example, Mary W. has been on antipsychotic drugs even though in 1953 she was not \npsychotic but, rather, \"a mentally deficient person for whom the hospital has nothing to \noffer.\" The drugs are purportedly used for her behavior problem. This has continued since \nthe 1950's without any documented behavior training, even though her condition worsened \nand the records show that medication was not effective. Pl.Ex. 42 at 4, # 1; Tr. 50-51. \nOther class members have also been sedated by the long-term use of antipsychotic drugs \nin lieu of behavioral program and without any regard to the safety or usefulness of the drugs \nfor the class members. Pl.Ex. 42 at 5, ## 3-4. \niv. Chemical Restraint. \n\"PRN\" medications are medications given pursuant to a physician's standing order which \nallows lower level hospital staff to use their own discretion to decide when to administer a \ndrug. When it involves antipsychotic and related medications, it is a form of chemical \nrestraint. In long-term residential units, its use can result in overmedication in lieu of \nalternative behavior programming. Twenty-four percent of class members at Broughton \nHospital were subjected to chemical restraint during a recent one-month period; at Dix \nHospital, the figure was sixty-one percent; at Cherry Hospital, the figure was seventy \npercent. Tr. 173-175. Many states have rules for facilities for the mentally retarded which \nprohibit this practice of giving antipsychotic drugs \"PRN.\" Tr. 174. \nData on the frequency of use of \"PRN Med Restraint\" during one month show that, at least \nin some cases, there is no correlation between the use of such restraints and incidents of \naggression toward self and others. One class member received \"PRN meds\" twenty-three \ntimes in a month, with only four reported incidents of \"aggression.\" Another class member \nwas given \"PRN meds\" twenty-one times, but only three incidents of aggression were \nreported. Pl.Ex. 10 at 25-28. The court does not find that the use of chemical restraint in \nemergency situations is a substantial departure from professional judgment. However, \nthese illustrations tend to show that when chemical restraints are authorized \"PRN,\" they \nare overused and represent a substantial departure from the professional judgment of a \nqualified treating professional. \nv. Excessive Dosages. \nThe Secretary administers excessive dosages of drugs to class members. Pl.Ex. 43 at 31. \nThis unnecessarily subjects them to risks of overmedication. There is a professional \n\n \nconsensus that the usual maintenance 1189*1189 or long-term dose for antipsychotic \nmedication translates into the equivalent of 200-300 milligrams of Thorazine. Most of the \ninstitutionalized class members are on a long-term regimen of antipsychotic drugs. The \naverage Thorazine equivalent dosage among the state hospitals varies markedly but is \nalways far above the professionally accepted usual maintenance dose. Among the class \nmembers sampled, the average daily Thorazine equivalent was 592 milligrams at Dix \nHospital, 746 milligrams at Broughton Hospital, and 1,114 milligrams at Cherry Hospital. \nWhere doses are higher, there is a higher likelihood of adverse effects. \nThe Secretary made no effort to explain these variations or excessive dosages. Tr. 179-82. \nThe standard used at Cherry Hospital for the daily dosage range of antipsychotic drugs is \nso broad that it is acceptable under that standard for a large dose to be forty times greater \nthan a low dose, and the decision is a pure judgment call by the doctor. Tr. 551; Def.Ex. 45 \nat 4. There are instances where class members are given dosages which exceed even the \ninstitution's own guidelines, with no justification given. To exceed established drug dosage \nmaximum limits without showing a justification is a substantial departure from professional \nstandards. Tr. 176-77. \nThe Secretary administered the psychotropic drug Lithium to named intervening plaintiff \nJeanette H. so that the level of Lithium in her blood reached 6.58 — an alarming level. \nPlaintiff's psychopharmocological expert had never seen a patient have a blood Lithium \nlevel of more than 3.9 and still live. Tr. 166-68. In fact, Jeanette H. went into a coma and \nwas transferred to the critical care unit for Lithium toxicity. During the time she was being \ngiven Lithium, the Secretary was also giving her Thorazine. Pl.Ex. 31 at 3, 9-13. \nvi. the Polypharmacy. \nThe Secretary admits that some types of polypharmacy, such as administering more than \none antipsychotic drug to a person at one time, are not generally accepted medical practice. \nTr. 423. Nevertheless, this is done to some class members. Intervenor Jeanette H. was kept \non a number of antipsychotic drugs together including Thorazine and Prolixin. Tr. 398. \nClass member Freddie S. continued to receive three different psychotropic medications, \ndespite the fact that his assessment shows he benefits little from the medication. Pl.Ex. 38. \nNo explanation was offered by the Secretary for these departures from professional \nstandards. \nThe manner in which the Secretary has administered antipsychotic drugs to class members, \nin violation of the standards discussed above, is a substantial departure from the exercise of \nprofessional judgment. Tr. 182. \n4. Seclusion and Mechanical Restraint \nMechanical restraint is the practice of tying or strapping someone to a bed or a chair. \nSeclusion is the practice of confining a patient alone in a bare room. Glenn Dep. at 38; \nDef.Ex. 11. \n\n \nIt is a substantial departure from professional standards to rely routinely on seclusion and \nrestraint rather than systematic behavior techniques such as social reinforcement to control \naggressive behavior. Seclusion and restraint should only be used as a last resort. Glenn \nDep. at 38; Pl.Ex. 42 at 6-7; Pl.Ex. 43 at 44; Pl.Ex. 45 at 24-26. \nIn the state psychiatric institutions, however, seclusion and restraint are used often on \nplaintiffs. About seventeen percent of the class members were secluded or restrained \nduring a reported one-month period, including eleven plaintiffs who were restrained fifty-\nthree times even though they had no documented evidence of aggression towards \nthemselves or others. Pl.Ex. 10; Pl.Ex. 42 at 5; Tr. 53. Class members are more likely to be \nsubject to mechanical restraint in defendant's psychiatric institutions than when they are \nelsewhere. Pl.Ex. 44 at 6. Some class members have been mechanically restrained when \nthey were noisy or annoying to other patients. \nFor example, class member Magdeline S. has been secluded and restrained for hollering \n1190*1190 and she has sometimes not been released when she quieted down. Pl.Ex. 42 at \n5-6, #4. The Secretary repeatedly restrained class member Geraldine G. of Broughton \nHospital for being noisy and annoying other patients. Tr. 63. Class member Mary W. at \nBroughton Hospital engaged in self-injurious behavior in the form of hitting herself in the \nhead. She has been in soft body restraints or a geriatric chair (a type of restraint) for almost \nall of the time since the late 1940's. The restraint started out at nine hours a day most days \n(in the mid to late 1940's), then increased to nineteen hours, then to twenty-four hours a \nday. For decades and continuing to the present, she has been restrained for all of her \nwaking hours. The records do not reveal that behavior training was ever considered or tried \nto help her stop trying to hit herself. In 1975 a doctor recommended fitting her with boxing \ngloves so she would not injure herself with her hands. However, gloves were never even \ntried because she had no money in her account. Pl.Ex. 33. The use of restraint on Mary W. \nin this manner is a substantial departure from professional judgment which the Secretary \nhas not attempted to explain. Pl.Ex. 42 at 6, # 5; Tr. 39, 42, 47, 48, 50, 51. \nFormerly a member of the Willie M class, class member Fred S. is now twenty-one years \nold and is in Dix Hospital. Since there is no adequate behavioral training to stop his \nassaultive behavior, the staff continues to seclude and mechanically restrain him when he \nacts aggressively. He was secluded and restrained almost sixty percent of the days he has \nbeen at Dix. The average time in seclusion on those days has been 2.9 hours. For almost \nall of the time he was secluded, he was restrained (usually four-point restraint — spread-\neagled). During one two-week period, Fred S. was secluded for eleven of fourteen days with \nan average seclusion period for each of 6.4 hours. The Secretary has failed to explain this \nexcessive use of seclusion and mechanical restraint and has failed to provide class \nmembers with adequate training to overcome the behavior problems that trigger it. See \nSection II.B.7, infra. \n5. Unnecessary Confinement \nMany of the plaintiffs have been unnecessarily confined in locked wards of psychiatric \nhospitals for lengthy periods of time, despite a professional consensus that they need not \nbe locked up in that way even if they have some mental illness or behavior problems and \nnotwithstanding the recommendations of individual treatment professionals that they be \n\n \nplaced in less restrictive environments in the community. Pl.Ex. 44 at 2-3; Pl.Ex. 43 at 2, 24-\n25, 36; Pl.Ex. 46 at 29. \ni. Locked Wards. \nIn the four state psychiatric hospitals where mentally retarded persons are housed, almost \nall of the wards are locked, at least for part of the day, and movement within the wards is \ncontained by staff. Pl.Ex. 41 at 4; Tr. 26, 107. Many class members on locked wards could \nlive in a more open setting if such were available. Glenn Dep. at 32, 110-11. \nii. Institutional Confinement. \nThe evidence established that psychiatric stabilization normally takes approximately twenty-\none days and that behavior stabilization normally takes thirty to one hundred and twenty \ndays. Pl.Ex. 45 at 21; Pl.Ex. 6. Class members, however, stay an average of ten years in \nthe state psychiatric institutions. Pl.Ex. 42 at 7, # 1(b); Tr. 70. At Cherry Hospital, the \naverage class member has been confined for twenty-five years. Tr. 70; Pl.Ex. 14. At Dix \nHospital, almost half of the class members have been confined for over fifteen years. Pl.Ex. \n42 at 7, # 2. No attempt was made by the Secretary to justify such lengthy hospitalizations \nor to explain regional differences. The Secretary's agents admit that many class members \nhave been hospitalized much longer than is appropriate for them and that many others \nshould not be there at all. Pl.Ex. 46 at 29. Like the original named plaintiff, Thomas S., \nmany mentally retarded persons who are now at the state psychiatric institutions do not \nneed to be institutionalized even if they also have mental 1191*1191 illness or behavior \ndisorder. Pl.Ex. 44 at 2-3; Def.Ex. 16 at 92; Glenn Dep. at 128-29. \nThe North Carolina Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985 \nauthorizes involuntary commitment of persons who are mentally ill and dangerous to \nthemselves or others, or who are mentally retarded and have a behavior disorder and are \ndangerous to themselves or others. N.C.Gen.Stat. § 122C-261 (1986). However, the \nSecretary has involuntarily confined persons who do not in fact meet this standard. Tr. 239, \n255. \nAs in the case of Thomas S. himself, such institutional confinement results from an absence \nof appropriate alternatives and is not based on professional judgment. Tr. 115-17; Pl.Ex. 44 \nat 4. \nThere are 238 class members incarcerated in the psychiatric institutions on what is termed \na \"voluntary\" status, but the facts indicate that their confinement is not truly voluntary. Some \nhave been \"volunteered\" into the institution by a guardian, just as was Thomas S., including \nsome who have no mental illness. Tr. 256. Others do not have a guardian, but have signed \nthemselves into the institution. Many of these have mental retardation to such a degree that \nthey cannot exercise informed consent to make such an important legal decision. Pl.Ex. 42 \nat 8, ## 7-11; Tr. 25, Pl.Ex. 39. They have purportedly signed themselves in even though \nthey did not know what they were signing. Tr. 241; Pl.Ex. 39. \n\n \nSome class members are involuntarily committed following a court hearing because they \nhave no place else to go. Class members' appointed counsel have stipulated that their \nclients meet the commitment standard even when they do not, because the attorney knows \nthat a discharge from the hospital would result in the person being dumped into the streets \nwith no place to go. Tr. 251-52. Judges have committed class members while \nacknowledging that the decision is made for humanitarian reasons even though the legal \nstandard has not been met. That is what happened in the case of class member Phillip B. \nId.; Pl.Ex. 27. \nIn a few cases, again because there was no place else to go, class members have been \nheld at the hospital, in some cases for years, following a court decision that they be \ndischarged. Pl.Ex. 42 at 7-8, ## 4-6. \nClass member Jacob B. has been kept at Cherry Hospital since 1960, even though the \nSecretary's professionals think that he should have been released into the community many \nyears ago and probably should never have been in the institution in the first place. Pl.Ex. 43 \nat 21. \nWhen intervenor Jeanette H. entered Dorothea Dix Hospital in 1981, it was recognized by \nher treating professionals that she needed a supervised living situation in the community. \nSuch a setting was not available. In June of 1983, Jeanette's treatment team continued to \nrecommend placement in a group home with a sheltered workshop program for Jeanette. \nJeanette's treatment plan of December 20, 1983, recognized that she \"possesses all the \nnecessary skills for semi-independent living outside the institution.\" Jeanette continued to \nbe confined in the institution for three more years, despite this recommendation by her \ntreating professional. Pl.Ex. 31 at 2, 6-7. \nAt Broughton Hospital, there are at least eleven class members on Ward 36, twelve on \nWard 37, five on Ward 10, and seven on Ward 11 for whom group home or family care \nplacement in the community has been recommended but not implemented. Pl.Ex. 21. \nWith regard to named plaintiff Todd C., it was recommended by mental retardation \nprofessionals that community residential facilities that are less restrictive than Dorothea Dix \nHospital, and which offer vocational opportunities and appropriate structure including \nbehavior management, strategies, and instructional strategies be tried. Pl.Ex. 29 at 2. Again \nin January of 1986, Todd C.'s treating physician recommended that he be placed in a less \nrestrictive setting within twelve months. He was finally placed in a community based \nresidential program on December 4, 1987, almost two years later. \n1192*1192 6. Association/Access to Community \nThirty-three percent of institutionalized class members have little or no social interaction. \nPl.Ex. 42 at 7, # la. \nMany are desperate for the attention and affection which they are not getting in the \ninstitution. Tr. 89. \n\n \nAccording to the Secretary's expert Smull, mentally retarded persons have a higher sense \nof self-worth and self-esteem when they feel that they are part of the community. A person's \nself-esteem is essential for habilitation. Adequate involvement in community activities for \nmentally retarded persons consists of being as involved as that individual is capable of \nbeing at the time. Pl.Ex. 45 at 11-12, 17. \nMost class members in the state psychiatric institutions have inadequate access to \ncommunity activities. Pl.Ex. 41 at 17-18; Pl.Ex. 45 at 33. The court's findings concerning \nunnecessary confinement are also relevant to the issue of access to the community. \nClass members are forced to associate almost exclusively with other institutionalized \nmentally disabled people along with staff members on revolving shifts. Pl.Ex. 41 at 17-18. In \nmany cases, this forced association is unnecessary and does not reflect the exercise of \nprofessional judgment; instead, it is a function of the location, design, and size of the \nfacilities. Id. State psychiatric institutions are like ghettos for persons with mental handicaps. \nThe lack of access to the outside world gives the feeling of being in prison. Pl.Ex. 46 at 16. \nClass member Calvin A. at John Umstead Hospital likes to run away, go uptown to a \nrestaurant and get himself a sandwich and a cup of coffee. His treatment plan was designed \nto discourage and prevent this access to socializing in the community. Def.Ex. 16 at 177. \n7. Habilitation \nFor class members, \"minimally adequate training\" within the meaning of Youngberg \nrequires the Secretary to offer reasonable habilitation services. 457 U.S. at 317, 102 S.Ct. \nat 2458. The Secretary's experts concur with those of plaintiffs that minimum professional \nstandards require developmentally oriented \"habilitation\" for persons with mental \nretardation. Pl.Ex. 44 at 12, 22; Pl.Ex. 41 at 19; Tr. 31, 145; Glenn Dep. at 27. \n\"Habilitation\" is the process of helping a person with mental retardation to acquire needed \nself-care skills. The term refers specifically to the needs of mentally retarded individuals. Tr. \n30, 89-90, 294-95; Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 309 n. 1, 102 S.Ct. at 2454 n. 1. Developmental \nhabilitation leads persons through stages of human development to increase their capacity \nfor living more independently. Glenn Dep. at 26. All class members, including those who \nalso have mental illness, are entitled to developmental habilitation. Pl.Ex. 41 at 4-5, 18. \ni. Individual Evaluations and Treatment. \nThe first condition of providing appropriate habilitation is a good interdisciplinary evaluation. \nThe Secretary's professionals and plaintiffs' experts agree that adequate assessment of the \nindividual needs of each class member is an essential prerequisite. Pl.Ex. 15; Glenn Dep. at \n20, 54-55, 64; Tr. 34, 146, 325; Pl.Ex. 43 at 33-34; Pl.Ex. 44 at 11. \nFor the great majority of class members, however, there is no interdisciplinary assessment, \nand those that do occur are inadequate. Pl.Ex. 45 at 38; Glenn Dep. at 37, 46, 49, 53-55, \n60; Pl.Ex. 41 at 5, 13, 16. The Secretary has failed to treat each class member as an \nindividual with unique needs. Instead, class members are placed in existing programs that \n\n \nare the same for everyone, regardless of need. This is a substantial departure from \nminimally acceptable professional standards for treatment of mentally retarded persons. \nPl.Ex. 15; Tr. 32, 145, 325; Glenn Dep. at 14, 20, 32, 65; Pl.Ex. 41 at 4, 13, 16-17. \nii. Trained Staff. \nProperly trained staff are also a prerequisite to providing developmental habilitation. \n1193*1193 Tr. 38; Pl.Ex. 44 at 16-17; Pl.Ex. 27; Pl.Ex. 45 at 38-39. In the state psychiatric \nhospitals, trained staff are not available for class members, particularly on general \npsychiatric units, where the vast majority of class members reside. Glenn Dep. at 35-36; \nPl.Ex. 45 at 38-39; Tr. 38. \nOne reason for the Secretary's failure to provide properly trained staff is the medical rather \nthan developmental orientation of the state mental hospitals. Glenn Dep. at 26-27; Pl.Ex. 41 \nat 11. In the words of the assistant clinical director at Cherry Hospital, \"[w]e are not in the \nbusiness of treating with the adult developmental model.\" Tr. 556. \nSince mental retardation is not a medical problem, medical training by itself does not qualify \na person to work as a mental retardation professional. Tr. 138, 407-08. Many of the staff in \nstate psychiatric hospitals who are deciding the fate of class members are not trained to be \nmental retardation professionals. Pl.Ex. 45 at 38-39. \niii. Inhumane Living Conditions. \nHumane living conditions are a prerequisite for habilitation. Pl.Ex. 41 at 4. Many class \nmembers are subjected to inhumane living conditions in state psychiatric institutions, \nincluding: overcrowding; total lack of personal space and privacy; inadequate furnishings \nand clothing; aesthetically barren physical surroundings; and endless days of boredom \nwithout variation. Pl.Ex. 43 at 4, 35; Pl.Ex. 41 at 4, 14-16; Pl.Ex. 45 at 33; Tr. 25-27. \nKeeping mentally retarded people in such living conditions represents a substantial \ndeparture from minimally acceptable professional standards. Glenn Dep. at 31-32; Pl.Ex. 41 \nat 4. \niv. Abnormal Environment. \nProfessionals unanimously agree that mentally retarded persons need to be treated in as \nnormal a setting as possible. Tr. 66, 145; Pl.Ex. 44 at 22; Pl.Ex. 45 at 34. Access to ordinary \nactivities is essential for learning. Mentally retarded adults learn and grow through \nobserving and participating in the commonplace events of daily life. Glenn Dep. at 32, 73; \nPl.Ex. 41 at 28; Tr. 31-32. Class members are more likely to learn independent living skills \nin a family-type situation where there is continuous and constant opportunity to practice \nthose skills than in an institution. Tr. 32; Pl.Ex. 43 at 54; Pl.Ex. 44 at 13; Pl.Ex. 45 at 24-26. \nThe state psychiatric institutions provide very abnormal living environments. Tr. 31; Pl.Ex. \n45 at 36. As a result, treatment of class members is seriously compromised. Within the \nstate psychiatric hospitals, there are not enough structured activities to keep class members \n\n \nfrom developing inappropriate behaviors or losing independent living skills in the abnormal \ninstitutional environment. They learn to live in an institution, and their ability to be integrated \ninto the community and adapt to community life deteriorates. Glenn Dep. at 44-46, 132; Tr. \n90; Pl.Ex. 43 at 26-27. \nMentally retarded persons learn by observation, but they do not always have the insight to \ndistinguish appropriate from inappropriate behavior. Thus, when class members are \nconfined with mentally ill people, they copy the social behavior of the mentally ill patients. \nThis is called modeling. It further harms the class members and further reduces their \nchances of living in a normal setting. Glenn Dep. at 32-33; Pl.Ex. 41 at 4; Pl.Ex. 43 at 45-56; \nPl.Ex. 46 at 15. \nFor example, in April, 1986, the attending psychiatrist of named plaintiff Jeanette H. found \nthat Ms. H.'s behavior problems were caused by the fact that she was a retarded person \nresiding within a hospital geared to treat the mentally ill. Pl.Ex. 31 at 31. By January, 1987, \nthis psychiatrist recognized that Jeanette's behavior while residing within the hospital was \nchaotic, but that when she attended her sheltered workshop assignment in the community, \nshe was \"one of the best residents in attendance there.\" Pl.Ex. 31 at 46. \nv. Unavailable Services. \nThere is no dispute that class members need developmental training and structured \nprograms. This includes, for example, 1194*1194 training in basic self-care skills, \ncommunity living skills, speech therapy, and vocational services. Pl.Ex. 43 at 3, 11-13, 20; \nPl.Ex. 45 at 15, 32, 34, 39. Because vocational activities are often a key to greater \nindependence and enjoyment of liberty, they are for most class members an essential \nservice to avoid unnecessary restraint. Pl.Ex. 42 at 10, # 6. However, vocational services \nare not available to most class members. Pl.Ex. 19 at 3. Adequate programs for speech, \nbehavior, and self-care skills also are not available. Pl.Ex. 43 at 18; Glenn Dep. at 43-44, \n49, 55, 60; Pl.Ex. 43 at 15. \nClass members have little, if any, hope of maintaining or improving their self-care skills \nbecause they are not offered treatment designed for the learning disabled. Pl.Ex. 42 at 10, # \n6, and at 11, ## 1-3. Class member Jacob B. was at Cherry Hospital for twenty-two years. \nHe never went to school there. He is described as mentally disturbed because he talks to \nhis fingers out of boredom and loneliness. Pl.Ex. 43 at 28. He does very well in structured \nactivity but does not get what he needs, according to Secretary's experts. The Secretary \nterminated a greenhouse program he was in. Pl.Ex. 43 at 19. Other programs serving class \nmembers also have been terminated by the Secretary without regard to the needs of the \nclients. Pl.Ex. 43 at 2. \nvi. Behavior Problems. \nAs was true in the case of Thomas S., many class members have behavioral problems \nwhich make them difficult to treat. As was true for Thomas S., however, this difficulty does \nnot excuse the Secretary from providing appropriate placement and services. This court has \nalready stated that \"[p]eople with problems are rarely easy to deal with. If plaintiff were \n\n \n`normal,' then he would not need the treatment the professionals say he needs.\" Thomas \nS., 601 F.Supp. at 1058. \nThe Secretary's professionals admit that if a class member has a behavior problem, a \nspecific plan should be developed and implemented to reduce the inappropriate behavior by \nteaching him or her appropriate social behaviors. Pl.Ex. 44 at 12; Pl.Ex. 45 at 24-26; Tr. \n417. For the vast majority of class members, this has not been done. Pl.Ex. 42 at 11, # 5; \nGlenn Dep. at 22, 24-25, 31; Pl.Ex. 41 at 13-15, 17, 18a; Pl.Ex. 43 at 15; Pl.Ex. 46 at 15; Tr. \n496; Pl.Ex. 42 at 6-7. Intervenor Jeanette H. responded well to a token economy program in \n1984, but it was discontinued for reasons unrelated to her needs. Pl.Ex. 31 at 28. \nIntervenor Todd C.'s examining physician found that his adaptive level of functioning was \n\"under this patient's potential due to lack of resources to control behavioral disorder. A \nstructured environment and residential active treatment in a M.R. [mental retardation] \nprogram should improve his level of functioning and production.\" Pl.Ex. 30 at 2. This was \nnot provided until very recently. \nvii. Deterioration and Loss of Self-Care Skills. \nPeople with mental retardation have a problem maintaining the skills that they have. There \nis a significant risk that unless attention is paid to class members' developmental and \nhabilitation needs, their skills will atrophy and they will regress. Pl.Ex. 44 at 18-19. Some \nclass members have suffered a significant deterioration in the self-care skills they \npossessed when they were first admitted to the state's care. Some class members have \nbeen denied appropriate habilitation for so long that the Secretary has labeled them \ninstitutionalized and given up hope for them. Pl.Ex. 6 at 4. Magdeline S. has been at Dix \nHospital since 1930 when she was eleven years old. The Secretary admits that she is so \n\"institutionalized\" and \"regressed\" that community placement is considered by staff to be \nunrealistic in the absence of an appropriate mental retardation facility. Pl.Ex. 34; Pl.Ex. 42 \nat 9, ## 4(d)(1) and (2). Class member William D. was admitted to Broughton Hospital in \n1958. He was able to speak and make statements to the hospital interviewer when he was \nadmitted. By 1985, however, Mr. D. had regressed to the 1195*1195 point that he was \nconsidered to be nonverbal, and efforts to find a community placement for him were \nterminated. Pl.Ex. 37. \nAnother class member, Mary W., cannot feed herself at all. However, the records clearly \nshow that in 1946 she only needed to be spoonfed \"at times.\" Because of her self-abusive \nbehavior, she was tied down for extensive periods of time. Tr. 48. Her legs have therefore \natrophied so that she can no longer walk. She contracted tuberculosis in 1969 while in the \nhospital. She is now virtually mute, uttering two to four stereotyped, \"parrot-like\" words or \nphrases over and over. \nThe Secretary's failure to provide adequate evaluations, staff, humane and normal living \nconditions, and developmental and behavior programming is a record of failure to exercise \nprofessional judgment, making it clear that the state has not provided the professionals with \nminimally adequate resources for habilitation for plaintiffs. \n\n \n8. Lack of Adequate Community Services \nThe system administered by the Secretary is plagued by a severe lack of community \nresources for plaintiffs. This drought of community services results in the unnecessary \nconfinement of class members in highly restrictive settings for lack of another place to go, \njust as it did for Thomas S. Pl.Ex. 44 at 4, 30; Pl.Ex. 46 at 9-10; Tr. 123. This is true even \nwhen legal criteria for hospital admission are not met. Pl.Ex. 27; Tr. 128-29. It also \nfrustrates the exercise of professional judgment by mental health and mental retardation \nprofessionals who become discouraged by the futility, year after year, of recommending \nservices that do not exist. Tr. 115-17; Pl.Ex. 42 at 9-10, # 3; Pl.Ex. 46 at 9-10. \nMinimum standards require that plans be in place for moving class members to increasingly \nnormal settings. Pl.Ex. 41 at 5; Pl.Ex. 15. For many class members, this planning has not \nbeen accomplished. Glenn Dep. at 42, 56, 63-64; Pl.Ex. 9; Pl.Ex. 41 at 6, 7, 8, 16. Dix \nHospital has a recently adopted policy to discharge patients who are admitted for mental \nretardation with behavior disorder to the community or to O'Berry Mental Retardation Center \nwithin ninety days if at all possible. Tr. 364. However, the policy is not implemented \nbecause community programs are limited and O'Berry Center is full. Tr. 411-12. In \nMecklenburg County, hundreds of people are waiting to get into group homes. In Madison \nCounty, there are no group homes. Pl.Ex. 46 at 12. \nPlacement of mentally retarded adults in rest homes does not meet minimally acceptable \nprofessional standards, according to mental retardation professions within the state and \nwithout. Pl.Ex. 46 at 12-13; Tr. 124-25. Yet many institutionalized class members, including \nMargaret R., have previously been placed in rest homes. A task force report of the \nSecretary noted in 1982: \nAs it is now, many severely and profoundly mentally retarded clients are medicated — some \nheavily — and put in rest homes because they are not admittable to mental retardation care \nservices, but the rest home may be a less appropriate place for them in terms of their \nneeds. \nPl.Ex. 6 at 5. \nThe historic reliance on rest home placement with little or no follow-up perpetuates the \n\"revolving door\" readmissions of mentally retarded people to the state psychiatric \ninstitutions. Pl.Ex. 41 at 18. \nPlaintiff Jeanette H. was admitted to Dix in 1978 for behavior problems related to the fact \nthat she could not live at home and the lack of adequate community placements. She had \nbeen put in several inappropriate rest homes which offered no developmental or behavioral \nprogramming at all and where she exhibited aggressive behavior which caused her to be \nexpelled. She was kept at Dix and continuously given medication that did not improve her \nbehavior, but was not afforded adequate developmental or behavioral programming. She \nbecame pregnant while in the hospital. Her psychiatrist noted in 1980 that he saw no need \nfor her to be on antipsychotic drugs but commented that, \"[s]he will probably remain in the \nhospital indefinitely 1196*1196 since she has outbursts [of aggressive behavior] every \nseveral months ... and also because of her reputation amongst rest homes where she has \n\n \nbeen tried in the past....\" Def.Ex. 14 at 21-23 (emphasis added). No options such as adult \nfoster care placement (like that ordered for Thomas S.) or structured group homes were \navailable to be considered for Jeanette. \nThe Secretary has demonstrated that mentally retarded people with severe behavior \ndisorders, including individuals with mental illness, can receive appropriate treatment in a \ngroup home setting. However, the program was discontinued for reasons unrelated to the \nneeds of class members. Pl.Ex. 44 at 22-24. \nOne reason there are not enough community-based services is funding. In the past, the \nDivision allocated money for group homes, but there has not been an expansion in state-\nfunded group homes in years. Pl.Ex. 47 at 4-6. The professionals are ready to provide \nadequate services for class members, but funds are not available. Pl.Ex. 46 at 29. \nThe Secretary's policies and practices regarding allocation of resources to serve the needs \nof class members are based on political exigencies rather than on the best interests of the \nindividual class members, or even on cost effectiveness. Pl.Ex. 46 at 10. \n9. Professional Judgment \nThe lack of minimally adequate programs inside the psychiatric institutions and the lack of \ncommunity-based services throughout the state system run by the Secretary have \nprevented the exercise of professional judgment by the Secretary. This has been \ndemonstrated throughout the records of individual class members. \nThere is a tendency among human service professionals in the state psychiatric institutions \nto conform their recommendations for treatment or habilitation of class members to the \nconstraints imposed by the state's inadequate service delivery system, rather than to \nexercise true professional judgment. Tr. 114-15, 127. After recommendations are made that \ncan not be acted on, professionals stop making the recommendations. In many of the \ninstances where an institution clinical record contains a statement to the effect that \ncommunity placement is not appropriate for a particular client, the writer of the record is \nlikely referring to the limited nature of existing community resources rather than other types \nof community resources that should be developed in order to allow for the exercise of true \nprofessional judgment. Tr. 115-16. \nAt least one professional was threatened that his career would be jeopardized because of \nhis unwillingness to modify his professional judgment to conform with what was available in \nthe Secretary's institutions. He was also given false information about the time of a court \nhearing when he attempted to insist upon a course that was dictated in his professional \nopinion by the needs of the individual, but unavailable in the Secretary's system. Tr. 117, \n127. \nSome of the Secretary's agents who testified as psychiatric experts made statements in \nresponse to questioning by their lawyer that they personally exercised professional \njudgment or that they believed professional judgment was generally exercised on behalf of \nclass members at the psychiatric hospitals. Tr. 387, 395, 404, 406, 541, 557. They are not \n\n \nmental retardation professionals. Tr. 407-08, 556. These general statements conflict with \nstatements in the records and charts of class members in which recommendations for \ncommunity placement, short-term hospital stays, structured community programs, behavior \nplans and numerous other specific treatments were not carried out. See, e.g., Pl.Ex. 30; \nPl.Ex. 31; Pl.Ex. 33. These general statements also conflict with the testimony of plaintiffs' \nexperts and statements produced in internal memoranda and task force reports of \ndefendants in which class members are identified as needing services or community \nplacements that are not available. Pl.Ex. 6; Pl.Ex. 11; Pl.Ex. 12. The Secretary's agent, Dr. \nJerry Norton, gave testimony concerning intervenor Margaret R. that conflicts with the \nsubstance of a written statement signed by him in March of 1984, just prior to Ms. R.'s \n1197*1197 asking the court for leave to intervene. Pl.Ex. 26. Dr. Norton testified that he had \nchanged his mind. Tr. 523-24. These conflicts are resolved by the court on the basis of \ncredibility in favor of the opinions of plaintiffs' experts and in favor of the contemporaneous \ntreatment recommendations and observations made by the treating professionals in the \nplaintiffs' charts. Likewise, such conflicts are resolved in favor of the studies and internal \nmemoranda produced through discovery of the Secretary's agents who are working toward \nsolution of a known problem. \n10. Certification — Accreditation \nThe conditions and services at the state psychiatric institutions are substantially below \nminimally accepted professional standards; they include major violations of very basic \nhuman treatment standards. Pl.Ex. 41 at 4. \nAdhering to standards for mental retardation services is particularly important if the mentally \nretarded person also has mental illness or a behavior disorder, because the mental illness \nor behavior disorder cannot be treated in the absence of a developmental program. Glenn \nDep. at 67. Mental illness alone almost never makes developmental programming \nimpossible. Glenn Dep. at 93; Pl.Ex. 44 at 17. \nThe Secretary produced documentation that the four state psychiatric hospitals are licensed \nand accredited by the Joint Committee on Accreditation of Hospitals (\"JCAH\"). This is a \nprivate agency made up of the American Medical Association, American Hospital \nAssociation, and other health care groups. Tr. 530-31. Accreditation by JCAH does not \nsuffice to indicate that professional judgment is being exercised with regard to mental \nretardation services. Glenn Dep. at 134-36. Even the Secretary's expert on accreditation \nagrees with this. Tr. 567. The JCAH standards include some criteria which reflect upon the \nminimal adequacy of services for mentally retarded people. In some of these areas, the one \nJCAH survey report in the record shows serious deficiencies which support the conclusions \nof plaintiffs' experts. During the most recent JCAH survey at Broughton Hospital, in May, \n1986, surveyors found: \n(1) Minimal participation of patients and their guardians in treatment planning. \n(2) Insufficient professional and support staff to supervise and implement the treatment plan \nor provide adult educational services. \n\n \n(3) Inadequate or non-existent emotional, behavioral, activities, legal and vocational \nassessments. \n(4) Inadequate treatment plans and inadequate documentation of their implementation. \n(5) Use of special treatment procedures that are not justified in light of the harm they are \nknown to cause. \n(6) The use of seclusion and restraint where written justification is inadequate or non-\nexistent and where less intrusive methods were not considered. \n(7) Failure of the hospital administration to monitor the unwarranted use of seclusion and \nrestraint. \n(8) Failure of staff to note clients' response to activity services. \n(9) Failure to monitor and evaluate the quality and appropriateness of activity services. \n(10) Failure to provide adequate education services. \n(11) Violation of life safety standards. \nPl.Ex. 54. \nCertification by the Health Care Financing Administration (\"HCFA\") that a facility is eligible \nfor reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs does not indicate that \nprofessional judgment is being exercised with regard to mental retardation services. Like \nthe JCAH standards, the HCFA standards include some criteria which are necessary, but \nnot sufficient, for evaluating the minimal adequacy of services for mentally retarded people. \nIn some of these areas of overlap, the HCFA survey reports in the record show serious \ndeficiencies which support the conclusions of plaintiffs' experts. During a December, 1986, \nHCFA survey of Broughton Hospital, surveyors found: \n1198*1198 (1) Treatment planning is inadequate; \n(2) Goals for the client in the treatment plan are not individualized and are geared more to \nthe needs of the staff; \n(3) Treatment procedures are too vaguely stated; \n(4) It is often not clear which staff member is responsible for particular aspects of treatment; \n(5) Frequently, the only treatment ordered was medication and observation; \n(6) Where other treatment was ordered, it was frequently not relevant to the identified needs \nof the patient and frequently there was no documentation that treatment had been followed \nup; \n(7) In many cases, there were no progress notes to indicate how the patient was responding \nto the prescribed treatment; \n(8) There was inadequate social work for aftercare planning; and \n\n \n(9) There were too few psychiatrists. \nPl.Ex. 56. \nIn fact, HCFA found that Broughton did not meet the HCFA condition of participation. Pl.Ex. \n56. As a result, Broughton Hospital faced losing five to six million dollars per year in federal \nreimbursements. Tr. 572. Following negotiations between HCFA and state officials and the \nwriting by state officials of a plan for improving Broughton's operations, HCFA reversed its \ndecision despite its findings of deficiencies. Tr. 572-73. \nThe Medicaid standards for intermediate care facilities for mental retardation (\"ICF-MR\") are \naccepted by mental retardation professionals as minimally adequate. Glenn Dep. at 73-75. \nOf all of the residential units at the four state psychiatric hospitals housing class members, \nonly the Broughton Hospital's R Unit, serving seventy or more class members, has been \ncertified by ICF-MR surveyors. Although the Secretary's only witness to address the issue \ncredited ICF-MR standards as being authoritative, Tr. 484-85, the Secretary offered no \nevidence to explain why all the other units confining class members did not even attempt to \nbe ICF-MR certified. \nICF-MR certification does not mean that professional judgment is in fact being exercised at \nUnit R. The Secretary himself, through his agents, surveys for compliance. Tr. 481. The \nSecretary has a vested interest in receiving significant federal reimbursement as a result of \nfinding himself in compliance. Tr. 482, 489; Glenn Dep. at 75-77. On the one occasion when \nfederal officials themselves conducted the survey, Tr. 493, they found numerous significant \nviolations, but certified the R Unit nevertheless when state officials submitted a plan of \ncorrection. The federal officials found: \n(1) \"[I]nconsistent supervision in the delivery of individualized plans of care for residents, \nspecifically as to areas of health, hygiene, grooming and toilet training.\" \n(2) No evidence that the mental retardation professional \"had assured that all \nrecommendations were carried out.\" \n(3) Deficits in staff training concerning developmental needs and other issues. \n(4) Only custodial care in the living units. \n(5) Lack of privacy at shower time. \n(6) Lack of systematic training for residents to develop eating skills. \n(7) Failure to document drug reviews in the clients' record or make the reviews available to \nprofessional staff. \n(8) On ten of ten records reviewed, no evidence that the physical therapist had conducted \nan initial screening. \n(9) That recreation equipment was not visible and in enough quantity to carry out the stated \nobjectives of the activities program. \n\n \nPl.Ex. 53. These findings, made in 1985, while this suit was pending, supported in part the \nconclusions reached by plaintiffs' expert Linda Glenn. \nThe R Unit at Broughton Hospital is the only unit at any of the four state psychiatric \ninstitutions designed to house only mentally retarded adults. The evidence shows that it is \nsuperior to the general units in a number of respects. However, there is also evidence, in \naddition to that from the 1199*1199 above-described ICF-MR federal survey, to indicate \nproblems of a constitutional magnitude: \n(a) Not all residents of R Unit have received interdisciplinary evaluations. There were no \nindividual programming goals related to the assessed needs of many class members. Glenn \nDep. at 50, 118; Pl.Ex. 41 at 6, 16. \n(b) There was no way to coordinate activities some residents attend during the day and the \nactivities on the ward where they spend the rest of their time. Glenn Dep. at 118. \n(c) The programs to meet the needs of residents were limited. One-third of those whose \nrecords were reviewed by plaintiffs' expert Glenn received less than two hours of daily \nprogram activity. Pl.Ex. 41 at 6, 16. \n(d) In her review, Ms. Glenn found mechanical restraints being used without an \naccompanying behavior program. Pl.Ex. 41 at 6. \n(e) The behavior programs that did exist were not always appropriate. Glenn Dep. at 117. \n(f) According to plaintiffs' expert Linda Glenn, the R Unit violates the following very basic \nhuman treatment standards: (1) human environment; (2) freedom from undue restrictions; \nand (3) opportunities to experience ordinary activities. Pl.Ex. 41 at 4; Glenn Dep. at 48-52, \n32-33. \n(g) The Secretary's expert Dr. Szymanski agreed with Linda Glenn that R Unit appeared too \ninstitutional. Pl.Ex. 43 at 4. \n(h) Many R Unit residents do not have the chance to visit the outside world regularly and \nsocialize with people of normal intelligence, other than staff. Pl.Ex. 46 at 17-18. \n(i) A number of residents on R Unit have been confined there for over ten years. Pl.Ex. 2 at \n3-4. \n(j) According to state officials, a large number of the residents of R Unit need to live in a \nregular group home. Pl.Ex. 8 at 2. \nIII. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA. Substantive Due Process Rights Under Youngberg \nv. Romeo \nThe legal obligation of the Secretary to provide treatment to class members which \nembodies the exercise of professional judgment has been established by the court's entry \n\n \nof judgment in favor of the named individual plaintiff, Thomas S. That judgment stands as \nthe law of this case. \nIn certifying the class pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 23(b)(2), the court stated: \nDefendant Morrow [now Flaherty] is responsible for providing treatment for those mentally \nretarded adults in the state's care. The state system that has been developed for treatment \nand the alleged deficiencies in the system are applicable to the entire class. Therefore, if \nthe class prevails, final injunctive relief or declaratory relief is appropriate. \nOrder, December 7, 1984 (Docket # 133). \nThe constitutional foundations for class members' right to treatment, and the applicable \ncase law were articulated at length in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, \n73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), in this court's order granting summary judgment for Thomas S., \nThomas S. v. Morrow, 601 F.Supp. 1055 (W.D.N.C.1984), and in the Court of Appeals \ndecision affirming summary judgment. Thomas S. v. Morrow, 781 F.2d 367 (4th Cir.1986). \nThe Thomas S. decision has already received favorable attention and acceptance from \nother circuits. See, e.g., Clark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d 79 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 962, \n107 S.Ct. 459, 93 L.Ed.2d 404 (1986). \nThe constitutional right of class members to treatment comporting with the judgment of \nqualified professionals is established. Two questions remain to be decided by the court: \n1. Have the constitutional rights of class members or the intervenors to receive appropriate \ntreatment been denied by the Secretary? \n2. If class members' or intervenors' rights to treatment have been denied, then what relief \nshould the court order? \n1200*1200 Plaintiffs claim that the Secretary has violated their substantive due process \nrights to safety, freedom of bodily movement, and \"minimally adequate or reasonable \ntraining to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319, \n102 S.Ct. at 2459. \nTo decide whether plaintiffs' constitutional rights have been violated, the court must \ndetermine whether the Secretary acted reasonably. Assuming that legitimate state interests \nare implied, the balancing test for determining what is reasonable is whether or not \nprofessional judgment has in fact been exercised. The courts must show deference to the \njudgment exercised by qualified professionals. Id. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. \nThe decision [to treat a certain way], if made by a professional, is presumptively valid; \nliability may be imposed only when the decision by the professional is such a substantial \ndeparture from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate \nthat the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment. \nId. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. \n\n \nThe qualified professional decision maker is \"a person competent, whether by education, \ntraining or experience to make the particular decision at issue.\" Id. at 323 n. 30, 102 S.Ct. at \n2462 n. 30. Accordingly, this court has ordered that the treatment furnished to the initial \nnamed plaintiff, Thomas S., be \"based on recommendations formulated by qualified \nprofessionals who are familiar with his treatment needs and acting within their respective \nareas of expertise relevant to the issue being considered.\" Judgment, December 7, 1984, at \n2 (Docket # 135). \nThe plaintiffs are \"entitled to treatment recommended by qualified professionals whose \njudgment is unsullied by consideration of the fact that the state does not provide appropriate \ntreatment or funding for appropriate treatment.\" Thomas S., 601 F.Supp. at 1060. \nProfessional judgment probably was not exercised if it was \"modified to conform to available \ntreatment rather than appropriate treatment.\" Id. See also Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 673 F.Supp. \n828, 835 (N.D.Tex.1987). With regard to some class members, the Secretary has failed to \nimplement professional recommendations. With regard to other class members, \nprofessionals have modified their judgment to conform to available treatment rather than \nappropriate treatment (a human reaction). The law of this case also is that the \"[l]ack of \nfunding or of established alternatives is not a factor which may be considered in determining \nthe scope\" of the constitutional right. Thomas S., 601 F.Supp. at 1059. \nWe turn now to discuss the implications for the class of the three rights enunciated in \nYoungberg. \n1. Safety. \nIn the context of this case, the class members' constitutional liberty interest in safety \nencompasses reasonable protection from aggression by others, protection from self-abuse \nwhich can be prevented, and the proper use of basic adaptive equipment and techniques to \nreduce the risk of physical deterioration among people who cannot walk by themselves. The \nliberty interest in safety also includes freedom from hazardous drugs which are not shown \nto be necessary, used in excessive dosages, or used in the absence of appropriate \nmonitoring for adverse effects. \n2. Freedom from Undue Bodily Restraint. \nIn the context of this case, the class members' constitutional liberty interest in avoiding \nbodily restraint encompasses freedom from being unnecessarily tied or shackled to a bed or \na chair, freedom from solitary confinement except in emergencies, freedom from \nunnecessary confinement in a locked ward, and not being unnecessarily deported for long \nperiods to psychiatric hospitals which they may not leave to rejoin their home community. \n3. Minimally Adequate Habilitation. \nPlaintiffs have the constitutional right to minimally adequate habilitation in a setting \ndesigned to reduce self-abuse and 1201*1201 aggression. That means habilitation which \nwill tend to render unnecessary the use of chemical restraint, shackles, solitary \n\n \nconfinement, locked wards, or prolonged isolation from one's normal community; and \nconditions of life which are normal enough to promote rather than detract from one's \nchances of living with fewer restrictions on one's movement. \nClass members also have a constitutional right to habilitation which is minimally adequate to \nmaintain basic self-care skills. In a concurring opinion in Youngberg, Justice Blackmun, \njoined by Justices Brennan and O'Connor, argued that minimally adequate training includes \n\"such training as is reasonably necessary to prevent a person's pre-existing self-care skills \nfrom deteriorating....\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 327, 102 S.Ct. at 2464. The court in ARC of \nNorth Dakota v. Olson, citing Justice Blackmun's concurrence, found a \"right to reasonable \ntraining which enables the resident to acquire or maintain minimum self-care skills — skills \nin feeding, bathing, dressing, self-control, and toilet training.\" 561 F.Supp. 473, 487 (D.N.D. \n1982), aff'd on other grounds, 713 F.2d 1384 (8th Cir.1983). As the Court explained: \nGiven the great difference that minimum self-care skills make in the life of most mentally \nretarded persons, this court regards the acquisition and maintenance of those skills as \nessential to the exercise of basic liberties. Not only will these skills free residents from the \nrestraint of others who now \"help\" the residents perform basic functions, these skills will \nalso enable the residents to do a great variety of activities which formerly they could not. \nId.

Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1250 (2d \nCir.1984). \nThe intervenors and the class have established by clear and convincing evidence and by a \npreponderance of the evidence that their constitutional rights under Youngberg have been \nviolated by the Secretary. Specifically, the court concludes that: \n1. The Secretary has failed to provide reasonably safe conditions of confinement for \nplaintiffs committed to the state psychiatric hospitals. \n2. The plaintiffs have been subjected to unreasonable bodily restraints. \n3. The Secretary has failed to provide the plaintiffs with minimally adequate habilitation that \nis reasonable in light of the circumstances of this case. \n4. The Secretary has consistently failed to implement the recommendations of the state's \ntreating professionals. \n5. In many instances, the treatment afforded to the plaintiffs was not the result of the \nexercise of professional judgment. \n6. The Secretary's decision to confine mentally retarded persons with no diagnosis of \nmental illness in state psychiatric hospitals is such a substantial departure from accepted \nprofessional judgment, practice and standards as to demonstrate that the decision is not a \nfunction of independent professional judgment within the meaning of Youngberg. \n7. The Secretary's decision to place mentally retarded persons on general psychiatric wards \nis such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice and \nstandards as to demonstrate that the decision is not a function of independent professional \njudgment within the meaning of Youngberg. \n\n \n8. The Secretary's decision to seclude and mechanically restrain the plaintiffs without \nemploying behavioral treatment programs is such a substantial departure from accepted \nprofessional judgment, practice, and standards as to demonstrate that the decision is not a \nfunction of independent professional judgment within the meaning of Youngberg. \n9. The Secretary's decision to administer antipsychotic drugs at the levels and under the \nconditions found to 1202*1202 exist in the state psychiatric hospitals is such a substantial \ndeparture from accepted professional judgment, practice and standards as to demonstrate \nthat the decision is not a function of independent professional judgment within the meaning \nof Youngberg. \n10. The Secretary's decision to ignore the community placement recommendations of the \nstate's treating professionals is such a substantial departure from accepted professional \njudgment, practice and standards as to demonstrate that the decision is not a function of \nindependent professional judgment within the meaning of Youngberg. \n11. The plaintiffs are mechanically and chemically restrained beyond the extent necessary \nto assure their safety or to provide needed training. \n12. The Secretary has failed to provide the training necessary to insure the plaintiffs' safety \nand to facilitate their ability to function free from bodily restraints. \n13. The Secretary has subjected plaintiffs to conditions in which plaintiffs inevitably learn \nmaladaptive behaviors, making it harder for them to adjust to community living and resulting \nin deprivation of plaintiffs' liberty. \n14. If the Secretary provided appropriate habilitation services, the plaintiffs would be \nsubjected to far less bodily restraint. The plaintiffs would then also have substantially \ndecreased likelihood of self-injurious or assaultive behavior. \n15. The Secretary may not use the existence of behavior problems as an excuse for failing \nto provide a plaintiff with minimally adequate habilitation or to follow the recommendations \nof treating professionals that class members be placed in community-based programs. \nThomas S. v. Morrow, 601 F.Supp. at 1058. \n16. The conditions of confinement imposed on the plaintiffs are more restrictive than is \nreasonable under the circumstances. \n17. Neither JCAH accreditation nor HCFA certification constitutes prima facie proof that \nqualified professional judgment is being exercised for the developmental needs of people \nwith mental retardation. However, if these certifications did constitute such proof, they have \nbeen rebutted by overwhelming contrary evidence. \n18. The plaintiffs have rebutted the prima facie proof of adequate care and treatment which \narises from evidence of ICF/MR accreditation of the R Unit at Broughton Hospital. \n19. The Secretary has failed to provide minimally adequate training necessary to prevent \nthe class members' pre-existing self-care skills from deteriorating because of their \ncommitment to state psychiatric hospitals. \n\n \nB. State Created Liberty Interest Related to Purpose of \nConfinement \nThe nature and duration of a person's confinement by the state must bear some reasonable \nrelation to the purpose of the confinement. Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738, 92 S.Ct. \n1845, 1858, 32 L.Ed. 2d 435 (1972). In North Carolina, in addition to the purpose of safety \nimplicit in the involuntary commitment standard, the stated purposes of treatment are \nindividualized treatment to \"maximize the development or restoration of a person's \ncapabilities,\" N.C. Gen.Stat. § 122C-51 (1986), and eliminating, reducing, or preventing the \ndisabling effects of mental retardation and mental illness in the least restrictive appropriate \nsetting. N.C.Gen.Stat. § 122C-2 (1986). Although plaintiffs have been deprived of this state-\ncreated liberty interest without due process, the court does not decide the case on this \nbasis. \nC. State-Created Liberty Interests Based on State \nRegulations \nIn the case of the individual plaintiff, Thomas S., this court considered plaintiffs' 1203*1203 \nclaim that certain state statutes created protected liberty interests assuring their right to \ntreatment. The court held that it did not need to decide the case based upon these claims \nsince the case could be decided based solely on substantive rights derived from the \nFourteenth Amendment. 601 F.Supp. at 1061. \nAs with the state statutes cited by plaintiffs, regulations promulgated by the Secretary could \ngive plaintiffs additional constitutionally protected rights to treatment. The Secretary's \nregulations governing class members' treatment in the state psychiatric hospitals provide in \npart: \nSection .01000 — Right to Treatment or Habilitation \n* * * * * * \n(b) Each client has the right to receive appropriate treatment or habilitation, and to have an \nindividual written treatment or habilitation plan as specified in G.S. 122-55.5 and 122-55.6. \nAll handicapped clients have a right to habilitation and rehabilitation as specified in G.S. \n168-8. \n(c) Each client has the right to receive evaluation and treatment or habilitation in the least \nrestrictive environment which includes: \n(1) Freedom from unnecessary or excessive medication as specified in 10 NCAC 14F \n.0600; and \n(2) Freedom from physical restraint and isolation that is not absolutely necessary. \nDef.Ex. 11. \n\n \nAlthough the state-created liberty interests asserted by plaintiffs would be sufficient to \nsupport relief, the court need not decide the case on those grounds. Plaintiffs' rights flowing \ndirectly from the Fourteenth Amendment are sufficient to support the relief ordered. \nD. Freedom of Association \nPlaintiffs also claim that the Secretary has violated their constitutional right to freedom of \nassociation. Plaintiffs, like other citizens, have a constitutional right to freedom of \nassociation. The Fourteenth Amendment protects from state interference the First \nAmendment right of citizens to freedom of association. Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 81 \nS.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed. 2d 231 (1960). Freedom of association is a fundamental right, implicit in \nthe concept of ordered liberty. NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d \n1488 (1958). The right includes freedom from state coerced association. \"Freedom of \nassociation ... plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.\" Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, \n468 U.S. 609, 623, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3252, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984) (citing Abood v. Detroit \nBd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 234-35, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 1799-1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977)). \nEven an indirect infringement on associational rights is impermissible and subject to the \nclosest scrutiny. Id.; Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 183, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2347, 33 L.Ed.2d \n266 (1972). \nThe constitutional guarantee not only protects an individual's associations with others for \nthe purpose of advancing shared political and religious beliefs, but encompasses the right \nsimply to meet with others and applies to social and personal associations. Wilson v. Taylor, \n733 F.2d 1539, 1543 (11th Cir.1984); Sawyer v. Sandstrom, 615 F.2d 311, 316 (5th \nCir.1980). Every person in a democratic society has the right to select who her/his \nassociates will be in order to express her/his distinct preferences. Gilmore v. City of \nMontgomery, 417 U.S. 556, 575, 94 S.Ct. 2416, 2427, 41 L.Ed.2d 304 (1974). Any state \naction which directly interferes with this right, or has the effect of chilling the \"free play of the \nspirit,\" is proscribed by the Constitution. Shelton, 364 U.S. at 487, 81 S.Ct. at 251. \nMoreover, the state cannot compel an individual to choose between exercising his or her \nFirst Amendment rights and participating in an otherwise available program. Thomas v. \nReview Board, 450 U.S. 707, 716, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1431, 67 L.Ed. 2d 624 (1981). \nThe application of First Amendment principles to persons in institutions has been \nacknowledged in Olson, 561 F.Supp. 473. The Olson court explicitly held that the First \nAmendment guarantees the right to freedom of association for residents who 1204*1204 \nhave mental retardation. Id. at 492. Implicit in the right to freedom of association is the \nrequirement that the state provide reasonable opportunities for communication with others, \nboth inside and outside the institutional walls, to all residents who are capable of \ncommunicating. Id. \nPlaintiffs have a constitutional right to associate with non-institutionalized persons and with \npersons of their choice. Members of the plaintiff class have been unnecessarily \ncongregated and segregated together in large institutions. Consequently, they are \nforeclosed from choosing their associates and from socializing with non-handicapped or \nnon-institutionalized individuals. They are forced to associate almost exclusively with \ninstitutionalized, mentally disabled people and institution staff. In some cases, an acute \nepisode of mental illness may justify a temporary restriction on a person's associational \n\n \nrights. However, in this case the evidence demonstrates that such a justification often does \nnot exist, or that constraint on association persists long after the justification has subsided. \nBecause of the lack of services in the community, plaintiffs are essentially compelled to \nchoose between the exercise of their First Amendment right to freedom of association and \nparticipation in a state program of care and habilitation. This pattern of segregation and \ncongregation prohibits free association and leads to further denial of free association \nbecause it is self-perpetuating. \nThe plaintiffs' right to freedom of association has been violated, as has their right to \nhabilitation necessary to ensure that right. Thus, plaintiffs would be entitled to relief on this \nground. However, the court does not decide the case on that ground. \nIV. RELIEF \nBased on the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the plaintiffs are entitled to \nprospective relief, including orders to insure: \n(a) protection from aggression and self-abuse; \n(b) safe drug practices; \n(c) no unnecessary reliance on shackles, solitary confinement, and other forms of bodily \nrestraint; and \n(d) habilitation characterized by: \n(1) adequate evaluations; \n(2) recognition of the different needs of individuals; \n(3) enough adequately trained staff; \n(4) humane living conditions; \n(5) a training setting which approximates the more normal environment against which their \nincreasing independence will be measured; \n(6) the availability of specific developmental services such as special education and \nvocational training; \n(7) appropriate attention, where necessary, to behavioral problems; \n(8) the development of individual plans for moving class members to more normal settings; \nand \n(9) the provision of alternative habilitation settings where professional recommendations \ncan be carried out. \nThe evidence also shows that some class members have suffered injury from \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement under the Secretary's care and control. \n\n \nTherefore, in addition to the foregoing prospective relief, individual class members have a \nright to any treatment necessary to remedy any injury that has been caused by their \nconstitutionally inappropriate treatment in the past. \nIn Clark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d 79 (3rd Cir.1986), the court found that a mentally retarded \nindividual who had been wrongfully confined in a state hospital for a number of years \nwithout meaningful review of the involuntary commitment was entitled to treatment \nnecessary to remedy the effects of this wrongful confinement. In so holding, the court cited \nThomas S. v. Morrow, 781 F.2d 367 (4th Cir.1986), with clear approval. \nUnder Youngberg, class members are entitled to minimally adequate treatment consistent \nwith professional judgment to protect their constitutional liberty interests. However, the class \nmembers who have been injured as a result of defendant's 1205*1205 failure to provide this \nminimal level of constitutionally prescribed treatment are entitled to much broader relief if \nnecessary to cure the lingering effects of historic mistreatment. In Bazemore v. Friday, 478 \nU.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986), the Supreme Court held the State of \nNorth Carolina responsible for curing the effects of discrimination that continued after \ndesegregation of the state agriculture extension service. Similarly, in Milliken v. Bradley, \n433 U.S. 267, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977) (Milliken II), the Court held that \nprospective remedial relief was clearly appropriate to address the effects of historic \ndiscrimination. In that case, the Court upheld remedial reading programs and counseling for \nblack students against Michigan's claims that such relief would be barred by the Eleventh \nAmendment. The Court relied heavily upon Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of \nEducation, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). As with other equitable \nremedies, the nature of the desegregation remedy is to be determined by the nature and \nscope of the constitutional violation. The remedy should be designed \"to restore the victims \nof discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such \nconduct.\" Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 746, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3128, 41 L.Ed. 2d 1069 \n(1974) (Milliken I). These cases are instructive because, in this case, the evidence shows \nthat some class members will need special treatment to remedy the harm caused by \nconstitutionally inadequate treatment that they received while hospitalized under the care \nand control of the Secretary. \nFinally, exceptional circumstances exist to warrant the appointment of a special master to \nhold hearings and make recommendations to the court about: (a) the identity of class \nmembers; (b) whether and to what extent each of those individuals' constitutional rights \nhave been violated; and (c) the scope of further appropriate individual relief. \nIndividual class members, in the proceedings before the special master, are entitled to the \nbenefit of certain presumptions supported by findings about the class generally. Cf. \nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 358-62 & n. 45, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1866-68 & n. 45, \n52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (success at the initial, \"liability\" stage of a Title VII class action suit \ncreates a rebuttable presumption in favor of individual relief at the second, \"remedial\" stage \nof trial). Therefore, in making future recommendations to the court for individual members of \nthe class, the special master shall operate upon the following rebuttable presumptions: \n(a) That the Secretary has violated the rights of individual class members as set out in the \nforegoing conclusions of law, by providing treatment in the psychiatric hospitals which is a \n\n \nsubstantial departure from professional judgment as to minimally adequate treatment for \nmentally retarded persons; \n(b) That the individual class members have not received minimally adequate developmental \nservices; and \n(c) That except in the Lineberger Building while it was operating as a mental retardation \nunit, and on the R Unit at Broughton Hospital, no qualified mental retardation professional \nwas exercising judgment on behalf of class members. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \nORDER \nThis court has entered a memorandum opinion containing detailed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law. Based upon those findings and conclusions, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, \nADJUDGED AND DECREED: \n1. Plaintiff class members have the following constitutional rights in their treatment in the \nNorth Carolina psychiatric institutions: \nA. Safety, protection from harm, and treatment under safe conditions. \nB. Freedom from undue restraint. \nC. Minimally adequate habilitation or treatment as described in the conclusions of law: \ni. Minimally adequate habilitation designed to reduce self-abuse. \n1206*1206 ii. A habilitation setting minimally adequate to reduce the likelihood of \naggression or self-abuse. \niii. Habilitation which will tend to render unnecessary the use of chemical restraint, shackles, \nsolitary confinement, locked wards, or prolonged isolation from one's normal community. \niv. Conditions of life which are normal enough to promote rather than detract from one's \nchances of living with fewer restrictions on one's movement. \nv. Minimally adequate habilitation to maintain basic self-care skills. \nvi. Habilitation which does not require class members to spend long periods of time in state \npsychiatric institutions without developmental services. \nvii. Habilitation which does not require class members to spend any time in state psychiatric \ninstitutions if those class members have no mental illness or behavior disorder. \nD. Further, individual class members have a right to any treatment necessary to remedy any \ninjuries caused by their constitutionally inappropriate treatment in the past. \n2. The defendant Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources \n(\"Secretary\") and his agents are hereby enjoined from treating class members in a manner \n\n \nthat violates the constitutional rights of class members specified above. To assure that class \nmembers receive this constitutionally prescribed treatment, the court orders the relief \nspecified below. \n3. First, the Secretary shall identify all present class members within 45 days of this order. \nIn making this identification, it shall be presumed that mentally retarded adults (and those \nwho have been treated as retarded) who have been confined in a psychiatric institution at \nany time since March 22, 1984, have had their constitutional rights violated. \n4. Also, within 45 days, the Secretary shall insure that a system is in place for identifying \nnew class members, that is, adults with mental retardation who enter the psychiatric \ninstitution after the date of this order. \n5. The individual treatment needs of each class member shall then be independently \nevaluated to determine whether minimally adequate treatment consistent with constitutional \nstandards is being provided, and to determine whether each class member has been \ninjured as a result of constitutionally inadequate treatment by the Secretary in the past. \nThese evaluations shall be conducted by qualified mental retardation professionals not \npresently employed by the State of North Carolina, or any local government agency. The \nparties shall confer and attempt to select these professionals by mutual agreement. \n6. If the treatment of any class member does not meet constitutional standards consistent \nwith this order, the Secretary will be required to provide appropriate treatment. Similarly, if \nany class member has suffered injury as a result of constitutionally inadequate treatment, \nthe Secretary will be required to furnish any treatment necessary to remedy the harm \ncaused by his violation of class members' constitutional rights. \n7. Treatment shall be monitored for a sufficient period of time to assure that the Secretary \ncomplies in furnishing treatment required under this order. To that end, the Secretary is \nhereby ordered to submit reports to the court, the master and counsel for plaintiffs detailing \nhis progress in furnishing constitutionally adequate treatment to class members. The first \nreport shall be due 90 days from entry of this order and shall be submitted quarterly \nthereafter for two years. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted every six months. When the \nSecretary is able to show the court that all class members are receiving constitutionally \nrequired treatment and treatment required for remediation of injuries, and when the \nSecretary can show the court that further judicial monitoring of this order is not necessary, \nthe court will consider a motion for relief from this order. \n8. To assure that the individual class members receive constitutionally required 1207*1207 \nand remedial treatment, the court will order appointment of a special master. The parties \nshall confer and attempt to propose by mutual agreement individuals who could be \nappointed to serve as special master. The court will then conduct a hearing to review \nnominees, appoint the master and issue a more specific order of reference. The master's \nresponsibilities, consistent with Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and subject \nto a more specific order of reference to be issued at a later date, shall be: \na. To hear and report on disputes concerning individual mentally retarded adults' inclusion \nin the class for purposes of relief; \n\n \nb. To hear and report on disputes concerning the adequacy of treatment being furnished to \nany class member under the terms of this order; and \nc. To monitor and report on the Secretary's overall compliance with the terms of this order. \nThe Secretary shall be liable for paying the salary and expenses of the special master. \n9. Periodic evaluations of treatment received by class members shall be conducted by the \nSecretary at least annually. If there is a change in the needs of class members or other \ncircumstances warranting modification of this order, the parties shall confer and attempt in \ngood faith to propose a modified order consistent with the changed treatment needs or \nother circumstances. Plaintiffs' attorneys and agents shall be granted ready access to client \nrecords and other information concerning treatment needs of class members. In fulfilling \ntheir monitoring functions, plaintiffs' counsel shall advise the court as to whether the terms \nof this order are being carried out and whether the treatment of class members otherwise \nreflects the exercise of accepted professional judgment. \n10. The remedial treatment of class members shall be provided in a manner which \npromotes their independence, enhances their dignity, and is as consistent as possible with \nsocietal norms, in view of class members' special needs. \n11. The Secretary shall assure that service providers who shall furnish class members with \ntreatment under this order shall be guided by the decisions and opinions of qualified mental \nretardation professionals and other qualified professionals involved with their treatment and \nacting within their respective areas of expertise in making the particular decisions at issue. \n12. This order shall be binding upon the Secretary and his successors in office, his agents, \nand those to whom they have assigned or may assign any duties or responsibilities for the \ncare and treatment of class members. \n[1] David T. Flaherty succeeded Phillip J.
