    "summary": "<p>The Clean Air Act of 1963 preempts states from regulating vehicle emissions, but waived this preemption in California in 1967 in recognition of the state&rsquo;s technical innovation in this area. California state law reflected this waiver, and between 2023 and 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted California&rsquo;s requests for three waivers concerning regulation on Advanced Clean Trucks, Advanced Clean Cars, and Omnibus Low NOx. On May 22, 2025, Congress adopted three resolutions disproving these waivers, stating that they were unlawful under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 12, 2025, eleven states &mdash; &nbsp;California, Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington &mdash; represented by the Attorney&rsquo;s General of their respective states, filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the United States of America, President Donald Trump, and the Environmental Protection Agency and its Administrator. The plaintiffs argued that Congress did not have the power to negate a state rule after decades of the federal waiver existing. They contended that the defendants actions were (1) ultra vires, (2) arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), (3) unenforceable under the CRA, (4) a violation of the take care clause of Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, (5) a violation of the separation of powers principle, (6) a violation of the principles of federalism in the Tenth Amendment, and (7) defiance of federal law by federal officials. The plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief with the ultimate objective of allowing EPA waivers to stand and declaring the congressional resolutions unlawful.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Haywood S. Gilliam.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A series of groups went on to file motions to intervene as plaintiffs and defendants in the case. First, an association of over three dozen companies focused on promoting the adoption of electric vehicles, the Zero Emission Transport Association (ZETA), filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff on July 25. Then, on August 4, thirteen corn growers' associations filed a motion to intervene as defendants, arguing that the Clean Air Act waivers for California allowed the state to abruptly cut off the sale of internal combustion vehicles (which use corn as a primary source for the ethanol in gasoline) and disrupt supply chains. On August 6, another group filed a motion to intervene as defendants, consisting of 3 companies: American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute, and the National Association of Convenience Stores. They aimed to represent &ldquo;producers, refiners, distributors, and retailers&rdquo; of fuel in the U.S. On September 5, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation and the National Automobile Dealers Association filed a motion to intervene as defendants. On September 15, Western States Trucking Association, Inc., and Construction Industry Air Quality Coalition, Inc. filed the same motion.</p>\r\n<p>The EPA went on to file a motion to dismiss on September 19. In the motion, the defendants argued that all three of California&rsquo;s recent waivers should be struck in accordance with Congress&rsquo;s regulations and that the action should be dismissed in its entirety.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff states submitted a notice of two other pending actions on September 26, Daimler Truck N. Am. LLC v. Cal. Air Res. Bd. and Am. Free Enter. Chamber of Com. v. Engine Mfrs. Ass&rsquo;n, &nbsp;stating that these suits substantially overlapped with the case in question, and acknowledging that transfer may be appropriate if necessary.</p>\r\n<p>On October 3, the defendants filed a stipulation and proposed order requesting a delay on their response deadline in light of the government shutdown on October 1. The court granted the stipulation on the same day, moving the deadline to the prospective end date of the shutdown.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing</p>",

When Congress directed the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n3  to regulate harmful emissions from new motor vehicles, 42 U.S.C. § 7521(a), it also preempted \n4  States from setting such standards, id. § 7543(a).  But, recognizing that California had already \n5  developed deep expertise in vehicle emissions control and that the State suffers from severe air \n6  pollution challenges, Congress directed EPA to “waive” this preemption for California, unless \n7  record evidence supports one of three limited bases for declining to do so.  Id. § 7543(b)(1).   \n8  2.  Congress’s choice to allow California “to continue and expand its pioneering efforts” \n9  (pursuant to preemption waivers granted by EPA) has meant that the State “act[s] as a kind of \n10  laboratory for innovation” for vehicular emission controls, thereby advancing a core value of \n11  federalism while encouraging technological innovation for the protection of public health and \n12  welfare.  Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass’n, Inc. v. EPA (“MEMA I”), 627 F.2d 1095, 1111 (D.C. Cir. \n13  1979); see also New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 386-87 (1932) (Brandeis, J., \n14  dissenting) (“It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state \n15  may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments \n16  without risk to the rest of the country.”). \n17  3.  This Clean Air Act waiver provision was enacted in 1967, and EPA has granted \n18  California more than seventy-five preemption waivers for updates to the State’s new motor \n19  vehicle emissions control program.  As Congress intended, these waivers have allowed California \n20  to “improve on ‘its already excellent program,’” to foster technological advancements, and to \n21  protect Californians from harmful pollution.  See MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1110 (quoting S. Rep. No. \n22  403, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1967)).   \n23  4.  Between April 2023 and January 2025, EPA granted California’s requests for three \n24  Clean Air Act preemption waivers, authorizing enforcement of the State’s latest additions to its \n25  regulatory program, including the Advanced Clean Trucks, Advanced Clean Cars II, and \n26  Omnibus Low NOx (“Omnibus”) regulations.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 20,688 (Apr. 6, 2023); 90 Fed. \n27  Reg. 642 (Jan. 6, 2025); 90 Fed. Reg. 643 (Jan. 6, 2025).  Pursuant to Section 177 of the Clean \n28 \n   1   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 3 of 43\n \n1  Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7507, other States—including Plaintiffs here—have adopted these California \n2  standards as their own.  \n3  5.  On May 22, 2025, the Senate joined the House in adopting three Resolutions, \n4  purporting to “disapprove[]” these waivers.  H.J. Res. 87, 88, 89 (119th Congress). \n5  (“Resolutions”).  The President signed the Resolutions on June 12, 2025.  In so doing, the Federal \n6  Government “singled out” these waivers—and the underlying California regulations—for an \n7  unprecedented attack, South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U.S. 505, 513 (1988), employing a statute—\n8  the Congressional Review Act (CRA)—deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and \n9  expert who analyzed the question.  The Plaintiff States—California, Colorado, Delaware, \n10  Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and \n11  Washington—challenge these unlawful Resolutions, which purport to prevent these States from \n12  enforcing laws they have chosen to adopt within their jurisdictions. \n13  6.  The CRA was enacted to facilitate congressional review of certain federal agency \n14  rules.  5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A); id. § 804(3) (defining “rule”).  Where it applies, it creates a \n15  narrow exception to the filibuster that enables the Senate to adopt a resolution disapproving of a \n16  federal agency’s rule with a simple majority vote.  Id. § 802(d)(1).  The CRA also limits Senate \n17  debate over a given resolution to a maximum of five hours per side.  Id. § 802(d)(2).  If a CRA \n18  resolution disapproving of a federal agency’s rule is enacted, the targeted rule ceases to have legal \n19  effect.  Id. § 801(b)(1).  And “a new rule that is substantially the same … may not be issued,” \n20  absent further, specific congressional authorization.  Id. § 801(b)(2). \n21  7.  While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited \n22  procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a \n23  means for Congress to negate state rules.  Nor would any State have done so.  States do not so \n24  easily surrender “the dignity … of sovereignty” they retain in our system of government.  Alden \n25  v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 715 (1999).     \n26  8.  Cabining the CRA to federal rules is also consistent with the principle that the \n27  Federal Government does not “impose its will on the States … lightly”—e.g., through a process \n28  with severely constrained debate.  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).  To the \n   2   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 4 of 43\n \n1  contrary, the Framers intentionally designed the Federal Government to “partake sufficiently of \n2  the spirit [of the States]” such that it would “be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual \n3  States, or the prerogatives of their governments.”  Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., \n4  469 U.S. 528, 551 (1985) (quoting The Federalist No. 46, p. 332).   \n5  9.  The Federal Government ran roughshod over federalism and separation of powers \n6  principles in applying the CRA to these three preemption waiver decisions.  It did so despite \n7  EPA’s decades-old, consistent position—reiterated in each of the three actions at issue—that \n8  preemption waiver decisions are not “rules” and, accordingly, “the Congressional Review Act … \n9  does not apply.”  E.g., 88 Fed. Reg. 20,688, 20,726 (Apr. 6, 2023).  The Federal Government also \n10  blithely disregarded the legal conclusions of every nonpartisan arbiter upon whom Congress \n11  otherwise relies for determining the CRA’s applicability—all of whom concluded that use of the \n12  CRA here would be unlawful.  \n13  10.  In fact, the CRA has never before been used in any context that resembles this one.  It \n14  has certainly never been used, as it was here, to negate particular state laws.   \n15  11.  The President, his EPA Administrator, and Congressional leadership took these \n16  unprecedented steps because they saw the CRA as a quick and easy way to “take … down” \n17  California’s regulations.  Times of San Diego, Republicans in Congress Are Preparing to Break \n18  Decades of Precedent to Block Climate Policy (Feb. 27, 2025) (quoting Senator Capito).1  They \n19  appear to have agreed with the argument that the CRA should be used—despite its obvious \n20  inapplicability—because “[w]aivers take years to roll back through the administrative process” \n21  and ”ordinary legislation … would have to overcome the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.”  \n22  Boyden Gray PLLC, Buschbacher, Conde Discuss How to Overturn CA’s EV Mandate in the \n23  Wall Street Journal (Jan. 9, 2025).2 \n24  12.  With every step, the “workings of the National Government” failed to follow the law \n25  and likewise failed to honor the “special restraints on federal power over the States.”  Garcia, 469 \n26  U.S. at 552.  The “extraordinary defects” in the “national political process” that produced these \n27 \n \n1 Available at https://perma.cc/8GQV-LQEN, last visited May 15, 2025. \n28  2 Available at https://perma.cc/D59T-Q7JB, last visited May 17, 2025. \n   3   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 5 of 43\n \n1  Resolutions renders them unlawful and “invalid under the Tenth Amendment” and principles of \n2  structural federalism.  South Carolina, 485 U.S. at 512.  That Congress violated separation of \n3  powers principles along the way only underscores the unconstitutionality of the Resolutions. \n4  13.  This Court should declare that the Resolutions have no effect on the status or \n5  enforceability of state emissions control programs.  This Court should also require EPA to \n6  implement the Clean Air Act, including Section 209(b)(3), 42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(3), in a manner \n7  consistent with the three waivers as granted. \n8  PARTIES \n9  14.

This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (action arising under the \n21  Constitution or laws of the United States).  An actual controversy exists between the parties \n22  within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), and the Court may grant declaratory relief, injunctive \n23  relief, and other relief against Defendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202 and the Court’s \n24  equitable powers. \n25  30.  5 U.S.C. § 805 does not strip this Court of its jurisdiction because (a) Plaintiffs \n26  challenge actions and/or determinations that fall outside the scope of that provision; (b) Plaintiffs \n27  raise constitutional issues to which that provision does not apply; and/or (c) it would be \n28  unconstitutional to apply that provision to Plaintiffs’ claims.  Indeed, this case presents precisely \n   6   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 8 of 43\n \n1  the kinds of “questions of intricacy and nicety” about federalism that the courts alone can resolve.  \n2  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 155 (1992) (quoting The Federalist No. 82, p. 491 (C. \n3  Rossiter ed. 1961)).   \n4  31.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because this is a judicial \n5  district in which the State of California resides for purposes of that provision. \n6  32.  Under Civil Local Rules 3-2(c) and 3-5(b), Plaintiffs allege that there is no basis for \n7  assignment of this action to any particular location or division of this Court. \n8  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n9  I.  Congress Enacted the Clean Air Act Waiver Provision to Allow California’s \nRegulatory Program to Continue with Minimal Federal Oversight \n10 \n33.  From the inception of efforts to limit vehicular air pollution, California led the way.  \n11 \nThe State’s “interest in pollution control from motor vehicles dates to 1946,” MEMA I, 627 F.2d \n12 \nat 1109 n.26, and California’s legislature mandated statewide motor vehicle emission standards \n13 \nbeginning in the 1950s, see 1959 Cal. Stat. 2091.  By contrast, “[n]o federal statute purported to \n14 \nregulate emissions from motor vehicles until 1965.”  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1108; see also Pub. L. \n15 \nNo. 89-272, § 202, 79 Stat. 992 (1965). \n16 \n34.  When Congress took up the mantle of federal vehicle emission regulation, it \n17 \nrecognized both California’s extraordinary air pollution challenges and the value of state-level \n18 \nexperimentation.  Congress therefore opted to allow the State to continue and “improve on ‘its \n19 \nalready excellent program.’”  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1110 (quoting S. Rep. No. 403, 90th Cong., \n20 \n1st Sess. 33 (1967)).  Accordingly, while it preempted other States from regulating emissions \n21 \nfrom new motor vehicles, Congress required EPA to waive that preemption for California except \n22 \nin narrow circumstances.  Pub. L. No. 90-148, § 208(b), 81 Stat. 485, 501 (1967).3  Under this \n23 \nwaiver provision, California promulgates its own standards through a state rulemaking \n24 \nproceeding, determines that its state program is at least as protective as EPA’s, and requests a \n25 \n26 \n \n27  3 The 1967 Act gave this authority to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  In \n1970, Congress transferred this authority to the Administrator of the newly created EPA.  Pub. L. \n28  No. 91-604, § 15(c)(2), 84 Stat. 1676, 1713 (1970). \n   7   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 9 of 43\n \n1  waiver of preemption from EPA.  42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C) \n2  (identifying exclusive findings that can support EPA’s denial of California’s request for waiver). \n3  35.  Consistent with the principle that Congress does not “impose its will on the States … \n4  lightly,” Gregory, 501 U.S. at 460, the questions about whether and how to preempt state \n5  regulation of new motor vehicle emissions were heavily debated.  The precise text of the waiver \n6  provision was the subject of particularly rigorous discussion, with competing versions offered by \n7  the House and Senate.  The Senate version provided that the waiver “shall” be granted (absent \n8  certain limited findings), while the House version made waivers discretionary through the use of \n9  the word “may.”  See 113 Cong. Rec. 30,956-57 (1967); see also id. at 30,950, 30,952.   \n10  36.  The Senate’s use of “shall” was described as a “guarantee[]” that California could \n11  regulate, id. at 30,952, with the “burden … on the [agency] to show why California … should not \n12  be allowed to [do so],” H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 96 (1967).  By contrast, the House’s use of \n13  “may” was characterized as placing California “at the mercy of” the Federal government, forcing \n14  the State “to come with hat in hand to Washington.”  113 Cong. Rec. at 30,941, 30,955; see also \n15  H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 96 (“Are we now to tell California that we don’t quite trust her to run \n16  her own program, that big government should do it instead?”). \n17  37.  Congress opted for “shall,” 42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(1), “consciously choos[ing] to permit \n18  California to blaze its own trail with a minimum of federal oversight,” Ford Motor Co. v. EPA, \n19  606 F.2d 1293, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 1979).4 \n20  38.  The decision to allow California to continue and expand its state-level program \n21  reflected a careful congressional compromise, balancing the benefits—for the State and “the \n22  entire country”—of preserving “a kind of laboratory for innovation,” Engine Mfrs. Ass’n v. EPA, \n23  88 F.3d 1075, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1996), against automakers’ fears of “having to meet fifty-one \n24  separate sets of emissions control requirements,” MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1109-10.  This \n25  compromise ensured that California’s “government will represent and remain accountable to its \n26  own citizens,” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 920 (1997), while also ensuring \n27 \n \n4 In the 1970 CAA amendments, the waiver provision (originally Section 208(b)) was \n28  recodified as Section 209(b), 42 U.S.C. § 7543(b).  Pub. L. No. 91-604, § 8(a), 84 Stat. at 1694. \n   8   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 10 of 43\n \n1  manufacturers must meet no more than two different sets of emission standards—California’s \n2  state standards and EPA’s federal ones.  And, as intended, this compromise has allowed \n3  California to continue addressing the “harsh reality” of the State’s pollution problems using its \n4  expertise in regulating vehicular emissions.  See H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 96-97 (1967); see also \n5  S. Rep. No. 90-403, at 33 (1967).   \n6  39.  As part of the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments, Congress noted with approval that \n7  EPA had been readily granting waivers to California, consistent with Congress’s intent.  H.R. \n8  Rep. No. 94-1175 at 247 (1976); see also MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1110 n.32.  Congress nonetheless \n9  sought to “ratify and strengthen” the waiver provision in order “to afford California the broadest \n10  possible discretion in selecting the best means to protect the health of its citizens and the public \n11  welfare.”  H.R. Rep. No. 95-294, at 301-02 (1977).  Specifically, Congress amended the waiver \n12  provision’s text, removing the original requirement that each California standard be more \n13  stringent than its federal counterpart and allowing the protectiveness of the state’s program to be \n14  measured by viewing all the “state standards, in the aggregate.”  42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(1). \n15  40.  Congress also opted to permit other States to choose to adopt “standards … identical \n16  to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted” under certain conditions, 42 \n17  U.S.C. § 7507, thereby respecting state authority to protect residents and natural resources while \n18  maintaining the commitment that manufacturers would be subject to no more than two sets of \n19  standards. \n20  41.  EPA has granted California more than seventy-five Clean Air Act preemption \n21  waivers as the State has expanded and strengthened its requirements that manufacturers reduce \n22  emissions from the vehicles they sell in the State.  See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California \n23  Waivers and Authorizations.5  EPA has granted such waivers under Democratic and Republican \n24  Presidents alike.  See id.  And these waivers are—and have been—subject to judicial review in \n25  the appropriate Court of Appeals.  42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1). \n26  42.  Among these previously granted waivers are those for California’s zero-emission-\n27  vehicle (ZEV) requirements for passenger cars and light trucks.  58 Fed.

Reg. 78,190 (Dec. 28, 2006); 78 Fed. Reg. 2112 (Jan. 9, 2013).6  The State first \n2  adopted such requirements in 1990, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, § 1960.1(g)(2) (1991), and has made \n3  them increasingly more stringent over time.   \n4  43.  One of the three waivers at issue here authorized the Advanced Clean Cars II \n5  regulation which extended and gradually strengthened California’s ZEV requirements for \n6  passenger cars and light trucks such that, by model year 2035, at least 80% of such vehicles sold \n7  in California would be zero-emission, while the other 20% could be plug-in hybrids.  Cal. Code \n8  Regs., tit. 13, § 1962.4(c), (e)(1)(C).  That regulation also strengthened several emission \n9  standards for vehicles with internal combustion engines, requiring reduced emissions of fine \n10  particulate matter and smog-forming oxides of nitrogen.  Id. § 1961.4. \n11  44.  Another of the waivers at issue here authorized, inter alia, the Advanced Clean \n12  Trucks regulation—designed to build on the success of the California ZEV requirements \n13  described above by requiring gradual increases in sales of medium- and heavy-duty ZEVs \n14  beginning with model year 2024.  Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, § 1963.1(b).  This regulation was \n15  adopted in 2021, and manufacturers began earning early credits for ZEV sales that year.  CARB, \n16  Advanced Clean Trucks Credits Summary as of March 31, 2022.7  Indeed, manufacturers \n17  “generated enough credits to meet the estimated 2024 model year compliance obligations” before \n18  that model year even commenced.  CARB, Advanced Clean Trucks Credit Summary through the \n19  2023 Model Year (May 22, 2024).8  \n20  45.  The third of the waivers at issue here authorized California’s “Omnibus” regulation \n21  which requires manufacturers of heavy-duty (mostly diesel-fueled) trucks to reduce smog-\n22  forming emissions beginning with model year 2024 and then further reduce those emissions in \n23  model year 2027 and beyond.  Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, § 1956.8. \n24  46.

All of these regulations apply only in California and other States that have chosen to \n7  adopt one or more of the regulations, pursuant to the option provided by Congress in the Clean \n8  Air Act.  See 42. U.S.C. § 7507. \n9  II.  Congress Enacted the Congressional Review Act to Enhance Its Oversight of \nGenerally Applicable Federal Rules and, Prior to these Resolutions, Has Only \n10  Used It for that Purpose \n11  48.  When Republicans took control of both chambers of Congress after the 1994 midterm \n12  elections, they credited their election victory to the “Contract with America,” which contained a \n13  promise to push for federal regulatory reform, including shrinking the size of the federal \n14  government.  See S. Rep. 104-15, at 3 (Mar. 16, 1995) (describing 1994 elections as sending “a \n15  clear message to Washington that [Americans] want a smaller, more efficient, and more effective \n16  government”).   \n17  49.  Once in office, the Republican majority in the House attempted to impose a \n18  moratorium on all new federal regulations “to ensure economy and efficiency of Federal \n19  Government Operations.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-39, at 1 (Feb. 16, 1995).  That effort failed.   \n20  50.  The push for federal regulatory reform then evolved into what became known as the \n21  Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act and the CRA, both of which were \n22  incorporated into a broader, bipartisan bill:  the Contract with America Advancement Act of \n23  1996.  Pub. L. 104-121, 110 Stat. 847 (Mar. 29, 1996).  That Act also contained an increase to the \n24  Nation’s debt limit and an increase to the limit on income Social Security recipients may earn \n25  without losing benefits.  110 Stat. at 847, 875.

The House bill then passed, without amendment, by unanimous consent in the \n2  Senate.  142 Cong. Rec. S3114 (Mar. 28, 1996).   \n3  51.  The CRA requires a “Federal agency” that has promulgated a “rule” to submit the \n4  rule, along with its “proposed effective date” and other information, to Congress and the \n5  Government Accountability Office (GAO) “[b]efore a rule can take effect.”  5 U.S.C. \n6  § 801(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).   \n7  52.  Underscoring that it applies only to federal rules, the CRA defines the federal agency \n8  actions to which it applies by way of the federal Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) definition \n9  of “rule.”  5 U.S.C. § 804(3) (cross-referencing 5 U.S.C. § 551).  The CRA then narrows the APA \n10  definition by, among other things, excluding “any rule of particular applicability.”  Id. \n11  53.  Congress has 60 session days from the agency’s submission to adopt a resolution to \n12  disapprove a particular rule.  5 U.S.C. § 802(a).  The text of such resolutions is prescribed by the \n13  statute as follows:  “That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the __ relating to __, and \n14  such rule shall have no force or effect.”  Id.  The first blank is filled in with the agency’s name \n15  and the second is typically filled in with the title of the Federal Register notice announcing the \n16  final rule.  E.g., H.J. Res. 35 (approved Mar. 14, 2025).  After a joint resolution of disapproval, “a \n17  new rule that is substantially the same … may not be issued, unless [it] is specifically authorized \n18  by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.”  5 U.S.C. \n19  § 801(b)(2). \n20  54.  If an agency fails to submit an action that one or more members of Congress believe \n21  is a “rule” subject to the CRA, those members may ask the GAO for a determination.  \n22  Congressional Research Service, The Congressional Review Act: Determining Which “Rules” \n23  Must Be Submitted to Congress 23 (updated Oct. 22, 2024).11  In that case, if the GAO concludes \n24  the agency action is or is not subject to the CRA, Congress treats that conclusion as dispositive.  \n25  Id.  (“Thus, the question of whether Congress may use the CRA’s fast-track parliamentary \n26 \n27 \n \n11 Available at The Congressional Review Act: Determining Which “Rules” Must Be \n28  Submitted to Congress | Congress.gov | Library of Congress, last visited May 21, 2025. \n   12   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 14 of 43\n \n1  disapproval mechanism generally hinges upon the determination reached in GAO’s opinion in \n2  such cases.”). \n3  55.  In the Senate, the consideration of CRA resolutions is highly expedited.  The CRA \n4  creates an exception to the filibuster, so that resolutions of disapproval require only a simple \n5  majority to pass.  5 U.S.C. § 802(d)(1).  And motions, amendments, and even debate are all \n6  severely limited.  Id. §§ 802(d)(1), 802(d)(2).  Specifically, debate about the resolution and any \n7  “debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 \n8  hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the joint \n9  resolution.”  Id. § 802(d)(2).  Although other motions are not “in order” and thus not permitted, \n10  “[a] motion further to limit debate”—to less than 10 hours—“is in order and not debatable.”  Id.   \n11  56.  The CRA also provides that “no determination, finding, action, or omission under [it] \n12  shall be subject to judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. § 805. \n13  57.  Nothing in the CRA—or the broader Contract with America Advancement Act of \n14  1996—indicates Congress was contemplating the use of the CRA to negate state rules or to \n15  otherwise alter federal limits on state authority.  To the contrary, the text of the CRA is \n16  exclusively concerned with federal rules promulgated by federal agencies.  E.g., 5 U.S.C. \n17  § 801(a)(1)(B) (referring to “the Federal agency promulgating the rule”).  So, too, were other \n18  parts of the broader bill that contained the CRA.  E.g., Pub. L. 104-121, 110 Stat. at 857 \n19  (“fundamental changes … are needed in the regulatory and enforcement culture of Federal \n20  agencies”). \n21  58.  The absence of any mention of state rules or state authority is particularly telling \n22  because Congress does not lightly exercise its power to “impose its will on the States.”  Gregory, \n23  501 U.S. at 460.  Many features of the CRA—including its constraints on debate and its barriers \n24  to judicial review—are entirely inconsistent with that principle.  \n25  59.  Moreover, the Framers intended “[t]he difficulty of legislating at the federal level … \n26  to preserve room for lawmaking by governments” like States, which are “more local and more \n27  accountable than a distant federal authority.”  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 739 (2022) \n28  (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  As the 1967 debate over the Clean Air Act’s preemption and waiver \n   13   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 15 of 43\n \n1  provisions indicate, had Congress contemplated that the CRA could be used to hamstring state \n2  authority, that would have been the topic of fierce debate.   \n3  60.  Until these Resolutions, Congress had never applied the CRA to an agency action \n4  outside the statute’s intended and explicit scope.   \n5  61.  Specifically, no previous use of the CRA disapproved of a federal agency action that \n6  waived preemption or otherwise authorized States to proceed with their own regulatory programs.  \n7  Congress has never, for example, even considered using the CRA to disapprove EPA’s actions to \n8  authorize States to implement permitting programs under the Clean Water Act—even when EPA \n9  has “rush[ed] to transfer this permitting authority to [a State] in the final days” of a presidential \n10  administration.  See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Regan, 734 F. Supp. 3d 1, 11 (D.D.C.), \n11  judgment entered, 729 F. Supp. 3d 37 (D.D.C. 2024) (appeal pending).  Congress has likewise \n12  never even considered using the CRA to disapprove of waivers that allow individual States “to \n13  test new or existing ways to deliver and pay for health care services in Medicaid and the \n14  Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).”  See Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \n15  State Waivers List.12 \n16  62.  Likewise, Congress has never considered using the CRA to disapprove federal agency \n17  orders that, like these preemption waivers, permit conduct that would otherwise be prohibited.  \n18  For example, Congress has never considered using the CRA to disapprove of a radio spectrum \n19  license, mining permit, or oil lease.   \n20  III.  For Half a Century, and Regardless of Which Party Occupied the White House, \nClean Air Act Preemption Waivers Have Been Understood to Be Adjudicatory \n21  Orders, Not Rules  \n22  63.  The text of the Clean Air Act demonstrates that Congress has always understood the \n23  difference between federal vehicle emission standards (which are federal rules) and decisions to \n24  waive preemption for state vehicle emission standards (which are not).  Where Congress \n25  delegated rulemaking power over vehicle emissions to EPA, it directed the agency to \n26  “prescribe … standards,” 42 U.S.C. § 7521(a)(1), consistent with the APA’s definition of rules as \n27 \n \n12 Available at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section-1115-demo/demonstration-\n28  and-waiver-list, last visited May 8, 2025. \n   14   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 16 of 43\n \n1  “prescrib[ing] law,” 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).  By contrast, Congress “sharply restricted [EPA’s] role in \n2  a waiver proceeding.”  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1121.  Far from delegating rulemaking authority to \n3  EPA, the waiver provision anticipates that California will prescribe “State standards” and \n4  determine whether its standards “will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective” as EPA’s.  42 \n5  U.S.C. § 7543(b)(1).  Thus, the waiver provision only empowers EPA to “waive application” of \n6  the preemption provision to California, not to make rules.  Id.   \n7  64.  Congress confirmed as much when it omitted waiver decisions from the list of EPA \n8  Clean Air Act actions to which the Act’s “[r]ulemaking” requirements apply.  42 U.S.C. \n9  § 7607(d)(1). \n10  65.  Until its post-hoc actions challenged here, EPA had likewise consistently maintained \n11  that its waiver decisions are not rules and therefore are not subject to a host of requirements that \n12  apply only to rules—including Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. \n13  § 601(2)), and the CRA.  This had been EPA’s position through Administrations of both parties, \n14  regardless of whether EPA granted a waiver request or denied it.  Thus, EPA’s waiver decisions \n15  have consistently specified “this action is not a rule.”  75 Fed. Reg. 70,237, 70,241 (Nov. 17, \n16  2010); see also, e.g., 69 Fed. Reg. 59,920, 59,922 (Oct. 6, 2004) (“The CRA does not apply … \n17  because this action is not a rule.”); 73 Fed. Reg. 12,156, 12,169 (Mar. 6, 2008) (“As with past \n18  waiver decisions, this action is not a rule….”).  EPA maintained this position when the first \n19  Trump Administration purported to withdraw parts of a waiver EPA had granted six years earlier.  \n20  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,352 (Sept. 27, 2019) (“EPA’s action here … is not a rule ..., consistent \n21  with its previous actions on waiver requests….”).13 \n22  66.  The GAO—the entity on which Congress relies for CRA applicability \n23  determinations—has agreed.  When asked by members of Congress whether a 2022 waiver action \n24  was a “rule” subject to the CRA, the GAO concluded that the action “meets the statutory \n25  definition of an order,” rather than a rule.  GAO Decision B-334309, Environmental Protection \n \n26  13 This Federal Register notice was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget \nunder Executive Order 12866, and to Congress and the GAO for CRA consideration, because it \n27  contained a separate action by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that was a \n“rule.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 51,352, 51,353.  By contrast, EPA repeatedly reaffirmed its position that \n28  the waiver portion of the notice was not a rule.  Id. at 51,352, 51,353, 51,360. \n   15   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 17 of 43\n \n1  Agency—Applicability of the Congressional Review Act to Notice of Decision on Clean Air Act \n2  Waiver of Preemption 5 (Nov. 30, 2023) (Exh. A).  Specifically, the GAO determined that a \n3  waiver decision “mak[es] a ‘final disposition’ granting California a ‘form of permission’ which \n4  meets the definition of order under APA.”  Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(6), (8), (9)).  \n5  67.  Members of both the Senate and the House also indicated—as recently as last year—\n6  that they understood that EPA’s preemption waiver decisions are not rules.  When he introduced a \n7  bill to repeal the Clean Air Act’s waiver provision, in September 2024, Senator Mike Lee \n8  expressly acknowledged that Clean Air Act preemption waivers “cannot be reviewed under the \n9  Congressional Review Act (CRA)” because they are not “rule[s] as that term is defined in the \n10  CRA.”  Mike Lee, Stop CARB Act One Pager (118th Congress) (emphasis omitted).14  That \n11  bill—S.5038, 118th Cong. (2024)—had five co-sponsors in the Senate.15  Representative Troy \n12  Nehls likewise acknowledged that “none of [California’s waivers] are subject to congressional \n13  review” when he introduced the companion bill in the House.  Rep. Troy Nehls Introduces the \n14  Stop CARB Act (Sept. 12, 2024).16  That bill—H.R. 9574, 118th Cong. (2024)—had nine co-\n15  sponsors in the House.17 \n16  68.  Consistent with those understandings (including its own longstanding view), EPA did \n17  not follow rulemaking procedures when considering these California waiver requests.  It did not, \n18  for example, issue a proposed rule, or even a proposed disposition of California’s request, when it \n19  solicited public comment.  Instead, EPA followed its traditional practice, providing notice to the \n20  public that it had received a waiver request from California and would provide “opportunity for \n21  public hearing and comment” on the three findings the waiver provision empowers EPA to make.  \n22  E.g., 88 Fed. Reg. 88,908, 88,909 (Dec. 26, 2023).   \n23  69.  When it finalized the waiver decisions at issue here, EPA reiterated its longstanding \n24  position that “the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., … does not apply because this \n25 \n26 \n \n14 Available at https://perma.cc/LNG5-45AW, last visited May 4, 2025. \n27  15 See https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5038/cosponsors. \n16 Available at https://perma.cc/55TB-737M, last visited May 4, 2025.  \n28  17 See https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9574/cosponsors. \n   16   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 18 of 43\n \n1  action is not a rule, for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 804(3).”  E.g., 88 Fed. Reg. 20,688, 20,726 (Apr. 6, \n2  2023). \n3  70.  EPA did not submit these waivers to Congress when they were published in the \n4  Federal Register—one in April 2023 and two in January 2025.  Any member of Congress could \n5  have asked the GAO to determine whether these unsubmitted actions were rules subject to the \n6  CRA.  No member of Congress did so.  \n7  IV.  The Trump Administration Implements a CRA Playbook, Without Providing \nAny Legal Rationale and Without Any Administrative Process \n8 \n71.  President Trump took aim at parts of California’s vehicle emission program, from the \n9 \nvery beginning of his second term.  He signed a day-one Executive Order that declared “state \n10 \nemissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles” should be \n11 \n“terminat[ed].”18   \n12 \n72.  That Executive Order directed federal agencies (including EPA) to “identify … \n13 \nagency actions … inconsistent with” the Order and to “develop and begin implementing action \n14 \nplans to suspend, revise, or rescind all [such] agency actions.”  Id.  Thus, at the outset, it appeared \n15 \nthat the Trump Administration intended to take administrative action to rescind certain waivers \n16 \n(or parts thereof), as the first Trump Administration had done.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 (Sept. 27, \n17 \n2019) (“EPA announces its decision to withdraw the waiver” for certain California emission \n18 \nstandards).  \n19 \n73.  The Administration changed course on February 14, 2025, when President Trump and \n20 \nEPA Administrator Zeldin “announced in the Oval Office … that the EPA [would] transmit[] to \n21 \nCongress,” for CRA consideration, the three waiver decisions at issue.19  In so doing, the \n22 \nPresident and EPA Administrator appeared to be following a playbook as to “how the incoming \n23 \nTrump administration” could use the CRA to “stop” the State’s efforts to reduce vehicular \n24 \npollution, without following “the administrative process” which could “take years” and without \n25 \n \n26  18 Unleashing American Energy Executive Order (Jan. 20, 2025), available at \nhttps://perma.cc/33NL-LQKE, last visited May 5, 2025.  \n27  19 EPA, Trump EPA to Transmit California Waivers to Congress in Accordance with \nStatutory Reporting Requirement (Feb. 14, 2025), available at https://perma.cc/GDF5-HVM2, last \n28  visited May 5, 2025.  \n   17   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 19 of 43\n \n1  employing “ordinary legislation [which] would have to overcome the 60-vote filibuster in the \n2  Senate.”  See supra n.2. \n3  74.  The Administration’s announcement provided no explanation for EPA’s about-face \n4  from its longstanding prior position that waiver decisions are not rules, much less rules of general \n5  applicability subject to the CRA.  See supra n.19.  Indeed, the announcement did not even \n6  acknowledge that EPA had always treated waiver decisions as adjudicatory orders, including in \n7  the very actions at issue.  See id.  Nor did EPA provide any public process leading up to the \n8  announcement of the purported reclassification of these waivers from orders to rules.   \n9  75.  The Administration’s announcement likewise did not explain how the submission of \n10  these waiver decisions was consistent with the CRA, given that all of the waivers had already \n11  “take[n] effect” and one of the waivers had been published in the Federal Register almost two \n12  years earlier.  See 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A). \n13  76.  Nonetheless, some members of Congress indicated they, too, were prepared to follow \n14  the CRA playbook (again without establishing the statute’s applicability), responding to the \n15  Administration’s announcement by asserting that “the Trump EPA’s” submission of “these \n16  waivers, [would give] Congress the opportunity to reject California’s effort to impose its EV \n17  mandate on all Americans.”20  The only “rules” referenced were California’s state rules, not \n18  federal ones, and these statements failed to acknowledge that California’s regulations only apply \n19  in California (and other States that so choose), much less to accurately describe California’s \n20  regulations, including the many provisions that require reduced emissions from gasoline- or \n21  diesel-fueled vehicles. \n22  77.  EPA then submitted the three waivers at issue to the GAO and Congress on February \n23  19, 2025.  See GAO Letter B-337179, Observations Regarding the Environmental Protection \n24  Agency’s Submission of Notices of Decision on Clean Air Act Preemption Waivers as Rules \n25  Under the Congressional Review Act 1 & n.1 (March 6, 2025) (Exh. B).

See supra n.19.   \n3  V.  The GAO Determines (Again) that Waiver Decisions Are Not Subject to the \nCRA \n4 \n78.  Upon receipt of EPA’s submission, the GAO observed that the waiver “notices \n5 \nthemselves stated that CRA did not apply” and that EPA had not explained “why the agency was \n6 \nsubmitting the notices under the CRA.”  Exh. B at 2, 6.  In fact, EPA’s February 19 submission \n7 \ndescribed the waiver decisions as “actions” and “Notice[s] of Decisions,” rather than rules.  The \n8 \nGAO thus “reached out to EPA on February 20, 2025, for clarification.”  Id. at 2. \n9 \n79.  On February 21, 2025, three Senators—including both Senators from California—\n10 \nrequested that the GAO provide its legal opinion about whether these three waivers were rules \n11 \nsubject to the CRA.  See id. at 1.   \n12 \n80.  On February, 25, 2025, the GAO followed up on its initial outreach to EPA, sending \n13 \n“a formal letter  … seeking factual information and the agency’s legal views on this matter.”  Id. \n14 \nat 2.  EPA “resubmitted the Notices of Decision to GAO on February 27, 2025” but “still did not \n15 \naddress the statements in the notices regarding the inapplicability of the CRA.”  Id.   \n16 \n81.  Some members of Congress welcomed EPA’s submission but, like EPA, failed to \n17 \narticulate a legal basis for treating waiver decisions as rules.  Rather, they asserted that the \n18 \nagency’s submission—by itself—could transform into rules these actions that had been \n19 \nconsidered and finalized by EPA as orders:  “Once they submitted it to us, it’s a rule. … [And] \n20 \nwe can take it down.”  Times of San Diego, Republicans in Congress Are Preparing to Break \n21 \nDecades of Precedent to Block Climate Policy (Feb. 27, 2025) (quoting Senator Capito).21 \n22 \n82.  On March 5, 2025, EPA submitted a revised version of its report to Congress.  In this \n23 \nversion, EPA altered the labels it applied to the waiver decisions, referring to them as “final \n24 \nrules,” instead of “actions” or “Notice[s] of Decision” as in the initial February 19 report.  EPA \n25 \nstill provided no explanation for the change. \n26 \n27 \n \n28  21 Available at https://perma.cc/9VHE-RTB4, last visited May 11, 2025. \n   19   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 21 of 43\n \n1  83.  On March 6, 2025, the GAO issued its legal analysis, concluding (as before) that \n2  waiver actions are not subject to the CRA.  Exh. B at 9.  Again, the GAO concluded that these \n3  three waiver decisions meet “the APA definition of an order,” not of a rule, because they make \n4  preemption determinations—i.e., “‘final disposition[s]’ granting California a ‘form of permission’ \n5  as described in the APA definition” of “order.”  Id. at 6 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 551(6)). \n6  84.  The GAO also reiterated its prior conclusion that, even if waiver decisions were rules, \n7  they would still not be subject to the CRA because they are not rules of general applicability.  \n8  Instead, the GAO concluded, waiver decisions “concern[] a specific entity—California—and \n9  address[] a statutory waiver specific to California’s [program].”  Id. \n10  VI.  Congressional Leadership Considers Moving Forward with the Resolutions, \nDespite GAO’s Determination that the CRA Was Inapplicable \n11 \n85.  About a month later, and despite the GAO’s reaffirmation that the CRA does not \n12 \napply to Clean Air Act preemption waivers, members of the House introduced the Resolutions—\n13 \neach targeting one of the three preemption waivers at issue.  H.J. Res. 87, 88, 89 (introduced \n14 \nApril 2, 2025). \n15 \n86.  Some Senate leaders also signaled an interest in disregarding the GAO’s \n16 \ndetermination.  For example, Senator Capito—Chairman of the Senate Committee on \n17 \nEnvironment and Public Works—responded to the GAO’s determination by stating “that these \n18 \nwaivers are rules, and subject to a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review \n19 \nAct.”  Alex Nieves, There’s hope for the waivers still (Mar. 20, 2025).22   \n20 \n87.  No legal justification for using the CRA was provided, however.  No public \n21 \nstatements identified any errors in the GAO’s reasoning or otherwise articulated a legal rationale \n22 \nfor concluding that these waivers fit the statutory definition of a rule (or were generally \n23 \napplicable). \n24 \n88.  Meanwhile, industry advocates—including those who first publicized the CRA \n25 \nplaybook—maintained that the GAO’s determination and, indeed, the statutory definition of \n26 \n“rule,” were all irrelevant.  Buschbacher & Conde, Congress Has the Authority to Review EPA \n27 \n \n22 Available at https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-climate/2025/03/20/theres-\n28  hope-for-the-waivers-still-00242123, last visited May 11, 2025. \n   20   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 22 of 43\n \n1  “Waivers” of Clean Air Act Preemption, Yale J. Reg. (Mar. 5, 2025) (arguing “that the CRA’s \n2  text … do[es] not bind”).23  Under that view, the only thing that mattered was EPA’s submission \n3  of the waiver decisions to Congress because “the CRA gives Congress unchallengeable power to \n4  invalidate any action that an agency submits for review.”  Id.  \n5  VII.  The Senate Parliamentarian Also Concludes that these Waiver Decisions Are \nNot Properly Subject to the CRA  \n6 \n89.  The question of the CRA’s applicability was then presented to the Senate \n7 \nParliamentarian, “the sole definitive arbiter[] of the CRA parliamentary mechanism” in that \n8 \nchamber.  Congressional Research Service, The Congressional Review Act (CRA):  Frequently \n9 \nAsked Questions, 18 (Updated Nov. 12, 2021);24 see also Jonathan S. Gould, Law Within \n10 \nCongress, 129 Yale L. J. 1946, 1959 (2020) (“The parliamentarians are the primary interpreters \n11 \nof the rules governing Congress.”). \n12 \n90.  After hearing arguments on both sides, the Senate Parliamentarian agreed with the \n13 \nGAO that waiver decisions are not subject to the CRA.  Although her decision was not made \n14 \npublic, it was widely reported as occurring on April 4, 2025.  Lisa Friedman, Republican Plan to \n15 \nKill California’s E.V. Policies Hits Senate Snag (April 4, 2025).25 \n16 \n91.  That should have been the end of it because “in the ordinary course of business, \n17 \nCongress’s procedural rules—and the parliamentarians’ interpretations of those rules—are as \n18 \ngood as binding.”  Law Within Congress at 1958.  Senate Majority Leader John Thune had agreed \n19 \nas recently as January 2025, responding to questions about possibly overriding the Senate \n20 \nParliamentarian with “[w]e can’t go there.”  Russell Payne, The Senate parliamentarian could \n21 \nblock some of Trump’s agenda — and be a scapegoat for Republicans (January 9, 2025).26  \n22 \n92.  But some members of Congress remained intent on using the CRA to invalidate these \n23 \nthree waivers.  Indeed, some immediately started “weighing whether to defy the parliamentarian \n24 \n[in order to] to reject California’s plans….”  Kelsey Brugger, Senators weigh next moves on \n25 \n \n23 Available at https://perma.cc/C8V5-9KFY, last visited May 11, 2025. \n26  24 Available at https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R43992, last visited May 21, 2025. \n25 Available at https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/climate/california-ev-waiver-\n27  senate.html, last visited May 22, 2025; see also https://perma.cc/A47L-KQEJ, last visited May \n21, 2025. \n28  26 Available at https://perma.cc/B8K5-CLCZ, last visited May 10, 2025. \n   21   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 23 of 43\n \n1  California clean car rules (April 10, 2025).27  The attack continued to focus on the parts of \n2  California’s program that allegedly “ban gas-powered cars and trucks,” again failing to \n3  acknowledge that other parts of the state program were authorized by these waivers.  See supra \n4  n.26. \n5  VIII. Congress Adopts the Resolutions, Flouting the GAO and Parliamentarian’s \nRulings \n6 \n93.  Despite the GAO and Senate Parliamentarian determinations, House members \n7 \nproceeded to introduce the Resolutions targeting the three California waivers at issue.  Kelsey \n8 \nBrugger, House plows ahead with assault on California EPA waivers (Apr. 4, 2025).28  The \n9 \npublic statements around this action again failed to address the fact that state emission regulations \n10 \nonly apply in States that have chosen to adopt them.  Id. (“The American people should choose \n11 \nwhat vehicle is right for them, not California bureaucrats.”).  These statements likewise failed to \n12 \nreconcile claims about the impacts of these waivers with EPA’s position—in the very reports it \n13 \nsubmitted to Congress—that these were not “major rules,” meaning EPA did not expect these \n14 \nwaiver decisions to cause “major increase[s] in costs or prices for consumers, individual \n15 \nindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions” or “significant \n16 \nadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, [or] innovation.”  See 5 \n17 \nU.S.C. § 804(2).  \n18 \n94.  The only explanation provided by House members for departing from the practice \n19 \nthat “the GAO … has historically decided what can be considered a rule under the CRA” was the \n20 \nfact that EPA submitted the waivers to Congress.  Id. (“‘By submitting the three California \n21 \nwaivers to Congress, Administrator Zeldin is ensuring that Congress has oversight of these major \n22 \nrules that impact every American,’ [Energy and Commerce Chair] Guthrie said.”); see also \n23 \nChairman Guthrie, Vice Chairman Joyce, and Energy and Commerce Republicans Introduce \n24 \nLegislation to Stop California EV Mandates.29 \n25 \n26 \n \n27  27 Available at https://perma.cc/SX9T-AAQK, last visited May 11, 2025. \n28 Available at https://perma.cc/AD9Z-P7W7, last visited May 11, 2025. \n28  29 Available at https://perma.cc/3UAM-QWWL, last visited May 21, 2025. \n   22   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 24 of 43\n \n1  95.  The House later voted to adopt all three Resolutions, targeting the Advanced Clean \n2  Trucks and Omnibus waivers on April 30, 2025, and the Advanced Clean Cars II waiver on May \n3  1, 2025.  Camila Domonoske, The House Strikes a Blow Against California in the Fight over EVs \n4  (May 1, 2025).30 \n5  96.  No member or committee of the House provided any legal rationale for concluding \n6  that waiver decisions are federal agency rules of general applicability that could be subject to the \n7  CRA.  Nor did any members of the House who had previously expressed the opposite view \n8  explain their change of position.  Instead, after the House votes, the sponsors of the Resolutions \n9  continued to attribute Congress’s ability to use the CRA here solely to the actions of the \n10  Executive Branch.  E.g., Congressmen Brett Guthrie, John Joyce, John James, and Jay Obernolte, \n11  How Congress Is Fighting Biden’s Disastrous EV Mandate (May 2, 2025).31 \n12  97.  At least one press outlet described the House’s decision to “hold[] the votes \n13  anyway”—despite the GAO and Senate Parliamentarian determinations—as “demonstrating that \n14  they are willing to carry out their agenda regardless of whether the nonpartisan arbiter deems \n15  them legal.”  Rachel Frazin, House votes to overturn California gas car ban — again defying \n16  internal watchdog.32 \n17  98.  Leaders in the Senate also ultimately decided to proceed with votes on the \n18  Resolutions, disregarding GAO’s legal conclusion and overriding the Senate Parliamentarian’s \n19  determination that the CRA was inapplicable.  E&E News, Senate GOP Plots Demise of \n20  California Clean Car Rules (May 20, 2025).33  Yet again, the announcements provided no basis \n21  for any disagreement with the GAO and Parliamentarian’s legal conclusions. \n22  99.  In justifying the decision to “defy the chamber’s parliamentarian,” Senate Majority \n23  Leader Thune asserted that “‘widespread effects’” make preemption waivers rules, without \n24  reference to the definition of a rule, without acknowledging that any “widespread effects” result \n25  from choices by state governments, and without explaining how waiver decisions do anything \n26 \n \n30 Available at https://perma.cc/63NY-2KR9, last visited May 21, 2025. \n27  31 Available at https://perma.cc/DUL5-3VQS, last visited May 21, 2025. \n32 Available at https://perma.cc/W7UY-CLGA, last visited May 11, 2025. \n28  33 Available at https://perma.cc/PKF2-4386, last visited May 22, 2025. \n   23   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 25 of 43\n \n1  other than dispose of a request from California.  Id.  Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso \n2  likewise focused on alleged nationwide effects (and ignored the conventional vehicle provisions \n3  of these state regulations), claiming California’s laws would somehow “force-feed electric \n4  vehicles to every man and woman who drives in this country.”  Id. \n5  100.  When Senate Majority Leader Thune announced that he would override the \n6  Parliamentarian’s decision and proceed with the Resolutions, he did not explain how the Senate \n7  would do so, underscoring the unprecedented nature of this step.  See id. (“It’s a little early to \n8  sketch and lay that out.  But we have a process.  We’re moving forward.”). \n9  101.  The process to end-run the Parliamentarian became clear two days later when—on an \n10  unrelated CRA resolution concerning a Department of Transportation (DOT) safety rule—Senate \n11  Majority Leader Thune introduced a point of order for the Senate to determine “that points of \n12  order are in order under the Congressional Review Act given sections 802(d)(1), 802(d)(2), and \n13  802(d)(4) are in conflict with one another.”34  That point of order was agreed to by a vote of 51 to \n14  46.   \n15  102.  Notably, section 802(d)(1) provides that “all points of order against the joint \n16  resolution (and against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived,” meaning no such points \n17  of order are permitted as to CRA resolutions.  5 U.S.C. § 802(d)(1).  The passage of Senator \n18  Thune’s point of order purported to change that and make any point of order permissible. \n19  103.  That change was necessary only to allow Senate Majority Leader Thune to introduce \n20  a second point of order—one that would presumably have been impermissible without approval \n21  of the first.  This second point of order sought to establish that “Joint Resolutions that meet all the \n22  requirements of Section 802 of the Congressional Review Act [are] entitled to expedited \n23  procedures under the Congressional Review Act.”  See supra n.34 (“Recent Floor Activity”).  \n24 \n \n34 See Recent Floor Activity, May 21, 2025, available at https://perma.cc/4RK3-L4ZU, \n25  last visited May 23, 2025.  “Points of order” are the mechanism by which “Senators may enforce \nthe Senate’s legislative rules and precedents.”  Congressional Research Service, Points of Order, \n26  Rulings, and Appeals in the Senate 1 (updated Nov. 15, 2018), available at Points of Order, \nRulings, and Appeals in the Senate | Congress.gov | Library of Congress, last visited June 8, \n27  2025.  When a member “believe[s] that one of those rules or precedents is, or is about to be, \nviolated,” they introduce a point of order to obtain a decision whether or not the action of another \n28  member would violate or have violated the Senate’s internal rules.  Id. \n   24   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 26 of 43\n \n1  Under this second point of order, the Senate could proceed to consider and vote on joint \n2  resolutions so long as a federal agency had submitted a report to Congress declaring that its action \n3  was a “rule,” regardless of whether the GAO and Senate Parliamentarian had concluded \n4  otherwise.  In other words, the purpose of Majority Leader Thune’s second point of order was to \n5  change the trigger for the Senate’s CRA procedures so that agency submission alone sufficed, \n6  effectively rendering the statutory definition of “rule”—and any Senate Parliamentarian \n7  determinations concerning applicability of that definition—irrelevant.   \n8  104.  As Senator Whitehouse, the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public \n9  Works Committee, noted “[t]he purpose” of these points of order was to “allow[] a bypass of the \n10  Parliamentarian’s decision” that it was unlawful to apply the CRA to Clean Air Act preemption \n11  waivers because they are not rules subject to the CRA.  117 Cong. Rec. S3025 (May 21, 2025) \n12  (Exh. C).   \n13  105.  Indeed, these points of order had no other purpose—and seemingly no other effect—\n14  other than to evade the CRA’s express limitations that make it applicable only to certain federal \n15  rules.  Neither point of order was necessary for the proceeding into which the points of order were \n16  introduced—the proceeding concerning the DOT CRA resolution.  In other words, the Senate \n17  Majority Leader introduced impermissible and entirely unnecessary points of order into the \n18  Senate’s consideration of the DOT CRA resolution solely to enable the Senate to later vote on the \n19  EPA waiver Resolutions without having to directly address the Parliamentarian’s contrary \n20  determination.  \n21  106.  The Presiding Officer—Senator Capito—confirmed the point when the Senate \n22  proceeded to consider the Resolutions concerning the preemption waivers.  She explicitly stated \n23  that the Senate could only do so “[p]ursuant to the precedent just established by the Senate”—i.e., \n24  the second point of order just approved during proceedings concerning the DOT resolution.  117 \n25  Cong. Rec. S3052 (May 21, 2025) (Exh. C).  \n26  107.  Those in favor of the Resolutions continued to mischaracterize California’s \n27  regulations and the waivers that authorized them.  For example, Senate Majority Whip Barrasso \n28  asserted that “the Biden administration gave California—the liberal State of California—\n   25   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 27 of 43\n \n1  permission to export its far-left electric vehicle mandate to the entire country.”  117 Cong. Rec. \n2  S3017 (May 21, 2025) (Exh.C); see also, e.g., id. at S3086-87 (Senator Capito inaccurately \n3  describing Advanced Clean Cars II as an “EV mandate”).  All of these statements made clear that \n4  the regulatory requirements disfavored by the speakers were those designed and promulgated by \n5  California.  No regulatory requirement designed or promulgated by any federal agency was ever \n6  identified. \n7  108.  Those in favor of the Resolutions also made clear they were relying on the \n8  “submission by the Trump EPA” as the sole basis for application of the CRA’s expedited \n9  procedures.  117 Cong. Rec. S3087 (May 21, 2025) (Senator Capito describing agency \n10  submission as sufficient to “trigger[] my right as a Senator to introduce this resolution to block \n11  California’s EV mandate”) (Exh. C); see also id. at S3088 (repeatedly using the phrase “Agency-\n12  submitted rules” rather than simply “rules”).  Indeed, Senate leadership exclusively credited \n13  “President Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin … submitting the approved California \n14  waiver[s]” for the opportunity to use the CRA and to enact the Resolutions.  Id. at S3807. \n15  109.  As noted, that was the full purpose and effect of Senate Majority Leader Thune’s \n16  second point of order:  to allow the Senate to proceed on the Resolutions simply because EPA \n17  submitted CRA reports concerning the waiver decisions, without regard to EPA’s express, prior \n18  conclusions in the Federal Register notices or the independent determinations of the GAO and \n19  Senate Parliamentarian that these waiver decisions are not rules, and without any congressional \n20  finding that these EPA actions are rules actually subject to the CRA.  See also 117 Cong. Rec. \n21  S3106 (May 22, 2025) (Exh. D) (“Before dinner yesterday, these bills to gut California’s Clean \n22  Air Act authority were recognized as regular bills, subject to the filibuster rule requiring 60 votes \n23  to move forward, open to full debate and amendments, but somehow, after dinnertime yesterday, \n24  once Senate Republicans were done with overruling the Parliamentarian, these bills were now not \n25  subject to the filibuster.”). \n26  110.  Nonetheless, throughout the Senate proceedings, advocates for the Resolutions \n27  continued to acknowledge that, by its plain terms, the CRA “applies only to allow for disapproval \n28  of Federal Agency rules and only during a prescribed time defined by the statute.”  117 Cong. \n   26   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 28 of 43\n \n1  Rec. S3088 (May 21, 2025) (Exh. C).  They also described the expedited Senate procedures as \n2  established “by law,” id. at S3087, although they had purported to alter the trigger for those \n3  procedures by a mere point of order.   \n4  111.  The next day, May 22, 2025, the Senate voted on each of the Resolutions and passed \n5  all three with votes of 51-45 (H.J. Res. 87, Advanced Clean Trucks), 51-44 (H.J. Res. 88, \n6  Advanced Clean Cars II), and 49-46 (H.J. Res. 89, Omnibus). \n7  112.  EPA “hail[ed]” the Resolutions with a press release indicating that President Trump \n8  would sign them and again mischaracterizing the California regulations as an “EV Mandate.”  \n9  EPA, EPA Hails Congressional Disapproval of Biden EPA’s California EV Mandate Rule (May \n10  22, 2025).35  EPA described the Resolutions as “maintaining a consistent national approach to \n11  vehicle standards”—an approach the Clean Air Act explicitly rejects—and as preventing a “single \n12  state” from imposing “its radical agenda.”  Id. \n13  113.

Plaintiffs incorporate each and every one of the preceding allegations as if alleged \n18 \nherein. \n19 \n115.  No statute empowers any of the Defendants to intentionally utilize a statute that is \n20 \ninapplicable to these waiver decisions—as declared on the face of the actions—simply because it \n21 \nprovides a faster or easier, but unlawful, means to a desired end.   \n22 \n116.  Certainly, no statute empowers Defendants to reclassify agency actions from \n23 \nadjudicatory orders into rules after the actions are final and the agency proceedings are complete.  \n24 \nNor does any statute empower any of the Defendants to take such actions without any public \n25 \nprocess and without providing any explanation or justification for the reclassification.   \n26 \n27 \n \n28  35 Available at https://perma.cc/WW4C-Z4P7, last visited May 23, 2025. \n   27   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 29 of 43\n \n1  117.  Yet, that is precisely what President Trump and Administrator Zeldin purported to do \n2  by fiat in their February 14, 2025 Oval Office announcement and press release.  Their post-hoc \n3  reclassification of these three waiver decisions from adjudicatory orders to rules was ultra vires. \n4  118.  That reclassification was the sole basis for the submission of these waivers to \n5  Congress as “rules” subject to the CRA.  The submission was also ultra vires because it had no \n6  lawful premise and because no statute empowers Defendants to recharacterize, much less \n7  mischaracterize, agency actions to Congress.  Nor does any statute empower Defendants to do so \n8  after the agency action has gone into effect. \n9  119.  Defendants took these ultra vires actions to provide a pretextual basis for the use of \n10  the CRA to disapprove adjudicatory orders granting the three waivers at issue, and the \n11  Resolutions would not have been enacted without that pretextual basis.  The Resolutions thus \n12  “stand[] or fall[] on the validity of the” actions taken by the President, EPA, and its \n13  Administrator.  See INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 938 (1983).   \n14  120.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that Defendants \n15  reclassification and submission actions were ultra vires and the resulting Resolutions are \n16  unlawful, void, and of no effect. \n17  121.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, \n18  enjoining EPA and its Administrator from giving the Resolutions any legal effect and from taking \n19  similar actions as to other Clean Air Act adjudicatory orders. \n20  COUNT II \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n21 \n(Against the United States, EPA and Its Administrator) \n22 \n122.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every one of the preceding allegations as if alleged \n23 \nherein. \n24 \n123.  Congress “enacted the APA as a check upon administrators whose zeal might \n25 \notherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.”  \n26 \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 391 (2024) (internal quotation marks and \n27 \ncitation omitted). \n28 \n   28   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 30 of 43\n \n1  124.  EPA is an “agency” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  Both the agency and its \n2  Administrator must follow the APA when it applies. \n3  125.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \n4  and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n5  accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \n6  statutory right,” or “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), \n7  (C), (D). \n8  126.  In carrying out the purported reclassification of these adjudicatory orders into rules \n9  (and the follow-on submission to Congress), EPA and its Administrator (“EPA Defendants”) \n10  failed to observe the procedures required by law and took arbitrary and capricious actions that \n11  contravened core principles of reasoned decision-making. \n12  127.  Indeed, they followed no procedure at all.  Administrator Zeldin simply referred to \n13  the waiver decisions as “rules” in a press release.  That does not suffice to reclassify an action \n14  after it was finalized pursuant to the opposite view.  See supra n.19.  Agencies cannot supplant \n15  earlier conclusions with “impermissible post hoc rationalization,” DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of \n16  Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1908 (2020) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), much less can \n17  they do so by way of unsupported references in a press release, FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \n18  Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  That the challenged agency actions—the reclassification and \n19  submission—were taken without any process and without acknowledgment, let alone explanation, \n20  for the change in position renders them unlawful—particularly given States’ reliance on these \n21  waivers to protect public health and welfare.  Id. \n22  128.  All of the EPA Defendants’ actions were predicated on a new (albeit implicit) \n23  interpretation of the APA term “rule,” but that interpretation is contrary to the statute’s text.  \n24  EPA’s waiver decisions do not “implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy” as rules do.  5 \n25  U.S.C. § 551(4).   \n26  129.  That is clear from the nature of waiver proceedings which, pursuant to the Clean Air \n27  Act’s text, do not begin with notices of proposed rulemaking.  Rather, by congressional design, a \n28  waiver proceeding commences with a request from California that includes a finding that the \n   29   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 31 of 43\n \n1  State’s new motor vehicle emission standards “will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of \n2  public health and welfare” as EPA’s federal standards.  42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(1).  EPA must then \n3  grant California’s waiver request, unless evidence supports one of three factual determinations \n4  that could support a denial.  Id. § 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \n5  130.  In contrast with its power to “prescribe” federal vehicle emission standards under a \n6  separate provision of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7521(a)(1)), EPA’s role “in a waiver \n7  proceeding” is thus “sharply restricted.”  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1121.  EPA does not determine the \n8  pollutants to be regulated, the stringency of the standards, or the speed with which standards \n9  increase in stringency.  California makes all those choices in a state rulemaking proceeding, \n10  before it submits a waiver request to EPA.  For its part, EPA determines only whether any \n11  “parties favoring denial of the waiver” have met their evidentiary burden to obtain that result.  Id. \n12  131.  Put another way, it is California’s actions here (not EPA’s) that are “designed to \n13  prescribe law”—namely, the emission standards and other requirements vehicle manufacturers \n14  must meet in the State.  5 U.S.C. § 551(4) (defining “rule”).  EPA issues an “order” as “a final \n15  disposition” of California’s request; and that order—like a licensing decision—either grants or \n16  denies California permission to engage in a course of conduct (i.e., enforcement of its regulatory \n17  program).  Id. §§ 551(6) (defining “order” and including “licensing”), 551(8) (defining “license”). \n18  132.  The EPA Defendants’ APA violations provided a pretextual basis for the use of the \n19  CRA by the United States to disapprove these waivers, and the Resolutions would not have been \n20  enacted without that pretextual basis.  The Resolutions thus “stand[] or fall[] on the validity of \n21  the” actions taken by the EPA Defendants.  See Chadha, 462 U.S. at 938.   \n22  133.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the \n23  reclassification and submission actions, and the resulting Resolutions, are unlawful, void, and of \n24  no effect. \n25  134.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706, Plaintiffs are entitled to vacatur of EPA Defendants’ \n26  reclassification and submission actions. \n27  135.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, \n28  enjoining EPA and its Administrator from giving the Resolutions any legal effect. \n   30   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 32 of 43\n \n1  COUNT III \nViolation of the Congressional Review Act \n2 \n(Against All Defendants) \n3  136.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every one of the preceding allegations as if alleged \n4  herein. \n5  137.  By its own plain terms, the CRA does not apply to these waiver decisions because \n6  EPA’s waiver actions are orders, not rules, as defined by the APA (and incorporated in the CRA).  \n7  And, even if waiver decisions were rules, they would still not be rules of general applicability that \n8  would be subject to the CRA.  Until its post-hoc change of position here, EPA consistently \n9  maintained that waiver decisions are adjudicatory orders that dispose of California’s requests. It \n10  reiterated that position in each of the three final orders here.  \n11  138.  Based on EPA’s longstanding position (affirmed by the GAO) that these waiver \n12  decisions are adjudicatory orders, not rules, EPA did not submit these waiver decisions to \n13  Congress when it issued the orders.  Notably, no member of Congress sought a determination \n14  from the GAO that these decisions were rules, rather than adjudicatory orders.  In other words, no \n15  member of Congress sought to apply the CRA to these waiver decisions when the decisions \n16  issued, although these decisions took effect upon issuance and the CRA is expressly intended to \n17  apply before a rule takes effect.   \n18  139.   When Defendants later changed positions and declared these decisions were rules \n19  subject to the CRA, they never explained why.  Most notably, Defendants identified no errors in \n20  the legal analysis provided in the GAO’s 2023 determination that an earlier waiver decision was \n21  not a rule subject to the CRA, although Congress had relied on that determination at the time by \n22  declining to take up resolutions of disapproval. \n23  140.  The GAO and the Senate Parliamentarian—the nonpartisan arbiters that advise \n24  Congress on the CRA’s applicability—concurred with the position EPA announced in these \n25  waiver decisions:  they are not rules and are, therefore, outside the scope of the CRA.   \n26  141.  The CRA’s plain terms—the terms to which all fifty States consented—cabin its use; \n27  and that purported use was unlawful here.  Indeed, there was no “reasonable relation between the \n28 \n   31   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 33 of 43\n \n1  mode or method of proceeding”—i.e., the CRA—“and the result which [the Federal Government] \n2  sought” here—i.e., rendering particular state rules unenforceable.  United States v. Ballin, 144 \n3  U.S. 1, 5 (1892).   \n4  142.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the \n5  Resolutions are unlawful, void, and of no effect. \n6  143.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, \n7  enjoining EPA and its Administrator from giving the Resolutions any legal effect. \n8  COUNT IV \nViolation of the Take Care Clause \n9 \n(Against President Trump, EPA, and Its Administrator) \n10 \n144.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every one of the preceding allegations as if alleged \n11 \nherein. \n12 \n145.  Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that the President—and pursuant to \n13 \nhis direction, the Executive Branch—“shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. \n14 \nConst. art. II, § 3. \n15 \n146.  All Executive Branch Defendants were aware that the three waiver decisions at issue \n16 \nare not rules, much less rules of general applicability, subject to the CRA.  That had been EPA’s \n17 \nconsistent position since the enactment of the CRA, under Presidents of both parties.  And EPA \n18 \nreiterated that position in these very decisions.  These Defendants were also aware that the \n19 \nGAO—the non-partisan body that aids Congress in implementing the CRA—had concluded, in \n20 \n2023, that Clean Air Act preemption waiver decisions are not rules and not subject to that statute. \n21 \n147.  The Executive Branch Defendants nonetheless declared, by press release, that these \n22 \nactions were suddenly rules of general applicability subject to the CRA.  They then submitted \n23 \nthese waiver decisions to Congress and the GAO for CRA action, claiming (without support) this \n24 \nwas “in accordance with statutory requirements.”  See supra n.19.  Notably, EPA had to submit \n25 \nthese waiver decisions to Congress twice because in the first submission, EPA correctly described \n26 \nthe decisions not as “rules,” but as “actions” and “Notice[s] of Decision.” \n27 \n28 \n   32   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 34 of 43\n \n1  148.  The Executive Branch Defendants purported to replace the statutory definition of \n2  “rule” with their own, unidentified one.  These Defendants did so purely for purposes of using a \n3  statute they knew to be inapplicable—and one they hoped would preclude judicial review. \n4  149.  The Executive Branch Defendants neither exercised care nor even attempted to \n5  faithfully execute the Nation’s laws, including the Clean Air Act, the APA, the CRA, and the \n6  Constitution. \n7  150.  The Executive Branch Defendants’ failure to honor their constitutional duties were \n8  deliberate efforts to use—and enable Congress’s use—of the CRA to disapprove of these waivers.  \n9  These actions were unconstitutional, and so, too, are the Resolutions that depend on them. \n10  151.   Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the \n11  Resolutions are unlawful, void, and of no effect. \n12  152.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, \n13  enjoining EPA and its Administrator from giving the Resolutions any legal effect. \n14  COUNT V \nViolation of Separation of Powers \n15 \n(Against All Defendants) \n16 \n153.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every one of the preceding allegations as if alleged \n17 \nherein. \n18 \n154.  The “checks and balances” established in the Constitution “were the foundation of a \n19 \nstructure of government that would protect liberty.”  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 722 (1986).  \n20 \n“The Framers provided a vigorous Legislative Branch and a separate and wholly independent \n21 \nExecutive Branch, with each branch responsible ultimately to the people.”  Id.  “The Framers also \n22 \nprovided for a Judicial Branch equally independent with “‘[t]he judicial Power ... extend[ing] to \n23 \nall Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, and the Laws of the United States,’” \n24 \nid. (quoting U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2), and expressly to those cases in which the United States or \n25 \none of the several States is a party, U.S. Const. Art. III, §§ 1, 2. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n   33   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 35 of 43\n \n1  155.  The Federal Government was “deliberately so structured to assure full, vigorous, and \n2  open debate on the great issues affecting the people and to provide avenues for the operation of \n3  checks on the exercise of governmental power.”  Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 722. \n4  156.  Using its lawmaking powers, Congress expressly cabined the CRA so it applies only \n5  to certain rules promulgated by federal agencies.  E.g., 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A); id. § 804(3) \n6  (defining “rule[s]” to which CRA applies).  Congress could, of course, use those same lawmaking \n7  powers to amend the CRA—for example, by changing the trigger for its application or by \n8  changing the definition of “rule.”  It did not do so here, however. \n9  157.  Instead, Congress opted to proceed as though the term “rule” had a different \n10  definition than the one in 5 U.S.C. § 804(3) or was entirely irrelevant to the statutory scheme.  \n11  Specifically, Congress relied exclusively on the submission of a report from EPA characterizing \n12  the waiver decisions as rules as a sufficient trigger for application of the CRA.  The Senate did so \n13  explicitly in its second point of order.  See supra ¶¶ 103-106.  The House did so as well by \n14  proceeding to vote on the Resolutions, although CRA resolutions are only proper as to certain \n15  federal rules (as defined in the statute), and although no one offered any credible basis for \n16  disagreeing with EPA’s stated position in these Federal Register notices (affirmed by the GAO \n17  and Senate Parliamentarian) that these waiver decisions do not fit that definition.  \n18  158.  Each chamber improperly delegated its constitutional authority “to determine the \n19  Rules of its Proceedings,” U.S. Const., art. I, § 5, cl. 2, to the Executive Branch.  Both chambers \n20  purported to employ their rules for CRA resolutions based exclusively on mere statements by the \n21  Executive Branch—no matter how spurious—that these orders were rules of the sort subject to \n22  the CRA.   \n23  159.  Maintaining separation of powers for congressional procedural rules is no less \n24  important than maintaining that separation for more substantive powers.  “The Constitution … is \n25  concerned with means as well as ends.”  Horne v. Dep't of Agric., 576 U.S. 350, 362 (2015).  “To \n26  leave this aspect of the constitutional structure alone undefended would serve only to accelerate \n27  the flight of power from the legislative to the executive branch, turning the latter into a vortex of \n28 \n   34   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 36 of 43\n \n1  authority that was constitutionally reserved for the people’s representatives in order to protect \n2  their liberties.”  Gundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 169 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \n3  160.  And, as James Madison reiterated, quoting “the famous warning of Montesquieu,” \n4  “‘there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same \n5  person, or body of magistrates.’”  Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 721–22 (quoting The Federalist No. 47, p. \n6  325 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)). \n7  161.  The rules Congress adopts for its own proceedings cannot “ignore constitutional \n8  restraints,” and Congress is responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring there is “a reasonable \n9  relation between the mode or method of [its] proceeding … and the result which is sought to be \n10  attained.”  NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 551 (2014) (quoting United States v. Ballin, 144 \n11  U.S. 1, 5 (1892)).  \n12  162.  It matters not that Congress’s abdication of its internal rulemaking powers reflected \n13  the preferences (in favor of the use of the CRA) of majorities in Congress.  Separation of powers \n14  problems are not erased simply because “the encroached-upon branch approves the \n15  encroachment.”  Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 497 (2010) \n16  (quoting New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 182 (1992)). \n17  163.  Congress’s decision to allow the Executive Branch to be the sole arbiter of what the \n18  definition of “rule” means under the APA and CRA also unconstitutionally intruded on the \n19  judiciary’s Article III power “to say what the law is.”  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 \n20  (1803); U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. \n21  164.  So, too, did Congress’s direction that preexisting federal law preempts particular state \n22  laws, where Congress failed to legislatively change the legal standard for that preemption.  Put \n23  another way, Congress may not enact “a statute [that] would create no new substantive law” but \n24  “instead direct the court how pre-existing law applies to particular circumstances.”  Bank Markazi \n25  v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 226 n.17 (2016). \n26  165.  In these waiver decisions, EPA exercised “the type of nonpolicymaking adjudicatory \n27  power[] typically exercised by a court in the agency-review context,” Martin v. Occupational \n28  Safety & Health Review Comm’n, 499 U.S. 144, 154 (1991), by pronouncing that particular laws \n   35   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 37 of 43\n \n1  are not preempted by the Clean Air Act.  EPA’s adjudicatory orders were the subject of pending \n2  litigation at the time the Resolutions were introduced and voted on. \n3  166.  The Resolutions “fail[] to supply any new legal standard effectuating the lawmakers’ \n4  [new] policy judgment,” Bank Markazi, 578 U.S. at 231, that the relevant state laws should be \n5  preempted by federal law.  Indeed, by applying the CRA—a statute designed to allow for \n6  rescission of new federal law made by the Executive Branch—beyond its bounds, Congress did \n7  not make law.  Rather, it disapproved the Executive Branch’s application of existing law to a \n8  particular factual record, ignoring both that the Executive Branch had acted within its powers in \n9  carrying out existing law and that the Judiciary might well agree with EPA’s decisions and is \n10  entitled to say so.   \n11  167.   “The hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to exceed the \n12  outer limits of its power, even to accomplish desirable objectives, must be resisted.”  Chadha, 462 \n13  U.S. at 951.  The Federal Government may not violate separation of powers principles, as it did \n14  here, even when doing so makes achieving desired objectives easier. \n15  168.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the \n16  Resolutions are unlawful, void, and of no effect. \n17  169.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, \n18  enjoining EPA and its Administrator from giving the Resolutions any legal effect. \n19  COUNT VI \nViolation of the Tenth Amendment and Structural Principles of Federalism \n20 \n(Against All Defendants) \n21 \n170.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every one of the preceding allegations as if alleged \n22 \nherein. \n23 \n171.  A “fundamental limitation that the constitutional scheme imposes on the Commerce \n24 \nClause to protect the ‘States as States’ is one of process.”  Garcia, 469 U.S. at 554.  Thus, courts \n25 \nmay—and indeed must—intervene “to compensate for possible failings in the national political \n26 \nprocess” that infringe on the States as States.  Id.  And that is not the only “affirmative limit[] the \n27 \nconstitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce \n28 \n   36   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 38 of 43\n \n1  Clause.”  South Carolina, 485 U.S. 505, 528 (1988) (Scalia, J, concurring in part) (quoting \n2  Garcia, 469 U.S. at 556).  \n3  172.  These Resolutions were enacted only because both the Executive and Legislative \n4  Branches opted to flout settled procedures and the plain text of the CRA (to which all States \n5  consented).  The Executive Branch began this unprecedented maneuver when, without any \n6  process or explanation, it issued a blatantly unlawful post-hoc declaration that the three \n7  adjudicatory orders at issue were suddenly rules.  With the President’s imprimatur, Congress then \n8  compounded the errors, opting to disregard and overrule the reasoned decisions of both the GAO \n9  and the Senate Parliamentarian, although those decisions are ordinarily treated as dispositive. \n10  173.  By purporting to use the CRA (despite its clear inapplicability), the Federal \n11  Government blasted gaping holes in longstanding state regulatory programs without any of the \n12  procedural mechanisms—such as rigorous debate and state official testimony—that serve to \n13  inform members of Congress about the consequences of their actions.  In the push to end the \n14  alleged “electric vehicle fantasy,” for example, state regulations that require crucial emission \n15  reductions from gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles got swept in for termination too.  \n16  174.  In so doing, the Federal Government also effectively changed the substantive criteria \n17  applicable to a California waiver request retroactively—years after California submitted its \n18  requests (and in one instance years after EPA acted on that request).  The Federal Government \n19  also created uncertainty about how it will apply the waiver provision’s statutory criteria to future \n20  waiver requests. \n21  175.  Put simply, the Federal Government carried out an illegal playbook designed to evade \n22  lawful procedures that might prevent the “take down” of disfavored California laws.  The Federal \n23  Government cast aside expert legal opinions and the plain text of the CRA in order to extend that \n24  statute’s expedited procedures beyond the bounds to which all States agreed.  Defendants \n25  provided no opportunity for California, or the public, to participate in crucial parts in this scheme.  \n26  And Defendants and congressional leadership chose to use the CRA here precisely because, when \n27  that statute applies, it severely limits debate, avoids the filibuster, and contains a barrier to \n28  judicial review.  Those features further prevented Plaintiff States from defending their own state \n   37   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 39 of 43\n \n1  laws in the political process; and the Federal Government seeks to prevent Plaintiff States from \n2  obtaining relief in the courts.   \n3  176.  The Framers designed a Federal Government that would “be disinclined to invade the \n4  rights of the individual States, or the prerogatives of their governments.”  Garcia, 469 U.S. at 551 \n5  (quoting The Federalist No. 46, at 332 (B. Wright ed. 1961)).  These Resolutions required an end-\n6  run around that design.  The numerous “extraordinary defects in the national political process” \n7  reflected in that end-run render the Resolutions “invalid under the Tenth Amendment” and the \n8  principles of federalism embedded in the Constitution’s structure.  South Carolina, 485 U.S. at \n9  512.   \n10  177.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the \n11  Resolutions are unlawful, void, and of no effect. \n12  178.

Plaintiffs incorporate each and every one of the preceding allegations as if alleged \n17 \nherein. \n18 \n180.  Federal courts possess inherent equitable power to grant injunctive and declaratory \n19 \nrelief “with respect to violations of federal law by federal officials,” Armstrong v. Exceptional \n20 \nChild Ctr., 575 U.S. 320, 326–27 (2015), among them violations that themselves contravene the \n21 \nstructural principles of the Constitution, see Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491–92 n.2, or actions \n22 \npremised on legislation that does. \n23 \n181.  The President, EPA, and its Administrator have stated definitely that the state \n24 \nregulations at issue here, including the Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and \n25 \nOmnibus regulations, became preempted and unenforceable upon enactment of the respective \n26 \nResolutions and are now preempted and unenforceable. \n27 \n182.  Each of the Resolutions is unlawful and unconstitutional. \n28 \n   38   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 40 of 43\n \n1  183.  Because the Resolutions are unlawful, unconstitutional and void, the preemption \n2  waivers granted for California’s addition of the state regulations at issue, including the Advanced \n3  Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Omnibus regulations, to the State’s regulatory \n4  program are valid and in effect. \n5  184.  Because these preemption waivers are valid and in effect, Plaintiffs are entitled to an \n6  injunction against EPA and its Administrator to prohibit the rejection of certifications of vehicle \n7  or engine manufacturer compliance with the state regulations at issue—including the Advanced \n8  Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and/or Omnibus regulations—as compliant with federal \n9  Clean Air Act standards under 42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(3). \n10  185.  Because these preemption waivers are valid and in effect, Plaintiffs are entitled to an \n11  injunction against EPA and its Administrator to prohibit their taking other actions to implement \n12  or give legal effect to the Resolutions. \n13  186.  Because these preemption waivers are valid and in effect, Plaintiffs are entitled to an \n14  injunction against EPA and its Administrator to prohibit interference with Plaintiffs’ enforcement \n15  of any state law on the ground that one or more of the Resolutions resulted in preemption of that \n16  state law. \n17  187.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the \n18  Resolutions are unlawful, void, and of no effect.  \n19  188.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that any action by \n20  Defendants premised on validity of the unconstitutional Resolutions is itself unlawful, void, and \n21  of no effect. \n22  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n23 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs State of California, et al. respectfully request that this Court \n24 \n1.  Declare the Resolutions unconstitutional, unlawful, void, and of no effect; \n25 \n2.  Declare that the three preemption waivers at issue are valid and in effect; \n26 \n3.  Declare that any action by Defendants premised on validity of the Resolutions is \n27 \nunlawful, void, and of no effect; \n28 \n   39   \nComplaint  (25-cv-_________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-04966     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 41 of 43\n \n1  4.  Enjoin EPA and its Administrator from taking any action to implement or give legal \n2  effect to the Resolutions; \n3  5.  Enjoin EPA and its Administrator from rejecting certifications of vehicle or engine \n4  manufacturer compliance with the state regulations for which EPA waived Clean Air Act \n5  preemption in the decisions at issue, including the Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean \n6  Trucks, and Omnibus regulations, as compliant with federal Clean Air Act standards under 42 \n7  U.S.C. § 7543(b)(3); \n8  6.  Enjoin EPA and its Administrator from interfering with Plaintiffs’ enforcement of \n9  any state law on the ground that one or more of the Resolutions resulted in preemption of that \n10  state law; \n11  7.  Declare the reclassification and submission of the three preemption waiver decisions \n12  as federal agency rules ultra vires, unconstitutional, and unlawful; \n13  8.  Vacate EPA’s reclassification of the three preemption waiver decisions as federal \n14  rules and the submission of those decisions as rules to Congress; \n15  9.  Declare that the CRA does not apply to EPA waiver decisions under 42 U.S.C. § \n16  7543(b)(1); \n17  10.  Enjoin EPA and its Administrator from transmitting these or other Clean Air Act \n18  waiver decisions under 42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(1) to Congress for consideration under the CRA; \n19  11.  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n20   \n \n21  Dated:  June 12, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n22  ROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \n23  MYUNG J.
