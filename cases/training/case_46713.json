    "summary": "<p>This case challenges the Trump Administration's American Energy Exemption Proclamation, which exempted 68 coal-fired power plants from updated federal limits on hazardous air pollutants. On June 12, 2025, twelve environmental advocacy groups filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its Administrator. The plaintiffs claimed violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Clean Air Act. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Proclamation was unlawful, vacatur of the Proclamation, an injunction barring the EPA from enforcing it, and an order directing the agency to notify affected facilities that the exemptions were invalid. Judge Paul L. Friedman was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs contended that the President had improperly invoked the narrow exemption power under the Clean Air Act, which applied only to individual &ldquo;stationary sources&rdquo; and only where the specific facility lacked available technology and its exemption served the national security interest. They claimed that the Proclamation&rsquo;s blanket exemption of 68 coal-fired power plants failed to include the individualized findings required by statute, ignored the availability of pollution-control technologies, did not meet the statutory standards of necessity or national interest, and exceeded the legal authority granted to the executive branch under the Clean Air Act.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the plaintiffs asserted that the Proclamation and its implementation by the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act because the agencies had acted arbitrarily and capriciously, failed to follow notice-and-comment procedures, and lacked a reasoned basis for their decision.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 3, 2025, Judge Friedman ordered the case be held in abeyance until March 3, 2026 for purposes of judicial economy. Here, EPA is reconsidering Biden-era rules created to enforce the Clean Air Act. If EPA issues new rules, the President would no longer need to rely on the Proclamation's blanket exemption. If EPA repeals the existing rules to issue new rules, both the Proclamation and this case would be moot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

In a proclamationissuedonApril 8, 2025, President Donald Trump purported to \nexempt nearly one-third of coal-fired power plants across the country from mercuryand other \ntoxic air pollution standards critical to protecting Americans, especially infants and children, \nfrom a range of harmful health impacts and risks including cancer, birth defects, and \ndevelopmental harms in children. Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote \nAmerican Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 16,777 (Apr. 21, 2025)(attached as Exhibit 1)(“Exemption \nProclamation”). President Trump declared those sweeping exemptions by invoking Section \n7412(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4), a narrow andnever-before-used \n2\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 3 of 58\nprovision authorizing the President to provide a limited exemption from compliance with\nhazardous air pollutant emission standards in instances where “the technology to implement” the \nrelevant standard is “not available” and when exempting a facility “is in the national security \ninterests of the United States.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4). Now, for the first time in the history of the \nClean Air Act, President Trumpand theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) seek to \nexploit that narrow provision to indiscriminately exempt scores of coal-fired power plants. Many \nof the exempted power plants have already installed and are actively using the technology \nsufficient to meet the targeted mercury and other toxic air pollution standards—technology that \nEPA itself determined was available in a final rule issued just over a year ago, based on an ample \nrecord developed through public notice and comment.  \n2.  Congress authorized use of Section 7412(i)(4) to exempt a stationary source only \nwhere the technology to implement a standard is not available. President Trump violated this \nlimitation by issuing exemptions where the technology is available but where he wishes to \nrelieve sources of their need to expend costs to comply with pollution standards while the \nAdministration undertakes proceedings to repeal them. The Clean Air Act does not permit this \nuse of Section7412(i)(4) authority.The Exemption Proclamation is illegal and must be \ninvalidated.\n3. TheExemption Proclamationexempts 68 coal-fired power plants from Clean Air \nAct standards EPA adopted in 2024 to modernize existing pollution standards forhighly toxic \nsubstances such as mercury, arsenic, and nickel that are emitted by coal-fired power plants in \nlight of developments in pollution control technologies. National Emission Standards for \nHazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units Review \n3\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 4 of 58\nof the Residual Risk and Technology Review, 89 Fed. Reg. 38,508 (May 7, 2024) (attached as \nExhibit 2) (“2024 Rule”). \n4. The 2024 Rule established more protectivelimits on mercury emissions from \npower plants burning lignite coal,and lowered emission limits for arsenic, nickel, and other toxic \nmetals from all coal-fired power plants. EPA also required plants to demonstrate compliance with \nthe arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals standard using continuous emissions monitoring \nsystems that provide real-time feedback,and tightened pollution standards for power plants\nduring their startup periods.  \n5.  EPA required power plants to comply with the startup standard by January 2025 \nand established a compliance deadline ofJuly 2027 for the lignite mercury standard, the arsenic, \nnickel, and other metals standard, and the continuous emissions monitoring requirement. From \n2028-2037, the standards were expected to reduce significant quantities of mercury,arsenic, \nnickel, and other toxic metals,delivering cleaner, healthier air and water nationwide from Texas \nand North Dakota to Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  \n6.  The President’s Exemption Proclamation jeopardizes the realization of these \npublic health benefits without any proper basis.Section 7412(i)(4) authorizes the President in \nexceptional circumstances to exempt a “stationary source” only if the President “determines” that \n“the technology to implement such standard is not available” for that source and “it is in the \nnational security interests” to do so. The President violates these firm statutory requirements by \nissuing exemptions to coal-fired power plants based on a conclusory and false claim that “[t]he \ntechnology to implement the Rule is not available” and that “[s]uch technology does not exist in \na commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the Rule \nby its compliance date of July 8, 2027.”  To the extent these and the other claims in the \n4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 5 of 58\nExemption Proclamation operate as “determinations,” they cannot support the exemptions issued \nbecause they fail to make any determination grounded in the factual circumstances specific to the \n68 coal-fired power plants exempted, as the statute requires.  \n7.   The exempted power plants vary with regards to the actions they need to take to \ncomply with the 2024 Rule, but the Exemption Proclamation treats them equally with a broad \nbrush, does not identify which control technologies any of the 68 coal-fired power plants require \nto implement the 2024 Rule, and does not identify which of those control technologies are \nunavailable. The President has not, in the Exemption Proclamation itself or otherwise, provided \nany factual basis, reasoning, or other support for the exemptions.  \n8.  Moreover, the Exemption Proclamation’s claims are contradicted both by EPA’s \nown recent findings just 11 months earlier that that technology is readily available and by the \nfact that technology sufficient for meeting the standards is already used by many coal-fired \npower plants, including by some of those the President exempted. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. 38,508, \n38,531, 38,536-37, 38,539. \n9.  In 2024, EPA found that coal-fired power plants that burn lignite coal could lower \nmercury emissions by using more of the same chemical additives those plants were already using \nto comply with existing, less stringent,mercury limits. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,540. EPA found that \ncoal-fired power plants responsible for generating 93 percent of total coal-fired energy had \nalready demonstrated the ability to meet the revisedlower limit for arsenic, nickel, and other \nmetals with existing controls and that this standardcould be met using available control \ntechnology. Id.at 38,530. EPA found that approximately one-third of the existing coal power \nplant fleet was already using continuous emissions monitoring systems, id.at 38,535, and that \nthese monitoringsystems provide superior “certainty, accuracy, transparency, and granularity” \n5\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 6 of 58\nwhile costing only slightly more than the existing requirement to conduct pollution emissions \ntesting a handful of times per year. Id. at 38,536-37. EPA also found that the vast majority of \nplants were already able to meet the startup standardthe 2024 Rule required for all coal-fired \npower plants. Id. at 38,551.  \n10. The Exemption Proclamation does not rest on findings of any coal-fired power \nplant’s actual inability to comply with the 2024 Rule at all, much less to a degree that implicates \nnational security. Nor does it contain such findings for each of the named plants that it purports \nto exempt from clean air standards. Rather, the real reason and basis for the exemption, as is \napparent from the Proclamation itself and the circumstances leading to its issuance, is to provide \n“regulatory relief” to coal plants in furtherance of President Trump’s policy “to promote \nAmerican energy” through deregulation as baldly stated in the Exemption Proclamation’s title, \n“Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Energy.” 90 Fed. Reg. \n16,777 (Apr. 21, 2025). That is not a permissible basis for granting Section 7412(i)(4) \nexemptions. \n11.  President Trump and his administration have made no secret of their intent to \nundo a suite of public health and environmental regulations adopted by the last administration. In \nMarch, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin declared “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has \nseen,” announcing the rollback of 31 regulations, including the 2024 Rule. EPA, News Release, \nEPA Launches Biggest Deregulatory Action in U.S. History (Mar. 12, 2025), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history.  \n12. New presidential administrations that wish to reconsider and revise regulations \ngenerally must comply with statutory administrative procedure requirements such as notice-and-\ncomment rulemakingunder the Administrative Procedure Act and the Clean Air Act. The Trump \n6\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 7 of 58\nadministration announced in a March press release and fact sheet that they would “reconsider” \nthe 2024 Rulebecause of “concerns” about compliance costs and burdens on the coal industry. \nAt the same time, EPA also announced that,“[t]he Trump Administration is considering a 2-year \ncompliance exemption via Section [7412](i)(4) of the Clean Air Act for affected power plants \nwhile EPA goes through the rulemaking process.” EPA, News Release, Trump EPA Announces \nReconsideration of Air Rules Regulating American Energy, Manufacturing, Chemical Sectors \n(NESHAPs) (Mar. 12, 2025), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-\nreconsideration-air-rules-regulating-american-energy-manufacturing. On June 11, EPA issued a \nproposed rule to repeal certain requirements of the 2024 Rule.

In disregarding the limitations imposed by Section 7412(i)(4), Defendants \nimproperly circumvented the procedural requirements (including public comment) that properly \nconstrain agency decisions to weaken, or delay application of, pollution standards. This exercise \nwas plainly unlawful. The Clean Air Act authorizes permitting authorities to providesources \none-year compliance extensions “if necessary for the installation of controls.” 42 U.S.C. \n§7412(i)(3)(B). Other than that,EPA has authority to revise pollutionstandards and compliance \ndeadlineswhere the statute allows,1 but only after engaging in the public notice and comment \nprocess mandated by the Clean Air Act in 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(1), addressing procedural \nrequirements for rulemaking, and only when the substantive standards of 42 U.S.C. § 7412, \n \n1The compliance deadlines for rules promulgated under 42 U.S.C. § 7412 are strictly managed \nby Section 7412(i)(3)(A). \n7\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 8 of 58\nwhich governs pollution standards for the hazardous air pollution at issue here, are met. The \nPresident lacks authority to exempt coal-fired power plants from emission standards so that EPA \ncan revise or undo the standards themselves.\n14. Plaintiff environmental and public health groups bring this action challenging the \nExemption Proclamation as issued in violation of the Clean Air Act and as beyond the \nPresident’s lawful authority. Plaintiffs seek an order declaring the Exemption Proclamation to be \nunlawful and invalid and enjoining EPA and its Administrator from implementing or giving \neffect to it.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n15. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this is \na civil action arising under laws of the United States, including the Clean Air Act. \n16. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e) because Plaintiff \nEnvironmental Integrity Project resides in this judicial district, because Defendants reside in this \njudicial district, and because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in \nthis judicial district.\n17. The Court has authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide injunctive \nrelief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202; the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651; and the Court’s \ninherent equitable powers. \n18. Although the Clean Air Act provides for judicial review through “[a] petition for \nreview of action of the Administrator” of “any emission standard or requirement under section \n7412 . . . or any other nationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken, by the \n8\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 9 of 58\nAdministrator” in the D.C.

Defendant Lee Zeldin is the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency. He resides and conducts his duties in Washington, D.C. He is sued in his official \ncapacity. \nLEGAL BACKGROUND  \n34. Clean Air Act Section 7412, 42 U.S.C. § 7412, sets forth theregulatory regime for \nEPA to address “hazardous air pollutants,” a group of 188 air pollutants determined by Congress \nand EPA to be particularly harmful to human health. Mercury, arsenic, hexavalent chromium, \nlead, and nickelare hazardous air pollutants under 42 U.S.C. § 7412. \n35. This sectionrequires EPA to regulate the largest “stationary sources” of hazardous \nair pollutants by promulgating pollution standards that “require the maximum degree of \nreduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants . . . (including a prohibition on such \nemissions where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of \nachieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts \nand energy requirements, determines is achievable.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2). \n36. For new sources, the statute provides that the standards adopted “shall not be less \nstringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar \nsource.”42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(3)(A). \n37. For existing sources, the statute provides that the standards adopted “shall not be \nless stringent, and may be more stringent than, the average emission limitation achieved by the \n13\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 14 of 58\nbest performing 12 percent of the existing sources” where there are at least 30 or more sources. \n42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(3)(A)-(B). \n38.  For “electric utility steam generating units”—i.e., combustion units at fossil-fuel \nfired power plants—the EPA Administrator is directed to perform a study of the hazards to public \nhealth reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of emissions from such units and the statute \nprovides EPA “shall” regulate those units under Section 7412 if the Administrator determines \nsuch regulation is appropriate and necessary after considering the results of the hazard study. 42 \nU.S.C. § 7412(n)(1)(A). EPA first made the determination that regulation of electric utility steam \ngenerating units under Section 7412 is necessary and appropriate in 2000. EPA made that \ndetermination again in 2024. \n39.  When EPA first adopts standards, Section 7412(d) provides a minimum level of \nstringency for those standards based on the best performing sources, known as the “maximum \nachievable control technology” or “MACT” “floor.” \n40.  After these pollution standards are adopted, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to \n“review, and revise” those standards every 8 years “as necessary (taking into account \ndevelopments in practices, processes, and control technologies).” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(6). This \nprocess is known as the “technology review” and ensures that standards are modernized as \nnecessary to reflect developments in pollution control technologies and otherwise to comply with \nthe Clean Air Act. \n41.  When EPA revises standards pursuant to Section 7412(d)(6), a court has held EPA \nmust consider the same statutory criteria set out in Section 7412(d)(2) that guide the initial \nstandard-setting—including cost and achievability. See Ass’n of Battery Recyclers v. EPA, 716 \nF.3d 667, 673-74 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  \n14\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 15 of 58\n42. A court has held that EPA is not required to re-calculate the MACT floors when \nrevising standards pursuant to Section7412(d)(6). Id. at 673.A court has held that when revising \nstandards, EPA generally must consider statutorily required factors including cost and \nachievability. \n43. Congress provided for a strict schedule of compliance with Section 7412 \nstandards. Emission standards “shall be effective upon promulgation.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2). \n“New sources,” those for which construction or reconstruction “is commenced after the \nAdministrator first proposes regulations under this section establishing an emission standard \napplicable to such source,” id. § 7412(a)(4), must comply no later than the effective date of that \nstandard, id. § 7412(i)(3)(A). “Existing sources,”those that are not “new,” id. § 7412(a)(10), \nmust comply no later than three years after the effective date, id. § 7412(i)(2). EPA may grant a \nsource up to one additional year to comply where “such additional period is necessary for the \ninstallation of controls.” Id. § 7412(i)(3). \n44.  The Clean Air Act authorizes the President, in narrowly prescribed circumstances, \nto provide compliance exemptions to stationary sources from Section 7412 hazardous air \npollutant standards. It provides: “The President may exempt any stationary source from \ncompliance with any standard or limitation under this section for a period of not more than 2 \nyears if the President determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available \nand that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so. An exemption under \nthis paragraph may be extended for 1 or more additional periods, each period not to exceed 2 \nyears. The President shall report to Congress with respect to each exemption (or extension \nthereof) made under this paragraph.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4). \n15\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 16 of 58\n45. The exemption provision only authorizes exemptions from a standard or \nlimitation established under Section7412.\n46.  D.C. Circuit case law generally allows for review of presidential actions to ensure \nconformity with statutory requirements, provided that “the authorizing statute or another statute \nplaces discernible limits on the President’s discretion.” Mountain States Legal Found. v. Bush, \n306 F.3d 1132, 1136 (D.C. Cir. 2002).The statutory provision here at issue, Section 7412(i)(4) \nprovides discernible limits on the President’s discretion, requiring a determination that \n“technology to implement” a standard “is not available” and that the exemption “is in the \nnational security interests of the United States.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4).    \n47. The Clean Air Act sets out requirements for rulemaking that apply to “the \npromulgation or revision of any emission standard or limitations under section 7412(d).” 42 \nU.S.C. § 7607(d)(1)(C). These requirements include establishing a rulemaking docket, \npublishing in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking, publicly providing factual \ndata and other information on which the proposed rule is based, allowing submission of written \ncomments, and providing an opportunity for a hearing, among others. Id. § 7607(d)(2)-(6), (h). \n48. The Clean Air Act provides EPA limited authority to stay rules that have taken \neffect. EPA may stay such rules only when it has commenced formal reconsideration proceedings \ndescribed in 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(7)(B). Those proceedings differ from an agency voluntarily \nrevisiting a promulgated rule as EPA is doing in its proposed rule to rescind portions of the 2024 \nRule. A rule remains in effect during a reconsideration proceeding unless it is stayed. A stay may \nnot exceed three months. 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(7)(B). EPA has not convened a Section \n7607(d)(7)(B) reconsideration proceeding for the 2024 Rule and has not sought to stay the \n16\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 17 of 58\neffectiveness of the 2024 Rule. Section 7607(d)(7)(B) is the sole authority EPA has to stay a rule \nafter its effective date has passed. See Clean Air Council v. Pruitt, 862 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n49. As part of EPA’s duties and authorities implementing the Clean Air Act Title V \noperating permit program, EPA has the statutory obligation to object to a permitting authority’s \nissuance of a Title V operating permit that is not in accordance with law and to require the \npermitting authority to revise the permit. See 42 U.S.C.§ 7661d(b); 40 C.F.R. § 70.8(c).If EPA \ndoes not object to such issuance, any person may petition EPA to make an objection. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 7661d(b)(2); 40 C.F.R. § 70.8(d). Any denial by EPA of such petition can be challenged \nin the relevant U.S. Court of Appeals under 42 U.S.C. § 7607 of the Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7661d(b)(2). \n50. EPA also has authority to order a permitting authority to reopen and revise a \ndeficient Title V operatingpermit. See 42 U.S.C. § 7661d(e); 40 C.F.R.§ 70.7(f), (g). If the \npermitting authority does not reopen and revise the permit within 90 days of receiving EPA’s \nreopening notification, EPA may modify or revoke and reissue the permit. See42 U.S.C. \n§ 7661d(e); 40 C.F.R. § 70.7(g)(2), (5).\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURALBACKGROUND\nA. EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards and the 2024 Rule\n51. EPA first set standards, known as the “Mercury and Air Toxics Standards,” for \nemissions of hazardous air pollutants from coal-fired power plants in 2012. National Emission \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal-and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam \nGenerating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, \nIndustrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam \n17\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 18 of 58\nGenerating Units, 77 Fed. Reg. 9,304 (Feb. 16, 2012)(“2012 Mercury and Air Toxics \nStandards”).\n52. In May 2024, EPA adopted the 2024 Rulepursuant to its obligation under Section\n7412(d)(6) to review “developments in practices, processes, and control technologies” and revise \nthe 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards “as necessary.” 89 Fed. Reg. 38,508, 38,513.\n53. EPA adopted the 2024 Rule after issuing a proposed rule and holding a public \ncomment period. The factual record for the 2024 Rule demonstrated that the 2024 Rule would \nbenefit public health by reducing harmful exposures to toxic pollutants threatening the safety of \ncommunities across the country. \n54.  Coal-fired power plants emit mercury, arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals, as \nwell as particulate matter. Mercury has adverse health effects including brain and spinal cord \ndamage. Babies are particularly vulnerable to mercury. Non-mercury toxic metals, including \narsenic, lead, nickel, and chromium have adverse health effects including cancer, kidney damage, \ndecreased pulmonary function, chronic health disorders such as lung irritation, pneumonia, and \ndamage to the central nervous system. \n55.  A coal-fired power plant consists of one or more electric utility steam generating \nunits—i.e., individual “coal-fired units” that burn coal to generate steam that is then converted \ninto electricity. \n56.  When EPA reviewed the 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, EPA found that \ncoal-fired power plants that burn lignite coal were disproportionately emitting high levels of \nmercury. Lignite coal contains more mercury than other coal types and is the least efficient type \nof coal to burn for energy. In 2021, 16 of the top 20 mercury-emitting coal-fired units burned \nlignite coal. In 2021, lignite coal-fired units were responsible for 30% of all mercury emissions \n18\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 19 of 58\nfrom coal-fired units but only 7% of total energygenerated by coal-fired units. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n38,537.\n57. The2024 Rule revised the 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards to further \nrestrict pollution from coal-fired power plants. The 2024 Rule set forth four standards and \nrequirements relevant here (hereinafter referred to as the “four requirements of the 2024 Rule”): \na. Modernized lignite mercury standard: First, EPA lowered limits on mercury \nemissions from power plants burning lignite coal to require them to meet the more \nprotective standard that already applies to power plants burning all other types of \ncoal. EPA lowered the mercury limit from 4 lb/TBtu2 to 1.2 lb/TBtu.  \nb. Modernized arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard: Second, EPA lowered \nlimits for arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals from all coal-fired power plants \nfrom 0.030 lb/MMBtu3 fPM to 0.010 lb/MMBtu fPM.EPA uses filterable \nparticulate matter (fPM) as a surrogate for toxic metals.\nc.  Modernized continuous emissions monitoring systems requirement: Third, EPA \nrequired coal-fired power plants to demonstrate compliance with the arsenic, \nnickel, and other toxic metals standard using continuous emissions monitoring \nsystems that provide continuous feedbackand real-time information about \nemission levels.Under the 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards,coal-fired \npowerplants could demonstrate compliancewith the standards through infrequent \nstack testingof emission levels only four times per year.EPA found it had \nauthority to require continuous emissions monitoring systems under 42 U.S.C. \n \n2 TBtu is an abbreviation for one trillion British thermal units. British thermal unit is a traditional \nunit of energy.\n3 MMbtu is an abbreviation for one million British thermal units.\n19\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 20 of 58\n§7412(d)(6) and separately under 42 U.S.C. § 7414. EPA found authority under \nSection 7412(d)(6) because it “further[ed]Congress’s goal [in Section 7412] to \nensure that emission reductions are consistently maintained” by “provid[ing] real-\ntime information to owners and operators (who can promptly address any \nproblems with emissions control equipment)” and “to regulators, to adjacent \ncommunities, and to the general public.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,535. EPA found \nauthority under Section 7414because it allowsEPA to require applicable facilities \nto “install, use, and maintain such monitoring equipment” on a “one-time, \nperiodic or continuous basis.” Id.  \nd.  Strengthened startup standard: Fourth, EPAremoved an extended startup \ncompliance option that allowed coal-fired power plants to delay compliance with \nnumerical emissions limits, and instead comply only with less stringent work \npractice requirements, for up to four hours after units begin generating electricity. \nRemoving the extended startup compliance option left only one startup \ncompliance option in place, which required power plants to meet numerical \nemission limits more quickly. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,551. This change had the effect \nof requiring all coal-fired power plants to meet a stricter startup standardand \nwouldtherefore lowerhazardous pollutant emissions. Id. \n58. Each of the four requirements of the 2024 Rule is independently achievable. EPA \nexplained that “a source can abide by any one of these individual requirements without abiding \nby any others. Thus, the EPA’s overall approach to this source category continues to be fully \nimplementable even in the absence of any one or more of the elements included in this final \nrule.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,519. \n20\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 21 of 58\n59. The 2024 Rule went into effect on July 8, 2024. Regulated power plants were \nrequired to comply with the strengthened startupstandard by January 2, 2025. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n38,519, 38,564. Regulated power plants are required to comply with the modernized lignite \nmercury standard, arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard, and continuous emissions \nmonitoring requirement by three years after the effective date (the maximum allowed by statute) \non July 6, 2027.  Id. at 38,564 (see regulatory text). \n60.  On information and belief, no coal-fired power plant has requested a compliance \nextension of up to one additional year available under 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(3) “if such additional \nperiod is necessary for the installation of controls.” \n61.  EPA projected that the 2024 Rule would reduce annual emissions of mercury by \n900 to 1,000 pounds starting in 2028. EPA projected that the 2024 Rule would reduce emissions \nof arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals by about four to seven tons per year. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n38,561. From 2028-2037, the 2024 Rule was expected to reduce 9,500 pounds of mercury and 49 \ntons of arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals. The 2024 Rule is expected to yield $79 million in \nmonetizable health benefits in 2028 alone, even without considering the benefits from reductions \nof mercury and toxic metals that EPA was unable to quantify. \n62. EPA alsoprojected that requiring the use of continuous emissions monitoring \nsystems would deliver non-monetizable benefits such as increased transparency, compliance \nassurance, and faster identification of pollution exceedances allowing operators to act more \nquickly to address problems and come back into compliance with standards.\nB. The Availability of Technology to Implement the 2024 Rule’s Modernized Standards \n63. Technology to implement the four requirements of the2024 Rule is available.\n21\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 22 of 58\n64. The pollution control technologies sufficient to meet the lower emissions \nstandards consist of technologies such as fabric filters and electrostatic precipitators to meet the \nstandard for arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals, and activated carbon injection systems to \nmeet the mercury standard. Those pollution control technologies are and have been widely used \nby many coal-fired electric generating units.  \n65.  Different power plants may apply different configurations and combinations of \ncontrol technologies and operational methods in order to comply with emission standards.  \n66.  EPA determined that the four requirements of the 2024 Rule are achievable for at \nleast two reasons. First, EPA determined they are achievable because coal-fired power plants \nwere demonstrating the ability to meet the requirements eventually adopted by the 2024 Rule \nbased on their emissions performance to comply with the 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics \nStandards. Second, EPA determined they are achievable because the compliance costs were \nreasonable. For requirements to be achievable, the technology to implement the requirements \nmust be available. \n67.  The technology needed for lignite-fired coal power plants to implement the lignite \nmercury standard, which may include activated carbon injection, fuel additives, scrubber \nchemicals, and equipment such as blowers, carbon metering valves, and sorbent storage vessels, \nis available. \n68.  The 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards carved out lignite-fired coal power \nplants for a higher mercury emissions limit than all other coal-fired power plants. In the 2024 \nRule, EPA determined that these 22 lignite-fired coal units could meet the same mercury limit as \nthe rest of the fleet because the mercury control technologies they were already using to meet \nexisting standards are “dial up” operational methods, allowing the operator to dial the controls \n22\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 23 of 58\n“up or down to achieve a desired [mercury] emission rate.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,540. Two lignite \nunits—Twin Oaks units 1 and 2 located in Texas—were already voluntarily emitting at low \nlevels (1.24 lb/TBtu and 1.31 lb/TBtu) near the new limit adopted by the 2024 Rule (1.2 \nlb/TBtu). Id.at 38,539.\n69. EPAacknowledged that the chemical composition of lignite coal, including low \nhalogen content and high sulfur content, created certain challenges for controlling mercury \nemissions. However, EPA determined that these compositional challenges were not unique and\nother non-lignite plants had demonstrated the ability to address these issues and meetthelower \nmercury limit that lignite plants would now be subject to. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,546-47, 38,549. \nEPA found that the advanced sorbents and chemical additives used to control mercury emissions \nat lignite-fired plants were “commercially available” from several vendors. Id. at 38,539, 38,541. \n70.  EPA stated that lignite coal plants have never been required to meet a lower \nmercury emission level and therefore had no incentive to incur the greater operating costs \nrequired to “dial up” their controls. EPA concluded: “Most units that are permitted to meet a \n[mercury] emission standard of 4.0 lb/TBtu have no reason to ‘over control’ since doing so by \ninjecting more sorbent would increase their operating costs. So, it is unsurprising that many units \nthat are permitted to fire lignite have reported [mercury] emission rates between 3.0 and 4.0.” 89 \nFed. Reg. 38,540. \n71.  The technology for coal-fired power plants to implement the arsenic, nickel, and \nother metals standard, which may include electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters, and operations \nand maintenance changes, is available.  \n23\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 24 of 58\n72. Coal-fired power plants providing 93% of the total energy capacity generatedby \nthe coal power plant fleet have already metthe standard for arsenic, nickel, and other metals \nadopted by the 2024 Rule with their existing technology. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,522, 38,530. \n73.  The fact that the overwhelming majority of coal-fired power plants are already \nmeeting the arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard demonstrates that the technology needed \nto meet the standard is available. \n74.  After EPA found that most power plants were emitting well below the standard \nadopted in the 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the agencydetermined that it was \nnecessary to update the arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard to require that the worst-\nperforming units in the fleet achieve emissions levels in linewith what the vast majority of other \nunits were proving to be achievable due to developments in control technologies following the \n2012 standards. This was consistent with Section 7412(d)’s mandate that standards reflect the \nmaximum degree of reduction in emissions that is achievable. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,522,38,530.\n75.  EPA estimated that very fewpowerplants would require upgrades to comply with \nthe new lower limit on arsenic, nickel, and other metals. Only 33 of 296 coal-fired units would \nneed to take action to meet the arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,530. \nEPA, Presentation: Final National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal and \nOil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units Review of the Residual Risk and Technology \nReview, at 12 (Apr. 25, 2024), https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-\n04/presentation_mats_final-2024-4-24-2024.pdf (attached as Exhibit 3).Of these 33 units,EPA \nestimated that 20 units would require no new capital investments but only modifications to their \nexisting technology. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,522, 38,530.  \n24\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 25 of 58\n76. Continuous emissions monitoring technology needed to implement the continuous \nemissions monitoring requirement is available.\n77. One-third of the coal-fired fleet—over 100 units—hasalready installed the \nrequired continuous emissions monitoring systems. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,535.  \n78.  EPA found in the 2024 Rule that technology to implement continuous emissions \nmonitoring for compliance demonstration was “readily available and in widespread use by the \nelectric utility industry.” Id. at 38,536.  \n79.  Technology sufficient to implement the strengthened startup standard is also \navailable.  \n80.  Technology and practices sufficient to implement the strengthened startup \nstandard includes “greater clean fuel capacity, better tuned equipment, better trained staff, a more \nefficient/better design structure, or a combination of factors.” Id. at 38,551.  \n81.  As of the promulgation of the 2024 Rule, the overwhelming majority of coal-fired \npower plants—generating over 98% of energy generated by the entire coal-fired power plant \nfleet—were already meeting the more stringent startup compliance option available under the \n2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Id.  \n82.  Only eight coal-fired units were using the more lax extended startup standard that \nthe 2024 Rule removed. These units are Prairie State Generating (Units 1 and 2) (Illinois), Brame \nEnergy Center (Units 2, 3-1, and 3-2) (Louisiana), Sherburne (Unit 3) (Minnesota), Westwood \n(Unit 1) (Pennsylvania), and Centralia (BW22) (Washington). 88 Fed. Reg. 24,854-85. These \nunits were required to comply with the strengthened startup standard starting on January 2, 2025. \nAll other coal-fired units had already been using the strengthened startup standard even prior to \nthe 2024 Rule. \n25\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 26 of 58\n83. The fact that all other coal-fired power plants have already implemented the 2024 \nRule’s startup standard demonstrates that the technology to meet the strengthened startup \nstandard is available.  \n84.  The costs are reasonable for operators to obtain or maintain the control \ntechnologies needed to comply with the 2024 Rule.  \n85.  For the lignite mercury standard, EPA determined that the improved operational \nmethods needed—injecting more activated carbon sorbent—represented just “a small fraction \nof” the revenues of the affected lignite-fired coal units. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,549. \n86.  The annual costs to meet the arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard are a small \nfraction of power sector expenditures and a very small share of total power sector sales. 89 Fed. \nReg. at 38,533. EPA determined these costs were “much lower” than estimated in the original \n2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Id. at 38,531. Only 33 of 296 coal-fired units would \nneed to make upgrades or install new technology to comply with the modernized arsenic, nickel, \nand other metals standard. Twenty of those 33 units would incur costs of at most $100,000 a year \nper coal-fired unit. Those implementation costs are a small fraction of the power sector’s annual \nelectricity revenues, which in 2022 were $427.8 billion. Id. at 38,532-34.  \n87.  Implementing the continuous emissions monitoring systems requirement costs \nabout $72,000 per year per coal-fired unit. That is about $12,000 greater per year than the cost of \nquarterly emissions performance tests allowed under the 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics \nStandards. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,535-36.  \n88.  Implementing the strengthened startup standard would require little to no \nadditional expenditures by coal-fired units. The strengthened startup standard has simplified \n26\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 27 of 58\nreporting and recordkeeping requirements, which can decrease compliance costs. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n38,551.  \n89. EPA studied the impacts of the 2024 Rule and determined its implementation \nwould not cause any coal-fired power plant to retire, would have no significant impact on retail \nelectricity prices, and would not cause any significant challenges to existing resource \nadequacy—that is, the power system’s ability to meet electricity demand. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,526, \n38,556.  \n90.  Units that must achieve additional pollution reductions to comply with the four \nrequirements of the 2024 Rule are forecast to produce just 2% of electricity generated in 2028. \n89 Fed Reg. at 38,555.  \n91.  As EPA noted, concerns about the reliability of the power grid were raised in \nconnection with the 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics \nStandards required far greater action and investments by the coal-fired power plant fleet to \nimplement than the 2024 Rule. To date there is no evidence that the 2012 Mercury and Air \nToxics Standards contributed to problems with the U.S. power grid’s ability to meet energy \ndemand. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,527.  \nC.  Litigation Challenging the 2024 Rule and Coal Industry Requests to Stay the Rule \n92.  A number of coal industry participants filed petitions for review of the 2024 Rule \nin the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Coal industry Petitioners and \nassociated Petitioner-Intervenors also filed emergency applications to stay the 2024 Rule \npremised on claims of irreparable injury should they be required to comply with the rule or take \nactions to prepare for compliance with the rule before the litigation in the case resolved and the \npotential for disruptions to the U.S. power grid should power plants be forced to shut down. The \n27\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 28 of 58\nD.C. Circuit denied the motions to stay the rule. Order in North Dakota v. EPA, No. 24-1119 \n(D.C. Cir., Aug. 6, 2024) (attached as Exhibit 4).  \n93.  Petitioners and Petitioner-Intervenors then filed stay applications in the Supreme \nCourt raising similar arguments that they would suffer irreparable injury from the costs of \nactions taken to prepare for rule compliance during the pendency of litigation. The Court denied \nthose applications. Docket Order in North Dakota v. EPA, No. 24A180 (D.C. Cir., Oct. 4, 2024) \n(attached as Exhibit 5).  \n94.  The case was fully briefed on the merits when the D.C. Circuit granted EPA’s \nrequest that the case be held in abeyance pending the agency’s reconsideration of the 2024 Rule. \nOrder in North Dakota v. EPA, No. 24-1119 (D.C. Cir., Feb. 20, 2025) (attached as Exhibit 6). No \nparty challenged the 2024 Rule’s strengthened startup standard, nor EPA’s assertion of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7414(a)(1)(C) as additional authority to require continuous emissions monitoring systems to \ndemonstrate compliance with the arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard. \nD.   The Trump Administration’s Announcement That It Was Reconsidering the 2024 \nRule and Invitation to Apply for Presidential Exemptions   \n \n95.  On March 12, 2025, EPA announced that it would “reconsider” the 2024 Rule—\ntogether with 31 other federal regulations protecting human health and the environment. EPA, \nNews Release, Trump EPA to Reconsider Biden-Harris MATS Regulation That Targeted Coal-\nFired Power Plants to be Shut Down (Mar. 12, 2025), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-\nepa-reconsider-biden-harris-mats-regulation-targeted-coal-fired-power-plants-be. EPA \nAdministrator Lee Zeldin called it “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.”  EPA, \nNews Release, EPA Launches Biggest Deregulatory Action in U.S. History (Mar. 12, 2025), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history.  \n28\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 29 of 58\n96. EPA announced on that day that: “The Trump Administration is considering a 2-\nyear compliance exemption via Section [7412](i)(4) of the Clean Air Act for affected power \nplants while EPA goes through the rulemaking process.” Id.\n97.  EPA published a “fact sheet” on the reconsideration of the 2024 Rule that stated\nthat: “Any source interested in a Presidential exemption, should provide their recommendations \nto EPA by March 31, 2025. Sources need only provide why technology is unavailable and why it \nis in the national security interests of the United States to provide the exemption.” EPA, Mercury \nand Air Toxics Standards (MATS): Powering the Great American Comeback Fact Sheet\n(undated), at https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-03/fact-sheet-reconsideration-\nof-mercury-and-air-toxics-standards.pdf. \n98. The fact sheet provided reasons for the reconsideration of the 2024 Rule—none of \nwhich were that the technology needed for power plants to comply with the rule was not \navailable. Instead, the fact sheet citedreasons relating to a changed interpretation of Clean Air \nAct authority,costs to power plants and operators, and a concernthe 2024 Rulecreated an\n“undue burden” on certain coal plants. Id.\n99. That same day, EPA announced reconsideration of eight otherSection7412 rules \nlimiting hazardous air pollution from various industrial sectors including integrated iron and steel \nmanufacturing, rubber tire manufacturing, synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry, \ncommercial sterilizers for medical devices and spices, lime manufacturing, coke ovens, copper \nsmelting, and taconite ore processing. EPA stated that the Trump Administration was also\nconsidering 2-year compliance exemptions for facilities subject to these standards “while EPA \ngoes through the rulemaking process” and invited sources to “provide their recommendations to \nEPA by March 31, 2025” to procure an exemption. SeeEPA, Trump EPA Announces \n29\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 30 of 58\nReconsideration of Air Rules Regulating American Energy, Manufacturing, Chemical Sectors \n(NESHAPs) (Mar. 12, 2025), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-\nreconsideration-air-rules-regulating-american-energy-manufacturing; EPA, National Emission \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), Powering the Great American Comeback \nFact Sheet, https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-03/neshap_powering-the-great-\namerican-comeback fact-sheet 2.pdf. \n100. Onor about March 24, 2025, EPA posted a new webpagewithdetails onhow \nfacilities could submit requests for presidential exemptions from compliance with the nine \nSection 7412 rules—including the 2024 Rule—previously identified as being reconsidered.EPA, \nClean Air Section 112 Presidential Exemption Information (last updated Apr. 14, 2025), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/clean-air-act-section-112-presidential-\nexemption-information.(attached as Exhibit 7).The webpage explained,“EPA set up an \nelectronic mailbox to allow the regulated community to request a Presidential Exemption under \nsection [7412](i)(4)” and providedrequesters an email address—airaction@epa.gov—to submit \nrequests “by March 31, 2025.” Id. EPA has since removed much of the information in an April \n14, 2025 updateto the webpage. EPA did not ask for any information from the general public or \naffected communities or otherwise invite their input on issuing exemptions.\n101. On information and belief, a presidential administration has only once previously\nestablished a process for the consideration of whether the President might provideexemptions \nfrom a national emissions standard for hazardous air pollutants, forfacilities that sterilize \nmedical products.The process for consideration of and granting such exemptions was set forth in \na presidential memorandum. Memorandum on the Orderly Implementation of the Air Toxics \nStandards for Ethylene Oxide Commercial Sterilizers, 90 Fed. Reg. 6,773 (Jan. 17, 2025)\n30\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 31 of 58\n(“Sterilizers Memorandum”).On information and belief, no exemptions were granted as a result \nof this process.\n102. ThePresident stated in theSterilizers Memorandum that the exemption process \nwas intended to address “the exceptional circumstances in which a commercial sterilizer can \ndemonstrate that, notwithstanding due diligence and best efforts, it will be unable to meet a \ncovered standard or limitation required by the [] Rule before the compliance deadline due to the \nunavailability of control technology for the facility, leading to likely shutdown of the facility, and \nthe best available information demonstrates that the shutdown of the facility will likely lead to a \nserious disruption to the supply of medical products, such as medical devices and \npharmaceuticals, necessary for America’s national security and public health.” 90 Fed. Reg. at \n6,774. \n103. ThePresident made clear in the Sterilizers Memorandum that issuing an \nexemption is a last resort reserved for when “notwithstanding its due diligence and best efforts, \nthe facility cannot be brought into compliance before the compliance deadline for the covered \nstandard or limitation.” Id. \nE.  President Trump Granted Exemptions from the 2024 Rule to 68 Coal-Fired Power \nPlants. \n \n  Release and Publication of the Exemption Proclamation and Annex 1 \n \n104. OnApril 8, 2025, President Trump issued aproclamation (the Exemption \nProclamation)that exempted “certain stationary sources . . . as identified in Annex I of this \nproclamation”from the 2024 Rulepursuant to “authority vested ... by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, including section [7412](i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 \nU.S.C 7412(i)(4).” Exemption Proclamation.  \n31\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 32 of 58\n105. In support of the exemptions, the Exemption Proclamation included what it \nreferred to as two “determinations.” Id.\n106. First, the Exemption Proclamation purported to “determine” that “[t]he \ntechnology to implement the Rule is not available.” Id. The Proclamation stated: that “[s]uch \ntechnology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of \nand compliance with the Rule by its compliance date of July 8, 2027.” Id. \n107.  Second, the Exemption Proclamation purported to “determine” that “[i]t is in the \nnational security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption” because the 2024 Rule \n“places severe burdens on coal-fired power plants” and the “viability of our Nation’s coal \nsector,” “requires compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control \ntechnologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form,” and provides a “compliance \ntimeline . . .  [that] therefore raises the unacceptable risk of the shutdown of many coal-fired \npower plants, eliminating thousands of jobs, placing our electrical grid at risk, and threatening \nbroader harmful economic and energy security effects . . . in turn undermin[ing] our national \nsecurity, as these effects would leave America vulnerable to electricity demand shortages, \nincreased dependence on foreign energy sources, and potential disruptions of our electricity and \nenergy supplies, particularly in times of crisis.” Id.  \n108.  The Exemption Proclamation declared that the exempted power plants “are \nexempt from compliance with the Rule for a period of 2 years beyond the Rule’s compliance \ndate—i.e., for the period beginning July 8, 2027, and concluding July 8, 2029 (Exemption).” Id. \n109.  The Exemption Proclamation asserts the compliance deadline of the 2024 Rule is \nJuly 8, 2027. That is wrong. The compliance deadline for the lignite mercury standard, the \nnickel, arsenic, and other metals standard, and the continuous emissions monitoring systems \n32\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 33 of 58\nrequirement is July 6, 2027.The compliance deadline for the 2024 Rule’s startup standard was \nJanuary 2, 2025. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,564.  \n110. The Exemption Proclamation purports to exempt sources from compliance with \nthe 2024 Rule for a period that extends beyond two years from the date ofthe purported \n“determination” ontechnological availability and national security.  \n111. The Exemption Proclamation stated that,“during this 2-year period [from July 8, \n2027, to July 8, 2029], these stationary sources are subject to the compliance obligations that \nthey are currently subject to under the [2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards] as [they] existed \nprior to the [2024] Rule.” Id.\n112. President Trump transmitted a notification of the exemptions to Congress, dated \nApril 14, 2025. H.R. Doc. No. 119-40, (2025). The Exemption Proclamation and “Annex 1”\nwere published in the Federal Register on April 21, 2025. 90 Fed. Reg. 16,777 (Apr. 21, 2025), \nwww.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-21/pdf/2025-06936.pdf. \n113. Plaintiff EDF submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to EPA seeking \ninformation about requests for exemptions from sources and their responses. To date, EDF has \nnot received any responsive documents. \n114. The White Househas sincehighlightedthe exemptions as an example of the \nPresident broadly“pausing restrictive emissions rules for coal plants.” See, e.g., White House, \nOn Earth Day, We Finally Have a President Who Follows the Science (Apr. 22, 2025), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/on-earth-day-we-finally-have-a-president-who-\nfollows-science. The same White House release stated that “President Trump is cutting wasteful \nregulations that stifle innovation and raise costs. Actions like pausing restrictive emissions rules \nfor coal plants . . . have accelerated responsible energy and infrastructure projects while \n33\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 34 of 58\nmaintaining rigorous environmental standards – saving American families thousands annually on \nenergy bills and proving that a strong economy and a healthy environment go hand-in-hand.” Id. \nEPA’s Proposed Repeal \n115. On June 11, 2025, Administrator Zeldin signed and submitted to the Office of the \nFederal Register for publication a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled, “Repeal of \nAmendments to National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired \nElectric Utility Steam Generating Units,” available at https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-\nair-pollution/mercury-and-air-toxics-standards. The notice proposes to repeal the modernized \nmercury standard, the modernized arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard, and the continuous \nemissions monitoring standard. \nFacts Relating to Power Plants That Received Exemptions\n116. Although the Exemption Proclamation issued on April 8, 2025 referenced an \n“Annex I” for the list of exempted power plants, the Proclamation as issued did not include an \n“Annex I.” Plaintiff EDF filed a Freedom of Information Act request with EPA and the White \nHouse Office of Management and Budget for “Annex I” on April 10. The “Annex I” list of\nexempted power plants was published for the first time on April 14, when EPA posted the \ndocument to its website. EPA, “Annex 1”4 (Apr.14, 2025)https://www.epa.gov/system/\nfiles/documents/2025-04/regulatory-relief-for-certain-stationary-annex-1.pdf  (providing list of \n68 exempted plants organized by operating company).\n \n4While the Exemptions Proclamation referred to an “Annex I” using the Roman numeral, the \ndocument itself as posted on EPA’s website and later in the Federal Register was titled “Annex \n1” using the Arabic numeral.  \n34\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 35 of 58\n117. The list revealed that the President had exempted 68 coal-fired power plants \nacross 23 states from the 2024 Rule. The exemptions cover approximately one-third of the entire \ndomestic coal fleet. \n118.  Annex 1 lists 47 power companies and identifies every “affected facility/source” \nowned by that power company granted an exemption. The document in some cases identifies \nspecific coal-fired units located at a specified facility receiving exemptions, but in other cases \nonly lists the facility itself. The total number of exempted coal-fired units is thus unspecified and \nunclear. \n119.  Some of the power plants that the Exemption Proclamation exempts are already \nable to meet the four requirements of the 2024 Rule with their existing controls. EPA determined \nthat these power plants do not need to install or upgrade any technology or make any changes to \noperations and maintenance to implement the 2024 Rule’s standards. For example, the H.L. \nSpurlock (Kentucky), R.S. Nelson (Louisiana), Sioux (Missouri), and Cooper (Kentucky) plants \nhave already installed the continuous emissions monitoring systems required by the 2024 Rule, \nare not affected by the lignite mercury standard because they do not burn lignite, are already \nmeeting the modernized arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard with their existing technology, \nand are already meeting the strengthened startup standard.    \n120. All but one of the exempted power plants (the Colstrip facility in Montana) are \nable to meet the modernized arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard with existing controls. See \nProposed Repeal at 23. Several otherexempted power plants, including D. B.Wilson(Ohio), \nMilton R.Young 2(North Dakota), Martin Lake 1 (Texas), San Miguel (Texas), Mt. Storm (West \nVirginia), and Laramie River 3 (Wyoming) already have the necessary control technology to \nmeet the modernized arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard and would only need to \n35\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 36 of 58\nimplement operations and maintenance changes to comply with the 2024 Rule’s modernized \narsenic, nickel, and other metals standard. \n121.  Some exempted power plants would need to upgrade their existing pollution \ncontrols with commercially available equipment to comply with the 2024 Rule’s standard for \narsenic, nickel, and other metals. Colstrip(Montana), Labadie (Missouri), and Harrison (West \nVirginia) need to invest in fabric filters or electrostatic precipitators to meet the modernized \narsenic, nickel, and other metals standard. John B. Rich (Pennsylvania) and Westwood \n(Pennsylvania) need a bag-type upgrade to their existing fabric filters to meet the modernized \narsenic, nickel, and other metals standard.  \n122.  Only 10 of the coal plants exempted by the Exemption Proclamation are lignite-\nfired: Antelope Valley (ND), Coal Creek (ND), Coyote (ND), Leland Olds (ND), Limestone \n(TX), Martin Lake (TX), Milton R. Young (ND), Oak Grove (TX), Red Hills Generating Facility \n(MS), and San Miguel (TX). All 10 of the lignite-fired coal plants exempted by the Exemption \nProclamation are already using some form of sorbent or activated carbon injection system to \ncontrol emissions. Those 10 facilities have thus installed the technology necessary to meet the \n2024 Rule’s modernized mercury standard and would only need to change some aspects of the \noperation of that technology to further control mercury emissions sufficient to meet the 2024 \nRule’s modernized mercury standard. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,547-49.  \n123.  At least 42 of the 68 coal-fired plants exempted by the Exemption Proclamation \nare already using fabric filters and electrostatic precipitators and have been meeting, on average, \nthe levels of the arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard of the 2024 Rule.  \n124.  Eleven of the 68 coal-fired power plants exempted by the Exemption \nProclamation already have continuous emissions monitoring systems installed.  \n36\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 37 of 58\n125. Two of the coal-fired power plants exempted by the Exemption Proclamation \nwere previously using the extended startup compliance option and have been required to use the \nstrengthened startup standard in the 2024 Rule beginning in January 2025. These plants are \nRausch Creek Generation/Westwood (Pennsylvania) and Brame Energy Center (Unit 2) \n(Louisiana). All other exempted power plants were already using the strengthened startup \nstandard to comply.  \nLackof Source-Specific Determinations Made by the President\n126. The Exemption Proclamation does not reveal any factual consideration or \ndeliberation of the statutory prerequisites for granting a Section 7412(i)(4) exemption. Readily \ndiscernible facts reveal that the statutory prerequisites are not met.  \n127.  The President has not, in the Exemption Proclamation, Annex 1, or (on \ninformation and belief) otherwise, for any power plants granted exemptions, made a source-\nspecific determination that “the technology to implement” each (or any) of the 2024 Rule’s \nrequirements “is not available” for that specific power plant or any of the coal-fired units at that \npower plant. \n128. The Exemption Proclamation states without explanation, analysis, basis, or \nspecificity that “[t]he technology to implement the Rule is not available” and “does not exist in a \ncommercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the Rule by \nits compliance date of July 8, 2027.” This statement is not a determinationthat the technology to \ncomply with each requirement is unavailable for each of the exempted power plants.\n129. The Exemption Proclamation states “the technology to implement the Rule is not \navailable.”The Exemption Proclamation does not specify which technology is not available. The \nExemption Proclamation does not specifyforwhich of the four requirements ofthe 2024 Rule \n37\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 38 of 58\nthe technology to implement such requirement is not available.Each of the four requirements \ndepends on implementing distinct technologies. \n130. The President has not, in the Exemption Proclamation, Annex 1, or (on \ninformation and belief) otherwise made any determination that any of the power plants listed on \nAnnex 1 will shut down if required to comply with the 2024 Rule.  \n131. The President has not, in the Exemption Proclamation, Annex 1, or (on \ninformation and belief) otherwise made any determination that the retirement or shutdown of any \nof the plants listed on Annex 1 would pose national security risks to the United States. The \nExemption Proclamation declares “[t]he current compliance timeline of the Rule therefore raises \nthe unacceptable risk of the shutdown of many coal-fired power plants,” but does not say which \npower plants are at risk of shutting down or assert thatany of the power plants listed in Annex 1\nare at “unacceptable risk of shutdown.” The President has not, in the Exemption Proclamation, \nAnnex 1, or (on information and belief) otherwise made any determination for each power plant \ngranted an exemption (1) that the technology is not available for it to comply with the 2024 Rule, \n(2) that the plant will retire as a result, or (3) that such retirement would pose a national security \nthreat. \n132.  The President has not, in the Exemption Proclamation, Annex 1, or (on \ninformation and belief) otherwise made any determination as to the individual exempted plants \nand the different requirements from which they necessitated an exemption.  \n133.  The Exemption Proclamation exempts power plants from having to comply with \nthe strengthened startup standard from July 8, 2027 to July 8, 2029 after they have been subject \nto compliance with the standard from January 2, 2025 to July 7, 2027. This illogic underscores\n38\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 39 of 58\nthe absence of a fact-based determination made about the availability of technology to \nimplement the 2024 Rule over any particular time period. \n134.  In the alternative, if the exemptionfrom the strengthened startup standard were to \napply immediately to power plants, it would provide an exemption for over four years, when 42 \nU.S.C. § 7412(i)(4) allows the President to issue a single exemption “of not more than 2 years.”\n135. Similarly, the Exemption Proclamation’s erroneous assertion that the compliance \ndeadline of the 2024 Rule is July 8, 2027, rather than July 6, 2027, means the terms of the \nproclamation may require sources to install controls and comply with the 2024 Rule’s \nrequirements for two days in July 2027 before sources are exempted. This illogic underscores the \nabsence of a determination about the availability of technology over any particular time period. \n136. The Exemption Proclamation granted Brame Energy Center Unit 2 an exemption \nfrom the 2024 Rule for the period from July 8, 2027, to July 8, 2029. Brame Energy Center Unit \n2 is one of the few coal-fired units that was previously not in compliance with the 2024 Rule’s \nstartup standard.Brame Energy Center Unit 2, like all other coal-fired units subject to the 2024 \nRule, was required to comply with the more stringent startup standard starting January 2, 2025. \nOn its face, if the Exemption Proclamation exempts sources from compliance with the startup \nstandard, it would mean that Brame Energy Center Unit 2 will be exempt from that standard \nfrom July 8, 2027, to July 8, 2029. And it would mean that Brame Energy Center Unit 2 will \neither need to procure and use technological controls before July 8, 2027, to comply with the \nstrengthened startup standard—or be in noncompliance with the 2024 Rule—but then be \npermitted to not use such technological controls from July 8, 2027, to July 8, 2029 due to a \nPresidential determination that such technology is “not available” to achieve compliance during \nthat later period. This belies an assertion that the technology to implement the startup standard is \n39\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 40 of 58\nnot available and demonstrates that there was no determination made as to theavailability of \ntechnology necessary for Brame Energy Center Unit 2 to implement the strengthened startup \nstandard. \n137.  Similarly, the factual allegations supra at ¶¶ 119, 121, 122-125, that the \nExemption Proclamation exempts coal-fired power plants from requirements of the 2024 Rule \nthat they are already in compliance with demonstrates that there was no determination made \nabout the availability of technology for exempted sources to implement the 2024 Rule. \nFacts Contradicting the Exemption Proclamation \n138. The facts alleged supra at ¶¶ 63-93 demonstrate that the technology to implement \nthe 2024 Rule is available and that compliance with the 2024 Rule will not cause any power \nplant to retire. \n139.  The Exemption Proclamation’s determination that technology is not “available” is \ncontradicted by the fact that all of the different technologies necessary to implement the 2024 \nRule, such as continuous emission monitoring systems, are already installed and in use by \nexisting coal-fired power plants. As explained supra ¶¶ 119, 121, 122-125, several of the \nexempted power plants already have installed the technology necessary to comply with the 2024 \nRule. \n140. The Exemption Proclamation directly contradicts the findings made by EPA just \n11 months earlier, on the basis ofan ample administrative record developed through public \nnotice and comment, that the control technologies needed to implement each of the four \nrequirements of the 2024 Rule are availableand cost reasonable, and that each of the four \nrequirements of the 2024 Rule are achievable. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,533, 38,535-36, \n38,539.\n40\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 41 of 58\n141. EPA found that the 2024 Rule will not drive any coal plant retirements, and that \nthe 2024 Rule can be implemented without interfering with electric system reliability or resource \nadequacy. The Exemption Proclamation directly contradicts those findings, made just 11 months \nearlier. \n142.  Since the time the 2024 Rule was finalized, upon information and belief, no unit \nhas publicly indicated that it intends to shut down as a result of the 2024 Rule.  \n143.  Since President Trump issued the Exemption Proclamation, certain power plant \nowners and operators who did not receive an exemption have publicly shared that they did not \nrequest an exemption. One power plant operator stated: “The 2024 MATS rule does not impact \nour ability to continue to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers while \ncontinuing to comply with environmental regulations.” Morgan Watkins, Why two Kentucky \nutilities sought coal pollution exemption from Trump, but others didn’t, Louisville Public Media \n(Apr. 29, 2025), https://www.lpm.org/investigate/2025-04-29/why-two-kentucky-utilities-sought-\ncoal-pollution-exemption-from-trump-but-others-didnt. Another power plant operator said: \n“After careful consideration of the statutory requirements necessary to seek a presidential \nexemption, Duke Energy determined that it was in the best interest of our customers not to seek \nan (exemption).” Id.The fact that certain power plant owners and operators did not request an \nexemption illustrates how technology is available to implement the 2024 Rule’s requirements.\nSTANDING\n144. Plaintiffs’ members live, work, and recreate in areas affected by the excess \npollution that is and will be emitted from the exempted coal-fired power plants. Members are \nharmed by breathing in air pollution from the exempted plants. Members are concerned that \nexposure to pollution from the exempted plants could have harmful impacts on their health. \n41\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 42 of 58\nExposure to mercury, particulate matter, and arsenic, nickel, and other heavy metals emitted at \nhigher volumes by exempted plants as a result of the Exemption Proclamation has adverse health \neffects, which may include cancer, kidney damage, and detrimental effects to the central nervous \nsystem.5\n145. Plaintiffs’ members are also harmed by exposure to excess mercury when \nconsuming fish contaminated with power plant mercury. Coal plant mercury emissions can travel\nthrough the air before being deposited on land or in waterbodies. Once deposited into \nwaterbodies, microbial action can turn mercury into methylmercury. Methylmercury can be \ntaken up by aquatic organisms and bioaccumulate in larger, longer-living organisms that eat \nsmaller organisms. Humans are exposed when they eat fish with high concentrations of \nmethylmercury. Exposure to methylmercury from fish consumption causes adverse health \neffects, including neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular harms. 89 Fed. Reg. at 38,515. Birds \nand mammals can also become exposed via fish consumption and face resulting adverse health \neffects.\n146. Plaintiffs’ members are concerned that air pollution from the exempted power \nplants is present in the locations where they live, work, and recreate. These reasonable concerns \nabout their increased exposure to air pollution while engaged in those activities and other \nresulting harms from that exposure diminish their enjoyment of outdoor activities and areas they \npreviously enjoyed or would like to continue to engage in or use, thereby harming members’ \n \n5 EPA, Fact Sheet: EPA’s Final Rule to Strengthen and Update the Mercury and Air Toxics \nStandards for Power Plants at 4, https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/fact-\nsheet_mats-rtrfinal_ rule_2024.pdf; see also National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air \nPollutants: Coal-and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units—Revocation of the \n2020 Reconsideration and Affirmation of the Appropriate and Necessary Supplemental Finding, \n88 Fed. Reg. 13,956 (Mar. 6, 2023). \n42\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 43 of 58\naesthetic and recreational interests. Some members are aware that mercury and other heavy \nmetals can contaminate animals and are concerned about the safety of eating the fish they catch \nand animals they hunt in the areas affected by the exempted plants. Some members fish \nrecreationally but curtail their fishing or refrain from fishing, or avoid eating the fish they catch, \nbecause of mercury advisories or other concerns about the mercury content of fish.  \n147. Plaintiffs’ members benefit from stronger controls on power plants in a variety of \nways, including through reduced exposure to pollution, cleaner air and environment, reduced \ncontamination of fish and game, and a greater ability to enjoy outdoor activities in areas affected \nby the power plants. \n148. Some of Plaintiffs’ members live, work, fish, hunt, or recreate near power plants \nthat are exempted from complying with the strengthened standard for arsenic, nickel, and other \ntoxic metals beginning on July 8, 2027. Compliance with the strengthened standard will reduce \nhealth-harming pollution, including particulate matter and heavy metals. Exempting power plants \nfrom the strengthened standard injures those members by delaying or denying them the benefits \nof stronger pollution controls. \n149. Some of Plaintiffs’ members live, work, fish, hunt, or recreate near lignite-fired \npower plants that are exempted from complying with the strengthened mercury standards \nbeginning onJuly 8, 2027. Compliance with the strengthened standard will reduce mercury \npollution. Exempting power plants from the strengthened standard injures those members by \ndelaying or denying them the benefits of stronger pollution controls. \n150. Some of Plaintiffs’ members live, work, or recreate near power plants that are \nexempted from the requirement to employ continuous emissions monitoring for the strengthened \nstandard for arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals beginning on July 8, 2027. Requiring \n43\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 44 of 58\ncontinuous emissions monitoring can result in reduced pollution and strengthened compliance \nthrough faster identification and correction of problems with pollution control devices. 89 Fed. \nReg. at 38,508, 38,536. EPA recognized those benefits in its 2024 rulemaking. Continuous \nemissions monitoring will also generate up-to-date information for Plaintiffs, their members, and \nthe public about particulate matter and toxic metal emissions at the power plants.  \n151.  Exempting power plants from the requirement to employ continuous emissions \nmonitoring injures members by delaying or denying them the pollution reduction and improved \ncompliance that can result from continuous monitoring. The exemptions also deny Plaintiffs and \ntheir members the information about emissions at the power plants that continuous emissions \nmonitoring would provide. Sources that are major under Clean Air Act Section 7412, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7412, are subject to the Clean Air Act’s Title V permitting requirements. Title V requires that \n“a copy of each permit application, compliance plan including the schedule of compliance), \nemissions or compliance monitoring report, certification, and each permit . . . shall be available \nto the public.” 42 U.S.C. § 7661b(e). Some Plaintiffs and their members would use such \nmonitoring data to raise public awareness of air pollution and to further Plaintiffs’ and their \nmembers’ advocacy, education, and outreach efforts to reduce air pollution. For example, it can \nallow Plaintiffs and their members to better identify violations and act when the data shows a \npower plant has not complied with pollution standards. It would also help the communities some \nPlaintiffs serve make educated decisions about how they engage in advocacy to reduce air \npollution. And improved monitoring data empowers Plaintiffs, their members, and the \ncommunities they work with to better understand their own pollution exposures so that they can \nmodify their behavior to limit their exposure to pollution from coal power plants. Without \ncontinuous emissions monitoring data, Plaintiffs and their members will be unable to improve \n44\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 45 of 58\ntheir advocacy and public education work, and some members will be deprived of information \nthey could have used to evaluate the pollution exposure and health risks of areas affected by the \nexempted power plants and make decisions to reduce their exposure.\n152. Some of Plaintiffs’ members live, work, or recreate in areas near power plants that \nare exempted from the requirement to comply with more stringent startup standards, for which \ncompliance was required starting on January 2, 2025. Compliance with the strengthened standard \nwill reduce mercury and other toxic air pollution. Exempting power plants from the strengthened \nstandard injures those members by delaying or denying them the benefits of stronger pollution \ncontrols. \n153. Power plants that were issued exemptions are now able to emit toxic air pollution \nat higher levels during the period of exemption than otherwise would have been allowed. They \nare also able to forgo use of continuous emissions monitoring during the period of exemption. \nPower plants that may have already been complying with the strengthened standards of the 2024 \nRule will now have no legal obligation to do so during the period of exemption. They will be \npermitted to stop using already-installed pollution control technologies and raise their emissions, \nsignificantly increasing the risk to Plaintiffs and their members of exposure to increased \nemissions and the health harms associated with such exposures.  \n154. A coal industry group stated that the 2024 Rule will require coal power plants to \ntake immediate actions and make immediate expenditures to be able to meet the rule’s \nrequirements by the compliance deadline.\n155. Stephanie Coates is a member of the Environmental Defense Fund and works as a \nClimate & Health Project Manager for EDF. Ms. Coates lives in Houston with her family and \nenjoys spending time outdoors with her family, including biking and taking regular walks to the \n45\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 46 of 58\npark or coffee shop. She lives about 25 miles from the W.A. Parish Coal Plant. The W.A. Parish \ncoal plant needs to install CEMS to comply with the 2024 Rule. The Martin Lake coal plant, the \nOak Grove coal plant, and the San Miguel coal plant are located outside of Houston. All three \nplants are lignite-fired and must make operations changes to comply with the strengthened \nmercury standard. Martin Lake and San Miguel also need to invest in increased operations and \nmaintenance to meet the strengthened standard for arsenic, nickel, and other metals, and San \nMiguel needs to install CEMS to comply with the 2024 Rule. All four of those coal plants are \nexempted from compliance with the 2024 Rule by the Exemption Proclamation. Ms. Coates has \nconcerns about her exposure and her children’s exposure to mercury and other toxic emissions \nfrom those exempted coal plants, and the effect of such exposures on their health. Ms. Coates \nwas diagnosed with non-hereditary breast cancer and is concerned that toxic pollution from those \nexempted coal plants will exacerbate her health condition and detract from her quality of life. \nMs. Coates relies on public information about air quality to make decisions about the health risks \nof outdoor activities, and limits the time she and her children spend outdoors when air quality is \nunhealthy. Exemptions for W.A. Parish and other Houston-area coal plants deny her the more \ndetailed and regular information about coal plant emissions that would have otherwise been \navailable under the 2024 Rule. The exemptions also harm Ms. Coates and her family by \npermitting exempted coal plants to emit more pollution during the period of exemption than they \nwould otherwise emit. \n156.  Michelle L. Marley-Knox is a member of ELPC and has lived within thirty miles \nof the Kincaid power plant in Christian County, Illinois for her entire life. She enjoys outdoor \nrecreational activities near the Kincaid plant, including bicycling, camping, water activities, and \nfishing. In recent years, she has needed to stop fishing and swimming in the lakes near her home \n46\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 47 of 58\ndue to concerns over mercury pollution. Everyone in Ms. Marley-Knox's family suffers from a \nsusceptibility to bronchitis and must carry inhalers. The Kincaid plant was scheduled to close \ndown by the end of 2027 but has recently received an exemption from the 2024 Rule. It already \nhas the technology sufficient to implement the arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals standard of \nthe 2024 Rule. With the exemption, the Kincaid plant will no longer be required to implement or \nuse that technology and will be allowed to emit levels of pollution in excess of the 2024 standard \nbeginning in July 2027. Ms. Marley-Knox is also concerned that the Kincaid plant may remain \nopen longer than it had originally planned and continue to jeopardize her health, recreational, and \nbusiness interests. Further, Ms. Marley-Knox is concerned that the Kincaid plant will no longer \nbe required to conduct continuous monitoring and that the subsequent lack of up-to-date \nemissions information would prevent her from effectively evaluating the health risks she and her \nfamily are exposed to each day. \n157.  Derf Johnson, a lifelong resident of Montana, is a member of the Sierra Club and \nthe Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC), and a Deputy Director of MEIC. Mr. \nJohnson enjoys outdoor activities in Montana including hunting, fishing, swimming, and \nobserving wildlife. Mr. Johnson regularly visits the area around the Colstrip coal plant and has \ndefinite plans to return to the area. Annex 1 lists the Colstrip coal plant as exempted from \ncompliance with the 2024 Rule. Colstrip needs to install pollution controls to be able to achieve \nthe levels in the arsenic, nickel, and other metals standard of the 2024 Rule. Visible air pollution \nfrom the Colstrip coal plant and concerns about the health implications of air pollution degrade \nhis experience visiting southeastern Montana, where Colstrip is located. Mr. Johnson is aware \nthat the Colstrip coal plant emits mercury and other toxic metals, as well as particulate matter. He \nis concerned about exposure to the coal plant’s emissions and the resulting harm to his health. \n47\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 48 of 58\n158. Catherine Fleischman is a member of the Natural Resources Defense Council. She \nlives in Davis, West Virginia, in close proximity to the Mt. Storm Generating Station coal-fired \npower plant. Mt. Storm is listed in Annex 1 as exempted from the 2024 Rule. Mt. Storm already \nhas technology sufficient to implement the modernized arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals \nstandard and the continuous emissions monitoring standard of the 2024 Rule. Ms. Fleischman \nfrequently checks air quality information. She spends a significant amount of time outside in the \narea of the Mt. Storm plant and limits her outdoor activities when air quality is poor because she \nsuffers fatigue and lethargy from poor air quality.  She is concerned about the health effects from \nair quality degradation as a result of pollution from the Mt. Storm plant and frequently observes \nand smells plumes of pollution from Mt. Storm. \n159. Barbara Sue is a member of the Natural Resources Defense Council. She lives in \nMacon, Georgia, near the Scherer coal-fired power plant in Monroe County, Georgia. The \nScherer Plant is listed in Annex 1 as exempted from the 2024 Rule. It has technology sufficient \nto implement the modernized arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals standard of the 2024 Rule. \nWith the exemption, the Scherer Plant will no longer be required to implement or use the \ntechnology and will be allowed to emit levels of pollution in excess of the standard beginning in \nJuly 2027.

As set forth above, Plaintiffs’ members directly benefit from the public-health and \nenvironmental protections and informational benefits provided by the requirements adopted in \nthe 2024 Rule and as a result are harmed by exempting power plants from compliance with those \n48\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 49 of 58\nrequirements.6 Granting the requested relief would redress these injuries. The interests Plaintiffs \nseek to protect by bringing this case are germane to their organizational purposes of working to \nsecure reductions of harmful air pollutants from sources covered by the 2024 Rule. The \nparticipation of individual members is not required because the claims and entitlement to relief \nwill be resolved without consideration of those members’ individual circumstances. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNTONE:\n     Unlawful Executive Action in Violation of the Clean Air Act\n(Nonstatutory Review for Violations of Federal Law by Federal Officials;\nAgainst All Defendants) \n \n161.   Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in all \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint.\n162.  The Court possesses inherent equitable power to “grant injunctive relief . . . with \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., \nInc., 575 U.S. 320, 326–27 (2015). Such authority is presumptively available “absent only ‘the \nclearest command’ otherwise in a statute, . . . either express or implied.” Mathis v. United States \nParole Commission, 749 F. Supp. 3d 8, 23 (D.D.C. 2024) (quoting McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 \nU.S. 383, 397 (2013)). Congress has nowhere foreclosed review of the interpretation and \napplication of 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4).\n163.  Section 7412(i)(4) establishes a judicially manageable standard with clear and \nprecise limits of the sort federal courts routinely construe to determine whether the officials \nhave acted consistent with law. \n \n6 Plaintiffs are prepared to file their members’ declarations with their principal brief or in the \nevent their standing is challenged.\n49\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 50 of 58\n164. The Exemption Proclamation is an unlawful action that clearly exceeds the scope \nof the President’s statutory authority and rests upon an unlimited, and plainly untenable, \ninterpretation of the Clean Air Act and application of both. The Exemption Proclamation \nexceeded the authority afforded to the President by Congress in 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4)in \nmultiple respects.  \n165.  Section 7412(i)(4) authorizes an exemption only for a “stationary source,” and \nonly if the President “determines that the technology to implement such standard is not \navailable” for that source and determines “that it is in the national security interests of the \nUnited States” to exempt that source. \n166.  The President failed to make a factual determination as to “any stationary source” \nthat a technology is not available for that “stationary source” to implement the 2024 Rule, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4) and in excess of lawful authority.  \n167.  The President failed to make a factual determination as to “any stationary source” \nthat an exemption for that source is in the “national security interests of the United States,” in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4)and in excess oflawful authority.\n168. The President failed to make factual determinations as to “any stationary source” \nthat the technologyis not available and that an exemption is in the national security interests of \nthe United States, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4) and in excess of lawful authority.  \n169.  EPA and the President are bound by the Clean Air Act’s duties with respect to \nimplementing 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4), following rulemaking procedures, and being bound by \nlawfully adopted regulations. \n170.  The Exemption Proclamation exceeds the President’s statutory authority and is \ncontrary to Section 7412 of the Clean Air Act because, by granting sweeping exemptions to one \n50\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 51 of 58\nthird of regulated sources without determinations pertaining to those sources, the Proclamation \neffectively amends the compliance dates of EPA’s 2024 Rule without observing the statutorily \nmandated process for amending a rule. Section 7412(i)(4)is a narrow provision applicable in \nexceptional circumstances; it is not intended to be used as a substitute for notice-and-comment \nrulemaking to amend EPA standards that were themselves adopted after a full rulemaking \nprocess and that reflected EPA determinations that technology is available and standards \nachievable. The failure to make the required findings here operated as a process-free, evidence-\nfree amendment to the 2024 Rule. \n171. The Exemption Proclamation unlawfully attempts to amend a rule and/or stay a \nrule pending reconsideration in violation of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b), (d). \n172. The Exemption Proclamation is unlawful because it flouts the statutory purpose of \nSection 7412(i)(4) authority—to address circumstances where requiring compliance with a \nstandard would prevent the operation of national security-related equipment due to the \nunavailability of necessary control technology and instead has an improper purpose to relieve \nsources of regulatory burdens and compliance costs while EPA reconsiders the 2024 Rule. \n173.  The Proclamation exceeds the authority granted in Section 7412(i)(4) because it \nseeks to exempt sources from all the 2024 Standards indiscriminately, without identifying for \neach source which of the four distinct standards would call for technology that is \nunavailable. For example, units producing over 98% of coal plant-generated electricity in 2022 \nalready employed the 2024 Rule’s startup standard, and 93% of power plants covered by the \n2024 Rule are already meeting the arsenic, nickel, and other toxic metals standard. Section \n7412(i)(4) authorizes the President to exempt a source from a requirement if technology is \nunavailable to implement that requirement. The statute does not authorize the President or EPA \n51\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 52 of 58\nto exempt sources from requirements as to which the relevant technology is available. \nAccordingly, there could be no basis for exempting sources from all four of the 2024 Rule’s \nrequirements, even if (contrary to fact) the conditions for exemption could be satisfied for a \nsubset of the requirements. The effect of that unlawfully indiscriminate approach is to exempt \nmany sources from compliance with standards that will be implemented by technologies already \ninstalled at such sources, and to exempt other sources from compliance even where the requisite \ntechnologies required by the 2024 Rule’s compliance date are readily available and in \nwidespread use at similar sources.\n174.  The President lacks any independent authority under the U.S. Constitution to \nissue the exemptions. \n175.  Because the Exemption Proclamation is beyond the Clean Air Act authority and \nultra vires, EPA actions implementing or giving effect to the proclamation are similarly beyond \nthe Clean Air Act authority and ultra vires.\nCOUNTTWO:\n   Unlawful Executive Action in Violation of the Clean Air Act\n      (Nonstatutory Review for Violations of Federal Law by Federal Officials;\n          Against All Defendants) \n \n176.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in all \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n177.  The President granted exemptions when the technology needed to implement the \n2024 Rule is in fact available, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4) and in excess of lawful \nauthority. The relevant technologies were in widespread use by regulated sources, including at \nthe time of the Exemption Proclamation by many of the sources listed in Annex 1. \n52\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 53 of 58\n178.  The purported determinations are not supported by any factual analysis or \nreasoning and are unambiguously contradicted by factual evidence, including EPA’s own \nfindings and record for the 2024 Rule.\n179. The absence in the Exemption Proclamation, in Annex 1, or otherwise of any \nfindings, reasoning, or other facts to establish the necessary factual predicate that the needed \ntechnology is not available demonstrates that the President did not make the determinations \nrequired by 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4). That is confirmed by the fact that many of the exempted \nsources had already installed the technologies in question. Rather, the Exemption Proclamation \nbypassed and contravened statutory requirements to achieve sweeping compliance exemptions \nunauthorized by any law. \n180.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in all \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n182.  Section 7412(i)(4) authorizes the President to exempt a stationary source only \n“for a period of not more than 2 years” that begins immediately following the statutorily-\nrequired determinations. With an end date of July 8, 2029—more than four years away—the \nExemption Proclamation purports to grant exemptions exceeding the “period of not more than 2 \nyears” that Congress prescribed to allow technology to become available or national security \n53\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 54 of 58\nissues to be resolved following the President’s determinations, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7412(i)(4) and in excess of lawful authority. \n183.  The Exemption Proclamation is unlawful because the President has not made and \ncannot make a determination that the technology to implement the 2024 Rule will not be \navailable during the future period during which the exemption applies.\n184.  The Exemption Proclamation is unlawful because the President has not made and \ncannot make a determination that it is in the national security interests of the United States to \nexempt sources from compliance with the 2024 Rule during the future period during which the \nexemption applies.\n185.  Because the Exemption Proclamation is beyond the Clean Air Act authority and \nultra vires, EPA actions implementing or giving effect to the proclamation are similarly beyond \nthe Clean Air Act authority and ultra vires.\nCOUNT FOUR: \nUnauthorized Executive Action in Disregard of Section 7412(i)(4)’s  \nInapplicability to Provisions Independently Justified  \nunder Statutory Authority Other than Section 7412 \n(Nonstatutory Review for Violations of Federal Law by Federal Officials;  \n            Against All Defendants) \n \n186.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in all \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n187.  The Exemption Proclamation is ultra vires as to the continuous emissions \nmonitoring requirement because that requirement of the 2024 Rule rests on statutory authority \nindependent of 42 U.S.C. § 7412—and hence beyond the scope of the exemption provision, \nwhich is limited to standards promulgated under “this section.” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(i)(4).  The \ncontinuous emissions monitoring requirement was independently grounded on Section \n54\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01852     Document 1     Filed 06/12/25     Page 55 of 58\n7414(a)(1)(C) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7414(a)(1)(C) (authorizing EPA to require \n“any person who owns or operates any emission source … or who is subject to any \nrequirement of this chapter” to install, use, or maintain monitoring equipment). See 89 Fed. \nReg. at 38,562 (monitoring requirements “are specifically authorized by” 42 U.S.C. § 7414); \n89 Fed. Reg. at 38535 (promulgating continuous emissions monitoring requirement based on \n“additional authority” under 42 U.S.C. § 7414). Because the continuous emissions monitoring \nrequirement rests on legal grounds separate from Section 7412, the President cannot delay its \nimplementation under Section 7412(i)(4). Insofar as it purports to exempt sources from the \ncontinuous emissions monitoring requirement, the Exemption Proclamation is ultra vires. 89 \nFed. Reg. at 38,535 (promulgating continuous emissions monitoring requirement basedon \n“additional authority” under Section 7414(a)(1)(C)).\n188.
