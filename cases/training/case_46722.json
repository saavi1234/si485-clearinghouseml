    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the decision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to terminate plaintiffs&rsquo; environmental grants without notice or substantive reason. These grants, awarded in 2024 under the Biden Administration, comprised $8 million given directly to each plaintiff and access to a further $52 million for plaintiffs to distribute among other community-based environmental initiatives in their respective cities. In February 2025&mdash;under the Trump Administration&mdash;plaintiffs each received notices that their grants had been terminated. These notices of termination were strictly boilerplate and did not include any specific allegations of wrongdoing on the part of plaintiffs; plaintiffs thus alleged the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and due process. Included in this boilerplate was an EPA &ldquo;priority&rdquo; that it withhold funds from groups that participate in DEI initiatives; plaintiffs alleged that this violated the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s requirement that grant funds be used to aid underserved communities. Plaintiffs also alleged that it was a violation of the First Amendment for the Trump Administration to terminate their grants based on a difference of views regarding DEI initiatives.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs, three nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on April 2, 2025. Plaintiffs are based in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Seattle. The lawsuit named the EPA and its Administrator, Lee Zeldin, as defendants. Plaintiffs sought postponement and setting aside of the grant terminations under the APA; a declaration that the Clean Air Act prevented the EPA from choosing to withhold funds from DEI-friendly organizations; a declaration that the grant terminations were unconstitutional; a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the EPA to reinstate plaintiffs&rsquo; terminated grants and preventing it from terminating or suspending any funding to plaintiffs; and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to Judge Adam B. Abelson.</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, 2025, the court granted plaintiffs summary judgment with respect to their APA claims, setting aside the EPA&rsquo;s termination of their grants. 788 F.Supp.3d 676. The court found that even though the EPA possessed some discretion to advance its policy agenda, it was not allowed to disregard statutory requirements surrounding the grant program. Moreover, even if the agency could so contradict the expressed will of Congress, the court held that the EPA's failure to supply adequate justification for its course of action required it to set aside the grant terminations. The court declined to reach plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional claims. This constituted the final judgment of the district court.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants appealed the district court's summary judgment to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on July 16, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>On appeal, the parties did not submit opening briefs before the federal government shutdown.</p>\r\n<p>On October 1, 2025, the defendant moved to stay the appeal due to the lapse in federal appropriations that began as a result of a government shutdown. During this shutdown, government agencies must suspend operations funded by the federal appropriations at issue, and the defense of civil matters does not provide an exception, even though the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office is an excepted employee. Thus, the defendant's counsel is not permitted to continue work on this case during the lapse in appropriations. The Court granted the motion and suspended briefing pending further order.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case is about the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) canceling major environmental grants, worth up to $8 million for each plaintiff group, along with much more money for local projects. These grants were first given in 2024 under the Biden Administration, but in February 2025, after President Trump took office, the EPA told the plaintiffs their grants were terminated. The termination notices did not give any specific reasons, just general language saying the grants were being cut, and pointed to a new policy against funding groups involved in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs are three nonprofit organizations based in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Seattle. They said the EPA broke the law by ending their grants with no proper notice, explanation, or chance to fight back. They argued this violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), due process rights, and the Clean Water Act, which says grants should help underserved communities. The groups also said it was wrong for the government to cut funding just because they support DEI programs, which could violate free speech rights.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 2025, a federal judge agreed with the plaintiffs, ruling that the EPA had failed to follow required procedures. The judge canceled the grant terminations. The EPA appealed the decision, but the case was paused in October 2025 because of a government shutdown.",

(“GHHI”), the Minneapolis \nFoundation, and Philanthropy Northwest (collectively, “Plaintiffs” or the “Plaintiff \nOrganizations”) are non-profit organizations located in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Seattle, \nrespectively. In December 2023, Defendant, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), \nnamed each of the organizations a Regional Grantmaker under the Agency’s Thriving \nCommunities Grantmaking Program, and, in 2024, EPA awarded to each of the Plaintiff \nOrganizations an $8 million “initial grant” intended to facilitate further grantmaking under the \nThriving Communities program, as well as to oversee and provide support to Thriving \nCommunities subgrantees. The EPA later awarded to each organization a $52 million \n“subsequent grant,” most of which the organizations are to award to Thriving Communities \nsubgrantees to support community-based environmental protection projects. \n2.  EPA established the Thriving Communities program at the direction of Congress, \nwhich, in amendments to the Clean Air Act codified in 2022 through the enactment of the \nInflation Reduction Act, appropriated $3 billion to the EPA for “climate and environmental \njustice block grants” and mandated that the Agency “shall use” those funds to support activities \nthat monitor, prevent, and remediate pollution and mitigate climate risks in “disadvantaged \ncommunities.” 42 U.S.C. § 7438. \n3.  On February 21 and 22, 2025, EPA terminated its Thriving Communities initial \ngrant awards to the three Plaintiff Organizations, issuing to each organization a memorandum \ncontaining an identical or nearly identical statement of purported reasons for the Agency’s \ntermination decision. That statement provided several vague, unsubstantiated reasons on which \nthe termination decision was based.  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 3 of 34\n4.  Specifically, EPA stated that each organization’s grant was terminated (1) because \nEPA has declared it an “Agency priority” to withhold funds “from organizations that promote or \ntake part in diversity, equity and inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives [or] ‘environmental justice’ \ninitiatives”; (2) because the Plaintiff Organizations’ grant-funded programs may not be “free \nfrom fraud, abuse, waste, or duplication”; or (3) because the organization’s programs may \n“otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States.”  \n5.  Based on the vague, unsubstantiated statement in the termination memoranda, it is \nnot possible to understand the specific reason for the Agency’s termination of the initial grants. \nThe Agency did not, in the case of any of the three Plaintiff Organizations, make any \ndetermination, identify any evidence, or articulate any reasoning to substantiate any of the \nidentified grounds for termination.  \n6.  In terminating the initial grants, EPA violated a number of federal statutes and \nregulations, including the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Inflation Reduction Act, and the \nExecutive Branch’s own regulations governing federal grants set forth at 2 C.F.R. Part 200. In \nparticular, EPA’s actions seek to nullify the Clean Air Act’s unambiguous direction to the Agency \nto use appropriated funds to support environmental protection activities in disadvantaged \ncommunities.  \n7.  Moreover, one of the grounds that EPA has identified for terminating the three \nPlaintiff Organizations’ grants—that the Plaintiffs may “promote or take part in” certain types of \n“initiatives” that the Agency now disfavors— is plainly unconstitutional, in that it infringes on \nthe organizations’ First Amendment rights by punishing them for what the EPA perceives to be \ninappropriate viewpoints on issues of social and environmental concern (albeit without \nundertaking any examination of the Plaintiff Organizations’ actual work or views). \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 4 of 34\n8.  Around the time that EPA terminated the Plaintiff Organizations’ $8 million initial \ngrants, the Agency also suspended the organizations’ access to the $52 million in additional \nThriving Communities grant funds from which the organizations are to make subgrant awards to \ncommunity organizations.  \n9.  The frozen funds are intended to support hundreds of environmental projects in \nrural, suburban, and urban communities across the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Northwest \nregions. Already, as of the filing of this Complaint, GHHI, the Minneapolis Foundation, and \nPhilanthropy Northwest have collectively awarded more than 100 subgrants in their respective \nregions to support, among other things, the remediation of lead and toxic chemical contamination \nin parks and other community venues, the modernization of wastewater treatment processes in \nrural communities, and reductions in severe wildfire risk in fire-prone areas, among other critical \nwork.  \n10.  Immense and irreparable harm will flow to the Plaintiff Organizations from EPA’s \nactions, and that harm has already begun to accrue as of the filing of this Complaint. If Plaintiffs’ \ngrants are not reinstated and their access to funding not immediately restored, among other \nthings, they will have to lay off dozens of staff members. The relationships Plaintiffs have built \nwith partner organizations and community leaders will be severely damaged as a result of \nPlaintiffs’ inability to administer the Thriving Communities program as promised. Meanwhile, \nthe programs themselves would be largely or entirely shuttered, and environmental protection \nwork and investments undertaken in anticipation of Thriving Communities grants by Plaintiffs \nand by hundreds of non-profit organizations and local and tribal government agencies would be \nwasted and come to an end.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 5 of 34\n11.   In defiance of congressional direction, and for reasons that are unconstitutional, \nEPA has placed under threat hundreds of vital programs; has upended months of programmatic \nand fiscal planning and financial investment by the three Plaintiff Organizations and their non-\nprofit and governmental subgrantees undertaken in reliance on the Agency’s grant award; has \ninterfered with the organizations’ ongoing operations; and has disrupted the lives of dedicated \nenvironmental scientists and engineers, health professionals, educators, and other workers whose \nplans for the next one to two years focused on projects funded by the Thriving Communities \nprogram. Mass cancellation of programs and termination of employment is imminent, and \nPlaintiffs’ organizational missions will be threatened.  \n12.  As discussed below, the Court should exercise its authority under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) to set aside EPA’s arbitrary, illegal, and unconstitutional \nactions. To remedy the EPA’s unlawful actions and infringement of the Plaintiff Organizations’ \nconstitutional rights, the Court should further grant preliminary and permanent injunctive relief \ndirecting EPA to immediately reinstate the terminated initial grants and prohibiting the Agency \nfrom terminating or suspending any of the Plaintiff Organizations’ Thriving Communities grants \nor freezing any grant funding. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13.  Plaintiffs bring this action under the United States Constitution, the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq., and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201 et seq. \n14.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (action asserted against United States). \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 6 of 34\n15.  Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1), because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims asserted in this action \noccurred in the district, and because Plaintiff GHHI resides in the district. \nPARTIES \n16.  Plaintiff Green & Healthy Homes Initiative, Inc., formerly the Coalition to End \nChildhood Lead Poisoning, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Baltimore, Maryland. \nGHHI seeks to protect public health and advance housing stability in economically challenged \ncommunities.  GHHI is one of the largest healthy housing organizations in the United States. Our \nwork has long focused on addressing the housing-based causes of lead poisoning, asthma, \nhousehold injury, and energy inefficiency by creating affordable homes that are healthy, safe, and \nresilient. We provide services directly to families and communities.  We also provide advisory \nservices to other organizations focused on the creation of effective and efficient systems to \nimprove public health and economic outcomes. \n17.  Plaintiff Minneapolis Foundation is a Minnesota nonprofit corporation that is tax-\nexempt as a public charity described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is \norganized and operated exclusively for charitable and other tax-exempt purposes. The \nMinneapolis Foundation was established in 1915 and has over a century of experience \nresponding to community needs and administering charitable grantmaking programs. In \nfurtherance of its charitable purposes, the Minneapolis Foundation partners with and provides \ntechnical assistance to small nonprofit organizations. The Minneapolis Foundation also facilitates \ngrantmaking by soliciting and accepting funding from private donors and government entities, \nand administers grant funding to address emerging and ongoing community needs.  \n18.  Plaintiff Philanthropy Northwest is a regional philanthropic network comprising \n150 funders across Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming with a mission \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 7 of 34\nto “grow philanthropy’s capacity to do transformative work toward redistributing resources and \npower to underinvested communities in the Northwest and beyond.” Philanthropy Northwest is a \nnon-partisan organization, and its network includes private, public, and community foundations; \ncorporate philanthropy; and nonprofit and public sector funders supporting urban, rural, and \ntribal communities. Founded in 1976, Philanthropy Northwest seeks to facilitate philanthropic \nand cross-sector collaboration to serve and strengthen the region’s communities. To effectuate its \nmission, Philanthropy Northwest manages and distributes pooled philanthropic and/or public \nresources to organizations serving underinvested communities. \n19.  Defendant U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is a federal Executive Branch \nAgency headquartered in Washington D.C.  \n20.  Defendant Lee Zeldin is sued in his official capacity as the Administrator of the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Pursuant to Congressional Direction in the Clean Air Act, EPA Establishes the \nThriving Communities Grantmaking Program and Designates the Plaintiff \nOrganizations as Regional Grantmakers. \n21.  In the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress amended Part A of the Clean Air \nAct and appropriated $3 billion to EPA for “climate and environmental justice block grants.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 7438. Congress further mandated that the Administrator of the EPA “shall use” the \nappropriated amounts “to award grants for periods of up to 3 years” to carry out certain \nenvironmental protection activities “that benefit disadvantaged communities.” Id. \n§ 7438(a)&(b)(1). The activities eligible for support include “community-led air and other \npollution monitoring, prevention, and remediation,” “investments in low- and zero-emission and \nresilient technologies and related infrastructure,” and “mitigating climate and health risks from \nurban heat islands, extreme heat, wood heater emissions, and wildfire events.” Id. § 7438(b)(2). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 8 of 34\n22.  In 2023, EPA established the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, \nwhich seeks to facilitate the flow of the climate and environmental justice funds appropriated in \nthe Inflation Reduction Act to small non-profit organizations and local and tribal governments, in \npart by designating a Regional Grantmaker in each of EPA’s ten regions. Regional Grantmakers \nare responsible for awarding grants to subgrantees to support community-based environmental \nprotection projects to be undertaken over periods of one to two years. As EPA explained when it \nlaunched the Thriving Communities Program, projects eligible for support include community \ncleanup projects and environmental job training, as well as projects that monitor or address, for \nexample, linkages between air quality and asthma, effluent discharges from industrial facilities, \ncommunity food access, stormwater issues and green infrastructure, lead and asbestos \ncontamination, pesticides and other toxic substances, illegal dumping activities, or emergency \npreparedness and disaster resiliency.  \n23.  In response to a request for applications, GHHI, the Minneapolis Foundation, and \nPhilanthropy Northwest applied to serve as Regional Grantmakers in their respective regions. In \nDecember 2023, EPA designated the three organizations as Regional Grantmakers—GHHI for \nEPA Region 3, which encompasses Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, \nand Washington, D.C., as well as seven federally recognized tribes; Minneapolis Foundation for \nEPA Region 5, which encompasses Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, \nas well as 37 federally recognized tribes; and Philanthropy Northwest for EPA Region 10, which \nencompasses Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, along with 271 federally recognized tribes \nand tribal villages. \n24.  In May and June of 2024, EPA awarded each organization an $8 million Thriving \nCommunities “initial grant.” EPA designated these initial funds to support the hiring of Thriving \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 9 of 34\nCommunities staff, outreach to community-based organizations concerning the Thriving \nCommunities program, the development and administration of a subgrant application process in \neach region, as well as to provide technical assistance and initial oversight to subgrantees. These \ngrants were to cover work performed by the Plaintiff Organizations for a three-year period.  \n25.  Later, EPA awarded each Plaintiff Organization a Thriving Communities \n“subsequent grant” in the amount of $52 million. In their role as Regional Grantmakers, the \norganizations, after administering regional subgrantee application processes, are to use the bulk \nof the $52 million subsequent grant to award subgrants to support projects undertaken by non-\nprofit organizations and local and tribal governments selected through those application \nprocesses. \n26.  Each of the Thriving Communities grants awarded to the three Plaintiff \nOrganizations is governed by a Cooperative Agreement, and each Cooperative Agreement \nreferences General Terms and Conditions and specific regulatory requirements that govern the \ngrants. With respect to the Plaintiff Organizations’ $8 million initial grant awards, the applicable \nGeneral Terms and Conditions allow for unilateral termination of the grants by EPA, but only \nunder two sets of circumstances: first, “[i]f a recipient fails to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the award including statutory or regulatory requirements”; and second—the \nprovision that EPA has invoked here—“[i]f the award no longer effectuates the program goals or \nAgency priorities.”  \n27.  Importantly, EPA’s General Terms and Conditions identify three circumstances \nwhen the Agency may terminate an award because it “no longer effectuates the program goals or \nAgency priorities.” These are circumstances when: \ni.  EPA obtains evidence that was not considered in making the award that \nreveals that specific award objective(s) are ineffective at achieving program \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 10 of 34\ngoals and EPA determines that it is in the government’s interest to terminate \nthe award; \nii.  EPA obtains evidence that was not considered in making the award that \ncauses  EPA  to  significantly  question  the  feasibility  of  the  intended \nobjective(s) of the award and EPA determines that it is in the government’s \ninterest to terminate the award; \niii.  EPA determines that the objectives of the award are no longer consistent \nwith funding priorities for achieving program goals. \n(Emphasis added.) \n28.  Thus, under the General Terms and Conditions applicable to the Plaintiff \nOrganizations’ initial grant awards, in each circumstance when EPA invokes “program goals or \nAgency priorities” as the basis for unilateral termination of a grant award, it must “obtain \nevidence that was not considered in making the award” and/or make a “determin[ation]” \nsupporting its action. Moreover, the General Terms and Conditions nowhere permit EPA simply \nto declare its adoption of new “program goals” or “Agency priorities,” least of all goals and \npriorities that are both unconstitutionally vague and in violation of law, and then unilaterally \nterminate a grant on that basis. Any discretion reserved by EPA, in its Cooperative Agreements \nwith the Plaintiff Organizations, was limited only to determining that an award no longer \neffectuates the “program goals” or “Agency priorities” under which EPA awarded the grant in the \nfirst place.  \n29.  As further discussed below, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) \nhas promulgated regulations governing federal grant awards, including grant termination by \nExecutive Branch agencies, and EPA acknowledges that it is bound by these regulations. Under \nthe OMB federal award regulations, a federal agency terminating a grant “must provide written \nnotice of termination to the recipient,” and this notice must include “the reasons for termination.” \n2 C.F.R. § 200.341(a). Like EPA’s General Terms and Conditions, OMB’s regulations anticipate \nthat an Agency may terminate a grant, “to the extent authorized by law, if the award no longer \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 11 of 34\neffectuates the program goals or Agency priorities.” Id. § 200.340(a)(4). However, the \nregulations further provide that all grounds for termination must be “clearly and unambiguously \nspecif[ied] . . . in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.” Id. § 200.340(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded). \nB.  The Plaintiff Organizations, in Their Roles as Thriving Communities Regional \nGrantmakers, Begin to Identify and Support Community-Based Environmental \nProtection Programs in Their Respective Regions. \n30.  In reliance on their status as Regional Grantmakers and the terms of the initial \ngrants, GHHI, the Minneapolis Foundation, and Philanthropy Northwest undertook substantial \nwork to develop, and had planned additional work to implement, the Thriving Communities \nprogram in their respective regions. Plaintiffs hired new staff, built capacity, developed \npartnerships, and, in recent months, have reached out to hundreds of groups across their \nrespective regions to offer support for community-based environmental protection work.  \n31.  Because the Thriving Communities program is new (as a result of the 2022 \namendments to the Clean Air Act contained in the Inflation Reduction Act), each Plaintiff \nrecruited, hired, and trained multiple new employees to develop and administer the program.  \n32.  GHHI hired nine employees to work full-time under the Thriving Communities \nprogram for the three-year period, and it has eight additional staff members who spend at least a \nportion of their time supporting the program.  \n33.  The Minneapolis Foundation has employed 26 full-or-part-time employee \npositions allocated to its work under the Thriving Communities program.  \n34.  Philanthropy Northwest has seven staff fully funded by the initial $8 million grant \nas well as eight staff members who partially contribute their time to the administration of the \nThriving Communities program.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 12 of 34\n35.  Plaintiffs have spent considerable time developing infrastructure for the Thriving \nCommunities program in their regions. They conducted outreach, designed the application \nprocess, and began reviewing submissions from subgrantees. \n36.  For instance, Philanthropy Northwest invested a cumulative total of over 8,800 \nstaff hours working on the program in calendar year 2024.  \n37.  Throughout the development phase of the program, Plaintiffs had regular and \nextensive communications with EPA officials in their respective regions regarding their work \nunder the Thriving Communities program. Plaintiffs worked directly and iteratively with the EPA \nand received its approval on various components of their grantmaking programs, including \npublic communications, emergency information collection review forms, contracts with partner \norganizations, conflict-of-interest checks with regional advisory committee members, and quality \nassurance reviews. \n38.  Plaintiffs also had substantial work planned over the remainder of their three-year \nproject periods. This planned work includes evaluating applications and awarding subgrants, \nproviding ongoing support to subgrantees as they implement their projects, and ensuring their \nsubgrantees’ compliance with reporting and subgrant requirements.  \n39.  In developing their programs, Plaintiffs invested significant time building \nrelationships with community leaders, partner organizations, and prospective subgrantees.  \n40.  Each Plaintiff recruited individuals to join advisory boards to support the Thriving \nCommunities program. For example, The Minneapolis Foundation recruited local community \nleaders to join its Regional Advisory Committee to conduct outreach to prospective applicants \nand provide effective technical assistance support to applicants and subgrantees, as well as to \nassist with finalizing the grant application process, decision-making criteria, and reporting \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 13 of 34\nrequirements for grantees. Likewise, Philanthropy Northwest enlisted the support of \nphilanthropic leaders throughout Region 10 to advise on the overall design of the grant making \nprocess. \n41.  As part of the Thriving Communities program, Plaintiffs also built relationships \nwith technical assistance partners in their regions to lend their expertise to subgrantees.  \n42.  GHHI, for example, developed a partnership with Children’s National Hospital, \nwhich had agreed to serve as technical assistance advisor to subgrantees addressing asthma-\nrelated health hazards for children. \n43.  The Minneapolis Foundation developed a Collaborative for the Great Lakes \nThriving Communities Grantmaking Program to streamline application and reporting procedures \nto more efficiently manage the grantmaking process. Similarly, Philanthropy Northwest formed a \nTaskforce of community leaders to provide counsel on the grant application to minimize \napplicant burden. \n44.  Plaintiffs also spent substantial time educating local communities and \norganizations in their regions about the Thriving Communities program. To do so, staff members \nfrom the Plaintiff Organizations traveled throughout their respective regions, including to meet \nwith local community leaders and conduct outreach sessions detailing the Thriving Communities \nprogram.  \n45.  For instance, Philanthropy Northwest conducted 15 presentations at conferences \nor meetings to general audiences across its region; nine presentations to tribal audiences; nearly \n250 one-on-one meetings with prospective or current applicants; and sent 700 postcards across \nAlaska and Idaho for increased visibility in those states. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 14 of 34\n46.  Each Plaintiff has spent significant time soliciting and reviewing applications by \nprospective subgrantees. Plaintiffs received hundreds of applications from non-profit \norganizations and local and tribal governments seeking to monitor or address environmental \nhazards in their local communities. Plaintiffs have continued to receive applications following \nEPA’s termination of their initial grants, though their capacity to review and evaluate those \napplications has been impaired by Defendants’ actions.  \n47.  Prior to the termination of the initial grant and suspension of subsequent grant \nfunding, GHHI had started awarding subgrants under the Thriving Communities program.  \n48.  As of February 20, 2025, GHHI had awarded subgrants to 63 organizations, \nconsisting of 12 subgrantees in Maryland, 17 in Pennsylvania, 6 in the District of Columbia, 13 \nin Virginia, 13 in West Virginia, and 2 in Delaware. On or about February 21, 2025, GHHI sent \naward letters to the 63 subgrantees. These letters notified the subgrantees that they had been \nselected to receive a grant, the amount of the grant, and the next steps in the process.  \n49.  As of April 1, 2025, the Minneapolis Foundation had received more than 515 \napplications from prospective subgrantees and had identified over 40 subgrantees ready to \nreceive federal funding as soon as access is made available to the subsequent grant. \n50.  Similarly, Philanthropy Northwest has reviewed applications and identified 42 \nsubgrantees whose subawards are pending. \nC.  Based on Vague and Unsubstantiated of Reasons, EPA Terminates the Plaintiff \nOrganizations’ Thriving Communities Initial Grants and Suspends Access to \nSubsequent Grant Funding, While Declaring it an “Agency Priority” Not to Fund \n“Organizations that Promote ‘DEI’ Initiatives or ‘Environmental Justice’ \nInitiatives.” \n51.  On February 21 and 22, 2025, EPA terminated the $8 million Thriving \nCommunities initial grants that it had previously awarded to each of the Plaintiff Organizations. \nEPA effectuated these actions by issuing a termination memorandum to each organization. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 15 of 34\nAlthough the memoranda sent to GHHI, the Minneapolis Foundation, and Philanthropy \nNorthwest were purportedly authored by different “EPA Award Officials” assigned to different \nEPA regional offices, the text of each memorandum is identical or nearly identical to the others. \nEach memorandum was accompanied by an Assistance Amendment to the prior Cooperative \nAgreement governing the organization’s Thriving Communities initial grant award. \n52.  The termination memorandum sent to each organization cites the grant regulations \nat 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 and states that the organization’s Thriving Communities initial grant “is \nterminated in its entirety effective immediately on the grounds that the award no longer \neffectuates the program goals or Agency priorities.” Each memorandum then explains as follows: \nIt is a priority of the EPA to eliminate discrimination in all programs . . . . The EPA \nAdministrator  has  determined  that,  per  the  Agency’s  obligations  to  the \nconstitutional and statutory law of the United States, this priority includes ensuring \nthat the Agency’s grants do not support programs or organizations that promote or \ntake part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives, “environmental \njustice” initiatives, and conflict with the Agency’s policy of prioritizing merit, \nfairness, and excellence in performing our statutory functions. . . . \nThe grant specified above provides funding for programs that promote or take part \nin DEI initiatives or environmental justice initiatives or other initiatives that conflict \nwith  the  Agency’s  policy  of  prioritizing  merit,  fairness,  and  excellence  in \nperforming our statutory functions; that are not free from fraud, abuse, waste, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States. \nThe  grant  is  therefore  inconsistent  with,  and  no  longer  effectuates, Agency \npriorities. \n53.  The termination memorandum provides no further explanation for the Agency’s \naction. EPA does not give, and has not subsequently given, any content whatsoever to its newly \ndeclared “Agency priority” not to fund “environmental justice” and to withhold financial support \nfrom “organizations that promote or take part in . . . ‘DEI’ or ‘environmental justice’ initiatives.” \nEPA has not explained how it reconciles its “Agency priority” to defund “environmental justice” \nwith the congressional directive in the Clean Air Act that it “shall use” the appropriated funds at \nissue to award “environmental and climate justice block grants.” 42 U.S.C. § 7438. EPA has not \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 16 of 34\nidentified any offending “DEI” or “environmental justice” “initiatives” that it believes the \nPlaintiff Organizations have “promote[d],” or in which it believes the organizations have \n“take[n] part.” EPA has not pointed to any evidence on which a finding of “promoting or taking \npart in” disfavored “initiatives” could be based. Moreover, EPA has not identified the \n“constitutional and statutory law of the United States” that it claims forms the basis for its newly \ndeclared “Agency priority.” The Agency has not even defined the terms “DEI” or “environmental \njustice.” \n54.  Meanwhile, EPA’s references in its termination memoranda to “fraud, waste, \nabuse or duplication” and “the best interests of the United States” are wholly conclusory and \nwithout basis. The Agency says nothing at all to substantiate or explain either of these grounds \nfor terminating the Plaintiff Organizations’ initial grant awards. \n55.  Around the same time that EPA terminated the Plaintiff Organizations’ Thriving \nCommunities $8 million initial grants, the Agency also suspended the organizations’ access to \nthe $52 million in subsequent grant funds, from which the organizations are to award subgrants \nto local and tribal government agencies and non-profit organizations to support environmental \nprotection projects in communities throughout their respective regions. \nD.  EPA’s actions will cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff Organizations and will \njeopardize environmental programs in disadvantaged communities across the \ncountry. \n56.  GHHI, the Minneapolis Foundation, and Philanthropy Northwest have been, and \nwill continue to be, irreparably harmed by the termination of their grant awards and suspension \nof access to grant funding.  \n57.  Most imminently, the Plaintiff Organizations will be forced to lay off staff they \ncan no longer pay due to the termination of their initial grants. Plaintiffs have already curtailed \ntheir work under the Thriving Communities program and likely will be forced to abandon the \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 17 of 34\nprogram altogether. Given their inability to fulfill their obligations to partner organizations and \nsubgrantees, Plaintiffs will also suffer serious and irreversible reputational harm.  \n58.  For GHHI, the terminated $8 million grant covered the salaries for staff members \nworking on the Thriving Communities program. If funding is not restored, GHHI will be forced \nto lay off between 8 and 10 staff members.  \n59.  For the Minneapolis Foundation, the termination of the initial $8 million grant \ncombined with the lack of access to the subsequent grant will result in the loss of 26 full- or part-\ntime positions allocated to the Thriving Communities program across the Minneapolis \nFoundation and its Collaborative implementing partners. These staff and independent contractors \nare located across EPA Region 5 and perform a variety of roles supporting the grant program, \nincluding on its advisory and review committees, communications teams, compliance functions, \nevaluations, finance and grants administration, information technology, outreach services, \nprogram management and oversight, and technical assistance for subrecipients.  \n60.  For Philanthropy Northwest, the termination of the initial grant and lack of access \nto the subsequent grant funds will result in the loss of jobs for the seven staff fully funded by the \ninitial grant and likely for additional staff members in the organization.  \n61.  Losing so many staff members will also adversely impact Plaintiffs’ ability to \ncarry out their organizational missions and will cause irreparable reputational damage, making it \nmore difficult for them to hire staff in the future. These employees work in essential positions \nfully funded by the initial grant and have spent months gaining familiarity with the program and \nEPA requirements, while also building trust with subrecipient applicants and program partners. \nLosing numerous staff members at once due to the grant termination and suspension of funding \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 18 of 34\nwould make it more difficult for the Plaintiff Organizations to recruit and retain employees in the \nfuture. \n62.  In reliance on the promised funding, the Plaintiff Organizations had already \nengaged in and planned significant work for the remainder of their grant terms. Plaintiffs lack \nalternate sources of funding to replace the terminated and suspended grant funding. The $8 \nmillion initial grants comprise a significant portion of the Plaintiff Organizations’ annual \nbudgets, and Plaintiffs are unable to fundraise the same amounts to pay staff and continue their \ncritical work. Plaintiffs do not have alternative grant sources that can be quickly reallocated or \ndeployed to cover the gap, making it impossible to fully absorb the financial impact within the \ncurrent fiscal period.  \n63.  Plaintiffs have already limited their work under the Thriving Communities \nprogram and will have to cease all operations under the program, including their issuance and \nadministration of subgrants, as a result of EPA’s termination and suspension of grant funding. \nThe Thriving Communities program is a key initiative for all three Plaintiff Organizations. The \nsudden and arbitrary nature in which grant funding has been withheld—in the middle of the grant \ncycles—has upended more than a year of work and disrupted future work.  \n64.  For instance, the termination of essential positions fully funded by the initial grant \nat the Minneapolis Foundation would make it impossible for the Program to continue as \noriginally designed. As a result of the termination, the Minneapolis Foundation has been forced \nto halt any new contracts and travel associated with the technical assistance support it provides to \napplicants, impeding many eligible grant subrecipients in their efforts to successfully apply for or \nmanage any federal funding received under the Thriving Communities program. The loss of this \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 19 of 34\nsupport would significantly hamper the Minneapolis Foundation’s ability to review and process \napplications from prospective subrecipients.  \n65.  GHHI also directed its technical assistance partners to stop all work in connection \nwith the Thriving Communities program. The loss of this work will have far-reaching \nconsequences. For example, one of GHHI’s technical assistance partners, the Children’s National \nHospital, will be unable to assist subgrantees that are seeking to reduce asthma-related health \nhazards for children.  \n66.  Likewise, without access to the terminated funding, Philanthropy Northwest will \nbe unable to complete the rigorous award preparation phase. This phase includes kickoff \nmeetings to establish the subgrantee and grantmaker relationship, subgrantee capacity \nassessment and review of grant and compliance guidelines, financial management and subaward \norientation trainings, review and refinement of project workplans and budgets, and establishment \nof payment and reporting schedules. This process requires hours of work from both the \nsubgrantees and Philanthropy Northwest, all before the subgrant agreements are signed.  \n67.  In addition to the work they have already stopped, the Plaintiff Organizations will \nbe unable to complete the work they had planned for the remainder of the three-year grant \nperiod. Because of EPA’s termination and suspension of Thriving Communities grant funding, \nPlaintiffs will be unable to properly vet, award, administer, and monitor the additional $144 \nmillion in grantmaking ($48 million from each of the three $52 million grants) to their \nsubgrantees. In short, Plaintiffs will be unable to effectively implement the Thriving \nCommunities program.  \n68.  For example, although the subsequent $52 million grant includes resources \navailable for unhired positions, the termination of the initial grant and continued suspension of \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 20 of 34\naccess to the subsequent grant has restricted the Minneapolis Foundation from recruiting and \nhiring new staff members. Without the ability to hire additional staff members, the Minneapolis \nFoundation will not have the capacity to review, process, and manage the large number of \nsubgrants that the Thriving Communities Program is intended to support. Taken together, the \ntermination of the initial grant and the lack of access to the subsequent grant account will make it \nimpossible for the Minneapolis Foundation to expend all of the subsequent grant dollars within \nthe allotted grant period over the next two years. \n69.  Without adequate staffing or funding, the Plaintiff Organizations will not be able \nto meet their commitments to partner organizations and subgrantees, eroding trust in Plaintiffs \nand damaging their reputations. Not only will these organizations and subgrantees lose \nconfidence in Plaintiffs’ ability to administer the program, but performance by the partner \norganizations and subgrantees will suffer as a result of the grant terminations and suspension of \nfunding.  \n70.  The reputations that the Plaintiff Organizations have painstakingly built have been \nand will continue to be damaged by Defendants’ actions. If Plaintiffs are wrongly perceived to \nhave engaged in any of the conduct described in the termination memorandum, federal, state, \nlocal, philanthropic and private organizations will be hesitant to associate with or support \nPlaintiffs. \n71.  For example, the Minneapolis Foundation’s fundholder assets account for \napproximately 75% of its current assets. Any grant termination would make it more difficult to \nsecure future contributions from donors, given the specter of uncertainty raised by such a \nsubstantial loss in funding and questions that may arise from the perception that the Minneapolis \nFoundation could not successfully perform against its grants. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 21 of 34\n72.  The harms caused by Defendants’ actions will reverberate throughout the regions \nthe Plaintiff Organizations serve. Due to EPA’s termination of the grants and suspension of \naccess to grant funding, Plaintiffs’ subgrantees will lose critical funding and support for their \nplanned projects, which will create budget and staffing chaos in those organizations. Many \nsubgrantees have paused hiring program staff or implementation of their planned projects \nbecause they lack confidence in Plaintiffs’ ability to deliver promised funding.  \n73.  Dozens of subgrantees, who have planned projects including the remediation of \nlead and asbestos poisoning and the reduction of childhood asthma, will be compromised in their \nefforts to remedy hazards that negatively impact the health and safety of their communities. \nExamples from each of Plaintiffs’ subgrantees underscore the immediate and irreparable harm \ncaused by the grant terminations.  \n74.  GHHI awarded $280,000 to a nonprofit community development organization in \nWest Virginia. In recent years, storm events in Fort Gay, West Virginia, have caused sewage to \noverflow into the public drinking water system and local bodies of water. The non-profit had \nplanned to use the subgrant awarded by GHHI to prevent future overflows and contamination of \nlocal water sources.  \n75.  GHHI had planned to award approximately $350,000 to a city development \nauthority for a project to remediate lead contamination in a local park on the bank of the Ohio \nriver. Recent testing has confirmed dangerously high levels of lead contamination in the soil of \nthe park campgrounds.  Such contamination has been documented to harm the brain and \ncognitive ability, damage bones and kidneys, and increase cancer risk.  \n76.  The Minneapolis Foundation had planned to award approximately $350,000 to \nsupport wastewater treatment processes in two small rural Appalachian communities in Ohio, \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 22 of 34\neach with populations of less than 500. Specifically, the grants are designed to support the use of \nfixed-film wastewater treatment processes that eliminate the use of blowers common in many \ntreatment processes, aiding the communities in leveraging the same land footprint for wastewater \ntreatment as will be used for energy production itself. The modest energy demand for the pumps \ncan be efficiently served by grid-tied solar panels, meaning the project also involves an \nenvironmental job training component by way of a solar installer course.  \n77.  The Minneapolis Foundation had also planned to award approximately $350,000 \nto a rural, federally recognized tribe to clean up an unregulated dump site in Michigan posing \npublic health concerns due to downgradient drinking-water wells and exposure to contaminated \nmaterials. Site assessments show a perched, contaminated aquifer within the dump that could be \nbreached as the dump site erodes further. The subgrant funding is intended to provide access to \nheavy equipment to begin the removal of exposed hazardous materials constituting an immediate \npublic health threat, allowing the tribe to clean up the dump site and ultimately gain approval for \nfuture housing developments in the area.  \n78.  Philanthropy Northwest already selected 42 applications for funding at a \ncumulative $14.5 million. These selectees include 12 from Alaska, two from Idaho, 12 from \nOregon, and 16 from Washington, including eight federally recognized tribes or Alaska Native \nvillages. These entities are spread across remote, rural, and urban areas of each state—from the \nSeward Peninsula in Alaska to Southwest Idaho to the Oregon Coast to Eastern Washington, and \nmajor cities in between. Forty percent of the projects serve rural or remote areas, and projects are \nwell distributed within the four states. These projects were designed to support efforts such as: \naddressing food security challenges in a remote community by promoting revitalization of \nIndigenous food systems of harvesting and preservation (Alaska); reducing the risk of severe \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 23 of 34\nwildfires through programs that promote community involvement and preparedness (Idaho); \nimplementing clean energy retrofits to lower household energy costs and protect indoor air \nquality for low-income households (Oregon); and supporting a tribe’s regional emergency \nmanagement in a remote, highly visited area vulnerable to flooding, severe weather, and \nearthquakes (Washington).  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I – Administrative Procedure Act \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action –  \nFailure to Supply Reasons and Engage in Reasoned Decisionmaking  \n79.  Each foregoing paragraph is incorporated as if restated fully herein. \n80.  Under the APA, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by final agency action \nis entitled to judicial review of that action. 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. The APA provides that a \nreviewing court shall “hold unlawful and set aside Agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary \nand capricious.” Id. § 706(2)(A). \n81.  EPA’s termination of its Thriving Communities initial grant awards to the Plaintiff \nOrganizations is final “Agency action” for purposes of the APA. See id. § 551(6), (13). EPA’s \nsuspension of the organizations’ access to Thriving Communities grant funds is also final agency \naction. See, e.g., Chamblee v. Espy, 100 F. 3d 15 (4th Cir. 1996). \n82.  Through its requirement that “arbitrary and capricious” agency action be set aside \non judicial review, the APA establishes a fundamental requirement that agencies engage in \n“reasoned decisionmaking.” See, e.g., Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 \nU.S. 1, 16 (2020); see also 5 U.S.C. § 555(e) (requiring that agencies provide “statement of the \ngrounds” even for informal agency action).  \n83.  In terminating the Plaintiff Organizations’ Thriving Communities initial grants \nand suspending the organizations’ access to all Thriving Communities’ grant funds, EPA did not \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 24 of 34\nsupply a valid statement of reasons for taking these actions. Nor did it engage in reasoned \ndecisionmaking. \n84.  EPA identified three vague and baseless grounds for its actions: (1) because the \ngrant awards are purportedly inconsistent with EPA’s newly-adopted “Agency priority” to \nwithdraw financial support from “organizations that promote or take part in … ‘DEI’ [or] \n‘environmental justice’ initiatives”; (2) because the organizations’ grant-funded programs are \npurportedly not be “free from fraud, abuse, waste, or duplication”; or (3) because the \norganizations’ programs allegedly “otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States.” \nEPA’s stated reasons for termination of the grants are so varied and ambiguous that the statement \nis meaningless. The Agency gave no legitimate reason for its actions. \n85.   EPA provided no rationale for its actions beyond this vague and unsubstantiated  \nstatement. The Agency did not identify any evidence, find any facts, or supply any reasoning that \nwould support any of its three stated reasons for terminating the grants. With respect to EPA’s \nnewly adopted “Agency priority” to withhold financial support from “organizations that promote \nor take part in … ‘DEI’ [or] ‘environmental justice’ initiatives,” EPA has not identified any \noffending “initiatives” that it believes the Plaintiff Organizations have “promote[d],” or in which \nit believes the organizations have “take[n] part.” EPA has not pointed to any evidence on which a \nfinding of “promoting or taking part in” disfavored “initiatives” could be based. EPA has not \nidentified the “constitutional and statutory law of the United States” that it claims forms the basis \nfor its newly declared “Agency priority.” The Agency has not even defined the terms “DEI” or \n“environmental justice.” \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 25 of 34\n86.  Meanwhile, EPA’s invocations of “fraud, waste, abuse or duplication” and “the \nbest interests of the United States” are pure boilerplate. The Agency does not supply even a hint \nof anything that it might be referencing.  \n87.  Simply put, EPA’s actions here, in addition to being unlawful and \nunconstitutional, are a paradigm of arbitrary and capricious Agency action constituting an \nimproper abuse of discretion as those terms are used in the APA. \n88.  As a result of EPA’s arbitrary and capricious actions and the abuse of its \ndiscretion, Plaintiff Organizations have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n89.  The Plaintiff Organizations are entitled to preliminary and permanent relief under \nthe APA, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706, including an order holding unlawful and setting aside EPA’s \ntermination of the organizations’ Thriving Communities initial grant awards and suspension of \nthe organizations’ access to Thriving Communities grant funds. \nCount II – Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action in Excess of Statutory Authority – Clean Air Act \n \n90.  Each foregoing paragraph is incorporated as if restated fully herein. \n91.  Under the APA, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by final agency action \nis entitled to judicial review of that action. 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. The APA provides that a \nreviewing court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . in excess of \nstatutory . . . authority.” Id. § 706(2)(C). \n92.  EPA’s termination of the Thriving Communities initial grants awarded to the \nPlaintiff Organizations is final “agency action” for purposes of the APA. See id. § 551(6), (13). \nEPA’s suspension of the organizations’ access to Thriving Communities grant funds is also final \nagency action. See, e.g., Chamblee v. Espy, 100 F. 3d 15 (4th Cir. 1996). \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 26 of 34\n93.  In the Inflation Reduction Act amendments to the Clean Air Act, Congress \nappropriated $3 billion to EPA for “climate and environmental justice block grants.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7438. The Clean Air Act further directs that the Agency’s Administrator “shall use” those \namounts “to award grants . . . to carry out activities . . . that benefit disadvantaged communities” \nby, among other things, monitoring, preventing and remediating pollution and mitigating climate \nrisk. Id. § 7438(a) & (b)(1).  \n94.  In terminating the Thriving Communities initial grants that it had previously \nawarded to the Plaintiff Organizations, EPA stated in each case that its “Agency priorities” no \nlonger include “funding . . . ‘environmental justice’ initiatives.”  \n95.  EPA and Administrator Zeldin had no statutory authority to terminate the grants or \nsuspend access to grant funding on this basis. In the Clean Air Act, Congress did not confer any \ndiscretion on the Agency to determine that its own “priorities” no longer match those of \nCongress and on that basis to decline to fund environmental protection activities that benefit \ndisadvantaged communities. To the contrary, the Clean Air Act unambiguously provides that the \nEPA and Administrator Zeldin “shall use” appropriated amounts to fund “environmental justice” \ninitiatives. The Agency and its Administrator, in declaring it an “Agency priority” not to fund \nsuch initiatives, have acted in defiance of that congressional direction. \n96.  As a result of the unlawful actions of the EPA and Administrator Zeldin, the \nPlaintiff Organizations have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n97.  The Plaintiff Organizations are entitled to preliminary and permanent relief under \nthe APA, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706, including an order holding unlawful and setting aside EPA’s \ntermination of the organizations’ Thriving Communities initial grant awards and suspension of \nthe organizations’ access to grant funds. Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the organizations \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 27 of 34\nare entitled to a declaration that the Clean Air Act’s direction to the EPA to fund “environmental \njustice” grants precludes the EPA from terminating grants or suspending grant funding because \nthe Agency has adopted a “priority” not to fund such grants. The Plaintiff Organizations are \nfurther entitled to an injunction directing EPA and Administrator Zeldin to reinstate the grant \nawards and prohibiting Defendants from terminating or suspending any of the Plaintiffs’ \nThriving Communities grants or freezing funding under any of the grants. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, \n2202. \nCount III – United States Constitution \nViolation of First and Fifth Amendments \n98.  Each foregoing paragraph is incorporated as if restated fully herein. \n99.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government \nfrom “abridging the freedom of speech . . . or the right of the people . . . to petition the \nGovernment for a redress of grievance.” It is a “core postulate” of the First Amendment that \n“[t]he government may not discriminate against speech based on the ideas or opinions it \nconveys.” Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, 393 (2019). Indeed, “[v]iewpoint discrimination is \npoison to a free society.” Id. at 399 (Alito, J., concurring).  \n100.  In terminating the Thriving Communities initial grants that it had previously \nawarded to the Plaintiff Organizations, EPA declared it an “Agency priority” to ensure “that the \nAgency’s grants do not support . . . organizations that promote or take part in diversity, equity, \nand inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives [or] ‘environmental justice’ initiatives.” In so stating, EPA has \nacknowledged engaging in viewpoint discrimination. \n101.  The First Amendment prohibits EPA and Administrator Zeldin from terminating \ngrants or suspending grant funding based on their perception that the Plaintiff Organizations \n“promote” or “take part in” viewpoints with regard to “environmental justice” that the \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 28 of 34\ngovernment now disfavors. Moreover, the First Amendment protects the Plaintiff Organizations’ \nadvocacy for and on behalf of disadvantaged communities. \n102.  The Fifth Amendment prohibits “depriv[ations] of life, liberty, or property without \ndue process of law.” \n103.  In terminating the Plaintiff Organizations’ initial grant award and suspending their \naccess to subsequent grant funds without any legitimate reason, EPA and Administrator Zeldin \nhave violated Plaintiffs’ due process rights. \n104.  As a result of the unconstitutional actions of the EPA and Administrator Zeldin, \nthe Plaintiff Organizations have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n105.  Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Plaintiff Organizations are entitled to a \ndeclaration that EPA’s actions infringe the organizations’ constitutional rights and are therefore \nunlawful. The Plaintiff Organizations are further entitled to an injunction directing EPA and \nAdministrator Zeldin to reinstate the grant awards and prohibiting Defendants from terminating \nor suspending any of the organizations’ Thriving Communities grants or freezing funding under \nany of the grants. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202. \nCount IV – Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Contrary to Constitutional Right \n106.  Each foregoing paragraph is incorporated as if restated fully herein. \n107.  Under the APA, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by final agency action \nis entitled to judicial review of that action. 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. The APA provides that a \nreviewing court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . contrary to \nconstitutional right.” Id. § 706(2)(B). \n108.  EPA’s termination of the Thriving Communities initial grants awarded to the \nPlaintiff Organizations is final “agency action” for purposes of the APA. See id. § 551(6), (13). \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 29 of 34\nEPA’s suspension of the organizations’ access to Thriving Communities grant funds is also final \nagency action. See, e.g., Chamblee v. Espy, 100 F. 3d 15 (4th Cir. 1996). \n109.  In terminating the Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities initial grants, EPA stated that \nit was doing so to ensure “that the Agency’s grants do not support . . . organizations that promote \nor take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives [or] ‘environmental justice’ \ninitiatives.” In so stating, EPA has acknowledged engaging in viewpoint discrimination. \n110.  The agencies’ actions are unconstitutional. The First Amendment prohibits EPA \nand Administrator Zeldin from terminating grants or suspending access to grant funds based on \ntheir perception that the Plaintiff Organizations “promote” or “take part in” viewpoints with \nregard to “environmental justice” that the government disfavors. Moreover, the First Amendment \nprotects the Plaintiff Organizations’ advocacy for and on behalf of disadvantaged communities. \n111.  As a result of the unconstitutional actions of the EPA and Administrator Zeldin, \nthe Plaintiff Organizations have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n112.  The Plaintiff Organizations are entitled to preliminary and permanent relief under \nthe APA, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706, including an order holding unlawful and setting aside EPA’s \ntermination of the organizations’ Thriving Communities initial grants and suspension of their \naccess to Thriving Communities grant funds. \nCount V – Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Not in Accordance with Law or Regulation and Without Observance of \nProcedure Required by Law — Violations of Federal Award Regulations, Accardi Doctrine \n113.  Each foregoing paragraph is incorporated as if restated fully herein. \n114.  Under the APA, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by final agency action \nis entitled to judicial review of that action. 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. The APA provides that a \nreviewing court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . not in \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 30 of 34\naccordance with law” or “without observance of procedure required by law.” Id. \n§ 706(2)(A)&(D). \n115.  EPA’s termination of Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities initial grants is final \n“agency action” for purposes of the APA. See id. § 551(6), (13). \n116.  When the government adopts regulations with the force and effect of law, it must \nabide by those regulations. See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 \n(1954). With respect to federal grants, OMB has adopted regulations limiting the circumstances \nunder which a federal agency may terminate a grant award. See 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340, .341. EPA \nacknowledges that it is bound by these regulations. \n117.  The federal award regulations provide that an agency terminating a grant “must \nprovide written notice of termination to the recipient,” and that such notice must “include the \nreasons for termination.” Id. § 200.341(a). In terminating the Plaintiff Organizations’ Thriving \nCommunities initial grants, EPA failed to adhere to this regulatory requirement. The Agency \nfailed to provide a meaningful statement of its “reasons for termination.” EPA’s reasons for \nterminating the Plaintiffs’ initial grants are unconstitutionally vague and unsubstantiated. \n118.  The applicable regulations permit an agency to terminate a grant award “pursuant \nto terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an \naward no longer effectuates program goals or Agency priorities.” Id. § 200.340(a)(4) (emphasis \nadded). However, the agency must “clearly and unambiguously specify all termination \nprovisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.” Id. § 200.340(b) (emphasis added). \n119.  In the case of Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities initial grants, the General Terms \nand Conditions, which incorporate 2 C.F.R. Part 200, identify three specific circumstances when \nEPA may terminate an award because it “no longer effectuates program goals or Agency \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 31 of 34\npriorities.” In each identified circumstance, the Agency must “obtain[] evidence” and/or make a \n“determin[ation]” supporting a particular conclusion concerning the award’s effectuation of \n“program goals or Agency priorities.” Nowhere do the General Terms and Conditions \ncontemplate, let alone “clearly and unambiguously specify,” that the EPA may terminate an \naward based on its identification of new “Agency priorities or program goals.”  \n120.  Here, in terminating the Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities initial grants, EPA in \neach case purported to invoke its authority under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) to terminate an award \nthat “no longer effectuates . . . Agency priorities.” However, EPA did not adhere to that \nregulation, both because it failed to abide by procedures described in the grant award’s “terms \nand conditions,” id., and because it relied on grounds for termination that were not “clearly and \nunambiguously specif[ied] . . . in the terms and conditions,” id. § 200.340(b).  \n121.  With regard to procedure, the applicable General Terms and Conditions require \nEPA to “obtain evidence” or make a “determination” prior to terminating the grants on the basis \nof “program goals” or “Agency priorities,” but here EPA has not identified any evidence or made \nany determination that supports grant termination. In particular, and even setting aside the \nunconstitutionality of EPA’s adoption of an “Agency priority” to withhold financial support from \norganizations that “promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives [or] \n‘environmental justice’ initiatives,” EPA has not obtained any evidence, nor has it made any \ndetermination, that the Plaintiff Organizations promote or take part in such initiatives. Because \nEPA failed here to adhere to “the terms and conditions of the federal award,” 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4), its actions were without observance of procedure required by law. \n122.  With regard to the specification of grounds for termination, the General Terms and \nConditions refer exclusively to EPA’s unilateral termination of an award based on evidence or a \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 32 of 34\ndetermination that the award no longer effectuates the “program goals or Agency priorities” \nunder which the grant was awarded in the first place. No reader of the General Terms and \nConditions would understand that these “environmental justice” grant awards could be \nterminated because of the Agency’s adoption of a sweeping new “priority” to deny financial \nsupport to organizations that advocate for “environmental justice” or for disadvantaged \ncommunities or for other disfavored viewpoints on social issues. Indeed, if EPA were correct that \nit could unilaterally terminate an “environmental justice” grant award merely by declaring it an \n“Agency priority” not to fund “environmental justice” grant awards, then it would have been \nmeaningless to include termination provisions in the terms and conditions for the grant: there \nwould be no limits on EPA’s rights to terminate the award. In any event, the applicable terms and \nconditions do not “clearly and unambiguously specify” the possibility of such unilateral \ntermination, 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(b), and EPA’s actions are therefore contrary to law.  \n123.  As a result of the failure of the EPA and Administrator Zeldin to follow the \nexecutive branch’s own regulations governing the termination of grant awards, Plaintiff \nOrganizations have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n124.  The Plaintiff Organizations are entitled to preliminary and permanent relief under \nthe APA, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706, including that EPA’s termination of the organizations’ \nThriving Communities initial grant awards be held unlawful and set aside. Under the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, the organizations are further entitled to a declaration that EPA failed to adhere to \nfederal award regulations in terminating the grants and that its actions are therefore unlawful, as \nwell as an injunction directing EPA and Administrator Zeldin to reinstate the grant awards and \nprohibiting the Agency from terminating or suspending any of the organizations’ Thriving \nCommunities grants or freezing funding under any of the grants. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202. \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 1     Filed 04/02/25     Page 33 of 34\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  Plaintiffs request that the Court: \nA.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 705, postpone the \neffective date of the EPA’s termination of Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities initial grant awards, \npending final judicial review; \nB.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, hold unlawful and \nset aside, after judicial review, the EPA’s termination of the Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities \ngrants and suspension of access to grant funding on the grounds that the Agency’s action was \narbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory authority, contrary to constitutional right, not in \naccordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law; \nC.  Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, declare that the \nEPA’s termination of Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities initial grant awards is unlawful, because \nthe Clean Air Act’s direction that the EPA “shall” use appropriated funds for “environmental \njustice” grants precludes the Agency from declaring it an “Agency priority” not to fund such \ngrants, because the Agency’s actions infringe Plaintiffs’ rights under the First and Fifth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution, and because the Agency’s actions are not in accordance \nwith applicable regulations governing the termination of federal grant awards; \nD.  Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2202, grant preliminary \nand permanent injunctive relief directing EPA and Administrator Zeldin to reinstate Plaintiffs’ \nThriving Communities initial grant awards and prohibiting the Agency from terminating or \nsuspending any of the organizations’ Thriving Communities grants or freezing funding under any \nof the grants;  \nE.   Award to Plaintiffs their attorneys’ fees and costs; and \nF.

Defendants, the United States Environmental \nProtection Agency and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in his official capacity, have terminated \ngrants that EPA previously awarded to the Plaintiff Organizations under the agency’s Thriving \nCommunities Grantmaking Program and have suspended Plaintiffs’ access to Thriving \nCommunities grant funding. The Plaintiff Organizations respectfully request that the Court enter \nan order requiring Defendants to reinstate Plaintiffs’ terminated grant awards and prohibiting \nDefendants from terminating, suspending, or freezing funding under any of Plaintiffs’ Thriving \nCommunities grants.  \nAs discussed in the enclosed Memorandum of Law, EPA’s actions are arbitrary and \ncapricious. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). EPA offered no meaningful explanation for terminating \nand suspending access to the grant funds at issue, instead providing only a boilerplate list of \nvague and conclusory grounds on which its actions might be based, referencing, variously, \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 2     Filed 04/02/25     Page 2 of 3\n“DEI,” “environmental justice,” “fraud, waste, abuse, and duplication,” and “the best interests of \nthe United States.” EPA’s actions are also facially unlawful. See id. § 706(2)(A)-(D). The \nagency’s boilerplate statement includes an assertion that the Plaintiff Organizations’ grants are \n“inconsistent with” a newly-declared “Agency priority” not to provide funding for “organizations \nthat promote or take part in . . . ‘environmental justice’ initiatives.” The Clean Air Act, under \nwhich EPA awarded the funds at issue, affords no discretion to EPA to adopt such a “priority,” \nbecause the Act mandates that the EPA’s Administrator “shall use” the funds for “environmental \nand climate justice” initiatives. 42 U.S.C. § 7438. EPA’s actions are also patently \nunconstitutional. The agency cannot, consistent with the First Amendment to the Constitution, \nadopt an “Agency priority” to withhold grant funding or terminate previously-awarded grants \nbased on its perception that an organization “promote[s] or take[s] part in . . . initiatives” that the \nagency disfavors. \nAs established in the enclosed Memorandum, the Plaintiff Organizations are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the United \nStates Constitution, they are suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable harm without a \npreliminary injunction, the balance of equities weighs in their favor, and preliminary relief is in \nthe public interest. \nDated: April 2, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \n   \n                       \nJessica C.

The statute is specific, and mandatory. Congress mandated that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency “shall use” the appropriated funds to fund “eligible \nentit[ies]” (such as local governments and nonprofit organizations) to conduct certain \n“[e]ligible activities” such as pollution remediation and investments in low-emission \ntechnologies. Id. § 7438(b)(2). Congress further required that such programs “benefit \ndisadvantaged communities, as defined by the [EPA].” Id. § 7438(b)(1). \nIn compliance with that statutory mandate, EPA selected ten Regional \nGrantmakers and delegated to them authority to select programs to receive sub-grants. \nThe Regional Grantmakers included the three plaintiffs that have brought this case: \nGreen and Healthy Homes Initiative, Inc. (“GHHI”), the Minneapolis Foundation, and \nPhilanthropy Northwest. They geared up and began complying with their obligations as \nRegional Grantmakers. Then, in February 2025, EPA announced that “environmental \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 2 of 48\njustice” is no longer an agency “priority.” Based solely on that change in policy priority, \nEPA terminated all § 7438 grants, and retracted the Regional Grantmakers’ authority to \nfund statutorily designated activities.  \n  Plaintiffs brought this case challenging the termination of their grants. They \ncontend EPA has violated the Administrative Procedures Act by (a) failing to “supply a \nvalid statement of reasons for taking these actions” or “engage in reasoned \ndecisionmaking,” ECF No. 1 ¶ 83, (b) exceeding its statutory authority, ECF No. 1 ¶ 95, \n(c) violating the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, id. ¶¶ 100-103, \n109-110, and (d) violating regulations limiting the circumstances in which a federal \nagency may terminate a grant award, id. ¶¶ 120-22. Defendants dispute those claims \nand further contend that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  \nChanges in administration often entail changes in policy priorities, and policy \nchanges can mean budgets are redirected. EPA has some leeway, consistent with its \nstatutory mandate, to decide how to administer the environmental and climate justice \nblock grants program Congress created and funded through § 7438 of the Clean Air Act. \nBut that statute, and the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Constitution, impose \ncertain limit and procedural requirements. For example, “the President and federal \nagencies may not ignore statutory mandates or prohibitions merely because of policy \ndisagreement with Congress.” In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \nAnd an agency action must be both “reasonable and reasonably explained,” Ohio v. EPA, \n603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024); if it is not, it is “unlawful” and “shall be . . . set aside,” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. For the following reasons, EPA has violated the Administrative Procedures Act, \nand Plaintiffs are entitled to an order setting aside the grant terminations.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 3 of 48\n \nTable of Contents \nI.

BACKGROUND \nA.  Congress’s Mandate to EPA \nIn August 2022, Congress amended the Clean Air Act by enacting the \n“Environmental and climate justice block grants” statute as part of the Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022. 42 U.S.C. § 7438. Congress appropriated $2.8 billion to “award \ngrants for the activities described in [§ 7438(b)],” and another $200 million for \n“technical assistance to eligible entities related to grants awarded under this section.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 7438(a). Congress then set forth the following statutory mandate: “The \nAdministrator [EPA] shall use amounts made available under subsection (a)(1) to award \ngrants for periods of up to 3 years to eligible entities to carry out activities described in \nparagraph (2) that benefit disadvantaged communities, as defined by the \nAdministrator.” Id. § 7438(b)(1). Congress defined “eligible entities” to include \n“community-based nonprofit organization[s]” as well as partnerships among such \norganizations, or between such organizations and “an Indian tribe, a local government, \nor an institution of higher education.” Id. § 7438(c).  \nCongress directed EPA to use the funds for specified programs: \n(A)  community-led  air  and  other  pollution  monitoring, \nprevention, and remediation, and investments in low- and \nzero-emission  and  resilient  technologies  and  related \ninfrastructure and workforce development that help reduce \ngreenhouse gas1 emissions and other air pollutants; \n \n(B)  mitigating  climate  and  health  risks  from  urban  heat \nislands, extreme heat, wood heater emissions, and wildfire \nevents; \n \n1 Congress defined “greenhouse gas” to mean “the air pollutants carbon dioxide, \nhydrofluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur \nhexafluoride.” 42 U.S.C. § 7438(d).  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 5 of 48\n \n(C) climate resiliency and adaptation; \n \n(D) reducing indoor toxics and indoor air pollution; or \n \n(E) facilitating engagement of disadvantaged communities in \nState and Federal advisory groups, workshops, rulemakings, \nand other public processes. \n \nId. § 7438(b)(2).  \nB. The Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program  \nPursuant to its authority under § 7438, EPA announced the Environmental \nJustice Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program in February 2023. ECF No. 2-3. It \nissued a “solicitation” to “request applications for the design and management of a new \nEnvironmental Justice (EJ) competitive pass-through program where EPA will \ncompetitively select multiple pass-through entities to provide grant funds via subawards \nto community-based nonprofit organizations and other eligible subrecipient groups \nrepresenting underserved and disadvantaged communities.” Id. at 3.2 EPA explained \nthat it was electing to use a “passthrough model” to “remove[] the requirement” that \npotential grantees “apply[] through the federal grants process,” which can be “very time-\nconsuming” and “a significant barrier to entry,” especially for smaller organizations. Id. \nat 6. EPA considered a passthrough model to be “a more effective approach to providing \nsmaller funding amounts to communities for the initial development of their \nenvironmental justice projects.” Id. EPA explained that Grantmakers would “collaborate \nwith EPA to design and build their own processes to receive and evaluate competitive \n \n2 Page numbers herein refer to the ECF pagination in the header of the parties’ filings. \nThose page numbers do not necessarily align with the documents’ original page \nnumbers. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 6 of 48\ncommunity project applications from communities for EJ Thriving Communities \nSubgrants.” Id. at 7. \nAccordingly, the first step in implementing its obligations under § 7438 was for \nEPA to select Regional Grantmakers for each of EPA’s ten regions, as well as a “national” \ngrantmaker to “fill gaps and potential needs that other Grantmakers may not have the \nability to cover.” See ECF No. 2-3 at 17-18. The solicitation explained that the authority \nfor the grants was § 7438, and that EPA was required to direct the grant funding to \n“projects to benefit disadvantaged communities.” Id. at 5. The solicitation noted that \nEPA was “in the process of defining the term disadvantaged communities,’” id. at 4 n.2, \nbut explained that EPA understood Congress’s mandate to require “new and innovative \nstrategies and approaches,” “especially . . . for underserved and disadvantaged \ncommunities that have [been], and continue to be, plagued by environmental pollution \nand health, and environmental justice, challenges.” Id. at 5. EPA further explained,  \nThese communities are often exposed to unhealthy land uses, \npoor air and water quality, dilapidated housing that leads to \nlead exposure, and other environmental threats that drive \nhealth  disparities.  Many  of  these  communities  are  also \nsurrounded  by  social  inequities  such  as  job  insecurity, \nunderemployment,  linguistic  isolation,  underperforming \nschools, noise pollution, crowded homes, face high energy \nburden or fossil fuel dependence, and lack access to healthy \nfoods  and  transportation.  In  addition,  they  often  lack \nadequate  resources  and  experience  to  navigate  complex \nFederal grant application and award making processes and \nhave been limited in their ability to have meaningful access to, \nand  participation  in,  governmental  decision-making \nprocesses  that  affect  them,  including  those  relating  to \nenvironmental  health  and  justice.  The  combination  of \nenvironmental  risks  and  social  inequities  creates  a \ncumulative,  disproportionate  impact  that  hinders  optimal \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 7 of 48\nenvironmental  health  and  justice  particularly  for  these \ncommunities. \n \nId. at 6.  \n  In December 2023, EPA announced its selections, and designated Plaintiffs as \nRegional Grantmakers: GHHI for EPA Region 3 (Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C., and seven federally recognized tribes), \nECF No. 2-2 ¶¶ 6–7; Minneapolis Foundation for EPA Region 5 (Indiana, Illinois, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, and 37 federally recognized tribes), ECF \nNo. 2-14 ¶ 8; and Philanthropy Northwest for EPA Region 10 (Alaska, Idaho, \nOregon, and Washington, and 271 tribal nations), ECF No. 2-24 ¶¶ 9–10.  \nIn mid-2024, EPA awarded each organization a three-year, $8 million “initial \ngrant.” See ECF No. 2-1 at 12. EPA designated these initial grants to support expanded \nstaffing, regionwide outreach to community-based organizations, and the development \nand administration of a grant application process in each region, as well as to provide \ntechnical assistance and initial oversight to subgrant applicants and subgrantees. Id. at \n12-13. \nEPA then awarded each organization a “subsequent grant” in the amount of $52 \nmillion. Id. at 13. EPA directed Plaintiffs to use $48 million from those grants to award \nsubgrants; the balance was permitted to cover Plaintiffs’ administrative costs. Id.; see \nalso 42 U.S.C. § 7438(c) (“The Administrator shall reserve 7 percent of the amounts \nmade available under subsection (a) for administrative costs to carry out this section.”).  \nEach Thriving Communities grant is governed by a Cooperative Agreement: ECF \nNo. 2-5 (GHHI, May 3, 2024); ECF No. 2-15 (Minneapolis Foundation, June 24, 2024); \nECF No. 2-25 (Philanthropy Northwest, June 14, 2024). Those agreements incorporate \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 8 of 48\nGeneral Terms and Conditions issued by EPA. See, e.g., ECF No. 2-5 at 6. Those EPA \nGeneral Terms and Conditions, the relevant version of which became effective October \n1, 2023, permit EPA to terminate grants as follows:  \nConsistent  with  2  CFR  200.340,  EPA  may  unilaterally \nterminate this award in whole or in part: \n \n(a) If a recipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions \nof  the  award  including  statutory  or  regulatory \nrequirements; or \n  \n(b) If the award no longer effectuates the program goals or \nagency priorities. Situations in which EPA may terminate \nan award under this provision include when: \ni.  EPA  obtains  evidence  that  was  not  considered  in \nmaking  the  award  that  reveals  that  specific  award \nobjective(s) are ineffective at achieving program goals \nand  EPA  determines  that  it  is  in  the  government’s \ninterest to terminate the award; \nii.  EPA  obtains  evidence  that  was  not  considered  in \nmaking  the  award  that  causes  EPA  to  significantly \nquestion the feasibility of the intended objective(s) of \nthe  award  and  EPA  determines  that  it  is  in  the \ngovernment’s interest to terminate the award;  \niii. EPA determines that the objectives of the award are no \nlonger consistent with funding priorities for achieving \nprogram goals. \n \nECF No. 2-13 at 3–4.  \n  Those general terms and conditions track the referenced C.F.R. provision, which \nis an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulation that provides that a federal \naward “may be terminated in part or its entirety” including, “to the extent authorized by \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 9 of 48\nlaw, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” 2 C.F.R. § \n200.340(a).3  \nC. EPA’s Termination of Plaintiffs’ Grants  \n  Upon being selected as Regional Grantmakers for the Thriving Communities \nprogram, Plaintiffs proceeded to conduct extensive work to administer the program, \nincluding hiring staff, developing partnerships, standing up systems and policies, \nconducting extensive assessments and strategic planning on how to best effectuate \nCongress’s mandate and EPA’s guidance, and preparing to select sub-grantees, disburse \nfunds, and oversee implementation. And by the time EPA terminated Plaintiffs’ initial \ngrants in February 2025, each Plaintiff had conducted a first round of selections of sub-\ngrantees. ECF No. 2-2 ¶ 20; ECF No. 2-14 ¶ 30-33; ECF No. 2-24 ¶ 39.  \n  That all came to a halt when EPA issued the terminations at issue, on February 21 \nand 22, 2025. EPA sent each organization an Assistance Amendment to the Cooperative \n \n3 Plaintiffs argue that the EPA General Terms and Conditions narrowed the permissible \ngrounds for terminating grants to cover only a subset of the grounds authorized by the \nOMB regulation. OMB authorizes termination of grants where an award “no longer \neffectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). The EPA \nterms and conditions do too: “EPA may unilaterally terminate this award in whole or in \npart . . . [i]f the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” ECF \nNo. 2-13 at 4. The EPA terms and conditions go on to identify some examples of \n“[s]ituations in which EPA may terminate an award under this provision,” and those \nexamples are specific and focus on whether an award remains “effective” at achieving \nprogram goals, or whether the “intended objective(s) of the award” are “feasible” or \nremain “consistent with funding priorities for achieving program goals.” Id. Plaintiffs \nargue that, by including those examples, EPA effectively disclaimed a right to terminate \ngrants based on a change in “agency priorities.” ECF No. 2-1 at 37-39. Not so. The EPA \nterms and conditions are congruent with 2 C.F.R. § 200.340; not only do the EPA terms \nand conditions expressly authorize terminating awards that “no longer effectuate[] . . . \nagency priorities” but the EPA terms and conditions expressly incorporate 2 C.F.R. § \n200.340. ECF No. 2-13 at 3–4. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 10 of 48\nAgreement governing the organization’s initial grant, and a memorandum from each \norganization’s “EPA Award Official.” The Assistance Amendments did not contain any \nexplanation for the terminations. Instead, they stated in pertinent part as follows: \nThis amendment is to stop work; terminate the agreement; \nreduce performance period duration; curtail scope of work; \nand  waive  certain  reporting  requirements.  Administrative \nterms and conditions are added. \n \nPer 2 CFR 200.340 and the Termination General Terms and \nConditions of this agreement, EPA is terminating this award. \nYour organization shall immediately stop work and take all \nreasonable  steps  to  minimize  the  incurrence  of  costs \notherwise allocable to the assistance agreement. See terms \nand conditions. \n. . .  \nBased on your Application dated 04/16/2024 including all \nmodifications and amendments, the United States acting by \nand through the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nhereby awards $ 0.00.  \n \nECF No. 2-10 at 2 (GHHI); see also ECF No. 2-18 at 4 (Minneapolis Foundation); ECF \nNo. 2-28 at 4 (Philanthropy Northwest). The Assistance Amendment invoked 2 CFR \n200.340 as the authority for the termination, e.g., ECF No. 2-10 at 5, and noted the \nfollowing regarding disputes over the terminations:  \nIf  the  recipient  disagrees  with  the  terms  and  conditions \nspecified in this award, the authorized representative of the \nrecipient must furnish a notice of disagreement to the EPA \nAward  Official  within  21  days  after  the  EPA  award  or \namendment mailing date. In case of disagreement, and until \nthe disagreement is resolved, the recipient should not draw \ndown on the funds provided by this award/amendment, and \nany costs incurred by the recipient are at its own risk. This \nagreement  is  subject  to  applicable  EPA  regulatory  and \nstatutory  provisions,  all  terms  and  conditions  of  this \nagreement and any attachments. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 11 of 48\nECF No. 2-10 at 2; ECF No. 2-18 at 4; ECF No. 2-28 at 4.  \n  To the extent EPA has explained the basis for the terminations, that explanation \nappears in the Termination Memoranda issued to each Plaintiff. The three letters, also \nsent February 21 and 22, are materially identical, and state in pertinent part as follows:  \nThe purpose of this communication is to notify you that the \nU.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  is  hereby \nterminating Assistance Agreement No. 5N-95341301 awarded \nto Green & Healthy Homes Initiative, Inc. In accordance with \n2 CFR 200.340(a)(2) (effective August 13, 2020 – September \n30, 2024) and the Termination term and condition contained \nin the EPA General Terms and Conditions effective August 13, \n2020 – September 30, 2024, EPA Assistance Agreement 5N-\n95341301 is terminated in its entirety effective immediately \non  the  grounds  that  the  award  no  longer  effectuates  the \nprogram  goals  or  agency  priorities.  The  objectives  of  the \naward are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities. \n \nIt is a priority of the EPA to eliminate discrimination in all \nprograms  throughout  the  United  States.  The  EPA \nAdministrator  has  determined  that,  per  the  Agency’s \nobligations  to  the  constitutional  and  statutory  law  of  the \nUnited  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nAgency’s grants do not support programs or organizations \nthat promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion \n(“DEI”)  initiatives,  “environmental  justice”  initiatives,  and \nconflict with the Agency’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand  excellence  in  performing  our  statutory  functions.  In \naddition to complying with the civil rights laws, it is vital that \nthe Agency assess whether all grant payments are free from \nfraud,  abuse,  waste,  and  duplication,  as  well  as  to  assess \nwhether current grants are in the best interests of the United \nStates. \n \nThe grant specified above provides funding for programs that \npromote  or  take  part  in  DEI  initiatives  or  environmental \njustice initiatives or other initiatives that conflict with the \nAgency’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence \nin performing our statutory functions; that are not free from \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 12 of 48\nfraud, abuse, waste, or duplication; or that otherwise fail to \nserve the best interests of the United States. The grant is \ntherefore inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Agency \npriorities. \n \nE.g., ECF No. 2-9 at 2 (GHHI); see also ECF No. 2-18 at 2 (Minneapolis Foundation); \nECF No. 2-28 at 2 (Philanthropy Northwest).  \n  Those February 20 and 21, 2025, letters terminated each Plaintiff’s initial $8 \nmillion Thriving Communities grants and suspended their access to subsequent grant \nfunds. See, e.g., ECF No. 2-11 at 2, 4 (as of March 21, 2025, GHHI’s grants listed as \n“[s]uspended”). Since then, EPA has also terminated the subsequent grants. ECF Nos. \n28 & 32. The May 2025 letters terminating the subsequent grants contain even less \nexplanation than the February 2025 letters terminating the initial grants. The May \nletters state as follows: \nThe purpose of this communication is to notify you that the \nU.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  is  hereby \nterminating Assistance Agreement No. 5N-95341401 awarded \nto Green & Healthy Homes Initiative Inc. This EPA Assistance \nAgreement  is  terminated  effective  immediately  on  the \ngrounds that the remaining portion of the Federal award will \nnot  accomplish  the  EPA  funding  priorities  for  achieving \nprogram goals. The objectives of the award are no longer \nconsistent with EPA funding priorities. \n \nThe EPA Administrator has determined that, per the Agency’s \nobligations  to  the  constitutional  and  statutory  law  of  the \nUnited  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nAgency’s grants do not conflict with the Agency’s policy of \nprioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in performing our \nstatutory functions. In addition to complying with the law, it \nis vital that the Agency assess whether all grant payments are \nfree from fraud, abuse, waste, and duplication, as well as to \nassess whether current grants are in the best interests of the \nUnited States. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 13 of 48\n \nECF No. 28-3 (GHHI); see also ECF No. 28-1 at 2 (Minneapolis Foundation); ECF No. \n32-1 at 2 (Philanthropy Northwest).  \n  At the hearing on Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion, Plaintiffs \nrepresented, on information and belief, that EPA had terminated all of the Regional \nGrantmakers’ initial grants. In other words, EPA has, at least for now, effectively \nshuttered a program that Congress created, that Congress mandated EPA to administer, \nand that Congress funded through specific appropriations.  \nD. EPA’s Process for Terminating These Grants \nUnder the Administrative Procedures Act, the process EPA employed in deciding \non the agency action at issue is central to the analysis. As discussed above, any such \nprocess must be both “reasonable and reasonably explained.” Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. at \n292. If it is not, the law considers it to be “arbitrary” or “capricious,” id. at 293, and thus \n“unlawful” and required to be “set aside,” 5 U.S.C. § 706. To the extent the \nadministrative record in this case (filed at ECF Nos. 36, 40-2, and 40-3) reflects any \ndeliberative process by EPA in deciding to terminate these grants, it is the following.  \nOn January 21, 2025, the director of EPA’s Office of Grants and Debarment \nemailed another employee requesting that she “identify all OEJECR grant awards” \nincluding “award amount, amount obligated, and amount expended.” ECF No. 40-3 at 3. \n“EOJECR” refers to the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights. The \nemployee reported back later that day that that “Action Task” was “done.” Id. at 2.  \nOn February 11, 2025, another EPA employee, Kathryn Loving,4 sent an email to \n \n4 Other than as stated herein, the record does not reflect the titles or responsibilities of \nthe individuals in these email chains. Based on one email chain it appears that at least \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 14 of 48\ntwo other EPA employees, sharing a link to a document entitled “contract details.” ECF \nNo. 36-1 at 154. She wrote, “Hi Travis, as we discussed today, here’s a list of contracts \nand grants that we want to push forward to cancellation, and keep the momentum \ngoing! We removed the ones we thought were yellow flags, so we think these are pretty \nuncontroversial, but we added a column ‘AO reviewed’, for your team to add any \ngreenlight or flags. Thanks! Kathryn.” Id. That version of the “contract details” \nspreadsheet is not in the record, and there is no evidence in the record of the substance \nof the “discuss[ion]” that Ms. Loving referred to, or what process was entailed by the \nreferenced “AO review[].” The next day she wrote, “In addition, we added a new tab ‘Feb \n12 contracts to cancel’ with a new tranche of contracts we found today.” Id.  \nThe spreadsheets these individuals were circulating contained various columns, \nsuch “Date Cancellation Process Started,” grant identification or account numbers, \nrecipient names, and grant amounts. See, e.g., id. at 149. Another column identified \nwhether notice-and-comment rulemaking would be required to cancel the grants (which \nis not at issue here; Plaintiffs do not contend that notice-and-comment rulemaking was \nrequired). Id. The only column pertinent to this case is a column entitled “Rationale.” \nDepending on the contract, the entire extent of any “Rationale” reflected on these \nspreadsheets is a few words at most: (1) “Environmental justice work” (later revised to \nread “Program not in line with administration priorities: 66.615 - Environmental Justice \nSubawards”), (2) “DEI EO issues,” or (3) “Wasteful.” See, e.g., id. at 149–53. (“66.615” is \nEPA’s “assistance listing code” for the Thriving Communities program. See ECF No. 36-\n \nMs. Loving is associated with the “Department of Government Efficiency” See ECF No. \n36-1 at 154. In any event, the Court refers to each of these individuals (including Ms. \nLoving) as EPA employees because they have “epa.gov” email addresses. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 15 of 48\n1 at 7.) \nOn February 13, EPA employee Travis Voyles wrote,  \nThank you so much! This is really helpful. Paige and I had a \ngood discussion with the Administrator last night reviewing \nthe examples and process. One aspect he raised that we just \nwant to ensure we are covering when taking the action to \ncancel  that  we  are  doing  it  reflective  of  any \nterms/conditions/notification requirements in the contract or \ngrant. Is that something y’all feel you are able to capture in \nyour  review  or  we  can  engage  OMS  [Office  of  Mission \nSupport] to quickly get us that details. Otherwise he liked the \nprocess and agrees that we’ll be able to quickly move through \nreviewing these once that element is addressed. \n \nId. at 154. There is no memorandum or other record of the “discussion with the \nAdministrator” this email refers to. \nMs. Loving responded,  \nI have added a column “T&C” that indicates no notice and \ncomment period required for the contracts and grants we \nalready sent you. As you can imagine, the DOGE team has \nlawyers that are pretty experienced with grant and contract \ncancellation at this point, so that’s what that is based on! \n \nI  will  also  add  that  the  careers  in  EPA  OMS  are  already \nsupporting us on this – they are the ones who will be executing \nthe cancellation on your greenlight, not us. They see no issues \nwith cancelling the Feb 11 list of contracts, and we’re sharing \nthe Feb 12 list with them now. They seem very knowledgeable \nabout this topic, so I think you should trust them on how to \ncancel properly! \n \nId. Despite the reference to “support[]” from the Office of Mission Support, there is no \nmemorandum or other record of analysis or deliberation by individuals in that office.  \n  Later in the day on February 13 (at 6:11 p.m.) she added the following:  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 16 of 48\nKeeping up the cadence today, we have added to the queue a \nlist of 71 grants that were all signed before July 1, 2024, worth \n$119M  (ceiling;  savings  will  be  lower  once  we  subtract \nobligations). The new tab is called “Feb 13 grants to cancel”. \n \nIt was great to put 5 of the “gold bars” on this list, that are \nsigned before July 1! (The majority of those were signed after \nJuly 1.) We have marked those 5 rows in blue, because gold is \ntoo hard to read. Total award value for those 5 is $36.9M, of \nwhich $27.8M has not yet been obligated. We are calling them \n“gold bars” because they were awards to grant makers who \nplan  to  give  subawards.  4  of  the  5  are  part  of  the \nThriving communities grantmaking program that \nLee cancelled part of earlier today. \n \nId.  The work continued later that night, apparently reflecting the speed at which the \nEPA employees were being directed to operate. At 10:18 p.m., Mr. Voyles emailed the \ngroup, “below is the test batch run that just got approved to cancel. We will go back into \nthe spreadsheet and mark these as ‘Approved to Cancel.’” Id. at 153.  \nOver the next week, these employees added some other grants to their \ncancellation tracking sheet. On Thursday, February 20, Mr. Voyles wrote, \nBelow  are  the  next  set  of  approved  to  cancel  grants. \n$42,261,933 total in remaining funds it looks like, but OMS \ncan confirm. \n \nOne flag I have is the first few large ones are the EJ \nThriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers \n(TCTACs)— \nhttps://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/environmental-\njustice-thriving-communities-technical-assistance-centers. \nThere were 18 in total established, so a number of them are \nmissed here. Not sure why they didn’t all get captured (they \nmay not have all gone out yet), but I would want to apply \na broad approach and cancel them all in the vein the \nentire program is inconsistent with Adminstration \n[sic] priorities and I personally do not see the need \nfor  these  because  at  the  state-level,  EPA  and  the \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 17 of 48\nTCTAC grantees refused to engage with the state in \nany kind of coordination. This should result in a larger \n$$ amount \n \nId. at 149 (emphases added).  \nAt 10:37 a.m., he then recirculated the spreadsheet, this time listing the GHHI, \nPhilanthropy Northwest, and Minneapolis Foundation grants. The entire extent of any \n“rationale” this team had identified for terminating Plaintiffs’ grants is this: “Program \nnot in line with administration priorities: 66.615 - Environmental Justice subawards.” \nId. at 148–49. Unlike for other grant cancellations being discussed in this email chain, \nEPA did not identify “DEI EO issues” or “Wasteful” in the “Rationale” column for the \nGHHI, Philanthropy Northwest, and Minneapolis Foundation cancellations.  \nAt 11:12 a.m., Ms. Loving forwarded the list to another employee to “submit[] the \ncancellation requests.” Id. at 148. At 12:25 p.m., an EPA employee, Daniel Coogan, \nemailed another EPA employee, Melissa Wise, stating, “Melissa, can we please begin \nworking with the GMOs [Grants Management Officers] to terminate the following 22 \ngrants. I received direction from political leadership that we are to cancel these.” ECF \nNo. 40-2 at 4.  \nTo effectuate the terminations, EPA employees used a template form letter. ECF \nNo 36-1 at 172.5 The template contains all of the language that appeared in the \ntermination memoranda that Plaintiffs received; the only changeable fields in the \n \n5 Although the version of the template appearing on that page contains a date of May 9, \n2025, EPA explains that the template “exists with EPA’s records as a Word (e.g., .doc or \n.docx) file with a template date field,” and when EPA converted the document to PDF to \nfile on the court’s CM/ECF system, that “resulted in the template date field updating to \nthe date of conversion”; in fact, “[i]n its Word file version, this document is dated \nFebruary 21, 2025.” ECF No. 36-1 at 3 n.1.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 18 of 48\ntemplate are the grant recipient’s name, the grant number, and the contact information \nfor the pertinent EPA official. Id. at 172–73.  \nThe next day or the following day (February 21 or 22), EPA populated the missing \nfields from the template letter, and sent the first termination notices to Plaintiffs (ECF \nNo. 2-10 at 2; ECF No. 2-18 at 4; ECF No. 2-28 at 4), along with the termination \nmemoranda (ECF No. 2-9 at 2; ECF No. 2-18 at 2; ECF No. 2-28 at 2).  \nE. This Case  \nPlaintiffs filed this case on April 2, 2025, challenging these grant terminations. \nThe complaint asserts five causes of action. \nCount 1 alleges that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious in violation of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Plaintiffs articulated their \ncontention in Count 1 as follows:  \nEPA  identified  three  vague  and  baseless  grounds  for  its \nactions:  (1)  because  the  grant  awards  are  purportedly \ninconsistent with EPA’s newly-adopted “Agency priority” to \nwithdraw financial support from “organizations that promote \nor take part in … ‘DEI’ [or] ‘environmental justice’ initiatives”; \n(2)  because  the  organizations’  grant-funded  programs  are \npurportedly  not  be  “free  from  fraud,  abuse,  waste,  or \nduplication”;  or  (3)  because  the  organizations’  programs \nallegedly “otherwise fail to serve the best  interests of the \nUnited States.” EPA’s stated reasons for termination of the \ngrants are so varied and ambiguous that the statement is \nmeaningless. The Agency gave no legitimate reason for its \nactions.  \n \nEPA provided no rationale for its actions beyond this vague \nand unsubstantiated statement. The Agency did not identify \nany evidence, find any facts, or supply any reasoning that \nwould support any of its three stated reasons for terminating \nthe grants. With respect to EPA’s newly adopted “Agency \npriority” to withhold financial support from “organizations \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 19 of 48\nthat promote or take part in . . . ‘DEI’ [or] ‘environmental \njustice’  initiatives,”  EPA  has  not  identified  any  offending \n“initiatives” that it believes the Plaintiff Organizations have \n“promote[d],” or in which it believes the organizations have \n“take[n] part.” EPA has not pointed to any evidence on which \na  finding  of  “promoting  or  taking  part  in”  disfavored \n“initiatives”  could  be  based.  EPA  has  not  identified  the \n“constitutional and statutory law of the United States” that it \nclaims  forms  the  basis  for  its  newly  declared  “Agency \npriority.” The Agency has not even defined the terms “DEI” or \n“environmental justice.” \n \nMeanwhile,  EPA’s  invocations  of  “fraud,  waste,  abuse  or \nduplication” and “the best interests of the United States” are \npure boilerplate. The Agency does not supply even a hint of \nanything that it might be referencing. \n \nSimply put, EPA’s actions here, in addition to being unlawful \nand  unconstitutional,  are  a  paradigm  of  arbitrary  and \ncapricious Agency action constituting an improper abuse of \ndiscretion as those terms are used in the APA. \n \nECF No. 1 ¶¶ 84-87.  \n  Count 2 alleges that the terminations were “in excess of [EPA’s] statutory . . . \nauthority” in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). Plaintiffs articulated why:  \nEPA and Administrator Zeldin had no statutory authority to \nterminate the grants or suspend access to grant funding on \nthis basis. In the Clean Air Act, Congress did not confer any \ndiscretion on the Agency to determine that its own “priorities” \nno longer match those of Congress and on that basis to decline \nto  fund  environmental  protection  activities  that  benefit \ndisadvantaged communities. To the contrary, the Clean Air \nAct unambiguously provides that the EPA and Administrator \nZeldin  “shall  use”  appropriated  amounts  to  fund \n“environmental  justice”  initiatives.  The  Agency  and  its \nAdministrator, in declaring it an “Agency priority” not to fund \nsuch initiatives, have acted in defiance of that congressional \ndirection. \n \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 20 of 48\nECF No. 1 ¶ 95.  \n  Counts 3 and 4 allege that the terminations violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nFirst and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Count 3 asserts a direct claim, \nseeking a declaratory judgment that the terminations violate the First and Fifth \nAmendments. Id. ¶¶ 99-105. Count 4 alleges that, if the terminations are \nunconstitutional, EPA violated APA § 706(2)(B), which applies to agency actions that \nare “contrary to constitutional right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). Plaintiffs articulate their \nFirst Amendment claim as follows: \nIn terminating the Thriving Communities initial grants that it \nhad previously awarded to the Plaintiff Organizations, EPA \ndeclared it an “Agency priority” to ensure “that the Agency’s \ngrants do not support . . . organizations that promote or take \npart in diversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives [or] \n‘environmental justice’ initiatives.” In so stating, EPA has \nacknowledged engaging in viewpoint discrimination. \n \nThe  First  Amendment  prohibits  EPA  and  Administrator \nZeldin from terminating grants or suspending grant funding \nbased  on  their  perception  that  the  Plaintiff  Organizations \n“promote”  or  “take  part  in”  viewpoints  with  regard  to \n“environmental justice” that the government now disfavors. \nMoreover,  the  First  Amendment  protects  the  Plaintiff \nOrganizations’ advocacy for and on behalf of disadvantaged \ncommunities. \n \nECF No. 1 ¶¶ 100-101. Plaintiffs articulate their Fifth Amendment claim as follows:  \nThe Fifth Amendment prohibits “depriv[ations] of life, liberty, \nor property without due process of law. \n \nIn terminating the Plaintiff Organizations’ initial grant award \nand  suspending  their  access  to  subsequent  grant  funds \nwithout any legitimate reason, EPA and Administrator Zeldin \nhave violated Plaintiffs’ due process rights.  \nId. ¶¶ 102-103. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 21 of 48\n  Count 5 alleges that EPA’s terminations also are unlawful and should be set aside \nas “not in accordance with law” or “without observance of procedure required by law,” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A) & (D), because they violate OMB regulations “limiting the \ncircumstances under which a federal agency may terminate a grant award.” ECF No. 1 ¶ \n116 (citing 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340, .341). Plaintiffs specifically allege that the terminations \nviolate OMB regulations for two reasons: (1) EPA “failed to provide a meaningful \nstatement of its ‘reasons for termination,’” ECF No. 1 ¶ 117, and (2) although the terms \nand conditions that accompanied the EPA grants authorized EPA to “unilaterally \nterminate this award in whole or in part . . . [i]f the award no longer effectuates the \nprogram goals or agency priorities,” the “[s]ituations” that EPA identified as “included” \nin that authority did not include changes in “agency priorities.” Id. ¶¶ 117-22; see also \nECF No. 2-13 at 3-4 (referenced terms and conditions).  \n  As relief, Plaintiffs requested in their complaint that the Court (A) “postpone the \neffective date of the EPA’s termination of Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities initial grant \nawards, pending final judicial review”; (B) “hold unlawful and set aside” those \nterminations and suspensions as “arbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory \nauthority, contrary to constitutional right, not in accordance with law, and without \nobservance of procedure required by law”; (C) issue a declaratory judgment that the \nterminations and suspensions are unlawful; and (D) order that EPA “reinstate Plaintiffs’ \nThriving Communities initial grant awards.” ECF No. 1 at 33.  \n  Plaintiffs accompanied their complaint with a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction requiring that EPA “reinstate Plaintiffs’ Thriving Communities ‘initial grants’ \nand restore Plaintiffs’ access to the funds awarded in their Thriving Communities \n‘subsequent grants,’ thereby returning the parties to the status quo prior to Defendants’ \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 22 of 48\ntermination and suspension of those grants,” and enjoining EPA from “terminating, \nsuspending, or freezing access to funds under any of the Plaintiffs’ Thriving \nCommunities grants.” ECF No. 2-31 (Plaintiffs’ proposed preliminary injunction). The \nCourt held a preliminary injunction hearing on April 29, 2025, and took the motion \nunder advisement. During the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction, the \nCourt ordered that Defendants file the administrative record by May 13, 2025, ECF No. \n29, which the Defendants did, ECF No. 36-1. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary \njudgment, ECF No. 41, and Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, \nmotion to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims, or in the alternative, a motion \nfor summary judgment, ECF No. 44. Both parties filed response briefs. ECF Nos. 46, 48. \nThe Court held a summary judgment hearing on May 30, 2025. ECF No. 50.  \n  As explained in greater detail below, Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ motions (and \nmove to dismiss and/or transfer this case) on a number of grounds. They argue this \nCourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims and that the Court of \nFederal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491. \nECF No. 44-1 at 13-25. On the merits, Defendants contend that EPA can lawfully decline \nto fund the “Environmental and climate justice block grants” program mandated by 42 \nU.S.C. § 7438, or at minimum suspend the program and reorient the funding pursuant \nto the current administration’s “funding priorities.” They argue the grant terminations \nare “committed to agency discretion by law” and therefore unreviewable under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2), and in any event were not arbitrary and capricious. ECF No. 44-1 at 32-33. \nThey argue Plaintiffs have not stated a cognizable First Amendment claim because \n“[t]he Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to \nencourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at the same \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 23 of 48\ntime funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in another \nway.” ECF No. 22 at 22 (quoting Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 193 (1991)). And they \nargue that if EPA’s reasoning or explanation for the terminations was deficient, at most \nthe Court should “remand the matter back to EPA to provide a more detailed \nexplanation for each grant termination on an expedited schedule.” Id. at 27.  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n“Because claims brought under the APA are adjudicated without a trial or \ndiscovery, on the basis of an existing administrative record, such claims are properly \ndecided on summary judgment.” Audobon Naturalist Society of the Central Atlantic \nStates, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Transportation, 524 F. Supp. 2d 642, 660 (D. Md. 2007) \n(citing Citizens for the Scenic Severn River Bridge, Inc. v. Skinner, 802 F. Supp. 1325, \n1332 (D. Md. 1991), aff’d, 1992 WL 180138 (4th Cir. July 29, 1992). Summary judgment \nis appropriate when “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant \nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In determining whether \nthe moving party has made that showing, the Court must consider the facts and all \nreasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \nparty. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). \nWhere, as here, there are cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court must \n“evaluate each party’s motion on its own merits, taking care in each instance to draw all \nreasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.” Bollech \nv. Charles Cnty., 69 F. App’x 178, 180 (4th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 24 of 48\nIII.  JURISDICTIONAL MATTERS \nA. Subject Matter Jurisdiction \n  Before turning to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, this Court must “first \ndetermin[e] that it has jurisdiction over the category of claim in suit.” Sinochem Int’l Co. \nv. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 431 (2007). “The United States is \nimmune from suit unless it unequivocally consents.” Maine Cmty. Health Options v. \nUnited States, 590 U.S. 296, 322 (2020). The parties agree that the United States has \nwaived immunity for claims such as Plaintiffs’, but they disagree on which authority \nprovides that waiver. Plaintiffs contend that the Government has waived its sovereign \nimmunity pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act because Plaintiffs allege that \nthey have been “aggrieved by agency action” and they “seek[] relief other than money \ndamages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. EPA disagrees, arguing that Plaintiffs are in fact seeking \nmoney damages pursuant to a contract, so the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, under which \nthe Court of Federal Claims would have exclusive jurisdiction, applies. See 28 U.S.C. § \n1491(a)(1) (“The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render \njudgment upon any claim against the United States founded” on “any express or implied \ncontract with the United States.”); Portsmouth Redevelopment & Hous. Auth. v. Pierce, \n706 F.2d 471, 473 (4th Cir. 1983) (explaining that when such a claim exceeds $10,000, \nthe Court of Federal Claims’ jurisdiction is exclusive). Courts across the country have \nbeen wrestling with this issue in grant-termination cases.  \n  The parties agree that the controlling question for whether this Court has subject \nmatter jurisdiction turns on whether this action is “‘at its essence’ a contract action,” \nwhich in turn depends on (1) “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its \nclaims,” and (2) “the type of relief sought.” Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 25 of 48\n(D.C. Cir. 1982). In performing this analysis, this Court “must look beyond the form of \nthe pleadings to the substance of the claim.” Suburban Mortg. Assocs., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Hous. & Urb. Dev., 480 F.3d 1116, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Plaintiffs contend that the \nsource of the rights upon which they base their claims are the Constitution, statutes, and \nregulations—not the terms of the grants themselves. ECF No. 48 at 13-15. They assert \nthat the type of relief they seek is equitable and designed to clarify EPA’s obligations on \na prospective basis—not an award of money damages. Id. at 16-17. EPA asserts that the \nsource of Plaintiffs’ claims is the language and provisions in the grant agreements, and \nthat because Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the grants, they should be deemed to be \nseeking money damages. ECF No. 44-1 at 16-21.  \n  As for the first question, the source of the allegedly violated rights, EPA contends \nthat because Plaintiffs refer to the terms of the grants in their complaint and attached \nthe grants thereto, those terms are the source of the rights Plaintiffs allege have been \nviolated. But the fact that Plaintiffs’ complaint refers to contractual terms is not \ndeterminative; “[c]ontract issues may arise in various types of cases where the action \nitself is not founded on a contract.” Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968; see also Normandy \nApartments, Ltd. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 554 F.3d 1290, 1300 (10th Cir. \n2009) (“When the source of rights asserted is constitutional, statutory, or regulatory in \nnature, the fact that resolution of the claim requires some reference to contract does not \nmagically ‘transform [the] action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the court of \njurisdiction it might otherwise have.’”) (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968); Robbins \nv. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 438 F.3d 1074, 1083-84 (10th Cir. 2006) (“[L]itigants \nmay bring statutory and constitutional claims in federal district court even when the \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 26 of 48\nclaims depend on the existence and terms of a contract with the government.”) (citation \nomitted). \n   Here, after careful review of the complaint, this Court concludes that, under these \nfacts, Plaintiffs are not alleging violations of the terms of the grants, but instead are \nasserting constitutional, statutory, and regulatory violations, including that EPA acted \narbitrarily and capriciously when terminating and suspending the grants without \nadequate reasoning (Count 1), acted in excess of the authority provided by the Clean Air \nAct (Count 2), violated the First and Fifth Amendments by terminating the grants \nwithout due process based on viewpoints EPA no longer wishes to support (Counts 3 & \n4), and failed to adhere to agency regulations that limit when an agency can terminate a \ngrant award (Count 5). ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 79-124. These do not appear to be artfully drafted \npleadings cloaking contract claims as something else. The “essence” of the action alleges \nconstitutional, statutory, and regulatory violations, not breaches of contract, even \nthough the case involves grants that are arguably contracts under these particular facts. \nMegapulse, 672 F.2d at 968. As the D.C. Circuit put it in Crowley Government Services, \nInc. v. General Services Administration, “the sources of Crowley’s claimed right are the \nstatutes identified in Crowley’s complaint.” 38 F.4th. 1099, 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2022). So too \nhere: although Plaintiffs’ grant agreements gave them certain contractual rights, those \nare not the rights that Plaintiffs have brought this case to enforce. Rather, their claim is \nthat EPA has violated the APA, the Constitution, and OMB regulations; those are the \nsources of rights that are pertinent to this case.  \n  As for the second question, the type of relief sought, the parties have only cited \none precedential case on point: Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988). Bowen \ninvolved a refusal by the Secretary of Health and Human Services “to reimburse a State \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 27 of 48\nfor a category of expenditures under its Medicaid program.” Id. at 882. The Supreme \nCourt in Bowen concluded that the district court, rather than the Court of Federal \nClaims, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Id. at 883. The Bowen Court held that the \nplaintiff was not seeking money damages even though the relief sought involved the \npayment of money; instead, the plaintiff sought to enjoin the agency from reducing the \nsize of its federal grant. Id. at 893-94; see id. at 893 (“The fact that a judicial remedy \nmay require one party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to characterize \nthe relief as ‘money damages.’”). The Court reasoned that money damages “are given to \nthe plaintiff to substitute for a suffered loss, whereas specific remedies are not substitute \nremedies at all, but attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled.” \nId. at 895 (internal quotation marks omitted); Am.’s Cmty. Bankers v. F.D.I.C., 200 \nF.3d 822, 829 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“Where a plaintiff seeks an award of funds to which it \nclaims entitlement under a statute, the plaintiff seeks specific relief, not damages.”). \n“The crux of this inquiry . . . boils down to whether the plaintiff effectively seeks to attain \nmonetary damages in the suit,” which means jurisdiction lies in the Court of Federal \nClaims, or “declaratory or injunctive relief,” which means jurisdiction lies in a district \ncourt. Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107.  \n  EPA argues that because the relief sought by Plaintiffs necessarily involves \nmonetary relief, the relief should be classified as monetary damages. But this argument \nis incompatible with Bowen. 487 U.S. at 896 (rejecting the argument that all forms of \nmonetary relief are also monetary damages). EPA, for the first time in one of its recent \nnotices of supplemental authority, attempts to distinguish Bowen, arguing that Bowen \nis inapplicable because it involved a dispute between a state and the federal government \nand the relationship was not contractual. ECF No. 49 at 4 (citing Suburban Mortg. \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 28 of 48\nAssocs., Inc., 480 F.3d at 1127). In distinguishing Bowen, the Federal Circuit in \nSuburban Mortgage noted that Bowen involved an ongoing relationship in which the \nplaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, unlike in Suburban Mortgage, which \ndealt with a simple breach of an insurance contract. Suburban Mortg. Assocs., Inc., 480 \nF.3d at 1127. The present case is more like Bowen than Suburban Mortgage in that \nregard and this Court concludes that Bowen controls. Plaintiffs do not seek money as a \nsubstitute for a loss, Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895, or “specific sums already calculated, past \ndue, and designed to compensate for completed labors,” Maine Cmty. Health Options, \n590 U.S. at 327 (distinguishing Bowen). Instead, Plaintiffs seek equitable and \ndeclaratory relief regarding EPA’s obligations and Plaintiffs’ rights on a prospective \nbasis. Plaintiffs do not seek money damages.  \nVarious other courts have agreed, in similar circumstances. See, e.g., Maryland \nv. Corp. for Nat'l & Cmty. Serv., No. CV DLB-25-1363, 2025 WL 1585051, at *1, *23, *25 \n(D. Md. June 5, 2025) (holding that under Bowen and Megapulse, the Tucker Act did \nnot apply to a claim that AmeriCorps grants could not be terminated in the absence of \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking, because “[t]he grant terms are simply not relevant to \nthis case at all”;“[t]he source of the rights for the States’ notice-and-comment claims is a \nfederal statute”; and the “requested relief is equitable, not monetary”); Climate United \nFund v. Citibank, N.A., -- F. Supp. 3d ---, No. 25-CV-698 (TSC), 2025 WL 1131412, at \n*9-12 (D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2025) (holding that Tucker Act did not apply to claims that EPA \nviolated the APA and Constitution by terminating certain grants); Woonasquatucket \nRiver Watershed Council v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., -- F. Supp. 3d ---, No. 1:25-CV-00097-\nMSM-PAS, 2025 WL 1116157, at *14 (D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025) (holding that Tucker Act did \nnot apply to claims that agencies violated the APA in freezing certain grants and \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 29 of 48\ncontracts under two statutes)6; Chicago Women in Trades v. Trump, -- F. Supp. 3d ---, \nNo. 25 C 2005, 2025 WL 1114466, at *8-10 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 14, 2025) (holding that Tucker \nAct did not apply to claims that Department of Labor had violated “the First and Fifth \nAmendments, the Spending Clause, and the separation of powers” by terminating \ncertain grants and contracts); Maine v. United States Dep’t of Agric., -- F. Supp. 3d ---, \nNo. 1:25-CV-00131-JAW, 2025 WL 1088946, at *19 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2025) (holding that \nTucker Act did not apply to claims challenging agencies’ “compliance with the APA”); \nPacito v. Trump, No. 2:25-CV-255-JNW, 2025 WL 1077401, slip op. at *3 (W.D. Wash. \nApr. 9, 2025) (holding that Tucker Act did not apply to claims challenging termination \nof funding for United States Refugee Assistance Program because “Plaintiffs here assert \nrights derived from statutory mandates, not contractual promises, and seek equitable \nenforcement of statutory obligations, not contractual remedies”)7; Normandy \nApartments, 554 F.3d at 1296-1300 (holding that Tucker Act did not apply where \nplaintiff sought injunctive relief against HUD’s “attempts to terminate Housing \nAssistance Payments”).  \n  Courts in other cases have reached different conclusions, holding that certain \ngrant-termination claims belong in the Court of Federal Claims. EPA relies on the \nSupreme Court’s recent order granting a stay of a TRO “enjoining the Government from \nterminating various education-related grants.” Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. \n \n6 The district court partially stayed the proceedings (but not the preliminary injunction) \non May 30, 2025. Woonasquatucket River Watershed, 1:25-CV-00097-MSM-PAS, \n5/30/25 text order.  \n7 The Ninth Circuit partially stayed the preliminary injunction on March 25, 2025. \nPacito v. Trump, 25-1313 (9th Cir.), Doc. Nos. 28.1 & 113.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 30 of 48\n966, 968 (2025). In that order, the Supreme Court recognized that “a district court’s \njurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an agency’s \naction may result in the disbursement of funds.” Id. (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 910). \nBut it concluded that “the APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders \n‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’ along the lines of what the District \nCourt ordered here.” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. \nv. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212 (2002)).  \nHere, Plaintiffs do not seek to “enforce a contractual obligation to pay money,” \nbut rather seek a declaratory judgment that EPA has violated the Administrative \nProcedures Act and the Constitution, and relief including an order that EPA reinstate \nthe terminated grants based on EPA’s statutory and constitutional obligations. Bowen \nremains controlling, and no one contends it has been overruled. See Merrill v. Milligan, \n142 S. Ct. 879, 879 (2022) (A “stay order is not a ruling on the merits.”) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring). This Court will “follow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the \nSupreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.” Mallory v. Norfolk S. \nRy. Co., 600 U.S. 122, 136 (2023). \n  EPA also relies on Judge Griggsby’s recent opinions in Solutions in Hometown \nConnections v. Noem, which involved a decision by the Secretary of Homeland Security \n“to freeze, and later terminate, certain grants” issued by the United States Citizenship \nand Immigration Services to, among other things, “assist lawful permanent residents \nwith learning English, studying for the citizenship test and applying to be naturalized \ncitizens.” No. 25-CV-0885-LKG, 2025 WL 1530318, slip op. at *1 (D. Md. May 29, \n2025); see also 2025 WL 1103253, slip op. at *1 (D. Md. Apr. 14, 2025). In that case, \nJudge Griggsby concluded that the relief sought was actually money damages because \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 31 of 48\nthe plaintiffs had sought in their initial complaint and were seeking in their amended \ncomplaint “reimbursement for expenses already incurred under their Grants.” \nSolutions, 2025 WL 1530318, slip op. at *7; see also id. slip op. at *13 (concluding that \n“Plaintiffs primarily seek reimbursement for work already performed under their Grant \nAgreements”). Such relief would be akin to the specific past-due sums discussed in \nMaine Community Health Options, 590 U.S. at 327. Plaintiffs here do not seek \nreimbursement of funds already expended, or money damages “to substitute for a \nsuffered loss.” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895. Indeed, at the May 30 hearing, Plaintiffs’ counsel \nspecifically stated that she could “unequivocally say that none of the Plaintiffs is at this \npoint asking for reimbursement of any of these [previously incurred] costs and that such \nreimbursement is not part of this case.” Instead, Plaintiffs seek “the very thing to which \n[they allege they were] entitled.” Id. The EPA also points to United States Conference of \nCath. Bishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, -- F. Supp. 3d. --, No. 1:25-CV-00465 (TNM), 2025 \nWL 763738 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025). But there, the court understood the thrust of the \nplaintiff’s claim as seeking “an award of money due.” Id., 2025 WL 763738 at *5.  \n  The Fourth Circuit has recently stayed a preliminary injunction in Sustainability \nInstitute v. Trump, No. 25-1575, 2025 WL 1587100 (4th Cir. June 5, 2025), a case that is \nsimilar in a number of respects to this case.8 ECF No. 52; see 2025 WL 1587100 at *1 \n(describing the factual scenario as “the cancellation of grants that were funded generally \nby an authorizing statute but awarded specifically to each grantee by an operative grant \nagreement”). In Sustainability Institute, the Fourth Circuit motions panel concluded \n \n8 Appellees petitioned for rehearing en banc on June 10, 2025. Sustainability Institute, \nNo. 25-1575, ECF No. 43.  \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 32 of 48\nthat the government was likely to succeed in showing that the Tucker Act (rather than \nthe APA) provided jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims based in part on the Supreme \nCourt’s stay order in California. Id. at *1-2. The Fourth Circuit distinguished Bowen on \nthe ground that Bowen’s holding does not applies to cases seeking “to enforce a \ncontractual obligation to pay money.” Id. at *2 (quoting California, 145 S. Ct. at 968).    \n  But, applying Bowen, and the other decisions cited above that were rendered on \nthe merits (as opposed to in the context of a motion to stay, see Merrill, 142 S. Ct. at \n879), this Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to the APA’s waiver of \nsovereign immunity. Plaintiffs’ claims are not contractual in nature and Plaintiffs do not \nseek money damages. This Court has jurisdiction under the APA to adjudicate the \nclaims.9 \nB. Reviewability \nEPA’s terminations of Plaintiffs’ block grants are reviewable under the APA and \ndoes not run afoul of the APA’s inapplicability to “agency action[s]” that are “committed \nto agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). EPA argues that this Court lacks \njurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) because EPA’s decision to terminate these grants \nwas a “quintessential decision[] committed to agency discretion by law.” ECF No. 22 at \n \n9 Plaintiffs also argue that the Court of Federal Claims lacks subject matter jurisdiction \nover this case because the Thriving Communities grants, and the Cooperative \nAgreements, are not “contracts” within the meaning of the Tucker Act because they lack \nconsideration. ECF No. 48 at 11-13 (relying on Am. Near E. Refugee Aid v. U.S. Agency \nfor Int’l Dev., 703 F. Supp. 3d 126, 132 (D.D.C. 2023); San Antonio Hous. Auth. v. \nUnited States, 143 Fed. Cl. 425, 463 (2019); and Trauma Serv. Grp. v. United States, \n104 F.3d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). This Court need not reach that question; \nregardless of whether the grants and associated agreements are “contracts,” the Tucker \nAct does not apply for the reasons explained above.  \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 33 of 48\n25. EPA primarily cites Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993), in support of its contention \nto argue that it has discretion in determining how to allocate resources from a lump-\nsum appropriation. Id. But in Lincoln, Congress never expressly appropriated funds for \nthe centers at issue, and there was “no meaningful standard,” statutory or otherwise, \n“against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.” Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191. In \ncontrast, here, EPA terminated grants that were awarded using statutorily-appropriated \nfunds under the Clean Air Act. “Congress has circumscribed agency discretion to \nallocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative statute,” Shawnee Tribe v. \nMnuchin, 984 F.3d 94, 100 (D.C. Cir. 2021), and thus EPA’s actions are reviewable. See \nalso Climate United Fund, 2025 WL 1131412, at *13 (holding that EPA’s actions there \nwere reviewable because Congress “appropriated money for specific grant programs by a \nspecific deadline and set specific, substantive priorities”). \nIV.  DISCUSSION \nHaving concluded that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction to decide \nwhether EPA violated the APA in terminating the grants at issue, the Court now turns to \nthe merits. Plaintiffs contend that the terminations are arbitrary and capricious (Count \n1); exceed EPA’s statutory authority (Count 2); violate the First Amendment (Counts 3, \n4); and conflict with grant-termination regulations (Count 5). \nA.  The basis for EPA’s decision to terminate these grants \nAssessing whether EPA’s decision to terminate these grants was “reasonable and \nreasonably explained,” Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. at 292—including whether EPA \n“reasonably considered the relevant issues,” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. \n414, 423 (2021), and “provide[d] a reasoned explanation for the change” from its prior \npolicy and whether it “consider[ed] serious reliance interests,” Food and Drug Admin. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 34 of 48\nv. Wages & White Lion Investments, LLC, 145 S. Ct. 898, 917 (2025), as well as whether \nEPA exceeded its statutory authority under § 7438 of the Clean Air Act, see 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)—requires first identifying the basis for EPA’s agency action.10 \nAs noted above, the EPA’s termination letters articulate the basis for the \ntermination as this: “[T]he award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency \npriorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding \npriorities.” ECF No. 36-1 at 586, 903, 1084. The letters then contain two paragraphs \nfrom the template form letter described above. Much of that language is untethered to \nEPA’s termination of these grants. For example, they refer to “ensuring” that EPA \nprograms “do not support programs or organizations that promote or take part in \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) initiatives.” Id. \nAs noted above, at the same time EPA was deciding to terminate Plaintiffs’ \ngrants, EPA was also deciding to terminate other grants. And as to some of those other \ngrants, EPA’s stated “rationale” included a reference to “DEI EO issues” as a “rationale” \nfor a termination. See, e.g., id. at 149 (referring to a grant to the Institute For \nSustainable Communities). But those references were not the basis for the termination \nof Plaintiffs’ grants. They appear in Plaintiffs’ letters only because the only changeable \nfield in the template termination letters were the grant recipient’s name, grant number, \nand the contact information for the pertinent EPA official. Id. at 172–73. As reflected in \nEPA’s spreadsheets, the only basis that EPA identified as a reason to terminate \n \n10 There is no dispute that the grant terminations at issue here are final agency actions.  \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 35 of 48\nPlaintiffs’ grants was that supporting “Environmental Justice Subawards” was “not in \nline with administration priorities.” Id. at 148–49.11  \nTo the extent that basis appeared in the termination memoranda that EPA sent to \nPlaintiffs, it is limited to the bolded portion of the memoranda: \nIt is a priority of the EPA to eliminate discrimination in all \nprograms  throughout  the  United  States.  The  EPA \nAdministrator  has  determined  that,  per  the  Agency’s \nobligations  to  the  constitutional  and  statutory  law  of  the \nUnited States, this priority includes ensuring that the \nAgency’s  grants  do  not  support  programs  or \norganizations that promote or take part in diversity, equity, \nand inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives, “environmental justice” \ninitiatives,  and  conflict  with  the  Agency’s  policy  of \nprioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in performing our \nstatutory functions. In addition to complying with the civil \nrights laws, it is vital that the Agency assess whether all grant \npayments are free from fraud, abuse, waste, and duplication, \n \n11 Defendants argued at the May 30, 2025 hearing that “waste” was also a consideration \nin terminating Plaintiffs’ grants. Just as “DEI” was identified as a “Rationale” for \nterminating other grants, so was “waste.” See, e.g., ECF 36-1 at 586, 903, 1084. But \n“waste” appears nowhere in the “Rationale” for terminating the grants at issue in this \ncase. That makes sense, because, as discussed below, EPA is required to spend the funds \nthat Congress appropriated in § 7438, and to do so on specified types of projects, and to \nspecifically ensure that such projects benefit disadvantaged communities. Insofar as, by \ndeeming these grants “waste,” EPA is lodging a post-hoc rationale for these \nterminations, it fails for two reasons. First, an agency may not rely on post-hoc \nrationales to defend agency actions challenged under the APA. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. \nv. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 20 (2020) (“It is ‘a foundational principle of \nadministrative law’ that judicial review of agency action is limited to ‘the grounds that \nthe agency invoked when it took the action.’”). Second, to the extent the label “waste” is \na way of contending that EPA could terminate these grants as a way to save the federal \ngovernment money, that would be irreconcilable with the plain language of § 7438. \nCongress mandated that the funds appropriated in § 7438 be spent; the only (lawful) \nway to avoid expending the funds Congress appropriated in § 7438 would be for \nCongress to further amend the Clean Air Act.  \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 36 of 48\nas well as to assess whether current grants are in the best \ninterests of the United States. \nThe  grant  specified  above  provides  funding  for \nprograms that promote or take part in DEI initiatives or \nenvironmental justice initiatives or other initiatives that \nconflict with the Agency’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in performing our statutory functions; that are \nnot free from fraud, abuse, waste, or duplication; or that \notherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States. \nThe  grant  is  therefore  inconsistent  with,  and  no  longer \neffectuates, Agency priorities. \nId. at 586, 903, 1084.  \nIn other words, the language of the termination memoranda must be understood \nin the context of the administrative record as a whole. And in that context, the \nadministrative record reflects that (1) the entire articulated basis for terminating \nPlaintiffs’ grants was that supporting any programs under section 7438 of the Clean Air \nAct is not an “administration priority,” see, e.g., id. at 148–49 (“Program not in line with \nadministration priorities: 66.615 - Environmental Justice Subawards.”), and (2) EPA’s \nentire deliberative process reflected in the administrative record are a few email threads \namong a few EPA employees between February 11 and February 20, 2025.  \nThus, the questions presented by Plaintiffs’ claims are whether EPA exceeded its \nstatutory authority when it terminated these grants based on an objection to \n“environmental justice,” whether EPA engaged in a reasoned decision-making process \nas required by the APA, and whether the terminations violated the First or Fifth \nAmendments or OMB regulations. As explained below, Plaintiffs have established that \nthe EPA’s terminations exceed EPA’s statutory authority and are arbitrary and \ncapricious, requiring that the terminations be set aside. The Court need not and does \nnot reach Plaintiffs’ other claims. See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 472 (1994) \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 37 of 48\n(explaining that courts should generally “avoid deciding constitutional questions \npresented unless essential to proper disposition of a case”) (quoting Harmon v. \nBrucker, 355 U.S. 579, 581 (1958)). \nB.  Agency Action in Excess of Statutory Authority \nThe APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside final agency actions that \nare “not in accordance with the law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Plaintiffs allege, in Count 2 of their complaint, that EPA \nexceeded the authority Congress delegated to it in § 7438 of the Clean Air Act. Plaintiffs \nargue that by terminating the grants to Plaintiffs, who had been selected to administer \nthe § 7438 program, “EPA has effectively dismantled the Thriving Communities \nGrantmaking Program in its entirety, an action in direct contravention of its statutory \nmandate to use appropriated funds to support environmental protection activities in \ndisadvantaged communities.” ECF No. 41-1 at 30. EPA argues that it did not exceed its \nstatutory authority because § 7438 delegates authority to the EPA to define \n“disadvantaged communities,” and the EPA is not constrained to appropriate funds to \nany specific recipient. ECF No. 44-1 at 26.  \n“Courts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency \nhas acted within its statutory authority, as the APA requires.” Loper Bright Enters. v. \nRaimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 412 (2024); 5 U.S.C. § 706 (courts must “decide all relevant \nquestions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the \nmeaning . . . of the terms of an agency action”). See, e.g., Northwest Environmental \nAdvocates v. U.S. E.P.A., 537 F.3d 1006, 1019-1027 (9th Cir. 2008) (holding that the \nEPA acted in excess of the Clean Water Act in promulgating a regulation that ran \ncounter to the statute’s requirements); Iowa League of Cities v. E.P.A., 711 F.3d 844, \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 38 of 48\n876-78 (8th Cir. 2013) (same). And courts may not “defer to a merely convenient \nlitigation position or post hoc rationalization advanced to defend past agency action \nagainst attack.” Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 579 (2019). \nSection 7438 is titled “Environmental and climate justice block grants,” and it \nimposes mandatory duties on EPA. Congress directed that EPA “shall use” the \nappropriated “[e]nvironmental and climate justice block grants” ($3 billion, over the \nyears 2022 through 2027) to carry out designated “eligible activities,” defined as: \n(A)  community-led  air  and  other  pollution  monitoring, \nprevention, and remediation, and investments in low- \nand  zero-emission  and  resilient  technologies  and \nrelated infrastructure and workforce development that \nhelp reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air \npollutants; \n(B)  mitigating climate and health risks from urban heat \nislands,  extreme  heat,  wood  heater  emissions,  and \nwildfire events; \n(C)  climate resiliency and adaptation; \n(D)  reducing indoor toxics and indoor air pollution; or \n(E)  facilitating engagement of disadvantaged communities \nin  State  and  Federal  advisory  groups,  workshops, \nrulemakings, and other public processes. \nId. § 7438(b)(2). Congress further directed EPA, in “carry[ing] out” those \n“[e]nvironmental and climate justice” activities, to ensure that the programs “benefit \ndisadvantaged communities, as defined by [EPA].” Id. § 7438(b)(1).  \nWhen EPA terminated the grants at issue, it exceeded its statutory authority \nunder § 7438 because it cancelled these grants precisely because they are \n“environmental justice” programs. The termination letter specifically states that the \nreasons the grants were being terminated was because they “provide[] funding for \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 39 of 48\nprograms that promote or take part in . . . environmental justice initiatives.” ECF No. 2-\n9 at 2. As discussed above, that is the sole basis for the terminations, as confirmed in the \n“Rationale” column of the spreadsheet created by the team responsible for terminating \nthe grants. ECF No. 36-1 at 148–49. But “[e]nvironmental and climate justice” is \nprecisely what Congress required EPA to support with the § 7438 funds. EPA surely has \ndiscretion under § 7438, for example, to define what constitutes a “disadvantaged \ncommunity.” 42 U.S.C. § 7438(b)(1). What it does not have discretion to do is to “decline \nto follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections.” In re \nAiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259. Yet that is precisely what EPA has done here.  \nThe violation of statutory authority is especially clear here, because the stated \nbasis for terminating these grants is entirely incompatible with the statutory mandate, \nas confirmed repeatedly in the administrative record. The record contains several emails \nabout terminating the Thriving Communities Grant Program in its entirety because of \nits connection to environmental justice. Some examples: \n•  “One flag I have is the first few large ones are the EJ Thriving \nCommunities Technical Assistance Centers (TCTACs) . . . There were 18 in \ntotal established, so a number of them are missed here. Not sure why they \ndidn’t all get captured (they may not have all gone out yet), but I would \nwant to apply a broad approach and cancel them all in the vein the entire \nprogram is inconsistent with Administration priorities and I personally \ndo not see the need for these because at the state-level, EPA and the \nTCTAC grantees refused to engage with the state in any kind of \ncoordination. This should result in a larger $$ amount. I can flag for OMS \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 40 of 48\nseparately too that we want the cancellation to extend to every TCTAC \ngrantee.” ECF No. 36-1 at 149 (emphasis added). \n•  “Sorry – I missed these additional 4 TCTAC ones you had flagged that \nshould have been included. Not sure this gets us up to the 18 total still.” Id. \nat 148 (listing the grants for Plaintiffs as being cancelled because the \nprograms are not in line with administration priorities, and Plaintiffs’ \ngrants seem to be flagged because they have the words “environmental \njustice” in the grant name). \n•  “We will get moving on these, plus all the TCTACs!” Id. \nThe above correspondence makes clear that, in terminating the grants at issue in \nthis case, EPA’s intention was the removal of a grant program in its entirety that was \ncongressionally mandated under the Clean Air Act.  \nThe incompatibility of EPA’s termination of these grants on the sole basis of \nopposition to “environmental justice,” on one hand, and Congress’s mandate that EPA \nspend the appropriated funds on specific “[e]nvironmental and climate justice” \npriorities (such as pollution monitoring, etc.), on the other hand, only became clearer as \nthis litigation proceeded. At the final hearing, EPA went so far as to contend that it has \nauthority to not spend any of the funds that Congress appropriated in § 7438.  \nSpecifically, EPA argued that “the congressional mandate was to award the grants, \nperiod, full stop,” and that “there was not a mandate that all of the money must be \nspent.” In other words, EPA contends that it has authority to thumb its nose at Congress \nand refuse to comply with its directives. That constitutes a clear example of an agency \nacting “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright,” and thereby violating the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(C)(2).  \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 41 of 48\nThis is not to say, of course, that the Clean Air Act requires that EPA specifically \nfund Plaintiffs (or any other particular grantee), as Plaintiffs acknowledge. See ECF No. \n48 at 24. But the Clean Air Act does require that the grant program exist and that these \ngrants support “environmental justice” in some way, as defined by the EPA. And it does \nprohibit precisely what EPA did here: expressly terminating grants because they are for \nprograms that Congress mandated EPA to fund. In other words, Congress expressly \nrequired EPA to use the appropriated funds for “environmental justice” programs. By \nterminating Plaintiffs’ grants on the basis that current EPA leadership no longer wants \nto support “environmental justice” programs, EPA exceeded its authority under the \nClean Air Act, and therefore was “in excess of statutory . . . authority, or limitations,” in \nviolation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nC. Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \nIn addition to authorizing courts to “police the outer statutory boundaries” of \nCongress’s delegations of authority, Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 374, the APA requires \ncourts to hold unlawful and set aside final agency actions that are “arbitrary, capricious, \nan abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nAn agency action is “arbitrary and capricious” if it is not both “reasonable and \nreasonably explained.” Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. at 292. An agency must “act[] within a \nzone of reasonableness” and “reasonably consider[] the relevant issues and reasonably \nexplained the decision.” Prometheus Radio, 592 U.S. at 423. “Generally, an agency \ndecision is arbitrary and capricious if ‘the agency has relied on factors which Congress \nhas not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before \nthe agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 42 of 48\nthe product of agency expertise.’” Sierra Club v. United States Dep’t of the Interior, 899 \nF.3d 260, 293 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). An agency must “examine \nthe relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Food and Drug \nAdmin., 145 S. Ct. at 917 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).  \nDetermining whether an agency action is “reasonable and reasonably explained” \nis “measured by what [the agency] did, not by what it might have done.” SEC v. Chenery \nCorp., 318 U.S. 80, 93-94 (1943). As noted above, “judicial review of agency action is \nlimited to ‘the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action.’” Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 20 (2020) (quoting Michigan \nv. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 758 (2015)). And although “[a]gencies are free to change their \nexisting policies,” a change in policy requires an agency to “provide a reasoned \nexplanation for the change, display awareness that they are changing position, and \nconsider serious reliance interests.” Food and Drug Admin., 145 S. Ct. at 917 (cleaned \nup).  \nPlaintiffs argue that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious for several \nreasons. They argue that the ground(s) that EPA articulated in its termination \nmemoranda were vague, varied, and devoid of support, and otherwise failed to “explain \nor substantiate any of its possible grounds for termination.” ECF No. 41-1 at 25–26.  \nThey argue the administrative record “confirms that the termination memorandum was \na form document that EPA mass emailed to hundreds of grantees operating under a \nwide variety of agency programs.” ECF No. 41-1 at 26. Plaintiffs also argue that that EPA \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 43 of 48\nfailed to account for “Plaintiffs’ reliance interests.” Id. at 29 (citing Regents of the Univ. \nof Cal., 591 U.S. at 30).  \n  EPA argues, in response, that the federal acquisition regulations permit it to \nterminate grants “if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency \npriorities.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4); see ECF No. 44-1 at 32-33.12 That regulation, in \n \n12 That regulation in full provides as follows: \n(a) The  Federal  award  may  be  terminated  in  part  or  its \nentirety as follows: \n(1) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity if the \nrecipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the terms \nand conditions of the Federal award; \n(2) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity with the \nconsent of the recipient or subrecipient, in which case \nthe  two  parties  must  agree  upon  the  termination \nconditions. These conditions include the effective date \nand, in the case of partial termination, the portion to \nbe terminated; \n(3) By  the  recipient  or  subrecipient  upon  sending  the \nFederal  agency  or  pass-through  entity  a  written \nnotification of the reasons for such termination, the \neffective date, and, in the case of partial termination, \nthe portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal \nagency  or  pass-through  entity  determines  that  the \nremaining  portion  of  the  Federal  award  will  not \naccomplish the purposes for which the Federal award \nwas made, the Federal agency or pass-through entity \nmay terminate the Federal award in its entirety; or \n(4) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity pursuant \nto  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Federal  award, \nincluding, to the extent authorized by law, if an award \nno longer effectuates the program goals or agency \npriorities.  \n(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly \nand unambiguously specify all termination provisions in \nthe terms and conditions of the Federal award.  \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)-(b) (emphasis added). \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 44 of 48\nturn, is incorporated into the general terms and conditions of the grants at issue here, as \nnoted above. ECF No. 2-13 at 3-4. EPA asserts that, under Section 200.340, it may \nterminate the grants at issue here pursuant to changes in agency priorities and program \ngoals, and that therefore Plaintiffs’ argument that the terminations were arbitrary and \ncapricious are likely to fail. ECF No. 22 at 24; ECF No. 44-1 at 33. Plaintiffs respond \nthat, not only is EPA’s declaration of its new “agency priority” itself arbitrary and \ncapricious, but “an agency cannot render its actions non-arbitrary merely by invoking \nthe term ‘agency priorities.’” ECF No. 24 at 20 (citing Int’l Union, United Mine Workers \nof Am. v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 358 F.3d 40, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“The [agency’s] \nstatement that there was a ‘change in agency priorities,’ without explanation, is not \ninformative in the least[.]”). \nEPA’s terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants, in addition to exceeding statutory \nauthority and limitations as discussed above, also failed to “reasonably consider[] the \nrelevant issues” or “explain[] the decision,” Prometheus Radio, 592 U.S. at 423. The \nFebruary 2025 termination memoranda supplied no meaningful explanation for the \ntermination of the initial grants. And as discussed above, the sole actual basis for the \nterminations was that they “provide[] funding for programs that promote or take part in \n. . . environmental justice initiatives.” ECF No. 36-1 at 586, 903, 1084. But that is a \nmeaningless statement in the context of a statute that mandates expenditure of \nappropriated funds on environmental justice initiatives. For example, nowhere did EPA \ncontend that the Regional Grantmakers should hold off issuing sub-grants so that EPA \ncould issue guidance on interpreting the phrase “disadvantaged communities” under § \n7348(b)(1). Instead, to the extent EPA provided an explanation for its decision to \nterminate these grants, it was announcing a disagreement with Congress. Although that \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 45 of 48\ncould conceivably form a basis for the administration to go to Congress to request that it \nrevoke § 7438, see n. 12, supra, it does not qualify as a “satisfactory explanation” for \nterminating these grants. See Food and Drug Admin., 145 S. Ct. at 917. Put differently, \nEPA “relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider,” Sierra Club, 899 \nF.3d at 293, namely a policy disagreement with its statutory mandate. EPA is correct \nthat OMB regulations allow EPA to terminate grant awards that “no longer effectuate[] \nthe program goals or agency priorities,” but only “to the extent authorized by law.” 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). The APA does not permit agencies to act arbitrarily and \ncapriciously. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \nFurthermore, EPA has not conducted any individualized analysis for why these \ngrants or grantees conflict with the agency’s priorities. In fact, all three plaintiffs in this \ncase received nearly identical termination letters with identical reasons for their grants \nbeing terminated. Compare ECF No. 2-9 at 2-3, with ECF No. 2-28 at 2-3; ECF No. 2-18 \nat 2-3. EPA used form letters and emails to terminate not only the grants at issue in this \ncase, but a swath of other grants too. ECF No. 36-1 at 161, 172-73. The EPA’s form email \ncontains only two total changeable fields, the grant number and the grantee name. Id. at \n161. And the termination letters sent to the Plaintiffs were created from a form letter \ncirculated by the EPA officials, where the only changeable fields were relating to the \ngrant-specific identifying information. Id. at 172-73. The reasons laid out for the \nterminations were pre-written. Although using pre-written language does not, standing \nalone, render a decision arbitrary and capricious, the administrative record here clearly \nestablishes that EPA’s decision to wipe out all programs funded under § 7438 of the \nClean Air Act was not tailored to any specific plaintiff or grantee. EPA offered no \nindividualized analysis or discussion about why these grants failed to comply with the \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 46 of 48\nClean Air Act or other legal requirements, or any other basis for terminating these \ngrants. In other words, there was no “rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \nThe lack of any reasoned decision-making, or reasoned explanation, is \ncompounded by the fact that the terminations reflect a reversal of EPA’s prior policies \nunder which these grants at issue were awarded. The APA requires an agency to provide \ndetailed justification for a new policy priority “when, for example, its new policy rests \nupon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its \nprior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” \nF.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (citing Smiley v. \nCitibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996)). The EPA plainly failed to do so \nhere, and in so doing, has not shown that it took the reliance interests of the Plaintiffs \ninto account when deciding to terminate the grants at issue.  \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs have shown that the terminations were “arbitrary, \ncapricious, [and] an abuse of discretion,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), and for those additional \nreasons the APA requires that they be “set aside,” id. § 706(2).  \nV.  RELIEF \nBecause Defendants have violated the APA, then as a matter of constitutional \navoidance, the Court need not reach the remaining counts, including those asserting \nconstitutional claims. See, e.g., Bonumose, Inc. v. United States Food and Drug Admin., \n747 F. Supp. 3d 211, 232-33 (D.D.C. 2024) (denying the constitutional claims with the \ncaveat that plaintiffs may raise those arguments on remand and in any subsequent \njudicial proceeding); see also Whims v. Harbaugh, 139 F.3d 897, at *1 (4th Cir. 1998) \n(per curiam) (construing the Accardi doctrine claim as a procedural due process claim).  \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 47 of 48\nWhen an agency has violated the APA, “[t]he reviewing court shall . . . hold \nunlawful and set aside [the] agency action.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(a). Defendants ask this \nCourt to instead not vacate this action but rather remand to matter back to EPA to \ncorrect the deficiencies, while keeping the terminations in place. ECF No. 44-1 at 35. \nRemand without vacatur is a remedy that turns on two factors: “(1) the seriousness of \nthe deficiencies of the action, that is, how likely it is the agency will be able to justify its \ndecision on remand; and (2) the disruptive consequences of vacatur.” Heartland Reg’l \nMed. Ctr. v. Sebelius, 566 F.3d 193, 197 (D.C. Cir. 2009 (cleaned up)) (quoting Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc. v. FCC, 280 F.3d 1027, 1048-49 (D.C. Cir. 2002)). Defendants \nconceded in the May 30 hearing that remand without vacatur is an unusual and \ndisfavored remedy, and have not explained how EPA would be able to justify the \nterminations on remand nor how vacatur would cause disruption for the agency. \nTherefore, the Court will vacate the terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants at issue and \nremand for further agency proceedings. \nIn addition to the usual remedy of vacatur and remand, Plaintiffs further request \nthat the Court enter a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants “from terminating \nthe Plaintiffs Organizations’ Thriving Communities grants on the ground that the \nPlaintiff Organizations or their subgrantees promote or take part in ‘environmental \njustice initiatives’ or on the ground that the Thriving Communities program is itself an \n‘environmental justice initiative.’” ECF No. 41-8 at 3. In other words, Plaintiffs request \nan injunction prohibiting EPA from terminating their grants again on the exact same \nbasis that this Court now holds violated the APA. The Court declines to issue the \ninjunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs. “An injunction is a drastic and extraordinary \nremedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course. If a less drastic remedy . . . \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01096-ABA     Document 56     Filed 06/17/25     Page 48 of 48\n[is] sufficient to redress [Plaintiffs’] injury, no recourse to the additional and \nextraordinary relief of an injunction [is] warranted.” Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed \nFarms, 561 U.S. 139, 165-66 (2010) (citing Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. \n305, 311-12 (1982)). Here, vacatur has the effect of prohibiting the EPA from \nterminating Plaintiffs’ grants on the grounds at issue in this case.  \nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, EPA’s terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants were “in excess\nof statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), and “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law,” in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Accordingly, \nthe Administrative Procedures Act requires that the terminations be “set aside.” Id. ¶ \n706(2). This means Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment will be largely granted \n(and Defendants’ motion will be denied), but the Court denies Plaintiffs’ request for an \ninjunction because Plaintiffs’ requested injunction would essentially duplicate this \nCourt’s order setting aside the terminations. A separate order follows. \n/s/\nDate:  June 17, 2025  __________________ \nAdam B. Abelson \nUnited States District Judge \n48 ",
