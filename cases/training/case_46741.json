          "description": "MINUTE ORDER denying the Plaintiffs' 3 Emergency Motion to Expedite. When considering motions to expedite discovery, courts in this District generally consider the \"reasonableness of the request in light of all surrounding circumstances.\" Am. Fedn of Lab. & Cong. of Indus. Orgs. v. Dept of Lab., No. 25-cv-339, 2025 WL 1142495, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 27, 2025) (cleaned up). These circumstances include: \"(1) whether a preliminary injunction is pending; (2) the breadth of the discovery requests; (3) the purpose for requesting the expedited discovery; (4) the burden on the defendants to comply with the requests; and (5) how far in advance of the typical discovery process the request was made.\" Id. The second, third, and fourth factors all weigh in favor of the Plaintiffs. But because the first and fifth factors weigh strongly in favor of the Defendants, the Court exercises its \"discretion\" to deny the 3 motion. Id.The first factor favors the Defendants because the Plaintiffs have not sought preliminary injunctive relief. See, e.g., In re Fannie Mae Derivative Litig., 227 F.R.D. 142, 142-43 (D.D.C. 2005) (finding request for expedited discovery unreasonable where the plaintiff moved \"for expedited discovery to enable him to make a record upon which to base a motion for preliminary injunction\"). The Plaintiffs argue that their request for expedited summary judgment briefing counts as the \"functional equivalent of a preliminary injunction motion.\" ECF No. 3 at 6 (citing \"Morton v. District of Columbia, 38 F. Supp. 57, 62 (D.D.C. 2014)\"). The Court assumes the Plaintiffs intended to cite Morris v. District of Columbia, 38 F. Supp. 3d 57 (D.D.C. 2014), to support this proposition. But Morris merely states that courts treat a preliminary injunction motion as a summary judgment motion when the preliminary injunction motion \"disposes of the entire complaint.\" Id. at 63. It does not support expedited discovery in the absence of a preliminary injunction motion. The Plaintiffs also argue that \"[c]ourts have weighed the first factor in plaintiffs' favor as long as the motion was forthcoming and the purpose of expedited discovery was to facilitate resolution of the coming motion.\" ECF No. 3 at 6 (citing Legal Tech. Grp., Inc. v. Mukerji, No. 17-cv-631, 2017 WL 7279398, at *3 (D.D.C. June 5, 2017); Am. Fedn of Lab. & Cong. of Indus. Orgs., 2025 WL 1142495). But the Plaintiffs have not indicated that a preliminary injunction motion is forthcoming. And in one of the cases it cites, the plaintiffs had already filed a TRO motion. See Am. Fedn of Lab. & Cong. of Indus. Orgs., 2025 WL 1142495, at *3 (\"[P]laintiffs' two TRO motions have revealed the factual and legal issues critical to the impending preliminary injunction motion.\"). So this argument is not on point either.The fifth factor also favors the Defendants because the Plaintiffs seek discovery so far in advance of the typical discovery process that the Defendants have not yet filed their anticipated motion to dismiss. See Guttenberg v. Emery, 26 F. Supp. 3d 88, 99 (D.D.C. 2014) (saying request for expedited discovery came \"well in advance of typical discovery\" where it was filed while a motion to dismiss was pending (cleaned up)); Landwehr v. FDIC, 282 F.R.D. 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2010) (same); see also ECF No. 6 at 2 (\"Defendants intend to file a motion to dismiss[.]\"). The Plaintiffs cite two cases to counter this conclusion. See ECF No. 3 at 8 (citing All. for Retired Ams. v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-313, 2025 WL 1114350, at *3-4 (D.D.C. Mar. 20, 2025); New Mexico v. Musk, 770 F. Supp. 3d 192, 196-97, 203 (D.D.C. 2025)). But the first case held that this factor was \"ambivalent\" despite the fact that the expedited discovery motion preceded any motion to dismiss only because the court had already \"resolved threshold arguments about its subject-matter jurisdiction that arose during the [c]ourt's consideration of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\" All. for Retired Ams., 2025 WL 1114350, at *4. And in the second case, \"[t]he parties concede[d] that the fifth factor--whether discovery occurs in advance of the typical process--support[ed] Defendants.\" New Mexico, 770 F. Supp. 3d at 203.The Plaintiffs are free to seek emergency relief from the Court at any time. Signed by Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan on 6/28/2025. (lcas)"

          "description": "MINUTE ORDER: On September 29, 2025, the Plaintiffs filed a 53 Motion to Suspend Lapse Date for Fourteen Days. The Plaintiffs ask the Court to \"order that the September 30th lapse date for the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriation for the Fair Housing Initiatives Program ('FHIP') be suspended for fourteen days.\" ECF No. 53, at 1. The Plaintiffs suggest that this relief is necessary to preserve their ability to assert challenges to award determinations. Id. at 3-4. To begin, it is unclear whether the Plaintiffs' Motion constitutes a motion to modify the Court's 33 Order granting a preliminary injunction, or whether the Motion itself seeks a new temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. Either way, the Plaintiffs do not meet their burden to show they are entitled to relief. See, e.g., Open Top Sightseeing USA v. Mr. Sightseeing, LLC, 48 F. Supp. 3d 87, 90 (D.D.C. 2014) (plaintiffs have the burden to establish entitlement to preliminary injunctive relief); Nguyen v. DHS, 460 F. Supp. 3d 27, 33 (D.D.C. 2020) (same for temporary restraining orders). The Plaintiffs' claims in this case were based on the Defendants' alleged refusal to issue Private Enforcement Initiative (\"PEI\") grants and to award new FHIP grants. See Compl. ¶¶ 117-46, ECF No. 1. They sought an order requiring the Defendants \"[e]nsure all outstanding FY2024 FHIP funds are obligated before September 30,\" implement ongoing PEI awards, and \"[i]ssue awards and finalize contracts for the FY2024 NOFOs.\" Compl. at 34. After issuing an 25 Order granting a temporary restraining order, the Court issued an 33 Order granting a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction ordered the Defendants \"to comply with their statutory obligations to make funds available under the Fair Housing Initiatives Program . . . before the appropriations lapse on September 30, 2025.\" ECF No. 33, at 1. Today, September 30, 2025, the Defendants filed a 55 Notice stating that \"all FY24 FHIP funds have been obligated.\" The Plaintiffs have not disputed that representation. At this point, it appears the Plaintiffs have received the relief they requested in their Complaint. And it appears that the Defendants have complied with the Court's preliminary injunction. Before yesterday, the Plaintiffs never indicated that they were asking the Court to suspend the lapse date for the Fiscal Year 2024 FHIP funds to facilitate potential challenges to award determinations. Nor do the Plaintiffs articulate any alleged violation of law by the Defendants that could justify the Court exercising its \"equitable authority\" to suspend the lapse date. See ECF No. 53, at 3. Even assuming that this Court can \"order that funds be held available beyond their statutory lapse date if equity so requires,\" Nat'l Ass'n of Reg'l Councils v. Costle, 564 F.2d 583, 588 (D.C. Cir. 1977), the Plaintiffs have not established that equity requires that relief here. The most that the Plaintiffs have to say is that this relief is \"appropriate\" because \"HUD shifted back its timeline for awards without notice.\" ECF No. 53, at 5. The Parties appear to agree, however, that any Plaintiffs whose applications might have been denied because of scoring errors can receive money from sources other than the Fiscal Year 2024 funds. ECF No. 53, at 2; ECF No. 56, at 5. So, the Plaintiff's concerns now seem to be focused on potential \"challenges to award determinations that do not relate to scoring or eligibility.\" ECF No. 57, at 1-2. But the Plaintiffs admit that they are not aware of a basis for any such challenge, nor do they explain what such a challenge would look like. See id. at 1. At bottom, although the Court understands that the Plaintiffs would prefer to have the opportunity to challenge award determinations before passage of the lapse date, that was not the basis of their claims in this case, and they do not identify anything that gives them the right to do so. Accordingly, the Court denies the Plaintiffs' 53 Motion. Signed by Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan on 9/30/2025. (lcdl)"

Under the Trump Administration, the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) began to refuse to implement the second and third years of existing multi-year FHIP awards nor award new grants from pending application cycles.</p>\r\n<p>On June 24, 2025, the National Fair Housing Alliance and the Tennessee Fair Housing Council filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the HUD and its Secretary to challenge the withholding of FHIP grant money. This case was assigned to Judge Sparkle L. Sooknann. The plaintiffs sought to certify a class consisting of all other fair housing organizations who received multi-year Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI) awards in 2023 or 2024 but who have been unable to negotiate their second or third years with HUD.</p>\r\n<p>The following claims were brought in the complaint:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>HUD's refusal to administer FHIP grants violates the mandatory language in the FHIP provisions of the FHA and the FY2024 Appropriations Act. This would mean that the grant money is being unlawfully withheld under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).</li>\r\n<li>HUD's refusal to administer FHIP grants violates the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. It is also arbitrary and capricious under the APA.</li>\r\n<li>HUD exceeds the Executive Branch's constitutional authority and encroaches on the legislature's powers.</li>\r\n<li>The PEI plaintiffs claimed a separate violation of their due process rights.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought class certification, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked that the court declare the refusal to administer FHIP grants unlawful and to order HUD to ensure all funds are dispersed.</p>\r\n<p>On June 24, the plaintiffs moved to expedite the production of the administrative record and limited discovery for an upcoming summary judgement motion. This motion was submitted due to urgent need for FY2024 funds to be administered before the plaintiff organizations were forced to cease operations. This motion was denied on June 28, 2025. The court encouraged the plaintiffs to seek another form of emergency relief instead.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs then moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on July 24, 2025. &nbsp;The court granted a TRO regarding the claims concerning new grants. In regards to the claims concerning multi-year grants, the court claimed that it believed \"relief is warranted but will reserve judgements given the Plaintiffs' request that it [delay] resolution of these claims until later this week.\"</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Case No. 1:25-cv-01965 \n   \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nURBAN DEVELOPMENT,    \n451 7th St. SW \nWashington, DC 20410, and \n \nSCOTT TURNER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, \n451 7th St. SW \nWashington, DC 20410, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This case concerns the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s \n(“HUD” or “Defendant”) refusal to abide by the Constitution and laws duly enacted by Congress \nand to spend funds that Congress has appropriated. HUD is flouting its obligation to administer a \nfair housing grant program established and funded by Congress. This abdication of duty will \ninflict devastating harm on Plaintiffs, who are non-profit organizations that rely on their grant \nrelationships with HUD to provide essential housing services within their communities. Those \ncommunities, in turn, will be left with no effective enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, 42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 2 of 34\nU.S.C. 3601, et seq., which prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, national origin, \nsex, disability, religion, and familial status.  \n2.  Congress amended the Fair Housing Act (“FHA” or “the Act”) in 1992 to \nestablish the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (“FHIP”), which provides grants to certain private, \nnonprofit fair housing organizations—like Plaintiffs here—to facilitate enforcement of the Act. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 3616a. For more than three decades, Congress has annually appropriated funds \nfor FHIP. \n3.  FHIP funding is essential to preventing and remedying housing discrimination. \nCongress created FHIP with the express goal of filling a gap in enforcement of the Fair Housing \nAct, and the federal government has repeatedly recognized that fair housing organizations funded \nby FHIP do just that: they facilitate meritorious claims, collect critical evidence of \ndiscrimination, and provide much-needed services to housing consumers. Congress and HUD \nrely on fair housing organizations for their work, and fair housing organizations rely on Congress \nand HUD for funding.  \n4.  Despite more than thirty years of unbroken interdependence between the federal \ngovernment and fair housing organizations, HUD is now ignoring its FHIP mandate by refusing \nto spend appropriated funds. HUD is neither administering existing grants nor awarding new \ngrants from pending application cycles. Specifically, HUD is refusing to implement the second \nand third years of existing multi-year awards and refusing to make additional grant awards under \nthe FY2024 funding cycle. \n5.  Federal agencies are generally required to spend funds appropriated by Congress \nfor specific purposes. And here, the plain text of the FHA additionally requires HUD to award \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 3 of 34\nand administer FHIP grants whenever Congress appropriates funds for that purpose, as it has \ndone every year since establishing FHIP. See 42 U.S.C. § 3616a. \n6.  Consistent with Congressional appropriations legislation, the FHA, and applicable \nregulations, HUD announced the award of dozens of multi-year Private Enforcement Initiative \n(“PEI”) grants in both 2023 and 2024. These PEI grants are three-year FHIP awards for bread-\nand-butter fair housing enforcement activities. These multi-year grants recognize the important \nreliance interest FHIP grant recipients have in receiving consistent, year-over-year funding to \nhire staff, enter into leases, undertake complex investigations and litigation, and otherwise \nengage in ongoing activities that do not end after a single grant year. \n7.  The periods of performance for these ongoing PEI grants run into calendar years \n2026 and 2027. Ordinarily, prior to a grant year expiring, HUD works with grantees to finalize \nthe agency forms reflecting the agreed-upon activities, deliverables, and payment schedules for \nthe second and third years of these grants. Finalized agreements are necessary to ensure that PEI \nrecipients will receive payment for work performed under their grants. Since April 2025, HUD \nhas refused to facilitate multi-year grants. Because the first years of these grants have begun to \nexpire, HUD’s refusal to facilitate the second and third years is creating gaps in funding. \n8.  In addition to these ongoing PEI grants, HUD issued Notices of Funding \nOpportunity (“NOFOs”) for new FHIP awards in September 2024. These NOFOs solicited \napplications for three types of grants, all of which are required by the Act whenever Congress \nappropriates FHIP funding: further multi-year PEI awards (largely to replace those that are \nexpiring this year), Fair Housing Organization Initiative (“FHOI”) awards, and Education and \nOutreach Initiative (“EOI”) awards (collectively “the FY2024 NOFOs”). Applications for these \nawards were submitted by the end of November 2024. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 4 of 34\n9.  In the ordinary course, HUD would have immediately started a review and \nselection process, with recipients announced in early 2025. To date, HUD has not awarded any \nnew FHIP grants from the FY2024 NOFOs.  \n10.  Both the continued funding for existing PEI grants and the additional awards \ncontemplated by the FY2024 NOFOs are funded through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \n2024, Pub. L. 118–42 (hereinafter “FY2024 Appropriations Act”).  \n11.  Any funds from this appropriation that are not obligated by September 30, 2025 \nwill lapse and cease to be available. HUD’s refusal to implement existing PEI grants and to \nadminister the FY2024 NOFOs risks the complete loss of the appropriated funds. This loss of \nfunding will harm Plaintiffs, NFHA members, and members of the class. Many affected \norganizations will be forced to curtail or cease operations, which will harm the individuals who \nrely on the services of privates fair housing organizations to access housing—senior citizens, \ndisabled veterans, people with disabilities, voucher recipients, survivors of domestic violence, \nand other home seekers.  \n12.  Plaintiffs are the National Fair Housing Alliance (“NFHA”), on behalf of itself \nand a class of fair housing organizations with at least one full year left on active PEI grants that \nhave been unable to negotiate years two and three with HUD (“Active PEI Class”), and the \nTennessee Fair Housing Council (“TFHC”). Both NFHA and TFHC applied for FHIP awards \nunder the as-of-yet unresolved FY2024 NOFOs. \n13.  HUD made the decision not to continue its ordinary and planned expenditures of \nappropriated FHIP funds more than two months ago, and HUD has implemented this decision in \nthe intervening months by withholding FHIP funding, yet the Administration has not made a \nrequest to Congress to rescind the FY2024 FHIP appropriation. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 5 of 34\n14.  HUD’s decision to impound appropriated FHIP funds rather than expend them \nviolates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the U.S. Constitution. HUD’s refusal to \nadminister FHIP awards is an agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed in \nviolation of the APA because it contravenes the FHA, the FY2024 Appropriations Act, and \napplicable regulations. HUD’s impoundment decision also violates the APA because it is an \nagency action that is arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law. HUD’s \nrefusal to administer FHIP awards also violates separation of powers and the Appropriations \nClause of the Constitution. Finally, HUD’s refusal to implement existing PEI grants amounts to \ngrant termination, yet HUD has not provided any notice or process to grant recipients in violation \nof the Due Process Clause.   \n15.  Plaintiffs seek to compel HUD to abide by the law and to administer FHIP grants, \nincluding prospective injunctive relief ordering HUD to (1) administer existing PEI grants by \nimplementing years two and three for the Active PEI Class; and (2) award and obligate \noutstanding FY2024 appropriations pursuant to the FY2024 NOFOs.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  Plaintiffs bring this action under the U.S. Constitution and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ \n551 et seq. \n17.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, and 1361.  \n18.  Venue is proper in this district because Defendants reside in, and a substantial part \nof the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in, this judicial district. 28 U.S.C.  \n§ 1391(e). \n19.  The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and injunctive relief \nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 6 of 34\nPARTIES \n20.  Plaintiff National Fair Housing Alliance, Inc., is a national, nonprofit public \nservice membership organization incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia \nwith its principal place of business in Washington, D.C. NFHA was established in 1988 and has \nreceived and relied on FHIP grants since 1990. NFHA’s mission is to end housing segregation \nand ensure equal housing opportunities for all people and communities through its housing and \ncommunity development, education and outreach, responsible AI, member services, public \npolicy and advocacy, consulting and compliance, and enforcement initiatives.  \n21.  NFHA represents approximately 170 private, nonprofit member organizations \nthroughout the country, many of whom are eligible for FHIP funding, and 80 individual \nmembers. NFHA is the only national organization dedicated solely to ending housing \ndiscrimination and promoting residential integration. Many of the non-profit fair housing \norganizations that are NFHA members rely on FHIP funding for their day-to-day activities \nenforcing the FHA, and these members are harmed by HUD’s failure to administer FHIP awards.  \n22.  NFHA has relied on FHIP grants for decades. Throughout that time, NFHA has \nconsistently met or exceeded its goals for deliverables on its FHIP grants. NFHA received an \nexcellent rating from HUD on its most recent performance assessment report for the first year of \nits active PEI award. NFHA timely applied for EOI and FHOI grants pursuant to the FY2024 \nNOFOs issued by HUD. NFHA meets all the eligibility requirements for the proposed award and \nsubmitted all requisite materials in support of its application. \n23.  Plaintiff Tennessee Fair Housing Council is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization \nbased in Nashville, Tennessee. TFHC was established in 1995 and has received and relied on \nFHIP grants throughout its history, including for the last six years. Since 1995, TFHC has been \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 7 of 34\nawarded 15 FHIP grants. Throughout that time, TFHC has consistently met or exceeded its goals \nfor deliverables on its FHIP grants. TFHC received an excellent rating from HUD on its most \nrecent performance assessment report for the second year of its previous PEI award.  \n24.  TFHC’s previous multi-year PEI award expired on May 31, 2025. TFHC timely \napplied for a new PEI grant pursuant to the FY2024 NOFOs issued by HUD. TFHC meets all the \neligibility requirements for the proposed award and submitted all requisite materials in support of \nits application. \n24.  Defendant U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) is an \nexecutive branch agency of the United States government. It is charged with administering a \nvariety of federal housing programs, including the Fair Housing Initiative Program grants at \nissue in this Complaint. \n25.  Defendant Scott Turner is sued in his official capacity as the Secretary of HUD. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nCongress’s Establishment of FHIP  \n25.  Since the FHA was passed in 1968, non-profit organizations devoted to fair \nhousing have played a pivotal role in making the statute’s protections real. Throughout the \ncountry, these fair housing groups help individuals and families avoid homelessness, stave off \nevictions, find safe places to live, ensure that their homes are accessible, and seek redress for \ndiscrimination. In addition, fair housing organizations are uniquely situated to root out and \nredress systemic discrimination through testing and other investigative tools.  \n26.  During the 1970s and 1980s, fair housing organizations endeavored to advance \nthe principles and goals of the FHA with minimal resources. The House Report on the Fair \nHousing Amendments Act of 1988 noted that “fair housing organizations are burdened with \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 8 of 34\nprimary enforcement responsibility” for the FHA, H.R. Rep. No. 711, 100th Cong., 2d Sess.  \n15–16, reprinted in 1988 U.S. Code Cong. Admin. News 2173, 2176–77 (footnotes omitted), but \nthey lacked sufficient resources to carry this burden.  \n27.  Beginning in 1987, fair housing groups worked with HUD to develop a program \nthat would provide direct funding to qualified, private, nonprofit fair housing organizations to \nconduct fair housing education programs and to provide intake, testing, investigation, \nconciliation, and/or litigation of verified complaints of housing discrimination to increase the \neffectiveness of the FHA. With support from the Reagan administration and leadership from the \nHouse and Senate, Congress approved a $3 million pilot program called the Fair Housing \nInitiatives Program (FHIP) in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. The initial \ntwo-year program was extended for two more years in 1990. \n28.  Recognizing “the proven efficacy of” fair housing organizations that were serving \nas “a necessary component of the fair housing enforcement system,” Pub. L. 102–550,  \n§ 905(a)(9), Congress amended the FHA to provide sustainable support for these organizations. \nIt did so through the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, which made FHIP \npermanent and authorized FHIP funds to implement testing programs; establish new fair housing \norganizations or expand capacity of existing ones; conduct special projects to respond to new or \nsophisticated forms of housing discrimination; undertake larger, long-term enforcement activities \nthrough multi-year funding agreements; and bring enforcement actions to ensure compliance \nwith the FHA. See 42 U.S.C. § 3616a. \n29.  Since the 1992 amendment of the FHA, fair housing groups have continued to be \ncritical to enforcing fair housing laws. The U.S. Government Accountability Office noted the \neffectiveness of the fair housing organization model in a comprehensive analysis of FHIP in \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 9 of 34\n1997,1 and in 2011, a HUD study concluded that FHIP grantees add enormous value to the \nagency:  \nWhen FHIP grantee organizations are the first point of contact for a complainant, \nthe organization adds value in two ways: First, FHIP grantee organizations weed \nout cases that are not covered by civil rights statutes, as well as those cases in \nwhich the organization’s investigations show a complaint lacks merit. This vetting \nsaves resources for HUD and state agencies that do not have to investigate these \ncases. Second, the investigative evidence provided to HUD and state agencies for \na complaint on which a FHIP grantee organization has signed on as a complainant \nor representative adds merit to those cases. These are the cases that are much \nmore likely to end in a conciliation or cause finding than are other cases in which \nthe complainant comes directly to HUD and state agencies. Of particularly high \nvalue is testing evidence, which is limited almost exclusively to the cases that \ninvolve a FHIP grantee organization.2 \n \n26.  To the extent Congress has appropriated funds, the FHA requires HUD to provide \nthree categories of funding: PEI grants, FHOI grants, and EOI grants. See generally 42 U.S.C. \n3616a. The purpose of these grants is to fund “programs or activities designed to obtain \nenforcement of the rights granted by” the FHA. Id. \n27.  For PEI grants, the FHA provides that “[t]he Secretary shall use funds made \navailable under this subsection to conduct, through contracts with private nonprofit fair housing \nenforcement organizations, investigations of violations of the rights granted under [the FHA], \nand such enforcement activities as appropriate to remedy such violations.” 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 3616a(b)(1) (emphasis added). The Secretary shall use funds “to conduct, through contracts \nwith private nonprofit fair housing enforcement organizations, a range of investigation and \n \n1 Gov’t Accounting Office, Letter Report, March 3, 1997, Fair Housing: Funding and Activities \nUnder the Fair Housing Initiatives Program, available at \nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-RCED-97-67/html/GAOREPORTS-\nRCED-97-67.htm. \n2 U.S. Dep’t of Hous. and Urban Dev., Office of Policy Dev. and Research, Study of the Fair \nHousing Initiatives Program (2011), at iii, available at \nhttps://www.huduser.gov/publications/pdf/fhip_2011.pdf. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 10 of 34\nenforcement activities designed to” investigate housing discrimination, “discover and remedy \ndiscrimination in public and private real estate markets and real estate-related transactions,” and \ndevelop models “to respond to new or sophisticated forms of discrimination” that violate the \nFHA. Id. at (b)(2). These investigation and enforcement activities include testing, technical \nassistance to local fair housing organizations, and funding for litigation costs. Id. In all relevant \nyears, HUD has made PEI awards with a performance period of three or more years.  \n28.  For FHOI grants, the FHA provides that “the Secretary shall use funds made \navailable under this section to enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with qualified fair \nhousing enforcement organizations, other private nonprofit fair housing enforcement \norganizations, and nonprofit groups to build their capacity to provide fair housing enforcement.” \n42 U.S.C. § 3616a(c)(1) (emphasis added). In addition, “[t]he Secretary shall use funds made \navailable under this section to help establish, organize, and build the capacity of fair housing \nenforcement organizations, particularly in those areas of the country which are currently \nunderserved by fair housing enforcement organizations as well as those areas where large \nconcentrations of protected classes exist.” Id. at (c)(2) (emphasis added). \n29.  For EOI grants, the FHA provides that “the Secretary shall establish a national \neducation and outreach program fair housing groups to conduct education and outreach” to \n“prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices.” Id. at (d)(1) (emphasis added); see also \nid. at (d)(2)–(3) The statute further mandates that the Secretary “shall establish or support \neducation and outreach programs at the regional and local levels,” and “shall provide funding to . \n. . support community-based education and outreach activities”) (emphasis added).  \n30.  HUD promulgated regulations to implement the FHIP provision of the FHA. See \n24 C.F.R. § 125 et seq. HUD defined “fair housing enforcement organization” as “any \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 11 of 34\norganization, whether or not it is solely engaged in fair housing enforcement activities, that: (1) \nIs organized as a private, tax-exempt, nonprofit, charitable organization; (2) Is currently engaged \nin complaint intake, complaint investigation, testing for fair housing violations and enforcement \nof meritorious claims; and (3) Upon the receipt of FHIP funds will continue to be engaged in \ncomplaint intake, complaint investigation, testing for fair housing violations and enforcement of \nmeritorious claims.” 24 C.F.R. § 125.103.  \n31.  HUD defined “qualified fair housing enforcement organization” as “any \norganization, whether or not it is solely engaged in fair housing enforcement activities, that—(1) \nIs organized as a private, tax-exempt, nonprofit, charitable organization; (2) Has at least 2 years \nexperience in complaint intake, complaint investigation, testing for fair housing violations and \nenforcement of meritorious claims; and (3) Is engaged in complaint intake, complaint \ninvestigation, testing for fair housing violations and enforcement of meritorious claims at the \ntime of application for FHIP assistance.” Id.  \n32.  HUD restricted eligibility for PEI grants to qualified fair housing organizations—\nthose that have been engaged in intake, investigation, testing, and enforcement activities for at \nleast two years and that are actively engaged in such activities at the time of the application—and \nto organizations with comparable enforcement experience. 24 C.F.R. § 125.401. \n33.  HUD also specified that “FHIP funding is made available in accordance with the \nrequirements of the authorizing statute (42 U.S.C. 3616 note), the regulation in this part, and \nNotices of Funding Availability (NOFAs), and is awarded through a grant or other funding \ninstrument.” 24 C.F.R. § 125.104(c).3  \n \n3 The NOFAs referenced in the regulations are now called NOFOs. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 12 of 34\n34.  In addition to HUD’s own regulations, HUD has incorporated the Office of \nManagement and Budget’s (“OMB”) Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, \nand Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. See 24 C.F.R, § 85.1 (incorporating 2 C.F.R. § \n200.0 et seq.).  \n35.  The OMB regulations impose additional requirements and obligations on federal \nagencies, including the requirements for NOFOs, recipient selection, agency disclosures, \nperformance monitoring, and grant termination.  \nThe FHIP Application and Award Process  \n36.  When Congress appropriates funds pursuant to Section 3616a, consistent with the \nrequirements set forth in the FHA, HUD undertakes a budgeting and planning process, which \nincludes establishing NOFO forecasts, obtaining clearance, and publishing approved NOFOs.4  \n37.  The NOFOs “announce amounts available for award, eligible applicants, and \neligible activities, and may limit funding to one or more of the Initiatives.” 24 C.F.R.  \n§ 125.104(d); see also 2 C.F.R. § 200.204. FHIP NOFOs also “include the specific selection \ncriteria for awards, and will indicate the relative weight of each criterion.” Id. NOFOs also \ninclude instructions for applicants about the funding process and how to apply. Id. \n38.  Absent exigent circumstances, funding opportunities should remain open for at \nleast sixty days. 2 C.F.R. § 200.204(b). \n39.  Before a NOFO is published, the OMB regulations require HUD to create an \nAssistance Listing. An Assistance Listing is a posting in a public government database \nmaintained by the General Services Administration (“GSA”) that describes the grant program’s \n \n4 U.S. Dep’t of Hous. and Urban Dev., HUD Exchange, Grants Management Lifecycle, available \nat https://www.hudexchange.info/onecpd/assets/Image/Grants-Management-Lifecycle-HUD.jpg. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 13 of 34\nstatutory requirements, eligibility requirements for applicants, program goals, estimated funding \nfor the program and source of funds, and how the agency intends to measure progress. 2 C.F.R.  \n§ 200.203(b). The Assistance Listing links to the NOFO for more detail about the award. \n40.  Following publication of a NOFO, qualified fair housing organizations may \nsubmit applications up to a designated deadline. Once the submission window has closed, HUD \nconvenes a Technical Evaluation Panel (“TEP”) to provide a sound, impartial, and \ncomprehensive evaluation of proposals consistent with the guidelines of the applicable NOFO. \nHUD undertakes an initial screening, known as the threshold or intake review. During the \nthreshold review, HUD sets aside ineligible applications and informs those applicants.  \n41.  Applications meeting the minimum eligibility requirements move forward to \npanel review in accordance with the NOFO rating factors. HUD may contact applicants during \nthe review process to clarify application items or identify deficiencies for the applicant to cure.  \n42.  Upon completion of its evaluation, the TEP selects applications and secures \ninternal approvals. HUD then assigns and commits funds for the awards, and the FHA requires \nHUD to notify Congress of the awards at least thirty days before entering into a grant agreement.  \n43.  HUD also issues a grant agreement or Notice of Award to recipients. The \nrecipients and HUD then enter a negotiation phase. During this window, a HUD Government \nTechnical Representative (“GTR”) or Government Technical Monitor (“GTM”) identified in the \naward document will work with grantees to develop a payment schedule based on the deliverable \ndates outlined in the recipient’s Statement of Work.  \n44.  To finalize the award, the parties will have agreed upon all required \nadministrative and program tasks outlined in the approved Statement of Work, all costs outlined \nin the approved budget, the period of performance for the grant and the approved payment \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 14 of 34\nschedule. This agreement is reflected in an Assistance Award signed by both the recipient and by \nHUD, referred to as a HUD-1044. For multi-year grants, a HUD-1044 must be finalized for each \ngrant year in the period of performance.  \n45.  HUD then administers the grants by obligating and contracting funds, reviewing \nand approving payments, and providing technical assistance, among other responsibilities. \n46.  The grantee submits quarterly reports during the life of the FHIP grant, and the \nassigned HUD grant monitor tracks progress and performance.  \n47.  Once all administrative actions and work have been completed, the grantees \nsubmit final reports. HUD then reconciles the grant budget and drawdowns and closes out the \nawards.  \n48.  Under Section 200.1 of the OMB regulations, any action that a federal agency \ntakes to “discontinue a Federal Award . . . before the planned end date of the period of \nperformance” is defined as an award “Termination,” unless that discontinuation occurs due to \nlack of available funds.  \n49.  HUD may lawfully “terminate” a federal award only on the bases set forth in 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340, which include failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, \ntermination by consent or request of the grantee, or, to the extent authorized by law, if an award \nno longer effectuates the program’s goals or agency priorities. If HUD chooses to terminate on \none of these bases, it must provide a written notice of termination as set forth in 2 C.F.R.  \n§ 200.341 and comply with the Administrative Procedures Act.  \n50.  Neither HUD’s nor OMB’s regulations permit the termination of a FHIP grant on \nany basis not set forth in 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 or pursuant to any other procedure. To the contrary, \n24 C.F.R. § 125.401(a) further narrows HUD’s authority with respect to multi-year PEI grants. It \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 15 of 34\nsets out specific authorized bases for termination, providing that “[m]ulti-year funding [for PEI \ngrants] may be contingent upon annual performance reviews and annual appropriations.” By \nimplication, HUD may not stop funding subsequent years of an otherwise-compliant PEI grant \nunless Congress has failed to appropriate funding for FHIP in those subsequent years, or unless \nHUD formally “terminates” the grant pursuant to § 200.340, et seq. \n51.  When the first or second year of a PEI grant comes to an end, grantees sign an \nagreement governing the second or third year of the period of performance.  \n52.  HUD does not require applicants to submit another competitive grant application \nto receive continuing funds, nor could it lawfully do so without following the procedure for \nissuing a new Assistance Listing and NOFO.  \n53.  HUD policy, consistent with its statutory and regulatory requirements, is that each \nyear of a continuing grant will be funded at the level indicated in the original award agreement \nwithout a formal request, subject to appropriations and compliance with program requirements. \nConsistent with Section 3616a and its implementing regulations, HUD’s policy is to fund \ncontinuing years of compliant multi-year FHIP grants so long as Congress appropriates funds for \nFHIP (which it always has).  \nRecent Congressional Appropriations for FHIP Funding \n54.  Congress has appropriated money for FHIP—both for new grants and continuing \nyears of multi-year PEI grants—in all fiscal years relevant to this case.  \n55.  In 2022 and 2023, Congress appropriated $85,000,000 and $86,355,000, \nrespectively, for grants under the FHIP provision, 42 U.S.C. § 3616a. See Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No. 117–103, 136 Stat. 750 “(FY2022 Appropriations Act”); \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 16 of 34\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117–328, 136 Stat. 5166 (“FY2023 \nAppropriations Act”). \n56.  In the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2024, Congress appropriated \n$86,355,000 for “contracts, grants, and other assistance, not otherwise provided for, as \nauthorized by title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.) and section 561 \nof the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (42 U.S.C. 3616a).” Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118–42, 138 Stat. 370. The FY2024 Appropriations Act \nrequires that such funds “remain available until September 30, 2025.” Id. \n57.  HUD has indicated that funds from the FY2024 Appropriations Act are designated \nfor new FHIP awards as well as ongoing PEI awards that were issued in the preceding two years. \nCurrently Active PEI Awards \n58.  At all relevant times, HUD has issued PEI grants that have a multi-year period of \nperformance. A grant’s “period of performance” is “the time interval between the start and end \ndate of a Federal award, which may include one or more budget periods.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.1. \n59.  On September 12, 2022, HUD published its FY2022 PEI NOFO, which \nannounced the availability of $15,000,000 through the PEI Multi-Year Funding Component to \nfund new FY2022 grant awards. Individual applicants were eligible to receive up to $425,000 in \nfunding for the first year of a three-year PEI grant, with funding for a second and third year of \nthe grant subject to future years’ appropriations. \n60.  On March 21, 2023, HUD announced that it was awarding $14,575,000 in new \nPEI grants.5 These grants were issued pursuant to the FY2022 NOFO and were funded by \n \n5 HUD Public Affairs, HUD Awards Over $54 Million to 182 Grantees in 42 States to Fight \nHousing Discrimination, HUD Archives (Jan. 2, 2025), \nhttps://archives.hud.gov/news/2023/pr23-056.cfm. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 17 of 34\nFY2022 appropriations. Thirty-five organizations received new PEI grants, most of which \nreceived $425,000 for their first year6.  \n61.  Recipients of these PEI grants entered into grant agreements with a three-year \nperformance period beginning in 2023. The first year was funded from HUD’s FY2022 budget as \ndescribed in the FY2022 NOFO. Funding for the second and third grant years was subject to \nCongress appropriating sufficient funds in those years (i.e., subject to adequate FY2023 and \nFY2024 appropriations).  \n62.  On September 29, 2023, HUD published its FY2023 NOFO, which announced the \navailability of $16,704,250 through the PEI Multi-Year Funding Component to fund new \nFY2023 grant awards. Individual applicants were eligible to receive up to $425,000 per year for \na three-year duration.  \n63.  On April 2, 2024, HUD announced that it was awarding $16,704,250 in new PEI \ngrants.7 These grants were issued to forty organizations, most of which received $425,000 for \ntheir first year.  \n64.  Recipients of these PEI grants entered into grant agreements with three-year \nperformance periods beginning in 2024. The first year was funded from HUD’s FY2023 budget \nas described in the FY2023 NOFO.

On September 5, 2024, HUD designated $31.7 million from Congress’s FY2024 \nAppropriation to fund active PEI awards.8 HUD directed this portion of the FY2024 \nAppropriation to support the second and third years of seventy-five ongoing multi-year PEI \ngrants first awarded through the FY2022 and FY2023 PEI NOFOs.  \n66.  HUD specified that forty second-year PEI recipients—the same forty \norganizations for which first-year funding was granted pursuant to the FY2023 PEI NOFO—\nwould receive between $400,000 and $425,000 each for a total of $16,937,457.  \n67.  HUD also specified that each of thirty-five third-year PEI recipients—the same \nthirty-five organizations for which first-year funding was granted pursuant to the FY2022 PEI \nNOFO—would receive $425,000 and one third-year PEI recipient would receive $395,749.33 for \na total of $14,845,759.33.  \n68.  Despite this announcement, HUD has refused to administer or implement these \nongoing grants.  \n69.  Early in 2025, HUD representatives worked with as many as thirty-seven \nrecipients of active PEI awards to facilitate the second and third years on their PEI awards. But \nHUD then made the decision to stop implementing active PEI awards.  \n70.  As early as April 16, HUD representatives shared with Active PEI Plaintiffs that \nHUD instructed them not to negotiate the required HUD-1044 contracts for upcoming years of \nactive PEI grants. HUD has maintained this position and has refused to negotiate years two and \nthree of active PEI grants even after the first year of the grant has completed—effectively \n \n8 HUD Public Affairs, HUD Awards Over $32 Million to Fight Housing Discrimination, HUD \nArchives (Sept. 5, 2024), https://archives.hud.gov/news/2024/pr24-227.cfm. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 19 of 34\nimpounding these funds, which cannot be spent in accordance with their appropriated purpose \nwithout HUD taking these steps.  \n71.  For example, Plaintiff NFHA has an active three-year PEI grant, and the first year \nof that grant will end on June 30, 2025. However, a HUD grant officer has repeatedly told NFHA \nthat HUD has instructed her that it cannot move forward with the procedures necessary to begin \nyear two. The HUD representative has been unable to provide information about the elements \nnecessary for completing NFHA’s second-year HUD-1044, such as the statement of work, \nbudget, payment schedule, performance, and deliverables schedule. HUD has similarly refused \nto negotiate years two and three for other Active PEI Plaintiffs.  \n72.  As of this filing, no Active PEI Plaintiff has an executed HUD-1044 for the \nupcoming year of its PEI award.  \n73.  Absent an executed HUD-1044, and the statement of work, budget, and \ndeliverables described within it, grant recipients cannot do further work under their grants \nwithout risking undertaking activities and incurring expenses that HUD may subsequently refuse \nto approve. HUD has told some grant recipients not to do work on their grants at all.  \n74.  HUD has provided no explanation for its refusal to begin subsequent years of \nmulti-year PEI grants, nor has HUD provided the Active PEI Class with any recourse to address \nits refusal to administer their existing grants. \n75.  Consistent with HUD’s decision not to administer FHIP awards, including \nexisting PEI awards, President Trump released a proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2026 on May 2, \nand the proposal zeroes out FHIP funding entirely.9  \n \n9 Office of Mgmt. and Budget, Letter to The Honorable Susan Collins, 27 (2025), available at \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-\nBudget-Request.pdf. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 20 of 34\nHUD Issues NOFOs for Money Available Under its FY2024 Appropriations \n76.  Consistent with Congress’s directives in the FY2024 Appropriations Act and \nSection 3616a(d), on September 20, 2024, HUD published a NOFO announcing the availability \nof approximately $8,350,000 in FY2024 funds under its EOI program “to develop, implement, \ncarry out, and coordinate education and outreach programs designed to inform members of the \npublic concerning their rights and obligations under the FHA.”10 HUD indicated that it expected \nto make approximately sixty-one EOI awards. Applications for these grants closed on November \n19, 2024. \n77.  Consistent with Congress’s directives in the FY2024 Appropriations Act and \nSection 3616a(c), on September 20, 2024 HUD also published a NOFO announcing the \navailability of approximately $3,700,000 in funding under the FHOI program to help build the \ncapacity of nonprofit fair housing organizations and establish new, separate organizations in \nareas that are underserved by existing organizations.11 HUD indicated that it expected to make \napproximately eight FHOI awards. Applications for these grants closed on November 19, 2024. \n78.  Consistent with Congress’s directives in the FY2024 Appropriations Act and \nSection 3616a(b), on September 23, 2024, HUD published the FY2024 PEI NOFO, which \nformally announced the availability of approximately $9,691,793 in FY2024 funding for new \nPEI grants with a four-year performance period.12 The NOFO indicated that HUD expected to \n \n10 Fair Housing Initiatives Program Education and Outreach Initiative, Dep’t of Hous. and Urban \nDev.

In addition to the funding for these new PEI grants, the FY2024 PEI NOFO also \nconfirmed the availability of the approximately $32 million in FY2024 funds for second- and \nthird-year PEI grants that was first announced on September 5, 2024, noting that $32,208,207 in \nFY2024 funds “will be used to fund FY2023 (second year) and FY2022 (third year) grantees \noutside of this NOFO.”13  \n80.  All funds available in the FY2024 NOFOs were appropriated by Congress in the \nFY2024 Appropriations Act. \n81.  In recent years, when HUD has posted NOFOs announcing the availability of \nfunds for new FHIP grants in the fall, it has promptly made awards and announced recipients in \nthe early spring. For example, HUD announced its FY2023 PEI NOFO on September 29, 2023, \napplications closed on December 18, 2023, and HUD announced grantees on April 2, 2024. \nSimilarly, HUD announced its FY2022 PEI NOFO on September 12, 2022, applications closed \non December 5, 2022, and HUD announced grantees on March 21, 2023. \n82.  Consistent with its ordinary timeline, HUD’s FY2024 NOFOs indicated that HUD \nexpected its evaluation period to last approximately ninety days, and that grantees would begin \ntheir performance periods around April 30, 2025. See supra n. 13 at 11, 46. \n83.  HUD has a duty to “execute” the competitive merit review process it has set forth \nin the NOFO to select grant recipients. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.205. Section 3616a requires HUD to \n \n13 U.S. Dep’t of Hous. and Urban Dev., Fair Housing Initiatives Program – Private Enforcement \nInitiative Full Announcement, available at https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/356502.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 22 of 34\nmake FHIP awards if funds are available. It also requires HUD to notify Congress of such \nawards at least 30 days before any grant agreement is finalized.  \n84.  Under the FY2024 Appropriations Act, FY2024 FHIP funds are available only \nuntil September 30, 2025. \n85.  HUD’s ordinary practice would be to convene a review panel, conduct the initial \nreview, evaluate the eligible applications, select recipients, and work with recipients on finalizing \nthe Assistance Award.  \n86.  To date, HUD has not announced or issued any new grants under any of the \nFY2024 NOFOs. No applicant for new FY2024 funds has received any indication from HUD \nthat it intends to announce awards from FY2024 NOFOs or take any step towards doing so in the \nforeseeable future.  \n87.  To comply with the above provisions of Section 3616a, HUD must announce new \ngrantees pursuant to the FY2024 NOFOs by no later than August 31, 2025. If it fails to do so \nbefore that date, then HUD will be unable to comply with the requirement in 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 3616a(e) to notify Congress of FHIP awards “not less than 30 days” before entering into a \ngrant agreement.  \n88.  Consistent with the FY2024 Appropriations Act, HUD must obligate FHIP funds \nfor new awards before the September 30 deadline. A failure to obligate these funds by then \nwould constitute an unlawful impoundment. \n89.  HUD has taken no action to withdraw its FY2024 NOFOs or the Assistance \nListings associated with them. Nor has HUD taken any alternative steps towards obligating the \nFY2024 funds. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 23 of 34\n90.  HUD must expend the entire FY2024 FHIP appropriation unless Congress \nformally rescinds or defers the appropriation. If HUD would like the FY2024 FHIP appropriation \nrescinded, the Executive Branch must formally make a written request to Congress. Both Houses \nof Congress must then act on a bill rescinding the budget authority within 45 days after this \nwritten request, or else the funds must be made available for obligation. If HUD would like the \nFY2024 FHIP appropriation deferred, the Executive Branch must formally make a written \nrequest to Congress showing that the deferral satisfies enumerated criteria. \n91.  President Trump conveyed a list of rescission proposals to Congress on May 28, \n2025, but he did not seek rescission of the FY2024 FHIP appropriation, nor has the Executive \nBranch otherwise conveyed a request to Congress to rescind or defer the FY2024 FHIP \nAppropriation. \nINJURY TO PLAINTIFFS \n92.  Plaintiff NFHA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization that advocates \nfor equal housing opportunity. NFHA’s mission is to end housing segregation and ensure equal \nhousing opportunities for all people and communities through its housing and community \ndevelopment, education and outreach, responsible AI, member services, public policy and \nadvocacy, consulting and compliance, and enforcement initiatives. \n93.  NFHA represents approximately 70 private, nonprofit fair housing organizations \nor operating members, 101 supporting member organizations, and 80 individual members. \n94.  NFHA and its organizational members conduct activities to advance fair housing \nand fair lending for all and to enforce fair housing and fair lending laws, including engaging in \nfair housing policy and advocacy, enforcement, education and outreach; housing counseling; \ncommunicating and working with local community leaders on fair housing and lending rights; \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 24 of 34\nand conducting training about fair housing and lending rights and responsibilities, the harmful \neffects of segregation and other discriminatory practices, and the need to counteract the effects of \nthese harmful practices. \n95.  NFHA applied a three-year PEI grant in November 2023, which it received in \nearly 2024. The grant has a period of performance from July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2027. \nNFHA will complete the first year of the grant on June 30, 2025, but HUD has refused to \nnegotiate year two of this three-year grant.  \n96.  NFHA timely applied for an EOI grant pursuant to HUD’s FY2024 NOFOs. \nNFHA meets all the eligibility requirements for the proposed award and submitted all requisite \nmaterials in support of its application. To date, HUD has not awarded grants from the FY2024 \nEOI NOFO. \n97.  NFHA also timely applied for an FHOI grant pursuant to HUD’s FY2024 NOFOs. \nNFHA meets all the eligibility requirements for the proposed award and submitted all requisite \nmaterials in support of its application. To date, HUD has not awarded grants from the FY2024 \nFHOI NOFO. \n98.  The first year of NFHA’s current multiyear PEI award will expire on June 30, \n2025, and HUD has refused to administer, implement, or finalize the next year of the award. \nHUD’s failure to implement the second year of NFHA’s active PEI grant is causing substantial \nharm to NFHA.  \n99.  Without years two and three of the PEI award, NFHA will lose $400,000 per \nyear—money that would have effectuated Congress’s goal of fair housing enforcement. This is a \nsignificant loss of funding that NFHA relied upon for staffing and operations. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 25 of 34\n100.  NFHA relies on multi-year PEI awards to provide consistency and stability. \nNFHA has undertaken long-term planning of fair housing enforcement activities, including \nsystemic testing and investigations, in reliance on its ongoing PEI award. HUD’s refusal to \nadminister this award has caused budgeting confusion and lack of clarity as NFHA scrambles to \ncover costs and evaluate whether it may continue its planned work.  \n101.  HUD’s failure to award EOI and FHOI grants from the pending FY2024 NOFOs \nis also harming NFHA. As set forth in NFHA’s grant applications, NFHA planned to use these \nfunds to further the goals of the FHA. With the funds, NFHA planned to support the \nestablishment of a new private, full-service fair housing organization in a number of ways, \nincluding: \n•  Provide fair housing assistance to North Carolina residents forced to relocate as \nthe result of Hurricane Helene;  \n•  Hire and train staff on state and federal fair housing laws;  \n•  Train staff on how to conduct fair housing education and outreach to consumers, \nhousing providers, government officials, and others involved in housing issues;  \n•  Train staff on how to perform fair housing tests to investigate complaint-based \nand systemic discrimination in the rental, home sales, and mortgage lending \nmarkets;  \n•  Perform intakes, investigations, and housing counseling for victims of housing \ndiscrimination;  \n•  Recruit and train attorneys to assist victims of housing discrimination;  \n•  File meritorious complaints;  \n•  Complete systemic investigations;  \n•  Conduct fair housing education and outreach;  \n•  Publicize the work of the Fair Housing Council of North Carolina \n102.  If HUD does not issue the FHOI awards, NFHA will not be able to support \nestablishing a new fair housing organization in North Carolina, and the organization will not be \ncreated, leaving North Carolina without a full-service fair housing organization. The absence of a \ngroup providing fair housing services in the state is particularly harmful as there are critical fair \nhousing issues facing North Carolina residents in the wake of Hurricane Helene.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 26 of 34\n103.  In addition to the direct injuries to NFHA, NFHA members are harmed by HUD’s \nrefusal to administer FHIP funding. Many of NFHA’s organizational members rely on FHIP \nfunding to conduct their day-to-day fair housing operations, and many could not survive in the \nabsence of FHIP funding. HUD’s refusal to implement active PEI awards and to award new \ngrants from the pending NOFOs has caused NFHA’s members to stop work, turn away clients, \ncancel leases, and lay off staff members. It also prevents NFHA members from partnering with \nNFHA itself on multi-jurisdictional investigations or projects. NFHA’s members have also been \nplunged into budgeting chaos and confusion.  \n104.  HUD’s failure to administrate FHIP also jeopardizes many NFHA members’ \nability to remain eligible for future PEI grants. Because PEI grants may only be awarded to \norganizations that currently engage in – and have recent experience with – complaint intake and \ninvestigation, testing for fair housing violation and enforcement of meritorious claims, the loss of \nFY2024 funding for PEI grants may reduce the likelihood that many grantees will be eligible in \nsubsequent years.  \n105.  HUD’s actions and failures to act have injured and are injuring NFHA members, \nsuch that many individual NFHA members would have standing to bring a suit. \n106.  One NFHA member has already had to close due to HUD’s failure to finalize a \ncontinuing year’s PEI grant. The Greater Houston Fair Housing Center (“GHFHC”), which \nrelied on FHIP funding to continue operations, closed its programs at the end of May 2025. \nGHFHC was in its second year of a three-year PEI grant, but HUD has been unwilling to finalize \nyear three of the grant, which was GHFHC’s only source of funding. \n107.  Plaintiff TFHC is another NFHA member experiencing great harm. TFHC’s PEI \ngrant ended on May 31, 2025. Throughout the multi-year period of performance for this grant, \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 27 of 34\nTFHC met or exceeded its goals for deliverables on this grant. TFHC received $375,000 for Year \n1 and $425,000 per year for Years 2 and 3 through its PEI award, which accounted for 85% of its \noperating budget. \n108.  In anticipation of the May 31 expiration of its PEI grant, TFHC applied for a new \nPEI grant through the FY2024 PEI NOFO. As before, TFHC sought $425,000 per year, an \namount that would cover the vast majority of its annual $500,000 operating budget.  \n109.  Because PEI grants are limited to qualified and/or experienced fair housing \norganizations, because TFHC met all eligibility requirements, and because TFHC had met or \nexceeded its goals for the previous PEI grant and most recently had received an excellent \nperformance rating from HUD, TFHC had a reasonable expectation of receiving a new PEI \naward from the FY2024 PEI NOFO. \n110.  HUD’s failure to issue new awards is causing TFHC substantial harm. In the \nabsence of a new award, TFHC will begin terminating employees at the end of this month. \n111.  The loss of funding and staff will directly limit the number of clients that TFHC is \nable to serve. In particular, TFHC will not be able to help FHA-protected clients who face \nevictions; will not be able to support unrepresented housing discrimination complainants as they \nnavigate the upcoming closure of the Tennessee Human Rights Commission; and will not be able \nto help as many people with disabilities obtain reasonable accommodations.  \n112.  As a result of HUD’s failure to issue new PEI awards, TFHC has already stopped \nall testing work and systemic investigations, including an active investigation into discriminatory \nadvertising practices. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 28 of 34\n113.  The unavailability of a new PEI award will fundamentally alter TFHC’s \noperations and may force the organization to close entirely if it cannot find replacement funding \nin the next year.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n114.  Plaintiff NFHA brings this Complaint as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a) and 23(b)(2) on behalf of itself and similarly situated grantees.  \n115.  Plaintiff NFHA seeks to certify a class consisting of: all other fair housing \norganizations who received multi-year PEI awards in 2023 or 2024 but who have been unable to \nnegotiate their second or third years with HUD. \n116.  This action is properly maintained as a class action for the following reasons:  \na.  Joinder. Joinder of all class members is impracticable because of the size, \ngeographic dispersal, and financial precarity of the class. Thirty-six organizations \nreceived multi-year PEI awards from HUD but have been unable to negotiate their \nsecond and third years. The class is readily ascertainable because it is defined by \nobjective factors. The proposed class includes organizations spread across the \ncountry in approximately twenty different states. Because class members are, by \ndefinition, non-profit organizations with limited resources, and because the \nconduct at issue in this case is further limiting class members’ resources, it would \nnot be possible for each organization to pursue claims individually.  \nb.  Commonality. The claims alleged on behalf of the proposed class exclusively \nraise questions of law and fact that are common to the class. Each class member \nreceived a multi-year PEI grant pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3616a and associated \nregulations; each class member’s grant should run for at least one additional year; \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 29 of 34\nand each class member was in compliance with the terms of the grant. Common \nquestions of law and fact include, among others: \ni.  Whether HUD may lawfully refuse to implement the second and third \nyears of class members’ active PEI grants;  \nii.  Whether HUD has provided class members with notice and an opportunity \nto be heard as required by both the OMB regulations and the Due Process \nClause; \niii.  Whether HUD’s failure to administer active PEI grants creates an unlawful \nimpoundment of Congressionally appropriated funds.  \nc.  Typicality. The claims of the class representative are typical of the class because \nthe class representative received a multi-year PEI grant pursuant to the same \nstatute and regulations as the other class members and, like other class members, \nhas been unable to negotiate the contract for the next year of its PEI award.  \nd.  Adequacy. The class representative and class counsel will fairly and adequately \nrepresent the interests of the class. The class representative has no interests that \nare antagonistic to the interests of other class members, and class counsel have \nyears of experience in class action and civil rights litigation.  \ne.  Appropriateness for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Defendant has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, refusing to negotiate \nclass members’ second and third years of their PEI awards. The requested relief, \nordering HUD to administer FHIP awards, including by negotiating contracts for \nactive PEI awards, will resolve all class members’ harm. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 30 of 34\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCount I \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \nBrought by All Plaintiffs \n \n117.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n118.  The APA provides that a reviewing court “shall” “compel agency action \nunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  \n119.  Congress appropriated $86,355,000 under Section 3616a in the FY2024 \nAppropriations Act. HUD awarded $31.7 million of that appropriation for second- and third-year \nfunding for active PEI grants. HUD also issued NOFOs that earmarked approximately $21.7 \nmillion of that appropriation for new PEI, FHOI, and EOI awards.  \n120.  HUD is now refusing to administer or implement existing PEI grants and refusing \nto award new FHIP grants from the pending FY2024 NOFOs.  \n121.  HUD’s refusal to administer FHIP grants violates the mandatory language in the \nFHIP provision of the FHA; violates the FY2024 Appropriations Act; and violates the regulations \nthat govern FHIP grants. \n122.  This Court can compel HUD to administer FHIP awards as required by law.   \nCount II \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) \nBrought by All Plaintiffs \n \n123.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n124.  The APA provides that a reviewing court “shall” “hold unlawful and set \naside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law”; that is “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity”; or \nthat is “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 31 of 34\n125.  HUD has decided not to administer FHIP funding that was duly appropriated by \nCongress, both by refusing to administer or implement existing PEI grants and by refusing to \naward new FHIP grants from the pending FY2024 NOFOs.  \n126.  HUD’s unexplained and unjustified refusal to administer FHIP funding is \narbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. \n127.  HUD’s refusal to administer FHIP grants is contrary to law because it violates the \nmandatory language in the FHIP provision of the FHA, the FY2024 Appropriations Act, the \nregulations that govern FHIP grants, and the Constitution. \n128.  HUD’s refusal to administer FHIP grants is contrary to constitutional rights \nbecause it violates separation of powers, the Appropriations Clause, and the Due Process Clause. \n129.  This Court can set aside HUD’s decision and compel HUD to administer FHIP \nawards as required by law.  \nCount III \nAppropriations Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7 \nBrought by All Plaintiffs  \n \n130.  Plaintiff restates and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n131.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin Executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution.  \n132.  The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution provides: “No Money shall be \ndrawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law[.]” U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 9, cl. 7. The Clause protects Congress’s exclusive power over the federal purse. The \nExecutive Branch does not have constitutional authority to override or disregard Congress’s \nappropriations.  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 32 of 34\n133.  HUD’s unlawful impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds infringes on \nCongress’s exclusive power over the federal purse. That exclusive power is conferred and \nprotected in part by the Appropriations Clause, and the Executive has no constitutional authority \nto countermand it. \n134.  This Court can compel HUD to abide by the Constitution by obligating and/or \nexpending appropriated funds.  \nCount IV \nSeparation of Powers \nBrought by All Plaintiffs \n \n135.  Plaintiff restates and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here.  \n136.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution.  \n137.  HUD’s unlawful impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds exceeds the \nExecutive Branch’s constitutional authority and impermissibly usurps the legislature’s power, in \nviolation of the Separation of Powers. See U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7; \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1; U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2. \n138.  This Court can compel HUD to abide by the Constitution by obligating and/or \nexpending appropriated funds.  \nCount V \nViolation of the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V \nBrought by Active PEI Plaintiffs \n \n139.  Plaintiff restates and realleges all paragraphs above as if fully set forth here. \n140.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “No person shall \nbe . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 33 of 34\n141.  HUD’s refusal to negotiate second and third-year PEI contracts violates the Due \nProcess Clause because it effectively terminates active PEI grants without notice or process in \ndisregard of the Active PEI Plaintiffs’ substantial reliance interests in their continued receipt of \nsuch funding. \n142.  Active PEI Plaintiffs have a protected property interest in their continued receipt \nof PEI funding. A protected property interest lies where a party has a legitimate and reasonable \nreliance on a promise from the state, such as a grant agreement. Property rights protect those \nclaims upon which people rely in their daily lives, and that reliance may not be arbitrarily \nundermined. HUD regulations provide that multi-year PEI grants can be terminated only for poor \nperformance or lack of appropriations, and HUD has not made a finding that either applies. \n143.  The degree of pre-deprivation process to which someone is entitled under the Due \nProcess Clause depends upon whether the recipient’s interest in avoiding that loss outweighs the \ngovernmental interest in summary adjudication. \n144.  The loss of active PEI grants would have a devastating effect on the Active PEI \nPlaintiffs, forcing many of them to close entirely. By contrast, HUD has no legitimate interest in \nallowing already appropriated and obligated funding to lapse.  \n145.  Given Active PEI Plaintiffs’ weighty interest in their PEI grants and HUD’s non-\nexistent interest in abrogating those rights, the Active PEI Plaintiffs were entitled to meaningful \npre-deprivation process, including notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Plaintiffs did \nnot receive any process at all. \n146.  This Court can compel HUD to abide by the Constitution by administering Active \nPEI Plaintiffs’ ongoing PEI awards.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965     Document 1     Filed 06/24/25     Page 34 of 34\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant them the following relief: \na.  Certify a class pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \nb.  Declare HUD’s refusal to administer FHIP grants unlawful; \nc.  Order HUD to administer FHIP awards, including but not limited to requiring \nHUD to: \ni.  Ensure all outstanding FY2024 FHIP funds are obligated before \nSeptember 30;  \nii.  Implement the second and third years of Active PEI Plaintiffs’ ongoing \nPEI awards; and \niii.  Issue awards and finalize contracts for the FY2024 NOFOs;  \nd.  Award plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and \ne.

Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan \n   \nU.S. DEP'T OF HOUSING AND URBAN \nDEVELOPMENT, et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nAlmost sixty years ago, Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act to  combat rampant \ndiscrimination in housing plaguing vulnerable communities across our country. And recognizing \nthat it would take more than the federal government to end housing discrimination, for more than \nthree decades Congress has provided annual funding through the Fair Housing Initiatives Program \n(FHIP) to ensure dedicated enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. The United States Department \nof Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for administering the FHIP program \nand awarding grants to private nonprofit fair housing organizations on an annual basis. And while \nHUD may select the grant recipients and make other decisions about how to use or allocate the \nfunds appropriated by Congress, it may not refuse to award those funds altogether. Congress made \nclear that HUD “shall” use the funds, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3616a(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and it must do so \nannually by the end of each fiscal year, i.e., September 30, see Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n2024, Pub. L. No. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 370. \nThe Plaintiffs in this case are fair housing organizations that have worked hand in hand \nwith HUD for decades through the FHIP program. They claim that HUD has now taken the \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 2 of 30\nunprecedented step of halting its grantmaking activities, and they fear that HUD will not meet the \nfast-approaching September 30, 2025, deadline to award millions of dollars appropriated by \nCongress for FHIP grants this fiscal year. The Plaintiffs’ claims fall into two categories. The first \nchallenges HUD’s failure to complete the grantmaking process for the 2024 fiscal year. And the \nsecond challenges HUD’s failure to implement multi-year grants from prior years by withholding \nthe second or third years of funding. HUD’s delayed processing has already had a lasting impact. \nOrganizations that expected continued funding have shuttered or are at risk of shuttering. The \nPlaintiffs brought this lawsuit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution \nto challenge HUD’s conduct, and they recently moved for a temporary restraining order.  \nHUD tells a different story. It admits that it is taking longer than usual to process FHIP \ngrants and that it temporarily paused grantmaking activity for the first time in the program’s \n30-year history. But it maintains that it plans to meet the upcoming statutory deadline, and it argues \nthat the Court lacks jurisdiction to even hear this case until after that deadline has come and gone. \nIf HUD blows past the deadline, however, the appropriated funds are no longer available for \nawards for the current fiscal year. And HUD takes the position that the Court has no authority to \norder that the funds be held or remain available through the conclusion of this litigation. If HUD \nis correct, it is free to ignore duly enacted and constitutional statutes directing it to award millions \nof dollars in grant funding by a certain date and this Court is powerless to hear the dispute or take \nsteps to ensure compliance with the statutes. That is not the law.  \nThe Court has jurisdiction to hear the Plaintiffs’ claims. When it comes to the claims \nconcerning new grants, the organizations have identified an imminent injury. Based on the current \nrecord, there does not appear to be sufficient time for HUD to take the necessary steps between \nnow and September 30, 2025, to award funds in compliance with the statutes. The Court also finds \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 3 of 30\na likelihood of success on the merits on at least two claims—either of which is sufficient at this \nstage. And because irreparable harm and the balance of equities and public interest weigh in the \nPlaintiffs’ favor, a temporary restraining order is warranted. For the claims concerning the \nmulti-year grants, the Plaintiffs have asked the Court to defer its ruling until later this week. \nWhile the Court agrees that the Plaintiffs are entitled to emergency relief, it is not \nconvinced that all of the Plaintiffs’ requested relief is appropriate at this time. The Plaintiffs ask \nthe Court to order the appropriated funds for the current fiscal year remain available through the \npendency of this litigation and to order HUD to comply with its statutory obligations, including \nby setting certain deadlines for the processing of new grants. With two months left until the \nSeptember 30, 2025, deadline, the Court orders only that the agency comply with its statutory \nobligations and that it come up with a detailed plan to do so. If it becomes clear in the coming \nweeks that HUD will not meet the statutory deadline, the Court will revisit the Plaintiffs’ remaining \nrequests. The Court thus grants in part the Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, \nthough on narrower terms than the Plaintiffs requested. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background \nCongress enacted the Fair Housing Act (FHA) in 1968 “following urban unrest of the mid \n1960s and in the aftermath of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,” H.R. Rep. \nNo. 100-711, at 15 (1988) (cleaned up), to “provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair \nhousing throughout the United States,” 42 U.S.C. § 3601. The FHA thus made it unlawful to \n“refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or \nrental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, \nreligion, or national origin.” Fair Housing Act, Pub. L. No. 90-284, § 804, 82 Stat. 73, 83 (1968) \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) (Supp. IV 1968)). And the FHA also made it unlawful to \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 4 of 30\n“discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a \ndwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith” on the basis of the \nsame  protected  characteristics.  Id.  Congress  later  amended  the  FHA  to  add  sex,  disability, \nand familial status as additional protected characteristics. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), (b), (f)(1); \nsee also id. §§ 3604(f)(2), 3605–06. \n“Under  the  1968  Act,  limited  enforcement  powers  were  available  to  the  federal \ngovernment,  and,  therefore,  private  entities  played  the  primary  role  of  enforcing  the  law.” \nLawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Fred Freiberg’s Amicus Br. Supp. Plaintiffs’ \nMot. TRO at 19 (Amicus Brief), ECF No. 20-2. “In 1988, the Fair Housing Initiatives Program \nwas  established  to  assist  all  parties  in  fighting  housing  discrimination.”  Id.  In 1992,  after \nrecognizing “the proven efficacy of private nonprofit fair housing enforcement organizations and \ncommunity-based efforts” that were serving as “a necessary component of the fair housing \nenforcement system,” Pub. L. 102-550, § 905(a)(9), 106 Stat. 3672, 3869, Congress amended the \nFHA to provide sustainable support for these organizations, see id § 905(b). Congress made FHIP \npermanent and authorized FHIP funds to implement various programs. Id. \nSince 1992, FHIP “has been supported by members of Congress from both parties.” \nAmicus Brief at 20. And if Congress has appropriated funds, the FHA requires HUD to use those \nfunds for three purposes: private enforcement initiatives (PEI), fair housing organizations, and \neducation and outreach. See 42 U.S.C. § 3616a. These grants are meant to fund “programs or \nactivities designed to obtain enforcement of the rights granted by” the FHA. Id. And for all three \ntypes of grants, statutory language provides that the Secretary shall use the funds made available. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 3616a(b)(1) (“The Secretary shall use funds made available under this subsection \nto conduct, through contracts with private nonprofit fair housing enforcement organizations, \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 5 of 30\ninvestigations of violations of the rights granted under [the FHA], and such enforcement activities \nas appropriate to remedy such violations.”); id. § 3616a(c)(1) (“The Secretary shall use funds made \navailable under this section to enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with qualified fair \nhousing  enforcement  organizations,  other  private  nonprofit  fair  housing  enforcement \norganizations, and nonprofit groups organizing to build their capacity to provide fair housing \nenforcement[.]”); id. § 3616a(d)(1) (“The Secretary, through contracts with one or more qualified \nfair housing enforcement organizations, . . . shall establish a national education and outreach \nprogram” to “provide a centralized, coordinated effort for the development and dissemination of \nfair housing media products[.]”). \nOnce funding is available, HUD publishes Notices of Funding Availability (NOFAs), \n24 C.F.R. §§ 125.104(c), (d), also known as NOFOs, see, e.g., 2 C.F.R. § 200.204. The NOFOs \n“announce amounts available for award, eligible applicants, and eligible activities, and may limit \nfunding to one or more of the Initiatives.” 24 C.F.R. § 125.104(d); see also 2 C.F.R. § 200.204. \nAbsent exigent circumstances, funding opportunities are to remain open for at least thirty calendar \ndays. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.204(b). And before announcing a NOFO, HUD “must . . . create an \nAssistance Listing,” id. § 200.202(a)(1), which describes “the statutory or regulatory requirements \nof the program and its intended outcome,” “[g]eneral eligibility requirements,” and the like, \nid. § 200.203(b). \nFollowing publication of a NOFO, qualified applicants may submit applications up to a \ndesignated deadline after which applications will not be accepted for review by HUD. U.S. Dep’t \nof Housing and Urban Development, HUD FHIP Application and Award Policies and Procedures \nGuide 23 (Sept. 2017) (FHIP Guide), https://perma.cc/SQ92-BD3N. “All FHIP applications” are \nthen “evaluated through use of a HUD approved review criteria.” Id. at 43; see also id. at 21 \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 6 of 30\n(“The application  should  present  the  merits  of  the  proposed  project  and  provide  sufficient \napplication information to enable HUD Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) reviewers to evaluate \nthe application in accordance with the FHIP review criteria established by HUD.”). The team of \nreviewers then makes award recommendations to HUD. See id. at 58–59. Under the FHA, \nHUD must notify Congress of any “proposed grant, contract, or cooperative agreement” at least \nthirty days “before providing a grant or entering into any contract or cooperative agreement[.]” \n42 U.S.C. § 3616a(e).  \n“Immediately following grant award approval,” HUD and the grant recipients enter into a \nnegotiation phase, FHIP Guide at 65, during which a Government representative will work with \ngrantees “to develop a payment schedule based on the deliverable dates outlined in the Statement \nof Work,” id. at 66. The process ends in “a binding agreement between HUD and the grantee that \ndetails the terms and conditions for award and the amount of funds awarded based on the \napplication submission and the available funds.” Id. For multi-year grants, grantees “are required \nto  approve  and  sign  a  new  grant  agreement”  annually.  Id.  at  82.  A  grant’s  “[p]eriod  of \nperformance” is “the time interval between the start and end date of a Federal award, which may \ninclude one or more budget periods.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.1. \nAs relevant here, Congress appropriated money for FHIP in 2022, 2023, and 2024. \nSee Consolidated Appropriations Act 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-103, 136 Stat. 49, 750; Consolidated \nAppropriations  Act,  2023,  Pub.  L.  No.  117-328,  136  Stat.  4459,  5166;  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118–42, 138 Stat. 25, 370. In 2024, Congress appropriated \n$86,355,000 for “contracts, grants, and other assistance, not otherwise provided for, as authorized \nby title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 . . . and section 561 of the Housing and Community \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 7 of 30\nDevelopment Act of 1987[.]” Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118–42, \n138 Stat. 25, 370. And this money is “available until September 30, 2025.” Id. \nB.  Factual Background \n“The following facts are alleged in the Complaint or drawn from declarations in the record \nthat are not disputed in relevant part, except where otherwise noted.” Postal Police Officers Ass’n \nv. U.S. Postal Serv., 502 F. Supp. 3d 411, 415 (D.D.C. 2020). \nIn September 2024, HUD published a “FY2024 PEI NOFO, which formally announced the \navailability of approximately $9,691,793 in FY2024 funding for new PEI grants with a four-year \nperformance period.” Compl. ¶ 78, ECF No. 1 (citation omitted). It also published a FY2024 \nNOFO “announcing the availability of approximately $3,700,000 in funding . . . to help build the \ncapacity of nonprofit fair housing organizations and [to] establish new, separate organizations in \nareas that are underserved by existing organizations.” Id. ¶ 77. And it did the same for the third \ncategory  of  FHIP  funding,  publishing  a  FY2024  NOFO  “announcing  the  availability  of \napproximately $8,350,000 in FY2024 funds under its EOI program to develop, implement, carry \nout, and coordinate education and outreach programs designed to inform members of the public \nconcerning their rights and obligations under the FHA.” Id. ¶ 76 (cleaned up). “All funds available \nin the FY2024 NOFOs were appropriated by Congress in the FY2024 Appropriations Act.” \nId. ¶ 80.  And applications  for  all  of  these  grants  closed  in  November  2024.  Id.  ¶¶  76–78. \nThe FY2024 NOFOs “indicated that HUD expected its evaluation period to last approximately \nninety days, and that grantees would begin their performance periods around April 30, 2025.” \nId. ¶ 82.

Yet as of today, “HUD has not announced or issued any new \ngrants under any of the FY2024 NOFOs.” Compl. ¶ 86.  \nAlso  in  September  2024,  “HUD  designated  $31.7  million  from  Congress’s  FY2024 \nAppropriation to fund active PEI awards.” Id. ¶ 65. It directed this money to support the “second \nand third years of seventy-five ongoing multi-year PEI grants first awarded through the FY2022 \nand FY2023 PEI NOFOs.” Id. But HUD has refused to implement some of these multi-year grants. \nId. ¶ 68. More specifically, it has “refused to negotiate years two and three of active PEI grants \neven after the first year of the grant has completed[.]” Id. ¶ 70.  \nThe National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), founded in 1988, is a “national, nonprofit \npublic service membership organization,” id. ¶ 20, that “represents approximately 70 private, \nnonprofit fair housing organizations or operating members, 101 supporting member organizations, \nand 80 individual members,” id. ¶ 93.

Procedural Background \nNFHA and TFHC filed a Complaint in this Court on June 24, 2025, suing HUD and its \nSecretary for various constitutional and APA violations. See id. On July 7, 2025, the Plaintiffs \nfiled a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. See Pls.’ Mot. TRO. The Court held a hearing \non July 24, 2025. After that hearing, both Parties filed status reports at the Court’s request. \nSee Defs.’ Status Report, ECF No. 22; Pls.’ Status Report, ECF No. 23. In their status report, \nthe Plaintiffs asked the Court to “stay resolution of the portion of the Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order regarding the [multi-year grants.]” Pls.’ Status Report at 2. The Plaintiffs’ \nmotion  for  emergency  relief  is  fully  briefed  and  ripe  for  review.  See  Defs.’  Opp’n  TRO, \nECF No. 15; Pls.’ Reply TRO, ECF No. 18.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA temporary restraining order is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon \na clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). A plaintiff seeking a temporary restraining order must establish “that he is \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 10 of 30\nlikely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.” Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 724 (D.C. Cir. 2011). And a plaintiff “need only \nestablish a likelihood of success on the merits of one claim to obtain . . . injunctive relief[.]” A.B.-B. \nv. Morgan, 548 F. Supp. 3d 209, 218 (D.D.C. 2020) (citation omitted). \nDISCUSSION \n  Having considered the Parties’ filings and their representations at oral argument, the Court \nwill grant in part the Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. As to the claims \nconcerning new grants, the Plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood of organizational \nstanding, a likelihood of success on the merits for at least two of those claims, that they would \nsuffer an irreparable injury without relief, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest \nfavor them. And as to the Plaintiffs’ claims concerning multi-year grants, the Court believes relief \nis likely warranted but will reserve judgment given the Plaintiffs’ request that it stay resolution of \nthese claims until later this week. \nA.  New Grants \nThe Plaintiffs challenge HUD’s failure to award new grants using the 2024 appropriated \nfunds under the Appropriations Clause, see Compl. ¶¶ 130–34, and the Separation of Powers, \nsee id. ¶¶ 135–38. They also claim that it violates 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), see Compl. ¶¶ 123–29, \nbecause it is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, see Pls.’ Mot. TRO at 34–38, and 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(1), see Compl. ¶¶ 117–22, since the funds were allegedly withheld unlawfully and delayed \nunreasonably, see Pls.’ Mot.

Standing \n“The first component of the likelihood of success on the merits prong usually examines \nwhether the plaintiffs have standing in a given case.” Nat’l Immigr.

Supp. 3d 16, 25 (D.D.C. 2020) (cleaned up). “To have \nstanding  to  bring  a  temporary  restraining  order,  Plaintiffs  must  adduce  record  evidence \nestablishing a substantial likelihood that ‘(i) they have “suffered a concrete and particularized \ninjury in fact, (ii) that was caused by or is fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant, \nand (iii) is capable of resolution and likely to be redressed by judicial decision.”’” Gomez v. \nTrump, No. 20-cv-1419, 2020 U.S. Dist.

Lake, No. 25-cv-1015, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76500, \nat *20 (D.D.C. Apr. 22, 2025) (cleaned up). Organizational standing requires an organization, \n“like an individual plaintiff, to show actual or threatened injury in fact that is fairly traceable to \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 12 of 30\nthe alleged illegal action and likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.” People for the \nEthical Treatment of Animals v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, 797 F.3d 1087, 1093 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(cleaned up). When it comes to the injury-in-fact requirement, it is sufficient for the organization \nto  “show  that  the  defendant’s  actions  cause  a  ‘concrete  and  demonstrable  injury  to  the \norganization’s activities’ that is ‘more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social \ninterests.’” Widakuswara, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76500, at *22 (quoting Am. Soc’y for Prevention \nof Cruelty to Animals v. Feld Ent., Inc., 659 F.3d 13, 25 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (cleaned up)); see also \nNat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA, 667 F.3d 6, 11 (D.C.

And they have both done more than enough to establish a “substantial \nlikelihood” of organizational standing. Gomez, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110132, at *19. They have \nidentified a concrete future harm because HUD’s failure to issue new grants by the deadline will \nrob them of the opportunity for funding. See Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Pierce, 814 F.2d \n663,  668  (D.C.  Cir.  1987)  (“Their  complaint  identifies  concrete  organizational  interests \ndetrimentally  affected  by  HUD’s  actions—curtailment  of  the  opportunity  for  funding  and \nassistance.”). And they have argued that this harm is imminent because “HUD does not even \ncontend that the process to administer the awards has advanced to the stage necessary to make the \nawards on a permissible schedule prior to the appropriations deadline[.]” Pls.’ Reply TRO at 5. \nThe Court agrees. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 13 of 30\nThe Court is skeptical that HUD could issue awards under the FY2024 NOFOs before the \nstatutory deadline. HUD would still need to “execute a merit review process of applications for \ndiscretionary Federal awards,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.205, and it originally estimated this process would \n“last[] for approximately 90 days” for the PEI NOFO, see U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., Fair \nHousing Initiatives Program—Private Enforcement Initiative Full Announcement (Sept. 2024), \navailable for download at https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/356502; see also Pls.’ \nMot. TRO, Ex. 7 at 46, ECF No. 11-8. That means if the review process were to begin today, \nit would reasonably be expected to finish around October 27, 2025, well after the September 30, \n2025,  statutory  deadline,  see  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act,  2024,  Pub.  L.  No.  118–42, \n138 Stat. 25, 370 (appropriating $86,355,000 to “remain available until September 30, 2025”). \nAnd more importantly, HUD said at oral argument and in a status report that there are no plans to \nissue awards under the FY2024 NOFOs and that it plans on publishing new NOFOs instead. \nSee Motions Hr’g (July 24, 2025), Tr. at 36:13– 37:14, ECF No. 21 (“I believe HUD’s plan is to \nproceed with new NOFOs.”); Defs.’ Status Report at 2 (“HUD plans to publish the new NOFOs \nas soon as possible and in time for the subject grant applications to be allocated by September 30, \n2025.”). \nThe Court is even more skeptical that HUD could meet the deadline were it to list new \nNOFOs. HUD would first need to create an Assistance Listing with a description of the grant \nprogram. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.202(a); see also id. § 200.203(b). Then the new NOFOs would need \nto be made available for application for at least thirty days in the absence of exigent circumstances. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 14 of 30\nSee 2 C.F.R. § 200.204(b).1 And then HUD would have to process the applications, select new \ngrantees, engage in negotiations, and finalize all paperwork before funds will eventually be \nobligated. See supra, at 5–6. The Plaintiffs’ declarant stated that in her experience, it can take up \nto four weeks “for HUD and the grantee to  complete and sign the required documents[.]” \nKemple Decl. ¶ 13, ECF No. 11-2. And HUD’s declarant does not assuage this Court’s concerns. \nHe stated that “HUD is doing everything it can on an expedited basis to issue new/first-year FHIP \nawards and [to] execute grant agreements . . . before the FY24 FHIP funds lapse.” Cooke Decl. \n¶ 5, ECF No. 15-1. But promising to try your best falls well short of guaranteeing, or even \npredicting, success. Nor does it eliminate the laundry list of outstanding tasks.2 This is especially \ntrue given that HUD has never had to complete this process in such a short timeframe in the history \nof the FHIP program. See Motions Hr’g (July 24, 2025), Tr. at 32:14–18 (“HUD concedes through \nthe briefing that this year in 2025 it has taken longer to administer FHIP grants than it did in the \nyears preceding under the previous administration.”); Defs.’ Status Report at 3–4 (noting that \n \n1 HUD stated at oral argument that there are currently no plans to rely on exigent circumstances to \nshorten this period. See Motions Hr’g (July 24, 2025), Tr. at 38:11–12 (“I’m not suggesting to the \nCourt that HUD has made a finding that there are exigent  circumstances in  this case[.]”); \nid. at 40:25–41:2 (“I have seen no indication that HUD intends to use the exigent circumstances \nexception, so presumably the NOFOs would be available for 30 days.”). But in a status report filed \nafter oral argument, it stated that “if necessary, the application period may be shorter than 30 days.” \nDefs.’ Status Report at 2. Given the time remaining before the statutory deadline, the Court \nassumes that HUD will rely on exigent circumstances to shorten the 30-day period, though that \ndecision is of course one that the Court leaves to HUD at this juncture. \n2 At oral argument, the Court gave HUD an opportunity to file a status report detailing its plans to \nmeet the statutory deadline. HUD’s report states that it “plans to publish the new NOFOs as soon \nas possible and in time for the subject grant applications to be allocated by September 30, 2025.” \nDefs.’ Status Report at 2. And without providing specifics, it says that it “plans to complete \napplication review and determine awards under the new NOFOs by mid-September 2025.” Id. at 3. \nWithout more from HUD, and in light of the declarations submitted by the Plaintiffs, the Court \ncannot find that HUD is likely to meet the statutory deadline. The Parties will, of course, have an \nopportunity to develop the record further at the preliminary injunction phase and convince the \nCourt otherwise. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 15 of 30\n“HUD  has  not  identified  any  . .  .  instances”  of  the  agency  “temporarily  paus[ing]  FHIP \ngrantmaking activity”).  \nNFHA  and  TFHC’s  asserted  imminent  injury  is  therefore  “certainly  impending  and \nimmediate—not remote, speculative, conjectural, or hypothetical.” Gomez, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n110132, at *19 (cleaned up). This is not a case where funding can reasonably be expected to be \ndoled out by the appropriations deadline. See, e.g., Child. Trends, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nNo. 25-cv-1154, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111199, at *27 (D. Md. June 11, 2025) (“Here, the crucial \ndeadline Plaintiffs identify in relation to their Program Claims is September 30, 2025, when the \nfunds set aside by Congress for Comprehensive Centers and RELs in the 2024 Appropriations Act \nwill lapse. That date is far enough away to make it difficult for the Plaintiffs to argue, and the \nCourt to  decide, that the harm of losing the opportunity to  bid  is  imminent  and therefore \nirreparable.” (citation omitted)). And the imminent injury is traceable to the Defendants’ actions \nand would be remedied by a court order requiring the funds to be spent. NFHA and TFHC have \ntherefore established a “substantial likelihood” of organizational standing. Gomez, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 110132, at *19. \nb.  Ripeness \nThe Defendants next argue that the Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe for review. See Defs.’ \nOpp’n TRO at 5–7; see also id. at 5 (“Article III requires that an alleged injury be ‘certainly \nimpending.’” (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013))); id. at 7 \n(“Plaintiffs’ speculation about future harm . . . is insufficient to establish a case or controversy as \nrequired by Article III and cannot form the basis for the Court’s jurisdiction.”). And both sides \nacknowledge that these arguments track those presented on the standing question. See id. at 8 \n(“For the same reasons that Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe, Plaintiffs lack standing.”); Pls.’ Reply \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 16 of 30\nTRO at 8 (“Defendants’ standing argument is simply a repackaging of their ripeness argument[.]”); \nsee  also  DKT  Mem’l  Fund  v.  Agency  for  Int’l  Dev.,  887  F.2d  275,  297  (D.C.  Cir.  1989) \n(“[T]he constitutional requirement for ripeness is injury in fact.”). The Court therefore reaches the \nsame conclusions on ripeness as it did on standing. \nc.  Merits \nThe “Plaintiffs need only establish a likelihood of success on the merits of one claim to \nobtain the injunctive relief that they seek.” A.B.-B., 548 F. Supp. 3d at 218 (citation omitted). \nAnd the Court finds that they are likely to succeed on the merits of at least two of their claims \nconcerning the new grants: (1) that HUD’s failure to award new grants for the current fiscal year \nviolates the Separation of Powers, see Pls.’ Mot. TRO at 17–19, and (2) that the new grants have \nbeen unreasonably delayed in violation of Section 706(1), see id. at 29–33. Either provides a \nsufficient basis for injunctive relief on this record. See A.B.-B., 548 F. Supp. 3d at 218. \ni.  Separation of Powers \nThe  Plaintiffs  argue  that  “[t]he  separation-of-powers  principles  embedded  in  the \nConstitution require HUD to disburse Congress’s FHIP appropriation.” Pls.’ Mot. TRO at 19. \n“Under ‘settled, bedrock principles of constitutional law,’ the President ‘must follow statutory \nmandates so long as there is appropriated money available and the President has no constitutional \nobjection to the statute.’” AIDS Vaccine Coal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 770 F. Supp. 3d 121, 145 \n(D.D.C. 2025) (quoting In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 259 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J.)). \nThe Defendants do not argue that the statutory mandate in this case is unconstitutional—to the \ncontrary, they assert that they are working to follow that mandate. Defs.’ Opp’n TRO at 20; \nsee also Motions Hr’g (July 24, 2025), Tr. at 49:16–20 (responding “Correct” when asked, “So just \nto clarify, I don’t see any argument from you that the statutory mandate here is unconstitutional; \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 17 of 30\nis that right?”). But the Court is not convinced that they are likely to meet the deadline on this \nrecord.  Allowing  the  funding  to  lapse  would  therefore  violate  the  Separation  of  Powers. \nSee AIDS Vaccine Coal., 770 F. Supp. 3d at 143–48. So the Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of this claim. \nThe Defendants raised a counterargument for the first time at oral argument, arguing that \nonly Congress may bring a Separation of Powers claim. See Motions Hr’g (July 24, 2025), \nTr. at 51:8–10  (“The  only  proper  plaintiff  for  this  separation  of  powers  claim  would  be \nCongress[.]”). But they cited no case law to support this claim. In the absence of any briefing or \nother  support  from  the  Defendants,  and  because  other  courts  in  this District  have  allowed \nSeparation of Powers claims by private plaintiffs to proceed, see, e.g., AIDS Vaccine Coal., \n770 F. Supp. 3d at 143–48, the Defendants’ late-breaking argument does not move the needle. \nSee also Free Enterprise Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010) \n(pushing back against the claim that the Supreme Court has not “recognized an implied private \nright of action directly under the Constitution to challenge governmental action under . . . \nseparation-of-powers principles” because the Government “offer[ed] no reason and cite[d] no \nauthority” for why a “separation-of-powers claim should be treated differently than every other \nconstitutional claim”). \nii.  Unreasonable Delay \nThe Plaintiffs also argue that “HUD’s delay in acting on [the] Plaintiffs’ FY2024 NOFOs \nis . . . unreasonable.” Pls.’ Mot. TRO at 31. And the APA provides that reviewing courts “shall . . . \ncompel agency action . . . unreasonably delayed[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). The Defendants respond \nwith two threshold arguments. See Defs.’ Opp’n TRO at 9–12, 16–18. But neither is convincing, \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 18 of 30\nand the Defendants have conceded any non-threshold arguments. See infra, at 24. So the Plaintiffs \nare likely to succeed on the merits of this claim.3 \n1.  Tucker Act \nThe Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs’ claims should be channeled to the Court of \nFederal Claims because they sound in contract. Defs.’ Opp’n TRO at 9–12. More specifically, \nthey argue that the Tucker Act impliedly forbids the Plaintiffs’ APA claims. See id. \nIt is true that the D.C. Circuit has “interpreted the Tucker Act . . . to impliedly forbid[] \ncontract claims against the Government from being brought in district court under the waiver \n[of sovereign  immunity]  in  the  APA.”  Perry  Cap.  LLC  v.  Mnuchin,  864  F.3d  591,  618 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). But it has also “explicitly rejected the ‘broad’ notion ‘that any case \nrequiring some reference to or incorporation of a contract is necessarily on the contract and \ntherefore directly within the Tucker Act’ because to do so would ‘deny a court jurisdiction to \nconsider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than a contractual relationship with \nthe government.’”  Crowley  Gov’t  Servs.,  Inc.  v.  Gen.  Servs.  Admin.,  38  F.4th  1099,  1107 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 967–68 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). \n“Exclusive jurisdiction in Claims Court under the Tucker Act does not lie merely because \n \n3 The Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs do not challenge a final agency action. See Defs.’ \nOpp’n TRO at 14–16. But that requirement does not apply to unreasonable delay claims brought \nunder Section 706(1). See Am. Oversight v. U.S. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 498 F.

Supp. 3d at 136 (emphasis in original) (quoting Crowley \nGov’t Servs., Inc., 38 F.4th at 1106 (cleaned up)). And “[t]hat inquiry turns on (1) ‘the source of \nthe  rights  upon  which  the  plaintiff  bases  its  claims,’  and  (2)  ‘the  type  of  relief  sought \n(or appropriate).’” Id. (quoting Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc., 38 F.4th at 1106 (cleaned up)). \nThe first prong favors the Plaintiffs because the source of their unreasonable delay claim \nis the APA—not contract law. And the second prong favors them as well since they do not seek \nmoney damages. See id. at 135 (“The complaints do not seek money damages.”). While the \nrequested injunctive relief may cause “the release of funds withheld,” id., the Supreme Court has \n“long recognized” that “[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to \nanother is not a sufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages,’” Bowen v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988). For example, the D.C. Circuit has held that a request \nfor “injunctive relief enjoining defendants from reducing funds otherwise due to plaintiffs” \nwas “not a claim for money damages, although it [was] a claim that would require the payment of \nmoney by the federal government.” Md. Dep’t of Hum. Res. v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \n763 F.2d 1441, 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Bork, J.) (cleaned up). It explained that “any funds that \nwould flow to the plaintiff as a result of agency action being held unlawful under the APA were \nnot ‘money in compensation for the losses, whatever they may be, that [the plaintiff] will suffer or \nhas suffered by virtue of the withholding of those funds.’” AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coal., \n770 F. Supp. 3d at 136 (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 895 (quoting Md. Dep’t of Hum. Res., 763 F.2d \nat 1446)). That is the case here as well. The Plaintiffs do not seek compensation for any ancillary \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 20 of 30\nharms that have befallen them due to the delay in granting new awards for the current fiscal year. \nIndeed, they do not even demand that they be chosen for the new grants. They only request that \nHUD  “[i]ssue  and  finalize  contracts  for  the  FY2024  NOFOs.”  Compl.,  Prayer  for  Relief. \nThe Tucker Act therefore does not make this APA claim unreviewable. \nThe Defendants point to a recent Supreme Court order to argue that this is essentially a \ncontract claim. See Defs.’ Opp’n TRO at 11–12 (citing Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. \n966 (2025) (per curiam)). There, the Court stayed a district court order “enjoining the Government \nfrom terminating various education-related grants” and requiring “the Government to pay out \npast-due grant obligations and to continue paying obligations as they accrue.” Dep’t of Educ., \n145 S. Ct. at 968. It explained that the Government was “likely to succeed in showing the District \nCourt lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” since “the APA’s limited \nwaiver of immunity does not extend to orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’ \nalong the lines of what the District Court ordered here.” Id. (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity \nIns. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212 (2002)). But the APA claim in that case “was premised on \nthe  terms  of  individual  grants.”  AIDS  Vaccine  Advocacy  Coal.  v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of  State, \nNo. 25-cv-400, 2025 WL 1380421, at *3 (D.D.C. May 13, 2025) (citation omitted). “And the \ngovernment repeatedly urged this distinction in its briefing before the Supreme Court.”  Id. \n(citations omitted). That is not the case here, where the Plaintiffs bring this claim without reliance \non any specific grant terms. Nor do the Plaintiffs ask for an injunction requiring HUD to \nnecessarily provide them funds; they ask only that HUD complete its grantmaking process for the \ncurrent fiscal year as it is statutorily required to do. See Compl., Prayer for Relief. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 21 of 30\n2.  Agency Discretion \nThe Defendants also argue that the challenged action is not subject to judicial review under \nthe APA because it is committed to agency discretion by law. See Defs.’ Opp’n TRO at 16–18; \nsee also 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) (“This chapter applies . . . except to the extent that . . . agency action \nis committed to agency discretion by law.”). They point to Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993), \nsee Defs.’ Opp’n TRO at 16–18, which explained that “an agency’s allocation of funds from a \nlump-sum appropriation requires a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are \npeculiarly within its expertise,” Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 193 (cleaned up). Lincoln went on to hold \nthat an agency’s decision to discontinue a certain program and to redirect money to a different \nprogram was “unreviewable under § 701(a)(2).” Id.  \nBut that language from Lincoln does not control this case. The Plaintiffs “do not challenge \nHUD’s allocation of certain amounts to various grant programs within FHIP or the allocation of \ncertain amounts to various applicants to FHIP; they challenge HUD’s refusal to administer the \nprogram and make awards at all, which is not a decision within its lawful discretion.” Pls.’ Reply \nTRO at 19. Indeed, Lincoln itself was careful to state that “an agency is not free simply to disregard \nstatutory responsibilities[.]” 508 U.S. at 193. And it held that “the decision to allocate funds [was] \n‘committed to agency discretion by law,’” id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)), only “to [the] extent” \nthat “the agency allocates funds from a lump-sum appropriation to meet permissible statutory \nobjectives,” id. (cleaned up). On this record, the Court is therefore unpersuaded that Lincoln \nforecloses relief. \n3.  TRAC Factors \nHaving found that the Defendants’ threshold arguments do not preclude this Court’s \nreview, the Court now turns to the Plaintiffs’ claim that HUD’s delay is unreasonable. “Courts in \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 22 of 30\nthis circuit consider six factors (the ‘TRAC factors’) when evaluating unreasonable-delay claims: \n(1) the time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a rule of reason; (2) where \nCongress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with which it expects the agency \nto proceed in the enabling statute, that statutory scheme may supply content for this rule of reason; \n(3) delays that might be reasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when \nhuman health and welfare are at stake; (4) the court should consider the effect of expediting \ndelayed action on agency activities of a higher or competing priority; (5) the court should also \nconsider the nature and extent of the interests prejudiced by delay; and (6) the court need not find \nany  impropriety  lurking  behind  agency  lassitude  in  order  to  hold  that  agency  action  in \nunreasonably delayed.” Palakuru v. Renaud, 521 F. Supp. 3d 46, 49 (D.D.C. 2021) (cleaned up) \n(citing Telecomms. Rsch. & Action Ctr. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70. 80 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). “The D.C. \nCircuit  has  emphasized  that  ‘[r]esolution  of  a  claim  of  unreasonable  delay  is  ordinarily  a \ncomplicated and nuanced task requiring consideration of the particular facts and circumstances \nbefore the court.’” Id. (quoting Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council, Inc. v. Norton, 336 F.3d \n1094, 1100 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). \nThe third and fifth factors favor the Plaintiffs. A declarant for TFHC stated that “HUD’s \nfailure to award new PEI grants under the FY2024 NOFO has had a significant and immediate \nimpact  on  [its]  ability  to  serve  [its]  communities.”  Lafferty  Decl.  ¶  18,  ECF  No.  11-4. \nShe explained that TFHC has had to cut its staff size in half, id. ¶ 19, and that it “will likely have \nto decrease [its] primary service area by one-third or more,” id. ¶ 20. And she even shared that \nTFHC is “now unable to provide any testing services at all[.]” Id. ¶ 21. This matters because private \nand local fair housing organizations process about seventy-six percent of fair housing complaints \nin the nation. See Pls.’ Mot. TRO at 32 (citing National Fair Housing Alliance, 2024 Fair Housing \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 23 of 30\nTrends Report 6 (2024), https://nationalfairhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2024-Fair-\nHousing-Trends-Report-FINAL_07.2024.pdf). So their decreased capacity to enforce the FHA \nrisks poorer health outcomes for the public. See id. n.13 (citing Roshanak Mehdipanah, Without \nAffordable,  Accessible,  and  Adequate  Housing,  Health  Has  No  Foundation,  The  Milbank \nQuarterly, 101 No. S1, 419, 425–26 (2023), https://perma.cc/7P8G-WBAS). And the fourth factor \nappears to favor the Plaintiffs as well since the Defendants have not identified any competing \npriorities, nor is this a case where the Plaintiffs are asking to be moved to the front of a line, \nsee, e.g.,  Shen v. Pompeo,  No.  20-1263,  2021  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  67950,  at  *22–23 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2021). The sixth factor is neutral since the current record does not support any \nfinding of “impropriety lurking behind agency lassitude.” Da Costa v. Immigr. Inv. Program Off., \n80 F.4th 330, 345 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (cleaned up). \nBut factors one and two are more complicated. They “require the court to consider whether \nthere is any rhyme or reason—congressionally prescribed or otherwise—for the agency’s delay.” \nAhmed v. Blinken, 759 F. Supp. 3d 1, 11 (D.D.C. 2024) (cleaned up). And HUD has provided a \nreason for the delay: It was meant to allow FHEO to “review the prior Administration’s policies \nand to align FHEO’s grantmaking activity with the new Administration’s priorities.” Cooke Decl. \n¶ 4. On the other hand, there is a congressionally prescribed timeline that requires HUD to provide \nfunding before September 30, 2025, and the unreasonable delay claim is premised on the idea that \nthe Defendants have waited too long to meet that deadline. And Congress has prescribed an even \nmore compressed timeline in this case because the same statutory section requiring HUD to spend \nFHIP funds also requires HUD to notify Congress of any “proposed grant, contract, or cooperative \nagreement” at least thirty days before providing that grant or entering that contract or cooperative \nagreement. 42 U.S.C. § 3616a(e)(1). \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 24 of 30\nIn their briefing, the Defendants did not respond to the Plaintiffs’ arguments that the TRAC \nfactors weigh in their favor, thus conceding this point, see LCvR 7(b); Texas v. United States, \n798 F.3d 1108, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“[Local Rule 7(b)] is understood to mean that if a party \nfiles an opposition to a motion and therein addresses only some of the movant’s arguments, \nthe court may treat the unaddressed arguments as conceded.” (citations omitted)); cf., e.g., Parham \nv. District of Columbia, 648 F. Supp. 3d 99, 106 (D.D.C. 2022) (“Defendants conceded these \npreliminary injunction factors by failing to respond to Plaintiffs’ arguments whatsoever in its \nopposition papers.” (citations omitted)); Endo Par Innovation Co. v. Becerra, No. 24-cv-999, \n2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104947, at *12 (D.D.C. May 1, 2024) (saying this concession rule applies \nwith particular force when a plaintiff “need only demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits” \ninstead of “an absolute certainty of success” (cleaned up)). And when pressed at oral argument, \nthe Defendants affirmed that they were relying on the threshold arguments the Court addressed \nabove. See Motions Hr’g (July 24, 2025), Tr. at 61:10–11 (“I agree that our briefing did not address \nthe TRAC factors[.]”); id. at 61:15–17 (responding when the Court asked, “So you’re resting your \nargument on Lincoln[?],” with “Yes, on Lincoln and just the threshold arguments under the APA”). \nHaving considered the Plaintiffs’ arguments and the record before the Court, and in the absence of \nany argument whatsoever from HUD, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \nthe merits of their unreasonable delay claim at this stage of the proceedings. \n2.  Irreparable Harm \nThe irreparable harm analysis is fairly straightforward in this case. The Plaintiffs have \nexplained that they will suffer several harms without a temporary restraining order. See Pls.’ Mot. \nTRO at 39 (“HUD’s refusal to administer FHIP awards has already forced Plaintiffs to close \noffices, downsize, and lay off staff, posing an existential threat to TFHC and other NFHA \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 25 of 30\nmembers’ survival.”). And these are the types of harms that courts have held to be irreparable. \nSee Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 763 F. Supp. 3d 36, 57 (D.D.C. 2025) (“Some of these \norganizations are still waiting for funds to be disbursed . . . . In the meantime, they’ve been forced \nto dismiss employees, cut essential programs, and pay workers out of their own pockets . . . . Each \nday that the pause continues to ripple across the country is an additional day that Americans are \nbeing denied access to programs that heal them, house them, and feed them. Because the funding \nfreeze threatens the lifeline that keeps countless organizations operational, Plaintiffs have met their \nburden of showing irreparable harm.”); Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Teacher Educ. v. McMahon, \n770 F. Supp. 3d 822, 858 (D. Md. 2025) (“Plaintiffs have made a clear showing that their members \nwill  suffer  irreparable  harm  in  the  absence  of  an  injunction.  According  to  the  supporting \ndeclarations, the loss of funding will cause some Grant Recipients to shutter their programs \nentirely.”), reconsideration denied, 2025 WL 863319 (D. Md. Mar. 19, 2025). \n3.  Balance of Equities and Public Interest \nThe final two factors merge when the Government is a party. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 435 (2009). “[C]ourts must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the \neffect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief[,] . . . pay[ing] particular \nregard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.” Winter, \n555 U.S. at 24 (cleaned up). On the side of the Defendants, “[t]here is generally no public interest \nin the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.” League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016). “To the contrary, there is a substantial public interest in having \ngovernmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.” \nId. (cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Plaintiffs have provided evidence that their work enforcing the \nFHA would suffer dramatically from a lack of funding. See Pls.’ Mot. TRO at 38–42. These factors \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 26 of 30\ntherefore favor the Plaintiffs. See, e.g., S. Educ. Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 25-cv-1079, \n2025 WL 1453047, at *17 (D.D.C. May 21, 2025) (“As for defendants’ public interest argument, \nany theoretical harms to members of the public who are opposed to EAC-South receiving grant \nfunding do not outweigh the alleged concrete, irreparable harm in the form of programmatic \nclosures and loss of funding that SEF has already experienced.”). \nB.  Multi-Year Grants \nThe Plaintiffs also bring claims challenging HUD’s failure to implement multi-year grants. \nThese include grants to NFHA and its members. See Pls.’ Mot. TRO at 1 (“[NFHA] should have \nstarted the second year of its multi-year FHIP grant on July 1, but HUD refused to finalize the \npaperwork.”); Pls.’ Reply TRO at 12 (“All of those Active PEI Plaintiff organizations are before \nthe Court because they are members of NFHA[.]”). They allege that HUD’s failure to administer \nthese multi-year grants violates the Appropriations Clause, see Compl. ¶¶ 130–34; see also Pls.’ \nMot. TRO at 16–17, the Separation of Powers, see Compl. ¶¶ 135–38; see also Pls.’ Mot. TRO \nat 17–19, and procedural due process, see Compl. ¶ 141. They also claim that it violates 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2), see Compl. ¶¶ 123–29, because it is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, see Pls.’ \nMot. TRO at 34–38, and 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), see Compl. ¶¶ 117–22; Pls.’ Mot. TRO at 23–33, \nbecause the funds have been unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed. \nAt this stage, the Court is persuaded that NFHA has standing for its procedural due process \nand Section 706(1) claims. And it sees good reasons why NFHA would likely be entitled to \ninjunctive relief as to the Section 706(1) claim for unreasonable delay, particularly because HUD \nconceded the TRAC factors. See supra, at 24. But the Court will reserve judgment on these issues \ngiven the Plaintiffs’ request that it “stay resolution of the portion of the Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order regarding [these] claims[.]” Pls.’ Status Report at 2. The Court instead orders \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 27 of 30\nHUD to submit a status report on August 1, 2025, that confirms whether all multi-year grantees \n“have been authorized to start work under the upcoming year of their existing PEI grants” and \nwhether  “HUD  remains  on  track  to  meet  the  beginning-of-August  projection  for  finalized \npaperwork.” Id. \nREMEDIES \nHaving found that the Plaintiffs are entitled to temporary injunctive relief with respect to \nnew grants, the Court turns to remedies. The Plaintiffs ask for very broad remedies. First, they \nseek an order that FY2024 FHIP funding “shall remain available through the pendency of this \nlitigation and the implementation of any final relief.” Pls.’ Proposed Order at 1, ECF No. 11-11 \n(citing 31 U.S.C. § 1502(b)). But given that the September 30, 2025, lapse date will not arrive for \ntwo months, the Court finds it premature to grant this relief now. The Court will revisit whether \nsuch an order is necessary in the coming weeks to ensure that the appropriated funds do not lapse \nand remain available for obligation. And, of course, if HUD’s assurances bear true, there will be \nno need for the Court to issue a further order.4  \n \n4 The Defendants argue that the Court may not order that the appropriated funds remain available \nthrough the pendency of this litigation. Defs.’ Opp’n TRO at 12 n.1. Because the Court declines \nto enter such an order now, it need not decide this question for purposes of resolving the instant \nmotion. But the Court notes that the D.C. Circuit has blessed this approach. See City of Houston v. \nDep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (“[O]ur decisions specifically \nprovide that if a case is timely filed, a court may grant a preliminary injunction so that funds from \nthe appropriation that is about to lapse will remain available pending a dispute’s resolution.”); \nsee also Nat’l Ass’n of Reg’l Councils v. Costle, 564 F.2d 583, 588 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“In such \nsituations, the courts simply suspend the operation of a lapse provision and extend the term of [the] \nalready existing budget authority.”). And the Defendants conceded at oral argument that the D.C. \nCircuit did not overrule this line of cases in Goodluck v. Biden, 104 F.4th 920 (D.C. Cir. 2024). \nSee Motions Hr’g (July 24, 2025), Tr. at 57:24–58:5 (responding when the Court asked, “Do you \nthink that the Goodluck case overruled the Costle line of cases?,” with “No, I don’t think it \noverruled it. It just criticized it.”).  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 28 of 30\nSecond, the Plaintiffs ask the Court to order HUD to comply with its statutory obligations, \nincluding by setting detailed deadlines for particular tasks and ordering HUD to move forward \nwith the FY2024 NOFOs instead of posting new ones. See Pls.’ Proposed Order; Pls.’ Status \nReport at 2–3. But at this point, the Court orders only that HUD comply with its statutory \nobligations under the Fair Housing Act, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 3616a(b)(1) (“The Secretary shall \nuse funds made available under this subsection to conduct, through contracts with private nonprofit \nfair housing enforcement organizations, investigations of violations of the rights granted under \n[the FHA], and such enforcement activities as appropriate to remedy such violations.”);  id. \n§ 3616a(c)(1) (“The Secretary shall use funds made available under this section to enter into \ncontracts or cooperative agreements with qualified fair housing enforcement organizations, other \nprivate nonprofit fair housing enforcement organizations, and nonprofit groups organizing to build \ntheir capacity to provide fair housing enforcement[.]”); id. § 3616a(d)(1) (“The Secretary, through \ncontracts with one or more qualified fair housing enforcement organizations, . . . shall establish a \nnational education and outreach program” to “provide a centralized, coordinated effort for the \ndevelopment and dissemination of fair housing media products[.]”), before the appropriations \nlapse on September 30, 2025, see Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-42, \n138 Stat. 25, 370. See AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coal., 770 F. Supp. 3d at 154 (finding in a similar \nposture that “[t]he appropriate remedy is . . . to order [the] Defendants to ‘make available for \nobligation the full amount of funds Congress appropriated’ under the relevant laws” (quoting City \nof New Haven v. United States, 634 F. Supp. 1449, 1460 (D.D.C. 1986), aff’d, 809 F.2d 900 \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 29 of 30\n(D.C. Cir. 1987)).5 Again, the Court will revisit whether it is appropriate to be more prescriptive \nin the coming weeks as the case develops. \nThe  Court  orders  HUD  to  file  a  status  report  by  August  4,  2025,  that  provides  a \ndetailed plan regarding how it intends to meet its statutory obligations for new grants for the \ncurrent fiscal year. In its July 25, 2025, status report, HUD states that it “plans to publish the new \nNOFOs as soon as possible and in time for the subject grant applications to be allocated by \nSeptember 30, 2025.” Defs.’ Status Report at 2. And it says that it “plans to complete application \nreview and determine awards under the new NOFOs by mid-September 2025.” Id. at 3. The Court \nis heartened to hear that “HUD is already working to assemble and train a large enough review \nteam” and that it has “established expedited procedures for completing the award recommendation \nand approval process.” Id. In its August 4, 2025, status report, HUD should provide a specific \ntimetable with anticipated completion dates for all the tasks that must be accomplished in order \n \n5 At oral argument, the Defendants appeared to agree that this relief in appropriate. See Motions \nHr’g (July 24, 2025), Tr. at 62:8–12 (“We understand that the Court is considering requiring status \nreports. We think that would adequately satisfy any concerns from [the] plaintiff[s] and it would \ngive HUD the opportunity to explain its progress to the Court without imposing any requirements \nthat exceed the statutory text[.]”). They argued in their briefing that the broad remedies requested \nby the Plaintiffs would violate the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in  Trump v. CASA, Inc., \n145 S. Ct. 2540 (2025). See Defs.’ Opp’n TRO at 12–14. But when presented with the above \nnarrower remedy, they conceded that it would not run afoul of CASA. See Motions Hr’g (July 24, \n2025), Tr. at 54:1– 9 (“The CASA argument was more to address the plaintiffs’ proposed order . . . . \nBut hearing what we heard today, I think Your Honor is correct that CASA does not apply.”). \nNor could it. “HUD cannot peel off TFHC, NFHA, and NFHA members and conduct a FHIP grant \ncompetitive process just for them.” Pls.’ Reply TRO at 14 (citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.205). So the Court \nis left providing a remedy with incidental benefits to applicants not before the Court. See CASA, \n145 S. Ct. at 2557 (“To afford the plaintiff complete relief [from a noisy neighbor], the court has \nonly one feasible option: order the defendant to turn her music down—or better yet, off. That order \nwill necessarily benefit the defendant’s surrounding neighbors too; there is no way to peel off just \nthe portion of the nuisance that harmed the plaintiff.” (cleaned up)). And the Court is even less \ntroubled considering the Plaintiffs’ “estimate that 75% of FHIP applicants are NFHA members.” \nPls.’ Reply TRO at 14 (citing Second Kemple Decl. ¶ 13, ECF No. 18-1). \n \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01965-SLS     Document 24     Filed 07/28/25     Page 30 of 30\nfor grants to be obligated by September 30, 2025. The Court orders HUD to file status reports \nevery seven days after the August 4, 2025, status report to detail its progress.  \nThe Court further orders the Parties to meet and confer and to file a joint status report by \nJuly 29, 2025, at 5:00 PM. In that joint status report, the Parties should advise whether they consent \nto extending the current temporary restraining order beyond 14 days. If not, the Parties shall \npropose an expedited preliminary injunction briefing schedule. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part the Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order, ECF No. 11. \nA separate order will issue. \n \n \n \nSPARKLE L.
