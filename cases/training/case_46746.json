    "summary": "<p>This case challenged Florida's and the Trump Administration's construction of an immigration detention facility dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Everglades. The facility was built in mere days, which plaintiffs alleged circumvented or ignored regulatory and environmental standards. Designed to hold up to 5,000 noncitizens at a time, the facility was located on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Although the airport was located in Collier County, 36 miles west of Miami, it was owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by that county's aviation department. Miami-Dade County regulations limited the use of the site to aviation purposes. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated that the facility's construction was requested, and would be fully bankrolled, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Plaintiffs alleged violations of: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and Miami-Dade County Code.&nbsp; They also alleged that defendants' actions were <em>ultra vires&nbsp;</em>(i.e., in excess of their legal authority to act).</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs were two Florida-based environmental nonprofits, Friends of the Everglades and Center for Biological Diversity. On June 27, 2025, they filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS and its Secretary; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Acting Director; the Florida Division of Emergency Management and its Executive Director; and Miami-Dade County. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants' actions were unlawful, an injunction against the continued construction and use of the facility for non-aviation purposes including immigration detention, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Jose E. Martinez. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; they renewed that motion on July 17, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>On June 30, 2025, Miami-Dade County filed its response. The County argued that the state of Florida had commandeered the airport under state emergency authority and that it could not use county law to restrain the state; additionally, the County contended that plaintiffs did not have a right of action to compel the County to enforce its own regulations. The same day, the Executive Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management filed his response, arguing that plaintiffs' complaint alleged only violations of federal law which did not bind him and his state agency.</p>\r\n<p>On July 3, 2025, DHS and ICE filed their response. The federal agencies argued that plaintiffs' case was likely to fail because it did not challenge a final agency action, and did not show that they would suffer an irreparable harm from the detention center's construction given Supreme Court precedent that NEPA violations do not give rise to a presumption of irreparable injury.</p>\r\n<p>On July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the case. The Tribe noted that Big Cypress National Preserve, which included the land co-opted to build the detention center, had traditionally been part of its home and that the center's continued construction and operation would accelerate the land's environmental degradation. The court granted the Tribe's motion to intervene on July 30, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>Two days later, Judge Martinez recused himself from the case. The case was automatically reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.</p>\r\n<p>On July 28, 2025, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited discovery. 2025 WL 2253243. Defendants were ordered to produce any agreements among themselves relating to Alligator Alcatraz. The next day, defendants filed a motion requesting limited reciprocal discovery from plaintiffs; that motion is still pending before the court.</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, 2025, while a multi-day hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was ongoing, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' renewed motion for a limited temporary restraining order. First, it noted that it would withhold ruling on the defendants' venue challenge until the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing. It further rejected defendants' challenge to the court's jurisdiction, reasoning that because the plaintiffs did not seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of any immigration statute, the statute cited by the defendants to assert lack of jurisdiction was inapplicable.&nbsp; As to the TRO, the court concluded that, at minimum, the federal defendants' legal control over the facility's operations, evidence that it was constructed at the request of DHS, and regular inspections of the site by ICE officials, as well as undisputed lack of prior environmental assessment under NEPA, created a sufficient likelihood of success of the merits of the APA claim to warrant preliminary relief. Citing minimal harm to the defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the facility and the difficulty of reversing course at a later date, the court entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the state and federal defendants from installing any additional industrial-style lighting, doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing, or doing any other site expansion including placing or erecting buildings and other structures. The TRO was to last fourteen days from the date of the order or until the court entered an order on the preliminary injunction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, 2025, after a hearing, the court granting in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 242325. First, it again found that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claim, which neither challenged the fact nor the manner of detention or removal, nor sought to halt, suspend, or alter operation of any INA provision, nor otherwise challenged the defendants' authority to implement or enforce immigration laws (as would preclude jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252).&nbsp; Next, the court held that the defendants had waived challenge to venue in the Southern District of Florida by litigating the case on the merits for a month before raising venue issues.&nbsp; Rejecting the venue argument on the merits, it reasoned that the NEPA claim did not involve \"real property\" within the meaning of the applicable venue statute and therefore that venue was proper in the Southern District as the home of plaintiff's principal place of business, and not required to lie in the Middle District of Florida, where the facility is located.&nbsp; Moreover, a substantial portion of events that gave rise to the lawsuit took place within the Southern District, and some of the environmental concerns relevant to the NEPA claim would also affect the Southern District. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. As to a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs' NEPA claims, the court noted that the defendants did not dispute the \"major\" environmental effects that would justify the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment.&nbsp; Moreover, the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an impact statement or conducting an assessment was a definitive position that caused actual, concrete injury to the plaintiffs' recreational and conservational interests, and therefore constituted a final agency action. In addition, evidence the federal defendants requested that the facility be built and committed federal funding precluded them from disclaiming involvement or responsibility under NEPA.&nbsp; The environmental risks posed by the facility threatened irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, and the balance of equities and the public interest similarly favored granting the preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional industrial-style lighting (so-called &ldquo;Sunbelt&rdquo; lighting); or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential or administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons onto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time the order went into effect. The preliminary injunction did not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities that were made for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site. It further ordered that after no more than sixty days, and once population attrition allowed for safe implementation, the defendants were to remove 1) the temporary fencing in order to allow tribe members access to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the facility was built; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting installed for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed for this project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That same day, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, appealing the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On August 23, 2025, the defendants filed a district court motion to stay the injunction pending appeal and, on August 26, 2025, they filed a similar motion in the appellate court.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit Court stayed the preliminary injunction on September 4, 2025. The court based its decision to stay off of&nbsp;<em>Seven County</em>, a recent Supreme Court decision bringing \"NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense.\" The court found that the plaintiffs were likely to fail on their NEPA and APA claims. To trigger the EIS requirement under NEPA, an action must be both a major federal action and a final agency action. The Eleventh Circuit rejected the argument that the collusion between FDEP and other federal agencies to transform the TNT site into a mass detention center constituted a major federal action. This is attributed to the fact that neither DHS nor ICE has committed federal funding to the project, which is a required element of a \"major federal action\" under the Eleventh Circuit Court's interpretation of NEPA. The court rejected the argument that the failure of a federal agency to prepare an EIS on its own can constitute a final agency action under the APA.</p>\r\n<p>The dissent criticized the majority opinion for its interpretation of the APA and for ignoring the factual record established by the district court. Judge Jordan alleged that the appellate review was \"devoid of any deference\" and that \"even if the majority could ignore those determinations, it cannot balance the equities by removing all the weight from one side of the scale.\"</p>\r\n<p>Following the stay, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration by en banc. The government then moved to stay this appeal.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Defendant Guthrie filed a Response in Opposition (DE 56). For the \nreasons set forth below, the Motion (DE 55) is GRANTED IN PART. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn June 27, 2025, Plaintiffs Friends of the Everglades, Inc., and Center for \nBiological Diversity (together, “Plaintiffs”) filed a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, \nclaiming, among other things, that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and \nActing Director of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) Todd \nLyons (together, “Federal Defendants”), Executive Director of the Florida Division of \nEmergency Management (“FDEM”) Kevin Guthrie, and Miami-Dade County, together \napproved, funded, constructed, and operate a federal detention center known as “Alligator \nAlcatraz” at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (“TNT”) in violation of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) and other federal, state, and local law. (DE \n1). The same day, Plaintiffs filed an Expedited Motion for Temporary Restraining Order \n(“TRO”) and Preliminary Injunction (“PI”) (DE 5), which they later altered in their Renewed \nPage 1 of 5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 64   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/28/2025   Page 2 of 5\nMotion for TRO (DE 40). The Court has set a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motions for injunctive \nrelief  on  August  6,  2025.  (DE  54).  Plaintiffs  filed  the  instant  Motion  for  Expedited \nDiscovery (DE 55) on July 24, 2025, requesting an order compelling responses to certain \ndocument  requests  and  interrogatories  from  Defendant  Guthrie  and  the  Federal \nDefendants, and compelling Defendant Guthrie to permit a site visit to TNT. (DE 55-1–5). \nPlaintiffs argue the limited discovery will shed light on the Defendants’ contentions that \nfederal agencies have not controlled the construction and operation of the detention \ncenter on TNT, and “thereby assist the Court in evaluating the issues” to be discussed \nduring the August 6, 2025 hearing. Defendants counter, most notably, that it would be \nprejudicial to impose on Defendants, on such a short timeline, such broad, unilateral \ndiscovery obligations as Plaintiffs request. (DE 56 at 3–5). \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n“Control over the course of discovery and scheduling is committed to the ‘broad \ndiscretion’ of the court.” TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. SCS Supply Chain LLC, 330 F.R.D. \n613, 615 (S.D. Fla. 2019) (quoting Johnson v. Bd. of Regents, 263 F.3d 1234, 1269 (11th \nCir. 2001)). “Pursuant to [Federal] Rule [of Civil Procedure] 26(d) and (f), federal courts \nin their discretion may allow parties to conduct expedited discovery in advance of a Rule \n26(f) conference where ‘good cause’ for such discovery is shown.” Id. (citations omitted). \nIn  turn,  “Good  cause  may  be  found  where  the  need  for  expedited  discovery,  in \nconsideration of the administration of justice, outweighs the prejudice to the responding \nparty.” Semitool, Inc. v. Tokyo Electron Am., Inc., 208 F.R.D. 273, 276 (N.D. Ca. 2002). \nPage 2 of 5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 64   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/28/2025   Page 3 of 5\nIII.  DISCUSSION \nHaving reviewed Plaintiffs’ requests and Defendant Guthrie’s response, the Court \nfinds  that  several  easily  gathered  documents  can  greatly  improve  the  Court’s \nunderstanding of the issues to be discussed at the August 6, 2025 hearing. Particularly, \nany agreements governing the relationship between state and federal authorities in their \nconstruction and operation of the detention center at TNT would bear heavily on several \nof the core, contested issues that will determine Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the \nmerits. Specifically, the agreements may illuminate whether the project is, at minimum, “a \nFederal and State partnership or joint venture sufficient to trigger NEPA obligations,” (DE \n40 at 4), as Plaintiffs argue, or whether the project “was approved by the State and is \nbeing built [and operated] by the State,” as Defendants respond. (DE 16 at 8). See \nCourthouse News Serv. v. Harris, No. ELH-22-548, 2022 WL 3577255, at *6, (D. Md. \nAug.  18,  2022)  (compelling  “narrowly  tailored”  expedited  discovery  “relevant  to  a \npreliminary injunction determination”); Mullane v. Almon, 339 F.R.D. 659, 663 (N.D. Fla. \n2021) (“Because of the expedited nature of injunctive proceedings, expedited discovery \nis more likely to be appropriate when a plaintiff is seeking a preliminary injunction.”). \nAdditionally, the results of any environmental impact study pertaining to TNT would aid \nthe Court in quantifying the project’s potential environmental harms, which motivate \nPlaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.  \nThe Court is also cognizant of the burden that expedited discovery obligations may \nplace on Defendants as they prepare for a fast-approaching evidentiary hearing in this \ncase. To balance the interests of the Parties, the Court is compelling Defendants to \nproduce only the requested agreements and most recent environmental impact study, \nPage 3 of 5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 64   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/28/2025   Page 4 of 5\nand reserves ruling on Plaintiffs’ remaining discovery requests, including a site visit. \nThese written materials comprise “specific, limited, and identifiable pieces of information,” \nwhich should be readily accessible to Defendants, and without which “the suit cannot \nreasonably proceed[.]” Mullane, 339 F.R.D. at 663.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Expedited Discovery (DE 55) is GRANTED IN PART. \n2.  On or before August 4, 2025, at 5:00 p.m., Defendants shall jointly produce \nthe following to Plaintiffs: \na.   Any agreements between ICE, the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity  (“DHS”),  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency \n(“FEMA”),  or  both,  and  the  FDEM,  or  any  other  state  or  local \ngovernment office, pursuant to section 287(g) or any other provision \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act, applicable to the use of the \nDade-Collier Training and Transition Airport as a detention center. \nb.  A  copy  of  any  Intergovernmental  Service  Agreements  (“IGSA”), \nMemorandum of Understanding, or the like, among FDEM and ICE \nor DHS or FEMA related to the TNT site. \nc.  A copy of any IGSA between ICE and any other state or local \ngovernment office related to the TNT site \nd.

Venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1391(b) & 1391(e)(1)(b) because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaims occurred in this district, and because the TNT Site is owned by defendant Miami-Dade \nCounty, which is located in this district. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff, Friends of the Everglades, Inc., is a Florida non-profit organization with \nmembers and directors in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Its mission includes protecting and \nrestoring the Greater Everglades ecosystem, including the Big Cypress National Preserve and \nEverglades National Park. \n9.  Friends’ members regularly visit and use the Big Cypress National Preserve for \nrecreational, aesthetic, scientific, and spiritual purposes, and intend to continue using the area in \nthis manner, and will suffer irreparable harm if the detention facility is constructed and operated \nat the TNT Site. Friends and its members will suffer procedural harm if the detention center is \nconstructed without compliance with the procedural requirements of NEPA. \n10.  Friends  was founded  in  1969  by  Marjory  Stoneman  Douglas,  a  renowned \njournalist  and  environmental  activist,  to  protect  the  Everglades  from  development  and \ndegradation. In  an  striking  echo,  the  organization’s  founding  focus  was  on  stopping  the \nconstruction of the proposed “Everglades Jetport” at the precise spot where the TNT is located. \nSince that time Friends’ mission has expanded to include preserving, protecting, and restoring \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 4 of 27\nthe entire Everglades ecosystem.  Now, history is repeating itself as Friends once again must act \nto  prevent  destructive  development  in  the  heart  of  the  Everglades  ecosystem  in  the  same \nlocation. Just as Friends did in the 1960s to stop the ill-conceived Jetport, Friends now finds \nitself in a familiar fight—resisting renewed threats to the Everglades posed by the construction of \na mass detention and deportation facility at the TNT Site. \n11.  Ironically, the 1968 proposal to build the “Everglades Jetport”—now the TNT \nSite—contributed to the January 1, 1970 adoption of NEPA, and its requirement to evaluate \nreasonably anticipated environmental impacts that could result from federal action before acting. \nAfter  construction  on  the  Everglades  Jetport  commenced,  and  the  environmental  outcry—\nspearheaded  by  Friends’  founder  Marjory  Stoneman  Douglas—ensued,  the  Department  of \nInterior commissioned a 1969 report led by ecologist Luna Leopold to assess the ecological \nimpacts of the proposal. The report became one of the first de facto environmental impact \nstatements  assessing  impacts  of  federal  action,  and  illustrated  the  utility  of  evaluating \nenvironmental  impacts  before  acting.  Nathaniel  “Nat”  Reed,  who  served  as  then  Florida \nGovernor Claude Kirk’s senior advisor, used the Leopold report to persuade the Governor, who \nhad initially supported the Jetport plan, to reverse course and oppose the project—a position later \nadopted by President Richard Nixon. The Jetport plan was ultimately scuttled, and only the \nrunway—which is expressly limited to use for aviation training—remains. The Nathaniel P. \nReed Visitor Center at Big Cypress National Preserve now sits nearby the TNT Site. \n12.  Friends’ member and Executive Director Eve Samples has personally visited the \nsite and is familiar with the area. Friends’ members enjoy recreating in the Everglades and Big \nCypress  area,  including  in  panther  habitat. They  enjoy  hiking,  camping,  fishing,  kayaking, \ncanoeing, birdwatching, and viewing and photographing nature and wildlife. Since the proposal \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 5 of 27\nto  build  a  mass  detention  facility  in  the  Big  Cypress  National  Preserve  first  surfaced,  an \nastonishing  18,000  supporters  of  Friends  have  voiced  their  opposition  to  the  plan.  This \nopposition springs from a desire to preserve and protect the Everglades, and the Big Cypress \nNational Preserve specifically, among Friends’ members who use, fish, recreate, observe wildlife \nor otherwise enjoy the area. \n13.  Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity (the “Center”) is a national, nonprofit \nconservation organization that works through science, law, and policy to protect all species—\ngreat and small—hovering on the brink of extinction. The Center has offices throughout the \nUnited States, including in Florida, and more than 93,000 active members across the country. \n14.  The  Center’s  members  and  staff  derive  ecological,  recreational,  aesthetic, \neducational,  scientific,  professional,  and  other  benefits  from  visiting  Big  Cypress  National \nPreserve and observing the ecosystems and species who live there. The Center’s members and \nstaff live near or regularly visit Big Cypress National Preserve and the Greater Everglades \nEcosystem. \n15.  For  example,  one  Center  member,  Tierra  Curry,  is  a  scientist  committed  to \nprotecting intact ecosystems and preventing biodiversity loss. She plans to visit Big Cypress \nNational Preserve this fall 2025 to hike, paddle, and observe wildlife. Another Center member, \nAmber Crooks is a conservationist who regularly visits Big Cypress National Preserve to enjoy \nthe quiet peace of nature, to observe wildlife like red-cockaded woodpecker, and to appreciate \nremarkably dark night skies—among the darkest east of the Mississippi. \n16.  Friends  of  the  Everglades’  and  the  Center’s  members  are  being  injured  by \nDefendants’ unlawful actions, which threaten the integrity of Big Cypress National Preserve’s \nwaters and pristine night skies, the wellbeing of the plants and wildlife living there, and thus the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 6 of 27\nPlaintiffs’ interests in them. Friends and the Center are also injured by being deprived of critical \ninformation and a public process to analyze and address significant environmental impacts \nassociated with the detention center.  NEPA is a procedural statute and “[w]hen a litigant is \nvested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some possibility that the \nrequested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly \nharmed the litigant.” Okeelanta Corp. v. United States Army Corps of Eng'rs, 132 F.4th 1320, \n1332 (11th Cir. 2025) (quoting Massachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 517 (2007)). \n17.  The injuries described are actual, concrete injuries presently suffered by Plaintiffs \nand their members, and they will continue to occur unless this Court grants immediate relief. The \nrelief sought herein would redress those harms. Plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy at law. \n18.  Defendant Kevin Guthrie is the Executive Director of the Florida Division of \nEmergency Management and is sued solely in his official capacity. \n19.  Defendants Secretary Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the \nUnited States Department of Homeland Security (“USDHS”), and Director Todd Lyons, in his \nofficial capacity as Director of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) \nagency, are federal officials responsible for immigration enforcement and detention and have \nauthority over the arrangements for the use of the TNT Site as a mass detention center. \n20.  Defendant  Miami-Dade  County  (the  “County”)  owns  the  TNT  Site  and,  on \ninformation and belief, has acquiesced in the other Defendants transformation of the TNT Site \ninto a mass detention center even though County rules do not permit use of the TNT Site for this \npurpose. \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 7 of 27\nCOMMON ALLEGATIONS \n21.  The Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport is a publicly owned airfield \nlocated within environmentally sensitive lands at the border of Miami-Dade and Collier counties, \nwithin the Big Cypress National Preserve, and within the Big Cypress Area as defined in Fla. \nStat. § 380.055. At over 17,000 acres, the TNT Site is the largest parcel of land within the Big \nCypress National Preserve not owned by the federal government. \n22.  The  Big  Cypress  National  Preserve  was  established  in  1974,  and  has  been \nexpanded since its creation. see Big Cypress National Preserve Act, Pub. L. No. 93-440, as \namended by Pub. L. No. 100-301 (the Big Cypress National Preserve Addition Act of 1988); 16 \nU.S.C. § 698f.  The Preserve was created “in order to assure the preservation, conservation and \nprotection of the natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral and faunal and recreational values in the Big \nCypress Watershed.” Pub. L. No. 93-440(a). The Preserve is managed as a unit of the National \nPark System “in a manner which will assure their natural and ecological integrity in perpetuity’ \nin accordance with the provisions of this Act and with the provisions of the Act of August 25, \n1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4), as amended and supplemented.” Pub. L. No. 100-301 § 4(a), \nBig Cypress National Preserve Addition Act of 1988.   \n23.  The Big Cypress National Preserve area where the TNT Site is located is known \nfor its wetlands, critical wildlife habitat, and protected species, including the threatened wood \nstork, and endangered Florida bonneted bat and the Florida panther. The Site is within an \nenvironmentally sensitive freshwater wetland ecosystem of ecological significance for wildlife \nhabitat. The Site is important for drinking water supply and Everglades water quality.  \n24.  The Big Cypress Preserve is home to various listed threatened or endangered \nspecies including the Florida bonneted bat, the Florida panthers, wood stork, Everglade snail \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 8 of 27\nkite,  and  others,  as  documented  in  the  Big  Cypress  National  Preserve  website.  See, \nhttps://www.nps.gov/bicy/learn/nature/animals.htm, last visited June 25, 2025.  Florida panthers \nhave been geolocated on the TNT Site on many occasions. The map below shows Florida \npanthers geolocated on the TNT Site: \n \n25.  Florida bonneted bats have also been documented in the Big Cypress National \nPreserve. See 78 Fed. Reg. 61004, 61008, 61011 (Oct. 2, 2013). \n26.  In the Big Cypress Conservation Act of 1973, Fla. Stat. § 380.055, the Florida \nLegislature determined that “the Big Cypress Area is an area containing and having a significant \nimpact upon environmental and natural resources of regional and statewide importance and that \ndesignation  of  the  area  as  an  area  of  critical  state  concern  is  desirable  and  necessary  to \naccomplish the purposes of ‘The Florida Environmental Land and Water Management Act of \n1972’ and to implement s. 7, Art. II of the State Constitution.” Fla. Stat. § 380.055(2). \n27.  The TNT Site is within the Big Cypress National Preserve as illustrated below: \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 9 of 27\n \n \n28.  The TNT Site’s location within the Big Cypress National Preserve is further \nillustrated by the below GIS map: \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 10 of 27\n \n29.  The TNT Site is also proximate to Everglades National Park, and part of the \nhistoric  Everglades.  Since  the  passage  of  the  Comprehensive  Everglades  Restoration  Plan \n(“CERP”) in 2000, the federal government and the State of Florida have jointly committed to one \nof the most ambitious ecosystem restoration efforts in the world. Authorized by Section 601 of \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000), Pub. L. No. 106-541, 114 Stat. \n2572, CERP provides a framework for restoring, preserving, and protecting the South Florida \necosystem, including the Everglades, over multiple decades. The Plan encompasses more than 60 \nprojects designed to improve water quality, restore hydrologic flow, and protect critical habitat. \n30.  Under  CERP,  the  federal  government,  through  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  and \nEngineers  (“USACE”)  and  the  Department  of  the  Interior  (“DOI”),  fund  half  the  costs  of \nrestoration. The State of Florida contributes the other half, with each partner committing billions \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 11 of 27\nof dollars to implementation. As of 2024, total appropriations for Everglades restoration from \nboth federal and state sources exceed $20 billion—much of which has been allocated since \n2019—reflecting a sustained, bipartisan commitment to safeguarding the ecological integrity of \nthe Everglades and adjacent areas like Big Cypress National Preserve.  \n31.  These investments are reinforced by successive authorizations and appropriations \nthrough subsequent federal legislation, including the Water Resources Development Acts of \n2007, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024 each of which reauthorized and expanded CERP \ncomponents.  The  State  of  Florida  has  likewise  demonstrated  its  ongoing  commitment  to \nEverglades restoration through substantial state funding, including over $3.5 billion committed \nbetween 2019 and 2024 alone under Florida’s “Everglades Restoration Strategy.” These efforts \nsupport not only environmental protection, but also flood control, drinking water supply, and \nbiodiversity, and endangered species habitat preservation and conservation across South Florida.  \n32.  One  recent  component  of  CERP is  the  Western  Everglades  Restoration  Plan \n(“WERP”), which will use a series of active and passive water management features, water \nquality features, and alterations to existing canals and levees with a goal of improving the \nquantity, quality, timing and distribution of water in the Western Everglades in the effort to re-\nestablish ecological connectivity, reduce the severity and frequency of wildfires, and restore low \nnutrient conditions.  The TNT sits within the WERP footprint as illustrated below: \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 12 of 27\n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 13 of 27\n33.  The Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport site, which is within and/or \nborders  the  Big  Cypress  National  Preserve,  lies  within  the  broader  Everglades  ecosystem \nrestoration footprint, and any development at that site that disrupts hydrologic connectivity or \ndegrades environmental conditions threatens to undermine the very objectives that these federal \nand state investments were intended to achieve. \n34.  The Division has recently entered into an arrangement with DHS to allow the use \nof the TNT Site as a mass detention facility for ICE.  DHS has advised that it intends to detain up \nto 5,000  for federal immigration purposes. In a statement, DHS advised that Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (“FEMA”) shelter program funds would be used to pay the Division \napproximately $450 million a year to operate the detention centers, which the Division has \ndubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” \n35.  During a press conference on June 25, 2025, Governor DeSantis noted that federal \nagencies would fully fund the detention center, stating: “This is fully funded by the federal \ngovernment”; “This is something that was requested by the federal government, and this is \nsomething  that  the  federal  government  is  going  to  fully  fund”;  “From  a  state  taxpayer \nperspective,  we  are  implementing  it  ...  but  that  will  be  fully  reimbursed  by  the  federal \ngovernment.”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJfG7L9reHU&ab_channel=FOX35Orlando, \n(at 6:01 timemark), last visited June 27, 2025. \n36.  As these public statements confirm, the Division is acting as the agent of federal \nimmigration enforcement agencies in transporting and detaining noncitizens to the TNT Site, and \nfacilitating the deportation of noncitizens from the Site. \n37.  In correspondence with Miami-Dade County, Mr. Guthrie stated that the Division \nintends to use the Site “to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement.” Florida \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 14 of 27\nAttorney General James Uthemeier has been quoted that the TNT Site, with its runway, is \nintended to be used to “detain, deport and get people out of this country.” In correspondence to \nthe County, Division Executive Director Guthrie states that the Division, “has identified the \n[Site] as a critical asset for ongoing and future emergency response, aviation logistics, and \nstaging operations,” suggesting that the TNT Site will be used for deportation flights. \n38.  The  planned  use  of  the  TNT  Site  includes  the  installation  of  prefabricated \nhousing, water and sewage infrastructure, security fencing, high-intensity security lighting, and \nother structures. In addition, numerous fill laden dump trucks have been observed entering the \nSite. As noted, the Division has also expressed a desire to utilize the runway in connection with \nreceiving and deporting detainees from the Site. \n39.  Construction on the detention center has unfolded at a breakneck pace, and is \nongoing. The Division took control of the Site only on June 23, 2025. Since then kitchen \nfacilities, restrooms, housing facilities, portable industrial lighting, and other infrastructure have \nbeen positioned on site, and heavy vehicular traffic on and out of the site has been observed, and \nis ongoing. A steady stream of fill-laden dump trucks have been observed entering and exiting \nthe Site in recent days. State officials have publicly stated that they expect to begin housing \ndetainees at the TNT Site by July 1, 2025.  \n40.  The photo below shows dump trucks with covered cargo entering the TNT Site \nearlier this week: \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 15 of 27\n  \n41.  Below is an image published in the Miami Herald and taken on or about June 24, \n2025, of industrial, high intensity lighting units being delivered to the TNT site: \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 16 of 27\n42.  Below are images of portable generators, also published in the Miami Herald, \ndepicting industrial generators being delivered to the site: \n \n43.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, no environmental assessment or environmental impact \nstatement has been prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ \n4321, et seq., nor has the Division conducted any environmental review under Florida law. \n44.  Defendant Miami-Dade County, while unlawfully allowing its TNT Site to be \noccupied by agencies seeking to enforce federal immigration laws, has questioned the lack of \nany environmental analyses regarding the project. On June 23, 2025, Miami-Dade County Mayor \nDaniella Levine Cava wrote to the Division and stated: “With the federal and state government \ninvesting well over $10 billion since 2019 in Everglades restoration and protection, we would \nappreciate  a  detailed  analysis  and  report  on  environmental  impacts  of  this  facility  to  the \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 17 of 27\nEverglades.  We  would  also  value  input  from  the  appropriate  federal  agencies  on  their \nenvironmental reviews and analyses prior to proceeding.” \n45.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, Defendants have not conferred with the USACE, DOI, \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or any other federal or local agency regarding potential impacts \nfrom the construction of a detention center for 5,000 individuals at the TNT Site. \n46.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, no categorical exclusion from NEPA has been invoked \nby the Defendants, nor does any apply. \n47.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, no exemption or waiver of NEPA requirements has \nbeen invoked by Defendants, and none exist. \n48.  There is no emergency that would warrant departure from NEPA’s requirements, \nas NEPA contains no exception for emergencies. Even if an emergency existed, none of the \nDefendants have made alternative arrangements as was required under NEPA regulations, which, \nin any event, have recently been withdrawn. \n49.  No public notice or hearing has been conducted in connection with the use of the \nTNT Site for migrant detention. \n50.  The property is subject to intergovernmental agreements and historical land use \nrestrictions related to its location within the footprint of the Big Cypress National Preserve and \nState Big Cypress Area. \n51.  The hasty transformation of the Site into a mass detention facility, which includes \nthe installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services systems, industrial \nhigh-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering \nthe natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of \nthe runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts. The Defendants, \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 18 of 27\nin their rush to build the center, have unlawfully bypassed the required environmental reviews. \nThe direct and indirect harm to nearby wetlands, wildlife, and air and water quality, and feasible \nalternatives to the action, must be considered under NEPA before acting. \n52.  The TNT Site is highly susceptible to flooding and no feasible plan has been \nstudied to evacuate center detainees and personnel in the event of a hurricane or major flooding \nevent.  \n53.  DHS also violated the Endangered Species Act by, among other things, failing to \nconsult with USFWS.  Plaintiffs intend to amend this Complaint to add the ESA claims after the \nrequired 60-day pre-suit notice, 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2)(A)(i), period has expired. \n54.  Additionally,  to  Plaintiffs’  knowledge,  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  acting \nthrough the Director of the National Park Service, has taken no action to regulate the use of the \nBig Cypress National Preserve in such manner and by such means that will leave the Preserve \nunimpaired by the environmental impacts of the TNT Site and associated operations.   \n55.  The National Park Service Organic Act of 1916, (16 U.S.C. § 1, amended and \nrecodified in 54 U.S.C. § 100101(a) (2014)), states, “The Secretary, acting through the Director \nof the National Park Service, shall promote and regulate the use of the National Park System by \nmeans  and  measures  that  conform  to  the  fundamental  purpose  of  the  System  units,  which \npurpose is to conserve the scenery, natural and historic objects, and wild life in the System units \nand to provide for the enjoyment of the scenery, natural and historic objects, and wild life in such \nmanner  and  by  such  means  as  will  leave  them  unimpaired  for  the  enjoyment  of  future \ngenerations.” \n56.  This  “non-impairment”  mandate  was  reaffirmed  by  Congress  in  the  1978 \namendments to the Act. The 1978 Reaffirmation states: “Congress reaffirms, declares, and \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 19 of 27\ndirects that the promotion and regulation of the various System units shall be consistent with and \nfounded in the purpose by subsection (a), to the common benefit of all the people of the United \nStates.  The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and \nadministration of the System units shall be conducted in light of the high public value and \nintegrity of the System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for \nwhich the System units have been established, except as directly and specifically provided by \nCongress.”  54 U.S.C. § 100101(b). \n57.  The Big Cypress National Preserve was established to “assure the preservation, \nconservation,  and  protection  of  the  natural,  scenic,  hydrologic,  floral,  and  faunal,  and \nrecreational values of the Big Cypress Watershed in the State of Florida and to provide for the \nenhancement and public enjoyment thereof.” Pub. L. No. 93-440(a). \n58.  The TNT facility and associated operations will use and impair the Big Cypress \nNational Preserve by causing direct and indirect harm to its wetlands, wildlife, and air and water \nquality. These impacts will result in the degradation of the natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral, and \nfaunal, and recreational values for which the Preserve was created.  \n59.  The  Secretary  of  the  Interior  and  the  National  Park  Service’s  apparent \nacquiescence in DHS and ICE’s funding and operating the TNT facility in a manner that will \nresult in significant environmental harm to the Preserve, does not comport with the Act’s non-\nimpairment mandate, is in derogation of the values and purposes for which the Preserve was \nestablished, and is not otherwise directly and specifically allowed by Congress. Plaintiffs reserve \nthe right to amend this Complaint to add the Secretary of Interior. \n60.  All conditions precedent to the maintenance of this action have occurred, been \nwaived, or both. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 20 of 27\nCOUNT I \n(VIOLATION OF NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA)) \n(Against the DIVISION, DHS and ICE) \n \n61.  Plaintiffs reallege the Common Allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n62.  The  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA),  42  U.S.C.  §  4321  et  seq., \nrequires federal agencies to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for any major \nfederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, or an Environmental \nAssessment (EA) if the agency action does not have reasonably foreseeable significant effects on \nthe human environment, or if the significance of such effect is unknown. \n63.  Major federal actions include any action that is subject to “substantial Federal \ncontrol and responsibility.” 42 U.S.C. § 4336e(10). \n64.  The  construction  of  an  immigration  detention  center  is  an  action  that  is \nnecessarily subject to federal control and responsibility. The State of Florida has no authority or \njurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 \n(2012)  (holding  federal  law  preempts  state  immigration  law  enforcement).  In  Arizona,  the \nSupreme Court reaffirmed “the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of \nthe Federal Government.” Id. at 409. The Court explained that “decision[s] on removability [of \nnoncitizens] requires a determination whether it is appropriate to allow a foreign national to \ncontinue living in the United States. Decisions of this nature touch on foreign relations and must \nbe made with one voice.” Id. (quoting Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (“Policies \npertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here are ... entrusted exclusively to \nCongress ...”)).  \n65.  In Fla. Stat. § 908.13, the Florida legislature authorized the Division to facilitate \nthe transport of detainees on the condition that ICE “specifically request assistance from the \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 21 of 27\ndivision with the transport of unauthorized aliens pursuant to specific federal legal authority.” Id. \n§ 908.13(2)(a). Additionally, ICE “must reimburse the state for the actual cost of assisting with \nthe transport of unauthorized aliens.” Id. § 908.13(2)(b). Any such transport “must occur under \nthe direct control and supervision of” ICE. Id. § 908.13(2)(c) (emphasis added). Because state \nlaw requires that the Division’s transportation of detainees to and from the detention center occur \nunder the “direct control and supervision” of ICE, the TNT detention center project is statutorily \nrequired  to  be  under  “Federal  control  and  responsibility,”  42  U.S.C.  §  4336e(10),  thereby \ntriggering NEPA. In this way, the Division is acting as agent for DHS and ICE.  \n66.  Florida Attorney General Uthmeier has announced that the TNT Site will be used \n“in support of the Trump administration” in federal immigration law enforcement. The Attorney \nGeneral has posted on social media that “Alligator Alcatraz [is] the one-stop shop to carry out \nPresident Trump’s mass deportation agenda.” He accompanied the post with a video of the TNT \nSite runway. Governor DeSantis has been quoted as stating the TNT Site is to “facilitate the \nfederal government in immigration enforcement.” \n67.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 4336e(10), Congress identified non-major federal actions as \nactions conducted with “no or minimal Federal funding.” Conversely, infrastructure projects like \nthis one that are funded and/or approved by the Federal government, require federal agencies to \nprepare an EIS for actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment or an \nEA if the agency action does not have reasonably foreseeable significant effect on the human \nenvironment or if the significance of such effect is unknown. The evaluation must address the \nsignificant environmental effects of a proposed project and identify feasible alternatives that \ncould mitigate those effects. NEPA is a procedural statute that requires federal agencies to \nprepare an environmental impact statement, or EIS, identifying significant environmental effects \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 22 of 27\nof the projects, as well as feasible alternatives. The law ensures that the agency and the public \nare aware of the environmental consequences of proposed projects. Properly applied, NEPA \nhelps agencies to make better decisions and to ensure good project management.  \n68.  Specifically, an EIS must include a “detailed statement” addressing the following: \n(i)  reasonably  foreseeable  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  agency  action;  (ii)  any \nreasonably  foreseeable  adverse  environmental  effects  which  cannot  be  avoided  should  the \nproposal be implemented; (iii) a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed agency action, \nincluding an analysis of any negative environmental impacts of not implementing the proposed \nagency action in the case of a no action alternative, that are technically and economically \nfeasible, and meet the purpose and need of the proposal; (iv) the relationship between local short-\nterm  uses  of  man's  environment  and  the  maintenance  and  enhancement  of  long-term \nproductivity; and (v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of Federal resources which \nwould be involved in the proposed agency action should it be implemented. 42 U.S.C. §§ \n4332(C)((i)-(v). \n69.  Moreover, NEPA requires that “[p]rior to making any detailed statement,” the \nhead of the lead agency “shall consult with and obtain the comments of any Federal agency \nwhich has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact \ninvolved.”  Id. § 4332(C). Because actions associated with the construction and operation of the \ndetention center at the TNT Site are within a national preserve that includes primary habitat for \nthe Florida panther and critical habitat for the Florida bonneted bat, at a bare minimum federal \nlaw requires USDHS to consult with the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService in assessing the environmental impacts of its proposed project. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 23 of 27\n70.  NEPA contains no exceptions for emergency actions, and no emergency exists. \nNEPA regulations provided that in cases of emergencies such as a hurricane, flood or wildfire, a \nfederal  agency  should  consult  with  the  Council  about  alternative  arrangements.  These \narrangements must be limited to actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the \nemergency.” 40 C.F.R. § 1506.12. These regulations, however, have been withdrawn. In any \nevent, there is no emergency and, even if there was, no alternative arrangements have been \nimplemented. \n71.  The arrangements between the Division, USDHS and ICE to transform the TNT \nSite into a mass detention and deportation facility constitute major federal action, as it involves \nthe  use  of  federal  authority,  approvals,  funding  and  resources,  and  will  have  significant \nenvironmental impacts on an ecologically sensitive area. Those impacts, which to date have gone \nunevaluated, could logically include impacts to listed species, impacts to wetlands and surface \nwaters, impacts due to increased activities at the Site, including traffic to and from the Site, \nhurricane and flooding preparedness, etc.  \n72.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, no EA or EIS has been prepared by DHS, ICE, the \nDivision, or any cooperating agency. \n73.  The failure to conduct the required environmental review under NEPA violates \nfederal law and deprives the public and affected stakeholders, including Plaintiffs, of required \nprocedures and procedural environmental protections. \n74.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief requiring compliance \nwith NEPA before any further activity occurs at the TNT Site. \n \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 24 of 27\nCOUNT II \n(VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (APA) \n(Against DHS and ICE)) \n \n75.  Plaintiffs reallege the Common Allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n76.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., permits judicial \nreview of final agency actions that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law. \n77.  USDHS and ICE have approved or are implementing the use of the TNT Site \nwithout providing Plaintiffs and the public with an opportunity for notice and comment, and \nwithout adhering to required environmental review procedures under NEPA and other federal \nlaws, including the Endangered Species Act, and the National Park Service Organic Act of 1916, \n(16 U.S.C. § 1, amended and recodified in 54 U.S.C. § 100101(a) (2014)). \n78.  The decision to proceed without notice, comment and without an EA or EIS \nconstitutes final agency action and is subject to judicial review. \n79.  Plaintiffs are  entitled to a declaration that the  agency’s conduct is unlawful, \ndirecting vacatur of the agency action, as well as an injunction preventing further activity until \nNEPA compliance is achieved. \nCOUNT III \n(ULTRA VIRES ACTION (Against the Division)) \n \n80.  Plaintiffs reallege the Common Allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n81.  The Division of Emergency Management is governed by Chapter 252, Florida \nStatutes. \n82.  Nothing in Chapter 252 authorizes the Division to convert county-owned property \ninto a federal detention center without legislative authority, environmental review, or compliance \nwith local land use requirements. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 25 of 27\n83.  Moreover, Florida law requires that, before the State of Florida may construct a \ncorrectional facility, it must consult with local governments with jurisdiction over the proposed \nsite to determine if the proposed facility would comply with applicable local land use laws.  Fla. \nStat. § 944.095(2). Florida law further provides that local governments have 90 days to review \nany proposed correctional facility to determine if it complies with the applicable land use laws.  \nThe Division has not complied with these legal requirements. \n84.  The Division has no independent legislative authority to construct and manage a \ncorrectional facility.  Under Florida law, a correctional facility means any “prison, road camp … \nprison forestry camp … prison farm [whether] temporary or permanent.” Section 944.02(8), Fla. \nStat. “Prisoner” includes any person “under civil or criminal arrest [and committed] to the \ncustody of the department pursuant to lawful authority.” Id. § 944.02(6). These provisions apply \nto the Florida Department of Corrections, however, not the Division which has no authority to \ndetain persons under Florida law. \n85.  Defendant’s actions exceed the scope of authority granted by Florida law. \n86.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  declaratory  relief  under  28  U.S.C.  §  2201  that  the \nDivision’s arrangement with DHS is ultra vires and void, and the construction of the TNT Site \ndetention center is being conducted in derogation of state law. \n87.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to injunctive relief preventing further construction or \noperation at the site. \nCOUNT IV \n(Violation of Miami-Dade County Code and CDMP (against Miami-Dade County)) \n \n88.  Plaintiffs reallege the Common Allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n89.  Pursuant  to  the  County’s  Operational  Directive  No.  15-02,  the  TNT  Site  is \ngoverned by Chapter 25 of the Miami-Dade County Code, pertaining to aviation operations.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 26 of 27\n90.  The TNT Site is permitted only for aviation uses including pilot flight training, \npilot proficiency checks, and aircraft maintenance flight checks. \n91.  In addition, the Site, or a portion of it, is designated Environmentally Protected \nParks  under  Miami-Dade  Counties  Comprehensive  Development  Master  Plan  due  to  its \nenvironmental sensitivity. \n92.  The Site is not permitted or authorized for use for non-flight purposes. \n93.  The County’s agreement or acquiescence in allowing the TNT Site for use as a \nmas detention center is in violation of the County code and permitting regimes. \n94.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 that the County may \nnot authorize or allow use of the TNT Site for purposes other than that allowed under the County \nCode and existing permits and authorizations. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Friends of the Everglades respectfully requests that the Court: \n \nA.  Declare that Defendants’ actions violate NEPA and the APA; \n \nB.  Enjoin any further pre-construction activities, construction, conversion, or use of \nthe TNT Site for purposes of immigration detention unless and until Defendants comply with \nNEPA and the APA; \n \nC.  Declare that Defendant Guthrie’s actions exceed lawful authority under Florida \nlaw and violate state environmental and land use laws; \n \nD.  Enjoin Defendant Guthrie from authorizing or permitting further development or \nuse of the TNT Site for purposes related to a mass detention center; \n \nE.  Enjoin  the  County  from  permitting  the  use  of  property  limited  to  aviation \nactivities as a mass detainment center. \n \nF.  Award Plaintiffs their attorneys’ fees and costs as allowed by law; \n \nG.  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 27 of 27\nDated:   June 27, 2025 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nEARTHJUSTICE  COFFEY BURLINGTON, P.L. \n4500 Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 201  2601 South Bayshore Drive, Penthouse One \nMiami, Florida  33137  Miami, Florida  33133 \nTelephone:  (305) 440-5432  Telephone:  (305) 858-2900 \n   \nBy:      s/    Tania Galloni        By:      s/    Paul J.

The district court entered a preliminary \ninjunction ordering Florida and the United States to dismantle the facility within 60 \ndays because the federal government allegedly failed to prepare an environmental \nreport under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). But NEPA does not \napply to Florida, and Plaintiffs have identified no federal action, much less a “major \nfederal action,” that might trigger NEPA. Nor have Plaintiffs identified “final agency \naction” for purposes of a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). \nJust months ago, the Supreme Court ordered a “course correction” to bring \nNEPA review “back in line with the statutory text and common sense.” Seven County \nInfrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1514 (2025). “Congress \ndid not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new infrastructure and construction \nprojects.” Id. Because NEPA is a “purely procedural” statute, courts must not vacate \nor enjoin agency action based on a mere NEPA deficiency without reason to believe \nthe agency would have disapproved the project with more environmental review. Id. \nHere, such a conclusion does not pass muster: The district court did not and could \nnot conclude that President Trump’s administration would have decided not to \nconstruct this high-profile immigration-detention facility if only it had received further \n1 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 7 of 226 \n \nbriefing on the marginal effects of the facility’s lights on the survival rate of the \nFlorida panther in 2070. \nMoreover, NEPA requires only that a federal agency analyze its own proposed \naction. Seven County, 145 S. Ct. at 1515. But here, no federal action requiring NEPA \nanalysis has been undertaken. Even if this Court assumes that the relevant major \nfederal action is a future decision to reimburse Florida for the facility’s costs, that \nwould not require the agency to consider the effects of building the facility because \nthe construction was outside the agency’s control—and happened in the past. Id. at \n1515-18. It is therefore the paradigm of a project “separate in time.” Id. at 1517. \nIn addition to the merits, the district court erred in finding irreparable harm \nand in balancing the equities. This site was already an active airport. Plaintiffs failed to \nestablish that Florida’s changes to the site are causing imminent irreparable injury and \nthat any such injury outweighs Florida’s interest in operating the facility and relieving \novercrowding at other facilities.   \nAt bottom, this case “is a testament to environmental review run amok.” \nAppalachian Voices v. FERC, 139 F.4th 903, 919 (D.C. Cir. 2025) (Henderson, J., \nconcurring). This Court should reject Plaintiffs’ invitation to second-guess state \ngovernment, conflate it with federal agencies, and enjoin this important facility under \na purely procedure statute. The Court should grant a motion to stay.   \n2 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 8 of 226 \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) has constructed a \ntemporary detention facility for illegal aliens at the Dade-Collier Training and \nTransition Airport, a state-owned airfield. App.40, 43, 46. The facility opened on July \n1, 2025, with the first group of detainees arriving two days later. Florida used state \nfunds to build the facility. Federal officials did not order the state to construct the \nfacility. App.46, 91. Nor did Florida seek federal permission to build it. Id.  \nState officials are detaining illegal aliens at the facility “under the authority \ndelegated pursuant to section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), at \n8 U.S.C. § 1357(g).” App.34. Section 287(g) authorizes the U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS) to enter into agreements with state and local law \nenforcement agencies to delegate authority to carry out immigration functions under \nfederal law. 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1). As such, “[t]he ultimate decision of who to detain at \nthe [facility] belongs to Florida.” App.34. Florida is solely responsible for funding, \nconstructing, and operating this facility. App.29, 46-47, 91. Florida is seeking federal \ngrant money to reimburse the state for some portion of the costs, but the federal \ndefendants have made no decision to award funding. App.34, 46. \nPlaintiffs filed a complaint in the Southern District of Florida seeking to declare \nthe facility unlawful and to enjoin its construction and use. App.26. The complaint \nalleges violations of NEPA, the APA, and “provisions of Florida law.” App.1.  \n3 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 9 of 226 \n \nBecause the facility is in the Middle District of Florida and all the detention, \nconstruction, and decision-making that Plaintiffs challenge occurred outside the \nSouthern District, the state and federal defendants moved to transfer venue to the \nMiddle District. ECF 50; ECF 60. But rather than resolving the venue question first, \nthe district court rushed ahead to temporarily enjoin the state’s construction activities \nfor 14 days, while it heard testimony and argument on Plaintiffs’ preliminary \ninjunction motion. ECF 104.  \nThe district court then issued a preliminary injunction, indefinitely enjoining \nthe state’s construction activities at the site until the federal defendants fulfill NEPA’s \nprocedural requirements. App.188. It also prohibited holding new detainees at the \nfacility and required the removal of fencing, lighting, generators and gas, sewage and \nwaste receptacles within 60 days. App.189. In so doing, the district court identified no \naffirmative federal action taken by the federal defendants that might be subject to \nNEPA and reviewable under the APA. The court instead concluded that the \nreviewable final agency action under the APA was a failure to act since, in its view, the \nlack of an EIS or environmental assessment (EA) qualifies as final agency action. \nApp.158-61. And although the facility is state owned and operated, the court \nconcluded that NEPA applied to the facility’s construction and operation because the \nfederal government supposedly has decided to fund the facility and allegedly controls \nfederally-deputized state officers under 287(g) agreements with the state. App.163-75.  \n4 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 10 of 226 \n \nThe district court rejected the defendants’ venue challenge, concluding that the \nstate defendants had waived it by not raising their objections in their responses to \nemergency motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. \nApp.130-32. The district court nevertheless concluded that venue in the Southern \nDistrict was proper. App.132-52.  \nThe district court further concluded that the INA did not prohibit the ordered \nrelief, App.125-29, that Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary injunctive relief, App.175-83, and that the balance of harms and public \ninterest supported an injunction, App.183-88. \nThe court required Plaintiff to post a $100 bond under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), \nbut made no findings that such amount was sufficient to pay the costs to the \ndefendants of an unlawful injunction. Id. at 81. The federal defendants moved for a \nstay pending appeal. App.107-08; ECF 138. The district court did not act on it in time.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA party is entitled to a stay if it shows (1) it will likely succeed on the merits; (2) \nit will suffer irreparable injury absent a stay; (3) the stay will not substantially injure the \nother interested parties; and (4) a stay is in the public interest. New Georgia Project v. \nRaffensperger, 976 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir. 2020) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n434 (2009)).  \n5 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 11 of 226 \n \nARGUMENT \n  The Court should stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal for the \nreasons expressed by the state defendants in their motion and for the reasons below. \nI.  The federal defendants are likely to succeed on appeal.  \nIn its haste to stop activities at the temporary detention center, the district \ncourt committed numerous errors of law. It disregarded the improper venue. It \nidentified no major federal action subject to NEPA, 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C), and no final \nagency action for APA review, 5 U.S.C. § 704. It usurped the agencies’ discretion on \nwhen to conduct a NEPA analysis as to the future federal actions that may yet happen \nregarding this facility. It failed to justify, as it must under recent Supreme Court \nprecedent, why a putative violation of NEPA justifies enjoining construction and \noperation in the absence of any substantive violation of law. And it erred by enjoining \nthe state’s construction activities at, and operation of, the facility without a showing of \nlikely irreparable harm to Plaintiffs.   \nA.  Venue does not belong in the Southern District of Florida.  \nThe Southern District of Florida is an improper venue for this suit for the \nreasons explained by the state defendants at 14-23. The district court also erred in \nconcluding that venue is proper in the Southern District in part because a plaintiff \nresides there and a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States. App.132-\n36. Venue is proper under that theory only “if no real property is involved in the \naction.” 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C). Because Plaintiffs request an injunction controlling \n6 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 12 of 226 \n \nthe use to which the land can be put, venue lies only in the Middle District where the \nunderlying land sits.  \nB.  There is no reviewable final or major federal action at issue.  \nPlaintiffs lack a valid cause of action. Because NEPA does not provide a \nprivate cause of action, NEPA claims must be brought challenging “final agency \naction” under the APA. Ctr. for a Sustainable Coast v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 100 \nF.4th 1349, 1355 n.2 (11th Cir. 2024); Karst Env’t Educ. & Prot., Inc. v. EPA, 475 F.3d \n1291, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The APA defines “agency” as certain authorities of the \nfederal government. See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). And the APA defines “agency action” as an \n“agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or \nfailure to act.” Id. § 551(13). But Plaintiffs have not challenged any discrete, \naffirmative federal action, so the district court concluded that the reviewable action is a \n“failure to act.” App.158. In the district court’s view, the lack of an EA or EIS \nqualifies as final agency action. App.158-61. This view is dead wrong.  \n “NEPA claims must … allege final agency action” separate from the \n“decision” to conduct NEPA review. Karst, 475 F.3d at 1297. As Seven County \nreiterates, courts “must keep in mind that review of an agency’s EIS is not the same \nthing as review of the agency’s final decision concerning the project.” 145 S. Ct. at \n1511. The district court takes advantage of some imprecise snippets in the caselaw, \nApp.158, but each case was a challenge to a separate final agency action. Because there \n7 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 13 of 226 \n \nis no reviewable final agency action presently before the federal courts, Plaintiffs \ncannot succeed on the merits of their NEPA claims.  \nMoreover, NEPA applies only to proposals for major federal action. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 4332(C). Plaintiffs simply fail to identify any major federal action regarding \nconstruction, operation, or funding of the detention center, let alone a final one. The \nfederal defendants have not implemented, directed, or controlled the construction \nwork. App.34. As the state defendants demonstrate at 25-37, there is insufficient \nfederal control over the day-to-day operations of the detention facility to make its \nconstruction and operation a major federal action subject to NEPA or reviewable \nunder the APA. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1572. Mere federal influence or \ninvolvement is insufficient—there must be actual control over the non-federal \nactivities. Id. But the federal government cannot control the size of the detention \nfacility, how many beds it has, who it must house, when it will be built, who will build \nit, or what materials will be used. \nThe federal defendants also have sent no funds to Florida in connection with \nthe temporary detention center. App.34-35, 38. While the state has expressed an \ninterest in federal funding and federal officials have expressed an openness to funding \nrequests from the state, the “possibility that federal funding will be provided in the \nfuture is not sufficient to federalize a state project, even when such funding is likely.” \nS. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1573.  \n8 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 14 of 226 \n \nContrary to the district court’s assumption (App.171), no final federal funding \ndecisions have been made. Federal officials still must decide on the source, timing, \namount, purpose and limitations of such funding before any funding decisions \nbecome final. And the federal defendants fully intend to comply with NEPA before \ntaking any final agency action to grant federal funding. See Rattlesnake Coal. v. EPA, \n509 F.3d 1095, 1103 (9th Cir. 2007) (there is no final agency action on a NEPA claim \nuntil the agency decides to disburse funds, even where the funds have been earmarked \nfor a specific purpose by Congress).1 \nThe district court concluded that there is a final and major federal action here \nbecause state officials are acting under the color of federal law pursuant to the 287(g) \nagreements. App.163. This has several problems. At the outset, even if brought by a \nnon-party to an agreement, decisions to enter contracts, such as a 287(g) agreement, \nare not reviewable in a federal district court under the APA. See Albrecht v. Committee on \nEmp. Benefits of the Fed. Resv., 357 F.3d 62-67-68 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  \nMoreover, the decision to enter 287(g) agreements is not reviewable by federal \ncourts under a jurisdiction-stripping provision for discretionary immigration activities. \nWhile Section 287(g) agreements include certain legal requirements, the decision to \nenter into one is discretionary. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1) (Secretary “may enter into a \n \n1 Compliance with NEPA does not necessarily mean issuing an EIS, and the \ngovernment notes that any funding decision would be a “separate project” from the \ndecision to build the facility. Seven County, 145 S. Ct. at 1518. \n9 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 15 of 226 \n \nwritten agreement”); Bouarfa v. Mayorkas, 604 U.S. 6, 13 (2024) (limitation applies to \nstatute that provides Secretary “may . . . revoke the approval of any [visa] petition”).2 \nIn turn, Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the INA states that “no court shall have \njurisdiction to review . . .any other decision or action of the [Secretary] . . . the \nauthority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the \n[Secretary].” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). As Section 287(g) falls within “this \nsubchapter,” 8 U.S.C. § 1357, agreements made under its provisions are within the \njurisdictional limitation. See Zafar v. United States Attorney General, 461 F.3d 1357, 1360 \n(11th Cir. 2006) (“The phrase ‘specified under this subchapter’ refers to subchapter II \nof Chapter 12, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151–1378.”). And the limitation applies to an attempt to \nimpose review of legal requirements on an ultimately discretionary decision, as here. \nSee Bouarfa, 604 U.S. at 16, 18 (“In Patel, we held that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) precludes \njudicial review of . . . ‘threshold requirements established by Congress’ to access the \nrelevant discretion”). The district court therefore erred in grounding judicial review or \nits jurisdiction on actions taken under these agreements.  \nThe district court also thoroughly misunderstood the 287(g) agreements. \nSection 287(g) agreements apply to the signatory state agencies generally and not to \nany specific facility operated by those agencies. App.87-92. Under such agreements, \n \n2 The statute refers to the Attorney General, but Congress has transferred \nenforcement of immigration laws to the Secretary of Homeland Security. See Pub. L. \nNo. 107-296, § 402, 116 Stat. 2135, 2178 (2002). \n10 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 16 of 226 \n \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) provides “direction and supervision” \nof state employees only to the extent the employees are executing “delegated \nimmigration enforcement functions” set forth in the agreement. App.93 § III, App.96 \n§ X. This includes various enforcement responsibilities that immigration officers \nperform under the INA such as arresting illegal aliens, preparing charging documents \nagainst such aliens for ICE to initiate removal proceedings, and overseeing the \ndetention of aliens while removal proceedings are pending. App. 94 § IV. A 287(g) \nagreement does not give the federal government authority over the construction of \nany facility, the physical operations at any facility, or over the state employees in any \nother respect. Even with respect to a facility where a state detains aliens under 287(g) \nauthority, the state maintains authority over the day-to-day operations of that facility \nincluding how big to make the facility, how many aliens to accept into a facility’s \npopulation, when to accept such aliens, and for how long. App.90-91.  \nInsofar as district court’s major federal action theory rests on Florida’s \nassistance in executing general detention decisions as a “functionary” of DHS, that \ntheory too fails because the decision to detain aliens cannot support a NEPA claim or \ninjunctive relief, as the state defendants explain at 31-37. If mere assistance is federal \naction then virtually anything can be federal action and the APA’s requirement of final \nagency action becomes meaningless.  \n11 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 17 of 226 \n \nC.  The district court’s order violates the precedents of the \nSupreme Court and this Court.   \nNext, NEPA documents are only one input into an agency’s decision. See Seven \nCounty, 145 S. Ct. at 1511. “The goal of the law is to inform agency decisionmaking,” \nid. at 1507, which begs the question of what decision the court-forced NEPA analysis \nis supposed to inform. Here, there has not been a major federal action, and thus there \nis no decision to make; as a result, the court-ordered analysis is futile. See S. Fla. Water \nMgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1573 (“NEPA does not require evaluation of hypothetical \nproposals, impacts and alternatives concerning a nonexistent federal proposal.”). If \nhypothetically at the end of the court-forced NEPA analysis, the federal defendants \nconclude the state detention facility’s environmental impacts are too great—then \nwhat? Neither Plaintiffs nor the district court identified any source of law giving the \nfederal defendants the authority to, for example, order Florida to close the facility. \nThe decision to site and operate the facility, including the decision to use it to detain \nillegal aliens, is Florida’s alone. Certainly, after Florida seeks federal funding, then a \nNEPA analysis may inform that decision. But until that funding request is made or \nthere is some other need for a federal decision, undertaking a costly and time-\nconsuming NEPA analysis is a wasteful endeavor.  \nAs to that future funding decision, the district court wrongfully pretermitted \nthe agencies’ discretion to determine when to prepare a NEPA document. The federal \ndefendants do not contend that NEPA obligations could never arise relating to the \n12 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 18 of 226 \n \ndetention facility. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1573. But the scope and timing \nof those future obligations are within the agencies’ substantial discretion. Id.; see also \nSeven County, 145 S. Ct. at 1512-13 (courts owe deference to agency decisions on \n“whether and to what extent” to prepare a NEPA document). It is premature, and it \nwould serve no useful purpose to undertake a NEPA analysis now when no specific \nfederal action has been proposed. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1573. Yet the \ndistrict court has overruled the agencies on this “scope and timing” question, id., \ncontrary to the “bedrock principle” of deference that is supposed to govern judicial \nreview in NEPA cases. Seven County, 145 S. Ct. at 1511, 1515. \nFor related reasons, the district court also violated Seven County’s teaching that \nan agency needs only to analyze its own proposed action. Id. at 1515. NEPA does not \nrequire an agency to consider the effects of actions that are outside the agency’s \nregulatory authority. Id. at 1515-18. The federal defendants do not control Florida’s \ndecisions related to the construction of the facility including where to site it, how big \nto make it, or how to operate it. Those are state decisions about the use of state land, \nso the environmental impacts of such decisions are also outside NEPA’s scope and \ndo not federalize otherwise local operations. See Protect Our Parks, Inc. v. Buttigieg, 39 \nF.4th 389, 399-400 (7th Cir. 2022). And whenever a future funding decision may be \nmade, it will definitionally be “separate in time” from the construction decisions at \nissue in this case, which are in the past. Seven County, 145 S. Ct. at 1517. \n13 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 19 of 226 \n \nD.  Injunctive relief for the alleged NEPA violation is improper. \nThe supposed NEPA violation does not justify an injunction anyway. \n“[R]eviewing court[s] must account for the fact that NEPA is a purely procedural statute.” \nSeven County, 145 S. Ct. at 1511 (original emphasis). The court’s review is of the final \nagency action, not the NEPA process divorced from it. Id. Accordingly, even if an \nagency’s NEPA compliance falls short, that deficiency does not justify coercive \nsanctions like vacatur or an injunction of agency action, “at least absent reason to \nbelieve that the agency might disapprove the project if it” undertook additional \nNEPA process. Id. at 1514.3 Here, there is no final federal agency action for the court \nto review, which is why the court issued a sprawling injunction targeted at no specific \nagency action. But even if, under the district court’s view, the existence of the 287(g) \nagreements means that some portion of the state’s action could be incorrectly treated \nas federal action, the statements that the district court relied on as evidence of a \npreordained federal decision (App.169-71) also establish that the outcome of the \nNEPA process is unlikely to influence the shuttering of the temporary decision facility \nor its potential federal funding.  \n \n3 Although vacatur and injunctive relief are doctrinally distinct remedies, their effects \nare similar and both are “coercive” sanctions. See Transportation Div. of the Int'l Ass’n of \nSheet Metal, Air, Rail & Transportation Workers v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 10 F.4th 869, 874 \n(D.C. Cir. 2021) (declining to grant “coercive sanction” of vacatur); WildEarth \nGuardians v. United States Bureau of Land Mgmt., 870 F.3d 1222, 1239 (10th Cir. 2017) \n(comparing vacatur to a “form of injunctive relief”).      \n14 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 20 of 226 \n \nOne can scarcely imagine a more vivid set of facts to illustrate this principle. It \nis well known that immigration enforcement is a major priority of this administration. \nSee, e.g., Protecting the American People Against Invasion, Executive Order 14159 (Jan. 20, \n2025). Indeed, it needs no citation that immigration enforcement has been a major \npriority of the current President since he first burst onto the political scene. And the \ndetention center is a high-profile example of such enforcement. See Trump Speaks at \n‘Alligator Alcatraz’ in Florida Everglades, FOX 13 Tampa Pay (July 1, 2025), \nhttps://youtu.be/KO6TByWi0w8?si=nVKzuVfhgxG6nuMf. Even if Florida’s \nconstruction of this detention center somehow (counterfactually) were converted into \nex ante federal action, it beggars belief that the federal government would have \nreached a different conclusion about the wisdom of building this facility based on \nfurther study of the marginal effect of the facility’s lights on the survival rate of \nFlorida panthers in 2070. Seven County, 145 S. Ct. at 1514. \nE.  Plaintiffs failed to prove a likelihood of irreparable harm. \nThe district court entered a preliminary injunction without finding imminent, \nirreparable harm. To obtain an injunction, a plaintiff must show irreparable harm to \ntheir concrete interests is likely, not merely possible. See Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, \n22-24 (2008). A procedural violation of NEPA alone, even after final judgment, does \nnot prove irreparable harm or automatically warrant injunctive relief. See Monsanto Co. \nv. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 157 (2010) “No such thumb on the scales is \nwarranted.” Id.  \n15 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 21 of 226 \n \nBut the district court did exactly that, placing its thumb on the scale. It found \nthat a putative NEPA violation relieved Plaintiffs of their burden to prove the \nprobability, quantity, and imminence of their irreparable harm. App.177 (“Plaintiffs \nare not required to prove harms of a particular probability or quantity”) & App.178 \nn.31 (“the harms Plaintiffs fear take time to accrue; and time and access for study is \nprecisely what NEPA procedures are meant to afford”). That is clear and reversible \nerror. Winter, 555 U.S. at 22; Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176 (“the asserted irreparable injury \nmust be neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent”). \nWhile the district court identified potential environmental harms, it identified \nno likely, imminent, or irreparable harms. For instance, the district court identified \nhabitat loss, noise, light pollution, and lost access as potential harms caused by the \nfacility. App.178-80. But these harms are not irreparable—lights, for instance, can be \nturned off—and do not support the drastic and extraordinary remedy of a preliminary \ninjunction. Besides being based on pure speculation as the state defendants explain at \n39-41, they are entirely reparable because the harm disappears if the temporary facility \ndisappears after final judgment.  \nThe identified impacts to wetlands also are insufficient to sustain a preliminary \ninjunction. Wetlands are resilient biological systems that can recover from kinds of \ndisturbances Plaintiffs allege, such as slight increases in runoff in unusual \ncircumstances. But the district court relieved Plaintiffs of proving that any potential \nwetlands impacts rose to the level of irreparable harms, and thus Plaintiff failed to \n16 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 22 of 226 \n \n“clearly establish” the required showing. Wreal, LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., 840 F.3d \n1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2016). And, importantly, the showing that Plaintiffs did make \nwas that there was potential for impacts over the “long-term.” App.177; see also \nApp.178 n.31 (“the harms Plaintiffs fear take time to accrue”). Thus, even if any \nimpacts may someday rise to the level of irreparable, those impacts are not imminent.  \nLike wetlands, wildlife species are also resilient. As such, it is well-established \nthat a party seeking a preliminary injunction based on alleged harms to wildlife must \ndemonstrate a likelihood of imminent, irreparable harm to the whole species—not \njust a few individuals. See Fund for Animals v. Frizzell, 530 F.2d 982, 986-87 (D.C. Cir. \n1975) (the “loss of only one [animal] is [not a] sufficient injury to warrant a \npreliminary injunction”); Idaho Rivers United v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 156 F. Supp. \n3d 1252, 1262 (W.D. Wash. 2015) (citing cases). The district court erred because it \nfailed to find any likely species-level harms. \nII.  The equitable factors overwhelmingly favor a stay. \n   When the United States is a party, the balance of the equities and public \ninterest factors merge because the United States’ interest is the public interest. See \nGonzalez v. Governor of Ga., 978 F.3d 1266, 1271 (11th Cir. 2020). The remaining \nequitable factors overwhelmingly favor staying the injunction, while the defendants \nappeal to correct the numerous errors identified above. The district court’s erroneous \norder threatens significant and irreparable harm to the public good, see Nken, 556 U.S. \nat 435, which greatly outweighs any claimed injury to Plaintiffs. \n17 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 23 of 226 \n \nA stay is in the public interest. There is a significant national interest in \ncombatting unlawful immigration, which favors allowing Florida to continue the \ndevelopment and use of its facility. App.195-97. As the President explained, \n“[e]nforcing our Nation’s immigration laws is critically important to the national \nsecurity and public safety of the United States.” Protecting the American People Against \nInvasion, 90 Fed. Reg. 8443, 8443 (Jan. 20, 2025); see also Trump Speaks, supra, at 4:30 \n(President Trump: “This enormous, country destroying invasion has swamped \ncommunities nationwide with massive crime, crippling costs, and burdens far beyond \nwhat any nation could withstand.”); id. at 14:25 (Secretary Noem: “[The facility] is \nexactly what we need”). If the facility is forced to wind down while the state and \nfederal defendants seek to overturn the district court’s mistaken order, this critical \nnational interest will be hindered. App.34-35, 195.   \nMaintaining detention flexibility and capacity in south Florida is crucial. \nApp.195-97. It is estimated that, among the millions of aliens that entered during the \nprevious administration, one in four provided a release address in Florida. App.197. \nDHS’s Miami field office for Enforcement and Removal Operations consistently \naccounts for a staggering 10-15% of ICE arrests nationwide. Id. As a result, all \ndetention facilities in the Miami area have been operating at or above their maximum \ncapacity. App.195. Florida’s temporary detention facility is mission “essential,” as its \nup to 2,000 beds permit DHS to keep pace with increased and often unpredictable \ndetention needs. Id. Its shuttering within 60 days as ordered by the district court \n18 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 24 of 226 \n \nwould cause irreparable harm and compromise the state and federal government’s \nability to enforce immigration laws, safeguard the public, protect national security, and \nmaintain border security. Id.. Without access to the facility’s detention space, DHS \nMiami’s ability to detain criminal aliens, including those with violent histories, will be \ndiminished. App.195-96. The reduced capacity also would negatively affect other law \nenforcement agencies who, without sufficient detention space, would be unable to \npursue arrests of criminal aliens, gang members, wanted fugitive felons, and aliens \nwith removal orders. App.196. \n  Florida’s temporary detention facility therefore is a vital tool for maintaining a \nlawful immigration and detention environment, as it has alleviated over-crowding and \nallowed DHS and its partners to fulfill their public-safety mission by taking violent \ncriminal aliens off the street. App.196-97. The district court’s injunction irreparably \nharms this mission because, without this facility, many criminal aliens would either be \nreleased back into the community or not arrested at all. App.197. The district court’s \ninjunction is therefore contrary to the public interest, and it must be stayed. See Winter, \n555 U.S. at 26 (holding that it is an abuse of discretion to issue a preliminarily \ninjunction that is contrary to the public interest).  \nAt the same time, a stay will not substantially injure Plaintiffs’ environmental \ninterests. Before becoming a detention facility, the site served as an active airfield, \nsupporting approximately 28,000 flights in the last 6 months. App.30, 43-44. The site \nhad bright lights and pre-existing buildings. And it was “very loud” with noise \n19 \n \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 25 of 226 \n \n“reverberat[ing] well beyond the airport itself.” App.44. In fact, aircraft noise was \nsubstantial as it was “loud enough to jolt most humans” and “surrounding wildlife.” \nId. Compared to the impacts of the site’s previous use as an airport, the impacts from \nthe construction or operation of the detention facility are minimal. App.31.  \nAs discussed supra at 15-17, Plaintiffs’ contrary claims of harm to their \nenvironmental interests are too distant, reparable, and speculative to support a \npreliminary injunction. Plus, FDEM has taken actions to prevent any environmental \nharm from occurring. App.45. It has initiated studies to ensure that there would be no \nmeaningful impact on local wildlife. Id. It only has paved over land that was \npreviously filled and leveled Id. It also has instituted a rigorous waste management \nprogram, constructed speed bumps to slow traffic, and installed new silt fencing to \nprevent debris from falling into surrounding wetlands. Id. And FDEM plans to build a \ndrainage basin to further prevent wetland impacts. Id.  \nIn sum, the balance of harms and public interest factors favor a stay. The \nharms to the state and federal defendants and the public are far more concrete and \nimminent compared to the distant, reparable, and speculative harms claimed by \nPlaintiffs, particularly where the district court has refused to require an adequate bond \nto cover the costs of being wrongfully enjoined. See Dep’t of Educ. v. Cali., 145 S.

This  is  an  action  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  under  the  National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.; the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; and applicable provisions of Florida law, to halt the unlawful \nconstruction of a mass federal detention facility for up to 5,000 noncitizen detainees, which the \nDefendants are calling “Alligator Alcatraz,” at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport \nApp.1\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 2 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 31 of 226 \n(“TNT Site”), a limited-use pilot training facility within the Greater Everglades, the Big Cypress \nNational Preserve and Big Cypress Area. \n2.  The TNT Site is owned by defendant Miami-Dade County and located within or \ndirectly adjacent to the Big Cypress National Preserve and the Big Cypress Area, a nationally \nand State protected, and ecologically sensitive, area that serves as habitat for endangered and \nthreatened species like the Florida panther, Florida bonneted bat, Everglade Snail kite, wood \nstork, and numerous other species. \n3.  Defendant Florida Division of Emergency Management (the “Division”), through \nits Executive Director, has entered into an arrangement, the details of which have not been made \npublic,  with  the  Defendants  U.S.  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (“USDHS”)  and  U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) to transform the TNT Site into a mass migrant \ndetention  and  deportation  center.  The  decision  to  construct  a  mass  migrant  detention  and \ndeportation center at the TNT Site was made without conducting any environmental reviews as \nrequired under NEPA, without public notice or comment, and without compliance with other \nfederal statutes such as the Endangered Species Act, or state or local land-use laws. \n4.  Defendant Miami-Dade County is a political subdivision of the State of Florida \nand is the owner of the TNT Site. \n5.  Plaintiffs  seek  an  injunction  and  declaratory  relief  to  halt  pre-construction \nactivities, construction, and related operations at the TNT Site unless and until Defendants \ncomply with NEPA and related state, federal and local environmental laws and regulations. \nSimultaneous with the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiffs have filed their Expedited Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunctive Relief under Rules 65(a) and (b), of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, and respectfully request its expedited consideration. \nApp.2\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 3 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 32 of 226 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This  Court  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1331  (federal \nquestion), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706 (APA), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq. (NEPA), and supplemental \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 over related state-law claims. \n7.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1391(b) & 1391(e)(1)(b) because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaims occurred in this district, and because the TNT Site is owned by defendant Miami-Dade \nCounty, which is located in this district. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff, Friends of the Everglades, Inc., is a Florida non-profit organization with \nmembers and directors in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Its mission includes protecting and \nrestoring the Greater Everglades ecosystem, including the Big Cypress National Preserve and \nEverglades National Park. \n9.  Friends’ members regularly visit and use the Big Cypress National Preserve for \nrecreational, aesthetic, scientific, and spiritual purposes, and intend to continue using the area in \nthis manner, and will suffer irreparable harm if the detention facility is constructed and operated \nat the TNT Site. Friends and its members will suffer procedural harm if the detention center is \nconstructed without compliance with the procedural requirements of NEPA. \n10.  Friends  was founded  in  1969  by  Marjory  Stoneman  Douglas,  a  renowned \njournalist  and  environmental  activist,  to  protect  the  Everglades  from  development  and \ndegradation. In  an  striking  echo,  the  organization’s  founding  focus  was  on  stopping  the \nconstruction of the proposed “Everglades Jetport” at the precise spot where the TNT is located. \nSince that time Friends’ mission has expanded to include preserving, protecting, and restoring \nApp.3\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 4 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 33 of 226 \nthe entire Everglades ecosystem.  Now, history is repeating itself as Friends once again must act \nto  prevent  destructive  development  in  the  heart  of  the  Everglades  ecosystem  in  the  same \nlocation. Just as Friends did in the 1960s to stop the ill-conceived Jetport, Friends now finds \nitself in a familiar fight—resisting renewed threats to the Everglades posed by the construction of \na mass detention and deportation facility at the TNT Site. \n11.  Ironically, the 1968 proposal to build the “Everglades Jetport”—now the TNT \nSite—contributed to the January 1, 1970 adoption of NEPA, and its requirement to evaluate \nreasonably anticipated environmental impacts that could result from federal action before acting. \nAfter  construction  on  the  Everglades  Jetport  commenced,  and  the  environmental  outcry—\nspearheaded  by  Friends’  founder  Marjory  Stoneman  Douglas—ensued,  the  Department  of \nInterior commissioned a 1969 report led by ecologist Luna Leopold to assess the ecological \nimpacts of the proposal. The report became one of the first de facto environmental impact \nstatements  assessing  impacts  of  federal  action,  and  illustrated  the  utility  of  evaluating \nenvironmental  impacts  before  acting.  Nathaniel  “Nat”  Reed,  who  served  as  then  Florida \nGovernor Claude Kirk’s senior advisor, used the Leopold report to persuade the Governor, who \nhad initially supported the Jetport plan, to reverse course and oppose the project—a position later \nadopted by President Richard Nixon. The Jetport plan was ultimately scuttled, and only the \nrunway—which is expressly limited to use for aviation training—remains. The Nathaniel P. \nReed Visitor Center at Big Cypress National Preserve now sits nearby the TNT Site. \n12.  Friends’ member and Executive Director Eve Samples has personally visited the \nsite and is familiar with the area. Friends’ members enjoy recreating in the Everglades and Big \nCypress  area,  including  in  panther  habitat. They  enjoy  hiking,  camping,  fishing,  kayaking, \ncanoeing, birdwatching, and viewing and photographing nature and wildlife. Since the proposal \nApp.4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 5 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 34 of 226 \nto  build  a  mass  detention  facility  in  the  Big  Cypress  National  Preserve  first  surfaced,  an \nastonishing  18,000  supporters  of  Friends  have  voiced  their  opposition  to  the  plan.  This \nopposition springs from a desire to preserve and protect the Everglades, and the Big Cypress \nNational Preserve specifically, among Friends’ members who use, fish, recreate, observe wildlife \nor otherwise enjoy the area. \n13.  Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity (the “Center”) is a national, nonprofit \nconservation organization that works through science, law, and policy to protect all species—\ngreat and small—hovering on the brink of extinction. The Center has offices throughout the \nUnited States, including in Florida, and more than 93,000 active members across the country. \n14.  The  Center’s  members  and  staff  derive  ecological,  recreational,  aesthetic, \neducational,  scientific,  professional,  and  other  benefits  from  visiting  Big  Cypress  National \nPreserve and observing the ecosystems and species who live there. The Center’s members and \nstaff live near or regularly visit Big Cypress National Preserve and the Greater Everglades \nEcosystem. \n15.  For  example,  one  Center  member,  Tierra  Curry,  is  a  scientist  committed  to \nprotecting intact ecosystems and preventing biodiversity loss. She plans to visit Big Cypress \nNational Preserve this fall 2025 to hike, paddle, and observe wildlife. Another Center member, \nAmber Crooks is a conservationist who regularly visits Big Cypress National Preserve to enjoy \nthe quiet peace of nature, to observe wildlife like red-cockaded woodpecker, and to appreciate \nremarkably dark night skies—among the darkest east of the Mississippi. \n16.  Friends  of  the  Everglades’  and  the  Center’s  members  are  being  injured  by \nDefendants’ unlawful actions, which threaten the integrity of Big Cypress National Preserve’s \nwaters and pristine night skies, the wellbeing of the plants and wildlife living there, and thus the \nApp.5\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 6 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 35 of 226 \nPlaintiffs’ interests in them. Friends and the Center are also injured by being deprived of critical \ninformation and a public process to analyze and address significant environmental impacts \nassociated with the detention center.  NEPA is a procedural statute and “[w]hen a litigant is \nvested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some possibility that the \nrequested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly \nharmed the litigant.” Okeelanta Corp. v. United States Army Corps of Eng'rs, 132 F.4th 1320, \n1332 (11th Cir. 2025) (quoting Massachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 517 (2007)). \n17.  The injuries described are actual, concrete injuries presently suffered by Plaintiffs \nand their members, and they will continue to occur unless this Court grants immediate relief. The \nrelief sought herein would redress those harms. Plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy at law. \n18.  Defendant Kevin Guthrie is the Executive Director of the Florida Division of \nEmergency Management and is sued solely in his official capacity. \n19.  Defendants Secretary Kristi Noem, in her official capacity as Secretary of the \nUnited States Department of Homeland Security (“USDHS”), and Director Todd Lyons, in his \nofficial capacity as Director of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) \nagency, are federal officials responsible for immigration enforcement and detention and have \nauthority over the arrangements for the use of the TNT Site as a mass detention center. \n20.  Defendant  Miami-Dade  County  (the  “County”)  owns  the  TNT  Site  and,  on \ninformation and belief, has acquiesced in the other Defendants transformation of the TNT Site \ninto a mass detention center even though County rules do not permit use of the TNT Site for this \npurpose. \n \n \nApp.6\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 7 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 36 of 226 \nCOMMON ALLEGATIONS \n21.  The Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport is a publicly owned airfield \nlocated within environmentally sensitive lands at the border of Miami-Dade and Collier counties, \nwithin the Big Cypress National Preserve, and within the Big Cypress Area as defined in Fla. \nStat. § 380.055. At over 17,000 acres, the TNT Site is the largest parcel of land within the Big \nCypress National Preserve not owned by the federal government. \n22.  The  Big  Cypress  National  Preserve  was  established  in  1974,  and  has  been \nexpanded since its creation. see Big Cypress National Preserve Act, Pub. L. No. 93-440, as \namended by Pub. L. No. 100-301 (the Big Cypress National Preserve Addition Act of 1988); 16 \nU.S.C. § 698f.  The Preserve was created “in order to assure the preservation, conservation and \nprotection of the natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral and faunal and recreational values in the Big \nCypress Watershed.” Pub. L. No. 93-440(a). The Preserve is managed as a unit of the National \nPark System “in a manner which will assure their natural and ecological integrity in perpetuity’ \nin accordance with the provisions of this Act and with the provisions of the Act of August 25, \n1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4), as amended and supplemented.” Pub. L. No. 100-301 § 4(a), \nBig Cypress National Preserve Addition Act of 1988.   \n23.  The Big Cypress National Preserve area where the TNT Site is located is known \nfor its wetlands, critical wildlife habitat, and protected species, including the threatened wood \nstork, and endangered Florida bonneted bat and the Florida panther. The Site is within an \nenvironmentally sensitive freshwater wetland ecosystem of ecological significance for wildlife \nhabitat. The Site is important for drinking water supply and Everglades water quality.  \n24.  The Big Cypress Preserve is home to various listed threatened or endangered \nspecies including the Florida bonneted bat, the Florida panthers, wood stork, Everglade snail \nApp.7\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 8 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 37 of 226 \nkite,  and  others,  as  documented  in  the  Big  Cypress  National  Preserve  website.  See, \nhttps://www.nps.gov/bicy/learn/nature/animals.htm, last visited June 25, 2025.  Florida panthers \nhave been geolocated on the TNT Site on many occasions. The map below shows Florida \npanthers geolocated on the TNT Site: \n \n25.  Florida bonneted bats have also been documented in the Big Cypress National \nPreserve. See 78 Fed. Reg. 61004, 61008, 61011 (Oct. 2, 2013). \n26.  In the Big Cypress Conservation Act of 1973, Fla. Stat. § 380.055, the Florida \nLegislature determined that “the Big Cypress Area is an area containing and having a significant \nimpact upon environmental and natural resources of regional and statewide importance and that \ndesignation  of  the  area  as  an  area  of  critical  state  concern  is  desirable  and  necessary  to \naccomplish the purposes of ‘The Florida Environmental Land and Water Management Act of \n1972’ and to implement s. 7, Art. II of the State Constitution.” Fla. Stat. § 380.055(2). \n27.  The TNT Site is within the Big Cypress National Preserve as illustrated below: \nApp.8\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 9 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 38 of 226 \n \n \n28.  The TNT Site’s location within the Big Cypress National Preserve is further \nillustrated by the below GIS map: \nApp.9\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 10 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 39 of 226 \n \n29.  The TNT Site is also proximate to Everglades National Park, and part of the \nhistoric  Everglades.  Since  the  passage  of  the  Comprehensive  Everglades  Restoration  Plan \n(“CERP”) in 2000, the federal government and the State of Florida have jointly committed to one \nof the most ambitious ecosystem restoration efforts in the world. Authorized by Section 601 of \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000), Pub. L. No. 106-541, 114 Stat. \n2572, CERP provides a framework for restoring, preserving, and protecting the South Florida \necosystem, including the Everglades, over multiple decades. The Plan encompasses more than 60 \nprojects designed to improve water quality, restore hydrologic flow, and protect critical habitat. \n30.  Under  CERP,  the  federal  government,  through  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  and \nEngineers  (“USACE”)  and  the  Department  of  the  Interior  (“DOI”),  fund  half  the  costs  of \nrestoration. The State of Florida contributes the other half, with each partner committing billions \nApp.10\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 11 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 40 of 226 \nof dollars to implementation. As of 2024, total appropriations for Everglades restoration from \nboth federal and state sources exceed $20 billion—much of which has been allocated since \n2019—reflecting a sustained, bipartisan commitment to safeguarding the ecological integrity of \nthe Everglades and adjacent areas like Big Cypress National Preserve.  \n31.  These investments are reinforced by successive authorizations and appropriations \nthrough subsequent federal legislation, including the Water Resources Development Acts of \n2007, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024 each of which reauthorized and expanded CERP \ncomponents.  The  State  of  Florida  has  likewise  demonstrated  its  ongoing  commitment  to \nEverglades restoration through substantial state funding, including over $3.5 billion committed \nbetween 2019 and 2024 alone under Florida’s “Everglades Restoration Strategy.” These efforts \nsupport not only environmental protection, but also flood control, drinking water supply, and \nbiodiversity, and endangered species habitat preservation and conservation across South Florida.  \n32.  One  recent  component  of  CERP is  the  Western  Everglades  Restoration  Plan \n(“WERP”), which will use a series of active and passive water management features, water \nquality features, and alterations to existing canals and levees with a goal of improving the \nquantity, quality, timing and distribution of water in the Western Everglades in the effort to re-\nestablish ecological connectivity, reduce the severity and frequency of wildfires, and restore low \nnutrient conditions.  The TNT sits within the WERP footprint as illustrated below: \nApp.11\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 12 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 41 of 226 \n \nApp.12\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 13 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 42 of 226 \n33.  The Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport site, which is within and/or \nborders  the  Big  Cypress  National  Preserve,  lies  within  the  broader  Everglades  ecosystem \nrestoration footprint, and any development at that site that disrupts hydrologic connectivity or \ndegrades environmental conditions threatens to undermine the very objectives that these federal \nand state investments were intended to achieve. \n34.  The Division has recently entered into an arrangement with DHS to allow the use \nof the TNT Site as a mass detention facility for ICE.  DHS has advised that it intends to detain up \nto 5,000  for federal immigration purposes. In a statement, DHS advised that Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (“FEMA”) shelter program funds would be used to pay the Division \napproximately $450 million a year to operate the detention centers, which the Division has \ndubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” \n35.  During a press conference on June 25, 2025, Governor DeSantis noted that federal \nagencies would fully fund the detention center, stating: “This is fully funded by the federal \ngovernment”; “This is something that was requested by the federal government, and this is \nsomething  that  the  federal  government  is  going  to  fully  fund”;  “From  a  state  taxpayer \nperspective,  we  are  implementing  it  ...  but  that  will  be  fully  reimbursed  by  the  federal \ngovernment.”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJfG7L9reHU&ab_channel=FOX35Orlando, \n(at 6:01 timemark), last visited June 27, 2025. \n36.  As these public statements confirm, the Division is acting as the agent of federal \nimmigration enforcement agencies in transporting and detaining noncitizens to the TNT Site, and \nfacilitating the deportation of noncitizens from the Site. \n37.  In correspondence with Miami-Dade County, Mr. Guthrie stated that the Division \nintends to use the Site “to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement.” Florida \nApp.13\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 14 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 43 of 226 \nAttorney General James Uthemeier has been quoted that the TNT Site, with its runway, is \nintended to be used to “detain, deport and get people out of this country.” In correspondence to \nthe County, Division Executive Director Guthrie states that the Division, “has identified the \n[Site] as a critical asset for ongoing and future emergency response, aviation logistics, and \nstaging operations,” suggesting that the TNT Site will be used for deportation flights. \n38.  The  planned  use  of  the  TNT  Site  includes  the  installation  of  prefabricated \nhousing, water and sewage infrastructure, security fencing, high-intensity security lighting, and \nother structures. In addition, numerous fill laden dump trucks have been observed entering the \nSite. As noted, the Division has also expressed a desire to utilize the runway in connection with \nreceiving and deporting detainees from the Site. \n39.  Construction on the detention center has unfolded at a breakneck pace, and is \nongoing. The Division took control of the Site only on June 23, 2025. Since then kitchen \nfacilities, restrooms, housing facilities, portable industrial lighting, and other infrastructure have \nbeen positioned on site, and heavy vehicular traffic on and out of the site has been observed, and \nis ongoing. A steady stream of fill-laden dump trucks have been observed entering and exiting \nthe Site in recent days. State officials have publicly stated that they expect to begin housing \ndetainees at the TNT Site by July 1, 2025.  \n40.  The photo below shows dump trucks with covered cargo entering the TNT Site \nearlier this week: \nApp.14\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 15 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 44 of 226 \n  \n41.

Below are images of portable generators, also published in the Miami Herald, \ndepicting industrial generators being delivered to the site: \n \n43.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, no environmental assessment or environmental impact \nstatement has been prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ \n4321, et seq., nor has the Division conducted any environmental review under Florida law. \n44.  Defendant Miami-Dade County, while unlawfully allowing its TNT Site to be \noccupied by agencies seeking to enforce federal immigration laws, has questioned the lack of \nany environmental analyses regarding the project. On June 23, 2025, Miami-Dade County Mayor \nDaniella Levine Cava wrote to the Division and stated: “With the federal and state government \ninvesting well over $10 billion since 2019 in Everglades restoration and protection, we would \nappreciate  a  detailed  analysis  and  report  on  environmental  impacts  of  this  facility  to  the \nApp.16\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 17 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 46 of 226 \nEverglades.  We  would  also  value  input  from  the  appropriate  federal  agencies  on  their \nenvironmental reviews and analyses prior to proceeding.” \n45.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, Defendants have not conferred with the USACE, DOI, \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or any other federal or local agency regarding potential impacts \nfrom the construction of a detention center for 5,000 individuals at the TNT Site. \n46.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, no categorical exclusion from NEPA has been invoked \nby the Defendants, nor does any apply. \n47.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, no exemption or waiver of NEPA requirements has \nbeen invoked by Defendants, and none exist. \n48.  There is no emergency that would warrant departure from NEPA’s requirements, \nas NEPA contains no exception for emergencies. Even if an emergency existed, none of the \nDefendants have made alternative arrangements as was required under NEPA regulations, which, \nin any event, have recently been withdrawn. \n49.  No public notice or hearing has been conducted in connection with the use of the \nTNT Site for migrant detention. \n50.  The property is subject to intergovernmental agreements and historical land use \nrestrictions related to its location within the footprint of the Big Cypress National Preserve and \nState Big Cypress Area. \n51.  The hasty transformation of the Site into a mass detention facility, which includes \nthe installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services systems, industrial \nhigh-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering \nthe natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of \nthe runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts. The Defendants, \nApp.17\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 18 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 47 of 226 \nin their rush to build the center, have unlawfully bypassed the required environmental reviews. \nThe direct and indirect harm to nearby wetlands, wildlife, and air and water quality, and feasible \nalternatives to the action, must be considered under NEPA before acting. \n52.  The TNT Site is highly susceptible to flooding and no feasible plan has been \nstudied to evacuate center detainees and personnel in the event of a hurricane or major flooding \nevent.  \n53.  DHS also violated the Endangered Species Act by, among other things, failing to \nconsult with USFWS.  Plaintiffs intend to amend this Complaint to add the ESA claims after the \nrequired 60-day pre-suit notice, 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2)(A)(i), period has expired. \n54.  Additionally,  to  Plaintiffs’  knowledge,  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  acting \nthrough the Director of the National Park Service, has taken no action to regulate the use of the \nBig Cypress National Preserve in such manner and by such means that will leave the Preserve \nunimpaired by the environmental impacts of the TNT Site and associated operations.   \n55.  The National Park Service Organic Act of 1916, (16 U.S.C. § 1, amended and \nrecodified in 54 U.S.C. § 100101(a) (2014)), states, “The Secretary, acting through the Director \nof the National Park Service, shall promote and regulate the use of the National Park System by \nmeans  and  measures  that  conform  to  the  fundamental  purpose  of  the  System  units,  which \npurpose is to conserve the scenery, natural and historic objects, and wild life in the System units \nand to provide for the enjoyment of the scenery, natural and historic objects, and wild life in such \nmanner  and  by  such  means  as  will  leave  them  unimpaired  for  the  enjoyment  of  future \ngenerations.” \n56.  This  “non-impairment”  mandate  was  reaffirmed  by  Congress  in  the  1978 \namendments to the Act. The 1978 Reaffirmation states: “Congress reaffirms, declares, and \nApp.18\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 19 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 48 of 226 \ndirects that the promotion and regulation of the various System units shall be consistent with and \nfounded in the purpose by subsection (a), to the common benefit of all the people of the United \nStates.  The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and \nadministration of the System units shall be conducted in light of the high public value and \nintegrity of the System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for \nwhich the System units have been established, except as directly and specifically provided by \nCongress.”  54 U.S.C. § 100101(b). \n57.  The Big Cypress National Preserve was established to “assure the preservation, \nconservation,  and  protection  of  the  natural,  scenic,  hydrologic,  floral,  and  faunal,  and \nrecreational values of the Big Cypress Watershed in the State of Florida and to provide for the \nenhancement and public enjoyment thereof.” Pub. L. No. 93-440(a). \n58.  The TNT facility and associated operations will use and impair the Big Cypress \nNational Preserve by causing direct and indirect harm to its wetlands, wildlife, and air and water \nquality. These impacts will result in the degradation of the natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral, and \nfaunal, and recreational values for which the Preserve was created.  \n59.  The  Secretary  of  the  Interior  and  the  National  Park  Service’s  apparent \nacquiescence in DHS and ICE’s funding and operating the TNT facility in a manner that will \nresult in significant environmental harm to the Preserve, does not comport with the Act’s non-\nimpairment mandate, is in derogation of the values and purposes for which the Preserve was \nestablished, and is not otherwise directly and specifically allowed by Congress. Plaintiffs reserve \nthe right to amend this Complaint to add the Secretary of Interior. \n60.  All conditions precedent to the maintenance of this action have occurred, been \nwaived, or both. \nApp.19\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 20 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 49 of 226 \nCOUNT I \n(VIOLATION OF NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA)) \n(Against the DIVISION, DHS and ICE) \n \n61.  Plaintiffs reallege the Common Allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n62.  The  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA),  42  U.S.C.  §  4321  et  seq., \nrequires federal agencies to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for any major \nfederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, or an Environmental \nAssessment (EA) if the agency action does not have reasonably foreseeable significant effects on \nthe human environment, or if the significance of such effect is unknown. \n63.  Major federal actions include any action that is subject to “substantial Federal \ncontrol and responsibility.” 42 U.S.C. § 4336e(10). \n64.  The  construction  of  an  immigration  detention  center  is  an  action  that  is \nnecessarily subject to federal control and responsibility. The State of Florida has no authority or \njurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 \n(2012)  (holding  federal  law  preempts  state  immigration  law  enforcement).  In  Arizona,  the \nSupreme Court reaffirmed “the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of \nthe Federal Government.” Id. at 409. The Court explained that “decision[s] on removability [of \nnoncitizens] requires a determination whether it is appropriate to allow a foreign national to \ncontinue living in the United States. Decisions of this nature touch on foreign relations and must \nbe made with one voice.” Id. (quoting Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (“Policies \npertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here are ... entrusted exclusively to \nCongress ...”)).  \n65.  In Fla. Stat. § 908.13, the Florida legislature authorized the Division to facilitate \nthe transport of detainees on the condition that ICE “specifically request assistance from the \nApp.20\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 21 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 50 of 226 \ndivision with the transport of unauthorized aliens pursuant to specific federal legal authority.” Id. \n§ 908.13(2)(a). Additionally, ICE “must reimburse the state for the actual cost of assisting with \nthe transport of unauthorized aliens.” Id. § 908.13(2)(b). Any such transport “must occur under \nthe direct control and supervision of” ICE. Id. § 908.13(2)(c) (emphasis added). Because state \nlaw requires that the Division’s transportation of detainees to and from the detention center occur \nunder the “direct control and supervision” of ICE, the TNT detention center project is statutorily \nrequired  to  be  under  “Federal  control  and  responsibility,”  42  U.S.C.  §  4336e(10),  thereby \ntriggering NEPA. In this way, the Division is acting as agent for DHS and ICE.  \n66.  Florida Attorney General Uthmeier has announced that the TNT Site will be used \n“in support of the Trump administration” in federal immigration law enforcement. The Attorney \nGeneral has posted on social media that “Alligator Alcatraz [is] the one-stop shop to carry out \nPresident Trump’s mass deportation agenda.” He accompanied the post with a video of the TNT \nSite runway. Governor DeSantis has been quoted as stating the TNT Site is to “facilitate the \nfederal government in immigration enforcement.” \n67.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 4336e(10), Congress identified non-major federal actions as \nactions conducted with “no or minimal Federal funding.” Conversely, infrastructure projects like \nthis one that are funded and/or approved by the Federal government, require federal agencies to \nprepare an EIS for actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment or an \nEA if the agency action does not have reasonably foreseeable significant effect on the human \nenvironment or if the significance of such effect is unknown. The evaluation must address the \nsignificant environmental effects of a proposed project and identify feasible alternatives that \ncould mitigate those effects. NEPA is a procedural statute that requires federal agencies to \nprepare an environmental impact statement, or EIS, identifying significant environmental effects \nApp.21\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 22 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 51 of 226 \nof the projects, as well as feasible alternatives. The law ensures that the agency and the public \nare aware of the environmental consequences of proposed projects. Properly applied, NEPA \nhelps agencies to make better decisions and to ensure good project management.  \n68.  Specifically, an EIS must include a “detailed statement” addressing the following: \n(i)  reasonably  foreseeable  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  agency  action;  (ii)  any \nreasonably  foreseeable  adverse  environmental  effects  which  cannot  be  avoided  should  the \nproposal be implemented; (iii) a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed agency action, \nincluding an analysis of any negative environmental impacts of not implementing the proposed \nagency action in the case of a no action alternative, that are technically and economically \nfeasible, and meet the purpose and need of the proposal; (iv) the relationship between local short-\nterm  uses  of  man's  environment  and  the  maintenance  and  enhancement  of  long-term \nproductivity; and (v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of Federal resources which \nwould be involved in the proposed agency action should it be implemented. 42 U.S.C. §§ \n4332(C)((i)-(v). \n69.  Moreover, NEPA requires that “[p]rior to making any detailed statement,” the \nhead of the lead agency “shall consult with and obtain the comments of any Federal agency \nwhich has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact \ninvolved.”  Id. § 4332(C). Because actions associated with the construction and operation of the \ndetention center at the TNT Site are within a national preserve that includes primary habitat for \nthe Florida panther and critical habitat for the Florida bonneted bat, at a bare minimum federal \nlaw requires USDHS to consult with the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService in assessing the environmental impacts of its proposed project. \nApp.22\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 23 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 52 of 226 \n70.  NEPA contains no exceptions for emergency actions, and no emergency exists. \nNEPA regulations provided that in cases of emergencies such as a hurricane, flood or wildfire, a \nfederal  agency  should  consult  with  the  Council  about  alternative  arrangements.  These \narrangements must be limited to actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the \nemergency.” 40 C.F.R. § 1506.12. These regulations, however, have been withdrawn. In any \nevent, there is no emergency and, even if there was, no alternative arrangements have been \nimplemented. \n71.  The arrangements between the Division, USDHS and ICE to transform the TNT \nSite into a mass detention and deportation facility constitute major federal action, as it involves \nthe  use  of  federal  authority,  approvals,  funding  and  resources,  and  will  have  significant \nenvironmental impacts on an ecologically sensitive area. Those impacts, which to date have gone \nunevaluated, could logically include impacts to listed species, impacts to wetlands and surface \nwaters, impacts due to increased activities at the Site, including traffic to and from the Site, \nhurricane and flooding preparedness, etc.  \n72.  To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, no EA or EIS has been prepared by DHS, ICE, the \nDivision, or any cooperating agency. \n73.  The failure to conduct the required environmental review under NEPA violates \nfederal law and deprives the public and affected stakeholders, including Plaintiffs, of required \nprocedures and procedural environmental protections. \n74.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief requiring compliance \nwith NEPA before any further activity occurs at the TNT Site. \n \n \nApp.23\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 24 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 53 of 226 \nCOUNT II \n(VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (APA) \n(Against DHS and ICE)) \n \n75.  Plaintiffs reallege the Common Allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n76.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., permits judicial \nreview of final agency actions that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law. \n77.  USDHS and ICE have approved or are implementing the use of the TNT Site \nwithout providing Plaintiffs and the public with an opportunity for notice and comment, and \nwithout adhering to required environmental review procedures under NEPA and other federal \nlaws, including the Endangered Species Act, and the National Park Service Organic Act of 1916, \n(16 U.S.C. § 1, amended and recodified in 54 U.S.C. § 100101(a) (2014)). \n78.  The decision to proceed without notice, comment and without an EA or EIS \nconstitutes final agency action and is subject to judicial review. \n79.  Plaintiffs are  entitled to a declaration that the  agency’s conduct is unlawful, \ndirecting vacatur of the agency action, as well as an injunction preventing further activity until \nNEPA compliance is achieved. \nCOUNT III \n(ULTRA VIRES ACTION (Against the Division)) \n \n80.  Plaintiffs reallege the Common Allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n81.  The Division of Emergency Management is governed by Chapter 252, Florida \nStatutes. \n82.  Nothing in Chapter 252 authorizes the Division to convert county-owned property \ninto a federal detention center without legislative authority, environmental review, or compliance \nwith local land use requirements. \nApp.24\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 25 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 54 of 226 \n83.  Moreover, Florida law requires that, before the State of Florida may construct a \ncorrectional facility, it must consult with local governments with jurisdiction over the proposed \nsite to determine if the proposed facility would comply with applicable local land use laws.  Fla. \nStat. § 944.095(2). Florida law further provides that local governments have 90 days to review \nany proposed correctional facility to determine if it complies with the applicable land use laws.  \nThe Division has not complied with these legal requirements. \n84.  The Division has no independent legislative authority to construct and manage a \ncorrectional facility.  Under Florida law, a correctional facility means any “prison, road camp … \nprison forestry camp … prison farm [whether] temporary or permanent.” Section 944.02(8), Fla. \nStat. “Prisoner” includes any person “under civil or criminal arrest [and committed] to the \ncustody of the department pursuant to lawful authority.” Id. § 944.02(6). These provisions apply \nto the Florida Department of Corrections, however, not the Division which has no authority to \ndetain persons under Florida law. \n85.  Defendant’s actions exceed the scope of authority granted by Florida law. \n86.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  declaratory  relief  under  28  U.S.C.  §  2201  that  the \nDivision’s arrangement with DHS is ultra vires and void, and the construction of the TNT Site \ndetention center is being conducted in derogation of state law. \n87.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to injunctive relief preventing further construction or \noperation at the site. \nCOUNT IV \n(Violation of Miami-Dade County Code and CDMP (against Miami-Dade County)) \n \n88.  Plaintiffs reallege the Common Allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n89.  Pursuant  to  the  County’s  Operational  Directive  No.  15-02,  the  TNT  Site  is \ngoverned by Chapter 25 of the Miami-Dade County Code, pertaining to aviation operations.  \nApp.25\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 26 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 55 of 226 \n90.  The TNT Site is permitted only for aviation uses including pilot flight training, \npilot proficiency checks, and aircraft maintenance flight checks. \n91.  In addition, the Site, or a portion of it, is designated Environmentally Protected \nParks  under  Miami-Dade  Counties  Comprehensive  Development  Master  Plan  due  to  its \nenvironmental sensitivity. \n92.  The Site is not permitted or authorized for use for non-flight purposes. \n93.  The County’s agreement or acquiescence in allowing the TNT Site for use as a \nmas detention center is in violation of the County code and permitting regimes. \n94.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 that the County may \nnot authorize or allow use of the TNT Site for purposes other than that allowed under the County \nCode and existing permits and authorizations. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Friends of the Everglades respectfully requests that the Court: \n \nA.  Declare that Defendants’ actions violate NEPA and the APA; \n \nB.  Enjoin any further pre-construction activities, construction, conversion, or use of \nthe TNT Site for purposes of immigration detention unless and until Defendants comply with \nNEPA and the APA; \n \nC.  Declare that Defendant Guthrie’s actions exceed lawful authority under Florida \nlaw and violate state environmental and land use laws; \n \nD.  Enjoin Defendant Guthrie from authorizing or permitting further development or \nuse of the TNT Site for purposes related to a mass detention center; \n \nE.  Enjoin  the  County  from  permitting  the  use  of  property  limited  to  aviation \nactivities as a mass detainment center. \n \nF.  Award Plaintiffs their attorneys’ fees and costs as allowed by law; \n \nG.  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \nApp.26\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/27/2025   Page 27 of 27\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 56 of 226 \nDated:   June 27, 2025 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nEARTHJUSTICE  COFFEY BURLINGTON, P.L. \n4500 Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 201  2601 South Bayshore Drive, Penthouse One \nMiami, Florida  33137  Miami, Florida  33133 \nTelephone:  (305) 440-5432  Telephone:  (305) 858-2900 \n   \nBy:      s/    Tania Galloni        By:      s/    Paul J.

I am currently both the Acting Deputy Executive Associate Director (D-EAD) for the\nUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n1 \nApp.32\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 21-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 3 of 5\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 62 of 226 \n(ICE), Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and the Interim Assistant Director for Field \nOperations within ERO. I have been the Acting D-EAD of ERO since June 30, 2025, and the \nInterim Assistant Director for Field Operations since May 2025. \n2. As the Acting D-EAD of ERO, I oversee the mission of ERO’s eight headquarters\ndivisions:  Enforcement,  Removal,  Non-Detained  Management,  Custody  Management,  Field \nOperations, ICE Health Service Corps, Law Enforcement Systems and Analysis, and Operations \nSupport. As the interim Assistant Director for Field Operations, I oversee and direct all ERO field \noperations activities nationwide and ensure coordination among all ERO field offices. I have \nprincipal oversight over the full scope of immigration enforcement activities and programs through \nwhich ERO identifies, arrests, refers for prosecution, and removes illegal aliens from the United \nStates. \n3. I began my career in federal law enforcement in 2001 as a Deportation Officer in the Seattle\nfield office and was eventually promoted to Supervisory Detention and Deportation Officer and \nAssistant Field Office Director. In 2012, I was selected to serve as a Deputy Chief of Staff for ERO \nat ICE headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the following year, I served as the Chief of Staff. \nFollowing that, I served as the Field Office Director for the Atlanta and Los Angeles ERO field \noffices. In the Los Angeles field office, I oversaw 505 authorized positions and managed an annual \nbudget  of  $110  million  dollars.  Prior  to  serving  as  the Acting Assistant  Director  for  Field \nOperations, I served as the Assistant Director for the Non-Detained Management Division within \nERO. \n4. I am familiar with the allegations made by plaintiffs in the instant lawsuit regarding the\ndetention facility being constructed at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport near the \nBig Cypress National Preserve (TNT Detention Facility). \n2 \nApp.33\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 21-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 4 of 5\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 63 of 226 \n5.(cid:3) ICE is not providing any funding for the construction of the TNT Detention Facility. The(cid:3)\nState  of  Florida  is  responsible  for  the  funding  and(cid:3) construction  of  the  facility.  ICE’s  role \nconcerning the development of the TNT Detention Facility has been limited to touring the facility \nto ensure compliance with ICE detention standards, and meeting with officials from the State of \nFlorida to discuss operational matters. \n6. The ultimate decision of who to detain at the TNT Detention Facility belongs to Florida.\n7. If Florida decides to detain any illegal aliens at the TNT Detention Facility, they would do\nso under the authority delegated pursuant to section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g). \n8.(cid:3) Many Florida entities have entered 287g agreements since President Trump took office,(cid:3)\nincluding  the  Florida  National  Guard  and  several  Florida  law  enforcement  entities.  Those \nagreements,  including  the  date  they  were  signed,  are  available  on  ICE’s  website.  See \nparticipatingAgencies07012025pm.xlsx. The agreements generally authorize those entities to \ndetain aliens under the immigration laws. ICE’s understanding is that Florida intends to operate its \n287(g) facilities under those existing agreements. \n9.(cid:3) When ICE procures detention space from a state or local entity, it pays for that space via(cid:3)\nits appropriation for Operations and Support, which includes funding for enforcement, detention \nand removal operations. When it does so, the aliens are detained by a contractor on behalf of ICE. \n10.(cid:3) ICE has not purchased or otherwise procured any detention space from Florida for the(cid:3)\ndetention of illegal aliens at the TNT Detention Facility. \n11.(cid:3) While the TNT Detention Facility is a concern of the State of Florida, its use in detaining(cid:3)\naliens operationally benefits ICE as it will maximize detention capacity in furtherance of ICE’s \n3 \nApp.34\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 21-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 5 of 5\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 64 of 226 \nimmigration  enforcement  mission.

I am the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator at the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency (“FEMA” or “agency”). FEMA is a component\nwithin the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). As the Senior Official\nPerforming the Duties of the FEMA Administrator, I am the DHS official\nresponsible for being the principal advisor to the President and Secretary of\nHomeland Security (“Secretary”) for all matters related to emergency management in\nthe United States. I am also vested with the authority to manage and administer the\nvarious grant programs assigned to FEMA directly by statute or through delegation\nfrom the Secretary. I am familiar with the grant programs administered by FEMA\nand the policies and procedures governing these programs.\n2. My statements in this Declaration are based on my personal knowledge, on\ninformation provided to me in my official capacity; on reasonable inquiry;\ninformation obtained from various records, systems, databases, DHS, or FEMA\nemployees and information portals maintained and relied upon by the DHS in the\nregular course of business; and on my evaluation of that information.\nApp1. 37\n\nCas e 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 21-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 3 of 3\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 67 of 226 \n3.  DHS/FEMA announced $600 million in federal funding for the Detention Support \nGrant Program (DSGP). The DSGP will provide financial assistance through a \nfederal award to support sheltering of illegal aliens in a detention environment and \nrelated activities to avoid overcrowding in U.S. Customs and Border Protection \nshort-term holding facilities. The only eligible applicant under the DSGP is the \nFlorida Division of Emergency Management.  \n4.  Once the DSGP is finalized, DHS/FEMA will send the Florida Division of \nEmergency Management a grant notification letter. The grant notification letter is the \nofficial communication from DHS/FEMA that explains the grant application process \nand will include proposed terms and conditions of the grant including allowable \ncosts. The Florida Department of Emergency Management must then apply for a \nDSGP federal award. The Florida Department of Emergency Division has not yet \napplied for a DSGP award, and DHS/FEMA has not yet approved a federal award.  I \nam not aware of any other grant applications that Florida has submitted to FEMA in \nconnection with the temporary detention center at issue in this case. \n5.  Costs for constructing new, permanent buildings are not allowable under the DSGP. \n \n \nI, David Richardson, declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \n \nExecuted on July 2 2025 \n  David Richardson \nSenior Official Performing the Duties of the \nAdministrator \n  Federal Emergency Management Agency \nApp2. 38\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 1 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 68 of 226 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nNo. 25-cv-22896-KMW \n \n   \nFRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., et al.,\n     \n  Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nKRISTI NOEM, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nDECLARATION OF IAN GADEA-GUIDICELLI \n \nI, Ian Gadea-Guidicelli, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare under penalty of \nperjury that the following is true and correct based upon my personal knowledge and review of the \nrelevant records.  If called as a witness, I could and would competently testify to the matters set \nforth herein. \n1.  I am the State Emergency Response Team (SERT) Chief and Bureau Chief of \nResponse at the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM).  I hold a bachelor’s degree \nin  International  Affairs  from  Florida  State  University  and  a  Master’s  degree  in  Public \nAdministration from the University of Central Florida.  I have worked at FDEM for the past nine \nyears.   \n2.  In my role as SERT Chief and Bureau Chief of Response, I lead the State’s \npreparedness and response to emergencies and disasters.  My duties require that I oversee the \noperations of multiple bureaus and governmental agencies; direct high-level policy and logistical \ndecisions; coordinate with internal and external stakeholders to ensure a unified and effective \nApp.39\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 2 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 69 of 226 \nemergency response; and work closely with Executive Director Guthrie to carry out his mission to \nprotect our State from both natural and man-made disasters and emergencies. \n3.  In  2023,  Governor  Ron  DeSantis  declared  that  the  illegal  immigration  crisis \naffecting our Nation poses a statewide emergency.  Ex. 1.  Governor DeSantis has extended that \nemergency declaration to the present date.  Ex. 2.  Those orders have empowered FDEM to direct \nthe State’s response to that emergency and, among other things:  \n(cid:120)  Seek direct assistance and enter into agreements with any and all agencies of the \nfederal government as may be needed to meet this emergency. \n(cid:120)  Direct  all  state,  regional,  and  local  governmental  agencies,  including  law \nenforcement agencies, to identify personnel needed from those agencies to assist in \nmeeting the response, recovery, and mitigation needs created by this emergency, \nand to place all such personnel under the direct command and coordination of the \nFDEM to meet this emergency. \n(cid:120)  Suspend the effect of any statute, rule, or order that would in any way prevent, \nhinder, or delay any mitigation, response, or recovery action necessary to cope with \nthis emergency.  Ex. 1. \n4.  In June 2025, Executive Director Guthrie used his emergency powers to assume \ncontrol over the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT) to build a detention facility \nfor illegal aliens pending deportation.  Ex. 3.  As SERT Chief and Bureau Chief of Response, I am \ncharged with supervising and coordinating FDEM’s day-to-day operations at the site.  Though I \nconduct my business primarily from FDEM headquarters in Tallahassee, I have visited the facility \nseveral times and am deeply familiar with its operation, physical layout, and on-site structures.   \n2 \nApp.40\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 3 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 70 of 226 \n5. To effectively carry out my responsibilities, it is essential that I understand the \nairport’s prior operations and condition to determine the most appropriate use of the site in \nresponse to the immigration emergency.  Accordingly, I have familiarized myself with the site’s \nhistorical  condition  and  operations  through,  among  other  things, discussions  with  Joseph \nKinnebrew, TNT Airport Manager for Miami-Dade County, and by reviewing business records he \nprovided.\n6. TNT is a small airportowned by Miami-Dade County that isalmost entirely located \ninthe townOchopee,  in Collier County, Florida.  A tinygrass extension of the airport runway lies\nin Miami-Dade County.  The attached schematic, Ex. 4,which I received during the course of my \nordinary duties at FDEM, outlines TNTbefore the detention facility was built:\n7. In this image, the pale blue line surrounding the runway reflects the airport’s fenced \nperimeter.  This fence line extends around the entire airport.  The images attached herewere taken \n3\nApp.41\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 4 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 71 of 226 \nby me and accurately reflect the perimeter fence.  Comp. Ex. 5.  It is roughly eight feet tall and is \ntopped with barbed wire.  The fence existed at the airport long before the detention facility was \nbuilt. \n8. The red line on the right side of the above image reflects the county line dividing\nCollier County on the left and Miami-Dade County on the right.  The red line on the left side of \nthe image reflects the service road that leads to the airport’s main gate from Tamiami Trail.  The \ntrapezoidal structure in the center of the image reflects the airport runway and taxiway.  The square \nstructure immediately above the runway and taxiway is an aircraft loading area, which currently \nhouses the detention facility.\n9. The full extent of the airport area that has been commandeered for FDEM’s \noperations is reflected in red in the image below, which was created by FDEM staff, at my \ndirection, using a standard GIS application:\n4\nApp.42\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 5 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 72 of 226 \nEx. 6. \n10.  The line that bisects the image above again reflects the county line dividing Collier \nCounty on the left and Miami-Dade County on the right.  As reflected in the box above the image’s \nlegend, the total area reflected in red amounts to roughly 1119 acres.  Of that acreage, 1096 acres \nare in Collier County and 23 acres are in Miami-Dade County.  As a percentage, 98% of the land \ncommandeered by FDEM exists in Collier; just 2% exists in Miami-Dade.  The small portion of \nthe airport that exists in Miami-Dade is unpaved and devoid of critical infrastructure.  As a result, \nnone of FDEM’s operations have taken or will take place in the Miami-Dade portion of the airport.  \nFDEM’s day-to-day operations at TNT have been, and will remain, confined to Collier County. \n11.  In the course of my duties managing the detention facility, I have received flight \nlogs for the airport from Joseph Kinnebrew, TNT’s Airport Manager.  Ex. 7.  These logs contain \ndetailed flight data for the airport from January 1, 2025 to July 23, 2025.  The data reflects that \n27,997 landings and take offs occurred during that time span—roughly 137 operations a day.  \nHowever, this data likely underestimates the average number of daily operations in the past several \nmonths because it includes a month of data from after the State commandeered the airport on June \n23, 2025.  During that period, public flights at the airport quickly ceased, meaning that the overall \naverage flight activity from January 1 to July 23 would be much higher if the detention facility had \nnot been built. \n12.  The flight logs reflect that, of the 27,997 operations at TNT in the past several \nmonths, 4,349 involved multi-engine planes; 391 involved business jets; 137 involved helicopters; \n521 involved military planes; and 199 involved military helicopters.  Many of these flights \noccurred in the daytime, but the airport also was open for night flights upon request.  \n5 \nApp.43\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 6 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 73 of 226 \n13.  Before the detention facility opened at the site, training pilots typically used TNT \nto practice “touch and gos.”  In a touch and go, a pilot will take off, fly a short distance, land, and \nthen take off again without coming to a complete stop or deplaning.  It is my understanding that \nMiami-Dade County’s flight-tracking software did not log touch and go operations until November \n2024.  Accordingly, the flight data recorded in that software severely underreported the total flight \noperations occurring at the airport on a daily basis.  In other words, it is inaccurate. \n14.  I have personally seen flights land and take off at the airport.  They are, quite \nobviously, very loud.  Because the surrounding land is flat and there are no nearby buildings, the \nsound tends to reverberate well beyond the airport itself.  In my experience, the sound of planes \nlanding at and taking off from the airport would be loud enough to jolt most humans, let alone \nsurrounding wildlife.  \n15.  Since FDEM has assumed control of the airport, about two to three flights land or \ntake off from the airport each day, though there are days when no flights land or take off.  Flight \ntraffic at the airport has thus decreased approximately 98% since the detention facility opened \nbased on the flight data discussed above. \n16.  Turning to the facility’s grounds, there were structures at the site even before the \ndetention facility was built.  The airport has two buildings on-site.  These buildings have outdoor \nlights that are lit 24/7 and are bright enough to light both the buildings and the surrounding area.  \nThe airport also has runway lights that would turn on during night landings and take offs.  \n17.  The  detention  facility  contains  several  types  of  structures,  including  tarped \ndetention tents, lights, generators, fencing, and paved roads.  Each of those pieces of infrastructure \nare critical to secure the safety of both the facility’s detainees and operators.  Importantly, all \n6 \nApp.44\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 7 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 74 of 226 \ninfrastructure at the facility is temporary and can be removed once FDEM’s operations cease at \nthe airport. \n18.  FDEM has worked hard to ensure that the facility does not inadvertently harm the \nsurrounding environment.  It has instituted a rigorous waste-management policy that ensures waste \nis securely removed from the facility daily.  Ex. 8.  It has paved exclusively over land that was \npreviously filled and leveled when the airport was first built in the 1970s.  It has installed new silt \nfencing—black plastic fencing designed to block sediment runoff—around newly paved areas to \nstop debris or other materials from inadvertently falling into the surrounding wetlands.  Ex. 9 \n(identifying areas in which silt fencing has been installed).  And, at least until the Court entered a \ntemporary restraining order barring further construction of infrastructure at the site, FDEM was \nbuilding a drainage basin to provide further protection for surrounding wetlands.  That work is \nnow on hold to comply with the Court’s order.   \n19.  FDEM  has  also  endeavored  to  ensure  that  the  detention  facility  does  not \nmeaningfully affect local wildlife.  It commissioned a preliminary study that determined there \nwould not be meaningful impacts on species native to the area, like panther, bonneted bat, wood \nstork, or snail kite.  Ex. 10.  It has also installed roughly forty speed bumps along the preexisting \nservice road leading to the airport’s main gate to slow the speed of traffic, as reflected in the \nattached picture, which I took.  Ex. 11.  The speed limit on many roads in and surrounding the \nairport is 15 MPH, which further mitigates any effect additional traffic will have on the area.  In \nall events, the preexisting service road leading to the airport was traveled even before the detention \nfacility was built, as it was used by training pilots to reach the airport.  And State Road 41—which \nvehicles must travel across to reach the facility—has long been a heavily used road, as it connects \nthe east and west portions of the State. \n7 \nApp.45\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 8 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 75 of 226 \n20.  As for the facility’s origins, the facility was developed by the State to assist in \nenforcing federal immigration law.  FDEM has considered TNT as a possible staging area for the \nState’s response to a South Florida hurricane given its location and active runway, so it was a \nnatural fit for responding to the illegal immigration emergency.  So far as I am aware, at no point \ndid federal officials order the State to construct the site, nor did Florida seek federal permission to \nbuild the site.   \n21.  To that end, the facility was entirely State constructed.  It was built pursuant to the \nemergency powers Governor DeSantis conferred to FDEM in his orders declaring a statewide \nillegal immigration emergency.  And it was constructed by state-paid vendors and funded solely \nwith state dollars.  The only federal involvement with the construction process at the site was a \npost-construction compliance check by ICE to ensure the site met federal standards for housing \nfederal immigration detainees.  It is my understanding that ICE ran the same compliance check \nthat it runs for other state facilities that house federal immigration detainees, like county jails and \ncorrectional facilities.  \n22.  FDEM does not know whether FEMA will reimburse state funding used for the \nfacility, how much  funding FEMA may provide, or how long it will take FEMA to issue \nreimbursement.   \n23.  FDEM and its sister state agencies—including Florida Department of Corrections; \nFlorida Department of Business & Professional Regulation, Division of Alcoholic Beverages and \nTobacco; Florida Department of Law Enforcement; Florida Department of Financial Services; \nFlorida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, Division of Highway Patrol; Florida \nWildlife Conservation Commission; Florida Department of Environmental Protection; Florida \n8 \nApp.46\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 9 of 48\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 76 of 226 \nLottery; Florida National Guard; and Florida State Guard—operate the site with assistance from \nFDEM’s vendors. \n24. On any given day, there are about 115 state officials and between 800-1000 state \ncontractorscarrying out various activities at the site.  In comparison, there are just four ICE officers\npresent for the limited purpose of coordinating the transportation and physical custody of the \ndetainees.  The ICE officers do not control the site, nor do they have any infrastructure on site.  \nConstruction and day-to-day maintenance of the site is handled exclusively by state officials. \n25. Because the State operates this facility of its own volition, it has significant control \nover whom it houses there.  For example, the State may turn down detainees from the federal \ngovernment.  If the State no longer wishes to hold a detainee, it can require the federal government \nto reassume custody.  The State has in fact declined to hold entire classes of persons, including \nwomen, children, and illegal aliens of high medical risk, though it could choose to house those \nindividuals in its discretion.  If so, they would be separated from the general, adult male population.\n26. Given my experience with the facility, I am aware that many illegal aliens at the \nfacility are violent criminals with dangerous criminal records.  I am also aware that manyof these\nillegal aliens were apprehended in Florida before they wereplaced inthis facility.\nExecuted on August 11, 2025, in Tallahassee, Florida. \n

The  goal  of  the  Division  and \ncontracted vendors is to ensure a robust, proactive logistics and installation plan that fully eliminates the potential \nfor environmental issues related to waste production, solid waste management, recycling, construction and \ndemolition debris, and potable water management for all on-site restroom, shower, and laundry trailers by \nintegrating high-capacity containment, secure plumbing, secondary spill containment, solid waste management, \nrecycling, construction and demolition debris handling, and robust monitoring, this plan addresses and eliminates \nenvironmental risks, ensuring compliance and safe conditions for site occupants.  \nMonitoring, Evaluation and Compliance \nOn-site personnel will monitor biowaste and solid waste storage, potable water systems, dumpster, recycling, and \nC&D debris areas for leaks, spills, overflow, or contamination. Preventive maintenance schedules will be followed, \nincluding pump-outs of frac tanks and timely waste, recycling, and debris hauling. All procedures will comply with \nfederal, state, and local environmental regulations. \nWastewater and Potable Water \nWastewater \nShower, restroom, and laundry units, as well as administrative and billeting trailers produce graywater, blackwater, \nand lint waste. Each waste-producing trailer will be hard-plumbed directly to designated 22,000-gallon frac tanks, \nreducing frequency of tank exchanges and minimizing transfer points. Frac tanks will be maintained at less than \n50% of capacity. To secure connection points, all waste discharge lines will utilize 2-inch camlock connections. All \nconnection points, hoses, and storage tanks will be within containment trays for spill protection. A trained team will \ninspect all plumbing and containment systems daily to maintain zero environmental impact.  \nPotable Water  \nPotable water will be delivered by 2,000-gallon and 6,000-gallon tanker trucks and transferred via secure plumbing \nto ensure safe transport and storage. To provide sealed connections, all potable water hookups will use 2-inch \ncamlock fittings for a closed system. Water tanks will be sanitized, flushed, and water quality tested regularly. \nSolid Waste\nAppropriately sized roll-off dumpsters will be strategically placed throughout the site to handle all solid waste \ngenerated by operations and personnel. All dumpsters will be equipped with lids or tarps to prevent littering, wind \ndispersal, and animal intrusion. Dumpsters will be placed on stable ground with adequate clearance for truck \naccess. A daily swap schedule for removal and replacement will be maintained to prevent overflow and ensure \nsite cleanliness. Waste haulers will be responsible for safe transport and disposal at permitted facilities. \nRecycling \nClearly marked recycling containers will be placed next to general waste dumpsters and throughout common \nareas to encourage source separation of recyclable materials. Materials such as cardboard, plastic, metal, and \npaper will be collected separately to reduce contamination and maximize recycling efficiency. A dedicated \nrecycling hauler will collect and transport recyclable materials to an approved recycling facility on a routine \nschedule. \nApp.76Exhibit 2 to Declaration of Eve Samples\n\nCCasaes e1 :12:52-5c-vc-v2-22829869-6K-JMEWM      DDooccuummeenntt  151-16 - 1 E   nEtenrteedre odn o FnL FSLDS DD oDcokcekt e0t6 0/287/1/220/22052  5 P   aPgaeg 8e  o3f9 8 of\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20 4  8  Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 106 of 226 \nC&D Debris Management \nDedicated roll-off containers will be provided specifically for construction and demolition debris to avoid mixing \nwith general waste and recyclables.

Rodriguez, Lemoine CDR Logistics\nFROM: Tom Roberts\nCOPIES:\nSUBJECT Everglades Detention Center Preliminary Ecological Assessment\nDATE: August 04, 2025\nPROJECT NUMBER: PRJ113094\nThe Florida Divisionof Emergency Management(FDEM) began construction of the Everglades Detention Center (EDC) also \nknown as “Alligator Alcatraz” on June 25, 2025. EDC is entirely situated within the Dade-Collier Training and Transition \nAirport (DCTTA) located at 54575 East Tamiami Trail, Ochopee, Collier County, Florida. For the purposes of this evaluation, \nthe project area, including the existing DCTTA and an additional 500-foot buffer, was assessed to determine potential \nenvironmental impacts. This preliminary ecological evaluation is based on a database review of the project area and a site \nvisit conducted by Resource Environmental Solutions, LLC (RES)staff on July 29, 2025.\nExisting Conditions\nDCTTA is centrally located within an approximately 4700-acre parcel owned by Dade County. Florida Land Use and Cover \nClassification System (FLUCCS) data was used to determine land use in the project area. Land use within or adjacent to the \nDCTTA includes Upland Hardwood Forests (FUCCS 420), Reservoirs (FLUCCS 530), Cypress (FLUCCS 621), Wetland Scrub \n(FLUCCS 631), Freshwater/Prairie Marsh (FLUCCS 641), and Airports (FLUCCS 811).DCTTA was historically constructed as the \nBig Cypress Swamp Jetport in 1968to accommodate supersonic aircraft including the Boeing 2707, also known as the Boeing \nSST (Supersonic Transport). Much of the airport footprint was cleared and filled, with runways and some roadways paved. \nFilled areas not paved were maintained through mowing. The airport currently includes one 10,499-foot-long runway that \nis 150 feet wide, witha parallel taxiway 75 feet wide. \nThe EDC footprint is located entirely within the DCTTAland use area that was filled in 1968 and has been maintained since \nthat time. Two grass-covered areas were graded, stabilizedwith additional road base,andtopped by asphalt. The first isan \napproximately 8-acre area south of the former aircraft parking apron, now used for the detention facility and supporting \nservices. The secondisan approximately 30-acre area near the west end of the runway, currently used for employee badging \nand parking.In addition to the newly added structures, numerous generators are in operationto power the facility,including \nnumerous portable lights. \nWetlands and SurfaceWaters\nThe areas modified to facilitate operation of the EDC were inspected to determine if work had been conducted outside of \nthe original airport footprint. Current and historic aerials were reviewed prior to the site visit on July 29, 2025. Based on this \nreview and field observations, no direct impacts to wetland areas were identified. Best Management Practices (BMPs) for \nwork near wetlands appear to have been implemented. Most work occurred at least 25 feet from wetlands, though some \nareas were as close as 15 feet.  To minimize potential secondary or indirect impacts, silt fencing and metal fencing were \ninstalled. Silt fence helps reduce turbidity and prevents stormwater runoff and associated contaminants from entering the \nwetland areas. Metal fencing restrictshuman access and limitswindblown trash and debris. Regular removal of effluent and\ncastoff potable water reducesthe likelihood of leaks and provides for regular inspections of those systems.\nApp.81\nAugust 04, 2025| 1\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 44 of\nEvergladeUs SDeCtenAti1on1 C Cenatesre: 25-12873     Document: 20 4  8  Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 111 of 226 \nPreliminary Ecological Assessment\nRES Project Number 113094\nProtected Species\nA literature and historic aerial review were conducted to identify those species classified by the United States Fish and \nWildlife Service (USFWS)and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC)as being Endangered or Threatened \n(collectively recognized as “protected species”) within the DCTTA. In addition to the literature review, species lists were \nobtained using the USFWS Information for Planning and Consultation (IPaC) web-based mapping tool. The IPaC database \nindicates there are 10 federally protected wildlife species: Florida bonneted bat(Eumops floridanus), Florida panther(Puma \nconcolor coryi), crested caracara (Caracara plancus), Eastern black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis jamaicensis), Everglade snail \nkite(Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus), red-cockaded woodpecker(Leuconotopicus borealis), wood stork(Mycteria americana), \nAmerican alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and monarch butterfly (Danaus \nplexippus). There is also the potential for two plant species to occur: Florida prairie-clover (Dalea carthagenensis var. \nfloridana) and Garber’s spurgewith(Chamaesyce garberi). The project is not located within an area designated by the USFWS \nas critical habitat. \nThe project area is located within the Big Cypress National Preserve, established on October 11, 1974, as the nation’s first \nnational preserve. However, direct impacts and many of the secondary impacts occurred earlier, during the construction of \nthe Big Cypress Swamp Jetport in 1968. Inspection of these areas on July 29, 2025 confirmed that no additional impacts to \npreviously natural habitat resulted from modifications initiated in June 2025. Therefore, the following protected species \nsecondary/indirect impact assessment is considered preliminary and subject to change as further research and literature \nreviews are conducted.\nEastern Black Rail\nThe Eastern black rail is listed by the USFWS as Threatened due to habitat loss, destruction, and modification; sea level rise \nand tidal flooding; and incompatible land management. They are wetland-dependent birds and are primarily associated \nwith herbaceous, persistent emergentplant cover. They require dense overhead perennial herbaceous cover with \nunderlying moist to saturated soils with or adjacent to very shallow water. Nosuitable Eastern black rail habitat was \nimpacted by theproject. However, potential suitable habitat may exist adjacent to the project area, but further assessment \nis needed. Until that assessment is complete,potential indirect impacts cannot be fully determined,and an effects \ndetermination cannot be made.\nCrested Caracara\nCrested caracara is a large species of raptor that is listed as Threatened by the USFWS. They have a dark brown to black \nbelly, wings and back with a white lower belly, head and throat.  Their bill is bluish gray to white, red facial skin and a white \ntail.  This species inhabits wet prairies with cabbage palms but may also be found in wooded areas with saw palmetto, \ncypress, and scrub oaks. They will also inhabit pastures.  None of this habitat was impacted by the project.  Further review \nwill determine if a “no effect” a “may affect, or not likely to adversely affect” determination may be justified.\nFlorida Bonneted Bat\nBonneted bats are known to roost in both natural and artificial structures with potential roosting structures. Natural roosting \nsites may includemature live or dead trees, snags, and trees with cavities, hollows, or crevices. Artificial roosting structures \nmay include rock crevices, buildings, bridges, utility poles, and bat houses. Potential bonneted bat roosting trees include \nthose that are equal to or greater than 34 feet tall and snags equal to or greater than 28 feet tall with a Diameter at Breast \nHeight (DBH) equal to or greater than 7.4 inches. Artificial structures equal to or greater than 15 feet in height can also be \nconsidered potential bonneted bat roosting structures. Foraging habitat for bonneted bats is characterized by relatively \nopen (e.g. few obstacles) areas with prey sources and water. Examples of bonneted bat foraging habitats include open fresh \nwater, permanent or seasonal freshwater wetlands, wetlands and upland forests, wetland and upland shrubs, agricultural \nlands, golf courses, parking lots, parks, and relatively small patches of natural habitat. No trees and no structures were \nremoved within the project area so there were no direct impacts to roosting structures. Indirect impacts are still being \nevaluated but there are two main factors to be considered: lights and noise. It is anticipated that the additional lighting will \nbring more insects to the area for foraging. The effects of current noise levels on bat echolocation to navigate and find food \nin the darkhavenot been determined. However, this species is known to do well in urban environments. Therefore,a “may \naffect, not likely to adversely affect” determination may be justified.\nApp.82\nAugust 04, 2025| 2\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 45 of\nEvergladeUs SDeCtenAti1on1 C Cenatesre: 25-12873     Document: 20 4  8  Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 112 of 226 \nPreliminary Ecological Assessment\nRES Project Number 113094\nEverglade Snail Kite\nThe Everglade snail kite, listed as endangered by the USFWS, is a mid-sized raptor that can reach a length of 14.2-15.4 \ninches.  Males are slate gray with red eyes and orange legs, which turn more reddish during breeding season.  Females are \nbrown with red eyes and yellow to orange legs, with varying amounts of white streaking on the face, neck, and chest.  The \nEverglade snail kite feeds almost exclusively on apple snails (Pomacea), which are captured at or near the water’s surface.  \nSnail kites hunt for snails by flying slowly or perching over sparsely vegetated lake shores or marshes and grabbing snails \nwith their feet that are within six inches of the water’s surface.  There were no direct impacts to snail kite habitat. However, \nthere may be potential suitable habitat adjacent to the project area, but further assessment is needed. Until that assessment\nis complete potential indirect effects cannot be determined at this time.    \nWood Stork\nThe wood stork isa long-legged wader and a large bodied white bird with black in the wings and tail. Wood storks nest in \ncolonies in a variety of inundated forested wetlands such as cypress swamps, sloughs or mangroves.  Foraging habitat \nincludes shallow freshwater marshes, ponds, ditches or pastures.  The USFWS and FWClist the wood stork as Threatened.  \nThe project areais located within two miles of four different documented wood stork colonies. However, the current \nactivity status of these colonies has not been determined.  No wood storks were observed during the site visit and there \nwere no direct impacts to wood stork foraging habitat.  However, potential secondary impacts from the adjacent facility, \nsuch as increased lighting, human activity, and noise, may have indirect effects on nearby foraging or nesting behavior. \nWhile these effects are expected to be minimal given the absence of suitable habitat within the project area, proximity to \nmultiple wood stork coloniesjustifies a “may affect, not likely to adversely affect” determination for the wood stork, \npending further coordination and review.\nEastern Indigo Snake\nThe Eastern indigo snakeis listed by both the USFWS and FWC as Threatened.  This large, stout-bodied, shiny black snake \ncan reach 8 feet in length and will utilize a wide range of habitats from scrub and sandhills to wetlands throughout Florida.\nThey are known to winter in gopher tortoise burrows.  Eastern indigo snakes require large tracts of natural land to survive, \ntypically foraging in more hydric habitats. The altered and maintained infield at DCTTA did not provide refuge for this species \nprior to the modifications. Therefore, no direct impacts are anticipated. Indirect effects could include noise and light pollution \ninto the adjacent habitat, however, there may also be beneficial effects such as an increase in rodent population due to \nhuman presence. Because of the potential of indirect impacts to potential foraging habitat a “may affect, not likely to \nadversely affect” determination may be justified.\nFlorida Panther\nThe Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), listed by the USFWS as endangered, is a large, long-tailed cat with a great deal \nof color variation: pale brown or rusty upper parts, dull white or buffy under parts; tail tip, back of ears, and sides of nose \nare dark brown or blackish. Florida panthers occur in peninsular Florida primarily south of Orlando.  They will use all habitat \ntypes to some degree but rely upon forested areas that provide dense understory vegetation for rest sites, den sites and \nstalking cover.Suitable panther habitat was not impacted by the project and no panthers have been documented within the \nproject area. While traffic has increased within the project area, the speed limit is 15 miles per hour (mph) through most of\nthe area with some small stretches of 35 mph along the entryroad. However, much of this is fenced and there are frequent \nspeed bumps to dampen speed. Based on this a “may affect, not likely to adversely affect” determination may be justified.\nRed-Cockaded Woodpecker\nRed-cockaded Woodpecker (RCW) require mature,open-canopy longleaf pine or slash pine forest fornesting and foraging \nhabitat. This habitat is not present in the project area, therefore there will be “no effect” on this species. \nMonarch Butterfly\nThis large colorful butterfly that is identified by its orange and black markings is a Candidate species but has not yet been\nlisted or proposed for listing by the USFWS.  Monarch butterfly habitat includes roadsides and open fields which are available \nwithin the airport infield. If the listing status of the monarch butterfly is elevated by USFWS, consultation with the USFWS to \ndetermine potential effects can be initiated at that time. Therefore, impacts to thisspecies arenot anticipated.\nApp.83\nAugust 04, 2025| 3\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 116-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 46 of\nEvergladeUs SDeCtenAti1on1 C Cenatesre: 25-12873     Document: 20 4  8  Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 113 of 226 \nPreliminary Ecological Assessment\nRES Project Number 113094\nAmerican alligator\nAfter being legally protected for many years, the alligator, listed by the USFWS as Threatened (due to similarity of \nappearance), has made a remarkable comeback, and is now common in areas that will support it. Alligators can be found in \nmost types of wetlands that have standing water and ample food supplies. No alligator habitat was impacted by the project. \nTherefore, it is anticipated that the project will have “no effect” on the species.\nProtected Plants\nTwofederally protected plant species, Florida prairie-cloverand Garber’s spurgewith havethe potential to occur \nwithin habitats found adjacent to the project area.

I have been the AFOD of ERO Miami since 2024. \n2.  As the AFOD, I oversee the Criminal Alien Program (CAP), ERO Criminal Prosecutions \n(ECP), and 287(g) programs for the Miami area of responsibility.  \n3.  I began my federal career in June 2003 as a clerk with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices in the Miami office. In February 2004, I was a Customs and Border Protection Officer in \nMiami, Florida. In March 2006, I entered on duty with ICE as an Immigration Enforcement Agent and \nwas promoted to Deportation Officer and then Supervisory Detention and Deportation Officer in 2016.  \n4.  I am familiar with the allegations made by plaintiffs in the instant lawsuit regarding the \nSouth Florida Soft-Sided Facility South detention center (SFSSFS). \nOverview of the 287(g) Program \n5.  Since 1996, 8 U.S.C. § 1357 (g) has authorized ICE to delegate immigration enforcement \nauthority to state and local law enforcement by way of an agreement between the state law \nenforcement  agency  and  ICE,  to  perform  certain  immigration  functions  as  outlined  in  the \nagreement.  Practically  this  means  that  local  law  enforcement  can  perform  immigration \nenforcement actions under the direction and supervision of ICE.  \n6.  The purpose of the 287(g) program is to enhance the safety and security of communities \nby identifying and processing for removal criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety or a \ndanger to the community. This collaboration fosters better communication between federal and \nstate/local law enforcement agencies. This coordinated enforcement effort allows for the swift and \nsafe removal of dangerous criminal aliens.  \n7.  ICE implemented the first 287(g) agreement in 2002. Since then, to participate in the 287(g) \nprogram,  local  law  enforcement  officers  must  be  nominated  by  a  chief  officer  of  the  law \nenforcement agency, must have at least two years of law enforcement work experience, complete \na training and certification program, be approved by ICE, and be able to qualify for appropriate \n \nApp.88\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 118-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 3 of 6\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 118 of 226 \nfederal security clearances. The mandatory training focuses on relevant administrative, legal, and \noperational issues tailored to the immigration enforcement functions to be performed, followed by \nan  examination.  Officers  who  are  nominated  and  successfully  complete  the  training  and \ncertification are authorized to participate in the 287(g) program for a period of two years from the \ndate of authorization. After this, local training on relevant issues are provided on an ongoing basis \nby ICE supervisors or a designated team leader.   \n8.  There  are  currently  167  Florida  entities  that  have  entered  287(g)  agreements  since \nPresident Trump took office, including the Florida National Guard and several Florida law \nenforcement entities.  \n9.  Since 2024, I have overseen the 287(g) agreements in the Miami area of responsibility.  \nThose agreements, including the date they were signed, are available on ICE’s website. The \nagreements generally authorize those entities to detain aliens under federal immigration laws.  \n10.  287(g)  agreements  have  several  different  models,  the  Task  Force  Model,  the  Jail \nEnforcement Model and Warrant Service Officer model. The Task Force Model authorizes \ndesignated state or local law enforcement officers to perform immigration enforcement functions \nin the field, such as during patrols or traffic stops, allowing them to question individuals about \nimmigration status and initiate removal proceedings outside of a custodial setting. In contrast, the \nJail Enforcement Model limits these functions to the secure environment of a jail or correctional \nfacility, where trained officers screen individuals already under arrest to determine immigration \nstatus, lodge detainers, and commence removal proceedings. The Warrant Service Officer Model \nrestricts designated officers to serving ICE administrative warrants and detainers on individuals \nalready  in  their  custody,  without  granting  the  broader  investigative  or  processing  authority \navailable under the Jail Enforcement Model.  \nImplementation of 287(g) \n \nApp.89\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 118-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 4 of 6\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 119 of 226 \n11.  When a state enters into a 287(g) program, state and local law enforcement are given the \nauthority to serve and execute immigration administrative warrants of arrest, to arrest without a \nwarrant any alien entering or attempting to unlawfully enter the United States in the officers view, \nany alien unlawfully present in the United States with probable cause if the alien is likely to escape \nbefore a warrant can be obtained, or any person committing an immigration related felony with \nprobable cause if the alien is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. They may also \nprepare charging documents for the signature of an ICE officer, process arrested aliens for \nimmigration violations, issue immigration detainers, take and maintain custody of aliens arrested \nby ICE or another local law enforcement agency on behalf of ICE, and transport arrested aliens to \nICE approved facilities.  \n12.  DHS provides credentials and guidance to local law enforcement partners, and signs \nwarrants for service as needed. DHS is required to provide direction and supervision to local law \nenforcement officers when taking immigration enforcement actions.  \n13.  State and local law enforcement officers make the decision to detain an alien under the \nauthority given to them through the 287(g) agreements. DHS does not have the authority to order \nany state to detain an alien, however, DHS will confirm an alien is amenable to arrest and provide \ndirection  and  supervision  on  questions  of  immigration  law,  as  required  under  the  287(g) \nagreement. The authority to direct and supervise law enforcement officers acting under a 287(g) \nagreement in all matters aside from those described above, to include personnel and employment \nmatters and operational concerns pertaining to Florida detention facilities, are retained by the State \nof Florida. For example, the 287(g) law enforcement agency partner is responsible for providing \nofficer salaries, benefits, uniforms; responsible for all personnel decisions such as hiring, firing, \nand any disciplinary actions; sets work hours, manages officer assignments, assigns supervisors; \nand sets policies and procedures for their agency. \n \nApp.90\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 118-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2025   Page 5 of 6\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 120 of 226 \nSouth Florida Soft-Sided Facility South Detention Facility \n14. The SFSSFS detention facility is in Collier County, Florida. DHS and Collier County have\nhad a 287(g) agreement since 2007. This agreement confers federal immigration authority onto \nCollier County law enforcement officials per the terms of the agreement, as generally explained \nunder paragraph 11. \n15. Collier County currently has two 287(g) agreements, to include the Jail Enforcement Model\nand the Task Force Management model. \n16. When ICE procures detention space from a state or local entity, it pays for that space\nvia its appropriation for Operations and Support, which includes funding for enforcement, \ndetention and removal operations. When it does so, the aliens are detained by (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72) (cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)\n(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)on behalf of ICE.  \n17. ICE did not and has not purchased or otherwise procured any detention space from Florida\nfor the detention of illegal aliens at the SFSSFS detention facility. ICE did not and has not ordered, \nsupervised, or directed the construction of the facility. ICE did not and has not weighed in on the \nnumber of detainees to be held at the facility.  \n18. The State of Florida has complete discretion in deciding who is detained at this facility.\n19. ICE continues to provide supervision to local law enforcement at the SFSSFS detention\nfacility for delegated immigration officer functions as required under the 287(g) program. This \nincludes signing off on charging documents, reviewing detainers issued, running federal database \nsystem checks, and providing guidance any time immigration authority is exercised.  ICE did not \ndesignate or plan the site as a detention facility.  ICE does not direct or supervise construction or \nphysical maintenance activities at the SFSSFS detention facility. \n20.(cid:3) Deportation Officers normally assigned to various units throughout South Florida have(cid:3)\nbeen temporarily reassigned to intermittently (cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:3)work at the SFSSFS facility.

Termination by the LEA shall be provided, in writing, to \nthe local Field Office. \nIn instances where serious misconduct or violations ofthe terms ofthe MOA come to the attention \nofICE, the ICE Director may, upon recommendation ofthe Executive Associate Director for \nEnforcement and Removal Operations, elect to immediately suspend the MOA pending \ninvestigation of the misconduct and/or violations. \nNotice of the suspension will be provided to the LEA, and the notice will include, at a minimum, \n(1) an overview of the reason(s) that ICE is suspending the 287(g) agreement, (2) the length of the \ntemporary suspension, and (3) how the LEA can provide ICE with information regarding the alleged \nmisconduct and/or violations, as well as any corrective measures it has undertaken. \nApp.100\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 24-3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 9 of 14\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 130 of 226 \nICE shall provide the LEA with a reasonable opportunity to respond to the alleged misconduct \nand/or violations and to take actions to implement corrective measures (e.g., replace the officer(s) \nwho are the focus ofthe allegations). ICE will provide the LEA timely notice ofa suspension being \nextended or vacated. \nIf the LEA is working to take corrective measures, ICE will generally not terminate an agreement. \nThe termination of an agreement is generally reserved in instances involving problems that are \nunresolvable and detrimental to the 287(g) Program. \nIf ICE decides to move from suspension to termination, ICE will provide the LEA a 90-day notice \nin advance of the partnership being terminated. The notice will include, at a minimum: (1) An \noverview of the reason(s) that ICE seeks to terminate the 287(g) agreement; (2) All available data \non the total number ofaliens identified under the 287(g) agreement; and (3) Examples ofegregious \ncriminal aliens identified under the 287(g) agreement. ICE's decision to terminate a MOA will be \npublished on ICE's website 90 days in advance of the MOA's termination. \nThis MOA does not, is not intended to, shall not be construed to, and may not be relied upon to \ncreate any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any person in any matter, civil or \ncriminal. \nBy signing this MOA, each party represents it is fully authorized to enter into this MOA, accepts \nthe terms, responsibilities, obligations, and limitations ofthis MOA, and agrees to be bound thereto \nto the fullest extent allowed by law. \nFor the LEA:  For ICE: \nDate:  April 2, 2025\nSigna._tu_r_e_:_~----------=L---5--':-~  --\nTitle:  The Adjutant General  Title:__A_c_tin_g D_ire_ct_or______ \nApp.101\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 24-3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 10 of 14\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 131 of 226 \nAPPENDIX A \nPOINTS OF CONTACT \nThe ICE and LEA points of contact for purposes of implementation of this MOA are: \nDepartment of Homeland Security \nFor ICE: \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nEnforcement and Removal Operations \nAssistant Director for Enforcement Washington DC \nThe Adjutant General, MG John Haas, john.d.haas.mil@army.mil \nFor the LEA: \nState Aviation Officer, COL Brett Rhodenizer, brett.s.rhodenizer.mil@army.mil \nGeneral Counsel, Col Jeffrey Pozen, jeffrey.m.pozen.mil@arrny.mil \nApp.102\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 24-3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 11 of 14\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 132 of 226 \nAPPENDIXB \nCOMPLAINT PROCEDURE \nThis MOA is an agreement between ICE and the  , hereinafter \nreferred to as the \"Law Enforcement Agency\" (LEA),  in  which  selected  LEA personnel \nare authorized to perform immigration enforcement duties in specific situations under federal \nauthority. As such, the training, supervision, and performance ofparticipating LEA personnel \npursuant to the MOA,  as well as the protections for  individuals'  civil  and constitutional \nrights, are to be monitored.  Part of that monitoring will  be accomplished  through these \ncomplaint reporting and resolution procedures, which the parties to the MOA have agreed \nto follow. \nIf any participating LEA personnel are the subject of a complaint or allegation involving the \nviolation of the terms of this MOA the LEA shall, to the extent allowed by state law, make \ntimely notification to ICE. \nFurther, if the LEA is aware of a complaint or allegation of any sort that may result in that \nindividual  receiving  professional  discipline  or  becoming  the  subject  of  a  criminal \ninvestigation or civil lawsuit, the LEA shall remove the designated LEA personnel from the \nprogram, until such time that the LEA has adjudicated the allegation. \nThe LEA will handle complaints filed against LEA personnel who are not designated and \ncertified pursuant to this MOA but are acting in immigration functions in violation of this \nMOA.  Any such complaints regarding non-designated LEA personnel acting in immigration \nfunctions  must be forwarded to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) at \nICEOPRlntake@ice.dhs.gov. \n1.  Complaint Reporting Procedures \nComplaint reporting procedures shall be disseminated as appropriate by the LEA within \nfacilities under its jurisdiction (in English and other languages as appropriate) in order to \nensure that individuals are aware of the availability of such procedures. Complaints will be \naccepted from any source ( e.g., ICE, LEA, participating LEA personnel, inmates, and the \npublic). \nComplaints may be reported to federal authorities as follows: \nA.  Telephonically to the ICE OPR at the toll-free number  l-833-4ICE-OPR; or \nB.  Via email at ICEOPRintake@ice.dhs.gov. \nComplaints may also be referred to and accepted by any of the following LEA entities: \nA.  The LEA Internal Affairs Division; or \nB.  The supervisor of any participating LEA personnel. \nRevised 02/12/2025 \nApp.103\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 24-3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 12 of 14\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 133 of 226 \n2.  Review of Complaints \nAll  complaints  (written  or oral)  reported  to  the LEA  directly,  which  involve activities \nconnected to  immigration  enforcement  activities  authorized  under  this MOA,  will  be \nreported to the ICE OPR.  The ICE  OPR will verify participating personnel status under \nthe  MOA  with  the assistance of ICE.  Complaints  received  by any  ICE entity  will  be \nreported directly to the ICE OPR as per existing ICE policies and procedures. \nIn all instances, the ICE OPR, as appropriate, will make an initial determination regarding \nDHS investigative jurisdiction and refer the complaint to the appropriate office for action as \nsoon as possible, given the nature ofthe complaint. \nComplaints reported directly to the ICE OPR will be shared with the LEA's Internal Affairs \nDivision when the complaint involves LEA personnel.  Both offices will then coordinate \nappropriate investigative jurisdiction, which may include initiation of a joint investigation to \nresolve the issue(s). \n3.  Complaint Resolution Procedures \nUpon  receipt of any complaint  the ICE OPR will  undertake  a complete review of each \ncomplaint in accordance with existing ICE allegation criteria and reporting requirements. As \nstated above the ICE OPR will adhere to existing ICE reporting requirements as they relate \nto the OHS OIG and/or another legally required entity.  Complaints will be resolved using \nthe existing procedures, supplemented as follows: \nA. Referral of Complaints to LEA Internal Affairs Division. \nThe ICE OPR will refer complaints, as appropriate, involving LEA  personnel  to the \nLEA's  Internal  Affairs  Division  for  resolution.  The  Internal  Affairs  Division \nCommander will inform ICE OPR ofthe disposition and resolution of any complaints \nreferred by ICE OPR. \nB. Interim Action Pending Complaint Resolution \nWhenever any  participating  LEA personnel are  under investigation and subject to \ninterrogation by the LEA for any reason that could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, \nor dismissal,  the  policy  requirements  of the  LEA  shall  he honored.  If appropriate, \nan individual may he removed from participation in the activities covered  under the \nMOA pending resolution of an inquiry. \nC. Time Parameters for Resolution of Complaints \nIt is expected that any complaint received will be resolved within 90 days.  However, \nthis will depend  upon  the  nature and  complexity of the substance of the complaint \nitself. \nApp.104\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-JEM   Document 24-3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/03/2025   Page 13 of 14\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 134 of 226 \nD.

But if we're just balancing -- if we're in the harm, \n3 at the end of the day, if they're going to show harm, they \n4 can't just say, well, we could have known harm if you did the \n5 NEPA but you didn't and therefore we get NEPA. \n6 They have to say, here is the harm.  That is a Winter \n7 factor and they have to bring the evidence forward.\n8 THE COURT:  Okay.\n9 MR. PANUCCIO:  Let me make -- I have my final point, \n10 Your Honor, and it is very brief.  And that is if, and I don't \n11 think the Court would do this, but if the Court enters a \n12 preliminary injunction, I think it's fair to say that either \n13 side may appeal this decision either way.  \n14 I would like to put forth now our request for a stay \n15 pending appeal.  It's all of the same factors we just went \n16 through, likelihood of success, irreparable harm.  I think my \n17 argument would be much the same.  So, if the Court were to \n18 issue a preliminary injunction, we would ask that the stay be \n19 adjudicated in that same order, if possible, to streamline \n20 things.  Although, let me wishcast, Your Honor, and say we hope \n21 that eventuality doesn't come around because I think we have \n22 shown there is no entitlement to a preliminary injunction. \n23 THE COURT:  I'm not going to give -- I haven't even \n24 decided this yet, so I won't give an advisory opinion.  But \n25 should either side, I don't think they would, but if a stay is \nApp.107\n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date  Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 137 of 226 129\n1 requested, I would like that in writing.  But you can reference \n2 all of the arguments that you have set forth here and in the \n3 papers that you've submitted.  \n4 MR. PANUCCIO:  Great.  \n5 Thank you, Your Honor.  Thank you for your indulgence \n6 on time.  I probably went over.  I appreciate you letting me \n7 get through the whole presentation. \n8 THE COURT:  All right.  But let's take -- since we are \n9 going to hear a little further, let's just take a five-minute \n10 break for everyone.  \n11 Are we still okay on -- \n12 MR.

GUSTAFSON:  Yes, thank you.  \n16 (Recess.)  \n17 THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Schwiep, are you doing \n18 rebuttal for both the Tribe and the Friends?  \n19 MR. SCHWIEP:  No, Your Honor.  I will just have the \n20 rebuttal for the plaintiffs Friends and Center for Biological \n21 Diversity.  And then the Tribe lawyers will enter their own \n22 rebuttal.  \n23 MR. AJIZIAN:  I have no more than two or three minutes. \n24 THE COURT:  Okay.  \n25 Do you have two to three minutes, Mr. Schwiep, or more?  \nApp.108\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 1 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 138 of 226 \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nCASE NO. 25-22896-CV-WILLIAMS \n \nFRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., et al., \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nKRISTI NOEM, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n                       / \n \nOMNIBUS ORDER \nTHIS MATTER is before the Court on Plaintiffs Friends of the Everglades, Inc. \n(“Friends”) and Center for Biological Diversity’s (“CBD”) (together, “Plaintiffs”) Expedited \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction (DE 5) (“Motion for Preliminary Injunction”). The Court \nwill also address Defendant Kevin Guthrie (the “State”) and Defendants Kristi Noem and \nTodd Lyons’ (together, “Federal Defendants”) venue challenges. (DE 50; DE 60; DE \n65).1 Both Motions are fully briefed.2 On July 30, 2025, the Parties presented oral \nargument on the State and Federal Defendants’ improper venue challenge, (DE 72) \n(“Hearing on Venue”), and on August 6, 7, 12, and 13, 2025, the Parties presented \nevidence and oral argument on the merits of Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.  \n1 Though Defendants’ venue challenges were advanced in the form of supplemental \nbriefings  to  Plaintiffs’  Renewed  Motion  for  TRO,  the  Court  “will  treat  Defendants’ \nresponse[s] as a 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss based on ‘improper venue.’” Doe 1 v. Bondi, \n-- F. Supp. 3d --, 2025 WL 1482733, at *4 (N.D. Ga. May 2, 2025).  \n2 All Defendants responded in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \n(DE 12; DE 16; DE 21), and Plaintiffs replied (DE 24). Plaintiffs also replied to Defendants’ \nimproper venue Motions. (DE 61; DE 66). \nApp.109\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 2 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 139 of 226 \n(DE 102; DE 103; DE 119; DE 121 (together, the “Preliminary Injunction Hearing”)). \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that venue in the Southern District of \nFlorida (“S.D. Fla.”) is proper as to the State and Federal Defendants, and the Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction (DE 5) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. \nI.  BACKGROUND  \nAccording to the Complaint, on June 23, 2025, the Florida Division of Emergency \nManagement (“FDEM”) took control of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport \n(“TNT”), in order to construct a mass migrant detention and deportation camp. (DE 1 ¶¶ \n1, 39).3 Two days later, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that the detention \ncenter was requested and would be fully funded by the federal government. (Id. ¶ 35). \nPre-construction and construction activities at TNT began that week, (Id. ¶¶ 40–42), \naccording to Plaintiffs, without any environmental assessment or impact statement having \nbeen prepared. (Id. ¶ 43).  \nThe TNT site is located within the Big Cypress National Preserve (“BCNP”) and \nthe Big Cypress Area, which the Florida legislature has designated as “an area of critical \nstate concern” with the intention to “conserve and protect the [area’s] natural resources \nand scenic beauty.” Fla. Stat. § 380.055(1)–(2); (DE 1 ¶¶ 21–22). The project site is \n“within  an  environmentally  sensitive  freshwater  wetland  ecosystem  of  ecological \nsignificance for wildlife,” such as the “threatened wood stork, and the endangered Florida \nbonneted bat and the Florida panther.” (DE 1 ¶ 23). The site is also “near Everglades \nNational Park and part of the historic Everglades,” and within the footprint of the Western \n3 Throughout this Order, the Court will refer to the detention facility at the TNT site as \n“facility” or “camp.” The Court declines to use the moniker “Alligator Alcatraz.” \nApp.110\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 3 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 140 of 226 \nEverglades Restoration Plan (“WERP”). (Id. ¶¶ 29, 32). The WERP is part of a multi-billion \ndollar joint federal-state effort to “restor[e], preserv[e], and “protect[] the South Florida \necosystem,” and uses a complex network of active and passive water management \nfeatures to “re-establish ecological connectivity, reduce the severity and frequency of \nwildfires, and restore low nutrient conditions” in the Western Everglades. (Id. ¶¶ 29–32). \nAccording to Plaintiffs, the detention camp’s construction and operation risks harming the \nwetlands, wildlife, aquifer, and air and water quality in this sensitive area, and degrading \nthe “natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral, and faunal, and recreational values for which the \nPreserve was created.” (Id. ¶ 58).   \nOn June 27, 2025, non-profit environmental organizations Friends and CBD filed \nthis suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the camp’s construction and \noperation until the project complied with federal, state, and local laws. (Id. ¶¶ 1, 8, 13). \nMost notably, Plaintiffs claim the project is being built and operated in violation of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), which requires that major federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the human environment undergo environmental review processes. \n(Id. ¶¶ 61–74) (Count I). Because no such review had been done, Plaintiffs claim, the \napproval and use of the camp by the United States Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”),  including  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  (“ICE”),  should  be  held \nunlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). (Id. ¶¶ 75–79) (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701 et seq.) (Count II). Plaintiffs further claim the State’s participation in the project \nthrough FDEM exceeds the department’s authority under Florida Statutes Chapters 252 \nand 944. (Id. ¶¶ 80–87) (Count III). Finally, Plaintiffs allege Defendant Miami-Dade County \n(“Miami-Dade”) unlawfully acquiesced in allowing its property, TNT, to be used as a \nApp.111\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 4 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 141 of 226 \ndetention camp without the proper permitting and in violation of county code. (Id. ¶¶ 88–\n94) (Count IV). The case was initially assigned to another judge in this district. (DE 2).  \nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction (DE 5), \nrequesting that the Court enjoin the State and the Federal Defendants from developing \nor using the TNT site as an immigration detention camp “unless and until Defendants \ncomply with NEPA and the APA.” (DE 5 at 1–2, 14).4 Within the following week, all \nDefendants responded, challenging Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, (DE 12; \nDE 16; DE 21), inter alia, and Plaintiffs replied. (DE 24). No Defendant raised venue as \nan issue. \nThe State’s response included an affidavit from Keith Pruett, the FDEM Deputy \nExecutive Director, stating that Florida is funding the project, though it expects to seek \nreimbursement from the federal government, and that the project’s environmental impact \nis likely to be minimal,5 as TNT was already an active airfield with two buildings on site lit \n4 In their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs also requested that the Court enjoin \nthe State and Federal Defendants “from authorizing or permitting further development or \nuse of the TNT [s]ite for purposes related to a noncitizen detention center,” regardless of \nwhat procedures they follow. (DE 5 at 14). That request is apparently tied to Count III, \nwhich challenges the FDEM’s authority to build and operate a correctional camp. (DE 1 \n¶¶ 82–85). However, Plaintiffs did not develop any arguments nor provide any evidence \nrelated to Count III in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, their subsequent briefing, or \nduring the Preliminary Injunction Hearing. Therefore, Plaintiffs have waived this request. \nSee Fernandez v. Hotwire Commc’ns, Ltd., No. 21-cv-60115, 2022 WL 4598638, at *17 \n(S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2022) (holding plaintiffs had waived their disparate impact theory by \nfailing to advance any arguments on the issue at summary judgment (citing United States \nv. Campbell, 26 F.4th 860, 873 (11th Cir. 2022) (holding that the “failure to raise an issue \nin an initial brief . . . should be treated as a forfeiture of the issue”)). Similarly, Plaintiffs \ninitially  sought  injunctive  relief  against  Miami-Dade  but  subsequently  withdrew  that \nrequest. (DE 31 at 3 n.2). Consequently, the Court considers only Plaintiffs’ request for \nan injunction tied to their NEPA allegations.  \n5 Director Pruett’s declaration provided no background regarding his education, prior work \nexperience, or familiarity with environmental sciences, the Everglades ecosystem, or \nNEPA. (DE 16-1 at 2–3). It is entirely unclear in what capacity Director Pruett purports to \nApp.112\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 5 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 142 of 226 \n24-hours a day. (DE 16-1). For their part, the Federal Defendants attached declarations \nfrom Thomas Giles, Acting Deputy Executive Associate Director for ICE’s Enforcement \nand Removal Operations (“ERO”), (DE 21-1), and David Richardson, acting Administrator \nof the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”). (DE 21-2).6 Giles stated that \nICE’s role in the development of the detention camp has been “limited to touring the camp \nto ensure compliance with ICE detention standards, and meeting with officials from the \nState of Florida to discuss operational matters.” (DE 21-1 ¶ 5). He further declared Florida \nwould have final decision-making authority over who to detain at the camp, but that any \ndetentions at the camp would be pursuant to “section 287(g) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act [(“INA”)], codified at 8 U.S.C § 1357(g).” (Id. ¶¶ 6–7). Even so, Richardson \nadmitted  that  the  facility  would  be  funded  by  the  federal  government,  stating  that \n“DHS/FEMA announced $600 million in federal funding for the Detention Support Grant \nProgram [(“DSGP”)]” and that “[t]he only eligible applicant under the DSGP is [FDEM].” \n(DE 21-2 ¶ 3).  \nOver the next two weeks through July 16, 2025, the Parties filed notices with \nadditional affidavits and other evidence, and they made additional arguments on the \nmerits of Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction request. See (DE 14; DE 20; DE 25; DE 26;  \nDE 27; DE 34; DE 35; DE 38; DE 47; DE 48). This included two filings by the State, which, \nin part, reiterated its merits argument that “NEPA does not apply” to the TNT camp.  \npossess the knowledge required to determine the likely environmental impacts of a \ndetention center on the Everglades.  \n6 Throughout this Order, the Court will identify exhibits either through reference to their \ndocket entry numbers or their exhibit numbers on the Parties’ Final Lists of Admitted \nExhibits (DE 123; DE 124). When doing the latter, Plaintiffs’ exhibits will be identified as \n“Pl. Ex. #”, the Tribe’s exhibits as “Tribe Ex. #”, and Defendants’ exhibits as “D. Ex. #”. \nApp.113\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 6 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 143 of 226 \n(DE 28 at 2; DE 35 at 1 (“No matter how many times Plaintiffs poke and prod at the Court, \nthey  are  unable  to  show  their  complaint  presents  a  justiciable  controversy  under \nNEPA.”)). Still, no Defendant challenged or raised the question of venue.  \nAlso during that period, on July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of \nFlorida (“Tribe”) moved to intervene as plaintiffs based on its long-standing ties to the \nlands around TNT and the environmental risks the project poses to the Tribe’s food and \nwater supply.7 (DE 33). Then on July 16, 2026, the presiding judge recused from the \ncase, and it was reassigned to the undersigned. (DE 37).  \nThe next day, Plaintiffs filed a Renewed Motion for TRO, explaining that since they \nfiled  suit,  the  “State  and  Federal  Defendants  commenced  transporting  immigration \ndetainees to the TNT [s]ite,” that, according to State officials, “as many as 900 people are \nnow being detained at the [s]ite, and that the State has plans to expand the number of \ndetainees to as many as 4,000.” (DE 40 at 2). Given the completion of the detention \ncamp’s first phase of construction and its ongoing operations, Plaintiffs modified their \nrequest for injunctive relief, now seeking a “halt to any further construction on the TNT \n[s]ite . . ., [a] pause[ to] the transport of additional detainees to the [s]ite, and [the] ceasing \n[of] any operations related to detaining or preparing for the detention of anyone not \n[already] detained at the [s]ite[.]” (Id. at 6).     \nOn July 21, 2025, the State filed a Supplemental Response to Plaintiffs’ Requests \nfor a Temporary Restraining Order (“Supplemental Response on Venue”) arguing for \n7 Only the State opposed the Tribe’s intervention in the suit. See (DE 58; DE 59). The \nCourt granted the Tribe’s request on July 30, 2025. (DE 73). The Tribe has since filed an \nIntervenor Complaint, (DE 84), and joined Friends and CBD’s Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction. (DE 85). \nApp.114\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 7 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 144 of 226 \nthe first time that “venue is not proper in this Court.” (DE 50 at 1). At a Status Conference \nthat day, the Court set a briefing schedule on the issue and oral arguments for July 30, \n2025. (DE 54). ‘“Where facts are bitterly contested and credibility determinations must be \nmade to decide whether injunctive relief should issue,’ district courts must hold an \nevidentiary hearing on the propriety of injunctive relief.” Farmworker Ass’n of Fla. v. \nMoody, 734 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1320–21 (S.D. Fla. 2024) (quoting McDonald’s Corp. v. \nRobertson, 147 F.3d 1301, 1312 (11th Cir. 1998). Therefore, the Court also set an \nevidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction for August 6, 2025.  \n(DE 54). \nA. Preliminary Injunction Hearing  \nOver four days of evidentiary presentation and oral argument between August 6 \nand August 13, 2025, the Court heard testimony from ten witnesses and viewed over a \nhundred exhibits. Plaintiffs first called Friends Executive Director Eve Samples, who \nspoke  both  of  her  personal,  and  the  50,000-member  organization’s  commitment  to \npreserving the Everglades and the procedural harms they have faced due to Defendants’ \nfailure to consult with Friends before building the detention camp. State Representative \nAnna Eskamani recounted a July 12, 2025 tour of the facility led by Director Guthrie. She \ntestified that on the tour, Director Guthrie informed her that the facility was the product of \na DHS request, that there would be a federal reimbursement to the state for the facility’s \ncosts, that detainees are dropped off at the site by federal agents, and that ICE inspects \nthe facility. CBD member Amber Crooks described hiking, camping, stargazing, and \nanimal-watching in the preserved areas around the TNT site, shared her fears that the \nlight pollution, increased traffic, and wastewater associated with the project will frustrate \nApp.115\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 8 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 145 of 226 \nher future enjoyment of the area, and stated her readiness to engage with any future \nNEPA process. Next, 27-year veteran of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation \nCommission, ecologist, and panther expert Randy Kautz explained how increased light, \nsound, vehicular traffic, and other human activity from the project risks loss of habitat and \nincreased mortality for the estimated 120 to 230 remaining Florida panthers. The final \nwitness on August 6 was Friends member Jessica Namath, an avid outdoorswoman and \nanimal watcher, who described regularly hiking and driving in the areas surrounding the \nTNT site before the camp’s construction. Since then, Ms. Namath testified to spending \nnearly every day at the access gate to the TNT site to bear witness to its transformation. \nShe described the site’s industrial lighting and her observation of heavy construction \nmaterials and machinery coming and going to and from the site, and of federal law \nenforcement vehicles entering the site daily.  \nOn August 7, Plaintiffs called soil physicist, hydrologist, and wetland ecologist Dr. \nChristopher McVoy. After touring the project with site Incident Commander Dr. Frank E. \nLumm, and reviewing photos and soil reports, Dr. McVoy opined that over 800,000 square \nfeet of new paving had been introduced at the site, which risked disrupting the nutrient \nbalance of the surrounding, connected wetlands by increasing runoff. Next, former Miami-\nDade County Department of Environmental Regulatory Management geologist Dillon \nReio presented an analysis concluding that the Defendants’ 800,000 square feet of new \npaving could lead to large increases in runoff contaminated with polycyclic aromatic \nhydrocarbons (“PAH”) and other carcinogens into the surrounding wetlands. He also \ntestified that the project did not appear to have any meaningful stormwater management \nsystem, based on his review of permitting databases and the camp’s engineering plans.  \nApp.116\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 9 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 146 of 226 \nOn August 12, the Tribe called two members of its environmental team, Director \nof  Water  Resources  Amy  Castaneda  and  Fish  and  Wildlife  Department  Director  \nDr. Marcel Bozas.8 Castaneda testified that eighty percent of the Tribe’s residences, two \nschools, and the Tribal governmental building, are all located in the Miccosukee Reserved \nArea a few miles southeast of the TNT site in Miami-Dade County. She explained that \nany uncontained wastewater or run-off leaving the TNT site will likely flow into the BCNP, \nEverglades National Park, and eventually into the Miccosukee Reserved Area. She \nfurther testified that the multi-billion-dollar water management projects associated with \nthe  recently  enacted  WERP—which  was  the  culmination  of  an  almost  decade-long \nplanning—were based on the TNT site’s old usage as a training airport, and that WERP’s \npreservation  efforts  in  the  area  could  be  hindered  by  high-nutrient  runoff  from  the \ndetention camp. Dr. Bozas testified about the site’s current and potential harmful impacts \non the environment and the Tribe’s use of the lands. He testified about the Tribe’s \ntraditions of hunting, fishing, and collection of medicinal or other culturally important plants \naround the site. He pointed out off-road trails with trailheads on the camp’s fence line, \nwhich had served as the Tribe’s access points to BCNP and which are now inaccessible. \nHe also discussed how the increased human activity, traffic, noise, and light from the \nproject is likely to disrupt wildlife in the area, including the endangered panther, bonneted \nbat, and wood stork.  \nThe only witness called by Defendants was Florida Department of Highway Safety \n8 Castaneda earned a bachelor’s degree of science in natural resource conservation and \nhas worked in the Tribe’s Water Resources Division for nineteen years. (DE 129 at 12). \nDr. Bozas holds a Ph.D. in earth system science and natural resources and conducted a \nstudy for his dissertation of wildlife movement in the Miccosukee Water Conservation \nArea and Everglades National Park. (Id. at 96–97). \nApp.117\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 10 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 147 of 226 \nand Motor Vehicles (“FDHSMV”) Executive Director David Kerner. Director Kerner, who \nalso oversees the Florida Highway Patrol (“FHP”), discussed FHP’s coordination with ICE \nunder their 287(g) agreement. He explained how FHP troopers contact ICE to make a \ndetention determination after stopping an individual on state law violations and then \nsuspecting that individual of lacking lawful status. He said that it is federal agencies and \nagents, not FHP troopers, who transport detainees to the TNT site, and federal agencies \nwho carry out deportations using federal aircraft. Director Kerner also discussed the \nimportance of immigration enforcement in Florida generally, referencing an uptick in \nhuman and narcotics trafficking across the border, and the importance of increasing \ndetention  capacity  to  those  enforcement  priorities.  Director  Kerner  testified  that  his \nknowledge of who was being detained at the TNT site was limited, though he knew all \ndetainees were there solely on immigration violations, none on state criminal charges. \nFinally, Director Kerner said he had been on a tour of the facility before it became \noperational and that he was not aware of any other sites that had been considered for the \nfacility. Defendants also introduced evidence that the TNT site had been in active use as \na training airport for decades before the project, and questioned witnesses about how risk \nof harms from its use as a detention camp compare to those of its prior use facilitating \ntraining flights. And throughout the Hearing, Defendants cross-examined witnesses about \ntheir failure to collect data proving that the detention camp was having the harmful effects \nthey described in their testimony. \nAlthough the Court heard testimony into the early evening of August 6, the Parties \nagreed the Preliminary Injunction Hearing would not conclude that day. At that time, \ncounsel for the State and Federal Defendants informed the Court that they had absolute \nApp.118\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 11 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 148 of 226 \nscheduling  conflicts  which  would  preclude  resumption  of  the  proceedings  until  the \nfollowing Tuesday. After some discussion with the Court, the Parties agreed that the \nHearing could proceed the next day for just a half day, to be resumed the following \nTuesday.  \nAt the close of the half day of testimony on August 7, Plaintiffs renewed their \nrequest for a limited TRO, citing evidence suggesting that Defendants planned to add \npaving and other infrastructure over the weekend, while the Hearing was in recess. \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs requested that the Court prevent any additional industrial-style \nlighting, paving, filling, excavating, site preparation, or fencing from being introduced to \nthe  site.  The  Court  inquired  as  to  whether  Defendants  would  agree  that  no  such \nconstruction would take place over the five-day hiatus. Defendants were unwilling to make \nthis representation. Consequently, after hearing additional argument, the Court granted \nPlaintiffs’ narrow request for a TRO, halting further expansion of the site for fourteen days. \n(DE 104). The Court then concluded the evidentiary presentation on August 12, 2025, \nand heard closing remarks the following day. \nB. 287(g) Agreements \n“For nearly 150 years, the Supreme Court has held that the power to control \nimmigration—the entry, admission, and removal of noncitizens—is exclusively a federal \npower.” United States v. Texas, 97 F.4th 268, 278–79 (5th Cir. 2024). However, “[f]ederal \nlaw specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may perform the functions of \nan immigration officer[,]” such as through a formal agreement under § 1357(g)(1). Arizona \nv.  United  States,  567  U.S.  387,  408–09  (2012).  As  mentioned  above,  the  Federal \nDefendants concede that the camp operates pursuant to such “287(g)” agreements \nApp.119\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 12 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 149 of 226 \nbetween DHS (through ICE) and relevant Florida law enforcement agencies, along with \nthe aid of on-site federal agents. (DE 105 at 34). In a separate case raising constitutional \nchallenges  to  particular  practices  at  the  camp,  the  State  and  Federal  Defendants \nproduced several of the operative 287(g) agreements, including those between ICE and \nnine Florida agencies: Florida Department of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco Bureau \nof Law Enforcement (“FDABT”); Florida Department of Corrections (“FDOC”); Florida \nDepartment of Law Enforcement (“FDLE”); Florida Department of Financial Services \nCriminal  Investigations  Division  (“DFS”);  FDHSMV,  Division  of  FHP;  Florida  Fish  & \nWildlife Conservation Commission (“FWC”) (DE 53-1 at 78), Florida Department of Lottery \nDivision of Security (“FDL”), the Florida National Guard (“FNG”), and Florida Department \nof Environmental Protection Division of Law Enforcement (“FDEP”). C.M. v. Noem,  \n25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 53-1 at 2, 17, 32, 47, 62, 78, 93, 108, 123 (collectively, the \n“287(g)  Agreements”).9  Each  of  those  agreements  contains  essentially  identical \nsections, titled “Ice Supervision” and “Liability and Responsibility”. Id. at 6–9, 19–20, 29, \n36–39, 51–54, 67–70, 82–85, 97–100, 112–15, 127–30. Those sections include the \nfollowing language:  \nXI. ICE SUPERVISION  \n \nImmigration enforcement activities conducted by participating LEA personnel will \nbe supervised and directed by ICE. Participating LEA personnel are not authorized \n9 “A district court may take judicial notice of public records within its files relating to the \nparticular case before it or other related cases.” Cash Inn of Dade, Inc. v. Metro. Dade \nCnty., 938 F.2d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir. 1991); see also Lockett v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., \n2021 WL 4815898, at *1, *12 n.9 (N.D. Ga. June 30, 2021) (“The Court may take judicial \nnotice  of  public  records,  such  as  court  filings  on public  dockets.”)  (citing  Universal \nExpress, Inc. v. S.E.C., 177 F. App’x 52, 53 (11th Cir. 2006))); Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Beall, \nNo. 23-cv-00060, 2024 WL 3993851, at *5 (M.D. Ga. Aug. 29, 2024) (explaining contract \nwas not hearsay because its language was legally operative, not used to prove the truth \nof another matter).  \nApp.120\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 13 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 150 of 226 \nto  perform  immigration  officer  functions  except  when  working  under  the \nsupervision or direction of ICE.  \n \nFor the purposes of this MOA, ICE officers will provide supervision of participating \nLEA personnel only as to immigration enforcement functions. The LEA retains \nsupervision of all other aspects of the employment of and performance of duties \nby participating LEA personnel.  \n \nIn the absence of a written agreement to the contrary, the policies and procedures \nto be utilized by the participating LEA personnel in exercising these authorities \nshall be DHS and ICE policies and procedures, including the ICE Use of Force \nPolicy.  \n \nXIV. LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY  \n \nParticipating LEA personnel will be treated as Federal employees for purposes of \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(l), 2671-2680, and worker's \ncompensation claims, 5 U.S.C. § 8101 et seq., when performing a function on \nbehalf of ICE as authorized by this MOA. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(7); 28 U.S.C. § \n2671. In addition, it is the understanding of the parties to this MOA that \nparticipating  LEA  personnel  performing  a  function  on  behalf  of  ICE \nauthorized by this MOA will be considered acting under color of federal \nauthority for purposes of determining liability and immunity from suit under \nfederal or state law. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(8). \n  \nThese provisions are replete with express references to the statutory framework \nthat governs 287(g) agreements. Section 1357(g) allows states or localities to enter into \nagreements with the Attorney General to deputize state or local officers to perform \nfunctions of federal immigration officers when they are “determined by the Attorney \nGeneral to be qualified to perform” those functions after receiving training and certification \n“regarding the enforcement of relevant Federal immigration laws.” § 1357(g)(1)–(2). \nWhen acting under a 287(g) agreement, the deputized officer “shall be subject to the \ndirection and supervision of the Attorney General.” § 1357(g)(3). Further, any 287(g) \nagreement  must  specify  the  deputized  officer’s  powers  and  duties,  the  duration  of \ndelegated authority, and the federal agency official who is “required to supervise and \ndirect the individual[.]” § 1357(g)(5). Finally, the deputized officer is treated as a federal \nApp.121\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 14 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 151 of 226 \nemployee for purposes of compensation for injury and tort liability, and the officer “shall \nbe considered to be acting under color of Federal authority for purposes of determining \nthe liability, and immunity from suit[.]” § 1357(g)(7)–(8).   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \n“Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3), a party may assert the defense \nof improper venue.” Hemispherx Biopharma, Inc. v. MidSouth Capital, Inc., 669 F. Supp. \n2d 1353, 1356 (S.D. Fla. 2009). When a defendant does, “the plaintiff bears the burden \nof showing that the venue selected is proper.” Id. (citing Delong Equip. Co. v. Wash. Mills \nAbrasive Co., 840 F.2d 843, 845 (11th Cir. 1988)); Wai v. Rainbow Holdings, 315 F. Supp. \n2d 1261, 1268 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (“On a motion to dismiss based on improper venue, the \nplaintiff has the burden of showing that venue in the forum is proper.”). A court “must \naccept all allegations of the complaint as true, unless contradicted by the defendants’ \nevidence, and the court “may examine facts outside of the complaint” when factual \ndisputes arise. Id. (citations omitted). In reviewing the allegations and evidence, “the court \nmust draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all factual conflicts in favor of the \nplaintiff.” Hemispherx, 669 F. Supp. 2d at 1356; see also Home Ins. Co. v. Thomas Indus., \nInc., 896 F.2d 1352, 1355 (11th Cir. 1990) (when reviewing a Rule 12(b)(3) motion and \nthe parties’ “affidavits conflict, the court is inclined to give greater weight to the plaintiff’s \nversion of the jurisdictional facts and to construe such facts in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff.”). Finally, “venue must be proper as to each defendant and each claim.”  \nDoe 1 v. Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary, No. 23-cv-5294, 2024 WL \n4276174, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.

Gasch, 511 F.2d 804, 807 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1975)).        \nEven if venue is proper, a court may transfer a case to another district in which \nvenue lies “in the interest of justice.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404. The court should consider \n“convenience of parties and witnesses, the ‘locus of operative facts,’ and other concerns \nrelated to ‘trial efficiency[.]’” Bryant v. Sheriff, Saint Lucie Cnty., Fla., 2024 WL 4458382, \nat *8 (11th Cir. Oct. 10, 2024) (quoting Manuel v. Convergys Corp., 430 F.3d 1132, 1135 \nn.1  (11th  Cir.  2005)).  Additionally,  the  court  should  weigh  “various  public-interest \nconsiderations,” including “the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion; \nthe local interest in having localized controversies decided at home; [and] the interest in \nhaving the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the law.” Atl. Marine \nConstr. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the W. Dist. of Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 62 n.6 (2013) (internal \nquotations omitted). \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes courts to grant a \npreliminary injunction before final judgment in limited circumstances. The purpose of this \ninjunctive relief is to “preserve the status quo until the district court renders a meaningful \ndecision on the merits.” Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th \nCir. 2005) (citation omitted). To merit a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show:  \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the preliminary \ninjunction is necessary to prevent irreparable injury; (3) that the threatened \ninjury outweighs the harm the preliminary injunction would cause the other \nlitigant; and (4) that the preliminary injunction would not be averse to the \npublic interest. \n \nGissendaner v. Comm’r, Ga. Dep’t of Corr., 779 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting \nWellons  v.  Comm’r,  Ga.

Amazon.com, Inc., 840 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2016) \n(internal quotations omitted).  \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nDefendants levy several objections to the propriety of the Court’s adjudication of \nthis matter. First, Defendants argue that 8 U.S.C. 1252(a) and (f) strip the Court of subject-\nmatter  jurisdiction  over  any  aspect  of  Plaintiffs’  NEPA  claim  that  relates  to  federal \nimmigration detention activities. (DE 16 at 12; DE 21 at 5–6). Next, Defendants contest \nwhether the S.D. Fla. is the proper district for Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Guthrie \nand the  Federal  Defendants.  The  Court  will  address  these  threshold  issues  before \ndiscussing the merits of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.10  \n10  Although  Defendants  do  not  contest  Plaintiffs’  standing,  a  “district  court  [is]  not \nempowered to reach any merits question” without first establishing its jurisdiction. See \nWiand v. ATC Brokers Ltd., 96 F.4th 1303, 1311 (11th Cir. 2024). So, the Court will briefly \naddress Plaintiffs’ standing to seek injunctive relief. Plaintiffs may establish standing \nthrough either their own injury in fact or through associational standing by virtue of injuries \nposed to or suffered by their members. City of S. Mia. v. Governor, 65 F.4th 631, 637 \n(11th Cir. 2023). “To establish associational standing, an organization must prove that its \nmembers ‘would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right.’” Jacobson v. Fla. \nSec’y of State, 974 F.3d 1236, 1249 (11th Cir. 2020) (citations omitted). To this end, \nPlaintiffs must “make specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member \nhad suffered or would suffer harm.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498 \n(2009). Here, Plaintiffs allege (and have supported through evidence) that their members’ \naesthetic,  conservational,  and  recreational  interests  are  adversely  impacted  by  the \ndetention camp’s operations. From light pollution affecting members’ ability to observe \nthe night skies, to noise pollution impacting members’ ability to observe and interact with \nwildlife, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the injuries to their members \nand, therefore, have established associational standing. See Ouachita Watch League v. \nJacobs, 463 F.3d 1163, 1170–73 (11th Cir. 2006) (plaintiff environmental groups “easily” \nhad associational standing when alleging that an agency “shirked its duties under NEPA \n. . ., with the result that already vulnerable species and their habitats are now more \nvulnerable,” and the group’s members use the area to recreate and engage with the \nenvironment).  \n \nApp.124\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 17 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 154 of 226 \nA. Section 1252 does not strip the Court of subject-matter jurisdiction over this \nNEPA claim.  \n \n1.  Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  \nSection 1252(a)(2)(b)(ii) provides that “[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review . \n. . any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity the authority for which is specified under this subsection to be in the discretion \nof the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security[.]” The statute “precludes \n[the Court’s] review of discretionary decisions of the [Secretary] in only th[os]e specific \ncircumstances.” Zafar v. United States Attorney General, 461 F.3d 1357, 1360 (11th Cir. \n2006) (emphasis in original); see also Bakran v. Sec’y United States Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 894 F.3d 557, 562 (3d Cir. 2018) (“The INA’s jurisdiction-stripping language . . . \napplies not to all decisions the [Secretary] is entitled to make, but to a narrower category \nof decisions where Congress has taken the additional step to specify that the sole \nauthority for the action is in the [Secretary]’s decision.”) (citations and quotations omitted). \n“The statute requires us to look at the particular decision being made and to ascertain \nwhether  that  decision  is  one  that  Congress  has  designated  to  be  discretionary.”  \nMejia Rodriguez v.

However, Plaintiffs challenge neither the fact \nnor the manner of detention or removal. Rather, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief compelling \nDefendants to comply with NEPA, which ensures “federal agencies . . . adequately assess \nthe environmental impacts of actions they undertake.” City of Oxford, Ga. v. F.A.A., 428 \nF.3d 1346, 1352 (11th Cir. 2005). This relief does not implicate, much less interfere with, \nany decision “specified . . . to be in the discretion” of the Secretary or the Attorney \nGeneral. Because NEPA compliance is not a decision specified to be in the discretion of \nthe Attorney General or Secretary, § 1252(a)(2)(b)(ii) simply does not apply. Defendants \nconflate two very distinct types of relief. An injunction requiring NEPA compliance would, \nat most, prevent the use of the facility until a lawful NEPA review is done. This is not the \nsame thing as the Court dictating where or how the government must house immigration \ndetainees, which Congress has specified to be within the Secretary’s discretion. Plaintiffs \nseek only the former type of relief.11 \nDefendants’  cited  cases—nearly  all  of  which  feature  individual  plaintiffs \nchallenging  their  own  detentions  or  removals—confirm  this  distinction.  Defendants \nselectively quote language from these cases to suggest that § 1252(a)(2)(b)(ii) is broader \nthan it is. Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Attorney General and Secretary possess \nauthority over detention and removal as those cases recognize. But those decisions arose \nin entirely different factual and legal contexts. None address NEPA, none involve the \n11 In C.M. v. Noem, the court drew a similar conclusion when analyzing whether another \njurisdiction-stripping provision of the INA, § 1252(g), precluded review of claims by \ndetainees at the TNT site alleging the manner of their detentions unduly restricted their \naccess to counsel. 25-cv-23182 (S.D.

Wiersum v. U.S. \nBank, N.A., 785 F.3d 483, 488 (11th Cir. 2015) (“As the Supreme Court has instructed \ntime again, courts presume Congress says in a statute what it means and means in a \nstatute what it says there.”) (citations and quotations omitted); Harris v.

Section 1252(f)(1)  \nDefendants also rely on § 1252(f)(1), which provides that “no court (other than the \nSupreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of \nthe provisions of part IV of this subchapter.” In other words, “[i]t prohibits federal courts \nfrom granting classwide injunctive relief” against certain provisions of the INA, specifically \n§§ 1221–1231. Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482 \n(1999); see also Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. 543, 550 (2022) (“§ 1252(f)(1) \ngenerally prohibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order federal officials to take \nor to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified \nstatutory  provisions.”).  “Those  provisions  charge  the  Federal  Government  with  the \nimplementation  and  enforcement  of  the  immigration  laws  governing  the  inspection, \napprehension, examination, and removal of aliens.” Id. at 549–50. \nHere, Plaintiffs’ requested relief does not fall within that bar. They do not seek to \nhalt, suspend, or alter the “operation” of any INA provision, nor do they challenge the \nDefendants’ authority to implement or enforce immigration laws. An order compelling \nNEPA compliance does not “enjoin or restrain” immigration operations; it simply requires \nApp.128\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 21 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 158 of 226 \nDefendants  to  follow  the  environmental  procedures  that  Congress  imposed.  \nSee generally Fla.

Fla. 2005) (“NEPA establishes important action-forcing procedures to \nensure that the broad national commitment to protecting and promoting environmental \nquality is infused into the actions of the federal government.”) (citations and quotations \nomitted). Thus, to the extent Defendants argue otherwise based on detention decisions \nunder  §  1226,  that  reliance  is  misplaced.  Plaintiffs  do  not  challenge  any  detention \ndecision, and § 1226 contains no language suggesting that NEPA compliance is shielded \nfrom judicial review. “Congress legislated which sections are covered by § 1252(f)(1). The \nExecutive Branch does not get to propose additions.” Texas v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 123 F.4th 186, 210 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nAnd if NEPA compliance has a “collateral effect” on immigration operations, that is \ninsufficient to trigger § 1252(f)(1). Id. at 209 (“[A] court may enjoin the unlawful operation \nof  a  provision that  is  not  specified  in §  1252(f)(1) even  if  that  injunction  has  some \ncollateral effect on the operation of a covered provision.”) (emphasis in original; citation \nomitted); see also United Farm Workers v.

Thus, even if an injunction could have a collateral \neffect on the provisions identified by Defendants, the Court has the jurisdiction and the \nauthority to issue an injunction.”). Therefore, neither § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) nor § 1252(f)(1) \ndeprive the Court of jurisdiction to require Defendants’ compliance with NEPA.  \n \nApp.129\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 22 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 159 of 226 \nB. The Southern District of Florida is the appropriate venue for this suit. \nNext, the State and Federal Defendants each argue that venue in the S.D. Fla. is \nimproper.12 (DE 50 at 1; DE 60 at 1). Plaintiffs assert that the State waived its venue \nchallenge. Plaintiffs go on to argue that regardless, venue in the S.D. Fla. is proper as to \nthe Federal Defendants under § 1391(e)(1)(B) and § 1391(e)(1)(C), (DE 66 at 3), and is \nproper as to the State under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). (DE 61 at 8). The Court will address \neach issue in turn.  \n1.  Waiver \nPlaintiffs initially argue that the State waived any venue challenge by litigating this \ncase on the merits for almost a month—including filing three merits briefs in opposition to \nPlaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief—before raising venue. (DE 16; DE 28; DE 35).  \n“A party waives [improper venue] by . . . failing to . . . include it in a responsible pleading \nor in an amendment allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(h)(1)(B)(ii). It may also be waived by other “conduct amounting to waiver as a matter \nof law.” Manley v. Engram, 755 F.2d 1463, 1468 (11th Cir. 1985). “Because a motion to \ndismiss for lack of venue . . . can be raised so easily, [courts] strictly apply the waiver \nrule[.]” Manchester Knitted Fashions, Inc. v. Amalgamated Cotton Garment and Allied \nIndus.

Holder, 681 F. Supp. 2d 1083, \n1091 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (venue was waived when defendants filed two opposition motions \nto plaintiff’s preliminary injunction request, including a declaration on the case’s merits).  \nHere, the State filed notices of appearance on the same day the Complaint was \nfiled. (DE 10; DE 11). Then, over the course of almost a month, the State filed three merits \nbriefs, including a declaration from FDEM Executive Director Guthrie. (DE 16; DE 28;  \nDE 35). The State also filed a motion for extension of time to respond to the Complaint in \norder to align its deadline with the Federal Defendants’, all without mentioning venue.  \n(DE 39). In short, the State failed to raise venue in any of its first three defensive moves, \ndespite the opportunity. This is sufficient for a finding of waiver.  \nThe State argues that the above cited cases are distinguishable because in those \ncases preliminary injunction hearings were held without mention of waiver. (DE 65 at 4–\n5). But none of those courts discuss that fact as relevant to their decisions. The State \nthen offers a series of inapposite cases where courts rejected waiver in completely \ndifferent scenarios to the one presented here. See Lithia Ramsey-T, LLC v. City Line Auto \nSales, LLC, No. 22-03592, 2023 WL 1883355, at *5 (D.N.J.

Though Defendants’ \nwaiver of venue is sufficient to foreclose venue as an issue, the Court addresses the \nmerits of all Defendants’ venue challenges, as both Parties requested. \n2.  Section 1391(e)(1)(C) \nWhen “a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency \nthereof” a civil action may “be brought in any judicial district in which . . . the plaintiff \nresides if no real property is involved in the action.” § 1391(e)(1)(C). For venue purposes, \na plaintiff entity resides “only in the judicial district in which it maintains its principal place \nof business[.]” § 1391(c)(2). Friends has its principal place of business in Stuart, FL, within \nthe S.D. Fla. (DE 61-1). The Federal Defendants do not dispute that this satisfies the first \nrequirement of § 1391(e)(1)(C). They argue that “Plaintiffs’ suit centers on the temporary \ndetention center, which is a collection of buildings and pavement on real property[,]” and \nApp.132\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 25 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 162 of 226 \n“[t]hus, real property is a center component of this action[.]” (DE 60 at 4). But the Federal \nDefendants’ far-reaching interpretation runs counter to decades of authority and the \npurpose of § 1391(e), which is “to broaden the venue of civil actions” against federal \ndefendants. Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 490 n.4 (1971). As Judge Constance \nBaker Motley sagely wrote: \nGravity being what it is, the vast bulk of human activities take place on the face of \nthe earth. Consequently, almost any dispute over public or private decisions will in \nsome way “involve real property,” taken literally. The touchstone for applying § \n1391(e)(4) [(the prior, identical version of § 1391(e)(1)(C))] cannot sensibly be \nwhether real property is marginally affected by the case at issue. Rather, the action \nmust center directly on the real property, as with actions concerning the right, title \nor interest in real property. \n \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Tenn. Val.

Earth Island Inst. v. Quinn, 56 F.Supp.3d 1110, 1112, \n1116 (N.D. Cal. 2014). The court began its analysis by pointing out that, “by using the \nlegal term ‘real property[]’ . . . Congress seems to have indicated that it intended mainly \nto cover disputes over legal interests in real property.” Id. at 1115–16. Indeed, the court \nfound, “[m]ost authority appears to have followed [Judge Motley’s] logic, generally finding \nthat  actions  ‘involve  real  property’  when  they  involve  disputes  over  real  property \ninterests—and perhaps not even then if the real property dispute is peripheral to the \ncentral cause of action.” Id. at 1116 (first citing Wright & Miller, 14D Fed.

Even though the case \nrelated to the use of “a specific area of land,” the court concluded this was insufficient to \nbring the suit within the category of real property disputes triggering the exception, as it \nwas more centrally a suit about “personal property interests in timber and regulatory and \nenvironmental policy issues.” Id. at 1116. \nNext,  in  Western  Watersheds  Project  v.  Schneider,  the  court  reaffirmed  its \ninterpretation of “§ 1391(e)(1)(C) to mean that ‘real property’ is not ‘involved’ in a lawsuit \nchallenging an agency’s compliance with NEPA[.]” W.

Though plaintiff’s suit implicated third-party property rights as an ancillary matter, \nplaintiffs were not disputing any party’s “right, title or interest in real property.” Id. at *3. \nInstead, the court held, like the court in Earth Island v. Quinn, that plaintiffs were merely \n“challeng[ing] an agency’s compliance with statutory mandates.” Id.  \nHere,  Plaintiffs’  suit  likewise  centers  on  non-compliance  with  “statutory \nmandates”—namely the Federal Defendants’ approval, construction, funding, and use of \nthe detention camp without conducting environmental analyses required by NEPA—not \nwho possesses any given property right to the TNT site. Therefore, even though the suit \ninvolves  real  property  in  a  colloquial  sense,  it  does  not  fit  within  the  meaning  of  \n§ 1391(e)(1)(C).  \nResisting this conclusion, Defendants point to a single case in which a court held \na suit under NEPA involved real property within § 1391(e)(1)(C). (DE 65 at 6 (citing Ctr. \nfor Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., No. 08-05646, 2009 WL 1025606, \n(N.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2009)); DE 89 at 10, 51 (same)).

The Center for Biological Diversity \ncourt may have been swayed by the sheer “range of real property issues” at play in the \nchallenged plan before it, “including access to public and private lands, rights of way and \neasements across these lands, land withdrawals, and land exchanges and acquisitions.” \nApp.135\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 28 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 165 of 226 \nId. at *1.

This \nCourt does as well.13  \nTherefore, the Court finds that this suit does not involve real property within the \nmeaning of § 1391(e)(1)(C), and the S.D. Fla. is a proper venue for this suit with regard \nto the Federal Defendants under that subsection. The Court will now address whether \nthis district is a proper venue for the State and Federal Defendants as a locus of the \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to their claims.14  \n13 Finally, Defendants argue that even accepting the stricter interpretation of the phrase, \nthis  action  does  involve  real  property,  because  Count  IV  challenges  Miami-Dade’s \nacquiescence to the State’s use of the TNT site for the project. (DE 89 at 11, 49–52; DE \n65 at 6 (“[E]ven under Plaintiffs’ test, real property interests are involved: Plaintiffs allege \nDefendants wrongfully commandeered Miami-Dade’s property[.]”)). But again, Plaintiffs \nare not seeking to vindicate any property right of Miami-Dade’s or their own—they object \nto the site’s use as a detention camp in violation of certain procedural mandates. See (DE \n1 ¶ 93 (claiming “[Miami-Dade’s] agreement or acquiescence in allowing the TNT [s]ite \nfor use as a mas[s] detention center is in violation of the County code and permitting \nregimes”)).  \n14 Defendants filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (DE 128) citing an order in C.M. v. \nNoem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 86. The undersigned is aware that an esteemed \ncolleague recently issued this order in a separate litigation involving detainees housed at \nthe TNT facility. In that case, Plaintiffs raised First and Fifth Amendment constitutional \nchallenges to their conditions of confinement at the facility. As Defendants point out, the \norder recognizes the “distinct procedural posture” of this case in its discussion of venue, \nC.M., 25-cv-23182, ECF 86 at 33 n.14, although it should be noted that the Federal \nDefendants claim that venue was improper pursuant to § 1391(e) was resoundingly \nrejected in the C.M. order. Id. at 35–38. In any event, because, as acknowledged in that \nApp.136\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 29 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 166 of 226 \n3.  Sections 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1)(B) \n“A civil action may [also] be brought in [any] judicial district in which a substantial \npart of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of \nproperty  that  is  the  subject  of  the  action  is  situated[.]”  §  1391(b)(2);  see  also  \n§ 1391(e)(1)(B) (providing transactional venue for federal defendants on the same basis). \nVenue is not confined to one district but may be proper “in two or more districts.” Jenkins \nBrick Co. v. Bremer, 321 F.3d 1366, 1371 (11th Cir. 2003). “Only the events that directly \ngive rise to a claim are relevant[,]” and “of the places where the events have taken place, \nonly those locations hosting a ‘substantial part’ of the events are to be considered.” Id.  \nHowever, the Court “is not required to weigh the events that occurred in” a plaintiff’s \nchosen district “against those that took place in” other districts and “choose which venue \nis more proper; rather, even though ‘a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to’ the claim” may have occurred in another district, “so long as the same can be said \nas to” a plaintiff’s chosen district, “venue is proper” there.

Ala. 2005) (“[A] plaintiff does \nnot have to select the venue with the most substantial nexus to the dispute, as long as \nshe chooses a venue where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim \noccurred.”).15 Further, ‘“[s]ubstantiality’ for venue purposes is more a qualitative than a \norder, the  legal and procedural  postures  of  the two  cases  are entirely distinct,  the \ndetermination as to venue in C.M. does not control or subvert the analysis here.   \n15 Therefore, it is irrelevant to the §1391(b)(2) analysis that the Middle District of Florida, \nwhere the majority of the detention camp is located, would also have been a proper venue \nfor Plaintiffs’ suit.  \nApp.137\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 30 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 167 of 226 \nquantitative inquiry, determined by assessing the overall nature of the plaintiff’s claims \nand the nature of the specific events or omissions in the forum, and not by simply adding \nup the number of contacts.” Russo v. Raimondo, No. 24-0186, 2024 WL 4571431, *5 \n(S.D. Ala. Oct. 24, 2024) (quoting Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 428 F.3d 408, \n432–33 (2d Cir. 2005)).  \nPlaintiffs argue that there are substantial events and omissions which occurred in \nthis district, making venue here a proper choice. Specifically, they point to: (1) TNT’s \npartial location in16 and ownership by Miami-Dade, (DE 61 at 9–10 (citing DE 12-3; DE \n12-4; DE 12-5)); (2) the State and Federal Defendants’ failure to conduct environmental \nassessments  and  provide  opportunity  for  notice  and  comment  regarding  the \nenvironmental impacts of the project, which would have taken place, in large part, in \nMiami-Dade, (id. at 10–11); and (3) the current and feared impacts of the project on \nMiami-Dade, its residents, threatened and endangered species within the county, and \nTribal sites and activities within Miami-Dade. (Id. at 13–15).  \n   Defendants argue that a substantial part of the events or omissions here could not \nhave taken place in the S.D. Fla. because “all the detention facilities, all the buildings, \nand all the paving at issue” are located in Collier County, in the Middle District of Florida \n(“M.D. Fla.”), and “all relevant decision[-]making was made or is being made by officials \nin Washington, DC; in Tallahassee, Florida; or onsite at the camp [.]” (DE 50 at 3–4); see \n16 Through dueling GIS maps and expert affidavits, the Parties aggressively dispute what \npercentage of the property is within Miami-Dade, 2% or 28%. (DE 79; DE 80; DE 86). It \ndoes appear that around 2% of the jetport is in Miami-Dade, while 28% of the total \ndeveloped and as yet undeveloped land is within Miami-Dade. The real disagreement is \nover which areas within the property are relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims and to what degree. \nBut, as will be explained, the answer to that question impacts venue little, so the Court \nwill not wade into this contestation. \nApp.138\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 31 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 168 of 226 \nalso (DE 60 at 1). Defendants reject the notion that Miami-Dade’s ownership of the \nproperty has any relevance to the analysis, because, since “FDEM took control of the \n[s]ite . . . [Miami-Dade’s] activities . . . ‘do not have a close nexus with the cause of action.’” \n(DE 50 at 4–5 (quoting Jenkins Brick, 321 F.3d at 1373)). Finally, Defendants insist that \nonly Defendants’ actions, not Plaintiff’s injuries, should be taken into account. (DE 65 at \n9–11).  \nMuch of the dispute stems from the Parties’ disagreement over how Jenkins \nBrick—the Eleventh Circuit’s most detailed discussion of transactional venue—should be \nunderstood. The decision in Jenkins Brick arose from a dispute involving a breach of a \nnon-compete agreement between an Alabama-based company and a Georgia-based \nemployee. 321 F.3d at 1368. The contract had been executed in Georgia, was intended \nto  be  performed  in  Savannah,  Georgia  to  protect  the  Alabama-based  company’s \nemerging Georgia activities, and was breached when the Georgie employee was hired \nby a competitor in Savannah. Id. at 1372. Arguing that venue was nonetheless proper in \nAlabama, the plaintiff-employee noted that sales and training meetings had been held in \nAlabama, his salary and benefits came from Alabama, and the executed non-compete \nagreement had been sent by the plaintiff back to Alabama. Id. at 1372–73. The Eleventh \nCircuit discounted these connections to Alabama, finding “they did not have a close nexus \nwith the cause of action for breach of contract.” Id. at 1373. Because “all of the events \n‘giving rise to’” the claims occurred in Georgia, the court held Alabama was an improper \nforum. Id. \nIn its analysis, the Eleventh Circuit cited an Eighth Circuit case, Woodke v. Dahm, \n70 F.3d 983 (8th Cir. 1995), in which a plaintiff who sold and designed semi-trailers \nApp.139\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 32 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 169 of 226 \nclaimed the defendant was passing off trailers under an identical trademark. Id. at 1371. \nThe plaintiff filed the case “in the state of his residency, Iowa, even though he had no \nevidence of wrongdoing in that state.” Id. (citing Woodke 70 F.3d at 985). To support \nvenue in Iowa, the plaintiff argued Iowa is “the location of the ultimate effect of the passing \noff.”  Woodke,  70  F.3d  at  985.  He  also  proffered  the  fact  that  the  trailers  were \nmanufactured in Iowa, before having the trademarks altered elsewhere. Id. Assessing the \nvenue claim, the Woodke court found the initial manufacturing of the trailers was too \ncausally remote from “the kinds of events that give rise to a claim” to be factored into the \nanalysis. Id. Without any other relevant connections to Iowa, the court “reject[ed the \nplaintiff’s] argument that venue lies in [Iowa] simply because that was where he was \nresiding when the passing off occurred.” Id. As the Woodke court explained, \nWhile the present venue statute was certainly intended to expand the number of \nvenues available to a plaintiff, we are reluctant to impute to Congress an intent to \nabandon altogether the protection of defendants as a relevant consideration in \nvenue matters. We think it far more likely that . . . Congress meant to require courts \nto focus on relevant activities of the defendant, not the plaintiff. \n \nId.  \nTwo guiding principles emerge from a more than cursory review of these cases \nand their reasoning. First, while the Court must “focus” the inquiry on the acts and \nomissions of the Defendant, these cases do not stand for the drastic proposition that the \nCourt must “ignore the place of injury altogether. They simply hold that the place of . . . \ninjury is not alone sufficient to create venue.” Am. Action Network, Inc. v. Cater Am., LLC, \nNo. 12-cv-1972, 2014 WL 12675253, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2014) (discussing Jenkins \nBrick and Woodke, among other cases). Indeed, courts within the Eleventh Circuit have \nregularly factored the location of injury into their analyses since Jenkins Brick was \nApp.140\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 33 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 170 of 226 \ndecided.

In Jenkins Brick, the court found relevant the location \nwhere the non-compete agreement was executed and intended to be performed. Id. As \nlong as the events are not too causally remote from the wrongful acts, these events are \n17 The Jenkins Brick court acknowledged that harm may be relevant, when discussing \nCongress’s rationale for amending the venue statute. The court noted that “[t]he old \nlanguage was problematic because it was oftentimes difficult to pinpoint the single district \nin which a ‘claim arose.’” Jenkins Brick, 321 F.3d at 1371. The court gave the example of \n“a toxic tort case in which the defendant’s factories in Colorado and Missouri pollute a \nriver, causing injury to Arkansas and Louisiana citizens who ingest the water.” Id. Under \nthe old statute allowing venue in only one district, a court would have been forced to “pick \na district in an arbitrary fashion,” since any of the locations provide a reasonable forum. \nId.  The  court’s  identification  of  Arkansas  and  Louisiana—districts  where  the  harm \noccurred in the hypothetical—as examples of possible venues, indicates the court’s \nunderstanding that harm is not wholly irrelevant to the analysis.  \nApp.141\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 34 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 171 of 226 \nrelevant as “part of the ‘historical predicate’ of the claim.” MacDermid Printing Sols., LLC \nv. Clear Stamp, Inc., 2013 WL 3176887, at *5 (N.D. Ind. June 21, 2013). For example, in \nNorth MS Medical Center, the court held venue for an Emergency Medical Treatment and \nActive  Labor  Act  (“EMTALA”)  claim  was  appropriate  in  Alabama,  even  though  the \ndecedent was injured, hospitalized, treated, and eventually prematurely discharged in \nMississippi. 403 F. Supp. 2d at 1123. The court found that the hospital’s transportation of \nthe decedent in an ambulance back to his home in Alabama, where he later died of \nuntreated injuries, bore a “close nexus to the wrong,” even though “the alleged EMTALA \nviolation may have been satisfied the moment that [the defendant] wheeled [the decedent] \nout  the  front  door  of  the  [h]ospital[.]”  Id.  In  part,  this  was  because  the  Alabama \noccurrences would be part of “the proof at trial.” Id. \n  Turning  back  to  this  case,  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  alleges  that  Defendants’ \nconstruction and operation of the TNT site as an immigration detention camp violates \nvarious federal, state, and county laws. The NEPA claim asserts that because the project \ncreates  major  environmental  impacts  and  is  subject  to  significant  federal  control, \nDefendants were required to conduct certain environmental reviews beforehand and did \nnot. These claims implicate a broad range of Defendants’ conduct, and the scope of \nrelevant acts and omissions is equally broad, and includes: Defendants’ efforts to take \ncontrol of the TNT site and failure to obtain critical information from the site’s owner; \naspects of Defendants’ decision-making process regarding the facilities’ construction and \noperations; and, critically, any of Defendants’ detainee transportation, detention, and \ndeportation activities related to the project. A substantial portion of these events took \nplace and are taking place in Miami-Dade, within the S.D. Fla.  \nApp.142\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 35 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 172 of 226 \n  First, because Miami-Dade owns the TNT site, Director Guthrie began the project’s \nexecution by sending a notice of intent to purchase the TNT site and associated lands to \nMiami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. (DE 12-3). Defendant Miami-Dade, through \nMayor Levine Cava, responded by alerting Director Guthrie to Miami-Dade’s concerns \nthat Defendants must “understand the scope and scale of the proposed use of the site \nand what will be developed, as the impacts [on] the Everglades ecosystem could be \ndevastating.” (DE 12-4 at 1). The State did not heed Miami-Dade’s warnings or ask for \nany  additional  information  from  Miami-Dade  to  educate  itself  on  scope,  scale,  and \nimpacts. This interaction was an initial act—or failure to act—in the joint, multi-step \ndecision-making  process  by  Defendants,  which  is  a  necessary  predicate  to  NEPA \ncompliance,  and  which  gave  rise  to  Plaintiffs’  NEPA  claim.  See  Russo,  2024  WL \n4571431, at *2–4 (in APA claim challenging a final rule promulgated by a federal agency, \nan antecedent meeting and vote by a regional council to send a proposed rule to the \nagency for approval “qualifies as an event that directly g[a]ve[] rise to the plaintiff’s claims” \neven though it was not the actionable event). The State then responded to Miami-Dade’s \nletter, notifying the County of the State’s intent to commandeer the property for use as a \ndetention camp. (DE 12-5).   \n  Next, Defendants’ use of the site includes actions currently taking place in the S.D. \nFla.  Most  importantly,  ICE’s  Miami  field  office  is  responsible  for  coordinating  and \nsupervising  immigration  enforcement  functions  conducted  by  deputized  state  law \nenforcement agency officials. (DE 21-1 ¶ 5, 8 (declaration from ICE Interim Assistant \nDirector of Field Operations Thomas Giles confirming that the detention camp operates \nunder Florida agencies’ 287(g) agreements with ICE); DE 118-1 ¶ 9 (declaration from ICE \nApp.143\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 36 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 173 of 226 \nMiami field office director stating that he oversees the relevant 287(g) agreements)). In a \ndifferent case raising constitutional challenges to detainee treatment on the TNT site, the \nFederal Defendants filed a declaration by another ICE Miami field office official, Juan \nLopez  Vega,  in  which  he  attested  that  his  responsibilities  “include  overseeing \n[Enforcement and Removal Operations], and detention facility operations within the Miami \n[Area of Responsibility], including those at the South Florida Soft Sided Facility South \n(SFSSFS). . . . which is also known as Alligator Alcatraz.” C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 \n(S.D. Fla.), ECF 50-1 ¶¶ 3–4.18 Given that the sole use of the site is to detain those in \nfederal immigration custody, all activities on the site are supervised and directed by the \nMiami ICE field office. See supra Section I.B. (quoting language from 287(g) agreements \nstating, “[i]mmigration enforcement activities conducted by participating LEA personnel \nwill be supervised and directed by ICE.”). Additionally, the Federal Defendants bring \ndetainees from other Miami-Dade detention facilities to the TNT site. (DE 114 at 312–14). \nIn fact, in another case involving the detention camp, Federal Defendants recently filed a \nnotice that “the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) has designated Krome \nNorth Service Processing Center (Krome) as the immigration court with administrative \nresponsibility over the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.” C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 \n(S.D. Fla.), ECF 83. These core actions are alone sufficient to make venue proper in the \nS.D. Fla. See Managed Care Sols., Inc. v.

When conducting a NEPA-triggering project in the Everglades area, \nthe federal government is required to coordinate with the Tribe, who has occupancy rights \nin BCNP, conducts preservation and restoration activities in the area, and historically has \naided federal agencies with their environmental reviews. See (Tribe Ex. 21 at IV-7; Tribe \nEx. 22 at 209, 213, 216; Tribe Ex. 23 at 193; DE 129 at 73, 113 (testifying about the \nTribe’s occupancy rights in BCNP and the Everglades National Park)). Over the past \ndecade, the Army Corps of Engineers has faithfully followed these protocols during the \nplanning and execution of WERP. When notices of NEPA projects go to the Tribe, they \nare sent to the Tribe’s administration building, located in Miami-Dade County. The Tribe’s \nenvironmental divisions work out of that building in coordination with federal agencies to \ncreate  environmental  impact  statements  (“EIS”).  The  same  holds  true  for  ICE’s \nconsultation of other relevant environmental groups. See (Pl. Ex. 154 (describing ICE’s \nconsultation with the Everglades National Park regarding its proposed expansion of the \nICE Krome SPC detention facility)). In this case, proof of the facts that no EIS was created \nand the Tribe was never consulted comes from the testimony of Tribal members and \nemployees, whose employment is based in Miami-Dade. (DE 129 at 33–34, 45 (testifying \nto Defendants’ failure to contact the Tribe before moving forward with the project, in \ncontrast to agencies’ usual protocol of consultation)). See Morgan, 403 F. Supp. 2d at \n1123 (recognizing that the source of the proof at trial is an indicator of the location of \nApp.145\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 38 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 175 of 226 \nsubstantial events and omissions giving rise to a claim).  \n  Next, though not a dispositive consideration on its own, the locus of possible \nenvironmental harms within this district is relevant, particularly where Plaintiffs must show \nthat the project “significantly affect[s] the quality of the human environment” in order to \nprevail on their NEPA claim. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d 1563, 1572 (11th Cir. \n1994) (quoting § 4332(a)(C)). To begin with, increased runoff from the 800,000 square \nfeet of new paving and any wastewater from the site is likely to flow southeast, where just \na few miles from the site in Miami-Dade, eighty percent of Tribal members reside, Tribal \nschools are located, and the Tribe’s administration building sits. (DE 113 at 24, 79; DE \n129 at 16, 34, 45; Tribe Ex. 6 (tribal villages map)). This increased runoff creates risks of \ncarcinogens entering the Tribe’s water supply and of sediment and nutrients impacting \nthe plant and wildlife in the areas within Miami-Dade that the Tribe uses for hunting, \nfishing, and gathering certain plants. (DE 113 at 79; DE 129 at 107–08, 118–19). This \nchange to the quantity and consistency of runoff also risks disrupting the $20 billion \nWERP, which involves culverts and other infrastructure to manage the flow of water into \nsensitive wetlands conservation areas in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. (Pl. Ex. 34; \nDE 129 at 22–30). \nOther  harms  in  Miami-Dade  include  light  pollution  from  the  camp’s  intense \nindustrial lighting, which obstructs views of the night sky in Miami-Dade. See (DE 24-4 \n(depicting the light emanating from the site from 15 miles away in Miami-Dade); DE 114 \nat 309 (“it looks like we have a sports stadium in our backyard now”); Tribe Ex. 9 at 8–35 \n(measuring and documenting the increased sky brightness due to the project)).

Further, since Defendants have altered \nthe site’s use, Tribal members have also been unable to access the main trails leading \ninto the BCNP lands within Miami-Dade for hunting and cultural and ceremonial activities, \nas those trailheads are directly adjacent to the site.

These \nharms and others giving rise to Plaintiffs’ NEPA claim, are relevant to the request for \ninjunctive relief, and support venue in this district.   \n  Defendants argue that Friends of Earth v. Haaland, counsels against this result. \n(DE 65 at 8 (discussing Friends of Earth v. Haaland, 2022 WL 185196, at *2-4 (D.D.C. \nJan. 20, 2022))). As that court noted, “[i]n cases brought under the APA, courts generally \nfocus  on  where  the  decision[-]making  process  occurred  to  determine  where  claims \narose.” Friends of Earth, 2022 WL 185196, at *3. But in that case, as in most NEPA cases, \nthe court was reviewing a single discrete agency decision—a Record of Decision made \nin Washington, D.C. rescinding agency approval for new oil and natural gas leases in the \nGulf of Mexico—and its relationship to the Western District of Louisiana. Id. at *1. Also in \nthat case, as in most NEPA cases, the court was tasked with reviewing a significant record \nof meetings, studies, and EIS’s to decide whether the decision-making process was \nsufficient under  NEPA.  Id. at  *3–4  (discussing  the  locations  of  the  agency’s  public \ncomment process, issuances of multiple EISs and a Record of Decision, and of dozens \nof studies). Under those circumstances, because nearly all of the acts comprising the \nNEPA process took place outside of the district in question, the court in Friends of Earth \nconcluded venue there was improper. Id. at *4.  \nBut this case is not the usual NEPA case. Here, Plaintiffs do not challenge a new \nrule or Record of Decision, which may be traceable to discrete moments of decision-\nApp.147\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 40 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 177 of 226 \nmaking, but a project comprised of many “systematic and connected agency decisions[.]” \n40 C.F.R. § 1508.18(3) (describing the adoption of programs as a category of major \nfederal action). Here, there is no record of a NEPA process taking place in other districts \nbecause Defendants did not engage with a single step of the environmental review \nprocess in any district. Consequently, the Court’s review under NEPA necessarily focuses \non where studies should have been done and where interested parties should have been \nconsulted but were not.19  \nDefendants say the Court’s inquiry should be confined to Defendants’ decisions \nabout  project  construction,  which  they  say  took  place  in  either  Washington  D.C., \nTallahassee, Florida, or Collier County. This may be true (though the only supporting \nevidence Defendants have provided is one conclusory statement from a FDEM employee \nsaying “[a]ll substantial decision-making about the detention facility has occurred at either \nState offices in Tallahassee, Florida, or on-site in Collier County, Florida”). (DE 50-1 ¶ 4 \n(declaration of Ian Gadea-Guidicelli)). Yet other decisions relating to the setup of the \ncamp and its ongoing operations likely took place and continue to take place at the Miami \nfield office, which coordinates ICE’s oversight of the project’s immigration functions and \n19 Defendants’ reliance on Rodriguez-Diaz v. Donald is similarly misplaced. (DE 65 at 6, \n8, 9, 11 (citing Rodriguez-Diaz v. Donald, No. 14-cv-23055, 2015 WL 11217234 (S.D. \nFla.  Apr.  1,  2015)).  In  that  copyright  infringement  case,  this  Court  applied  in  a \nstraightforward manner the rule from Jenkins Brick that the focus of a Court’s inquiry \nunder § 1391(b)(2) should be on a defendant’s actions with a close nexus to the wrong. \nRodriguez-Diaz,  2015  WL  11217234,  at  *2.  And  because  the  defendant  DJ  had \nperformed and sold records in the S.D. Fla. while using an allegedly infringing nickname, \nvenue was proper even though those actions comprised a small share of the DJ’s overall \nsales and performances. Id. *1–2. Similarly, here, the Court has identified numerous \nactions and omissions by Defendants with a close nexus to the alleged NEPA violation, \nmaking venue proper even while many other aspects of the claim took place in other \ndistricts.  \nApp.148\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 41 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 178 of 226 \nthe facilities’ compliance with ICE standards. See infra pp. 35–36.  \nFinally, it is noteworthy that the Friends of Earth court did credit the location of the \nimpact of the agency’s decision as relevant, but said “impacts alone cannot create proper \nvenue. . . .[,] [p]articularly . . .  where the impacts of any decision will be felt nationwide.” \nId. at 5. In this case, impacts are localized to Miami-Dade (and some other counties), and \nthese impacts are but one of the many relevant ties to the district. Therefore, the Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs’ claims against the State and Federal Defendants are properly in this \ndistrict.  \n4.  Discretionary transfer under section 1404(a) \nFederal Defendants alternatively ask the Court to transfer the case to the M.D. \nFla., where the majority of the TNT site is located. (DE 60 at 6). They rightly argue that \nvenue is also appropriate there under § 1391(e)(1). (Id. at 6–7). But Federal Defendants \nare wrong in their assertions that the only important factor to weigh is “the local interest \nin having localized controversies decided at home,” (id. at 7 n.4), and that this factor cuts \nin favor of venue in M.D. Fla. (Id. at 8). \n  “[A] plaintiff’s choice of forum should be honored so long as venue is proper there, \nunless substantial countervailing considerations militate to the contrary.” Bartronics, Inc. \nv.

Additionally, the court should weigh “various \npublic-interest considerations,” including “the administrative difficulties flowing from court \ncongestion [and] the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home[.]” \nAtl. Marine Constr. Co., 571 U.S. at 62 n.6 (2013) (internal quotations omitted).  \nFederal Defendants argue that NEPA cases “are resolved on an [a]dministrative \n[r]ecord and therefore” convenience of parties and witnesses and other trial efficiency \nconsiderations “do not play a significant role for purposes of the venue analysis.” (DE 60 \nat 7 n.4). That may be true in a typical NEPA case, where the Parties agree that a given \nagency action was subject to NEPA, and the agency conducted some environmental \nanalysis under NEPA, so there is an administrative record for the Court’s review. But \nagain, this is not a typical NEPA case. Here, the Parties dispute whether the project is \neven a federal action, and no Defendant conducted any environmental analysis prior to \nbuilding and operating the project; the merits of the NEPA claim will require fact-finding \nas there is no administrative record to rely upon. Additionally, Plaintiffs request permanent \ninjunctive relief. As the case progress, Plaintiffs will need to marshal testimony from \nwitnesses  and  other  discovery  related  to  irreparable  harm  and  equities,  making \nconvenience of witnesses and access to evidence relevant considerations. And both of \nthese considerations—convenience and access—weigh in favor of keeping the case in \nthe S.D. Fla. For one, the S.D. Fla. provides the closest federal courthouse to the TNT \nApp.150\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 43 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 180 of 226 \nsite by 50 miles.20 Moreover, eighty percent of Tribal members live in Miami-Dade and \ntheir environmental resources division and tribal headquarters are based here. (DE 129 \nat 16, 34, 45; Tribe Ex. 6). Much of the evidence of environmental harms would also be \nderived from Miami-Dade. Further, Miami-Dade County owns the TNT site; property \nrecords, past site plans, ecological studies, and surveys are presumably located in  \nMiami-Dade.  \nNext, Defendants posit, without any support, that “the resolution of this case . . . \nwill have the greatest impact on the people and local governments of the Middle District[.]” \n(DE 60 at 8). But this is far from clear. Miami-Dade and other adjacent counties in the \nS.D. Fla. have similar, if not more compelling interests in the resolution of this case. Again, \nit cannot be overstated that Miami-Dade owns the site and certainly has a strong interest \nin how it is used. Some Miami-Dade residents live relatively close to the site and use the \nsurrounding areas for recreation. Tribal members have perhaps the most compelling \ninterest of any one demographic in how these claims are decided, and they are almost \nentirely local to Miami-Dade. This is not to say that residents in Collier County may not \nalso have a stake in the proceedings, but this factor does not clearly cut in favor of venue \nin the M.D. Fla.  \nGiven that the S.D. Fla. is undoubtedly the more convenient forum and public-\n20 According to a google maps search, the closest M.D. Fla. courthouse is 103 miles from \nTNT, while the closest S.D.

Plaintiffs have met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. \nAs stated above, to succeed on a motion for preliminary injunction Plaintiffs must \nshow: “(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the preliminary \ninjunction  is  necessary  to  prevent  irreparable  injury;  (3)  that  the  threatened  injury \noutweighs the harm the preliminary injunction would cause the other litigant; and (4) that \nthe preliminary injunction would not be averse to the public interest.” Gissendaner, 779 \nF.3d at 1280 (citation omitted); see also Winter v.

It \nis meant, among other goals, to “fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee \nof the environment[,]” and “preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of \nour national heritage[.]” § 4331(b)(1),(4). To those ends, NEPA requires that any “major \nFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” be preceded \nby and EIS, which studies foreseeable environmental impacts of the project, feasible \nalternatives, and other factors impacting the balance between NEPA’s objectives and the \nbenefits of the project. § 4332(C).23 The EIS process must be done in consultation with \n23 The agency may prepare a less intensive “environmental assessment [(“EA”)]” for \n“proposed agency action that does not have a reasonably foreseeable significant effect \non the quality of the human environment, or if the significance of such effect is unknown[.]” \n§ 4336(b)(2).

Id.  \nTying together the statutory language, the NEPA claim requires Plaintiffs to show \nthat the construction and/or use of the detention camp involves (1) a final agency action, \nand (2) a major Federal action, (3) without Defendants conducting a compliant EIS. See \nSierra Club v. Van Antwerp, 526 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir. 2008) (describing a court’s \n“review of agency decisions” under APA and NEPA as “determin[ing] whether the action \nto be taken constitutes a ‘major Federal action’—that is, an action ‘significantly affecting \nthe quality of the human environment’”— and reviewing for the presence and sufficiency \nof an EIS under the APA’s arbitrary and capricious standard); see also Seven Cnty. \nInfrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cnty., 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1511 (2025) (describing a NEPA \nclaim as “argu[ing] that an agency action was arbitrary and capricious due to a deficiency \nin an EIS”). \nDefendants do not dispute that the camp and its operations have a sufficient \nimpact on the quality of the human environment to be considered “major,” justifying the \nneed for an EIS. Indeed, the Court reviewed plans and photos showing that operation of \nthe camp, to date, has involved paving approximately 800,000 square feet of land, \ninstallation of industrial lighting impacting the night sky at least 20 to 30 miles away, and \nenough residential infrastructure to house thousands of detainees and on-site staff. (Pl. \nExs. 22, 90–92 (Dr. McVoy report of new asphalting and TNT site plans); Tribe Ex. 9 \nthat an EA “shall be a concise public document prepared by a Federal agency to set forth \nthe basis of such agency’s finding of no significant impact or determination that an \nenvironmental impact statement is necessary”). \nApp.154\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 47 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 184 of 226 \n(lighting report)). The camp employs as many as 1,000 staff members, many of whom \nreside on site, and can house multiple thousands of detainees at any given time. (DE 113 \nat 28, 33–34). Additionally, the project involves the daily movement of human waste, \nsewage, jet fuel, and significant vehicular traffic. (DE 38-5 (TDF Waste Management \nPlan)). In fact, several environmental experts opined that they expect the project will have \nconsiderable environmental impacts and would have required review by relevant federal \nagencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (DE 113 at 49 (Dr. McVoy opining \nthat he would have expected an EIS to be done before the facility’s construction based \non his experience with NEPA); DE 114 at 240 (testimony from Kautz that he “would have \nexpected consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for impacts, potential \nimpacts on the Florida panther, as well as other listed species in the area.”); DE 129 at \n130, 141 (testimony from Dr. Bozas that he expects there to be “effects on wildlife in the \narea” based “on the current level of human activity at the TNT [s]ite” and that the project’s \nincreased lighting would have required review by Fish and Wildlife Service due to its \nimpact on the bonneted bat’s critical habitat zone)); see also Hanly v.

Avoiding a discussion of environmental impacts and notice, \nthe Defendants instead say that there has been no final federal agency action. The Court \ntakes up these two issues next.  \na.  Final Agency Action \nCourts employ a two-part test to determine whether an agency action is “final” (and \ntherefore reviewable) under the APA. “First, the action must mark the consummation of \nthe  agency’s  decision[-]making  process—it  must  not  be  of  a  merely  tentative  or \ninterlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations \nhave been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotations omitted). To be a final agency action, the \nchallenged action must be one that represents “the agency's definitive position, affects \nthe parties' legal rights or obligations, and immediately impacts the regulated parties' daily \noperations.” RB Jai Alai, LLC v.

Franklin, 505 U.S. at 797 \n(alterations accepted and internal quotations omitted). The question before the Court is \nwhether the decision-making process, with respect to the detention camp, has advanced \nto the point where it has had a sufficiently direct and immediate impact on the parties’ \nrights and therefore qualifies as a reviewable final agency action. As discussed below, \nthe Court concludes that it has. \nAs  a  threshold  matter,  the  construction  of  the  camp  does  not  represent  a \npreliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling. Although it apparently \nlacks basic forethought in many ways, the facility has undergone substantial construction \nand is currently operational. Indeed, as Plaintiffs allege, the State and Federal Defendants \ncoordinated to “construct a mass migrant detention and deportation center” and have \ncompleted “the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services \nsystems, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, [and] diesel power generators.” \nApp.157\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 50 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 187 of 226 \n(DE 1 at 17).  \nPrior to such construction, however, the Defendants were required, under NEPA, \nto issue an EIS or conduct an EA. The Defendants chose not to do so. Under the APA, \nthe “failure to act” qualifies as an “agency action.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). The Defendants’ \ndecision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention \ncamp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected \nPlaintiffs’  recreational,  conservational,  and  aesthetic  interests.  Accordingly,  the \nDefendants’ decision to not issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention \ncamp qualifies as a final agency action. See Hall v.

Under  the \nstatutory language, the Defendants cannot put the cart before the horse—they cannot \nconstruct a facility and, then only in response to litigation such as the instant case, decide \nto fulfill their legal obligations.  \nNext, the decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA has directly impacted the \nrights of the Parties in this matter. As part of the EIS process, members of the public are \nafforded opportunities to comment on the proposed environmental action. During the \nPreliminary Injunction Hearing, Friends members and Tribe employees emphatically \nstated that they would have provided such comments. Instead, they lost the right to do so \nwhen Defendants refused to comply with their statutory obligations. See (DE 114 at  \n24 Under wholly disparate circumstances, some courts have stated that an “agency’s \ndecision not to prepare an EIS pursuant to the NEPA does not constitute a final agency \naction.” Karst, 403 F. Supp. 2d at 81 n.3 (citing Pub. Citizen v. Office of U.S. Trade \nRepresentatives, 970 F.2d 916, 918 (D.C. Cir. 1992)); see also Coalition for Underground \nExpansion v.

Cir. 2003) (when challenged Metrolink \nproject  had  not  yet  been  built  or  federally  funded,  Federal  Transit  Administration’s \ndecision not to conduct an environmental review did not “itself” constitute a final agency \naction). These cases stand for the unremarkable proposition that an EIS alone is not a \nfinal agency action where no “NEPA-triggering” major federal action has already occurred \nand where administrative processes are ongoing. Citizens for Clean Energy, 384 F. Supp. \n3d at 1280–81; see Public Citizen, 970 F.2d at 918 (Trade Representative’s failure to \nconduct an EIS prior to engaging in trade negotiations was “not itself a final agency action” \nin the absence of some “specific proposal for legislation or other action at least arguably \ntriggering the agency’s obligation to prepare an impact statement”) (internal quotation \nomitted).  By  contrast,  here,  the  detention  camp’s  construction  and  existence  are \nundisputed. In this context, the decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA is a final \nagency action. \nApp.159\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 52 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 189 of 226 \n55–56,  74).  Besides  this  lost  engagement  opportunity,  Plaintiffs’  relationship  to  the \nPreserve—recreationally, or as conservationists—was also compromised by Defendants’ \nfailure to issue an EIS or conduct an EA. For example, Plaintiffs’ expert, Randy Kautz \ntestified that the Florida panther has lost 2,000 acres of habitat as a result of the facility’s \nconstruction and use of intense lights disturbing the habitats of these nocturnal creatures. \nSee (DE 114 at 232). Moreover, several witnesses testified about how the facility’s light \npollution  has adversely  affected their ability  to  observe  the night  sky.25  (Id. at  34). \nAccordingly, because the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an EIS \nor conducting an EA is a definitive position which has caused actual, concrete injury to \nthe Plaintiffs’ recreational and conservational interests, the Court finds that the action was \na final agency action. \nNo Defendant has endeavored to explain their decision to abstain from issuing an \nEIS or conducting an EA. Instead, the Federal Defendants contend that “[n]either ICE nor \nFEMA has implemented, directed, or controlled the construction work at the temporary \ndetention center.” (DE 21 at 3). This contention runs contrary to significant evidence \nPlaintiffs have adduced that the facility’s construction was requested and fully funded by \nthe federal government. See infra Section III.C.1.b. Instead of addressing the failure to \nissue an EIS or conduct an EA as a final agency action, Defendants attempt to reframe \nthe issue as one involving the detention camp’s ultimate funding. Defendants point to the \nfact that the detention camp’s construction costs have been initially shouldered by Florida \n25 Big Cypress National Preserve is recognized as an International Dark Sky Park and \noffers visitors a unique opportunity to observe the Milky Way with their naked eyes.

Accordingly, Defendants \nargue that the “reimbursement decision . . . has not yet been made . . . [and] there cannot \nbe final agency action.” (DE 16 at 11). However, the Court does not, and is not, compelled \nto focus on the funding decision, since the lack of an EIS and EA qualifies as final agency \naction given Federal Defendants’ intimate involvement in, and control over, the detention \nfacility. See Sw. Williamson Cnty. Cmty. Ass’n, Inc. v. Slater, 243 F.3d 270, 279 (6th Cir. \n2001)  (“major  federal  actions  need  not  be  federally  funded  to  invoke  NEPA \nrequirements”).  \nb.  Major Federal Action \nSection 4336e(10) of NEPA defines “major federal action” as an action that “is \nsubject to substantial Federal control and responsibility.” It excludes non-federal action \n“with no or minimal Federal funding” and “no or minimal Federal involvement where a \nFederal agency cannot control the outcome of the project[.]” 42 U.S.C. § 4336e(10)(B)(i). \nNEPA implementing regulations promulgated by the Council on Environment Quality \nreiterate this definition in the affirmative, defining “Major Federal action [as] actions with \neffects that may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control and \nresponsibility.” 40 C.F.R. §1508.18. According to that regulation, federal actions “include \nnew and continuing activities, including projects and programs entirely or partly financed, \nassisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies[.]” § 1508.18(a).  \nThough “federal courts have not agreed on the amount of federal involvement \nnecessary to trigger the applicability of NEPA,” the Eleventh Circuit has had occasion to \nanalyze the issue. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1572. In that case, the Eleventh \nCircuit  analyzed  whether  the  Federal  government  negotiating  and  administering  a \nApp.161\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 54 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 191 of 226 \nsettlement agreement with Florida agencies responsible for insuring water quality in the \nEverglades constituted major federal action. Id. at 1568, 1572 (“We must determine \nwhether . . . sufficient federal involvement exists in what is proposed in the Settlement \nAgreement to constitute major federal action affecting the environment under NEPA.”). \nThe focus of the court’s analysis was “on the federal agencies’ control and responsibility \nover material aspects of the specific project.” Id. at 1572. As the court explained, “[t]he \ntouchstone of major federal activity constitutes a federal agency’s authority to influence \nnonfederal  activity.  ‘The  federal  agency  must  possess  actual  power  to  control  the \nnonfederal activity.’” Id. (quoting Sierra Club v. Hodel, 848 F.2d 1068, 1089 (10th Cir. \n1988)); see also Goos v. I.C.C., 911 F.2d 1283, 1294 (8th Cir. 1990) (“In deciding whether \na federal agency exercises legal control, we must therefore consider whether some \nfederal action is a legal condition precedent to accomplishment of an entire nonfederal \nproject.”) (internal quotations omitted). \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected the notion that the federal government’s power to \ninfluence  state  action  through  “advocacy  and  negotiation”  in  litigation  or  “invok[ing] \ndispute resolution mechanisms” in resulting settlements is “synonymous with a federal \nagency’s authority to exercise control over a nonfederal project.” Id. at 1572–73. Instead, \nwhat matters is whether the “state agencies retain their state law authority to make the \ndecisions concerning the project,” or, in other words, whether project or program in \nquestion is implemented “pursuant to existing authority under Florida law[.]” Id. at 1573.  \nDefendants argue that the decision in S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist. advises against \nfinding  major  federal  action  here  because  the  Federal  Defendants  have  not  yet \nreimbursed the State for construction costs of the project and “Plaintiffs offer no evidence \nApp.162\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 55 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 192 of 226 \nthat the federal government is controlling the State’s construction on State land.” (DE 16 \nat 8). The Court will discuss the Defendants’ untenable claims regarding funding shortly. \nSee infra pp. 62–64. But more critically, Defendants ignore the reality that all immigration \nenforcement  activities  associated  with  the  camp—key  drivers  of  the  project’s \nenvironmental impact—are entirely under federal control and pursuant to federal law.26  \nGiven that the camp acts exclusively as “an immigration detention facility,” (DE 105 \nat 18), any state officials working on site with detainees are doing so as deputized federal \nimmigration officers pursuant to 287(g) agreements. See (Pl. Ex. 144 at 5 (official post of \nFDHSMV announcing 287(g) agreement and deputized FHP troopers “ICE Task Force \nOfficers”)). Those officers “are not authorized to perform immigration officer functions \nexcept when working under the supervision and direction of ICE personnel.” Supra \nSection I.B. Under the agreements, the actions of those officials “will be reviewed by the \nICE supervisory officers on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with the requirements \nof the immigration laws and procedures.” Id. This alone provides the requisite “federal \nauthority” over the project required under S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist.  \n26 To the extent Defendants seek to disaggregate the camp’s initial authorization and \nconstruction from its ongoing operations and argue that the project is not federal if the \ninitial aspects of the project were state-run, NEPA’s pragmatic paradigm does not allow \nfor evasion of responsibility by parsing agency actions in this artificially atomistic way. \nSee e.g., Okeelanta Corp. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 132 F.4th 1320, (11th Cir. 2025) \n(“An agency cannot evade its responsibilities under [NEPA] by artificially dividing a major \nfederal action into smaller components”) (internal quotations omitted); Chilkat v.

The camp operates using “ICE detention \nstandards.” (DE 21-1 ¶ 5); see also supra Section I.B. (documenting the requirement in \nthe operative 287(g) agreements that “the policies and procedures to be utilized by the \nparticipating [state] personnel in exercising [immigration functions] shall be DHS and ICE \npolicies  and  procedures,  including  the  ICE  Use  of  Force  Policy”);  C.M.  v.  Noem,  \n25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 57 at 272 (facility’s visitation policy stating it adheres to \nICE/ERO policy and operates in “in coordinate with ICE/ERO’s public affairs objectives). \nIn all of its 287(g) agreements with Florida agencies, ICE is also “responsible for the \ninstallation  and  maintenance  of  the  Information  Technology  (IT)  infrastructure”  and \nrequires that any agency with access to its systems follow its “Sensitive System Policy \nand Rules of Behavior.” C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 53-1 at 5, 19, 50, \n66, 81, 96, 111, 126. Consequently, the IT systems at the camp were installed by ICE \nand are under federal control.  \nFurther, ICE directs arresting law enforcement officers whether to take people into \ncustody  on  suspicion  of  immigration  violations,  (DE  129  at  187,  213);  ICE  “makes \ndecisions regarding transfer into [the facility] based on the posture of aliens’ immigration \nproceedings,” C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 50-1 ¶ 6 (declaration of Juan \nLopez Vega); ICE “maintains custody” of the detainees, (Pl. Ex. 43 at 4 (SERT South \nFlorida Detention Facility Continuity of Operations Plan)); and it is federal officials who \nphysically transport detainees on and off site and conduct deportations using federally-\nowned aircraft. See (DE 114 at 97 (testimony of Representative Eskamani that she \nobserved ICE vehicles dropping off detainees and that Director Guthrie confirmed this \nwas the standard protocol); id. at 312–14 (testimony of Jessica Namath that she observed \nApp.164\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 57 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 194 of 226 \nICE-contracted and Customs and Border Protection vehicles transporting between ICE \nKrome SPC detention facility and the TNT site); DE 129 at 203, 214–15 (testimony of \nDirector Kerner that either federal agencies or contractors, not state agencies, transport \ndetainees to and from the TNT site, and federal agencies are conducting the deportations \nusing federally-owned airplanes); Pl. Ex. 59 (video of Customs and Border Protection \nvans leaving the site); DE 24-2 (photo of DHS transport bus exiting the TNT site)). \nThat the deputized officers’ regular salaries are paid, required uniforms are bought, \nand standard work hours are controlled by their state agency supervisors is not germane \nto questions involving the TNT facility, because their status there as deputized officers \nand their activities at the camp are controlled by ICE. See e.g., (DE 129 at 225–27 \n(testimony of Director Kerner); DE 118-1 ¶ 13 (describing the ways in which state agency \nsupervisors retain control for non-immigration aspects of deputized officers’ employment); \nDE  118-1  ¶ 12  (“DHS  provides  credentials  and  guidance  to  local  law  enforcement \npartners, and signs warrants for service as needed. DHS is required to provide direction \nand supervision to local law enforcement officers when taking immigration enforcement \nactions”)); C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D.

The LEA retains supervision of all other aspects \nof the employment and performance of duties of participating LEA personnel.”); id. at 33 \n(providing that deputized officers “performing immigration-related duties pursuant to [the \n287(g) agreement] will be assigned to various units, teams, or task forces designated by \nICE”); id. at 34 (requiring that all candidates to become deputized immigration officers \n“must be approved by ICE”); id. at 35 (“The ICE supervisory officer . . . will evaluate the \nApp.165\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 58 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 195 of 226 \nactivities of all personnel certified under [a 287(g)].”).  \nNationwide, Courts have recognized the legal and practical reality that ‘“ICE is in \ncomplete control of detainees’ admission and release,’ while the [287(g) agreement] \n‘places  the [deputized  state  agents]  in  the  role  of  a  mere functionary.’” Masingene  \nv.

June 17, 2005).    \nDefendants next claim that “the ultimate decision of who to detain at the” camp \n“belongs to Florida,” and this precludes the project from being a federal action. (DE 21-1 \n¶ 6); DE 105 at 18 (positing that the State can “turn down anyone they want”)). For one, \nto be a major federal action, a project need not be under complete control by federal \nauthorities  in  all  respects,  but  merely  “subject  to  substantial  Federal  control  and \nresponsibility.”  42  U.S.C.  §  4336e(10(B)(i).  In  fact,  NEPA’s  statutory  language \ncontemplates projects that are led in large part by state entities but still trigger NEPA.  \n§ 4332 (G)(i) (allowing an EIS for certain “major Federal action[s]” to be prepared by a \nstate agency official if “the State agency or official has statewide jurisdiction and has the \nresponsibility for such action[.]”). Second, it is ICE that decides whether and where an \napprehended person will be detained for not having legal status. (DE 129 at 187). And if \nApp.166\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 59 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 196 of 226 \nFlorida  began  unilaterally  rejecting  large  swaths  of  detainees,  ICE  is  contractually \nauthorized to terminate the 287(g) agreement, which would lead to the shuttering of the \nfacility. See e.g., (DE 24-3 at 8–9 (287(g) agreement with FHP detailing the process for \nICE  to  terminate  the  agreement)).  Even  if  Florida  has  some  authority  to  reject  a \nprospective detainee, the fact that the federal government is responsible for selecting the \npool of prospective detainees and transporting them to the camp gives the federal \ngovernment significant control over who is housed there.  \nDefendants make a few additional arguments in their ill-considered attempt to \navoid the implications of the project’s federal activities, but each fails. First, Defendants \nsay the detention activities are not reviewable under the APA, § 702(a)(2), because DHS \nsecretary has discretion over detainees’ detention locations under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1). \n(DE 16 at 12). But “[t]he question for §701(a)(2) purposes is whether there is ‘no law to \napply’ for the exercise of discretion being challenged.” Mass. Coal. for Immgr. Reform  \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 698 F. Supp. 3d 10, 37 (D.D.C. 2023). It “does not matter \nwhether the Government has discretion [over detention locations] or not. That question is \nnot before the Court” in a NEPA claim. Id. “What is before the Court is the decision not to \ncomply with NEPA” . . . . [a]nd on that, the Government has no discretion.” Id. (citing \nCalvert Cliffs’ Coordinating Comm. v. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm’n, 449 F.2d 1109, 1114 \n(D.C. Cir. 1971)).  \nNext, Defendants argue the operations of the site fall into a NEPA exemption for \n“bringing  judicial  or  administrative  civil  or  criminal  enforcement  actions[.]”  \n§  4336e(10)(B)(v);  see  also  (DE 105 at 21).  The  construction and  operation of an \nimmigration detention facility is plainly not an enforcement action. Compare Mass. Coal. \nApp.167\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 60 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 197 of 226 \nfor Immgr. Reform v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 698 F. Supp. 3d 10, 20 (D.D.C. 2023) \n(DHS’s  “return  to  Mexico”  immigration  policy  did  not  meet  the  NEPA  “enforcement \naction[]” exemption because it “goes well beyond the decision whether to enforce the law \nin individual cases”), with Sierra Club v. Penfold, 857 F.2d 1037, 1313 (9th Cir. 1988) \n(describing the agency’s right to “issue notices of noncompliance” and then “commence \nenforcement proceedings” as coming within the enforcement action exemption), Civil \nAction, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (a legal action “brought to enforce, redress, \nor protect a private or civil right”). In recognition of this, in 2024 DHS performed a NEPA \nevaluation before ICE’s expansion of the Krome detention facility. See (Pl. Ex. 154). \nFinally, Defendants argue that “even if Florida is exercising federal power when it \ndecides where to detain, the APA turns on whether a federal agency is making the \ndecision not whether federal power is being exercised.” (DE 130 at 108). But Defendants’ \npremise  fails.  The  evidence  and  legal  framework  governing  deputized  state  law \nenforcement agents’ immigration activities make clear that they are not only exercising \nfederal authority; their conduct is controlled by ICE. Consequently, the cases Defendants \ncite have no bearing on the issue. Neither applies NEPA’s major federal action standard \nnor discusses the state-federal relationship in immigration enforcement. See Lebron v. \nNat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 397, 399 (1995) (holding Amtrak was “part of \nthe Government for purposes of the First Amendment”); Ritter v. Cecil Cnty. Off. of Hous. \nand Comm. Dev., 33 F.3d 323, 327–28 (4th Cir. 1994) (interpretation of HUD regulation \nby local housing board is reviewed under something like Skidmore deference, not the \nAPA’s arbitrary and capricious standard). Defendants attempt to seize on dicta, in which \nJustice Scalia mentioned that an entity’s status as a federal agency can be defined by \nApp.168\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 61 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 198 of 226 \nstatute “for purposes of . . . whether it is subject to statutes that impose obligations or \nconfer powers upon Government entities, such as the [APA][.]“ Id. at 392. The closest \nanalog to this situation is § 1357(g)(7)–(8), where Congress specified that deputized \nofficers  are  “acting  under  color  of  Federal  authority”  when  performing  immigration \nfunctions under a 278(g) agreement. But it is worth noting Justice Scalia’s pronouncement \nin Lebron that “[i]t surely cannot be that government, state or federal, is able to evade the \nmost solemn obligations imposed in the Constitution by simply resorting to the corporate \nform.” Lebron, 513 U.S. at 397. \nThe Federal Defendants’ control over operations at the camp should suffice to end \nthe analysis. However, evidence that the project was built at the Federal Defendants’ \nrequest and that federal funding has been committed to the State for the entire cost of \nthe project both support the conclusion that the Federal Defendants were “so intimately \ninvolved in the discussion and planning” of the project that they “cannot now claim to have \nno responsibility under NEPA[.]” Fund for Animals v. Clark, 27 F. Supp. 2d 8, 13 (D.D.C. \n1998).   \nFDEM has acknowledged in its own written materials about the camp that it was \nbuilt  after  “DHS  and  [FEMA]  request[ed]  the  State  of  Florida  to  supplement  [its \nimmigration enforcement] capacity with a temporary detention facility.” (Pl.

These statements align with those of other high level public officials. ICE \nField Officer Director Garrett Rippa described the project as “state, local, and federal \npartners working in unison, working as one” and promised that ICE “will continue to utilize \nApp.169\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 62 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 199 of 226 \nth[e] facility.” (Pl. Ex. 61 at 0:25–1:01). DHS Secretary Noem explained that the project \nwas conceived when her general counsel “called up Florida’s Attorney General and \nGovernor” and requested they partner with DHS to build the detention center. (Pl. Ex. 63 \nat 0:05–0:32). Governor DeSantis said the same: the project was “requested by the \nfederal government.”27 Defendants argue that “a local plan does not become a major \nfederal action subject to NEPA regulations merely upon its approval by a federal agency.” \nRattlesnake, 509 F.3d at 1102. But Defendants fail to recognize that the situation in \nRattlesnake—“[t]he  development  and  improvement  of  sewage  treatment  by  a \nmunicipality[—]is intrinsically a local matter under the responsibility of local government.” \nId. Here, it is beyond peradventure that the detention of undocumented persons and \ndecision as to their ongoing status is a uniquely federal question under the authority, \ncontrol, and supervision of the federal government.  \nAdditionally, the Federal Defendants acknowledge that DHS “announced $600 \nmillion in federal funding for the Detention Support Grant Program” and the “only eligible \napplicant  .  .  .  is  the  Florida  Division of  Emergency  Management.” (DE  21-2 at  2) \n(declaration of David Richardson) (emphasis added). Governor DeSantis confirmed that \nthe federal government will “fully fund” the facility.28 And Secretary Noem posted on social \nmedia that “Alligator Alcatraz will be funded largely by FEMA’s Shelter and Services \n27 Fox 35 Orlando, ‘Alligator Alcatraz’: Florida Gov.

Ex.  144  ¶  5).  Furthermore,  Assistant  United  States  Attorneys  made \nrepresentations in court that “[t]he Everglade[s] detention facility is being funded from a \ncontinuing resolution for [fiscal year] 2025” of the Shelter and Services Program. See City \nof Chicago v. DHS, 25-cv-05463 (N.D. Ill.), ECF 35 at 1–2.  \nDespite  these  clear  and  unequivocal  public  assertions  of  federal  funding, \nDefendants would have this Court find that a “reimbursement decision . . . has not yet \nbeen made.” To reach this conclusion, however, would require the Court to disregard \nthese unambiguous statements from government representatives. Instead, taking all of \nthis context into consideration, it is apparent that the reimbursement funding decision has \nin fact been made.  \nIn Scottsdale Mall v. State of Indiana, the court had no difficulty in concluding the \nhighway project at issue was a major federal action when “the record indicate[d] federal \nparticipation in the programming, location, design, preliminary engineering, and right of \nway acquisition stages.” Scottsdale Mall v. Indiana, 549 F.2d 484, 489 (7th Cir. 1977). In \nthat case, the state claimed it would “refund” monies to the federal government that had \nbeen committed to a segment of the project. Id. at 487. This, the state argued, gave it the \n“prerogative to avoid compliance with NEPA.” Id. at 488. The court rejected this argument, \nnoting that “[s]uch accounting transfer of federal funds from one state project to another \nunder the guise of ‘refund’ have been viewed with disfavor[.]” Id. at 487 n.5. The court \nfound that  where a  state  takes  “substantial  steps”  to  program a  project  for  federal \nassistance, it cannot “withdraw the program from federal funding consideration with a \nresulting  avoidance  of  complying  with  federal  environmental  statutes.”  Id.  at  488. \nSimilarly, the Defendants’ legal legerdemain regarding funding does not convince the \nApp.171\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 64 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 201 of 226 \nCourt.  As  the  Tribe’s  counsel  argued:  “If  this  is  allowed,  effectively,  the  [f]ederal \n[g]overnment is laundering federal control or federal approval through a grant program \nwith only one applicant who’s eligible to receive the money. And if that’s allowed, then \n[NEPA] is effectively useless[.]” (DE 130 at 131). \nIn light of the conclusion that the funding decision has been made, the Defendants’ \ncases are unpersuasive. In S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., for example, the Eleventh Circuit \nstated, “[t]he possibility that federal funding will be provided in the future is not sufficient \nto federalize a state project, even when such funding is likely.” 28 F.3d at 1573. Thus, \nDefendants argued at the Preliminary Injunction Hearing that the possibility of federal \nfunding for the detention camp precludes any finding of a reviewable, final federal agency \naction. As the Court explained supra, however, the instant matter goes well beyond a \npossibility. Unlike S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., this case does not involve hypothetical \nproposals  that  may  never  materialize.  Instead,  the  evidence  demonstrates  that  the \ndetention  camp  was constructed at the  request  of  the  federal government,  with its \ncooperation and counsel, and with specifically earmarked funds to reimburse any state \nexpenditures. The instant matter is not a situation where the State is applying to a general \nprogram from which it may or may not receive reimbursement since, as the “only eligible \napplicant,” the only “competition” they face in receiving the award is the State’s decision \non when it will be conferred.29 \n29 Defendants point the Court to cases involving grant programs that were generally open \nto applicants and instances where the grantors had not made final decisions as to the \ngrants. See, e.g., Karst Envtl. Educ. & Prot., Inc. v. EPA, 403 F. Supp. 2d 74, 81 (D.D.C. \n2005) (concluding that there was no final agency action where HUD had yet to consider \nand approve a grant application for disbursal of appropriated funds because “the federal \nmoney is but an expectancy that has not yet materialized”) (citation and internal quotation \nmarks  omitted);  Rattlesnake  Coal.  v.  EPA,  509  F.3d  1095,  1103  (9th  Cir.  2007) \nApp.172\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 65 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 202 of 226 \nDefendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because \nits employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the \nfederal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some \nunidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated. Meanwhile, the project was \nrequested  by  the  federal  government;  built  with  a  promise  of  full  federal  funding; \nconstructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force \nOfficers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE \nofficials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal \nimmigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and \ndeported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the \ncamp is a major federal action, the Court will “adhere to the time-tested adage: if it walks \nlike a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.” Van Antwerp, 526 \nF.3d at 1359.  \nDefendants make a final argument that, even if the Court finds Defendants have \nviolated NEPA, Plaintiffs should not receive the injunction they request because the Court \nmay “call for a remand without vacatur.” (DE 16 at 13–14). “[V]acatur is the ordinary APA \n(explaining that “[t]he congressional appropriation to the EPA of funds for a particular \nproject does not constitute a final agency action by the EPA until the EPA has reviewed \na grant application and decided to disburse the funds.”) The Court finds that these cases \nare factually inapposite. Karst, for instance, involved the award of a federal grant to a \nstate  agency  for  the  purpose  of  developing  an  industrial  complex.  In  Karst,  HUD \nrepresentatives  explained  that  “it  had  taken  some  action  with  respect  to  the  grant \napplication, but that it ha[d] not yet ‘obligated’ the money.” Karst, 403 F. Supp.2d at 81. \nAccordingly, the federal funding was “but an expectancy that [had] not yet materialized.” \nId. Unlike the instant case, however, that grant program did not appear to be designed \nspecifically for the grantee but was a general program from which the grantee sought \ndisbursement. In the instant case, there is not just an “expectancy” of federal funding—\nelected officials stated in unambiguous terms that the reimbursement would happen.   \nApp.173\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 66 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 203 of 226 \nremedy,” but the Court has discretion to remand an agency action without vacatur, leaving \nthe agency’s action in place while it completes a satisfactory NEPA evaluation. Black \nWarrior Riverkeeper, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 781 F.3d 1271, 1290 (11th Cir. \n2015) (alterations accepted) (quoting Antwerp, 526 F.3d at 1369). The considerations \ncourts weigh in this decision make clear why a vacatur without remand is inappropriate \nhere. Those are “the seriousness of the [agency] order’s deficiencies (and thus the extent \nof doubt whether the agency chose correctly) and the disruptive consequences of an \ninterim change that may itself be changed.” Id.  \nHere, there weren’t “deficiencies” in the agency’s process. There was no process. \nThe Defendants consulted with no stakeholders or experts and did no evaluation of the \nenvironmental risks and alternatives from which the Court may glean the likelihood that \nthe agency would choose the same course if it had done a NEPA-compliant evaluation. \nIt will come as no surprise that every case Defendants cite where the court remanded \nwithout vacatur involved a meaningful evaluative process by the agency before their final \naction. See e.g., Port Isabel v. Fed. Energy Regul. Comm’n, 130 F.4th 1034, 1037  \n(D.C. Cir. 2025) (“The Commission has already issued extensive final environmental \nimpact statements reflecting more than three years of review and public comment.”); Ctr. \nfor Biological Diversity v.

Further,  given  Defendants’  commitments  to  protecting  the  Everglades, \nApp.174\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 67 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 204 of 226 \nbacked by tens of billions of dollars in funding for preservation and restoration projects \nnear the TNT site, the Court assumes a thorough review of environmental impacts and \nalternatives could yield meaningful insights.  \n2.  Irreparable injury \nEven when Plaintiffs show they likely suffered the procedural harm of a NEPA \nviolation, they must also “demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an \ninjunction.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis omitted). “An injury is irreparable only if it \ncannot be undone through monetary remedies.” Ferrero v. Assoc. Materials Inc., 923 F.2d \n1441, 1449 (11th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation omitted). And “[o]ngoing harm to the \nenvironment[,]”  including  “when  a  project  may  significantly  degrade  some  human \nenvironmental factor,” “constitutes irreparable harm warranting an injunction.” Env. Prot. \nInf. Ctr. v. Carlson, 968 F.3d 985, 991 (9th Cir. 2020) (internal quotation omitted); see \nalso Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 545 (1987) (“Environmental injury, \nby its nature, can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is often \npermanent or at least of long duration, i.e., irreparable.”).   \nPlaintiffs identify a myriad of risks from the project to the wetlands and endangered \nspecies whose habitats include the area around the site. Plaintiffs also proved that runoff \nand  wastewater  discharge  from  the  camp  risks  polluting  the  water  supply  in  the \nMiccosukee Reserved Area—where eighty percent of Tribe members reside—just a few \nmiles downstream from the TNT site, and beyond. Finally, Plaintiffs show ongoing harms \nto organizational and Tribal members’ enjoyment of the preserved areas due to the \nproject’s industrial lighting, noise, traffic, and security perimeter.  \nFirst, the creation of 800,000 square feet of new impervious surface will increase \nApp.175\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 68 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 205 of 226 \nrunoff into the surrounding, interconnected wetlands, which threatens the “extremely \nsensitive . . .[,] low nutrient” hydrology of the Everglades. (DE 113 at 46–47). Dr. McVoy \ntestified that the Everglades and BCNP are peculiar and particularly sensitive in at least \ntwo ways: first they are interconnected wetlands that require “sheet flow,” meaning water \nflows with little obstruction across large areas, impacting the entire ecosystem;30 and \nsecond, they are “naturally very low nutrient level, and when you introduce nutrients, \nparticularly . . . phosphorous, nitrogen, potassium, it disturbs the ecosystem drastically.” \n(Id.). According to Dr. McVoy, the legal requirement for water introduced into the wetlands \nis quite low and that requirement is the result of “a lot of science that clearly demonstrated \nthe link that anything higher than that disturbs the system.” (Id. at 47). With the newly \npaved surface, “anything that falls in th[ose] 20 acres will go directly into the wetlands.” \n(Id. at 49). The possible contaminants in any runoff come “from a number of different \nsources” on the site. (DE 129 at 41). It could come from the paved material itself, from \npetroleum products on-site to fuel generators, from the vehicles and from thousands of \ndetainees and staff doing laundry, cooking, cleaning, using restrooms. (Id. at 41–42). \nBeyond contaminants entering the water, “increased sediment . . . in the wetlands \noftentimes leads to increased turbidity . . . [and] decrease[d] dissolved oxygen,” which \ncan kill aquatic animals. (DE 129 at 42, 136); see also (DE 5-2 ¶ 18 (declaring that the \nendangered Everglade snail kite relies on the “preserve’s aquatic ecosystem for survival” \nand would be harmed by the project’s wastewater and runoff)).    \nDefendants argue that they have mitigated these risks by installing silt fencing.  \n30 Plaintiffs introduced aerial footage of the natural wetlands surrounding the TNT site, \nwhich followed the unbreaking sheen of contiguous water below the thin layer of swamp \nvegetation, until the natural landscape was interrupted by TNT site. (Pl. Ex. 145).  \nApp.176\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 69 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 206 of 226 \nBut multiple Plaintiffs’ experts provided unrebutted testimony that that silt fencing “is not \nsuitable in the long-term to be able to reduce any storm water runoff that could potentially \naffect neighboring areas.” (DE 113 at 108). Especially in a large storm event, those \n“temporary structures . . . could be easily . . . toppled and allow for sediment and storm \nwater to pass through.” (Id. at 118). Given Defendants’ complete lack of other stormwater \nmanagement features, silt fencing is not “an appropriate substitute for a soil geologist \ndesigned storm water management system.” (Id.). Defendants also quibble with geologist \nDillon Reio’s calculation that the 800,000 square feet of new pavement would increase \nrunoff by almost “10 million gallons over a 72-hour, 100-year storm event[,]” attacking his \nassumptions regarding how permeable the now-paved area had originally been, given \nthat some of that area was compacted when the jetport was originally built. (Id. at 80,  \n95–104). But even if Defendants are correct that the true increase in peak discharge could \nbe some unknown lesser amount, there is sufficient likelihood that the increased runoff \nwill  harm  the  surrounding  wetlands  given  the  ecosystem’s  interconnectedness  and \nsensitivity to warrant preliminary injunctive relief. Plaintiffs are not required to prove harms \nof a particular probability or quantity, as “[p]art of the harm NEPA attempts to prevent in \nrequiring  an  EIS  is  that,  without  one,  there  may  be  little  if  any  information  about \nprospective environmental harms and potential mitigating measures.” Winter, 555 U.S. at \n23; see also Fla. Wildlife Fed’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 404 F. Supp. 2d 1352, 1362 \n(S.D. Fla. 2005) (“A fundamental purpose of NEPA is to ensure that important effects will \nnot be overlooked or underestimated only to be discovered after resources have been \nApp.177\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 70 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 207 of 226 \ncommitted or the die otherwise cast.”) (internal quotations omitted).31 To make matters \nworse, it appears Defendants have imminent plans to expand this paving significantly, as \nthey have already contracted to purchase 1.8 million square feet of asphalt. (Pl. Ex. 126 \nat 1 (purchase order for 200,000 square yards of asphalt)).32  \n These risks impact the wetlands ecosystem, but they also present direct risks to \ncommunities who depend on water from the Everglades for their water supply, including \nthe Tribe. As the Court has discussed, the overwhelming majority of Tribal life is enjoyed \nand experienced just a few miles southeast of the TNT site. Based on the general \ndirection of water flow in the area around the project, water from TNT site is likely to flow \ninto  the  Tribe’s  water  supply,  risking  contaminating  the  water  of  Tribal  residences, \nschools, the Tribe’s government building, and businesses. Water also “flows from the \njetport into Monroe County” and “Dade County” due to the connective features of the L28 \nCanal that were built under WERP. (DE 129 at 24–25). \nNext, the project creates irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased \nmortality to endangered species in the area. For example, Dr. Bozas testified that the \n31 Defendants repeat this same argument with regard to nearly every harm Plaintiffs \nidentify. Defendants cross-examined Plaintiffs’ witnesses on the fact that few had data \nshowing baselines from before the site was constructed or data showing developments \nsince the project came online. Of course, because Defendants did not consult with \nPlaintiffs or any other research group before constructing the project in eight days, there \nwas no opportunity to collect baseline data. And since Defendants have refused access \nto nearly everyone seeking to visit the site, Plaintiffs’ experts have been unable to take \nany samples or collect other data useful for empirical study. Further, the harms Plaintiffs \nfear  take  time  to  accrue;  and  time  and  access  for  study  is  precisely  what  NEPA \nprocedures are meant to afford. See Fund for Animals v. Rice, 85 F.3d 535, 546 (11th \nCir. 1996) (“NEPA ‘works’ by requiring that the environmental consequences of an action \nbe studied before the proposed action is taken.”).  \n32 This and other evidence of Defendants’ expansion plans undermines Defendants’ \nargument that “Plaintiffs point to harm that is too late to prevent[.]” (DE 16 at 16).  \nApp.178\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 71 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 208 of 226 \nendangered eastern black rail has been detected in the area around the site and that the \nTNT site is within the bonneted bat’s critical habitat zone.33 (DE 129 at 142). Both of these \nspecies are nocturnal, and the increased lighting from the project “will push” those \nanimals “out of the area. They do not use illuminated habitats.” (Id. at 132). Moreover, the \nincreased noise from additional construction and ongoing human activity on the site also \ndisrupts the bats’ “ability to [echolocate] prey.” (Id.)  \nAdditionally, the lighting from the site immediately reduces the panther habitat by \n2,000 acres, as studies suggest panthers are unlikely to come within 500 meters of a \nlarge artificial light source. (DE 114 at 232). Defendants dismiss this habitat loss as merely \na minuscule share of the total few 3.11 million acres of significant panther habitat. (Id. at \n262). But 2,000 acres is “hardly a de minimus injury” from one project to those hoping to \nsee panthers in the area and to preserve and maintain panthers’ habitats. Alliance for the \nWild Rockeies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011) (loss of 1,652 acres of \nforest caused sufficient irreparable harm to plaintiffs’ ability to enjoy the area undisturbed \nto warrant injunction, despite representing only 6% of the relevant area); see (DE 114 at \n158–60 (Amber Crooks testimony about her efforts to track panthers in the area); id. at \n229–34 (Kautz testifying that a 2,000-acre loss may well reduce the panther population \ndue to, among other impacts, inter-species aggression)). Further, vehicular strikes are \nthe number one cause of panther mortality, and stretches of the highway close to the TNT \nsite are known “hot spots” for panther strikes. (DE 114 at 161, 194; DE 38-6 at 24–25 \n(showing that 20 to 35 Florida panthers die per year from roadkills and documenting the \n33 Critical habit zones are a “formal designation that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife makes for \nsome listed species.” (DE 114 at 243). \nApp.179\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 72 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 209 of 226 \nmortality records near the site)).34 \nThe  ongoing  light  pollution  from  the  project  also  harms  Plaintiff  members’ \nenjoyment of the night sky—for which BCNP has received certification as an International \nDark Sky Park. See supra n.25; (DE 113 at 20–21 (describing what is required to maintain \na dark sky designation); DE 114 at 34 (discussing the impact the site will have on area’s \ndark sky designation); id. at 303 (describing the “pitch black darkness with beautiful [views \nof the] Milky Way and sky where you can see all of the stars”)). As the Court has \ndiscussed,  Plaintiffs  provide  empirical  data  proving  that  the  project  meaningfully \nincreases the brightness for miles around the site. See e.g., (Tribe Ex. 9 at 8–35). This \ndata factors in the prior existence of a few small, lit buildings on the jetport site.  \n  Finally, the Tribe provided testimony that Tribal members have lost access to the \noff-road trails leading into the BCNP lands for hunting and other activities due to the \ncamp’s operations. (DE 129 at 122–27, 133 164, 175). Furthermore, Tribal members had \npreviously harvested plants from the areas directly adjacent to the TNT site for ceremonial \nand  medicinal  purposes,  but  the  camp’s  new  human  activity  erodes  the  cultural \n34  Defendants  also  maintain  that  telemetry  data  acquired  by  tracking  a  sample  of \npanthers’ movements over time, suggest that panthers have not been seen within a few \nmiles of the site for many years. (Pl. Ex. 25 at 19, 26). In Defendants’ view, this proves \nthat no panther-related harm will be caused by the project, as the area was not in use by \nthe panther population even before the project’s construction. Defendants distort the \nsignificance of this data. Only some unknown fraction of the panther population was \naffixed with tracking collars, as researchers’ goal was “not to monitor every place within \nthe range of panthers that panthers occur.” (DE 114 at 279). Collection of data from the \nradio collars also ceased in 2014 due to budget cuts. (Id. at 275). And several of Plaintiffs’ \nwitnesses had either seen panthers in the area or knew others who had. See e.g., (DE \n129 at 143 (testifying to having captured recent panther presence in the area of the site \non trail cameras)). The fact that the data shows that panthers were detected within a four-\nmile radius of the TNT site 1,164 times in the few decades between 1982 and 2014 proves \nthat the area was a functioning panther habitat despite airport activity at the TNT site.

Cir. 2018) (reversing agency \nfinding of no irreparable harm where tribe challenged uranium mining project that risked \ndestruction of cultural, historical, and religious sites in the project area); Hualapai Indian \nTribe v. Haaland, 755 F. Supp. 3d 1165, 1197 (D. Az. 2024) (holding that plaintiff Indian \ntribe met the irreparable harm requirement “because it has shown that damage to . . . a \nculturally significant site for the [t]ribe[] is likely”).35 \nDefendants’ rejoinder to all this is that the TNT site was already in use as a training \nairport, and Plaintiffs have not proven that the detention camp creates harms above and \nbeyond those already wrought by the site’s prior use. Specifically, Defendants point to \nflight logs showing that over the seven months starting in January 2025, there were about \n28,000 “flight operations” from the site, or 137 per day. (DE 116-1 ¶ 11). In other words, \nover that period there were approximately 14,000 takeoffs and landings each. (Id. at 34). \n35 The Hualapai case is particularly instructive. The Hualapai tribe filed for a preliminary \ninjunction  to  enjoin  drilling  for  lithium  on  property  adjacent  to  a  sacred  hot  spring, \n“Ha’Kamwe’.” Hualapai, 755 F. Supp. 3d at 1173. The tribe alleged that BLM failed to \nconsider any reasonable alternative before approving the project; prematurely terminated \nits consultation process with the tribe; and failed to take a hard look at impacts in its EA \nby not analyzing geologic faults that could pollute the aquifers feeding Ha’Kamwe’. Id. at \n1186.  The  court  decided  an  injunction  was  appropriate,  finding  that  under  NEPA \n“[c]onsideration of reasonable alternatives is necessary to ensure that the agency has \nbefore it and takes into account all possible approaches to, and potential environmental \nimpacts of, a particular project.” Id. at 1192 (internal quotation omitted). As the court \nexplained, the defendants had failed to consider alternatives, such as approving fewer \ndrilling sites located farther away from Ha’Kamwe’. Id. at 1193. Finally, the court found \nthe tribe was likely to suffer irreparable harm if the drilling project went forward “through \nits impact to Ha’Kamwe’s character.” Id. at 1198–99 (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 22). The \ndecision in Hualapai supports the entry of a preliminary injunction in this case where no \nreasonable alternatives were considered, no environmental assessment of any kind was \nconducted and no consideration of any type of impact was undertaken. In sum, not only \ndid Defendants fail to take a “hard look” as required by NEPA, they failed to take any look.  \nApp.181\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 74 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 211 of 226 \nAlmost 80% of these were by single engine aircraft. (Id.) Defendants say these aircrafts \nsurely would have been sufficiently noisy to scare off animals and impede any recreation \nin  the  nearby  areas.  (DE  16  at  5–6).  Plaintiffs  present  their  own  flight  data  from  \n2020-2024, documenting around 11,600 flights total, or about 6 per day (not double-\ncounting takeoffs and landings). (Pl. Ex. 33).   \nThe Court need not parse which Party’s interpretation of the flight data presents a \nmore accurate picture of the site’s prior activity, because even Defendants’ version of the \ndata does not support the notion that the airport use caused similar harms as those posed \nby the detention camp. For one, several witnesses testified under oath that they worked \nor recreated in that area for years leading up to the camp’s construction and noticed little \nor no noise from the airport. E.g., (DE 114 at 176–77; DE 129 at 32, 87, 130). Defendants \ndiscount  these  individual  experiences  as  less  accurate  than  flight  data,  but  this \nmisconstrues the import of these eyewitnesses’ testimony. An irreparable harm inquiry is \nfocused on how an event, in this case noise, impacts the effected individuals. Beyond \nthis, many harms separate from noise undisputably were created or are exacerbated by \nthe  detention  camp.  The  light  pollution  is  far  worse  now  than  before  the  camp’s \nconstruction. (Tribe Ex. 9). The addition of 800,000 square feet of asphalt paving (with \nanother 1 million planned) increases harmful water runoff relative to the areas previously \npaved. (Pl. Exs. 22, 90–92, 126 at 1). The frenetic human activity, including vehicular \ntraffic and wastewater from thousands of people daily, was essentially absent prior to the \ndetention camp’s construction. See (DE 113 at 27 (Dr. McVoy recounting a statement by \nthe TNT site’s Incident Commander Dr. Frank E. Lumm that prior to the detention center \nthe airport had “four employees, most of whom were involved in mowing the grass”)). In \nApp.182\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 75 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 212 of 226 \nshort, Plaintiffs have provided substantial evidence to prove that irreparable harm from \nthe detention camp is ongoing and likely to worsen absent injunctive relief. The Court will \nnext  consider  the  balance  between  these  harms  and  the  Government’s  interest  in \ncontinuing detention operations at this site before conducting the required NEPA analysis.  \n3.  Balance of equities and public interest \nFor similar reasons, the balance of equities and the public interest favor granting \na preliminary injunction. “These two factors merge when, as here, the government is the \nopposing party.” Farmworker Ass’n of Fla. v. Moody, 734 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1342 (S.D. \nFla.  2024)  (internal  quotations omitted).  The  Court has  discussed  the  ongoing  and \npossible  future  irreparable  harms  caused  by  Defendants’  NEPA  violation.  When \nirreparable environmental harms are sufficiently likely, “the balance of harms will usually \nfavor the issuance of an injunction to protect the environment.” Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. \nat  545.  The  Court  acknowledges  Defendants’  unchallenged  position  that  the \ngovernment’s interest in immigration enforcement is significant. Immigration is at the \nforefront  of  national  and  state  politics:  as  the  swell  of  people  seeking  refuge  and \nopportunities in our nation steadily increases, the government is under a corresponding \npressure to respond and regulate. \nThe Federal Defendants argue that “the significant national interest in combatting \nunlawful immigration favors allowing Florida to continue the development and use of [the \ndetention camp].” (DE 21 at 7). To this end, the Federal Defendants rely on Thomas Giles’ \ndeclaration that the detention camp’s function in detaining aliens “operationally benefits \nICE and furthers its immigration enforcement mission.” Id. Giles goes on to state that the \ndetention camp serves to “decompress other detention facilities used to house aliens \nApp.183\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 76 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 213 of 226 \nthroughout the United States.” (DE 21-1 at 5).  \nThis position, however, flounders when confronted with the weight of evidence as \nto the irreparable harm posed by Defendants’ flouting NEPA protocols. Plaintiffs have \nprovided extensive evidence supporting their claims of significant ongoing and likely \nfuture environmental harms from the project. See supra Section III.C.2. By contrast, while \nthe Defendants repeatedly espouse the importance of immigration enforcement, they \noffered little to no evidence why this detention camp, in this particular location, is uniquely \nsuited and critical to that mission. Director Kerner did state that his troopers “have \nencountered and apprehended people that have active warrants for murder in other \ncountries” and offered his belief that some of those individuals might be detained at the \ndetention camp. (DE 129 at 202). Director Kerner could not, however, offer any statistics \nor reports specifying how many individuals actually housed at the facility had such a \ncriminal background. (Id. at 206). He could not directly testify that even one of the \ndetainees had a criminal record, much less a record of violent crimes necessitating their \nseclusion from society in the Everglades. (Id. at 206, 219).  \nDirector Kerner further asserted that the detention camp is necessary because \nother immigration facilities are at capacity. (Id. at 205). This need, however, again fails to \nexplicate the decision to place the detention camp in the Everglades.36 Counsel for the \n36 Any detention capacity issue also appears will be mitigated by the State’s recent \nannouncement  of  a  second  temporary  immigration detention facility  with  “the  same \nservices as Alligator Alcatraz” also with costs to be “reimbursed by federal partners.” \nPress Release, Executive Office of the Governor, Governor Ron Desantis Announces \nExpansion of Florida’s Capacity to Detain and Deport Illegal Aliens (Aug. 14, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/3HXE-73VY. See Santa Clara, 250 F. Supp. 3d at 520 nn.4, 6–7 (taking \nnotice of government officials’ statements during press conferences and interviews); \nMcLoughlin, 586 F.

Ins. \nApp.184\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 77 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 214 of 226 \nFederal Defendants opined that the detention camp housed “all sorts of people from all \nwalks of life” and claimed that the camp’s remoteness is “relevant to the national security \nand public safety interest at play here.” (DE 130 at 68, 77-78). When pressed by this \nCourt, however, the Federal Defendants conceded that they actually had no opinion on \nthe efficacy of the detention camp’s location, saying that the location “is a question for \nFlorida to decide.” (Id. at 69). The Federal Defendants further conceded that there was \nno issue with the operation of other ICE detention facilities in populated areas like \nJacksonville and Boca Raton. (Id. at 78). Thus, at least for the Federal Defendants, the \nremoteness of the detention camp seems to be an inconsequential consideration.  \nThe State Defendants also insisted that the detention camp’s remoteness was an \nimportant consideration. The State presented testimony from Director Kerner that the \ndetention  camp’s  site  was  “ideal”  because  “first  and  foremost,”  it  is  “far  removed.”  \n(DE 129 at 225). Director Kerner also pointed to the site’s “very long runway[,] which is a \nvery critical piece of the deportation process.” (Id.) But aside from their use of adjectives, \nneither the State nor Director Kerner could explain why such a place needs to be in the \nEverglades. What is apparent, however, is that in their haste to construct the detention \ncamp, the State did not consider alternative locations. Indeed, Director Kerner testified \nthat the current detention camp is the “only site that [he] looked at.” (Id. at 223).  \nAllowing  the  detention  camp  to  continue  expanding  its  infrastructure  and \noperations poses an even more formidable challenge than maintaining the status quo \nbecause “it is difficult to change that course” if the Court eventually decides that NEPA \nCo., 309 F. Supp. 3d 1216, 1220 n.4 (S.D. Fla. 2018). (“The Court may take judicial notice \nof government publications and website materials.”). \nApp.185\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 78 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 215 of 226 \nassessments are required. Sierra Club v. Marsh, 872 F.2d 497, 500, 505 (1st Cir. 1989) \n(vacating  district  court’s  denial  of  preliminary  injunction  related  to  NEPA  claim  and \nremanding). Defendants brush aside this concern by pointing to Justice Kavanaugh’s \nremark  in  Seven  County  that  “NEPA  has  transformed  from  a  modest  procedural \nrequirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents.” 145 S. Ct. \nat 1513. But while the Seven County case cited by counsel for the State is instructive, it \nis  not for  the phrases  parsed  by  counsel.  While  the  Court  did  discuss how  NEPA \nrequisites could sometimes be an impediment to critical projects, the comment was made \nin the context of that particular case: a 3,600-page EIS generated over a year-long period \nwith the input of six public meetings and more than 1,900 public comments. Id. at 1508. \nThis is hardly a meaningful guide in a matter where there was no consultation with the \npublic and no reports of any page length regarding a project that was erected in eight \ndays. Instead, this case exemplifies why NEPA’s modest mandate that an “agency [take] \na ‘hard look’ at the environmental consequences of [a] proposed action” before saddling \ncommunities and future generations with unknown environmental risks is still an important \nprocedural check. Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 295 F.3d 1209, 1216  \n(11th Cir. 2002); Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989) \n(“Simply by focusing the agency’s attention on the environmental consequences of a \nproposed  project,  NEPA  ensures  that  important  effects  will  not  be  overlooked  or \nunderestimated only to be discovered after resources have been committed or the die \notherwise cast.”). In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the equities weigh in favor \nof granting a preliminary injunction.  \nNonetheless,  the  Court  recognizes  the  unique  and  unprecedented  situation \nApp.186\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 79 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 216 of 226 \npresented by this case. The Court fully understands the interests of the Defendants and \nthe importance of a well-ordered transition while Defendants modify the facility to perform \nthe necessary environmental assessments. The construction of the facility may have \ntaken only eight days, but the capacity of the Defendants to remedy the NEPA violations \noutlined will involve a longer period of time. The Court has endeavored to provide that \ntemporal accommodation in its Order. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn 1947, President Harry Truman dedicated Everglades National Park observing: \nNot often in these demanding days are we able to lay aside the problems of the \ntime, and turn to a project whose great value lies in the enrichment of the human \nspirit. Today we make the achievement of another great conservation victory. We \nhave  permanently  safeguarded  an  irreplaceable  primitive  area.  We  have \nassembled to dedicate to the use of all people for all time, the Everglades National \nPark.37 \n \nTwenty years later, a proposal for construction of the world’s largest jetport—at the \nsite discussed in this case—was abandoned, and the Big Cypress National Preserve was \ncreated to protect this area.38 Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida \nsenator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have \npublicly  pledged  their  unequivocal  support  for  the  restoration,  conservation,  and \nprotection of the Everglades. This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic \nrequirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises. \n \n37 Harry S.

For the purposes of Defendants becoming compliant with their obligations under \nNEPA, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Plaintiffs’ Motion for \na Preliminary Injunction (DE 5), as follows:  \n2.  The Court ENTERS a Preliminary Injunction prohibiting the State and Federal \nDefendants39 and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person \nwho is in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional \nindustrial-style lighting (described by witnesses as “Sunbelt” lighting); or doing any \npaving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including \nplacing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential \nor administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons \nonto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time of \nthis  Order  going  into  effect.  The  Preliminary  Injunction  does  not  prohibit \nmodification or repairs to existing facilities, which are solely for the purpose of \nincreasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site.  \n3.  The Preliminary Injunction shall include among those “who are in active concert or \nparticipation  with”  the  State  or  Federal  Defendants  or  their  officers,  agents, \nemployees,  or  attorneys,  and  thus  prohibited  from  conducting  the  activities \nspecified  above,  any  contractors,  subcontractors,  or  any  other  individuals  or \n39 Though state agencies are not subject to the APA, when “state and federal [actions] \nare sufficiently interrelated,” the Court may enjoin state entities from acting in violation of \nNEPA.

P. 65(d)(2)(C) (including \n“other persons who are in active concert or participation with” the parties or the \nparties’ officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys among those bound \nby any injunction). \n4.  No later than sixty (60) days from the date of this order, and once the population \nattrition  allows  for  safe  implementation  of  this  Order,40  the  Defendants  shall \nremove 1) the temporary fencing installed by Defendants to allow Tribe members \naccess to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the erection of \nthe detention camp; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting \ninstalled for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, \ngas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed to support \nthis project.  \n5.  Finally, Plaintiffs shall post a bond of $100. See BellSouth Telecomm., Inc. v. \nMCImetro Access Transmission Servs., LLC, 425 F.3d 964, 971 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(internal citations omitted) (“the amount of security required by the rule is a matter \nwithin the discretion of the trial court”). \n40  Based  on  Defendants’  representation  that  the  site  is  currently  being  used  as  a \ntransportation spoke to other facilities, the Court is relying on programmatic attrition of the \ncamp’s population within the next sixty days. See C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), \nECF 50-1 ¶¶ 10 (stating that the detention facility on the TNT site “provides short-term \nhousing while longer term housing or removal arrangements are secured for aliens”). This \nattrition will allow Defendants time to remove the newly installed fencing, lighting, and \nother fixtures and utilities apparatus in a safe, humane, and responsible manner. The \nhousing and detention dormitory facilities may remain and be maintained to prevent \ndeterioration or damage. \nApp.189\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 82 of 82\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 219 of 226 \nDONE AND ORDERED in Chambers in Miami, Florida, on this 21st day of August, \n2025. \n \nApp.190\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 136   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2025   Page 1 of 2\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 220 of 226 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nNo. 25-cv-22896-JEM \n \nFRIENDS OF THE EVERGLADES, INC., et al.       \n         \n  Plaintiffs, \n \nand \n \nMICCOSUKEE TRIBE OF INDIANS OF FLORIDA, \n \n            Plaintiff-Intervenor, \n \nv. \n \nKRISTI NOEM, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n_______________________________________ \n \nFEDERAL DEFENDANTS’ NOTICE OF INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL \n  Federal Defendants Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, in their official capacities, hereby give \nnotice that they appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit from the Order issued in this case on August 21, 2025, Dkt. 131.

I am the Field Office Director (FOD) for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS),\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) \nMiami field office (ERO Miami). I have been the FOD of ERO Miami since September of 2022.  \nApp.193\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 138-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2025   Page 3 of 6\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 223 of 226 \n2. As the FOD, I am responsible for managing ERO Miami, encompassing a total of 652\nauthorized  positions,  16  sub-offices,  and  four  detention  facilities.    ERO  Miami’s  area  of \nresponsibility (AOR) covers enforcement operations throughout the State of Florida, Puerto \nRico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as the Migrant Operations Center in Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba. \n3. I began my federal career in 1996 with legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\nas a Detention Enforcement Officer in Miami, Florida.  I was promoted to a Deportation Officer \n(DO) in 2002, and after the formation of DHS and ICE in March 2003, I rose through the ranks of \nERO with promotions to Supervisory Detention and Deportation Officer (SDDO), Assistant FOD \n(AFOD), Deputy FOD (DFOD), and FOD of ERO Miami.  In 2022, I became a member of the \nSenior Executive Service as FOD for ERO Miami.  In January 2025, I held the position of Acting \nAssistant Director for ICE Field Operations.  From February 2025 through May 2025, I served as \nthe  Acting  Deputy  Executive  Associate  Director for  ICE  ERO.    Responsible  for  a  budget  of \napproximately $5.1 billion dollars, I directed the operations of more than 7,800 employees assigned \nto 25 ERO field offices and headquarters, in over 180 domestic locations and 30 overseas locations. \nIn June 2025, I resumed my role as FOD for ERO Miami.  \n4. I am familiar with the allegations made by Plaintiffs in the instant lawsuit regarding the\nSouth Florida Soft-Sided Facility South (SFSSFS) Detention Center.  Additionally, I am familiar \nwith immigration enforcement activities and programs nationwide, including detention facility \ncapacities and their operational impacts.  \n5. I provide this declaration based on my personal knowledge, reasonable inquiry, and\ninformation obtained from various records and other DHS and ICE employees in the regular \ncourse of business. \nApp.194\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 138-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2025   Page 4 of 6\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 224 of 226 \nOperational Impact of the Closure of the SFSSFS Detention Center \n6.  Although only one of ERO’s 25 AORs, ERO Miami consistently accounts for 10-15 \npercent of all ICE arrests nationwide. \n7.  ERO  Miami  oversees  one  of  the  largest  non-detained  ICE  dockets  in  the  nation, \nmanaging  approximately  1.5  million  active  cases  involving  aliens  in  various  stages  of  the \nimmigration process. \n8.  ICE  ERO,  specifically  ERO  Miami  also  maintains  a  network  of  detention  beds \nthroughout its AOR, through a mixture of ICE-owned, privately owned, and state and local \nfacilities.   \n9.  Since January 2025, all detention facilities under ERO Miami have been operating at or \nabove their maximum capacity. \n10.  ERO  Miami  strives  to  maintain  sufficient  bedspace  to  support  its  law  enforcement \noperations, including the arrests of aliens with criminal histories (criminal aliens) from prisons \nand jails, as well as aliens at-large who pose threats to national security and public safety within \nthe United States.  Additionally, ERO Miami accommodates fluctuating referrals from U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection.  What sets ERO Miami apart from other ERO field offices is its \ndual responsibility of managing interior arrests while also addressing the unpredictable nature of \nmaritime ventures, which can result in hundreds of arrests at a time. \n11.  The  expanded  detention  capacity  Florida  created  with  SFSSFS  Detention  Center  is \nessential for ERO Miami’s operations, as it permits ERO Miami to keep pace with increased and \noften unpredictable detention needs. Its removal would compromise the government's ability to \nenforce immigration laws, safeguard public safety, protect national security, and maintain border \nsecurity. \n12.  Without access to the 2,000 detention beds at the SFSSFS Detention Center, ERO Miami \n \nApp.195\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 138-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2025   Page 5 of 6\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 225 of 226 \nwould lose the ability to detain criminal aliens (to include aliens with violent criminal records), \nas all of the aforementioned ERO Miami facilities are at or above capacity.  The SFSSFS \nDetention Center is a critical component necessary to prevent operational failure and potentially \navert a national crisis.  \n13.  A  disruption  in  the  use  or  suspension  of  the  SFSSFS  Detention  Center  would  also \nseverely  impact  coordination  with  State,  County,  and  Federal  partners,  who  hold  Title  8 \n(immigration enforcement) authority and maintain daily immigration arrest rates comparable to \nERO Miami.  Without sufficient bedspace, these partners would ostensibly lose the ability to \ncarry  out  arrests,  significantly  affecting  the  various  task  forces  focusing  on  apprehending \ncriminal  aliens,  gang  members,  wanted  fugitive felons,  and  individuals  with  prior  criminal \nremovals.  This would pose a substantial risk to community safety. \n14.  The United States, including ERO Miami, is legally required to detain certain aliens.  \nEliminating the use of the SFSSFS Detention Center would result in delays or the inability to \npursue  arrests  of  criminal  aliens  solely  due  to  insufficient  bedspace.    This  would  severely \nundermine the consistent enforcement of immigration laws.  \n15.  The SFSSFS Detention Center is thus a vital tool for maintaining a lawful immigration \nprocess and detention environment.  Before its establishment, ERO Miami faced significant \novercrowding in its detention facilities, which placed the government in a challenging position to \nensure compliance with ICE detention standards.  The SFSSFS Detention Center has effectively \nalleviated these issues. \n16.  The cornerstone of ICE’s enforcement mission is the promotion of public safety through \nthe removal of criminal aliens from the United States. The ability to detain criminal aliens \nensures ICE’s ability to eventually effectuate their removal from our communities. Continued \nstrain on detention capacity greatly increases the possibility that criminal aliens, a priority target \n \nApp.196\n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 138-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2025   Page 6 of 6\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 20     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 226 of 226 \nfor immigration enforcement, will remain at large and able to continue committing crimes. \nAliens detained at the SFSSFS Detention Center included those with serious crimes to include \nrobbery with a deadly weapon, sexual battery, and lewd and lascivious molestation of a child. \n17.  The SFSSFS Detention Center has been instrumental in supporting the government's \nrobust immigration enforcement efforts by enabling the detention of criminal aliens.  Without \nthis facility and its detention capacity, many of these individuals would either be released back \ninto the community or not arrested at all, placing significant strain on local communities.  The \ninability to detain criminal aliens due solely to a lack of detention space creates a serious public \nsafety risk. Notably, it is estimated that among the millions of aliens who entered the United \nStates under the previous administration, one in four provided a release address in the State of \nFlorida. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \nSigned this 23rd day of August, 2025 \n \n  GARRETT Digitally signed by GARRETT J RIPA\nDN: cn=GARRETT J RIPA, o=U.S.\nGovernment, ou=People,\n____J_ R__IP_A_____ecD_=maUtaeS_i:l= 2G0a2_r5r-e0t_8t.-J2.R3_Tip1a7@_:1i0c:e3_.3d-h0s4_.g0o0v_, _________ \n      Garrett Ripa \nField Office Director \nEnforcement and Removal Operations \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n \nApp.197",

United States, 567 U.S. 387, 436 (2012) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting in part).  That is true for Florida, which declared a state of \nemergency due to the harms associated with the recent influx of illegal \naliens.  As part of its emergency response, the State converted a busy \nairport  in  Collier  County  (in  the  Middle  District  of  Florida)  into  a \ntemporary,  one-stop  detention  and  deportation  facility,  known  as \nAlligator Alcatraz.  The State controls the land on which the detention \nfacility  sits.    The  State  funded  its  construction  (though  federal \nreimbursement is possible).  The State accepts immigration detainees \npursuant  to  287(g)  agreements  with  the  federal  government,  but  it \nexercises discretion over whether to accept any detainee.  Thus, although \nthe  detention  facility  is  used  for  immigration  functions—like  many \nfacilities across Florida, including county jails—it remains a State facility \nunder State control.   \nSince  early  July,  the  detention  facility  had  been  operational, \nhousing thousands of detainees and alleviating overcrowding elsewhere.  \nThat is, until August 21, when a district court in the Southern District of \n1 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 6 of 52 \n \nFlorida preliminarily enjoined any additional detention or construction \nat the facility and required its closure within sixty days.  The court based \nits  injunction  on  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)—a \nfederal procedural statute that, through the APA, reaches only federal \nagency decisionmaking.  The court entered this sweeping injunction even \nthough (1) it lacked venue over this Middle District-based facility (as both \nJudges Altman and Ruiz recognized in other lawsuits); (2) NEPA does \nnot reach State decisionmaking; (3) the court has no jurisdiction to enjoin \nfederal  immigration  detention;  and  (4)  the  balance  of  harms  tips \ndecidedly  against  preliminary  relief.    This  sweeping  and  unlawful \ninjunction  promises  immediate  disruption  of  critical  law-enforcement \nactivity, imposes significant financial and logistical burdens on the State, \nand undermines public safety.   \nTwo decades ago, in a NEPA case, the Supreme Court counseled \nthat a preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy that may only \nbe awarded upon a clear showing” that the plaintiff is “likely to succeed \non  the  merits”  and  “irreparable  injury  is  likely  in  the  absence  of  an \ninjunction.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 22 \n(2008)  (emphasis  added).    Here,  Plaintiffs  failed  to  make  a  “clear \n2 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 7 of 52 \n \nshowing”  that  merits  success  and  immediate  “irreparable”  harm  are \n“likely.”    Indeed,  beyond  the  glaring  venue  defect,  Plaintiffs  cannot \nsucceed on the merits because the funding and construction of the facility \nwere State actions that NEPA does not reach, and federal immigration \ndetention cannot be enjoined under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(e) and 1252(f) and \nthe  APA  itself.    Moreover,  Plaintiffs  only  speculated  about  potential \nenvironmental  harm  years  from now, not  immediate  and  irreparable \nissues.  Meanwhile, the harm to the State and federal governments is \nserious and imminent.  The district court ignored these defects to exert \nexpansive judicial control over a significant law-enforcement initiative. \nIn so doing, the district court ignored not only Winter but also the \nSupreme Court’s recent warning about eschewing “the limits on judicial \nauthority.”  Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2561 (2025).  The \nproceedings below have the hallmarks of such overreach.  The venue \nissue was fully briefed on July 29.  Rather than decide that threshold \nquestion of judicial power at the outset, the court deferred the question, \nentered a TRO on August 7, and held a four-day preliminary-injunction \nhearing.  At that hearing, the district court repeatedly issued one-sided \nevidentiary rulings and invoked other cases, news stories, and social-\n3 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 8 of 52 \n \nmedia posts not in evidence.  See infra pp. 11-13 (documenting examples).  \nIn its order, the district court strayed well beyond arguments and facts \npresented  by  Plaintiffs,  presumably  because  Plaintiffs’  presentation \nalone was insufficient to support the injunction.  \nThis Court should grant an administrative stay pending its decision \non  this  motion,  stay  the  preliminary  injunction,  and  stay  further \nproceedings in the district court until this appeal concludes. \nBACKGROUND \n1.  Rampant illegal immigration has created a national emergency.1  \nDue to a federal non-enforcement policy beginning in 2021, over two \nmillion illegal aliens flooded through the southern border each year until \nearly  2025.2    That  rush  inundated  Florida  with  “dangerous  criminal \naliens,” Fed.

FDEM Ex.60 \nat 11-20.  The Governor authorized the Florida Division of Emergency \nManagement (FDEM) to coordinate State and local agencies to abate the \nemergency.  Id.  That is not unusual:  FDEM is the statewide emergency-\nresponse  agency  and  routinely  coordinates  with  law  enforcement  to \nrespond to emergencies.  See Fla. Stat. § 252.35. \n2.    One  key  challenge  in  combatting  the  harms  from  illegal \nimmigration is insufficient detention capacity.  Vol. IV 195:12-15, 195:20-\n22; FDEM Ex.30 ¶11; see also Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 519 (2003) \n(“[O]ne  of  the  major  causes  of  the  INS’  failure  to  remove  deportable \ncriminal aliens was the agency’s failure to detain those aliens during \ntheir deportation proceedings.”).  To address that problem, Florida built \na  State-run  detention  facility  at  the  Dade-Collier  Training  and \nTransition Airport (TNT).  FDEM Ex.60 ¶20; Fed. Ex.7 ¶17; FDEM Ex.30 \n¶11. \n \n3  Transcripts  are  cited  by  volume:  August  6  (Vol.  I);  August  7 \n(morning) (Vol. II); August 7 (afternoon) (Vol. III); August 12 (Vol. IV); \nand August 13 (Vol. V). \n5 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 10 of 52 \n \nBefore its conversion into a temporary detention facility, TNT was \nan active airport used for hundreds of training flights each week.

Id. ¶¶8, 16.  \nBefore  its  conversion,  TNT  was  a  busy  airport  that  “routinely \nhost[ed] over 150 aviation operations each day.”  FDEM Ex.62 ¶¶2-3.  \nFrom  January  1  through  July  23,  2025,  nearly  28,000  takeoffs  and \nlandings,  involving  aircraft  of  all  sizes—including  jets  and  military \nhelicopters—occurred at TNT.  FDEM Ex.60 ¶¶11-12 & pp.34-36; FDEM \nEx.63 ¶2.  \nOn  June  23,  2025,  FDEM  exercised  its  State-law  authority  to \ncommandeer the TNT airport to build a temporary detention facility.  \nFDEM Ex.60 at 22.  The red shading below reflects the commandeered \narea: \n7 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 12 of 52 \n \n \nId. ¶9, p.32.  Roughly 98% of the commandeered area lies in Collier \nCounty, including all the detention facility’s buildings, improvements, \nand operations.  Id. \nThe detention facility “was entirely State constructed.”  Id. ¶21; \nFed. Ex.7 ¶19; Pls.’ Ex.4 ¶2.  FDEM oversaw its development, and it was \nbuilt by State vendors, paid with State dollars.

Id.  To date, the State has no legally enforceable \nright to reimbursement from the federal government for funds spent on \n8 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 13 of 52 \n \nthe facility, and the federal government has not, in fact, reimbursed \nFDEM.  Id. ¶22; Pls.’ Ex.4 ¶3; FDEM Ex.44 ¶4. \nFDEM has been careful to protect the environment in constructing \nand operating the detention facility.  It “paved exclusively over land that \nwas  previously  filled  and  leveled”  as  part  of  the  original  airport \ndevelopment; erected protective “silt fencing” to “block sediment runoff”; \ninstituted a “rigorous waste-management policy”; and commissioned a \nwildlife study that identified no “meaningful impacts” on native species.  \nFDEM  Ex.60  ¶¶18-19.    FDEM  also  ensured  that  all  the  facility’s \ninfrastructure was temporary and removable.  Id. ¶17. \nFDEM  coordinates  management  of  the  facility  with  State  law-\nenforcement agencies that have agreements with the federal government \nunder section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1357(g).  Id. ¶23.  About four ICE officers are on-site to provide guidance \nand handle detainee transportation.  Id. ¶24; Fed. Ex.7 ¶19.  But those \nofficers “do not control the site.”  FDEM Ex.60 ¶24.  Rather, State officials \n“operate[] th[e] facility,” id. ¶25, and exercise “complete discretion in \ndeciding” whether to accept detainees, Fed. Ex.7 ¶18. \n9 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 14 of 52 \n \n3.  On June 27, 2025, two advocacy groups sued FDEM and the \nfederal  government,  alleging  that  they  violated  NEPA  by  failing  to \nprepare an environmental-impact statement (EIS) before constructing \nthe facility.  Doc. 1 ¶¶61-74.4  Plaintiffs sought a TRO and preliminary \ninjunction barring Defendants from constructing the facility or using it \nfor immigration detention.  Doc. 5 at 13-14.  After Judge Martinez’s \nrecusal, the case was reassigned to Judge Williams.  Doc. 37.  The court \npermitted  the  Miccosukee  Tribe  to  intervene  over  FDEM’s  objection.  \nDocs. 33, 58, 73. \nResponding  to  Plaintiffs’  injunction  request,  Defendants  argued \nNEPA does not apply to the State-built and -operated detention facility \nbecause that statute governs only federal actions.  Docs. 16, 21.  After \nthat response, Plaintiffs supplemented their motion several times, Docs. \n25-27, 34, 38, 47, 49, and twice renewed their requests for injunctive \nrelief, Docs. 31, 40.  Replying to one of those supplements—and before \nthe  district  court  conducted  any  substantive  hearing—Defendants \nasserted that venue was improper in the Southern District because the \n \n4 Plaintiffs sued Miami-Dade County but did not seek preliminary \nrelief against it. \n10 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 15 of 52 \n \nfacility  lies  in  the  Middle  District  and  no  relevant  decisionmaking \noccurred in the Southern District.

Plaintiffs then disclosed thirteen witnesses and hundreds of \nexhibits, such that the hearing extended into a four-day affair, almost all \nof  which  was  used  by  Plaintiffs  to  speculate  about  potential \nenvironmental harm far in the future.  Docs. 102-03, 119, 121.  Midway \nthrough  that  hearing,  and  before  Defendants  presented  their  case, \nPlaintiffs again moved for a TRO, which the court granted.  The TRO \nbarred  Defendants  from  “installing  any  additional  industrial-style \nlighting … or doing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing \nany other site expansion, including placing or erecting any additional \nbuildings,  tents,  dormitories,  or  other  residential  or  administrative \nfacilities on the TNT site.”  Doc. 104 at 12.   \nDuring the evidentiary hearing, the court:  \n•  permitted  Plaintiffs  to  introduce  voluminous  hearsay \nevidence through live witnesses (Vol I 324:2-23 (permitting \nwitness to report what a receptionist on the citizen’s line at \nthe Governor’s Office said in response to a question about the \ndetention facility); see also Vol. I 96:9-15, 101:4-19, 324:18-20; \nVol. II 27:4-6, 27:14-15; Vol. IV 13:22-14:1, 232:13-24), while \n11 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 16 of 52 \n \nbarring  defendants  from  doing  the  same  (Vol.  IV  199:5-9 \n(disallowing  Executive  Director  of  Florida  Highway  Patrol \nfrom testifying about actions of his officers)); \n•  interposed its policy views on immigration (Vol. IV 194:18-21 \n(“[T]here is a housing issue because nobody is being given \nbond  under  the  INA.”));  Vol.  V  68:17-21  (opining  that \nimmigration  detainees  are  “carpenters  and  agricultural \nworkers”);  \n•  overruled nearly all Defendants’ objections (Vol. I 29:9-20, \n85:1-19, 88:7-24, 96:9-15, 101:4-19; Vol. II 68:23-69:3, 75:4-10; \nVol.  IV  33:5-7,  38:12-19,  48:17-22,  50:3-7,  117:22-118:4, \n130:17-25,  146:18-21,  172:13-14,  219:12-15,  223:15-19; \n232:13-24),  \n•  but  sustained  most  of  Plaintiffs’  (Vol.  I  42:8-44:12;  65:21-\n69:11,  73:1-74:3,  75:2-21,  118:21-119:13,  182:9-10,  253:12-\n254:23, 324:15-23; Vol. IV 190:23-191:3, 191:22-23, 192:4-8, \n199:5-9); \n•  interposed its own objections and “sustained” objections that \nPlaintiffs  did  not  make  (Vol.  I  65:1-5,  72:18-24,  75:9-21, \n120:14-21, 177:18-24); \n•  prohibited Defendants’ attempt to cross-examine witnesses \nwith  impeachment  exhibits  if  they  were  not  already  in \nevidence (Vol. I 42:8-44:12; 65:21-69:11, 73:1-74:3);  \n•  sharply curtailed Defendants’ attempt to introduce evidence \non how the immigration crisis harmed Florida (Vol. IV 190:4-\n191:3, 191:11-23, 191:25-193:19, 199:5-200:4, 200:6-202:10);  \n•  permitted  Plaintiffs’  lay  witnesses  to  offer  expert \nenvironmental-impact testimony (Vol. I 156:3-25);  \n•  allowed Plaintiffs’ experts to opine on scientific matters not \nraised in their expert reports (Vol. II 14:25-15:14, 22:12-18); \n12 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 17 of 52 \n \n•  let Plaintiffs submit an untimely hydrology expert report (Vol. \nI 13:1-12; Vol. II 68:22-69:8); and  \n•  repeatedly  referenced  facts  outside  the  record,  including \n“litigation in Illinois” (Vol. III 48:12-17); an email from an ICE \nrepresentative from a different case (Vol. V 63:8-13); and an \ninterview from Florida’s Attorney General that the court sua \nsponte  raised  after  evidence  had  closed  as  a  formal \n“invitation” to visit the facility (Vol. IV 244:2-246:2).  \nThe  parties  delivered  extensive  closings.    See  generally  Vol.  V.  \nDefendants also requested that the court stay any preliminary injunction \npending appeal. \nAt 8:47 p.m. on August 21—the last day of the TRO period—the \ncourt  entered  a  preliminary  injunction  requiring  Defendants  to \n(i) immediately  cease  bringing  new  detainees  to  the  facility, \n(ii) immediately cease new construction, and (iii) remove all new lighting, \nfencing,  and  utilities  within  sixty  days—effectively  shuttering  the \nfacility.  Doc. 131 80-81.  The court did not rule on the stay request, so on \nAugust 23 FDEM and the federal government renewed that motion with \ndeclarations  explaining  the  immediate  and  irreparable  harm  the \ninjunction will impose.  Docs. 137, 138.  Defendants requested a ruling \nby 5 p.m. on August 25.  Because the district court did not rule by August \n25, and because waiting additional time would be impracticable given the \n13 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 18 of 52 \n \nimmediate harm the district court’s injunction is causing, FDEM now \nseeks a stay from this Court.  See Fed. R. App. P. 8.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  DEFENDANTS  ARE  LIKELY  TO  SUCCEED  IN  OVERTURNING  THE \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nA “preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy \nnot to be granted unless the movant clearly established the burden of \npersuasion as to each of the four prerequisites.”  Siegel v. Lepore, 234 \nF.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000).  Here, Plaintiffs did not come close to \njustifying this extraordinary and drastic interruption of the government’s \nresponse to a State and federal law-enforcement emergency. \nA.  The Southern District of Florida Is an Improper Venue \nUnder  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b),  venue  is  proper  only  in  “a  judicial \ndistrict in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise \nto the claim occurred.”  The “relevant … acts and omissions” in that \nanalysis are those with “a close nexus to the wrong” alleged.  Jenkins \nBrick Co. v. Bremer, 321 F.3d 1366, 1372 (11th Cir. 2003). \nThe wrong alleged here, as the district court recognized, is that \nDefendants violated NEPA by building the detention facility without \nconducting an EIS.  Doc. 131 at 50-51.  That targeted claim has an equally \n14 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 19 of 52 \n \ntargeted universe of relevant acts or omissions.  See Friends of Earth v. \nHaaland, 2022 WL 185196, at *2-5 (D.D.C. Jan. 20, 2022).  The relevant \nacts are the facility’s construction, operation, and decisionmaking related \nto those acts.  Id. at *3 (“In cases brought under the APA, courts generally \nfocus on where the decisionmaking process occurred to determine where \nthe claims arose.”); Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA, 675 F. Supp. 2d \n173, 179 (D.D.C. 2009) (collecting cases).  And the “relevant omission [i]s \nthe lack of a decision to conduct” an EIS.  Friends of Earth, 2022 WL \n185196, at *4. \nNone  of  that  occurred  in  the  Southern  District.    All  decisions \ngoverning the facility’s construction and lack of an EIS were made by \ngovernment leaders in Tallahassee (or on Plaintiffs’ theory, Washington, \nD.C.).    FDEM  Ex.31  ¶4.5    All  the  detention  facility’s  operations  and \ninfrastructure  lie  in  Collier  County,  which  is  in  the  Middle  District.  \nGarcia v. Guthrie, No. 25-cv-23136 (S.D. Fla. July 16, 2025), Doc. 5 at 1.  \nAnd all decisions related to those operations are made on-site in Collier \n \n5 The district court labeled this evidence “conclusory.”  Doc. 131 at \n40.  But it was grounded in an FDEM supervisor’s extensive knowledge.  \nFDEM Ex.60 ¶2.  And besides, Plaintiffs must establish venue.  See \nDelong Equip. Co. v. Wash. Mills Abrasive Co., 840 F.2d 843, 845 (11th \nCir. 1988).  So, any ambiguity only hinders Plaintiffs’ venue claim. \n15 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 20 of 52 \n \nor by FDEM leadership in Tallahassee.  FDEM Exs. 31 ¶4, 60 ¶10.  For \nthat reason, two Judges in the Southern District have held that it is an \nimproper venue for facility-related claims.  See C.M. v. Noem, 2025 WL \n2400953, at *20-23 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 18, 2025); Garcia, Doc. 5 at 1.   \nTo nonetheless find venue, and create an untenable intra-district \nsplit, the district court erred multiple times over. \n1.    The  court  concluded  that  raising  venue  in  a  supplemental \nresponse to a TRO motion, and before any adjudication, “is sufficient for \na finding of waiver” and “to foreclose venue as an issue” under Rule 12.  \nDoc. 131 at 22-24.  The court, however, appears not to have relied on this \nfinding  because  “the  Court  addresse[d]  the  merits  of  all  Defendants’ \nvenue challenges, as both Parties requested.”  Id. at 24.  Even so, the \nconclusion is wrong.   \nFirst, at the first status conference in this case (the parties’ first \ncourt appearance), the court accepted all parties’ supplemental filings \nrelated to the original TRO motion.  Doc. 65-1 at 7; Doc. 73.  The venue \nargument thus merged into FDEM’s initial TRO response, so there could \nbe no waiver.  E.g., Seal v. Riverside Fed. Sav. Bank, 825 F. Supp. 686, \n692 n.10 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (argument raised in supplement accepted before \n16 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 21 of 52 \n \ncourt resolved motion was deemed “part of the original motion” and thus \nnot waived). \nSecond,  even  if  FDEM  had  omitted  venue  in  its  initial  TRO \nresponse,  its  venue  objection  would  not  have  been  waived.    By  rule, \nwaiver occurs only if venue is omitted from either a “responsive pleading” \nor  a  Rule  12  motion.    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(h)(1)(B)(i)-(ii).    A  brief  in \nopposition to an emergency TRO motion is neither.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a).  \nIn fact, FDEM’s response to the complaint was not even due when the \ncourt issued the preliminary injunction. \nThird, the district court’s contrary view conflicts with the Rule’s \ntext and is in tension with this Court’s precedent.  In the analogous \narbitration context, the “waiver doctrine is typically implicated when \nparties have ‘invoked the litigation machinery’ before reversing course \nand claiming that arbitration was the proper avenue all along.”  Payne v. \nSavannah Coll. of Art & Design, Inc., 81 F.4th 1187, 1201 (11th Cir. \n2023).  Under that test, there was no waiver.  FDEM did not invoke \nlitigation in the Southern District.  On the contrary, FDEM’s limited \naction before raising venue was a defensive response to Plaintiffs’ request \nfor an immediate TRO.  See Johnson v. Masselli, 2008 WL 111057, at *3 \n17 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 22 of 52 \n \n(N.D. Ind. 2008) (no waiver when defendant failed to raise venue in TRO \nresponse).  FDEM raised its venue defense at an “early stage,” permitting \nPlaintiffs  and  the  court  to  “manage  the  litigation”  appropriately.  \nGutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, 889 F.3d 1230, 1236 (11th Cir. 2018).  \nThat is not waiver.  See Lithia Ramsey-T, LLC v. City Line Auto Sales, \nLLC, 2023 WL 1883355, at *5 (D.N.J. Feb. 9, 2023) (defendant’s conduct \nin fast-moving injunction proceedings did not establish waiver); Pickett \nv. City of Houston, 2009 WL 1158842, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 29, 2009) \n(same).6 \n2.  On the merits, the court also erred.   \na.  The court grounded its venue holding in a series of acts and \nomissions  that  Plaintiffs  never  raised.    Compare  Doc.  131  at  30 \n(Plaintiffs’ venue arguments), with 34-37 (raising new venue arguments).  \n \n6  The  district  court’s  contrary  citations  miss  the  mark.    In \nManchester Knitted Fashions, Inc. v. Amalgamated Cotton Garment and \nAllied  Industry  Fund,  the  defendant  raised  venue  months  after  the \ncomplaint was filed and after stipulating to pre-hearing discovery.  967 \nF.2d 688, 692-93 (1st Cir. 1992).  And in Bautista-Perez v. Holder, venue \nwas raised after the court ruled on a preliminary-injunction motion.  681 \nF. Supp. 2d 1083, 1091-92 (N.D. Cal. 2009).  By contrast, FDEM raised \nvenue before its response to the complaint was due, before any hearing, \na  month  before  the  preliminary  injunction  issued,  and  before  any \ndiscovery was ordered. \n18 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 23 of 52 \n \nThat  violates  the  “party  presentation  principle.”    United  States  v. \nSineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375 (2020).  Courts may not “sally forth \neach day looking for” new arguments to make.  Id. at 376.  Though “a \nmodest  initiating  role  for  a  court  is  appropriate,”  the  district  court’s \nwholesale “takeover” of Plaintiffs’ venue defense “scarcely fits that bill.”  \nId. at 375-76, 379. \nb.    In  any  case,  none  of  the  acts  or  omissions  that  the  court \nidentified bears a “close nexus” to Plaintiffs’ NEPA claim.  Doc. 131 at 33.  \nPlaintiffs narrowly assert that Defendants violated NEPA by building \nthe detention facility without conducting an EIS.  Doc. 1 ¶73.  The acts \nrelevant to that claim include the facility’s construction and operation \nand related “decisionmaking.”  Friends of Earth, 2022 WL 185196, at *3.  \nAnd the “relevant omission” is the “lack of a decision to conduct” an EIS.  \nId. at *4.  The conduct the district court identified fits none of those \ncategories.  See Doc. 131 at 34-37.     \nStill other problems plague the district court’s venue theories.  It \nheld, for instance, that ICE’s Miami-based efforts to supervise detention \nat  the  facility  were  closely  related  to  the  claim.    Id.  at  35-36.    But \nPlaintiffs sued before detention operations began at the facility, Doc. 1, \n19 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 24 of 52 \n \nand “venue must be determined based on the facts at the time of filing,” \nFlowers Indus., Inc. v. FTC, 835 F.2d 775, 776 n.1 (11th Cir. 1987).  Nor \nis ICE’s Miami-based general supervision closely tied to Plaintiffs’ NEPA \nclaim, which focuses on the facility itself and activities “at the facility.”  \nC.M., 2025 WL 2400953, at *20.  Indeed, the decision to supervise, such \nas it is, would not require a NEPA analysis. \nThe court also wrongly held that transporting illegal aliens from \nMiami-based facilities to the TNT site is a relevant act.  Doc. 131 at 36.  \nThat, too, occurred after the complaint.  See Flowers, 835 F.2d at 776 n.1.  \nAnd regardless, an illegal alien’s location before reaching the facility is \nirrelevant to the administrative and environmental wrongs asserted in \nPlaintiffs’ NEPA count.  Otherwise, venue would be proper wherever a \ndetainee was previously apprehended or held.  Such a theory, if accepted, \nwould eviscerate any meaning for “close nexus.”  \nLetters FDEM sent to Miami-Dade to commandeer TNT do not \nestablish  venue,  either.    Doc.  131  at  35.    Those  letters—and  more \nimportantly,  the  decisions  conveyed  in  them—were  issued  in \nTallahassee.  E.g., FDEM Ex.60 at 22.  The location where Miami-Dade \nofficials may have opened the letters is irrelevant to the NEPA claim.  See \n20 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 25 of 52 \n \nJenkins  Brick,  321  F.3d  at  1371-72  (Venue  “focus[es]  on  relevant \nactivities of the defendant[.]”). \nEven less persuasive are the district court’s selected omissions.  It \nclaimed that FDEM’s “failure” to consult with Miami-Dade and the Tribe \nabout the facility’s potential impacts were relevant omissions in Miami-\nDade.  Doc. 131 at 35-38.  But that omission did not “give rise” to the \ndecision not to conduct an EIS, Jenkins Brick, 321 F.3d at 1371; it was, \nat best, the result of the decision not to conduct an EIS, see Cottman \nTransmission  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  Martino,  36  F.3d  291,  295  (3d  Cir.  1994); \nFriends of Earth, 2022 WL 185196, at *4.  Nor would those discussions \nhave made up a “substantial part” of the EIS, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), which \nwould have considered many other data points, see Friends of Earth, 2022 \nWL 185196, at *4.  Were that not so, venue in a NEPA case would, \ncontrary  to  the  law,  lie  anywhere  the  government  might  have \n“conduct[ed] … [EIS-related] research.”  Id. \nLast, even if the district court’s identified acts and omissions were \nrelevant,  they  are  “insubstantial”  compared  to  the  core  acts  and \nomissions  driving  Plaintiffs’  NEPA  claim  (i.e.,  the  facility’s  on-site \nconstruction and operation and related decisionmaking and the decision \n21 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 26 of 52 \n \nnot to conduct an EIS).  Lamont v. Haig, 590 F.2d 1124, 1134 n.62 (D.C. \nCir.  1978).    They  thus  do  not  establish  a  “substantial  nexus”  to  the \nSouthern District.  Friends of Earth, 2022 WL 185196, at *4. \nc.  Finally, the district court wrongly relied on harms the facility \nwill allegedly inflict in the Southern District at some undetermined point \nin the future.  Doc. 131 at 32-33, 38-40.  Venue turns on where the \ndefendants’ relevant acts or omissions occurred, not where plaintiffs may \nfeel some down-the-line “impact.”  See Leroy v. Great W. United Corp., \n443 U.S. 173, 186 (1979); Bigham v. Envirocare of Utah, Inc., 123 F. Supp. \n2d 1046, 1048 (S.D. Tex. 2000).   \nThis Court affirmed this position in Jenkins Brick, which held that, \nin assessing venue, “Congress … meant to require courts to focus on \nrelevant activities of the defendant, not of the plaintiff.”  321 F.3d at \n1371-72.  This Court expressly “approve[d] of,” id., the Eighth Circuit’s \nholding in Woodke v. Dahm, 70 F.3d 983 (8th Cir. 1995).  There, the court \nrejected  the  notion  that  the  owner  of  an  infringed  trademark  could \nestablish venue “in the district of his residency because that [wa]s” where \nhe would feel the infringement’s “ultimate effect.”  70 F.3d at 985.  The \n22 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 27 of 52 \n \ncourt  thus  held  that  a  wrong’s  “effect”  is  not  a  relevant  “action  or \nomission” when assessing venue.  Id.   \nSo too  here.   In a  NEPA challenge,  venue  is  proper  where the \nrelevant action takes place or where the decisions are made, not wherever \nan environmental effect is felt.  Friends of Earth, 2022 WL 185196, at *5.   \nB.  NEPA Does Not Apply to Florida’s Detention Facility \nPlaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on their NEPA claim.  “[P]laintiffs \nchallenging  an  agency  action  based  on  NEPA  must  do  so  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.”  Ouachita Watch League v. Jacobs, 463 \nF.3d 1163, 1173 (11th Cir. 2006).  To sue “under the APA,” a plaintiff \n“must show that there has been a final agency action.”  Id.  And because \nthe APA regulates only the federal government, the final action must be \nfederal.  E.g., Sierra Club v. FERC, 2025 WL 2178519, at *10 (D.C. Cir. \nAug. 1, 2025).  A NEPA claim thus turns on identifying final federal \ndecisionmaking.7 \n \n7 Though the district court recognized that “state agencies are not \nsubject to the APA,” it relied on this Court’s precedent to conclude that \nan APA claim sometimes can be brought against a State.  Doc. 131 at 80 \nn.39.  FDEM reserves the right to challenge that precedent.  \n23 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 28 of 52 \n \n1.  The  District  Court  Misapplied  the  Final-Agency \nAction Test \n“In the NEPA context, the ‘final agency action’ required by the APA \nmust also be a ‘major federal action’ under NEPA.”  Karst Envtl. Educ. & \nProt., Inc. v. EPA, 475 F.3d 1291, 1295 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  So, to plead a \nNEPA claim, Plaintiffs must allege some final federal agency action that \ntriggers NEPA.  Big Bend Conservation All. v. FERC, 896 F.3d 418, 424 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018).  The NEPA analysis then asks whether that final agency \naction—not some other related action—violated NEPA.  E.g., Coal. for \nUnderground Expansion v. Mineta, 333 F.3d 193, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2003) \n(asking  whether  planned  rail  expansion,  not  rail  system  generally, \nrequired NEPA analysis).  \nThe district court did not clearly identify the final agency action \nthat is the subject of its order.  Instead, it appears to have relied on a sort \nof gestalt feeling—based on the anti-segmentation rule—that somehow \nit must be able to review this facility.  Doc. 131 at 55 n.26.  But such an \nintuition  is  not  law.    Under  the  anti-segmentation  rule,  “an  agency \ncannot segment NEPA review of projects … when the entire project at \nissue is subject to federal review.”  Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs,  803  F.3d  31,  50  (D.C.  Cir.  2015)  (emphasis  added).  \n24 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 29 of 52 \n \n“[S]egmentation,” in other words, “refers only to the situation that arises \nwhen an agency arbitrarily separates related federal actions from one \nanother.”  Protect Our Parks, Inc. v. Buttigieg, 10 F.4th 758, 763 (7th Cir. \n2021).  The anti-segmentation principle “does not require the aggregation \nof federal and non-federal actions.”  Big Bend Conservation, 896 F.3d at \n424; see also Missouri ex rel. Bailey v. Dep’t of Interior, 73 F.4th 570, 580 \n(8th Cir. 2023) (same).   \nIt was thus incumbent on Plaintiffs and the district court to identify \na specific final federal agency action that was subject to NEPA.  See \nNorton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004) (final agency \naction must be “circumscribed [and] discrete”).  Seemingly recognizing \nthis requirement, the order alternatively and inconsistently suggests the \nfinal federal action was (1) the “decision to refrain from issuing an EIS,” \nDoc. 131 at 50, (2) the “decision to construct and operate the detention \ncamp,” id. at 51, (3) construction alone, id. at 50, or perhaps (4) federal \nfunding, id. at 62-64.  None of these formulations work. \n2.  Failure to Issue an EIS Is Not Final Agency Action \nWhen an agency considers a major federal project and issues a \nreasoned decision declining to issue an EIS, that may be final agency \n25 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 30 of 52 \n \naction.  Doc. 131 at 51.  But, as the district court recognized, when there \nis “no ‘NEPA-triggering’ major federal action,” then there is no “decision” \nnot to issue an EIS—the agency’s views were never implicated in the first \nplace.  Id. at 51 n.24.  Thus, the “decision” not to issue an EIS cannot \nunderlie a NEPA claim unless some other final agency action is on the \ntable.  E.g., Coal. for Underground Expansion, 333 F.3d at 196 n.6.  Said \ndifferently, the decision to issue an EIS must be paired with some other \nmajor federal action to be final agency action.  Here, there was no other \nmajor federal action.  \n3.  There Has Been No Federal Funding \nPlaintiffs also cannot ground their claim in federal funding because \nthere has been none.  FDEM Exs. 30 ¶5, 44 ¶4; Pls.’ Ex.4 ¶¶2-3.  Though \nthe federal government may one day reimburse Florida, “[t]he possibility \nthat federal funding will be provided in the future is not sufficient to \nfederalize a state project, even when such funding is likely.”  United \nStates v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d 1563, 1573 (11th Cir. 1994). \nThe district court nonetheless relied on yet-to-be-issued funding, \nreasoning that the federal government had decided, at some unspecified \npoint, to issue funds.  Doc. 131 at 62-64.  That view cannot be squared \n26 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 31 of 52 \n \nwith precedent.  Even “likely” funding does not federalize a project.  S. \nFla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1573.  The district court dismissed this \nCourt’s caselaw by concluding that funds were not just likely, but (based \nlargely on a series of press conferences and social-media posts) already \n“earmarked.”    Doc.  131  at  64.    But  even  if  true,  saying  funding  is \n“earmarked” is just another way to say it is “likely.”  S. Fla. Water Mgmt. \nDist., 28 F.3d at 1573.  That is why even a “congressional appropriation \n… of funds for a particular project does not” trigger NEPA “until the \n[agency] has reviewed a grant application and decided to disburse the \nfunds.”  See Rattlesnake Coal. v. EPA, 509 F.3d 1095, 1103 (9th Cir. \n2007).   \nThe district court’s reasoning also makes a hash of the APA.  To \nbring an APA claim, Plaintiffs must point to final agency action, not an \nintended or promised one.  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997).  \nEven if federal funding alone could trigger NEPA,8 there has been no \nviolation because the federal government could conduct a NEPA analysis \nbefore distributing the funds.  Rattlesnake Coal., 509 F.3d at 1104.  The \n \n8 It could not.  See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Dept. of Hous. \n& Urban Dev., 541 F. Supp. 2d 1091, 1098 (D. Ariz. 2008) (“[F]unding \nalone is not enough[.]’”). \n27 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 32 of 52 \n \ndistrict court’s contrary conclusion is the type of judicial guesswork the \nfinal-agency-action requirement is meant to avoid. \n4.  There Has Been No Federal Construction   \nPlaintiffs also cannot ground final agency action in the detention \nfacility’s construction.  There is no evidence that the federal government \nhad “actual power to control” construction.  S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 \nF.3d at 1572.  To the contrary, the evidence shows that a State agency \ncommandeered the site from a State municipality using State emergency \npowers.  FDEM Ex.7.  The State took control of the site.  FDEM Ex.60 \n¶21.  The State paid and directed the construction contractors.  FDEM \nEx.60 ¶22; Pls.’ Exs. 107-126.  And the State managed all construction.  \nFDEM Exs. 30 ¶5, 60 ¶21.   \nIgnoring all this, the district court relied on “evidence” that the \nfacility “was constructed at the request of the federal government.”  Doc. \n131 at 64.  As a factual matter, DHS inquired whether Florida would \nbuild a facility, but Florida decided to build this facility.  Vol. I 108:22-\n109:3.  As a legal matter, a federal request for voluntary action by a non-\nfederal  actor  is  not  final  federal  agency  action,  which  must  either \ndetermine  rights  or  obligations  or  give  rise  to  legal  consequences.  \n28 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 33 of 52 \n \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78.  A voluntary request does neither; it simply \nasks a question.  E.g., Harbert v. United States, 206 F. App’x 903, 908 \n(11th Cir. 2006); Reliable Automatic Sprinkler Co. v. Consumer Prod. \nSafety Comm’n, 324 F.3d 726, 731 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  Nor does a voluntary \nrequest trigger NEPA.  The “impetus” for a project is irrelevant under \nNEPA;  what  matters  is  whether  the  federal  government  acts,  not \nwhether a project was its idea.  Nat’l Org. for the Reform of Marijuana L. \nv. DEA, 545 F. Supp. 981, 984-85 (D.D.C. 1982).   \nIt adds nothing that Florida’s construction meets ICE’s minimum \nrequirements.  Doc. 131 at 56.  “The adoption of certain federal standards \n… cannot transform a state … project into a federal one.”  Atl. Coal. on \nTransp. Crisis, Inc. v. Atl. Reg’l Comm’n, 599 F.2d 1333, 1347 (5th Cir. \n1979).  When a State chooses to follow federal standards to advance its \nown  purposes,  it  has  not  surrendered  its  decisionmaking  to  federal \nauthorities.  If it were otherwise, thousands of state projects that meet \nfederal standards would be transformed into federal actions requiring \nNEPA analyses. \nICE’s inspections do not change that result.  Doc. 131 at 7.  ICE \ninspects to ensure the facility satisfies minimum detention standards.  \n29 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 34 of 52 \n \nFDEM Ex.60 ¶21.  But those mine-run “compliance inspections” do not \ntrigger NEPA.  Sierra Club v. Penfold, 857 F.2d 1307, 1314 (9th Cir. \n1988). \nLastly, nothing about “immigration enforcement activities” at the \nfacility reaches back in time to make the construction that preceded \nimmigration  enforcement  a  federal  project.    Doc.  131  at  55.    No \nimmigration law permits the federal government to direct states to build \nimmigration detention facilities or to oversee such construction.  And \nbecause DHS had “no authority to choose an alternative site to” TNT “or \nto force” Florida “to build” a detention center in another location, there \nwere  no  construction-related  decisions  for  the  federal  government  to \nconsider under NEPA.  Protect Our Parks, Inc., 2021 WL 3566600, at *13.   \nA hypothetical proves the point.  If, next week, a major hurricane \nforms  and  Florida  converts the  TNT  site  to  an  emergency  hurricane \nlogistics hub (as FDEM has considered, FDEM Ex.60 ¶20), then it could \ndo so (including paving, lighting, tenting, etc.) without complying with \nNEPA.  It makes little sense to say NEPA applies to that same conduct \nif the State chooses to pursue a different sovereign purpose, such as \n30 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 35 of 52 \n \npermitting its facility to be used temporarily for immigration detention.  \nNEPA, said differently, regulates federal decisions, not federal purposes.  \n5.  Detention Cannot Be the Basis for Merits Success \nPlaintiffs’ and the district court’s last option was to say the decision \nto detain is the final federal agency action that triggers NEPA.  This, too, \nfails. \na.  If the focus is on the decision where to detain—i.e., specifically \nat  the  TNT  facility—that  is  Florida’s  choice.    See  FDEM  Ex.30  ¶6.  \nFlorida may decline (and indeed has declined) to accept any illegal alien \nfor detention at the facility.  See FDEM Ex.60 ¶25; Fed. Ex.7 ¶18.  Florida \nthus has “final decision-making power” over this issue.  Ka Makani ’O \nKohala Ohana Inc. v. Water Supply, 295 F.3d 955, 961 (9th Cir. 2002).  \nAnd  because  Florida  maintains  its  “state  law  authority  to  make  the \ndecisions  concerning  the  project,”  “the  federal  government  does  not \npossess the requisite control to federalize [the] project.”  S. Fla. Water \nMgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1573. \nThe  fact  that  Florida’s  ability  to  detain  flows  from  a  287(g) \nagreement does not change this result.  Doc. 131 at 55.  The APA applies \nonly to federal agencies, not to all entities that exercise delegated federal \n31 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 36 of 52 \n \npower.  5 U.S.C. § 706.  For example, although Amtrak exercises federal \npower, it is not subject to the APA.  Lebron v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., \n513  U.S.  374,  392  (1995).    Likewise,  thousands  of  state  and  local \ngovernments also administer federal programs but are not subject to the \nAPA.  E.g., Ritter v. Cecil Cnty. Office of Hous. & Cmty. Dev., 33 F.3d 323, \n327 (4th Cir. 1994); Day v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 1052, 1064 (6th Cir. 1994).  \nFlorida’s voluntary participation in a 287(g) program therefore does not \ntrigger the APA.   \nb.  The district court suggested that major federal action is present \nbecause Florida is carrying out ICE’s general detention decisions as a \n“functionary” of ICE.  Doc. 131 at 56-59.  Even if that were so, Plaintiffs \ncould not prevail because detention decisions cannot support a NEPA \nclaim. \nFirst, federal courts lack authority to review detention decisions \nunder  8  U.S.C.  §  1226(e)—an  INA  provision  that  the  district  court \nignored, despite FDEM repeatedly raising it.  Vol. III 19:19-20:17; Vol. V \n109:19-111:9.  Section 1226(a) grants DHS the discretion to detain aliens \n32 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 37 of 52 \n \npending a removal decision.9  Section 1226(e), in turn, states that the \n“discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall \nnot be subject to review,” and “[n]o court may set aside any action or \ndecision  by  [DHS]  under  this  section  regarding  the  detention  of  any \nalien.”    Section  1226(e)  thus  “precludes”  challenges  to  “a  decision  … \nregarding [an alien’s] detention or release.”  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 \nU.S. 281, 295 (2018).  \nUnder section 1226(e), Plaintiffs cannot succeed if the final agency \naction they attack is ICE’s decision to detain the aliens who are housed \nin  the  TNT  facility  under  section  1226.    No  Court  has  authority  to \n“review” those decisions, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(e), and thus no court can say \nDHS  “exercised  its  statutory  authority  in  an  unreasonable  fashion” \nbecause it acted without first performing an EIS, Nielsen v. Preap, 586 \nU.S. 392, 401 (2019).  \nThe district court trampled that limitation.  Although it nodded to \nthe idea that courts cannot decide “where or how the government must \nhouse immigration detainees,” Doc. 131 at 18, it nonetheless prohibited \n \n9 Although the statute refers to the Attorney General, Congress \nreallocated the power to DHS under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, \nPub. L. No. 107-296, § 402, 116 Stat. 2135, 2178 (2002). \n33 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 38 of 52 \n \nDHS from housing “additional persons [at] the TNT site,” id. at 80.  That \nis the precise type of judicial takeover that section 1226(e) prohibits.  \nSecond, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f) bars Plaintiffs’ claim.  Section 1252(f)(1) \nprovides  that  “no  court  (other  than  the  Supreme  Court)  shall  have \njurisdiction  or  authority  to  enjoin  or  restrain  the  operation  of  the \nprovisions of part IV of this subchapter.”  Section 1252(f) thus “generally \nprohibits  lower  courts  from  entering  injunctions  that  order  federal \nofficials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, \nor otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions.”  Garland v. \nAleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. 543, 550 (2022).  Those specified provisions \ninclude two powers relevant here: the authority for detention in section \n1226 and the authority to “arrange for appropriate places of detention for \naliens detained pending removal or a decision on removal” in section \n1231(g)(1).  \nSection  1252(f)  forecloses  Plaintiffs’  claim  because  they  ask  to \n“[e]njoin  any  …  use  of  the  TNT  Site  for  purposes  of  immigration \ndetention.”  Doc. 1 at 26.  Plaintiffs thus want an injunction that requires \nthe federal government “to refrain from” detaining aliens at a facility that \nthe government believes is appropriate for detention.  Aleman Gonzalez, \n34 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 39 of 52 \n \n596 U.S. at 550.  That would “interfere with the Government’s efforts to \noperate” sections 1226 and 1231(g) by narrowing its authority.  Id.  The \npreliminary injunction proves the point.  It strips the federal government \nof  the  power  to  deem  the  TNT  facility  an  “appropriate  place[]  of \ndetention” and forces it to use other facilities or release detainees.  See \nDoc. 138-1 ¶17. \nThe district court concluded section 1252(f) is irrelevant because “it \nprohibits” injunctions only “against certain provisions of the INA” and \nPlaintiffs ask for “NEPA compliance.”  Doc. 131 at 20-21.  But section \n1252(f) does not “depend on the nature of the claim in question,” Aleman \nGonzalez, 596 U.S. at 553, and bars injunctive relief if it will “restrain \nthe operation” of the INA “[r]egardless of the nature of the action,” 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(f).  And contra the district court’s characterizations, Doc. \n131 at 20-21, the preliminary injunction “restrain[s]” DHS’s ability to \nenforce sections 1226 and 1231 as DHS deems appropriate.  To be sure, \nthe district court believes DHS can enforce the immigration laws despite \nthe injunction.  Id. at 77.  But that is the kind of judicial second-guessing \nthe statute forbids: Section 1252(f) applies when an injunction requires \n35 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 40 of 52 \n \nofficials “to refrain from actions that (… in the Government’s view) are \nallowed by § 1231.”  Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. at 551.   \nThird, detention decisions cannot ground a NEPA claim because \nthey are committed to agency discretion by law.  5 U.S.C. § 701; United \nStates  v.  Texas,  599  U.S.  670,  679  (2023)  (immigration  enforcement \ncommitted to executive discretion); Geo Grp., Inc. v. Newsom, 50 F.4th \n745, 751 (9th Cir. 2022) (“Section 1231(g)(1) gives … broad discretion to \nthe Secretary to choose the place of detention for deportable aliens.”).  \nThis discretionary power cannot be superintended by the courts.  E.g., \nSinclair v. Att’y Gen., 198 F. App’x 218, 222 (3d Cir. 2006).   \nThe district court did not dispute that point.  Doc. 131 at 59.  It \nreasoned, however, that the relevant decision was the “decision not to \ncomply with NEPA.”  Id.  But a NEPA claim must point to final agency \naction.  And the “decision” not to conduct a NEPA analysis, as the district \ncourt elsewhere recognized, is not final agency action unless it is paired \nwith major federal action.  Id. at 51 n.24.  The district court’s reasoning \nthus collapses on itself: some agency action must be the “major federal \naction,” and detention cannot be it because it is committed to agency \ndiscretion.   \n36 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 41 of 52 \n \n  Fourth,  any  decision  related  to  detention  is  definitionally  not \nsubject to NEPA.  NEPA applies only to “major federal actions,” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 4332(C), but specifically excluded is “bringing … administrative civil or \ncriminal enforcement actions,” id. § 4336e(10)(B)(v).  Thus, decisions to \n“enforce”  the  “laws”—like  the  immigration  enforcement  here—never \nrequire NEPA review.  See Nw. Ctr. for Alternatives to Pesticides v. DHS, \n552 F. Supp. 3d 1078, 1091 (D. Or. 2021).   \n  The district court rejected that limitation, reasoning that “[t]he \nconstruction and operation of an immigration detention facility is plainly \nnot an enforcement action.”  Doc. 131 at 59.  That reasoning highlights \nthe district court’s irreconcilable rationales.  When it came to defining \nthe  federal  decision  for  APA  purposes,  the  district  court  relied  on \n“immigration enforcement activities.”  Id. at 55.  But to avoid NEPA’s \nlimitation, the district court shifted away from that focus.  It cannot be \nboth: if detention is the federal decision, then there is no major federal \naction.  If detention is not the federal decision, then detention plays no \nrole in the analysis.   \n37 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 42 of 52 \n \nC.  Plaintiffs Are Unlikely to Obtain Injunctive Relief \nNEPA errors “may not necessarily require a court to vacate the \nagency’s ultimate approval of a project, at least absent reason to believe \nthat the agency might disapprove the project if it added more to the EIS.”  \nSeven Cnty. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cnty., 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1514 \n(2025).  In deciding whether to vacate, courts balance “the disruptive \nconsequences of vacatur” and “the seriousness of the order’s deficiencies.”  \nCity of Port Isabel v. FERC, 130 F.4th 1034, 1036 (D.C. Cir. 2025).   \nVacatur  would  be  “disruptive”  because  the  TNT  site  is \n“operational.”  Food & Water Watch v. FERC, 28 F.4th 277, 292 (D.C. Cir. \n2022).  Halting the project forces Florida and DHS to release detainees \nor send them to overcrowded facilities.  Doc. 138-1 ¶¶12, 17.  The district \ncourt did not disagree: it based its decision on the second factor.  See Doc. \n131 at 66-67. \nBut  that  factor  supports  remand.    Any  deficiency  in  DHS’s \ndecisionmaking was minor because DHS had good reason to believe that \nNEPA did not apply given the minimal federal involvement here.  Nor is \nthere any reason to think that additional NEPA process would change \nthe outcome.  Seven Cnty., 145 S. Ct. at 1514.  The project has the support \n38 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 43 of 52 \n \nof  the  President  and  the  DHS  Secretary,  promotes  a  critical  federal \npolicy, and risks minimal environmental impact.  It blinks reality to \nthink that DHS would forgo a “blueprint for detention facilities” that \ndetains the “worst of the worst,” Pls.’ Ex.44 at 5, if only some national \nsecurity specialist spent more time poring over panther telemetry.  \nD.  Plaintiffs Did Not Establish Irreparable Harm \nPlaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm.  Siegel, 234 F.3d at \n1176.  Irreparable harm must be “neither remote nor speculative, but \nactual and imminent.”  Ne. Fla. Chapter of Ass’n of Gen. Contractors of \nAm.  v.  City  of  Jacksonville,  896  F.2d  1283,  1285  (11th  Cir.  1990).  \nEstablishing  irreparable  harm  requires  a  showing  that  “irreparable \ninjury  is  likely”—a  mere  “possibility”  of  harm  is  not  enough  for  the \nextraordinary remedy of injunctive relief.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.   \nPlaintiffs presented only speculation.  Consider Plaintiffs’ so-called \nexperts: \n•  Kautz testified that the combination of habitat loss and global \nwarming might harm panther populations by 2070.  But he \ndid not study the relative impact this facility would have on \nthat baseline loss.  Vol. I 286:17-20.  And he did not study \nwhether this project would result in additional panther take.  \nId. 287:10-12.  \n•  McVoy  testified  that  the  Everglades  is  an  interconnected \necosystem  that  could  be  harmed  if  nutrient-dense  water \n39 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 44 of 52 \n \nenters it.  But he conceded that FDEM’s construction was \noccurring on developed land, Vol. II 52:15-18, and he did not \nexamine  whether  discharge  from  this  site  would  produce \nnutrient-dense water, id. 58:12-16. \n•  Reio testified that paving would cause more runoff in a 100-\nyear,  72-hour  storm.    And  he  opined  that  runoff  might \nincrease polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) levels.  But \nhe neither examined pre-existing PAH levels, id. 88:17-25, nor \ncompared  PAH  production  between  airport  and  detention-\nfacility uses, id. 89:5-14.  \nThe  district  court  nonetheless  excused  that  lackluster  showing, \nreasoning that “Plaintiffs are not required to prove harms of a particular \nprobability  or  quantity.”    Doc.  131  at  69;  id.  at  68  (“possible \ncontaminant”); id. at 69 (“could be”); id. at 71 (“may well”).  That is \nprecisely the view Winter rejected.  See 555 U.S. at 22 (“[T]he Ninth \nCircuit’s ‘possibility’ standard is too lenient.”).  Even in a NEPA case (like \nWinter),  “plaintiffs  seeking  preliminary  relief”  must  make  a  “clear \nshowing” that “irreparable injury is likely.”  Id.  By relying on speculative \nand unlikely injuries, the district court erred.  \nPlaintiffs’ harm analysis also started from the wrong place.  None \nof the experts had an ecological baseline because they did not consider \nthe preexisting effects of an active airport with 28,000 flights in the last \nsix months.  Vol. I 253:8-21; Vol. II 65:1-13, 88:12-89:14.  As a result, none \nof the experts could opine on the expected effect of the facility.  E.g., City \n40 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 45 of 52 \n \nof Austin v. Kinder Morgan Tex. Pipeline, LLC, 447 F. Supp. 3d 558, 569 \n(W.D. Tex. 2020) (determining environmental effects requires “analysis \nof the environmental baseline”). \nBut even if they had opined from a true baseline, Plaintiffs’ experts \noffered  such  long-tailed  harms  that  nothing  they  pointed  to  was \n“imminent.”  Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176.  Even the district court recognized \nas much: “the harms Plaintiffs fear take time to accrue.”  Doc. 131 at 70 \nn.31.  But that is just another way of saying that Plaintiffs’ harms were \nneither  “imminent”  nor  “likely  in  the  absence”  of  a  pre-judgment \ninjunction.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.   \nPlaintiffs’ fact witnesses fared no better.  They testified that they \nwould like to recreate in the Big Cypress National Preserve.  But the \nPreserve is 729,000 acres.  And Plaintiffs’ fact witnesses did not testify \nthat this site is where they would like to recreate.  Indeed, no one could \ncredibly claim that they want to enjoy nature at a busy, noisy airport, \nsurrounded by barbed wire.   \nE.  The Balance of Equities Did Not Support an Injunction \nIn considering a preliminary injunction, “a court must balance the \ncompeting claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of \n41 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 46 of 52 \n \nthe granting or withholding of the requested relief.”  Amoco Prod. Co. v. \nVill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987).  Courts “should pay particular \nregard  for  the  public  consequences  in  employing  the  extraordinary \nremedy of injunction.”  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 \n(1982). \nWinter is instructive.  There, under NEPA, a district court required \n“the  Navy  to  shut  down  its  MFA  sonar”  in  the  presence  of  marine \nmammals.  555 U.S. at 27.  The Supreme Court reversed, explaining that \nthe balance was “strongly in favor” of the government because “harm to \nan unknown number of the marine mammals” could not outweigh the \nnational security interests in “the safety of the fleet.”  Id. at 26.  Here, \nlikewise, the speculative and far-off environmental concerns raised by \nPlaintiffs from the conversion of a busy airport to a temporary detention \nfacility  are  outweighed  by  the  very  real  and  immediate  need  for \nadditional,  effective  detention  space  to  stem  a  national  and  state \nemergency.  “The problems posed … by illegal immigration” from “crime ” \nand “safety risks” “must not be underestimated.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at \n398.  Thus, the “public interest demands effective measures to prevent \n42 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 47 of 52 \n \nthe illegal entry of aliens.”  United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, \n878 (1975). \nHere, both the federal and State governments have declared an \nunprecedented illegal immigration emergency.  As Governor DeSantis \nexplained, “unauthorized alien interdictions in and around Florida have \nrisen to alarming levels.”  FDEM Ex.7 at 1; see Doc. 137-1 ¶3.  President \nTrump added that “[m]any of these aliens unlawfully within the United \nStates present significant threats to national security and public safety.”  \nExec. Order No. 14159, Protecting the American People Against Invasion \n(Jan.  20,  2025).    “Enforcing  our  Nation’s  immigration  laws  is”  thus \n“critically important.”  Id. \nEnjoining Florida’s detention facility imperils those immigration-\nenforcement efforts.  Florida’s facility “operationally benefits ICE as it … \nmaximize[s]  detention  capacity  …  [and]  serve[s] to  decompress other \ndetention facilities.”  FDEM Ex.30 ¶11.  Put differently, immigration \nenforcement currently faces a bottleneck.  Though the country has an \nunprecedented  number  of  unlawfully  present  aliens,  effective \nenforcement is cabined by scarce detention capacity.  Vol. IV 193:24-\n194:2, 195:12-15, 195:20-22, 202:20-25; Doc. 137-1 ¶5; Doc. 138-1.  That \n43 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 48 of 52 \n \nis why the federal government asked if Florida could provide additional \nState capacity.  Enjoining the creation or operation of that additional bed \nspace forces federal and state officials to either release aliens or hold \nthem in overcrowded facilities.  Doc. 137-1 ¶6; Doc. 138-1 ¶13.  Both \noptions risk immediate public safety harm.  Vol. IV 191:7-19, 203:1-3.   \nII.  THE EQUITIES SUPPORT A STAY \nA stay is necessary to avoid irreparable harm to the State.  For one, \nthe injunction irreparably harms the State because it stops Florida’s \nexecutive branch from taking action that Florida law empowers it to take.  \nCASA, 145 S. Ct. at 2562; Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012).  \nFor another, the injunction risks harm to the public, law enforcement, \nand detainees.  By requiring the State to cease taking new detainees and \nultimately shutter the facility, the injunction will lead to either harmful \novercrowding, Rosa v. McAleenan, 583 F. Supp. 3d 850, 864 (S.D. Tex. \n2019), or to the release of additional illegal aliens, which risks public \nsafety, see Doc. 137-1 ¶¶4-5; Doc. 138-1 ¶17.  Finally, the injunction forces \nFlorida to incur irrecoverable costs.  See Doc. 137-2 ¶¶3-4; Nat’l Insts. of \n44 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 49 of 52 \n \nHealth v. Am. Pub. Health Ass’n, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (U.S. Aug. 21, \n2025). \nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons, FDEM respectfully requests that this Court: \n(1)  grant an immediate administrative stay of the preliminary \ninjunction until this motion is briefed and decided (because \nthe district court immediately enjoined new detention at the \nfacility); \n(2)  stay  enforcement  of  the  preliminary  injunction  until  this \nappeal is decided (because FDEM has met the stay factors); \n(3)  stay further merits proceedings until this appeal is decided \n(because  the  district  court  lacks  venue  and  further \nproceedings are improper); \n(4)  expedite the response and reply deadlines for this motion and \nrule as soon as practicable; and \n(5)  if  the  Court  does  not  stay  the  preliminary  injunction  and \nmerits proceedings, expedite briefing, argument, and decision \nof this appeal.  \n   \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n45 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-12873     Document: 11-2     Date Filed: 08/26/2025     Page: 50 of 52 \n \nDated: August 26, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nJames Uthmeier  s/ Jesse Panuccio   \n  Attorney General of Florida  Jesse Panuccio (FBN 31401) \nJeffrey Paul DeSousa (FBN 110951)  Evan Ezray (FBN 1008228) \nActing Solicitor General  David Costello (FBN 1004952) \nNathan A.

Also before the Court are Defendant Executive Director Kevin \nGuthrie (“Guthrie” or the “State”) and Defendants Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting \nDirector Todd Lyons’ (together, “Federal Defendants”) venue challenges. (DE 50; DE \n60). The Renewed Motion for TRO and the improper venue challenge are fully briefed.1 \nFor the reasons set forth below and stated on the record during the August 7, 2025 \nHearing, Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for TRO (DE 40) is GRANTED IN PART AND \nDENIED IN PART.2 \n \n1 All Defendants responded in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \n(DE 12; DE 16; DE 21), which addresses the arguments reiterated in Plaintiffs’ Renewed \nMotion for TRO, and Plaintiffs replied (DE 24). Defendant Guthrie and the Federal \nDefendants responded to Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for TRO specifically, (DE 50; DE \n60), and Plaintiffs replied (DE 45; DE 46). \n2 A more comprehensive recitation of the proceedings and the case authority supporting \ninjunctive relief will follow in a supporting memorandum.   \nPage 1 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 2 of 13\nI.  BACKGROUND  \nThe Court provides an abbreviated background meant to contextualize this Order. \nOn June 23, 2025, the Florida Division of Emergency Management (“FDEM”) took control \nof the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (“TNT”), in order to construct a mass \nmigrant detention and deportation facility (“Facility”). (DE 1 ¶¶ 1, 39). Two days later, \nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that the Facility “is fully funded by the federal \ngovernment  .  .  .  [and]  was  requested  by  the  federal  government.”  (Id.  ¶  35). Pre-\nconstruction and construction activities at TNT began that week. (Id. ¶¶ 40–42). According \nto Plaintiffs, no environmental assessment or impact statement as required by law was \nprepared prior to building on this protected land. (Id. ¶ 43).  \nOn June 27, 2025, non-profit environmental organizations Friends and CBD filed \nthis suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the Facility’s construction and \noperation until the project complied with certain relevant federal, state, and local laws. (Id.  \n¶¶ 1, 8, 13). Most notably, Plaintiffs claim the project is being built and operated in \nviolation of the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), which requires that major \nfederal actions significantly affecting the human environment undergo environmental \nreview processes. (Id. ¶¶ 61–74) (Count I). Because no such review has been done, \nPlaintiffs claim, the approval and use of the Facility by the United States Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”), including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), is \nunlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). (Id. ¶¶ 75–79) (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701 et seq.) (Count II).3  \n \n3 Plaintiffs further claim the State’s participation in the project through FDEM exceeds the \ndepartment’s authority under Florida Statutes Chapters 252 and 944. (DE 1 ¶¶ 80–87) \n(Count  III).  Finally,  Plaintiffs  allege  Defendant  Miami-Dade  County  (“Miami-Dade”) \nPage 2 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 3 of 13\nOn the same day, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction (DE 5), \nrequesting that the Court enjoin the State and the Federal Defendants from developing \nor using the TNT site as an immigration detention facility “unless and until Defendants \ncomply with NEPA and the APA.” (DE 5 at 1–2, 14). Within the following week, all \nDefendants responded, (DE 12; DE 16; DE 21), among other arguments, and Plaintiffs \nreplied. (DE 24).  \nThe Federal Defendants attached a declaration from Thomas Giles, Acting Deputy \nExecutive Associate Director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (DE 21-1). \nAmong other things, Giles declared that any detentions at the Facility would be pursuant \nto “section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [(“INA”)], codified at 8 U.S.C § \n1357(g).” (DE 21-1 ¶ 7).  \nA few weeks later, Plaintiffs filed a Renewed Motion for TRO, explaining that since \nthey filed suit, the “State and Federal Defendants commenced transporting immigration \ndetainees to the TNT [s]ite,” that, according to State officials, “as many as 900 people are \nnow being detained at the [s]ite, and [that] the State has plans to expand the number of \ndetainees to as many as 4,000.” (DE 40 at 2). Given the completion of the Facility’s first \nphase of construction and its ongoing operations, Plaintiffs altered their request for \ninjunctive relief, now seeking a “halt [to] any further construction on the TNT [s]ite . . ., [a] \npause[ to] the transport of additional detainees to the [s]ite, and [the] ceasing [of] any \n \nunlawfully acquiesced in allowing their property, TNT, to be used as a detention facility \nwithout the proper permits and in violation of county code. (Id. ¶¶ 88–94) (Count IV). \nThese last two counts are not part of the basis for Plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief.  \nPage 3 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 4 of 13\noperations related to detaining or preparing for the detention of anyone not [already] \ndetained at the [s]ite[.]” (Id. at 6).4     \nOn July 21, 2025, the State filed a Supplemental Response to Plaintiffs’ Requests \nfor a Temporary Restraining Order (“Supplemental Response on Venue”), arguing for \nthe first time that “venue is not proper in this Court.” (DE 50 at 1).  At a Status Conference \nthe next day, the Court set a briefing schedule on the issue and oral arguments for July \n30, 2025. (DE 54). The Court also set an evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction (“Preliminary Injunction Hearing”) for August 6, 2025. (Id.). The \nCourt heard oral arguments regarding venue on July 30, 2025, (DE 72 (“Hearing on \nVenue”)), at which time Plaintiffs renewed their motion for a TRO. In light of the upcoming \nevidentiary hearing, the Court denied the ore tenus motion. \nIn the days leading up to the Preliminary Injunction Hearing, the Parties exchanged \nexhibit and witness lists. (DE 81; DE 82; DE 87; DE 90; DE 91). The Parties estimated \nthe Preliminary Injunction Hearing would require one day. On August 6, 2025, the Court \nbegan the Hearing, and heard testimony from Friends Executive Director Eve Samples, \nState Representative Anna Eskamani, Friends member Jessica Namath, CBD member \nAmber Crooks, and retired United States Fish and Wildlife and Florida Fish and Wildlife \necologist Randy Kautz, who specializes in panther habitat and population dynamics. \nAmong other testimony, the Court heard from Representative Eskamani that during her \ntour of the TNT site on July 12, 2025, Defendant Guthrie informed her that this Facility \nwas the result of a written request from DHS to open a detention facility in the state. \n \n4 The case was originally assigned to Judge Jose Martinez, (DE 2), but was reassigned \nto this Court on July 16, 2025. (DE 37).   \nPage 4 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 5 of 13\nCrooks, Namath, and Samples discussed their use of the area around the TNT site for \noutdoors activities and the harm to their enjoyment of the area that has resulted from road \nclosures, increased lighting, and increased traffic due to the project. In particular, Plaintiffs \nintroduced  photos  from  Namath  showing  industrial  lighting  and  heavy  construction \nmachinery entering the site. She also testified that the artificial lighting brought in for the \nproject significantly increased the brightness from the site for miles compared to her \nrecent nighttime trips to the area just months before the project. Namath further testified \nthat in the few days prior to the Preliminary Injunction Hearing, she had seen multiple \ntrucks conveying equipment and paving materials entering the site, along with trucks and \nvans bearing ICE and CBP insignias. Finally, Namath testified that each time she had \ncalled Governor DeSantis’ office to inquire about the project, she was told this was a \nfederal project and she would need to speak with her United States senators. Kautz \ndiscussed serious risks to the endangered Florida panther from the site, including a loss \nof around 2,000 acres of habitat due to the increased artificial lighting. Kautz opined that \nhe would have expected U.S. Fish and Wildlife to have conducted a review of the project \nprior to its construction.  \nAlthough the Court heard testimony into the early evening, the Parties agreed the \nPreliminary Injunction Hearing would not conclude that day. At that time, counsel for the \nState and Federal Defendants informed the Court that they had scheduling conflicts which \nwould preclude resumption of the proceedings until the following Tuesday. After some \ndiscussion with the Court, the Parties agreed that the Hearing could proceed the next day \nfor just a half day and would then resume the following Tuesday.  \nPage 5 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 6 of 13\nThe Court reconvened the case on August 7, 2025, and heard testimony from \nwetland  ecologist,  hydrologist,  and  soil  physics  expert  Dr.  Christopher  McVoy  and \nhydrogeologist Dillon Reio. Both witnesses opined that at least 20 acres of the site had \nbeen newly paved with asphalt. Both also testified that this 800,000 square feet of paving \npresented risks off runoff into the surrounding, unique wetland ecosystem, which could \nimpede the natural flow of and introduce contaminants into the natural water system \naround the site. According to both witnesses, despite the possible presence of silt fencing \non site, the lack of a stormwater management system risked harm to the habitat and \nanimals.  \nAt the close of the day’s testimony, Plaintiffs renewed their request for a limited \nTRO, citing new fears that Defendants planned to add paving and other infrastructure \nover the weekend, while the Hearing was in recess. Plaintiffs based these fears, in part, \non Ms. Namath’s testimony that she watched paving and construction materials entering \nthe site that week. Specifically, Plaintiffs requested that the Court prevent any additional \nindustrial-style lighting, paving, filling, excavating, site preparation, or fencing. The Court \ninquired as to whether Defendants would agree that no such construction would take \nplace over the five-day hiatus. Defendants were unwilling to make this representation.  \nConsequently, the Court heard argument on Plaintiffs’ request. During argument, \nthe  Federal  Defendants  conceded  that  the  project  was  operating  under  a  287(g) \nagreement  between  the  Florida  Department  of  Law  Enforcement  (“FDLE”),  whose \nfederally deputized officers operate the Facility, and ICE or DHS. As the Court noted, \nwhen “performing a function under” a 287(g) agreement, “an officer or employee of a \nState or political subdivision of a State shall be subject to the direction and supervision of \nPage 6 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 7 of 13\nthe Attorney General.” § 1357(g)(3). In other words, by law, the federal government, \nthrough DHS or ICE, has “the authority to influence” the State’s operation of the Facility. \nUnited States v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d 1563, 1572 (11th Cir. 1994) (calling \n“a federal agency’s authority to influence nonfederal activity” the “touchstone of major \nfederal activity,” which would trigger NEPA). After hearing argument on the motion, the \nCourt granted Plaintiffs’ narrow request for a TRO.  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes courts to grant a \npreliminary injunction or temporary restraining order before final judgment in limited \ncircumstances. The purpose of this injunctive relief is to “preserve the status quo until the \n[Court] renders a meaningful decision on the merits.” Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, \n403 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005). The primary difference between a preliminary \ninjunction and a TRO is that a TRO “may be entered before the defendant has an \nadequate opportunity to respond.” Dragados USA, Inc. v. Oldcastle Infrastructure, Inc., \nNo. 20-cv-20601, 2020 WL 733037, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 13, 2020). As such, the duration \nof a TRO is limited to fourteen days, absent an extension for good cause. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n65(b)(2).  \nTo merit a TRO, as with a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show:  \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the [TRO] is \nnecessary  to  prevent  irreparable  injury;  (3)  that  the  threatened  injury \noutweighs the harm the [TRO] would cause the other litigant; and (4) that \nthe [TRO] would not be averse to the public interest. \n \nGissendaner v. Comm’r, Ga. Dept. of Corr., 779 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting \nWellons v. Comm’r, Ga. Dept. of Corr., 754 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir. 2014)); see also \nWindsor v. United States, 379 F. App’x 912, 916–17 (11th Cir. 2010) (explaining that “the \nPage 7 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 8 of 13\nfour criteria for obtaining a preliminary injunction are identical to those for issuance of a \ntemporary restraining order”).  \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nThe Court will begin by briefly addressing Defendants’ arguments regarding venue \nand the Court’s jurisdiction to enjoin Defendants’ conduct under 8 U.S.C. § 1252. The \nState and Federal Defendants each argue that venue in the Southern District of Florida \nis improper.5 (DE 50 at 1; DE 60 at 1). While the Court will take up Defendants’ challenges \nin due course, “[v]enue is not a jurisdictional prerequisite and its presence or absence \ndoes not affect [the] [C]ourt’s authority to adjudicate” Plaintiffs’ request. Harris Corp v. \nNat’l  Iranian  Radio  and  Television,  691  F.2d  1344,  1349  (11th  Cir.  1982).  Federal \nDefendants agreed with this assessment during the Hearing on Venue. (DE 89 at 46 \n(agreeing the Court was “correct” that “venue isn’t a jurisdictional question”)). Given the \nurgency Defendants’ actions create, and the possibility of additional evidence being \nadduced relevant to the Court’s venue analysis, the Court will withhold ruling on the venue \nchallenge pending the conclusion of the Preliminary Injunction Hearing. See S. Visions, \nLLP v. Red Diamond, Inc., No. 18-cv-04566, 2018 WL 8221528, at *4–5 (N.D. Ga. Dec. \n10, 2018) (deciding that venue was improper and the case would be transferred, but \nnonetheless ruling on plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction “in the interest of justice \nand judicial economy”); Arval Serv. Lease S.A. v. Clifton, No. 14-cv-1047, 2014 WL \n12614422, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 14, 2014) (deferring ruling on defendants’ motion to \ntransfer venue until after resolving plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction due to the \n“urgency of the issues”). \n \n5 Defendant Miami-Dade County has not challenged venue.  \nPage 8 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 9 of 13\nWhile  Defendants’  §  1252  challenge  is  framed  as  jurisdictional,  the  Court \nconcludes it is without merit. Section 1252 governs “Congress’s comprehensive scheme \nfor judicial review of removal orders.” Canal A Media Holding, LLC v. U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigr. Servs., 964 F.3d 1250, 1256–57 (11th Cir. 2020). As relevant here, section \n1252(f)(1) provides that “no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction \nor  authority  to  enjoin  or  restrain  the  operation  of  the  provisions  of  part  IV  of  this \nsubchapter[.]”  In  other  words,  “[i]t  prohibits  federal  courts  from  granting  classwide \ninjunctive relief” against certain provisions of the INA, specifically §§ 1221–1231. Reno v. \nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999). \nSimilarly, section 1252(g) bars judicial review over “any cause or claim by or on \nbehalf  of  any  alien  arising  from  the  decision  or  action  by  the  Attorney  General  to \ncommence  proceedings,  adjudicate  cases,  or  execute  removal  orders  against  any \nalien[.]”  28  U.S.C.  §  1252(g).  It  “is  specifically  directed  at  the  deconstruction, \nfragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal proceedings.” A.A.D.C., 525 U.S. at \n487. “[Section] 1252(g) is not to be construed broadly as a ‘zipper’ clause applying to the \nfull universe of deportation-related claims, but instead as applying narrowly to only the \nthree ‘discrete’ governmental actions enumerated in that subsection.” Wallace v. Sec’y, \nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 616 F. App’x 958, 960 (11th Cir. 2015) (citing A.A.D.C., \n525 U.S. at 472–73). “And although many other decisions or actions may be part of the \ndeportation process, only claims that arise from one of the covered actions are excluded \nfrom [a court’s] review[.]” Camarena v. Dir., Immigr. and Customs Enf’t, 988 F.3d 1268, \n1272 (11th Cir. 2021) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  \nPage 9 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 10 of 13\nPlaintiffs are not challenging the Attorney General’s decision to commence or \nadjudicate  removal proceedings.  And  they do  not  challenge  the  Attorney General’s \ndecision  or  action  to  execute  any  removal  order.  Instead,  Plaintiffs  challenge  the \ncontinued operation of a facility they allege violates NEPA requirements. Thus, Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are not barred by § 1252(g). See Canal A Media Holding, LLC, 946 F.3d at 1257–\n58 (claim was not barred by § 1252(g) where action did not fall into one of three categories \nas “[w]hen asking if a claim is barred by § 1252(g), courts must focus on the action being \nchallenged”). \nFurther,  Plaintiffs  are  not  asking  this  Court  to  stop  or  suspend  immigration \nenforcement, such that § 1252(f)(1) would be triggered. Indeed, the injunctive relief they \nseek  is  compliance  with  NEPA  requirements,  and  in  the  interim,  a  cessation  of \nconstruction activities on the TNT site. At most, that relief could have “some collateral \neffect on the operation of” the government’s immigration detention efforts under § 1231, \nwhich does not trigger § 1252(f)(1). Texas v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 123 F.4th 186, \n209 (5th Cir. 2024) (quoting Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. 543, 553 n.4 (2022)). \nIn short, because Plaintiffs do not seek to “enjoin or restrain the operation” of any \nimmigration statute, § 1252(f) is inapplicable. \nTurning to the TRO factors, the Court addressed Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success \non the merits at some length in open court. But “NEPA requires federal agencies to \nprepare an environmental impact statement, or EIS” before constructing or operating \n“projects that are built, funded, or approved by the Federal Government.” Seven Cnty. \nInfrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cnty., 145 S. Ct. 1507, 1507 (2025). At this early stage, the \nCourt finds that, at minimum, the Federal Defendants’ legal control over the Facility’s \nPage 10 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 11 of 13\noperations, evidence that the Facility’s construction was at the request of DHS, and the \nregular inspections of the site by ICE officials, combined with the undisputed lack of any \nprior  environmental  assessment  pursuant  to  NEPA,  create  a  sufficient  likelihood  of \nsuccess on Plaintiffs’ APA claim based on NEPA. See S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d \nat 1572; Goos v. I.C.C., 911 F.2d 1283, 1294 (8th Cir. 1990) (“While we must consider \nboth legal and factual control, whether an agency action or project is part of some other \nconcededly major federal action depends largely on whether the agency exercises legal \ncontrol over the allegedly non-federal action or project.”). \n“A fundamental purpose of NEPA is ‘to ensure that important effects will not be \noverlooked or underestimated only to be discovered after resources have been committed \nor the die otherwise case.’” Fla. Wildlife Fed’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 404 F. Supp. \n2d 1352, 1362 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989)). If further expansion of the site is not temporarily paused, \n“these  as  yet  unexamined  effects  [c]ould  begin  to  take  place,  and  no  amount  of \nsubsequent environmental analysis would undo them.” Id. (citing Protect Key West, Inc. \nv. Cheney, 795 F. Supp. 1552, 1563 (S.D. Fla. 1992) (“Irreparable harm results where \nenvironmental concerns have not been addressed by the NEPA process”)).  \n For similar reasons, the balance of equities and the public interest favor granting \na TRO. “These two factors merge when, as here, the government is the opposing party.” \nFarmworker Ass’n of Fla. v. Moody, 734 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2024) (internal \nquotations omitted). The harm to Defendants from briefly suspending expansion of the \nFacility is minimal, especially given that the Court is not enjoining continued operations \nof the site nor even preventing additional detainees from being brought to the site if \nPage 11 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 12 of 13\ncurrent capacity allows.6 Meanwhile, if the site is expanded over the next several days, \n“it is difficult to change that course” if the Court eventually decides NEPA statements are \nrequired. Sierra Club v. Marsh, 872 F.2d 497, 500, 505 (1st Cir. 1989) (vacating district \ncourt’s denial of preliminary injunction related to NEPA claim and remanding).   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above and in open court, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED \nas follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for TRO (DE 40) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED \nIN PART.  \n2.  The Court ENTERS a Temporary Restraining Order prohibiting the State and \nFederal Defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any \nperson who is in active concert or participation with them from installing any \nadditional industrial-style lighting (described by witnesses as “Sunbelt” lighting); or \ndoing any paving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, \nincluding placing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other \nresidential or administrative facilities on the TNT site. This TRO shall last fourteen \n(14) days from the date of this Order or until the Court enters an order as to \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The TRO shall include among those \n“who are in active concert or participation with” the State or Federal Defendants or \ntheir officers, agents, employees, or attorneys, and thus prohibited from conducting \n \n6 As Governor DeSantis observed following today’s Hearing, “Operations at [the Facility] \nare ongoing and deportations continuing.” @GovRonDeSantis, X (August 7, 2025, 4:53 \nPM), https://x.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1953560188461654357.  \nPage 12 of 13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 104   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/07/2025   Page 13 of 13\nthe  activities  specified  above,  any  contractors,  subcontractors,  or  any  other \nindividuals or entities authorized to conduct work on the TNT site.

The Court \nwill also address Defendant Kevin Guthrie (the “State”) and Defendants Kristi Noem and \nTodd Lyons’ (together, “Federal Defendants”) venue challenges. (DE 50; DE 60; DE \n65).1 Both Motions are fully briefed.2 On July 30, 2025, the Parties presented oral \nargument on the State and Federal Defendants’ improper venue challenge, (DE 72) \n(“Hearing on Venue”), and on August 6, 7, 12, and 13, 2025, the Parties presented \nevidence and oral argument on the merits of Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.  \n \n1 Though Defendants’ venue challenges were advanced in the form of supplemental \nbriefings  to  Plaintiffs’  Renewed  Motion  for  TRO,  the  Court  “will  treat  Defendants’ \nresponse[s] as a 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss based on ‘improper venue.’” Doe 1 v. Bondi, \n-- F. Supp. 3d --, 2025 WL 1482733, at *4 (N.D. Ga. May 2, 2025).  \n2 All Defendants responded in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \n(DE 12; DE 16; DE 21), and Plaintiffs replied (DE 24). Plaintiffs also replied to Defendants’ \nimproper venue Motions. (DE 61; DE 66). \nPage 1 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 2 of 82\n(DE 102; DE 103; DE 119; DE 121 (together, the “Preliminary Injunction Hearing”)). \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that venue in the Southern District of \nFlorida (“S.D. Fla.”) is proper as to the State and Federal Defendants, and the Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction (DE 5) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. \nI.  BACKGROUND  \nAccording to the Complaint, on June 23, 2025, the Florida Division of Emergency \nManagement (“FDEM”) took control of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport \n(“TNT”), in order to construct a mass migrant detention and deportation camp. (DE 1 ¶¶ \n1, 39).3 Two days later, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that the detention \ncenter was requested and would be fully funded by the federal government. (Id. ¶ 35). \nPre-construction and construction activities at TNT began that week, (Id. ¶¶ 40–42), \naccording to Plaintiffs, without any environmental assessment or impact statement having \nbeen prepared. (Id. ¶ 43).  \nThe TNT site is located within the Big Cypress National Preserve (“BCNP”) and \nthe Big Cypress Area, which the Florida legislature has designated as “an area of critical \nstate concern” with the intention to “conserve and protect the [area’s] natural resources \nand scenic beauty.” Fla. Stat. § 380.055(1)–(2); (DE 1 ¶¶ 21–22). The project site is \n“within  an  environmentally  sensitive  freshwater  wetland  ecosystem  of  ecological \nsignificance for wildlife,” such as the “threatened wood stork, and the endangered Florida \nbonneted bat and the Florida panther.” (DE 1 ¶ 23). The site is also “near Everglades \nNational Park and part of the historic Everglades,” and within the footprint of the Western \n \n3 Throughout this Order, the Court will refer to the detention facility at the TNT site as \n“facility” or “camp.” The Court declines to use the moniker “Alligator Alcatraz.” \nPage 2 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 3 of 82\nEverglades Restoration Plan (“WERP”). (Id. ¶¶ 29, 32). The WERP is part of a multi-billion \ndollar joint federal-state effort to “restor[e], preserv[e], and “protect[] the South Florida \necosystem,” and uses a complex network of active and passive water management \nfeatures to “re-establish ecological connectivity, reduce the severity and frequency of \nwildfires, and restore low nutrient conditions” in the Western Everglades. (Id. ¶¶ 29–32). \nAccording to Plaintiffs, the detention camp’s construction and operation risks harming the \nwetlands, wildlife, aquifer, and air and water quality in this sensitive area, and degrading \nthe “natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral, and faunal, and recreational values for which the \nPreserve was created.” (Id. ¶ 58).   \nOn June 27, 2025, non-profit environmental organizations Friends and CBD filed \nthis suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the camp’s construction and \noperation until the project complied with federal, state, and local laws. (Id. ¶¶ 1, 8, 13). \nMost notably, Plaintiffs claim the project is being built and operated in violation of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), which requires that major federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the human environment undergo environmental review processes. \n(Id. ¶¶ 61–74) (Count I). Because no such review had been done, Plaintiffs claim, the \napproval and use of the camp by the United States Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”),  including  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  (“ICE”),  should  be  held \nunlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). (Id. ¶¶ 75–79) (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701 et seq.) (Count II). Plaintiffs further claim the State’s participation in the project \nthrough FDEM exceeds the department’s authority under Florida Statutes Chapters 252 \nand 944. (Id. ¶¶ 80–87) (Count III). Finally, Plaintiffs allege Defendant Miami-Dade County \n(“Miami-Dade”) unlawfully acquiesced in allowing its property, TNT, to be used as a \nPage 3 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 4 of 82\ndetention camp without the proper permitting and in violation of county code. (Id. ¶¶ 88–\n94) (Count IV). The case was initially assigned to another judge in this district. (DE 2).  \nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction (DE 5), \nrequesting that the Court enjoin the State and the Federal Defendants from developing \nor using the TNT site as an immigration detention camp “unless and until Defendants \ncomply with NEPA and the APA.” (DE 5 at 1–2, 14).4 Within the following week, all \nDefendants responded, challenging Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, (DE 12; \nDE 16; DE 21), inter alia, and Plaintiffs replied. (DE 24). No Defendant raised venue as \nan issue. \nThe State’s response included an affidavit from Keith Pruett, the FDEM Deputy \nExecutive Director, stating that Florida is funding the project, though it expects to seek \nreimbursement from the federal government, and that the project’s environmental impact \nis likely to be minimal,5 as TNT was already an active airfield with two buildings on site lit \n \n4 In their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs also requested that the Court enjoin \nthe State and Federal Defendants “from authorizing or permitting further development or \nuse of the TNT [s]ite for purposes related to a noncitizen detention center,” regardless of \nwhat procedures they follow. (DE 5 at 14). That request is apparently tied to Count III, \nwhich challenges the FDEM’s authority to build and operate a correctional camp. (DE 1 \n¶¶ 82–85). However, Plaintiffs did not develop any arguments nor provide any evidence \nrelated to Count III in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, their subsequent briefing, or \nduring the Preliminary Injunction Hearing. Therefore, Plaintiffs have waived this request. \nSee Fernandez v. Hotwire Commc’ns, Ltd., No. 21-cv-60115, 2022 WL 4598638, at *17 \n(S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2022) (holding plaintiffs had waived their disparate impact theory by \nfailing to advance any arguments on the issue at summary judgment (citing United States \nv. Campbell, 26 F.4th 860, 873 (11th Cir. 2022) (holding that the “failure to raise an issue \nin an initial brief . . . should be treated as a forfeiture of the issue”)). Similarly, Plaintiffs \ninitially  sought  injunctive  relief  against  Miami-Dade  but  subsequently  withdrew  that \nrequest. (DE 31 at 3 n.2). Consequently, the Court considers only Plaintiffs’ request for \nan injunction tied to their NEPA allegations.  \n5 Director Pruett’s declaration provided no background regarding his education, prior work \nexperience, or familiarity with environmental sciences, the Everglades ecosystem, or \nNEPA. (DE 16-1 at 2–3). It is entirely unclear in what capacity Director Pruett purports to \nPage 4 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 5 of 82\n24-hours a day. (DE 16-1). For their part, the Federal Defendants attached declarations \nfrom Thomas Giles, Acting Deputy Executive Associate Director for ICE’s Enforcement \nand Removal Operations (“ERO”), (DE 21-1), and David Richardson, acting Administrator \nof the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”). (DE 21-2).6 Giles stated that \nICE’s role in the development of the detention camp has been “limited to touring the camp \nto ensure compliance with ICE detention standards, and meeting with officials from the \nState of Florida to discuss operational matters.” (DE 21-1 ¶ 5). He further declared Florida \nwould have final decision-making authority over who to detain at the camp, but that any \ndetentions at the camp would be pursuant to “section 287(g) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act [(“INA”)], codified at 8 U.S.C § 1357(g).” (Id. ¶¶ 6–7). Even so, Richardson \nadmitted  that  the  facility  would  be  funded  by  the  federal  government,  stating  that \n“DHS/FEMA announced $600 million in federal funding for the Detention Support Grant \nProgram [(“DSGP”)]” and that “[t]he only eligible applicant under the DSGP is [FDEM].” \n(DE 21-2 ¶ 3).  \nOver the next two weeks through July 16, 2025, the Parties filed notices with \nadditional affidavits and other evidence, and they made additional arguments on the \nmerits of Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction request. See (DE 14; DE 20; DE 25; DE 26;  \nDE 27; DE 34; DE 35; DE 38; DE 47; DE 48). This included two filings by the State, which, \nin part, reiterated its merits argument that “NEPA does not apply” to the TNT camp.  \n \npossess the knowledge required to determine the likely environmental impacts of a \ndetention center on the Everglades.  \n6 Throughout this Order, the Court will identify exhibits either through reference to their \ndocket entry numbers or their exhibit numbers on the Parties’ Final Lists of Admitted \nExhibits (DE 123; DE 124). When doing the latter, Plaintiffs’ exhibits will be identified as \n“Pl. Ex. #”, the Tribe’s exhibits as “Tribe Ex. #”, and Defendants’ exhibits as “D. Ex. #”. \nPage 5 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 6 of 82\n(DE 28 at 2; DE 35 at 1 (“No matter how many times Plaintiffs poke and prod at the Court, \nthey  are  unable  to  show  their  complaint  presents  a  justiciable  controversy  under \nNEPA.”)). Still, no Defendant challenged or raised the question of venue.  \nAlso during that period, on July 14, 2025, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of \nFlorida (“Tribe”) moved to intervene as plaintiffs based on its long-standing ties to the \nlands around TNT and the environmental risks the project poses to the Tribe’s food and \nwater supply.7 (DE 33). Then on July 16, 2026, the presiding judge recused from the \ncase, and it was reassigned to the undersigned. (DE 37).  \nThe next day, Plaintiffs filed a Renewed Motion for TRO, explaining that since they \nfiled  suit,  the  “State  and  Federal  Defendants  commenced  transporting  immigration \ndetainees to the TNT [s]ite,” that, according to State officials, “as many as 900 people are \nnow being detained at the [s]ite, and that the State has plans to expand the number of \ndetainees to as many as 4,000.” (DE 40 at 2). Given the completion of the detention \ncamp’s first phase of construction and its ongoing operations, Plaintiffs modified their \nrequest for injunctive relief, now seeking a “halt to any further construction on the TNT \n[s]ite . . ., [a] pause[ to] the transport of additional detainees to the [s]ite, and [the] ceasing \n[of] any operations related to detaining or preparing for the detention of anyone not \n[already] detained at the [s]ite[.]” (Id. at 6).     \nOn July 21, 2025, the State filed a Supplemental Response to Plaintiffs’ Requests \nfor a Temporary Restraining Order (“Supplemental Response on Venue”) arguing for \n \n7 Only the State opposed the Tribe’s intervention in the suit. See (DE 58; DE 59). The \nCourt granted the Tribe’s request on July 30, 2025. (DE 73). The Tribe has since filed an \nIntervenor Complaint, (DE 84), and joined Friends and CBD’s Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction. (DE 85). \nPage 6 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 7 of 82\nthe first time that “venue is not proper in this Court.” (DE 50 at 1). At a Status Conference \nthat day, the Court set a briefing schedule on the issue and oral arguments for July 30, \n2025. (DE 54). ‘“Where facts are bitterly contested and credibility determinations must be \nmade to decide whether injunctive relief should issue,’ district courts must hold an \nevidentiary hearing on the propriety of injunctive relief.” Farmworker Ass’n of Fla. v. \nMoody, 734 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1320–21 (S.D. Fla. 2024) (quoting McDonald’s Corp. v. \nRobertson, 147 F.3d 1301, 1312 (11th Cir. 1998). Therefore, the Court also set an \nevidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction for August 6, 2025.  \n(DE 54). \nA. Preliminary Injunction Hearing  \nOver four days of evidentiary presentation and oral argument between August 6 \nand August 13, 2025, the Court heard testimony from ten witnesses and viewed over a \nhundred exhibits. Plaintiffs first called Friends Executive Director Eve Samples, who \nspoke  both  of  her  personal,  and  the  50,000-member  organization’s  commitment  to \npreserving the Everglades and the procedural harms they have faced due to Defendants’ \nfailure to consult with Friends before building the detention camp. State Representative \nAnna Eskamani recounted a July 12, 2025 tour of the facility led by Director Guthrie. She \ntestified that on the tour, Director Guthrie informed her that the facility was the product of \na DHS request, that there would be a federal reimbursement to the state for the facility’s \ncosts, that detainees are dropped off at the site by federal agents, and that ICE inspects \nthe facility. CBD member Amber Crooks described hiking, camping, stargazing, and \nanimal-watching in the preserved areas around the TNT site, shared her fears that the \nlight pollution, increased traffic, and wastewater associated with the project will frustrate \nPage 7 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 8 of 82\nher future enjoyment of the area, and stated her readiness to engage with any future \nNEPA process. Next, 27-year veteran of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation \nCommission, ecologist, and panther expert Randy Kautz explained how increased light, \nsound, vehicular traffic, and other human activity from the project risks loss of habitat and \nincreased mortality for the estimated 120 to 230 remaining Florida panthers. The final \nwitness on August 6 was Friends member Jessica Namath, an avid outdoorswoman and \nanimal watcher, who described regularly hiking and driving in the areas surrounding the \nTNT site before the camp’s construction. Since then, Ms. Namath testified to spending \nnearly every day at the access gate to the TNT site to bear witness to its transformation. \nShe described the site’s industrial lighting and her observation of heavy construction \nmaterials and machinery coming and going to and from the site, and of federal law \nenforcement vehicles entering the site daily.  \nOn August 7, Plaintiffs called soil physicist, hydrologist, and wetland ecologist Dr. \nChristopher McVoy. After touring the project with site Incident Commander Dr. Frank E. \nLumm, and reviewing photos and soil reports, Dr. McVoy opined that over 800,000 square \nfeet of new paving had been introduced at the site, which risked disrupting the nutrient \nbalance of the surrounding, connected wetlands by increasing runoff. Next, former Miami-\nDade County Department of Environmental Regulatory Management geologist Dillon \nReio presented an analysis concluding that the Defendants’ 800,000 square feet of new \npaving could lead to large increases in runoff contaminated with polycyclic aromatic \nhydrocarbons (“PAH”) and other carcinogens into the surrounding wetlands. He also \ntestified that the project did not appear to have any meaningful stormwater management \nsystem, based on his review of permitting databases and the camp’s engineering plans.  \nPage 8 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 9 of 82\nOn August 12, the Tribe called two members of its environmental team, Director \nof  Water  Resources  Amy  Castaneda  and  Fish  and  Wildlife  Department  Director  \nDr. Marcel Bozas.8 Castaneda testified that eighty percent of the Tribe’s residences, two \nschools, and the Tribal governmental building, are all located in the Miccosukee Reserved \nArea a few miles southeast of the TNT site in Miami-Dade County. She explained that \nany uncontained wastewater or run-off leaving the TNT site will likely flow into the BCNP, \nEverglades National Park, and eventually into the Miccosukee Reserved Area. She \nfurther testified that the multi-billion-dollar water management projects associated with \nthe  recently  enacted  WERP—which  was  the  culmination  of  an  almost  decade-long \nplanning—were based on the TNT site’s old usage as a training airport, and that WERP’s \npreservation  efforts  in  the  area  could  be  hindered  by  high-nutrient  runoff  from  the \ndetention camp. Dr. Bozas testified about the site’s current and potential harmful impacts \non the environment and the Tribe’s use of the lands. He testified about the Tribe’s \ntraditions of hunting, fishing, and collection of medicinal or other culturally important plants \naround the site. He pointed out off-road trails with trailheads on the camp’s fence line, \nwhich had served as the Tribe’s access points to BCNP and which are now inaccessible. \nHe also discussed how the increased human activity, traffic, noise, and light from the \nproject is likely to disrupt wildlife in the area, including the endangered panther, bonneted \nbat, and wood stork.  \nThe only witness called by Defendants was Florida Department of Highway Safety \n \n8 Castaneda earned a bachelor’s degree of science in natural resource conservation and \nhas worked in the Tribe’s Water Resources Division for nineteen years. (DE 129 at 12). \nDr. Bozas holds a Ph.D. in earth system science and natural resources and conducted a \nstudy for his dissertation of wildlife movement in the Miccosukee Water Conservation \nArea and Everglades National Park. (Id. at 96–97). \nPage 9 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 10 of 82\nand Motor Vehicles (“FDHSMV”) Executive Director David Kerner. Director Kerner, who \nalso oversees the Florida Highway Patrol (“FHP”), discussed FHP’s coordination with ICE \nunder their 287(g) agreement. He explained how FHP troopers contact ICE to make a \ndetention determination after stopping an individual on state law violations and then \nsuspecting that individual of lacking lawful status. He said that it is federal agencies and \nagents, not FHP troopers, who transport detainees to the TNT site, and federal agencies \nwho carry out deportations using federal aircraft. Director Kerner also discussed the \nimportance of immigration enforcement in Florida generally, referencing an uptick in \nhuman and narcotics trafficking across the border, and the importance of increasing \ndetention  capacity  to  those  enforcement  priorities.  Director  Kerner  testified  that  his \nknowledge of who was being detained at the TNT site was limited, though he knew all \ndetainees were there solely on immigration violations, none on state criminal charges. \nFinally, Director Kerner said he had been on a tour of the facility before it became \noperational and that he was not aware of any other sites that had been considered for the \nfacility. Defendants also introduced evidence that the TNT site had been in active use as \na training airport for decades before the project, and questioned witnesses about how risk \nof harms from its use as a detention camp compare to those of its prior use facilitating \ntraining flights. And throughout the Hearing, Defendants cross-examined witnesses about \ntheir failure to collect data proving that the detention camp was having the harmful effects \nthey described in their testimony. \nAlthough the Court heard testimony into the early evening of August 6, the Parties \nagreed the Preliminary Injunction Hearing would not conclude that day. At that time, \ncounsel for the State and Federal Defendants informed the Court that they had absolute \nPage 10 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 11 of 82\nscheduling  conflicts  which  would  preclude  resumption  of  the  proceedings  until  the \nfollowing Tuesday. After some discussion with the Court, the Parties agreed that the \nHearing could proceed the next day for just a half day, to be resumed the following \nTuesday.  \nAt the close of the half day of testimony on August 7, Plaintiffs renewed their \nrequest for a limited TRO, citing evidence suggesting that Defendants planned to add \npaving and other infrastructure over the weekend, while the Hearing was in recess. \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs requested that the Court prevent any additional industrial-style \nlighting, paving, filling, excavating, site preparation, or fencing from being introduced to \nthe  site.  The  Court  inquired  as  to  whether  Defendants  would  agree  that  no  such \nconstruction would take place over the five-day hiatus. Defendants were unwilling to make \nthis representation. Consequently, after hearing additional argument, the Court granted \nPlaintiffs’ narrow request for a TRO, halting further expansion of the site for fourteen days. \n(DE 104). The Court then concluded the evidentiary presentation on August 12, 2025, \nand heard closing remarks the following day. \nB. 287(g) Agreements \n“For nearly 150 years, the Supreme Court has held that the power to control \nimmigration—the entry, admission, and removal of noncitizens—is exclusively a federal \npower.” United States v. Texas, 97 F.4th 268, 278–79 (5th Cir. 2024). However, “[f]ederal \nlaw specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may perform the functions of \nan immigration officer[,]” such as through a formal agreement under § 1357(g)(1). Arizona \nv.  United  States,  567  U.S.  387,  408–09  (2012).  As  mentioned  above,  the  Federal \nDefendants concede that the camp operates pursuant to such “287(g)” agreements \nPage 11 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 12 of 82\nbetween DHS (through ICE) and relevant Florida law enforcement agencies, along with \nthe aid of on-site federal agents. (DE 105 at 34). In a separate case raising constitutional \nchallenges  to  particular  practices  at  the  camp,  the  State  and  Federal  Defendants \nproduced several of the operative 287(g) agreements, including those between ICE and \nnine Florida agencies: Florida Department of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco Bureau \nof Law Enforcement (“FDABT”); Florida Department of Corrections (“FDOC”); Florida \nDepartment of Law Enforcement (“FDLE”); Florida Department of Financial Services \nCriminal  Investigations  Division  (“DFS”);  FDHSMV,  Division  of  FHP;  Florida  Fish  & \nWildlife Conservation Commission (“FWC”) (DE 53-1 at 78), Florida Department of Lottery \nDivision of Security (“FDL”), the Florida National Guard (“FNG”), and Florida Department \nof Environmental Protection Division of Law Enforcement (“FDEP”). C.M. v. Noem,  \n25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 53-1 at 2, 17, 32, 47, 62, 78, 93, 108, 123 (collectively, the \n“287(g)  Agreements”).9  Each  of  those  agreements  contains  essentially  identical \nsections, titled “Ice Supervision” and “Liability and Responsibility”. Id. at 6–9, 19–20, 29, \n36–39, 51–54, 67–70, 82–85, 97–100, 112–15, 127–30. Those sections include the \nfollowing language:  \nXI. ICE SUPERVISION  \n \nImmigration enforcement activities conducted by participating LEA personnel will \nbe supervised and directed by ICE. Participating LEA personnel are not authorized \n \n9 “A district court may take judicial notice of public records within its files relating to the \nparticular case before it or other related cases.” Cash Inn of Dade, Inc. v. Metro. Dade \nCnty., 938 F.2d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir. 1991); see also Lockett v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., \n2021 WL 4815898, at *1, *12 n.9 (N.D. Ga.

Aug. 29, 2024) (explaining contract \nwas not hearsay because its language was legally operative, not used to prove the truth \nof another matter).  \nPage 12 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 13 of 82\nto  perform  immigration  officer  functions  except  when  working  under  the \nsupervision or direction of ICE.  \n \nFor the purposes of this MOA, ICE officers will provide supervision of participating \nLEA personnel only as to immigration enforcement functions. The LEA retains \nsupervision of all other aspects of the employment of and performance of duties \nby participating LEA personnel.  \n \nIn the absence of a written agreement to the contrary, the policies and procedures \nto be utilized by the participating LEA personnel in exercising these authorities \nshall be DHS and ICE policies and procedures, including the ICE Use of Force \nPolicy.  \n \nXIV. LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY  \n \nParticipating LEA personnel will be treated as Federal employees for purposes of \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(l), 2671-2680, and worker's \ncompensation claims, 5 U.S.C. § 8101 et seq., when performing a function on \nbehalf of ICE as authorized by this MOA. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(7); 28 U.S.C. § \n2671. In addition, it is the understanding of the parties to this MOA that \nparticipating  LEA  personnel  performing  a  function  on  behalf  of  ICE \nauthorized by this MOA will be considered acting under color of federal \nauthority for purposes of determining liability and immunity from suit under \nfederal or state law. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(8). \n  \nThese provisions are replete with express references to the statutory framework \nthat governs 287(g) agreements. Section 1357(g) allows states or localities to enter into \nagreements with the Attorney General to deputize state or local officers to perform \nfunctions of federal immigration officers when they are “determined by the Attorney \nGeneral to be qualified to perform” those functions after receiving training and certification \n“regarding the enforcement of relevant Federal immigration laws.” § 1357(g)(1)–(2). \nWhen acting under a 287(g) agreement, the deputized officer “shall be subject to the \ndirection and supervision of the Attorney General.” § 1357(g)(3). Further, any 287(g) \nagreement  must  specify  the  deputized  officer’s  powers  and  duties,  the  duration  of \ndelegated authority, and the federal agency official who is “required to supervise and \ndirect the individual[.]” § 1357(g)(5). Finally, the deputized officer is treated as a federal \nPage 13 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 14 of 82\nemployee for purposes of compensation for injury and tort liability, and the officer “shall \nbe considered to be acting under color of Federal authority for purposes of determining \nthe liability, and immunity from suit[.]” § 1357(g)(7)–(8).   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \n“Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3), a party may assert the defense \nof improper venue.” Hemispherx Biopharma, Inc. v. MidSouth Capital, Inc., 669 F. Supp. \n2d 1353, 1356 (S.D. Fla. 2009). When a defendant does, “the plaintiff bears the burden \nof showing that the venue selected is proper.” Id. (citing Delong Equip. Co. v. Wash. Mills \nAbrasive Co., 840 F.2d 843, 845 (11th Cir. 1988)); Wai v. Rainbow Holdings, 315 F. Supp. \n2d 1261, 1268 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (“On a motion to dismiss based on improper venue, the \nplaintiff has the burden of showing that venue in the forum is proper.”). A court “must \naccept all allegations of the complaint as true, unless contradicted by the defendants’ \nevidence, and the court “may examine facts outside of the complaint” when factual \ndisputes arise. Id. (citations omitted). In reviewing the allegations and evidence, “the court \nmust draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all factual conflicts in favor of the \nplaintiff.” Hemispherx, 669 F. Supp. 2d at 1356; see also Home Ins. Co. v. Thomas Indus., \nInc., 896 F.2d 1352, 1355 (11th Cir. 1990) (when reviewing a Rule 12(b)(3) motion and \nthe parties’ “affidavits conflict, the court is inclined to give greater weight to the plaintiff’s \nversion of the jurisdictional facts and to construe such facts in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff.”). Finally, “venue must be proper as to each defendant and each claim.”  \nDoe 1 v. Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary, No. 23-cv-5294, 2024 WL \n4276174, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.

Gasch, 511 F.2d 804, 807 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1975)).        \nEven if venue is proper, a court may transfer a case to another district in which \nvenue lies “in the interest of justice.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404. The court should consider \n“convenience of parties and witnesses, the ‘locus of operative facts,’ and other concerns \nrelated to ‘trial efficiency[.]’” Bryant v. Sheriff, Saint Lucie Cnty., Fla., 2024 WL 4458382, \nat *8 (11th Cir. Oct. 10, 2024) (quoting Manuel v. Convergys Corp., 430 F.3d 1132, 1135 \nn.1  (11th  Cir.  2005)).  Additionally,  the  court  should  weigh  “various  public-interest \nconsiderations,” including “the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion; \nthe local interest in having localized controversies decided at home; [and] the interest in \nhaving the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the law.” Atl. Marine \nConstr. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the W. Dist. of Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 62 n.6 (2013) (internal \nquotations omitted). \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes courts to grant a \npreliminary injunction before final judgment in limited circumstances. The purpose of this \ninjunctive relief is to “preserve the status quo until the district court renders a meaningful \ndecision on the merits.” Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th \nCir. 2005) (citation omitted). To merit a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show:  \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the preliminary \ninjunction is necessary to prevent irreparable injury; (3) that the threatened \ninjury outweighs the harm the preliminary injunction would cause the other \nlitigant; and (4) that the preliminary injunction would not be averse to the \npublic interest. \n \nGissendaner v. Comm’r, Ga. Dep’t of Corr., 779 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting \nWellons  v.  Comm’r,  Ga.

Amazon.com, Inc., 840 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2016) \n(internal quotations omitted).  \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nDefendants levy several objections to the propriety of the Court’s adjudication of \nthis matter. First, Defendants argue that 8 U.S.C. 1252(a) and (f) strip the Court of subject-\nmatter  jurisdiction  over  any  aspect  of  Plaintiffs’  NEPA  claim  that  relates  to  federal \nimmigration detention activities. (DE 16 at 12; DE 21 at 5–6). Next, Defendants contest \nwhether the S.D. Fla. is the proper district for Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Guthrie \nand the  Federal  Defendants.  The  Court  will  address  these  threshold  issues  before \ndiscussing the merits of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.10  \n \n10  Although  Defendants  do  not  contest  Plaintiffs’  standing,  a  “district  court  [is]  not \nempowered to reach any merits question” without first establishing its jurisdiction. See \nWiand v. ATC Brokers Ltd., 96 F.4th 1303, 1311 (11th Cir. 2024). So, the Court will briefly \naddress Plaintiffs’ standing to seek injunctive relief. Plaintiffs may establish standing \nthrough either their own injury in fact or through associational standing by virtue of injuries \nposed to or suffered by their members. City of S. Mia. v. Governor, 65 F.4th 631, 637 \n(11th Cir. 2023). “To establish associational standing, an organization must prove that its \nmembers ‘would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right.’” Jacobson v. Fla. \nSec’y of State, 974 F.3d 1236, 1249 (11th Cir. 2020) (citations omitted). To this end, \nPlaintiffs must “make specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member \nhad suffered or would suffer harm.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498 \n(2009). Here, Plaintiffs allege (and have supported through evidence) that their members’ \naesthetic,  conservational,  and  recreational  interests  are  adversely  impacted  by  the \ndetention camp’s operations. From light pollution affecting members’ ability to observe \nthe night skies, to noise pollution impacting members’ ability to observe and interact with \nwildlife, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the injuries to their members \nand, therefore, have established associational standing. See Ouachita Watch League v. \nJacobs, 463 F.3d 1163, 1170–73 (11th Cir. 2006) (plaintiff environmental groups “easily” \nhad associational standing when alleging that an agency “shirked its duties under NEPA \n. . ., with the result that already vulnerable species and their habitats are now more \nvulnerable,” and the group’s members use the area to recreate and engage with the \nenvironment).  \n \nPage 16 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 17 of 82\nA. Section 1252 does not strip the Court of subject-matter jurisdiction over this \nNEPA claim.  \n \n1.  Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  \nSection 1252(a)(2)(b)(ii) provides that “[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review . \n. . any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity the authority for which is specified under this subsection to be in the discretion \nof the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security[.]” The statute “precludes \n[the Court’s] review of discretionary decisions of the [Secretary] in only th[os]e specific \ncircumstances.” Zafar v. United States Attorney General, 461 F.3d 1357, 1360 (11th Cir. \n2006) (emphasis in original); see also Bakran v. Sec’y United States Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 894 F.3d 557, 562 (3d Cir. 2018) (“The INA’s jurisdiction-stripping language . . . \napplies not to all decisions the [Secretary] is entitled to make, but to a narrower category \nof decisions where Congress has taken the additional step to specify that the sole \nauthority for the action is in the [Secretary]’s decision.”) (citations and quotations omitted). \n“The statute requires us to look at the particular decision being made and to ascertain \nwhether  that  decision  is  one  that  Congress  has  designated  to  be  discretionary.”  \nMejia Rodriguez v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 562 F.3d 1137, 1143 (11th Cir. \n2009) (emphasis in original).  \nAs the Eleventh Circuit has clarified, “[t]he phrase ‘specified under this subchapter’ \nrefers to subchapter II of Chapter 12, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151–1378.” Zafar, 461 F.3d at 1360. \n“Thus, to avoid judicial review, the [government] must rely on an explicit, Congressionally-\ndefined, discretionary statutory power . . . articulated within sections 1151 through 1378[.]” \nBelegradek v. Gonzales, 523 F. Supp. 2d 1364, 1367 (N.D. Ga. 2007) (emphasis in \noriginal; citation and quotations omitted). \nPage 17 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 18 of 82\nDefendants rely on §§ 1226 and 1231, which address the Attorney General’s \nauthority to detain and remove noncitizens. However, Plaintiffs challenge neither the fact \nnor the manner of detention or removal. Rather, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief compelling \nDefendants to comply with NEPA, which ensures “federal agencies . . . adequately assess \nthe environmental impacts of actions they undertake.” City of Oxford, Ga. v. F.A.A., 428 \nF.3d 1346, 1352 (11th Cir. 2005). This relief does not implicate, much less interfere with, \nany decision “specified . . . to be in the discretion” of the Secretary or the Attorney \nGeneral. Because NEPA compliance is not a decision specified to be in the discretion of \nthe Attorney General or Secretary, § 1252(a)(2)(b)(ii) simply does not apply. Defendants \nconflate two very distinct types of relief. An injunction requiring NEPA compliance would, \nat most, prevent the use of the facility until a lawful NEPA review is done. This is not the \nsame thing as the Court dictating where or how the government must house immigration \ndetainees, which Congress has specified to be within the Secretary’s discretion. Plaintiffs \nseek only the former type of relief.11 \nDefendants’  cited  cases—nearly  all  of  which  feature  individual  plaintiffs \nchallenging  their  own  detentions  or  removals—confirm  this  distinction.  Defendants \nselectively quote language from these cases to suggest that § 1252(a)(2)(b)(ii) is broader \nthan it is. Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Attorney General and Secretary possess \nauthority over detention and removal as those cases recognize. But those decisions arose \nin entirely different factual and legal contexts. None address NEPA, none involve the \n \n11 In C.M. v. Noem, the court drew a similar conclusion when analyzing whether another \njurisdiction-stripping provision of the INA, § 1252(g), precluded review of claims by \ndetainees at the TNT site alleging the manner of their detentions unduly restricted their \naccess to counsel. 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 86 at 31–32; see also infra n.14. \nPage 18 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 19 of 82\nAPA, and none interpret § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) in a way that would bar review of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims. See, e.g., Sinclair v. Att’y Gen. of United States, 198 F.

Wiersum v. U.S. \nBank, N.A., 785 F.3d 483, 488 (11th Cir. 2015) (“As the Supreme Court has instructed \ntime again, courts presume Congress says in a statute what it means and means in a \nstatute what it says there.”) (citations and quotations omitted); Harris v. Garner, 216 F.3d \n970, 976 (11th Cir. 2000) (“We will not do to the statutory language what Congress did \nnot do with it, because the role of the judicial branch is to apply statutory language, not to \nrewrite it.”) (citations omitted).  \n2.  Section 1252(f)(1)  \nDefendants also rely on § 1252(f)(1), which provides that “no court (other than the \nSupreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of \nthe provisions of part IV of this subchapter.” In other words, “[i]t prohibits federal courts \nfrom granting classwide injunctive relief” against certain provisions of the INA, specifically \n§§ 1221–1231. Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482 \n(1999); see also Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. 543, 550 (2022) (“§ 1252(f)(1) \ngenerally prohibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order federal officials to take \nor to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified \nstatutory  provisions.”).  “Those  provisions  charge  the  Federal  Government  with  the \nimplementation  and  enforcement  of  the  immigration  laws  governing  the  inspection, \napprehension, examination, and removal of aliens.” Id. at 549–50. \nHere, Plaintiffs’ requested relief does not fall within that bar. They do not seek to \nhalt, suspend, or alter the “operation” of any INA provision, nor do they challenge the \nDefendants’ authority to implement or enforce immigration laws. An order compelling \nNEPA compliance does not “enjoin or restrain” immigration operations; it simply requires \nPage 20 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 21 of 82\nDefendants  to  follow  the  environmental  procedures  that  Congress  imposed.  \nSee generally Fla. Wildlife Fed’n v. United States Army Corps of Eng’rs, 401 F. Supp. 3d \n1298, 1309 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (“NEPA establishes important action-forcing procedures to \nensure that the broad national commitment to protecting and promoting environmental \nquality is infused into the actions of the federal government.”) (citations and quotations \nomitted). Thus, to the extent Defendants argue otherwise based on detention decisions \nunder  §  1226,  that  reliance  is  misplaced.  Plaintiffs  do  not  challenge  any  detention \ndecision, and § 1226 contains no language suggesting that NEPA compliance is shielded \nfrom judicial review. “Congress legislated which sections are covered by § 1252(f)(1). The \nExecutive Branch does not get to propose additions.” Texas v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 123 F.4th 186, 210 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nAnd if NEPA compliance has a “collateral effect” on immigration operations, that is \ninsufficient to trigger § 1252(f)(1). Id. at 209 (“[A] court may enjoin the unlawful operation \nof  a  provision that  is  not  specified  in §  1252(f)(1) even  if  that  injunction  has  some \ncollateral effect on the operation of a covered provision.”) (emphasis in original; citation \nomitted); see also United Farm Workers v. Noem, -- F. Supp. 3d -- 2025 WL 1235525, at \n*22 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2025) (“Courts maintain authority to enter injunctions addressing \nother provisions of the INA even if there may be collateral effects upon a provision \ncovered by Section 1252(f)(1) . . . . Thus, even if an injunction could have a collateral \neffect on the provisions identified by Defendants, the Court has the jurisdiction and the \nauthority to issue an injunction.”). Therefore, neither § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) nor § 1252(f)(1) \ndeprive the Court of jurisdiction to require Defendants’ compliance with NEPA.  \n \nPage 21 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 22 of 82\nB. The Southern District of Florida is the appropriate venue for this suit. \nNext, the State and Federal Defendants each argue that venue in the S.D. Fla. is \nimproper.12 (DE 50 at 1; DE 60 at 1). Plaintiffs assert that the State waived its venue \nchallenge. Plaintiffs go on to argue that regardless, venue in the S.D. Fla. is proper as to \nthe Federal Defendants under § 1391(e)(1)(B) and § 1391(e)(1)(C), (DE 66 at 3), and is \nproper as to the State under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). (DE 61 at 8). The Court will address \neach issue in turn.  \n1.  Waiver \nPlaintiffs initially argue that the State waived any venue challenge by litigating this \ncase on the merits for almost a month—including filing three merits briefs in opposition to \nPlaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief—before raising venue. (DE 16; DE 28; DE 35).  \n“A party waives [improper venue] by . . . failing to . . . include it in a responsible pleading \nor in an amendment allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(h)(1)(B)(ii). It may also be waived by other “conduct amounting to waiver as a matter \nof law.” Manley v. Engram, 755 F.2d 1463, 1468 (11th Cir. 1985). “Because a motion to \ndismiss for lack of venue . . . can be raised so easily, [courts] strictly apply the waiver \nrule[.]” Manchester Knitted Fashions, Inc. v. Amalgamated Cotton Garment and Allied \nIndus. Fund, 967 F.2d 688, 692 (1st Cir. 1992) (describing Rule 12 as requiring venue to \nbe raised in a defendant’s “first defensive move” and affirming a finding of waiver when \ndefendant had requested a hearing on plaintiff’s TRO motion, moved to appear pro hac \nvice, and stipulated to expedited discovery and preliminary injunction hearing without \nraising venue). An “opposition to a motion for preliminary injunction can be such a ‘first \n \n12 Defendant Miami-Dade County has not challenged venue.  \nPage 22 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 23 of 82\nresponsive pleading’ or defensive move.” Bautista-Perez v. Holder, 681 F. Supp. 2d 1083, \n1091 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (venue was waived when defendants filed two opposition motions \nto plaintiff’s preliminary injunction request, including a declaration on the case’s merits).  \nHere, the State filed notices of appearance on the same day the Complaint was \nfiled. (DE 10; DE 11). Then, over the course of almost a month, the State filed three merits \nbriefs, including a declaration from FDEM Executive Director Guthrie. (DE 16; DE 28;  \nDE 35). The State also filed a motion for extension of time to respond to the Complaint in \norder to align its deadline with the Federal Defendants’, all without mentioning venue.  \n(DE 39). In short, the State failed to raise venue in any of its first three defensive moves, \ndespite the opportunity. This is sufficient for a finding of waiver.  \nThe State argues that the above cited cases are distinguishable because in those \ncases preliminary injunction hearings were held without mention of waiver. (DE 65 at 4–\n5). But none of those courts discuss that fact as relevant to their decisions. The State \nthen offers a series of inapposite cases where courts rejected waiver in completely \ndifferent scenarios to the one presented here. See Lithia Ramsey-T, LLC v. City Line Auto \nSales, LLC, No. 22-03592, 2023 WL 1883355, at *5 (D.N.J. Feb. 9, 2023) (personal \njurisdiction was not waived by complying with the court’s order to show cause and appear \nfor preliminary injunction hearing a week after complaint filed); Bartlett v.

Masselli, No. 2:07-cv-214, 2008 WL \n111057, at *3 (N.D. Ind. 2008) (rejecting waiver argument after defendant appeared at \nTRO hearing, briefed the non-merits issue of necessity of a security bond for the TRO,  \nand then raised venue in their first merits pleadings—their answer and a motion to \ndismiss); Friedberg v. Mut. Holdings, Ltd., No. 02-3193, 2005 WL 1213282, at *3 (E.D. \nPa. May 19, 2005) (defendants’ 12(b)(6) motion based on forum selection clause was not \nwaivable,  but  even  if  construed  as  a  12(b)(3)  motion,  no  waiver  when  defendants \nstipulated to TRO as a part of settlement negotiations and did not litigate on the merits).  \nIn sum, for a month, Defendants disregarded an issue they now describe as \nobviously correct, “an important issue,” and a “leading legal argument.” DE 89 at 13–14, \n16 (arguing “it would be impossible to say” venue is valid under 1391(e)(1)(C) and any \narguments for venue under 1391(b)(2) are “easily dispatched”). Though Defendants’ \nwaiver of venue is sufficient to foreclose venue as an issue, the Court addresses the \nmerits of all Defendants’ venue challenges, as both Parties requested. \n2.  Section 1391(e)(1)(C) \nWhen “a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency \nthereof” a civil action may “be brought in any judicial district in which . . . the plaintiff \nresides if no real property is involved in the action.” § 1391(e)(1)(C). For venue purposes, \na plaintiff entity resides “only in the judicial district in which it maintains its principal place \nof business[.]” § 1391(c)(2). Friends has its principal place of business in Stuart, FL, within \nthe S.D. Fla. (DE 61-1). The Federal Defendants do not dispute that this satisfies the first \nrequirement of § 1391(e)(1)(C). They argue that “Plaintiffs’ suit centers on the temporary \ndetention center, which is a collection of buildings and pavement on real property[,]” and \nPage 24 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 25 of 82\n“[t]hus, real property is a center component of this action[.]” (DE 60 at 4). But the Federal \nDefendants’ far-reaching interpretation runs counter to decades of authority and the \npurpose of § 1391(e), which is “to broaden the venue of civil actions” against federal \ndefendants. Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 490 n.4 (1971). As Judge Constance \nBaker Motley sagely wrote: \nGravity being what it is, the vast bulk of human activities take place on the face of \nthe earth. Consequently, almost any dispute over public or private decisions will in \nsome way “involve real property,” taken literally. The touchstone for applying § \n1391(e)(4) [(the prior, identical version of § 1391(e)(1)(C))] cannot sensibly be \nwhether real property is marginally affected by the case at issue. Rather, the action \nmust center directly on the real property, as with actions concerning the right, title \nor interest in real property. \n \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Tenn. Val. Auth., 340 F. Supp. 400, 406 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) \n(holding NEPA challenge to federally-owned utility’s practice of buying strip-mined coal \ndid not involve real property, despite the suit affecting “contracts with third-parties for \nproduction of coal,” because the plaintiffs did “not seek an adjudication of the validity of \ndefendants’ title, leases, or mineral rights”), rev’d on other grounds, 459 F.2d 255 (2d Cir. \n1972); see also Env. Defense Fund, Inc. v. Corps of Eng’rs of U.S. Army, 325 F. Supp. \n728,  732  (E.D.  Ark.  1971)  (NEPA  challenge  to  dam  project  met  prior  version  of                         \n§ 1391(e)(1)(C) because “[n]othing need[ed] to be done in [t]he action with respect to the \nreal estate under and adjacent to the [river] or upon which defendants contemplated[] \nconstructing the dam[, and] [t]he action d[id] not put in issue the title to, or possession of, \nsuch lands, or any interest therein”). \nOther courts nationwide have echoed Judge Motley’s statutory interpretation and \nheld that NEPA suits similar to Plaintiffs’ did not involve real property within the meaning \nof § 1391(e)(1)(C). For example, in Earth Island Institute v. Quinn, the court held real \nPage 25 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 26 of 82\nproperty was not involved in a NEPA challenge to a federal restoration project to “conduct \nsalvage harvest of fire-killed trees, remove hazardous trees, and engage in tree planting \nin areas affected by” recent fires. Earth Island Inst. v. Quinn, 56 F.Supp.3d 1110, 1112, \n1116 (N.D. Cal. 2014). The court began its analysis by pointing out that, “by using the \nlegal term ‘real property[]’ . . . Congress seems to have indicated that it intended mainly \nto cover disputes over legal interests in real property.” Id. at 1115–16. Indeed, the court \nfound, “[m]ost authority appears to have followed [Judge Motley’s] logic, generally finding \nthat  actions  ‘involve  real  property’  when  they  involve  disputes  over  real  property \ninterests—and perhaps not even then if the real property dispute is peripheral to the \ncentral cause of action.” Id. at 1116 (first citing Wright & Miller, 14D Fed. Prac. & Proc. \nJuris. § 3815 n.33 (4th ed.); and then Animal Legal Def. Fund v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric,  \nNo. 12-cv-4407, 2013 WL 120185, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 8, 2013)). Even though the case \nrelated to the use of “a specific area of land,” the court concluded this was insufficient to \nbring the suit within the category of real property disputes triggering the exception, as it \nwas more centrally a suit about “personal property interests in timber and regulatory and \nenvironmental policy issues.” Id. at 1116. \nNext,  in  Western  Watersheds  Project  v.  Schneider,  the  court  reaffirmed  its \ninterpretation of “§ 1391(e)(1)(C) to mean that ‘real property’ is not ‘involved’ in a lawsuit \nchallenging an agency’s compliance with NEPA[.]” W. Watersheds Project v. Schneider, \n2019 WL 4863483, at *2–3 (D. Id. Oct. 2, 2019) (citing WWP v. Salazar, No. 08-0516, \n2009 WL 1299626 (D. Id. May 7, 2009)). Before the court was a challenge to Bureau of \nLand Management (“BLM”) land-use plans in several western states, which Plaintiffs say \nunlawfully “relax[ed] restrictions on oil and gas development in sage grouse habitat.” Id. \nPage 26 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 27 of 82\nat *1. Though plaintiff’s suit implicated third-party property rights as an ancillary matter, \nplaintiffs were not disputing any party’s “right, title or interest in real property.” Id. at *3. \nInstead, the court held, like the court in Earth Island v. Quinn, that plaintiffs were merely \n“challeng[ing] an agency’s compliance with statutory mandates.” Id.  \nHere,  Plaintiffs’  suit  likewise  centers  on  non-compliance  with  “statutory \nmandates”—namely the Federal Defendants’ approval, construction, funding, and use of \nthe detention camp without conducting environmental analyses required by NEPA—not \nwho possesses any given property right to the TNT site. Therefore, even though the suit \ninvolves  real  property  in  a  colloquial  sense,  it  does  not  fit  within  the  meaning  of  \n§ 1391(e)(1)(C).  \nResisting this conclusion, Defendants point to a single case in which a court held \na suit under NEPA involved real property within § 1391(e)(1)(C). (DE 65 at 6 (citing Ctr. \nfor Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., No. 08-05646, 2009 WL 1025606, \n(N.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2009)); DE 89 at 10, 51 (same)). But that single authority relied on \nanother case in which “the plaintiff alleged that [BLM] improperly rejected [its] oil and gas \nlease applications.” Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 2009 WL 1025606, at *2 (citing Ferguson \nv. Lieurance, 565 F. Supp. 1013, 1015 (D. Nev. 1983)). In that distinguishable context—\nwhere “the obvious and undeniable purpose” of plaintiff’s action was to “acquire the real \nproperty interest he seeks”—the Ferguson court reasoned that the action did involve real \nproperty. Id. (quoting Ferguson, 565 F. Supp. at 1015). The Center for Biological Diversity \ncourt may have been swayed by the sheer “range of real property issues” at play in the \nchallenged plan before it, “including access to public and private lands, rights of way and \neasements across these lands, land withdrawals, and land exchanges and acquisitions.” \nPage 27 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 28 of 82\nId. at *1. Consequently, several courts have since found the Center for Biological Diversity \ncourt’s decision is confined to its facts and inapplicable in the NEPA context. See Earth \nIsland Inst. v. Nash, No. 19-cv-05792, 2019 WL 11023709, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2019) \n(finding Center for Biological Diversity “is distinguishable” from the case at hand, where \n“[p]laintiffs’ lawsuit certainly involves public land, [but] the claims focus on compliance \nwith NEPA and other environmental statutes”); W. Watersheds, 2019 WL 4863483, at *2 \n(finding Earth Island v. Quinn “more persuasive” than Center for Biological Diversity). This \nCourt does as well.13  \nTherefore, the Court finds that this suit does not involve real property within the \nmeaning of § 1391(e)(1)(C), and the S.D. Fla. is a proper venue for this suit with regard \nto the Federal Defendants under that subsection. The Court will now address whether \nthis district is a proper venue for the State and Federal Defendants as a locus of the \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to their claims.14  \n \n13 Finally, Defendants argue that even accepting the stricter interpretation of the phrase, \nthis  action  does  involve  real  property,  because  Count  IV  challenges  Miami-Dade’s \nacquiescence to the State’s use of the TNT site for the project. (DE 89 at 11, 49–52; DE \n65 at 6 (“[E]ven under Plaintiffs’ test, real property interests are involved: Plaintiffs allege \nDefendants wrongfully commandeered Miami-Dade’s property[.]”)). But again, Plaintiffs \nare not seeking to vindicate any property right of Miami-Dade’s or their own—they object \nto the site’s use as a detention camp in violation of certain procedural mandates. See (DE \n1 ¶ 93 (claiming “[Miami-Dade’s] agreement or acquiescence in allowing the TNT [s]ite \nfor use as a mas[s] detention center is in violation of the County code and permitting \nregimes”)).  \n14 Defendants filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (DE 128) citing an order in C.M. v. \nNoem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 86. The undersigned is aware that an esteemed \ncolleague recently issued this order in a separate litigation involving detainees housed at \nthe TNT facility. In that case, Plaintiffs raised First and Fifth Amendment constitutional \nchallenges to their conditions of confinement at the facility. As Defendants point out, the \norder recognizes the “distinct procedural posture” of this case in its discussion of venue, \nC.M., 25-cv-23182, ECF 86 at 33 n.14, although it should be noted that the Federal \nDefendants claim that venue was improper pursuant to § 1391(e) was resoundingly \nrejected in the C.M. order. Id. at 35–38. In any event, because, as acknowledged in that \nPage 28 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 29 of 82\n3.  Sections 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1)(B) \n“A civil action may [also] be brought in [any] judicial district in which a substantial \npart of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of \nproperty  that  is  the  subject  of  the  action  is  situated[.]”  §  1391(b)(2);  see  also  \n§ 1391(e)(1)(B) (providing transactional venue for federal defendants on the same basis). \nVenue is not confined to one district but may be proper “in two or more districts.” Jenkins \nBrick Co. v. Bremer, 321 F.3d 1366, 1371 (11th Cir. 2003). “Only the events that directly \ngive rise to a claim are relevant[,]” and “of the places where the events have taken place, \nonly those locations hosting a ‘substantial part’ of the events are to be considered.” Id.  \nHowever, the Court “is not required to weigh the events that occurred in” a plaintiff’s \nchosen district “against those that took place in” other districts and “choose which venue \nis more proper; rather, even though ‘a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to’ the claim” may have occurred in another district, “so long as the same can be said \nas to” a plaintiff’s chosen district, “venue is proper” there. Goodwyn, Mills & Canood, Inc. \nv. Black Swamp, Inc., 956 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1326 (M.D. Ala. 2012); see also Morgan v. \nN. MS Medical Ctr., Inc., 403 F. Supp. 2d 1115, 1123 (S.D. Ala. 2005) (“[A] plaintiff does \nnot have to select the venue with the most substantial nexus to the dispute, as long as \nshe chooses a venue where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim \noccurred.”).15 Further, ‘“[s]ubstantiality’ for venue purposes is more a qualitative than a \n \norder, the  legal and procedural  postures  of  the two  cases  are entirely distinct,  the \ndetermination as to venue in C.M. does not control or subvert the analysis here.   \n15 Therefore, it is irrelevant to the §1391(b)(2) analysis that the Middle District of Florida, \nwhere the majority of the detention camp is located, would also have been a proper venue \nfor Plaintiffs’ suit.  \nPage 29 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 30 of 82\nquantitative inquiry, determined by assessing the overall nature of the plaintiff’s claims \nand the nature of the specific events or omissions in the forum, and not by simply adding \nup the number of contacts.” Russo v.

Specifically, they point to: (1) TNT’s \npartial location in16 and ownership by Miami-Dade, (DE 61 at 9–10 (citing DE 12-3; DE \n12-4; DE 12-5)); (2) the State and Federal Defendants’ failure to conduct environmental \nassessments  and  provide  opportunity  for  notice  and  comment  regarding  the \nenvironmental impacts of the project, which would have taken place, in large part, in \nMiami-Dade, (id. at 10–11); and (3) the current and feared impacts of the project on \nMiami-Dade, its residents, threatened and endangered species within the county, and \nTribal sites and activities within Miami-Dade. (Id. at 13–15).  \n   Defendants argue that a substantial part of the events or omissions here could not \nhave taken place in the S.D. Fla. because “all the detention facilities, all the buildings, \nand all the paving at issue” are located in Collier County, in the Middle District of Florida \n(“M.D. Fla.”), and “all relevant decision[-]making was made or is being made by officials \nin Washington, DC; in Tallahassee, Florida; or onsite at the camp [.]” (DE 50 at 3–4); see \n \n16 Through dueling GIS maps and expert affidavits, the Parties aggressively dispute what \npercentage of the property is within Miami-Dade, 2% or 28%. (DE 79; DE 80; DE 86). It \ndoes appear that around 2% of the jetport is in Miami-Dade, while 28% of the total \ndeveloped and as yet undeveloped land is within Miami-Dade. The real disagreement is \nover which areas within the property are relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims and to what degree. \nBut, as will be explained, the answer to that question impacts venue little, so the Court \nwill not wade into this contestation. \nPage 30 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 31 of 82\nalso (DE 60 at 1). Defendants reject the notion that Miami-Dade’s ownership of the \nproperty has any relevance to the analysis, because, since “FDEM took control of the \n[s]ite . . . [Miami-Dade’s] activities . . . ‘do not have a close nexus with the cause of action.’” \n(DE 50 at 4–5 (quoting Jenkins Brick, 321 F.3d at 1373)). Finally, Defendants insist that \nonly Defendants’ actions, not Plaintiff’s injuries, should be taken into account. (DE 65 at \n9–11).  \nMuch of the dispute stems from the Parties’ disagreement over how Jenkins \nBrick—the Eleventh Circuit’s most detailed discussion of transactional venue—should be \nunderstood. The decision in Jenkins Brick arose from a dispute involving a breach of a \nnon-compete agreement between an Alabama-based company and a Georgia-based \nemployee. 321 F.3d at 1368. The contract had been executed in Georgia, was intended \nto  be  performed  in  Savannah,  Georgia  to  protect  the  Alabama-based  company’s \nemerging Georgia activities, and was breached when the Georgie employee was hired \nby a competitor in Savannah. Id. at 1372. Arguing that venue was nonetheless proper in \nAlabama, the plaintiff-employee noted that sales and training meetings had been held in \nAlabama, his salary and benefits came from Alabama, and the executed non-compete \nagreement had been sent by the plaintiff back to Alabama. Id. at 1372–73. The Eleventh \nCircuit discounted these connections to Alabama, finding “they did not have a close nexus \nwith the cause of action for breach of contract.” Id. at 1373. Because “all of the events \n‘giving rise to’” the claims occurred in Georgia, the court held Alabama was an improper \nforum. Id. \nIn its analysis, the Eleventh Circuit cited an Eighth Circuit case, Woodke v. Dahm, \n70 F.3d 983 (8th Cir. 1995), in which a plaintiff who sold and designed semi-trailers \nPage 31 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 32 of 82\nclaimed the defendant was passing off trailers under an identical trademark. Id. at 1371. \nThe plaintiff filed the case “in the state of his residency, Iowa, even though he had no \nevidence of wrongdoing in that state.” Id. (citing Woodke 70 F.3d at 985). To support \nvenue in Iowa, the plaintiff argued Iowa is “the location of the ultimate effect of the passing \noff.”  Woodke,  70  F.3d  at  985.  He  also  proffered  the  fact  that  the  trailers  were \nmanufactured in Iowa, before having the trademarks altered elsewhere. Id. Assessing the \nvenue claim, the Woodke court found the initial manufacturing of the trailers was too \ncausally remote from “the kinds of events that give rise to a claim” to be factored into the \nanalysis. Id. Without any other relevant connections to Iowa, the court “reject[ed the \nplaintiff’s] argument that venue lies in [Iowa] simply because that was where he was \nresiding when the passing off occurred.” Id. As the Woodke court explained, \nWhile the present venue statute was certainly intended to expand the number of \nvenues available to a plaintiff, we are reluctant to impute to Congress an intent to \nabandon altogether the protection of defendants as a relevant consideration in \nvenue matters. We think it far more likely that . . . Congress meant to require courts \nto focus on relevant activities of the defendant, not the plaintiff. \n \nId.  \nTwo guiding principles emerge from a more than cursory review of these cases \nand their reasoning. First, while the Court must “focus” the inquiry on the acts and \nomissions of the Defendant, these cases do not stand for the drastic proposition that the \nCourt must “ignore the place of injury altogether. They simply hold that the place of . . . \ninjury is not alone sufficient to create venue.” Am. Action Network, Inc. v. Cater Am., LLC, \nNo. 12-cv-1972, 2014 WL 12675253, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2014) (discussing Jenkins \nBrick and Woodke, among other cases). Indeed, courts within the Eleventh Circuit have \nregularly factored the location of injury into their analyses since Jenkins Brick was \nPage 32 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 33 of 82\ndecided.

The court noted that “[t]he old \nlanguage was problematic because it was oftentimes difficult to pinpoint the single district \nin which a ‘claim arose.’” Jenkins Brick, 321 F.3d at 1371. The court gave the example of \n“a toxic tort case in which the defendant’s factories in Colorado and Missouri pollute a \nriver, causing injury to Arkansas and Louisiana citizens who ingest the water.” Id. Under \nthe old statute allowing venue in only one district, a court would have been forced to “pick \na district in an arbitrary fashion,” since any of the locations provide a reasonable forum. \nId.  The  court’s  identification  of  Arkansas  and  Louisiana—districts  where  the  harm \noccurred in the hypothetical—as examples of possible venues, indicates the court’s \nunderstanding that harm is not wholly irrelevant to the analysis.  \nPage 33 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 34 of 82\nrelevant as “part of the ‘historical predicate’ of the claim.” MacDermid Printing Sols., LLC \nv. Clear Stamp, Inc., 2013 WL 3176887, at *5 (N.D. Ind. June 21, 2013). For example, in \nNorth MS Medical Center, the court held venue for an Emergency Medical Treatment and \nActive  Labor  Act  (“EMTALA”)  claim  was  appropriate  in  Alabama,  even  though  the \ndecedent was injured, hospitalized, treated, and eventually prematurely discharged in \nMississippi. 403 F. Supp. 2d at 1123. The court found that the hospital’s transportation of \nthe decedent in an ambulance back to his home in Alabama, where he later died of \nuntreated injuries, bore a “close nexus to the wrong,” even though “the alleged EMTALA \nviolation may have been satisfied the moment that [the defendant] wheeled [the decedent] \nout  the  front  door  of  the  [h]ospital[.]”  Id.  In  part,  this  was  because  the  Alabama \noccurrences would be part of “the proof at trial.” Id. \n  Turning  back  to  this  case,  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  alleges  that  Defendants’ \nconstruction and operation of the TNT site as an immigration detention camp violates \nvarious federal, state, and county laws. The NEPA claim asserts that because the project \ncreates  major  environmental  impacts  and  is  subject  to  significant  federal  control, \nDefendants were required to conduct certain environmental reviews beforehand and did \nnot. These claims implicate a broad range of Defendants’ conduct, and the scope of \nrelevant acts and omissions is equally broad, and includes: Defendants’ efforts to take \ncontrol of the TNT site and failure to obtain critical information from the site’s owner; \naspects of Defendants’ decision-making process regarding the facilities’ construction and \noperations; and, critically, any of Defendants’ detainee transportation, detention, and \ndeportation activities related to the project. A substantial portion of these events took \nplace and are taking place in Miami-Dade, within the S.D. Fla.  \nPage 34 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 35 of 82\n  First, because Miami-Dade owns the TNT site, Director Guthrie began the project’s \nexecution by sending a notice of intent to purchase the TNT site and associated lands to \nMiami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. (DE 12-3). Defendant Miami-Dade, through \nMayor Levine Cava, responded by alerting Director Guthrie to Miami-Dade’s concerns \nthat Defendants must “understand the scope and scale of the proposed use of the site \nand what will be developed, as the impacts [on] the Everglades ecosystem could be \ndevastating.” (DE 12-4 at 1). The State did not heed Miami-Dade’s warnings or ask for \nany  additional  information  from  Miami-Dade  to  educate  itself  on  scope,  scale,  and \nimpacts. This interaction was an initial act—or failure to act—in the joint, multi-step \ndecision-making  process  by  Defendants,  which  is  a  necessary  predicate  to  NEPA \ncompliance,  and  which  gave  rise  to  Plaintiffs’  NEPA  claim.  See  Russo,  2024  WL \n4571431, at *2–4 (in APA claim challenging a final rule promulgated by a federal agency, \nan antecedent meeting and vote by a regional council to send a proposed rule to the \nagency for approval “qualifies as an event that directly g[a]ve[] rise to the plaintiff’s claims” \neven though it was not the actionable event). The State then responded to Miami-Dade’s \nletter, notifying the County of the State’s intent to commandeer the property for use as a \ndetention camp. (DE 12-5).   \n  Next, Defendants’ use of the site includes actions currently taking place in the S.D. \nFla.  Most  importantly,  ICE’s  Miami  field  office  is  responsible  for  coordinating  and \nsupervising  immigration  enforcement  functions  conducted  by  deputized  state  law \nenforcement agency officials. (DE 21-1 ¶ 5, 8 (declaration from ICE Interim Assistant \nDirector of Field Operations Thomas Giles confirming that the detention camp operates \nunder Florida agencies’ 287(g) agreements with ICE); DE 118-1 ¶ 9 (declaration from ICE \nPage 35 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 36 of 82\nMiami field office director stating that he oversees the relevant 287(g) agreements)). In a \ndifferent case raising constitutional challenges to detainee treatment on the TNT site, the \nFederal Defendants filed a declaration by another ICE Miami field office official, Juan \nLopez  Vega,  in  which  he  attested  that  his  responsibilities  “include  overseeing \n[Enforcement and Removal Operations], and detention facility operations within the Miami \n[Area of Responsibility], including those at the South Florida Soft Sided Facility South \n(SFSSFS). . . . which is also known as Alligator Alcatraz.” C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 \n(S.D. Fla.), ECF 50-1 ¶¶ 3–4.18 Given that the sole use of the site is to detain those in \nfederal immigration custody, all activities on the site are supervised and directed by the \nMiami ICE field office. See supra Section I.B. (quoting language from 287(g) agreements \nstating, “[i]mmigration enforcement activities conducted by participating LEA personnel \nwill be supervised and directed by ICE.”). Additionally, the Federal Defendants bring \ndetainees from other Miami-Dade detention facilities to the TNT site. (DE 114 at 312–14). \nIn fact, in another case involving the detention camp, Federal Defendants recently filed a \nnotice that “the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) has designated Krome \nNorth Service Processing Center (Krome) as the immigration court with administrative \nresponsibility over the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.” C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 \n(S.D. Fla.), ECF 83. These core actions are alone sufficient to make venue proper in the \nS.D. Fla. See Managed Care Sols., Inc. v. Cmty Health Sys., Inc., No. 10-cv-60170, 2011 \nWL 6024572 at *3–4 (S.D. Fla.

When conducting a NEPA-triggering project in the Everglades area, \nthe federal government is required to coordinate with the Tribe, who has occupancy rights \nin BCNP, conducts preservation and restoration activities in the area, and historically has \naided federal agencies with their environmental reviews. See (Tribe Ex. 21 at IV-7; Tribe \nEx. 22 at 209, 213, 216; Tribe Ex. 23 at 193; DE 129 at 73, 113 (testifying about the \nTribe’s occupancy rights in BCNP and the Everglades National Park)). Over the past \ndecade, the Army Corps of Engineers has faithfully followed these protocols during the \nplanning and execution of WERP. When notices of NEPA projects go to the Tribe, they \nare sent to the Tribe’s administration building, located in Miami-Dade County. The Tribe’s \nenvironmental divisions work out of that building in coordination with federal agencies to \ncreate  environmental  impact  statements  (“EIS”).  The  same  holds  true  for  ICE’s \nconsultation of other relevant environmental groups. See (Pl. Ex. 154 (describing ICE’s \nconsultation with the Everglades National Park regarding its proposed expansion of the \nICE Krome SPC detention facility)). In this case, proof of the facts that no EIS was created \nand the Tribe was never consulted comes from the testimony of Tribal members and \nemployees, whose employment is based in Miami-Dade. (DE 129 at 33–34, 45 (testifying \nto Defendants’ failure to contact the Tribe before moving forward with the project, in \ncontrast to agencies’ usual protocol of consultation)). See Morgan, 403 F. Supp. 2d at \n1123 (recognizing that the source of the proof at trial is an indicator of the location of \nPage 37 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 38 of 82\nsubstantial events and omissions giving rise to a claim).  \n  Next, though not a dispositive consideration on its own, the locus of possible \nenvironmental harms within this district is relevant, particularly where Plaintiffs must show \nthat the project “significantly affect[s] the quality of the human environment” in order to \nprevail on their NEPA claim. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d 1563, 1572 (11th Cir. \n1994) (quoting § 4332(a)(C)). To begin with, increased runoff from the 800,000 square \nfeet of new paving and any wastewater from the site is likely to flow southeast, where just \na few miles from the site in Miami-Dade, eighty percent of Tribal members reside, Tribal \nschools are located, and the Tribe’s administration building sits. (DE 113 at 24, 79; DE \n129 at 16, 34, 45; Tribe Ex. 6 (tribal villages map)). This increased runoff creates risks of \ncarcinogens entering the Tribe’s water supply and of sediment and nutrients impacting \nthe plant and wildlife in the areas within Miami-Dade that the Tribe uses for hunting, \nfishing, and gathering certain plants. (DE 113 at 79; DE 129 at 107–08, 118–19). This \nchange to the quantity and consistency of runoff also risks disrupting the $20 billion \nWERP, which involves culverts and other infrastructure to manage the flow of water into \nsensitive wetlands conservation areas in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. (Pl. Ex. 34; \nDE 129 at 22–30). \nOther  harms  in  Miami-Dade  include  light  pollution  from  the  camp’s  intense \nindustrial lighting, which obstructs views of the night sky in Miami-Dade. See (DE 24-4 \n(depicting the light emanating from the site from 15 miles away in Miami-Dade); DE 114 \nat 309 (“it looks like we have a sports stadium in our backyard now”); Tribe Ex. 9 at 8–35 \n(measuring and documenting the increased sky brightness due to the project)). This light \npollution impacts the endangered bonneted bat’s critical habitat zone, which is located \nPage 38 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 39 of 82\npartially in Miami-Dade. (DE 129 at 132, 138–41). Further, since Defendants have altered \nthe site’s use, Tribal members have also been unable to access the main trails leading \ninto the BCNP lands within Miami-Dade for hunting and cultural and ceremonial activities, \nas those trailheads are directly adjacent to the site. (Id. at 122–27, 133, 164, 175). These \nharms and others giving rise to Plaintiffs’ NEPA claim, are relevant to the request for \ninjunctive relief, and support venue in this district.   \n  Defendants argue that Friends of Earth v. Haaland, counsels against this result. \n(DE 65 at 8 (discussing Friends of Earth v. Haaland, 2022 WL 185196, at *2-4 (D.D.C. \nJan. 20, 2022))). As that court noted, “[i]n cases brought under the APA, courts generally \nfocus  on  where  the  decision[-]making  process  occurred  to  determine  where  claims \narose.” Friends of Earth, 2022 WL 185196, at *3. But in that case, as in most NEPA cases, \nthe court was reviewing a single discrete agency decision—a Record of Decision made \nin Washington, D.C. rescinding agency approval for new oil and natural gas leases in the \nGulf of Mexico—and its relationship to the Western District of Louisiana. Id. at *1. Also in \nthat case, as in most NEPA cases, the court was tasked with reviewing a significant record \nof meetings, studies, and EIS’s to decide whether the decision-making process was \nsufficient under  NEPA.  Id. at  *3–4  (discussing  the  locations  of  the  agency’s  public \ncomment process, issuances of multiple EISs and a Record of Decision, and of dozens \nof studies). Under those circumstances, because nearly all of the acts comprising the \nNEPA process took place outside of the district in question, the court in Friends of Earth \nconcluded venue there was improper. Id. at *4.  \nBut this case is not the usual NEPA case. Here, Plaintiffs do not challenge a new \nrule or Record of Decision, which may be traceable to discrete moments of decision-\nPage 39 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 40 of 82\nmaking, but a project comprised of many “systematic and connected agency decisions[.]” \n40 C.F.R. § 1508.18(3) (describing the adoption of programs as a category of major \nfederal action). Here, there is no record of a NEPA process taking place in other districts \nbecause Defendants did not engage with a single step of the environmental review \nprocess in any district. Consequently, the Court’s review under NEPA necessarily focuses \non where studies should have been done and where interested parties should have been \nconsulted but were not.19  \nDefendants say the Court’s inquiry should be confined to Defendants’ decisions \nabout  project  construction,  which  they  say  took  place  in  either  Washington  D.C., \nTallahassee, Florida, or Collier County. This may be true (though the only supporting \nevidence Defendants have provided is one conclusory statement from a FDEM employee \nsaying “[a]ll substantial decision-making about the detention facility has occurred at either \nState offices in Tallahassee, Florida, or on-site in Collier County, Florida”). (DE 50-1 ¶ 4 \n(declaration of Ian Gadea-Guidicelli)). Yet other decisions relating to the setup of the \ncamp and its ongoing operations likely took place and continue to take place at the Miami \nfield office, which coordinates ICE’s oversight of the project’s immigration functions and \n \n19 Defendants’ reliance on Rodriguez-Diaz v. Donald is similarly misplaced. (DE 65 at 6, \n8, 9, 11 (citing Rodriguez-Diaz v. Donald, No. 14-cv-23055, 2015 WL 11217234 (S.D. \nFla.  Apr.  1,  2015)).  In  that  copyright  infringement  case,  this  Court  applied  in  a \nstraightforward manner the rule from Jenkins Brick that the focus of a Court’s inquiry \nunder § 1391(b)(2) should be on a defendant’s actions with a close nexus to the wrong. \nRodriguez-Diaz,  2015  WL  11217234,  at  *2.  And  because  the  defendant  DJ  had \nperformed and sold records in the S.D. Fla. while using an allegedly infringing nickname, \nvenue was proper even though those actions comprised a small share of the DJ’s overall \nsales and performances. Id. *1–2. Similarly, here, the Court has identified numerous \nactions and omissions by Defendants with a close nexus to the alleged NEPA violation, \nmaking venue proper even while many other aspects of the claim took place in other \ndistricts.  \nPage 40 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 41 of 82\nthe facilities’ compliance with ICE standards. See infra pp. 35–36.  \nFinally, it is noteworthy that the Friends of Earth court did credit the location of the \nimpact of the agency’s decision as relevant, but said “impacts alone cannot create proper \nvenue. . . .[,] [p]articularly . . .  where the impacts of any decision will be felt nationwide.” \nId. at 5. In this case, impacts are localized to Miami-Dade (and some other counties), and \nthese impacts are but one of the many relevant ties to the district. Therefore, the Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs’ claims against the State and Federal Defendants are properly in this \ndistrict.  \n4.  Discretionary transfer under section 1404(a) \nFederal Defendants alternatively ask the Court to transfer the case to the M.D. \nFla., where the majority of the TNT site is located. (DE 60 at 6). They rightly argue that \nvenue is also appropriate there under § 1391(e)(1). (Id. at 6–7). But Federal Defendants \nare wrong in their assertions that the only important factor to weigh is “the local interest \nin having localized controversies decided at home,” (id. at 7 n.4), and that this factor cuts \nin favor of venue in M.D. Fla. (Id. at 8). \n  “[A] plaintiff’s choice of forum should be honored so long as venue is proper there, \nunless substantial countervailing considerations militate to the contrary.” Bartronics, Inc. \nv.

Additionally, the court should weigh “various \npublic-interest considerations,” including “the administrative difficulties flowing from court \ncongestion [and] the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home[.]” \nAtl. Marine Constr. Co., 571 U.S. at 62 n.6 (2013) (internal quotations omitted).  \nFederal Defendants argue that NEPA cases “are resolved on an [a]dministrative \n[r]ecord and therefore” convenience of parties and witnesses and other trial efficiency \nconsiderations “do not play a significant role for purposes of the venue analysis.” (DE 60 \nat 7 n.4). That may be true in a typical NEPA case, where the Parties agree that a given \nagency action was subject to NEPA, and the agency conducted some environmental \nanalysis under NEPA, so there is an administrative record for the Court’s review. But \nagain, this is not a typical NEPA case. Here, the Parties dispute whether the project is \neven a federal action, and no Defendant conducted any environmental analysis prior to \nbuilding and operating the project; the merits of the NEPA claim will require fact-finding \nas there is no administrative record to rely upon. Additionally, Plaintiffs request permanent \ninjunctive relief. As the case progress, Plaintiffs will need to marshal testimony from \nwitnesses  and  other  discovery  related  to  irreparable  harm  and  equities,  making \nconvenience of witnesses and access to evidence relevant considerations. And both of \nthese considerations—convenience and access—weigh in favor of keeping the case in \nthe S.D. Fla. For one, the S.D. Fla. provides the closest federal courthouse to the TNT \nPage 42 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 43 of 82\nsite by 50 miles.20 Moreover, eighty percent of Tribal members live in Miami-Dade and \ntheir environmental resources division and tribal headquarters are based here. (DE 129 \nat 16, 34, 45; Tribe Ex. 6). Much of the evidence of environmental harms would also be \nderived from Miami-Dade. Further, Miami-Dade County owns the TNT site; property \nrecords, past site plans, ecological studies, and surveys are presumably located in  \nMiami-Dade.  \nNext, Defendants posit, without any support, that “the resolution of this case . . . \nwill have the greatest impact on the people and local governments of the Middle District[.]” \n(DE 60 at 8). But this is far from clear. Miami-Dade and other adjacent counties in the \nS.D. Fla. have similar, if not more compelling interests in the resolution of this case. Again, \nit cannot be overstated that Miami-Dade owns the site and certainly has a strong interest \nin how it is used. Some Miami-Dade residents live relatively close to the site and use the \nsurrounding areas for recreation. Tribal members have perhaps the most compelling \ninterest of any one demographic in how these claims are decided, and they are almost \nentirely local to Miami-Dade. This is not to say that residents in Collier County may not \nalso have a stake in the proceedings, but this factor does not clearly cut in favor of venue \nin the M.D. Fla.  \nGiven that the S.D.

It \nis meant, among other goals, to “fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee \nof the environment[,]” and “preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of \nour national heritage[.]” § 4331(b)(1),(4). To those ends, NEPA requires that any “major \nFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” be preceded \nby and EIS, which studies foreseeable environmental impacts of the project, feasible \nalternatives, and other factors impacting the balance between NEPA’s objectives and the \nbenefits of the project. § 4332(C).23 The EIS process must be done in consultation with \n \n23 The agency may prepare a less intensive “environmental assessment [(“EA”)]” for \n“proposed agency action that does not have a reasonably foreseeable significant effect \non the quality of the human environment, or if the significance of such effect is unknown[.]” \n§ 4336(b)(2). But even when an EA is appropriate, the decision to prepare an EA along \nwith the reasons for making this decision, must be articulated and published. Id.

Id.  \nTying together the statutory language, the NEPA claim requires Plaintiffs to show \nthat the construction and/or use of the detention camp involves (1) a final agency action, \nand (2) a major Federal action, (3) without Defendants conducting a compliant EIS. See \nSierra Club v. Van Antwerp, 526 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir. 2008) (describing a court’s \n“review of agency decisions” under APA and NEPA as “determin[ing] whether the action \nto be taken constitutes a ‘major Federal action’—that is, an action ‘significantly affecting \nthe quality of the human environment’”— and reviewing for the presence and sufficiency \nof an EIS under the APA’s arbitrary and capricious standard); see also Seven Cnty. \nInfrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cnty., 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1511 (2025) (describing a NEPA \nclaim as “argu[ing] that an agency action was arbitrary and capricious due to a deficiency \nin an EIS”). \nDefendants do not dispute that the camp and its operations have a sufficient \nimpact on the quality of the human environment to be considered “major,” justifying the \nneed for an EIS. Indeed, the Court reviewed plans and photos showing that operation of \nthe camp, to date, has involved paving approximately 800,000 square feet of land, \ninstallation of industrial lighting impacting the night sky at least 20 to 30 miles away, and \nenough residential infrastructure to house thousands of detainees and on-site staff. (Pl. \nExs. 22, 90–92 (Dr. McVoy report of new asphalting and TNT site plans); Tribe Ex. 9 \n \nthat an EA “shall be a concise public document prepared by a Federal agency to set forth \nthe basis of such agency’s finding of no significant impact or determination that an \nenvironmental impact statement is necessary”). \nPage 46 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 47 of 82\n(lighting report)). The camp employs as many as 1,000 staff members, many of whom \nreside on site, and can house multiple thousands of detainees at any given time. (DE 113 \nat 28, 33–34). Additionally, the project involves the daily movement of human waste, \nsewage, jet fuel, and significant vehicular traffic. (DE 38-5 (TDF Waste Management \nPlan)). In fact, several environmental experts opined that they expect the project will have \nconsiderable environmental impacts and would have required review by relevant federal \nagencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (DE 113 at 49 (Dr. McVoy opining \nthat he would have expected an EIS to be done before the facility’s construction based \non his experience with NEPA); DE 114 at 240 (testimony from Kautz that he “would have \nexpected consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for impacts, potential \nimpacts on the Florida panther, as well as other listed species in the area.”); DE 129 at \n130, 141 (testimony from Dr. Bozas that he expects there to be “effects on wildlife in the \narea” based “on the current level of human activity at the TNT [s]ite” and that the project’s \nincreased lighting would have required review by Fish and Wildlife Service due to its \nimpact on the bonneted bat’s critical habitat zone)); see also Hanly v.

These witnesses unanimously attest to the fact that \nPage 47 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 48 of 82\nthey were never notified of the project until news of the site became public.

Avoiding a discussion of environmental impacts and notice, \nthe Defendants instead say that there has been no final federal agency action. The Court \ntakes up these two issues next.  \na.  Final Agency Action \nCourts employ a two-part test to determine whether an agency action is “final” (and \ntherefore reviewable) under the APA. “First, the action must mark the consummation of \nthe  agency’s  decision[-]making  process—it  must  not  be  of  a  merely  tentative  or \ninterlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations \nhave been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotations omitted). To be a final agency action, the \nchallenged action must be one that represents “the agency's definitive position, affects \nthe parties' legal rights or obligations, and immediately impacts the regulated parties' daily \noperations.” RB Jai Alai, LLC v. Sec'y of Fla. Dep't of Transp., 47 F. Supp. 3d 1353, 1365 \nPage 48 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 49 of 82\n(M.D. Fla. 2014); see also Nat’l Parks Conservation Ass’n v.

Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 144 (1993))); Franklin v. \nMassachusetts,  505  U.S.  788,  797  (1992)  (“The  core  question”  in  the  finality \ndetermination is whether the result of the agency’s decision[-]making process “will directly \naffect the parties”); Am.

Franklin, 505 U.S. at 797 \n(alterations accepted and internal quotations omitted). The question before the Court is \nwhether the decision-making process, with respect to the detention camp, has advanced \nto the point where it has had a sufficiently direct and immediate impact on the parties’ \nrights and therefore qualifies as a reviewable final agency action. As discussed below, \nthe Court concludes that it has. \nAs  a  threshold  matter,  the  construction  of  the  camp  does  not  represent  a \npreliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling. Although it apparently \nlacks basic forethought in many ways, the facility has undergone substantial construction \nand is currently operational. Indeed, as Plaintiffs allege, the State and Federal Defendants \ncoordinated to “construct a mass migrant detention and deportation center” and have \ncompleted “the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services \nsystems, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, [and] diesel power generators.” \nPage 49 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 50 of 82\n(DE 1 at 17).  \nPrior to such construction, however, the Defendants were required, under NEPA, \nto issue an EIS or conduct an EA. The Defendants chose not to do so. Under the APA, \nthe “failure to act” qualifies as an “agency action.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). The Defendants’ \ndecision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention \ncamp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected \nPlaintiffs’  recreational,  conservational,  and  aesthetic  interests.  Accordingly,  the \nDefendants’ decision to not issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention \ncamp qualifies as a final agency action. See Hall v. Norton, 266 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2001) \n(explaining that a “decision not to prepare an EIS is a final agency action”); Hill v. Boy, \n144 F.3d 1446, 1450 (11th Cir. 1998) (“We review an agency’s decision not to prepare \nan EIS under an ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard of review.”); Catron Cnty.

Under  the \nstatutory language, the Defendants cannot put the cart before the horse—they cannot \nconstruct a facility and, then only in response to litigation such as the instant case, decide \nto fulfill their legal obligations.  \nNext, the decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA has directly impacted the \nrights of the Parties in this matter. As part of the EIS process, members of the public are \nafforded opportunities to comment on the proposed environmental action. During the \nPreliminary Injunction Hearing, Friends members and Tribe employees emphatically \nstated that they would have provided such comments. Instead, they lost the right to do so \nwhen Defendants refused to comply with their statutory obligations. See (DE 114 at  \n \n24 Under wholly disparate circumstances, some courts have stated that an “agency’s \ndecision not to prepare an EIS pursuant to the NEPA does not constitute a final agency \naction.” Karst, 403 F. Supp. 2d at 81 n.3 (citing Pub. Citizen v. Office of U.S. Trade \nRepresentatives, 970 F.2d 916, 918 (D.C. Cir. 1992)); see also Coalition for Underground \nExpansion v. Mineta, 333 F.3d 193, 196 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (when challenged Metrolink \nproject  had  not  yet  been  built  or  federally  funded,  Federal  Transit  Administration’s \ndecision not to conduct an environmental review did not “itself” constitute a final agency \naction). These cases stand for the unremarkable proposition that an EIS alone is not a \nfinal agency action where no “NEPA-triggering” major federal action has already occurred \nand where administrative processes are ongoing. Citizens for Clean Energy, 384 F. Supp. \n3d at 1280–81; see Public Citizen, 970 F.2d at 918 (Trade Representative’s failure to \nconduct an EIS prior to engaging in trade negotiations was “not itself a final agency action” \nin the absence of some “specific proposal for legislation or other action at least arguably \ntriggering the agency’s obligation to prepare an impact statement”) (internal quotation \nomitted).  By  contrast,  here,  the  detention  camp’s  construction  and  existence  are \nundisputed. In this context, the decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA is a final \nagency action. \nPage 51 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 52 of 82\n55–56,  74).  Besides  this  lost  engagement  opportunity,  Plaintiffs’  relationship  to  the \nPreserve—recreationally, or as conservationists—was also compromised by Defendants’ \nfailure to issue an EIS or conduct an EA. For example, Plaintiffs’ expert, Randy Kautz \ntestified that the Florida panther has lost 2,000 acres of habitat as a result of the facility’s \nconstruction and use of intense lights disturbing the habitats of these nocturnal creatures. \nSee (DE 114 at 232). Moreover, several witnesses testified about how the facility’s light \npollution  has adversely  affected their ability  to  observe  the night  sky.25  (Id. at  34). \nAccordingly, because the decision to construct the detention camp without issuing an EIS \nor conducting an EA is a definitive position which has caused actual, concrete injury to \nthe Plaintiffs’ recreational and conservational interests, the Court finds that the action was \na final agency action. \nNo Defendant has endeavored to explain their decision to abstain from issuing an \nEIS or conducting an EA. Instead, the Federal Defendants contend that “[n]either ICE nor \nFEMA has implemented, directed, or controlled the construction work at the temporary \ndetention center.” (DE 21 at 3). This contention runs contrary to significant evidence \nPlaintiffs have adduced that the facility’s construction was requested and fully funded by \nthe federal government. See infra Section III.C.1.b. Instead of addressing the failure to \nissue an EIS or conduct an EA as a final agency action, Defendants attempt to reframe \nthe issue as one involving the detention camp’s ultimate funding. Defendants point to the \nfact that the detention camp’s construction costs have been initially shouldered by Florida \n \n25 Big Cypress National Preserve is recognized as an International Dark Sky Park and \noffers visitors a unique opportunity to observe the Milky Way with their naked eyes.

Accordingly, Defendants \nargue that the “reimbursement decision . . . has not yet been made . . . [and] there cannot \nbe final agency action.” (DE 16 at 11). However, the Court does not, and is not, compelled \nto focus on the funding decision, since the lack of an EIS and EA qualifies as final agency \naction given Federal Defendants’ intimate involvement in, and control over, the detention \nfacility. See Sw. Williamson Cnty. Cmty. Ass’n, Inc. v. Slater, 243 F.3d 270, 279 (6th Cir. \n2001)  (“major  federal  actions  need  not  be  federally  funded  to  invoke  NEPA \nrequirements”).  \nb.  Major Federal Action \nSection 4336e(10) of NEPA defines “major federal action” as an action that “is \nsubject to substantial Federal control and responsibility.” It excludes non-federal action \n“with no or minimal Federal funding” and “no or minimal Federal involvement where a \nFederal agency cannot control the outcome of the project[.]” 42 U.S.C. § 4336e(10)(B)(i). \nNEPA implementing regulations promulgated by the Council on Environment Quality \nreiterate this definition in the affirmative, defining “Major Federal action [as] actions with \neffects that may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control and \nresponsibility.” 40 C.F.R. §1508.18. According to that regulation, federal actions “include \nnew and continuing activities, including projects and programs entirely or partly financed, \nassisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies[.]” § 1508.18(a).  \nThough “federal courts have not agreed on the amount of federal involvement \nnecessary to trigger the applicability of NEPA,” the Eleventh Circuit has had occasion to \nanalyze the issue. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 28 F.3d at 1572. In that case, the Eleventh \nCircuit  analyzed  whether  the  Federal  government  negotiating  and  administering  a \nPage 53 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 54 of 82\nsettlement agreement with Florida agencies responsible for insuring water quality in the \nEverglades constituted major federal action. Id. at 1568, 1572 (“We must determine \nwhether . . . sufficient federal involvement exists in what is proposed in the Settlement \nAgreement to constitute major federal action affecting the environment under NEPA.”). \nThe focus of the court’s analysis was “on the federal agencies’ control and responsibility \nover material aspects of the specific project.” Id. at 1572. As the court explained, “[t]he \ntouchstone of major federal activity constitutes a federal agency’s authority to influence \nnonfederal  activity.  ‘The  federal  agency  must  possess  actual  power  to  control  the \nnonfederal activity.’” Id. (quoting Sierra Club v. Hodel, 848 F.2d 1068, 1089 (10th Cir. \n1988)); see also Goos v. I.C.C., 911 F.2d 1283, 1294 (8th Cir. 1990) (“In deciding whether \na federal agency exercises legal control, we must therefore consider whether some \nfederal action is a legal condition precedent to accomplishment of an entire nonfederal \nproject.”) (internal quotations omitted). \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected the notion that the federal government’s power to \ninfluence  state  action  through  “advocacy  and  negotiation”  in  litigation  or  “invok[ing] \ndispute resolution mechanisms” in resulting settlements is “synonymous with a federal \nagency’s authority to exercise control over a nonfederal project.” Id. at 1572–73. Instead, \nwhat matters is whether the “state agencies retain their state law authority to make the \ndecisions concerning the project,” or, in other words, whether project or program in \nquestion is implemented “pursuant to existing authority under Florida law[.]” Id. at 1573.  \nDefendants argue that the decision in S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist. advises against \nfinding  major  federal  action  here  because  the  Federal  Defendants  have  not  yet \nreimbursed the State for construction costs of the project and “Plaintiffs offer no evidence \nPage 54 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 55 of 82\nthat the federal government is controlling the State’s construction on State land.” (DE 16 \nat 8). The Court will discuss the Defendants’ untenable claims regarding funding shortly. \nSee infra pp. 62–64. But more critically, Defendants ignore the reality that all immigration \nenforcement  activities  associated  with  the  camp—key  drivers  of  the  project’s \nenvironmental impact—are entirely under federal control and pursuant to federal law.26  \nGiven that the camp acts exclusively as “an immigration detention facility,” (DE 105 \nat 18), any state officials working on site with detainees are doing so as deputized federal \nimmigration officers pursuant to 287(g) agreements. See (Pl. Ex. 144 at 5 (official post of \nFDHSMV announcing 287(g) agreement and deputized FHP troopers “ICE Task Force \nOfficers”)). Those officers “are not authorized to perform immigration officer functions \nexcept when working under the supervision and direction of ICE personnel.” Supra \nSection I.B. Under the agreements, the actions of those officials “will be reviewed by the \nICE supervisory officers on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with the requirements \nof the immigration laws and procedures.” Id. This alone provides the requisite “federal \nauthority” over the project required under S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist.  \n \n26 To the extent Defendants seek to disaggregate the camp’s initial authorization and \nconstruction from its ongoing operations and argue that the project is not federal if the \ninitial aspects of the project were state-run, NEPA’s pragmatic paradigm does not allow \nfor evasion of responsibility by parsing agency actions in this artificially atomistic way. \nSee e.g., Okeelanta Corp. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 132 F.4th 1320, (11th Cir. 2025) \n(“An agency cannot evade its responsibilities under [NEPA] by artificially dividing a major \nfederal action into smaller components”) (internal quotations omitted); Chilkat v. Indian \nVill.  of  Klukwan  v.  Bureau  of  Land  Mgmt.,  825  F.  App’x  425,429  (9th  Cir.  2020) \n(considering whether the exploration for and construction of a mine were “connected \nactions” under NEPA and explaining that “[t]he critical question is whether each of two \nprojects would have taken place with or without the other”) (internal quotations omitted); \n40 C.F.R. § 1508.18(3) (including “programs, such as a group of concerted actions to \nimplement a specific policy or plan” and “systematic and connected agency decisions” \namong the types of major federal actions); § 1508.25 (defining “connected actions” and \nrequiring an EIS to discuss all connected actions). \nPage 55 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 56 of 82\nAdditional facts support this conclusion. The camp operates using “ICE detention \nstandards.” (DE 21-1 ¶ 5); see also supra Section I.B. (documenting the requirement in \nthe operative 287(g) agreements that “the policies and procedures to be utilized by the \nparticipating [state] personnel in exercising [immigration functions] shall be DHS and ICE \npolicies  and  procedures,  including  the  ICE  Use  of  Force  Policy”);  C.M.  v.  Noem,  \n25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 57 at 272 (facility’s visitation policy stating it adheres to \nICE/ERO policy and operates in “in coordinate with ICE/ERO’s public affairs objectives). \nIn all of its 287(g) agreements with Florida agencies, ICE is also “responsible for the \ninstallation  and  maintenance  of  the  Information  Technology  (IT)  infrastructure”  and \nrequires that any agency with access to its systems follow its “Sensitive System Policy \nand Rules of Behavior.” C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 53-1 at 5, 19, 50, \n66, 81, 96, 111, 126. Consequently, the IT systems at the camp were installed by ICE \nand are under federal control.  \nFurther, ICE directs arresting law enforcement officers whether to take people into \ncustody  on  suspicion  of  immigration  violations,  (DE  129  at  187,  213);  ICE  “makes \ndecisions regarding transfer into [the facility] based on the posture of aliens’ immigration \nproceedings,” C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 50-1 ¶ 6 (declaration of Juan \nLopez Vega); ICE “maintains custody” of the detainees, (Pl. Ex. 43 at 4 (SERT South \nFlorida Detention Facility Continuity of Operations Plan)); and it is federal officials who \nphysically transport detainees on and off site and conduct deportations using federally-\nowned aircraft. See (DE 114 at 97 (testimony of Representative Eskamani that she \nobserved ICE vehicles dropping off detainees and that Director Guthrie confirmed this \nwas the standard protocol); id. at 312–14 (testimony of Jessica Namath that she observed \nPage 56 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 57 of 82\nICE-contracted and Customs and Border Protection vehicles transporting between ICE \nKrome SPC detention facility and the TNT site); DE 129 at 203, 214–15 (testimony of \nDirector Kerner that either federal agencies or contractors, not state agencies, transport \ndetainees to and from the TNT site, and federal agencies are conducting the deportations \nusing federally-owned airplanes); Pl. Ex. 59 (video of Customs and Border Protection \nvans leaving the site); DE 24-2 (photo of DHS transport bus exiting the TNT site)). \nThat the deputized officers’ regular salaries are paid, required uniforms are bought, \nand standard work hours are controlled by their state agency supervisors is not germane \nto questions involving the TNT facility, because their status there as deputized officers \nand their activities at the camp are controlled by ICE. See e.g., (DE 129 at 225–27 \n(testimony of Director Kerner); DE 118-1 ¶ 13 (describing the ways in which state agency \nsupervisors retain control for non-immigration aspects of deputized officers’ employment); \nDE  118-1  ¶ 12  (“DHS  provides  credentials  and  guidance  to  local  law  enforcement \npartners, and signs warrants for service as needed. DHS is required to provide direction \nand supervision to local law enforcement officers when taking immigration enforcement \nactions”)); C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), ECF 53-1 at 32–33 (“ICE officers will \nprovide  direction  and  supervision  for  participating  LEA  personnel  only  as  to  the \nimmigration enforcement functions . . . . The LEA retains supervision of all other aspects \nof the employment and performance of duties of participating LEA personnel.”); id. at 33 \n(providing that deputized officers “performing immigration-related duties pursuant to [the \n287(g) agreement] will be assigned to various units, teams, or task forces designated by \nICE”); id. at 34 (requiring that all candidates to become deputized immigration officers \n“must be approved by ICE”); id. at 35 (“The ICE supervisory officer . . . will evaluate the \nPage 57 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 58 of 82\nactivities of all personnel certified under [a 287(g)].”).  \nNationwide, Courts have recognized the legal and practical reality that ‘“ICE is in \ncomplete control of detainees’ admission and release,’ while the [287(g) agreement] \n‘places  the [deputized  state  agents]  in  the  role  of  a  mere functionary.’” Masingene  \nv.

June 17, 2005).    \nDefendants next claim that “the ultimate decision of who to detain at the” camp \n“belongs to Florida,” and this precludes the project from being a federal action. (DE 21-1 \n¶ 6); DE 105 at 18 (positing that the State can “turn down anyone they want”)). For one, \nto be a major federal action, a project need not be under complete control by federal \nauthorities  in  all  respects,  but  merely  “subject  to  substantial  Federal  control  and \nresponsibility.”  42  U.S.C.  §  4336e(10(B)(i).  In  fact,  NEPA’s  statutory  language \ncontemplates projects that are led in large part by state entities but still trigger NEPA.  \n§ 4332 (G)(i) (allowing an EIS for certain “major Federal action[s]” to be prepared by a \nstate agency official if “the State agency or official has statewide jurisdiction and has the \nresponsibility for such action[.]”). Second, it is ICE that decides whether and where an \napprehended person will be detained for not having legal status. (DE 129 at 187). And if \nPage 58 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 59 of 82\nFlorida  began  unilaterally  rejecting  large  swaths  of  detainees,  ICE  is  contractually \nauthorized to terminate the 287(g) agreement, which would lead to the shuttering of the \nfacility. See e.g., (DE 24-3 at 8–9 (287(g) agreement with FHP detailing the process for \nICE  to  terminate  the  agreement)).  Even  if  Florida  has  some  authority  to  reject  a \nprospective detainee, the fact that the federal government is responsible for selecting the \npool of prospective detainees and transporting them to the camp gives the federal \ngovernment significant control over who is housed there.  \nDefendants make a few additional arguments in their ill-considered attempt to \navoid the implications of the project’s federal activities, but each fails. First, Defendants \nsay the detention activities are not reviewable under the APA, § 702(a)(2), because DHS \nsecretary has discretion over detainees’ detention locations under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1). \n(DE 16 at 12). But “[t]he question for §701(a)(2) purposes is whether there is ‘no law to \napply’ for the exercise of discretion being challenged.” Mass. Coal. for Immgr. Reform  \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 698 F. Supp. 3d 10, 37 (D.D.C. 2023). It “does not matter \nwhether the Government has discretion [over detention locations] or not. That question is \nnot before the Court” in a NEPA claim. Id. “What is before the Court is the decision not to \ncomply with NEPA” . . . . [a]nd on that, the Government has no discretion.” Id. (citing \nCalvert Cliffs’ Coordinating Comm. v. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm’n, 449 F.2d 1109, 1114 \n(D.C. Cir. 1971)).  \nNext, Defendants argue the operations of the site fall into a NEPA exemption for \n“bringing  judicial  or  administrative  civil  or  criminal  enforcement  actions[.]”  \n§  4336e(10)(B)(v);  see  also  (DE 105 at 21).  The construction and  operation of an \nimmigration detention facility is plainly not an enforcement action. Compare Mass. Coal. \nPage 59 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 60 of 82\nfor Immgr. Reform v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 698 F. Supp. 3d 10, 20 (D.D.C. 2023) \n(DHS’s  “return  to  Mexico”  immigration  policy  did  not  meet  the  NEPA  “enforcement \naction[]” exemption because it “goes well beyond the decision whether to enforce the law \nin individual cases”), with Sierra Club v. Penfold, 857 F.2d 1037, 1313 (9th Cir. 1988) \n(describing the agency’s right to “issue notices of noncompliance” and then “commence \nenforcement proceedings” as coming within the enforcement action exemption), Civil \nAction, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (a legal action “brought to enforce, redress, \nor protect a private or civil right”). In recognition of this, in 2024 DHS performed a NEPA \nevaluation before ICE’s expansion of the Krome detention facility. See (Pl. Ex. 154). \nFinally, Defendants argue that “even if Florida is exercising federal power when it \ndecides where to detain, the APA turns on whether a federal agency is making the \ndecision not whether federal power is being exercised.” (DE 130 at 108). But Defendants’ \npremise  fails.  The  evidence  and  legal  framework  governing  deputized  state  law \nenforcement agents’ immigration activities make clear that they are not only exercising \nfederal authority; their conduct is controlled by ICE. Consequently, the cases Defendants \ncite have no bearing on the issue. Neither applies NEPA’s major federal action standard \nnor discusses the state-federal relationship in immigration enforcement. See Lebron v. \nNat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 397, 399 (1995) (holding Amtrak was “part of \nthe Government for purposes of the First Amendment”); Ritter v. Cecil Cnty. Off. of Hous. \nand Comm. Dev., 33 F.3d 323, 327–28 (4th Cir. 1994) (interpretation of HUD regulation \nby local housing board is reviewed under something like Skidmore deference, not the \nAPA’s arbitrary and capricious standard). Defendants attempt to seize on dicta, in which \nJustice Scalia mentioned that an entity’s status as a federal agency can be defined by \nPage 60 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 61 of 82\nstatute “for purposes of . . . whether it is subject to statutes that impose obligations or \nconfer powers upon Government entities, such as the [APA][.]“ Id. at 392. The closest \nanalog to this situation is § 1357(g)(7)–(8), where Congress specified that deputized \nofficers  are  “acting  under  color  of  Federal  authority”  when  performing  immigration \nfunctions under a 278(g) agreement. But it is worth noting Justice Scalia’s pronouncement \nin Lebron that “[i]t surely cannot be that government, state or federal, is able to evade the \nmost solemn obligations imposed in the Constitution by simply resorting to the corporate \nform.” Lebron, 513 U.S. at 397. \nThe Federal Defendants’ control over operations at the camp should suffice to end \nthe analysis. However, evidence that the project was built at the Federal Defendants’ \nrequest and that federal funding has been committed to the State for the entire cost of \nthe project both support the conclusion that the Federal Defendants were “so intimately \ninvolved in the discussion and planning” of the project that they “cannot now claim to have \nno responsibility under NEPA[.]” Fund for Animals v. Clark, 27 F. Supp. 2d 8, 13 (D.D.C. \n1998).   \nFDEM has acknowledged in its own written materials about the camp that it was \nbuilt  after  “DHS  and  [FEMA]  request[ed]  the  State  of  Florida  to  supplement  [its \nimmigration enforcement] capacity with a temporary detention facility.” (Pl. Ex. 43 at 4). \nAccording to Representative Eskamani, Director Guthrie confirmed to her directly while \nleading a tour of the camp that the project was the result of DHS’s written request.  \n(DE 114 at 96). These statements align with those of other high level public officials. ICE \nField Officer Director Garrett Rippa described the project as “state, local, and federal \npartners working in unison, working as one” and promised that ICE “will continue to utilize \nPage 61 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 62 of 82\nth[e] facility.” (Pl. Ex. 61 at 0:25–1:01). DHS Secretary Noem explained that the project \nwas conceived when her general counsel “called up Florida’s Attorney General and \nGovernor” and requested they partner with DHS to build the detention center. (Pl. Ex. 63 \nat 0:05–0:32). Governor DeSantis said the same: the project was “requested by the \nfederal government.”27 Defendants argue that “a local plan does not become a major \nfederal action subject to NEPA regulations merely upon its approval by a federal agency.” \nRattlesnake, 509 F.3d at 1102. But Defendants fail to recognize that the situation in \nRattlesnake—“[t]he  development  and  improvement  of  sewage  treatment  by  a \nmunicipality[—]is intrinsically a local matter under the responsibility of local government.” \nId. Here, it is beyond peradventure that the detention of undocumented persons and \ndecision as to their ongoing status is a uniquely federal question under the authority, \ncontrol, and supervision of the federal government.  \nAdditionally, the Federal Defendants acknowledge that DHS “announced $600 \nmillion in federal funding for the Detention Support Grant Program” and the “only eligible \napplicant  .  .  .  is  the  Florida  Division of  Emergency  Management.” (DE  21-2 at  2) \n(declaration of David Richardson) (emphasis added). Governor DeSantis confirmed that \nthe federal government will “fully fund” the facility.28 And Secretary Noem posted on social \nmedia that “Alligator Alcatraz will be funded largely by FEMA’s Shelter and Services \n \n27 Fox 35 Orlando, ‘Alligator Alcatraz’: Florida Gov. DeSantis speaks on immigration \nproject,  YOUTUBE  (June  25,  2025),  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJfG7L9reHU. \nSee Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 520 nn.4, 6–7 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (taking \nnotice of government officials’ statements during press conferences and interviews); \nMcLoughlin v. People’s United Bank, Inc., 586 F. Supp. 2d 70, 73 (D. Conn. 2008) (“The \nCourt may take judicial notice of the press releases of government agencies.”).  \n28 See supra n.27. \nPage 62 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 63 of 82\nProgram.”  (Pl.  Ex.  144  ¶  5).  Furthermore,  Assistant  United  States  Attorneys  made \nrepresentations in court that “[t]he Everglade[s] detention facility is being funded from a \ncontinuing resolution for [fiscal year] 2025” of the Shelter and Services Program. See City \nof Chicago v. DHS, 25-cv-05463 (N.D. Ill.), ECF 35 at 1–2.  \nDespite  these  clear  and  unequivocal  public  assertions  of  federal  funding, \nDefendants would have this Court find that a “reimbursement decision . . . has not yet \nbeen made.” To reach this conclusion, however, would require the Court to disregard \nthese unambiguous statements from government representatives. Instead, taking all of \nthis context into consideration, it is apparent that the reimbursement funding decision has \nin fact been made.  \nIn Scottsdale Mall v. State of Indiana, the court had no difficulty in concluding the \nhighway project at issue was a major federal action when “the record indicate[d] federal \nparticipation in the programming, location, design, preliminary engineering, and right of \nway acquisition stages.” Scottsdale Mall v. Indiana, 549 F.2d 484, 489 (7th Cir. 1977). In \nthat case, the state claimed it would “refund” monies to the federal government that had \nbeen committed to a segment of the project. Id. at 487. This, the state argued, gave it the \n“prerogative to avoid compliance with NEPA.” Id. at 488. The court rejected this argument, \nnoting that “[s]uch accounting transfer of federal funds from one state project to another \nunder the guise of ‘refund’ have been viewed with disfavor[.]” Id. at 487 n.5. The court \nfound that  where a  state  takes  “substantial  steps”  to  program a  project  for  federal \nassistance, it cannot “withdraw the program from federal funding consideration with a \nresulting  avoidance  of  complying  with  federal  environmental  statutes.”  Id.  at  488. \nSimilarly, the Defendants’ legal legerdemain regarding funding does not convince the \nPage 63 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 64 of 82\nCourt.  As  the  Tribe’s  counsel  argued:  “If  this  is  allowed,  effectively,  the  [f]ederal \n[g]overnment is laundering federal control or federal approval through a grant program \nwith only one applicant who’s eligible to receive the money. And if that’s allowed, then \n[NEPA] is effectively useless[.]” (DE 130 at 131). \nIn light of the conclusion that the funding decision has been made, the Defendants’ \ncases are unpersuasive. In S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., for example, the Eleventh Circuit \nstated, “[t]he possibility that federal funding will be provided in the future is not sufficient \nto federalize a state project, even when such funding is likely.” 28 F.3d at 1573. Thus, \nDefendants argued at the Preliminary Injunction Hearing that the possibility of federal \nfunding for the detention camp precludes any finding of a reviewable, final federal agency \naction. As the Court explained supra, however, the instant matter goes well beyond a \npossibility. Unlike S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., this case does not involve hypothetical \nproposals  that  may  never  materialize.  Instead,  the  evidence  demonstrates  that  the \ndetention  camp  was constructed at the  request  of  the  federal government,  with its \ncooperation and counsel, and with specifically earmarked funds to reimburse any state \nexpenditures. The instant matter is not a situation where the State is applying to a general \nprogram from which it may or may not receive reimbursement since, as the “only eligible \napplicant,” the only “competition” they face in receiving the award is the State’s decision \non when it will be conferred.29 \n \n29 Defendants point the Court to cases involving grant programs that were generally open \nto applicants and instances where the grantors had not made final decisions as to the \ngrants. See, e.g., Karst Envtl. Educ. & Prot., Inc. v. EPA, 403 F. Supp. 2d 74, 81 (D.D.C. \n2005) (concluding that there was no final agency action where HUD had yet to consider \nand approve a grant application for disbursal of appropriated funds because “the federal \nmoney is but an expectancy that has not yet materialized”) (citation and internal quotation \nmarks  omitted);  Rattlesnake  Coal.  v.  EPA,  509  F.3d  1095,  1103  (9th  Cir.  2007) \nPage 64 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 65 of 82\nDefendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because \nits employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the \nfederal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some \nunidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated. Meanwhile, the project was \nrequested  by  the  federal  government;  built  with  a  promise  of  full  federal  funding; \nconstructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force \nOfficers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE \nofficials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal \nimmigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and \ndeported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the \ncamp is a major federal action, the Court will “adhere to the time-tested adage: if it walks \nlike a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.” Van Antwerp, 526 \nF.3d at 1359.  \nDefendants make a final argument that, even if the Court finds Defendants have \nviolated NEPA, Plaintiffs should not receive the injunction they request because the Court \nmay “call for a remand without vacatur.” (DE 16 at 13–14). “[V]acatur is the ordinary APA \n \n(explaining that “[t]he congressional appropriation to the EPA of funds for a particular \nproject does not constitute a final agency action by the EPA until the EPA has reviewed \na grant application and decided to disburse the funds.”) The Court finds that these cases \nare factually inapposite. Karst, for instance, involved the award of a federal grant to a \nstate  agency  for  the  purpose  of  developing  an  industrial  complex.  In  Karst,  HUD \nrepresentatives  explained  that  “it  had  taken  some  action  with  respect  to  the  grant \napplication, but that it ha[d] not yet ‘obligated’ the money.” Karst, 403 F. Supp.2d at 81. \nAccordingly, the federal funding was “but an expectancy that [had] not yet materialized.” \nId. Unlike the instant case, however, that grant program did not appear to be designed \nspecifically for the grantee but was a general program from which the grantee sought \ndisbursement. In the instant case, there is not just an “expectancy” of federal funding—\nelected officials stated in unambiguous terms that the reimbursement would happen.   \nPage 65 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 66 of 82\nremedy,” but the Court has discretion to remand an agency action without vacatur, leaving \nthe agency’s action in place while it completes a satisfactory NEPA evaluation. Black \nWarrior Riverkeeper, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 781 F.3d 1271, 1290 (11th Cir. \n2015) (alterations accepted) (quoting Antwerp, 526 F.3d at 1369). The considerations \ncourts weigh in this decision make clear why a vacatur without remand is inappropriate \nhere. Those are “the seriousness of the [agency] order’s deficiencies (and thus the extent \nof doubt whether the agency chose correctly) and the disruptive consequences of an \ninterim change that may itself be changed.” Id.  \nHere, there weren’t “deficiencies” in the agency’s process. There was no process. \nThe Defendants consulted with no stakeholders or experts and did no evaluation of the \nenvironmental risks and alternatives from which the Court may glean the likelihood that \nthe agency would choose the same course if it had done a NEPA-compliant evaluation. \nIt will come as no surprise that every case Defendants cite where the court remanded \nwithout vacatur involved a meaningful evaluative process by the agency before their final \naction. See e.g., Port Isabel v. Fed. Energy Regul. Comm’n, 130 F.4th 1034, 1037  \n(D.C. Cir. 2025) (“The Commission has already issued extensive final environmental \nimpact statements reflecting more than three years of review and public comment.”); Ctr. \nfor Biological Diversity v.

Plaintiffs also proved that runoff \nand  wastewater  discharge  from  the  camp  risks  polluting  the  water  supply  in  the \nMiccosukee Reserved Area—where eighty percent of Tribe members reside—just a few \nmiles downstream from the TNT site, and beyond. Finally, Plaintiffs show ongoing harms \nto organizational and Tribal members’ enjoyment of the preserved areas due to the \nproject’s industrial lighting, noise, traffic, and security perimeter.  \nFirst, the creation of 800,000 square feet of new impervious surface will increase \nPage 67 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 68 of 82\nrunoff into the surrounding, interconnected wetlands, which threatens the “extremely \nsensitive . . .[,] low nutrient” hydrology of the Everglades. (DE 113 at 46–47). Dr. McVoy \ntestified that the Everglades and BCNP are peculiar and particularly sensitive in at least \ntwo ways: first they are interconnected wetlands that require “sheet flow,” meaning water \nflows with little obstruction across large areas, impacting the entire ecosystem;30 and \nsecond, they are “naturally very low nutrient level, and when you introduce nutrients, \nparticularly . . . phosphorous, nitrogen, potassium, it disturbs the ecosystem drastically.” \n(Id.). According to Dr. McVoy, the legal requirement for water introduced into the wetlands \nis quite low and that requirement is the result of “a lot of science that clearly demonstrated \nthe link that anything higher than that disturbs the system.” (Id. at 47). With the newly \npaved surface, “anything that falls in th[ose] 20 acres will go directly into the wetlands.” \n(Id. at 49). The possible contaminants in any runoff come “from a number of different \nsources” on the site. (DE 129 at 41). It could come from the paved material itself, from \npetroleum products on-site to fuel generators, from the vehicles and from thousands of \ndetainees and staff doing laundry, cooking, cleaning, using restrooms. (Id. at 41–42). \nBeyond contaminants entering the water, “increased sediment . . . in the wetlands \noftentimes leads to increased turbidity . . . [and] decrease[d] dissolved oxygen,” which \ncan kill aquatic animals. (DE 129 at 42, 136); see also (DE 5-2 ¶ 18 (declaring that the \nendangered Everglade snail kite relies on the “preserve’s aquatic ecosystem for survival” \nand would be harmed by the project’s wastewater and runoff)).    \nDefendants argue that they have mitigated these risks by installing silt fencing.  \n \n30 Plaintiffs introduced aerial footage of the natural wetlands surrounding the TNT site, \nwhich followed the unbreaking sheen of contiguous water below the thin layer of swamp \nvegetation, until the natural landscape was interrupted by TNT site. (Pl. Ex. 145).  \nPage 68 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 69 of 82\nBut multiple Plaintiffs’ experts provided unrebutted testimony that that silt fencing “is not \nsuitable in the long-term to be able to reduce any storm water runoff that could potentially \naffect neighboring areas.” (DE 113 at 108). Especially in a large storm event, those \n“temporary structures . . . could be easily . . . toppled and allow for sediment and storm \nwater to pass through.” (Id. at 118). Given Defendants’ complete lack of other stormwater \nmanagement features, silt fencing is not “an appropriate substitute for a soil geologist \ndesigned storm water management system.” (Id.). Defendants also quibble with geologist \nDillon Reio’s calculation that the 800,000 square feet of new pavement would increase \nrunoff by almost “10 million gallons over a 72-hour, 100-year storm event[,]” attacking his \nassumptions regarding how permeable the now-paved area had originally been, given \nthat some of that area was compacted when the jetport was originally built. (Id. at 80,  \n95–104). But even if Defendants are correct that the true increase in peak discharge could \nbe some unknown lesser amount, there is sufficient likelihood that the increased runoff \nwill  harm  the  surrounding  wetlands  given  the  ecosystem’s  interconnectedness  and \nsensitivity to warrant preliminary injunctive relief. Plaintiffs are not required to prove harms \nof a particular probability or quantity, as “[p]art of the harm NEPA attempts to prevent in \nrequiring  an  EIS  is  that,  without  one,  there  may  be  little  if  any  information  about \nprospective environmental harms and potential mitigating measures.” Winter, 555 U.S. at \n23; see also Fla. Wildlife Fed’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 404 F. Supp. 2d 1352, 1362 \n(S.D. Fla. 2005) (“A fundamental purpose of NEPA is to ensure that important effects will \nnot be overlooked or underestimated only to be discovered after resources have been \nPage 69 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 70 of 82\ncommitted or the die otherwise cast.”) (internal quotations omitted).31 To make matters \nworse, it appears Defendants have imminent plans to expand this paving significantly, as \nthey have already contracted to purchase 1.8 million square feet of asphalt. (Pl. Ex. 126 \nat 1 (purchase order for 200,000 square yards of asphalt)).32  \n These risks impact the wetlands ecosystem, but they also present direct risks to \ncommunities who depend on water from the Everglades for their water supply, including \nthe Tribe. As the Court has discussed, the overwhelming majority of Tribal life is enjoyed \nand experienced just a few miles southeast of the TNT site. Based on the general \ndirection of water flow in the area around the project, water from TNT site is likely to flow \ninto  the  Tribe’s  water  supply,  risking  contaminating  the  water  of  Tribal  residences, \nschools, the Tribe’s government building, and businesses. Water also “flows from the \njetport into Monroe County” and “Dade County” due to the connective features of the L28 \nCanal that were built under WERP. (DE 129 at 24–25). \nNext, the project creates irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased \nmortality to endangered species in the area. For example, Dr. Bozas testified that the \n \n31 Defendants repeat this same argument with regard to nearly every harm Plaintiffs \nidentify. Defendants cross-examined Plaintiffs’ witnesses on the fact that few had data \nshowing baselines from before the site was constructed or data showing developments \nsince the project came online. Of course, because Defendants did not consult with \nPlaintiffs or any other research group before constructing the project in eight days, there \nwas no opportunity to collect baseline data. And since Defendants have refused access \nto nearly everyone seeking to visit the site, Plaintiffs’ experts have been unable to take \nany samples or collect other data useful for empirical study. Further, the harms Plaintiffs \nfear  take  time  to  accrue;  and  time  and  access  for  study  is  precisely  what  NEPA \nprocedures are meant to afford. See Fund for Animals v. Rice, 85 F.3d 535, 546 (11th \nCir. 1996) (“NEPA ‘works’ by requiring that the environmental consequences of an action \nbe studied before the proposed action is taken.”).  \n32 This and other evidence of Defendants’ expansion plans undermines Defendants’ \nargument that “Plaintiffs point to harm that is too late to prevent[.]” (DE 16 at 16).  \nPage 70 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 71 of 82\nendangered eastern black rail has been detected in the area around the site and that the \nTNT site is within the bonneted bat’s critical habitat zone.33 (DE 129 at 142). Both of these \nspecies are nocturnal, and the increased lighting from the project “will push” those \nanimals “out of the area. They do not use illuminated habitats.” (Id. at 132). Moreover, the \nincreased noise from additional construction and ongoing human activity on the site also \ndisrupts the bats’ “ability to [echolocate] prey.” (Id.)  \nAdditionally, the lighting from the site immediately reduces the panther habitat by \n2,000 acres, as studies suggest panthers are unlikely to come within 500 meters of a \nlarge artificial light source. (DE 114 at 232). Defendants dismiss this habitat loss as merely \na minuscule share of the total few 3.11 million acres of significant panther habitat. (Id. at \n262). But 2,000 acres is “hardly a de minimus injury” from one project to those hoping to \nsee panthers in the area and to preserve and maintain panthers’ habitats. Alliance for the \nWild Rockeies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011) (loss of 1,652 acres of \nforest caused sufficient irreparable harm to plaintiffs’ ability to enjoy the area undisturbed \nto warrant injunction, despite representing only 6% of the relevant area); see (DE 114 at \n158–60 (Amber Crooks testimony about her efforts to track panthers in the area); id. at \n229–34 (Kautz testifying that a 2,000-acre loss may well reduce the panther population \ndue to, among other impacts, inter-species aggression)). Further, vehicular strikes are \nthe number one cause of panther mortality, and stretches of the highway close to the TNT \nsite are known “hot spots” for panther strikes. (DE 114 at 161, 194; DE 38-6 at 24–25 \n(showing that 20 to 35 Florida panthers die per year from roadkills and documenting the \n \n33 Critical habit zones are a “formal designation that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife makes for \nsome listed species.” (DE 114 at 243). \nPage 71 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 72 of 82\nmortality records near the site)).34 \nThe  ongoing  light  pollution  from  the  project  also  harms  Plaintiff  members’ \nenjoyment of the night sky—for which BCNP has received certification as an International \nDark Sky Park. See supra n.25; (DE 113 at 20–21 (describing what is required to maintain \na dark sky designation); DE 114 at 34 (discussing the impact the site will have on area’s \ndark sky designation); id. at 303 (describing the “pitch black darkness with beautiful [views \nof the] Milky Way and sky where you can see all of the stars”)). As the Court has \ndiscussed,  Plaintiffs  provide  empirical  data  proving  that  the  project  meaningfully \nincreases the brightness for miles around the site. See e.g., (Tribe Ex. 9 at 8–35). This \ndata factors in the prior existence of a few small, lit buildings on the jetport site.  \n  Finally, the Tribe provided testimony that Tribal members have lost access to the \noff-road trails leading into the BCNP lands for hunting and other activities due to the \ncamp’s operations. (DE 129 at 122–27, 133 164, 175). Furthermore, Tribal members had \npreviously harvested plants from the areas directly adjacent to the TNT site for ceremonial \nand  medicinal  purposes,  but  the  camp’s  new  human  activity  erodes  the  cultural \n \n34  Defendants  also  maintain  that  telemetry  data  acquired  by  tracking  a  sample  of \npanthers’ movements over time, suggest that panthers have not been seen within a few \nmiles of the site for many years. (Pl. Ex. 25 at 19, 26). In Defendants’ view, this proves \nthat no panther-related harm will be caused by the project, as the area was not in use by \nthe panther population even before the project’s construction. Defendants distort the \nsignificance of this data. Only some unknown fraction of the panther population was \naffixed with tracking collars, as researchers’ goal was “not to monitor every place within \nthe range of panthers that panthers occur.” (DE 114 at 279). Collection of data from the \nradio collars also ceased in 2014 due to budget cuts. (Id. at 275). And several of Plaintiffs’ \nwitnesses had either seen panthers in the area or knew others who had. See e.g., (DE \n129 at 143 (testifying to having captured recent panther presence in the area of the site \non trail cameras)). The fact that the data shows that panthers were detected within a four-\nmile radius of the TNT site 1,164 times in the few decades between 1982 and 2014 proves \nthat the area was a functioning panther habitat despite airport activity at the TNT site. (Pl. \nEx. 25 at 19). \nPage 72 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 73 of 82\nsignificance of the plant life. (Id. at 120, 134, 155–56); see also Oglala Sioux Tribe v. \nNuclear Regul. Comm’n, 896 F.3d 520, 524, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (reversing agency \nfinding of no irreparable harm where tribe challenged uranium mining project that risked \ndestruction of cultural, historical, and religious sites in the project area); Hualapai Indian \nTribe v. Haaland, 755 F. Supp. 3d 1165, 1197 (D. Az. 2024) (holding that plaintiff Indian \ntribe met the irreparable harm requirement “because it has shown that damage to . . . a \nculturally significant site for the [t]ribe[] is likely”).35 \nDefendants’ rejoinder to all this is that the TNT site was already in use as a training \nairport, and Plaintiffs have not proven that the detention camp creates harms above and \nbeyond those already wrought by the site’s prior use. Specifically, Defendants point to \nflight logs showing that over the seven months starting in January 2025, there were about \n28,000 “flight operations” from the site, or 137 per day. (DE 116-1 ¶ 11). In other words, \nover that period there were approximately 14,000 takeoffs and landings each. (Id. at 34). \n \n35 The Hualapai case is particularly instructive. The Hualapai tribe filed for a preliminary \ninjunction  to  enjoin  drilling  for  lithium  on  property  adjacent  to  a  sacred  hot  spring, \n“Ha’Kamwe’.” Hualapai, 755 F. Supp. 3d at 1173. The tribe alleged that BLM failed to \nconsider any reasonable alternative before approving the project; prematurely terminated \nits consultation process with the tribe; and failed to take a hard look at impacts in its EA \nby not analyzing geologic faults that could pollute the aquifers feeding Ha’Kamwe’. Id. at \n1186.  The  court  decided  an  injunction  was  appropriate,  finding  that  under  NEPA \n“[c]onsideration of reasonable alternatives is necessary to ensure that the agency has \nbefore it and takes into account all possible approaches to, and potential environmental \nimpacts of, a particular project.” Id. at 1192 (internal quotation omitted). As the court \nexplained, the defendants had failed to consider alternatives, such as approving fewer \ndrilling sites located farther away from Ha’Kamwe’. Id. at 1193. Finally, the court found \nthe tribe was likely to suffer irreparable harm if the drilling project went forward “through \nits impact to Ha’Kamwe’s character.” Id. at 1198–99 (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 22). The \ndecision in Hualapai supports the entry of a preliminary injunction in this case where no \nreasonable alternatives were considered, no environmental assessment of any kind was \nconducted and no consideration of any type of impact was undertaken. In sum, not only \ndid Defendants fail to take a “hard look” as required by NEPA, they failed to take any look.  \nPage 73 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 74 of 82\nAlmost 80% of these were by single engine aircraft. (Id.) Defendants say these aircrafts \nsurely would have been sufficiently noisy to scare off animals and impede any recreation \nin  the  nearby  areas.  (DE  16  at  5–6).  Plaintiffs  present  their  own  flight  data  from  \n2020-2024, documenting around 11,600 flights total, or about 6 per day (not double-\ncounting takeoffs and landings). (Pl. Ex. 33).   \nThe Court need not parse which Party’s interpretation of the flight data presents a \nmore accurate picture of the site’s prior activity, because even Defendants’ version of the \ndata does not support the notion that the airport use caused similar harms as those posed \nby the detention camp. For one, several witnesses testified under oath that they worked \nor recreated in that area for years leading up to the camp’s construction and noticed little \nor no noise from the airport. E.g., (DE 114 at 176–77; DE 129 at 32, 87, 130). Defendants \ndiscount  these  individual  experiences  as  less  accurate  than  flight  data,  but  this \nmisconstrues the import of these eyewitnesses’ testimony. An irreparable harm inquiry is \nfocused on how an event, in this case noise, impacts the effected individuals. Beyond \nthis, many harms separate from noise undisputably were created or are exacerbated by \nthe  detention  camp.  The  light  pollution  is  far  worse  now  than  before  the  camp’s \nconstruction. (Tribe Ex. 9). The addition of 800,000 square feet of asphalt paving (with \nanother 1 million planned) increases harmful water runoff relative to the areas previously \npaved. (Pl. Exs. 22, 90–92, 126 at 1). The frenetic human activity, including vehicular \ntraffic and wastewater from thousands of people daily, was essentially absent prior to the \ndetention camp’s construction. See (DE 113 at 27 (Dr. McVoy recounting a statement by \nthe TNT site’s Incident Commander Dr. Frank E. Lumm that prior to the detention center \nthe airport had “four employees, most of whom were involved in mowing the grass”)). In \nPage 74 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 75 of 82\nshort, Plaintiffs have provided substantial evidence to prove that irreparable harm from \nthe detention camp is ongoing and likely to worsen absent injunctive relief. The Court will \nnext  consider  the  balance  between  these  harms  and  the  Government’s  interest  in \ncontinuing detention operations at this site before conducting the required NEPA analysis.  \n3.  Balance of equities and public interest \nFor similar reasons, the balance of equities and the public interest favor granting \na preliminary injunction. “These two factors merge when, as here, the government is the \nopposing party.” Farmworker Ass’n of Fla. v. Moody, 734 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1342 (S.D. \nFla.  2024)  (internal  quotations omitted). The  Court has  discussed  the  ongoing  and \npossible  future  irreparable  harms  caused  by  Defendants’  NEPA  violation.  When \nirreparable environmental harms are sufficiently likely, “the balance of harms will usually \nfavor the issuance of an injunction to protect the environment.” Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. \nat  545.  The  Court  acknowledges  Defendants’  unchallenged  position  that  the \ngovernment’s interest in immigration enforcement is significant. Immigration is at the \nforefront  of  national  and  state  politics:  as  the  swell  of  people  seeking  refuge  and \nopportunities in our nation steadily increases, the government is under a corresponding \npressure to respond and regulate. \nThe Federal Defendants argue that “the significant national interest in combatting \nunlawful immigration favors allowing Florida to continue the development and use of [the \ndetention camp].” (DE 21 at 7). To this end, the Federal Defendants rely on Thomas Giles’ \ndeclaration that the detention camp’s function in detaining aliens “operationally benefits \nICE and furthers its immigration enforcement mission.” Id. Giles goes on to state that the \ndetention camp serves to “decompress other detention facilities used to house aliens \nPage 75 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 76 of 82\nthroughout the United States.” (DE 21-1 at 5).  \nThis position, however, flounders when confronted with the weight of evidence as \nto the irreparable harm posed by Defendants’ flouting NEPA protocols. Plaintiffs have \nprovided extensive evidence supporting their claims of significant ongoing and likely \nfuture environmental harms from the project. See supra Section III.C.2. By contrast, while \nthe Defendants repeatedly espouse the importance of immigration enforcement, they \noffered little to no evidence why this detention camp, in this particular location, is uniquely \nsuited and critical to that mission. Director Kerner did state that his troopers “have \nencountered and apprehended people that have active warrants for murder in other \ncountries” and offered his belief that some of those individuals might be detained at the \ndetention camp. (DE 129 at 202). Director Kerner could not, however, offer any statistics \nor reports specifying how many individuals actually housed at the facility had such a \ncriminal background. (Id. at 206). He could not directly testify that even one of the \ndetainees had a criminal record, much less a record of violent crimes necessitating their \nseclusion from society in the Everglades. (Id. at 206, 219).  \nDirector Kerner further asserted that the detention camp is necessary because \nother immigration facilities are at capacity. (Id. at 205). This need, however, again fails to \nexplicate the decision to place the detention camp in the Everglades.36 Counsel for the \n \n36 Any detention capacity issue also appears will be mitigated by the State’s recent \nannouncement  of  a  second  temporary  immigration detention facility  with  “the  same \nservices as Alligator Alcatraz” also with costs to be “reimbursed by federal partners.” \nPress Release, Executive Office of the Governor, Governor Ron Desantis Announces \nExpansion of Florida’s Capacity to Detain and Deport Illegal Aliens (Aug. 14, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/3HXE-73VY.

Supp. 2d at 73 (“The Court may take judicial notice of the press \nreleases of government agencies.”); Coastal Wellness Ctrs., Inc. v. Progressive Am. Ins. \nPage 76 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 77 of 82\nFederal Defendants opined that the detention camp housed “all sorts of people from all \nwalks of life” and claimed that the camp’s remoteness is “relevant to the national security \nand public safety interest at play here.” (DE 130 at 68, 77-78). When pressed by this \nCourt, however, the Federal Defendants conceded that they actually had no opinion on \nthe efficacy of the detention camp’s location, saying that the location “is a question for \nFlorida to decide.” (Id. at 69). The Federal Defendants further conceded that there was \nno issue with the operation of other ICE detention facilities in populated areas like \nJacksonville and Boca Raton. (Id. at 78). Thus, at least for the Federal Defendants, the \nremoteness of the detention camp seems to be an inconsequential consideration.  \nThe State Defendants also insisted that the detention camp’s remoteness was an \nimportant consideration. The State presented testimony from Director Kerner that the \ndetention  camp’s  site  was  “ideal”  because  “first  and  foremost,”  it  is  “far  removed.”  \n(DE 129 at 225). Director Kerner also pointed to the site’s “very long runway[,] which is a \nvery critical piece of the deportation process.” (Id.) But aside from their use of adjectives, \nneither the State nor Director Kerner could explain why such a place needs to be in the \nEverglades. What is apparent, however, is that in their haste to construct the detention \ncamp, the State did not consider alternative locations. Indeed, Director Kerner testified \nthat the current detention camp is the “only site that [he] looked at.” (Id. at 223).  \nAllowing  the  detention  camp  to  continue  expanding  its  infrastructure  and \noperations poses an even more formidable challenge than maintaining the status quo \nbecause “it is difficult to change that course” if the Court eventually decides that NEPA \n \nCo., 309 F.

Defendants brush aside this concern by pointing to Justice Kavanaugh’s \nremark  in  Seven  County  that  “NEPA  has  transformed  from  a  modest  procedural \nrequirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents.” 145 S. Ct. \nat 1513. But while the Seven County case cited by counsel for the State is instructive, it \nis  not for  the phrases  parsed  by  counsel.  While  the  Court  did  discuss how  NEPA \nrequisites could sometimes be an impediment to critical projects, the comment was made \nin the context of that particular case: a 3,600-page EIS generated over a year-long period \nwith the input of six public meetings and more than 1,900 public comments. Id. at 1508. \nThis is hardly a meaningful guide in a matter where there was no consultation with the \npublic and no reports of any page length regarding a project that was erected in eight \ndays. Instead, this case exemplifies why NEPA’s modest mandate that an “agency [take] \na ‘hard look’ at the environmental consequences of [a] proposed action” before saddling \ncommunities and future generations with unknown environmental risks is still an important \nprocedural check.

The Court fully understands the interests of the Defendants and \nthe importance of a well-ordered transition while Defendants modify the facility to perform \nthe necessary environmental assessments. The construction of the facility may have \ntaken only eight days, but the capacity of the Defendants to remedy the NEPA violations \noutlined will involve a longer period of time. The Court has endeavored to provide that \ntemporal accommodation in its Order. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn 1947, President Harry Truman dedicated Everglades National Park observing: \nNot often in these demanding days are we able to lay aside the problems of the \ntime, and turn to a project whose great value lies in the enrichment of the human \nspirit. Today we make the achievement of another great conservation victory. We \nhave  permanently  safeguarded  an  irreplaceable  primitive  area.  We  have \nassembled to dedicate to the use of all people for all time, the Everglades National \nPark.37 \n \nTwenty years later, a proposal for construction of the world’s largest jetport—at the \nsite discussed in this case—was abandoned, and the Big Cypress National Preserve was \ncreated to protect this area.38 Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida \nsenator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have \npublicly  pledged  their  unequivocal  support  for  the  restoration,  conservation,  and \nprotection of the Everglades. This Order does nothing more than uphold  the basic \nrequirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises. \n \n \n37 Harry S.

For the purposes of Defendants becoming compliant with their obligations under \nNEPA, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Plaintiffs’ Motion for \na Preliminary Injunction (DE 5), as follows:  \n2.  The Court ENTERS a Preliminary Injunction prohibiting the State and Federal \nDefendants39 and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person \nwho is in active concert or participation with them from (1) installing any additional \nindustrial-style lighting (described by witnesses as “Sunbelt” lighting); or doing any \npaving, filling, excavating, or fencing; or doing any other site expansion, including \nplacing or erecting any additional buildings, tents, dormitories, or other residential \nor administrative facilities on the TNT site; and (2) bringing any additional persons \nonto the TNT site who were not already being detained at the site at the time of \nthis  Order  going  into  effect.  The  Preliminary  Injunction  does  not  prohibit \nmodification or repairs to existing facilities, which are solely for the purpose of \nincreasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site.  \n3.  The Preliminary Injunction shall include among those “who are in active concert or \nparticipation  with”  the  State  or  Federal  Defendants  or  their  officers,  agents, \nemployees,  or  attorneys,  and  thus  prohibited  from  conducting  the  activities \nspecified  above,  any  contractors,  subcontractors,  or  any  other  individuals  or \n \n39 Though state agencies are not subject to the APA, when “state and federal [actions] \nare sufficiently interrelated,” the Court may enjoin state entities from acting in violation of \nNEPA.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2)(C) (including \n“other persons who are in active concert or participation with” the parties or the \nparties’ officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys among those bound \nby any injunction). \n4.  No later than sixty (60) days from the date of this order, and once the population \nattrition  allows  for  safe  implementation  of  this  Order,40  the  Defendants  shall \nremove 1) the temporary fencing installed by Defendants to allow Tribe members \naccess to the site consistent with the access they enjoyed before the erection of \nthe detention camp; 2) the Sunbelt lighting fixtures and any additional lighting \ninstalled for the use of the property as a detention facility; and 3) all generators, \ngas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed to support \nthis project.  \n5.  Finally, Plaintiffs shall post a bond of $100. See BellSouth Telecomm., Inc. v. \nMCImetro Access Transmission Servs., LLC, 425 F.3d 964, 971 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(internal citations omitted) (“the amount of security required by the rule is a matter \nwithin the discretion of the trial court”). \n \n40  Based  on  Defendants’  representation  that  the  site  is  currently  being  used  as  a \ntransportation spoke to other facilities, the Court is relying on programmatic attrition of the \ncamp’s population within the next sixty days. See C.M. v. Noem, 25-cv-23182 (S.D. Fla.), \nECF 50-1 ¶¶ 10 (stating that the detention facility on the TNT site “provides short-term \nhousing while longer term housing or removal arrangements are secured for aliens”). This \nattrition will allow Defendants time to remove the newly installed fencing, lighting, and \nother fixtures and utilities apparatus in a safe, humane, and responsible manner. The \nhousing and detention dormitory facilities may remain and be maintained to prevent \ndeterioration or damage. \nPage 81 of 82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-22896-KMW   Document 131   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2025   Page 82 of 82\nDONE AND ORDERED in Chambers in Miami, Florida, on this 21st day of August, \n2025. \n \nPage 82 of 82 \n ",
