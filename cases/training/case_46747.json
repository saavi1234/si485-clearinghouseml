Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which amended the Clean Air Act to include the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program.

Funding was allocated to nonprofits, schools, tribes, and local governments which applied for the grants; thousands of grant applications were culled using strict criteria. Following Trump's inauguration in January 2025, the EPA did not terminate these organizations' grants individually and with specific reasons for each, but rather did so en masse and without supplying any reasoning.

Dkt. 98 at 2. Although these funds remain \nobligated, EPA has recently taken steps to close out these grants and de-obligate the funds.   \nIf and when these funds are de-obligated, EPA has made clear that it will incorrectly view \nthese funds as rescinded – and that they will be returned to the Treasury, making it almost \nimpossible for Plaintiffs to secure meaningful relief should they prevail on appeal. This Court \nshould issue a temporary order to prevent Defendants from unilaterally foreclosing judicial \nreview of their unlawful actions by forever extinguishing any prospect of relief. \nTo maintain the status quo and ensure the funds remain available should Plaintiffs \nultimately prevail, Plaintiffs respectfully request an injunction under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 62(d) temporarily prohibiting EPA from treating as rescinded any funds appropriated \nby Congress for Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants through Section 138 of the \nClean Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7438) and returning those funds to the Treasury. Instead, those \nappropriated funds should remain available to restore the Environmental and Climate Justice \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 2 of 14\nBlock Grant program should Plaintiffs succeed on appeal. Notably, the federal government has \nagreed to similar relief in a similar grants case. Order at 3-4, Vera Inst. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, \nNo. 25-cv-1643 (July 21, 2025) (noting agreement of the parties and enjoining DOJ from “re-\nobligating or otherwise diminishing the sums awarded but terminated”). \nWhile this Court’s August 29, 2025 Order denied Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary \ninjunction and class certification and granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs submit \nthat they have established the factors warranting a narrow injunction pending appeal under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(d). \nARGUMENT \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(d) authorizes the Court to grant an injunction pending \nappeal in order to “secure the opposing party’s rights.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(d). By definition, Rule \n62(d) “necessarily envisions situations in which a district court that has denied an injunction still \ngrants an injunction pending appeal.” United States v. Facebook, Inc., No. 19-cv-2184 (TJK), \n2024 WL 291739, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 12, 2024). This is true “even if the court that just denied \ninjunctive relief” believes “its analysis in denying relief is correct.” Id.   \nWhile the standard for relief under Rule 62(d) is “substantially the same” as that for a \nmotion for a preliminary injunction, in some circumstances relief is appropriate “even without a  \nlikelihood of success on the merits” when the threat of irreparable harm is “grave,” the balance \nof the equities “decisively” favors relief, and the movant “establishes a ‘serious legal question’ \non the merits and shows that ‘the other three factors tip sharply’ in its favor.” Id. (citation \nmodified).  \nIn such cases, an injunction pending appeal is “necessary to preserve the ability of the \ncourt of appeals to hear the case before it becomes moot, even where the plaintiff’s chances on \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 3 of 14\nthe merits are uncertain.” MediNatura, Inc. v. FDA, 2021 WL 1025835 at *6 (D.C. Cir. 2021); \nsee also Washington Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 844 \n(D.C. Cir. 1977) (finding “substantial equity, and need for judicial protection, whether or not \nmovant has shown a mathematical probability of success.”). This is particularly true in cases like \nthis one when the “trial court is charting a new and unexplored ground” by “ruling on an \nadmittedly difficult legal question.” Protect Our Water v. Flowers, 377 F. Supp. 2d 882, 884 \n(E.D. Cal. 2004) (citation modified). \nI.  Recission of Plaintiffs’ awarded funds poses a grave threat of irreparable \nharm. \n \nAn injunction pending appeal is “especially appropriate” when the “subject matter of the \ndispute will be destroyed or otherwise altered in a way that moots the pending appeal.”  \nMediNatura, Inc. v. FDA, 2021 WL 1025835 at *6 (D.C. Cir. 2021).  As the D.C. Circuit in \nMediNatura explained, “[o]nce a tree has been felled and sent to the sawmill” the “pine is gone \nforever”—while “a short delay in clearing the trees does little prejudice to the government.” Id. \nHere, the core of the dispute is funds that Congress appropriated to EPA and EPA \nawarded to Plaintiffs under the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program.  In \nFebruary through May 2025, EPA purported to terminate Plaintiffs’ grants. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) at ¶ \n114.  After the litigation was initiated, EPA has taken the position that at the time of termination, \nfunds obligated to the grants were immediately de-obligated—and thus subject to the recission of \n“unobligated balances” by H.R.1, signed into law on July 4, 2025. Ex. 1 (Letter to Grantees).   \nPlaintiffs vigorously dispute EPA’s position. For the reasons explained in Plaintiffs’ \nbriefing, EPA’s claim that these funds were immediately de-obligated fails as a matter of both \nfact and law – and is directly contrary to EPA’s own regulations. See Dkt. 77 at 2-5 (Reply in \nSupp. of Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj.); Dkt. 87 at 7-10 (Pls.’ Mem in Opp. to Defs.’ Mot. to \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 4 of 14\nDismiss). While EPA has unlawfully terminated these grants, that step did not result in the \nimmediate de-obligation of the funds. Instead, de-obligation only occurs at the end of a lengthy \nclose-out process between grantees and the government. 2 C.F.R. § 200.344.  \nAs shown by internal EPA documents, the agency understands that de-obligation only \nbegins once grantees submit a final financial report. Ex. 2 (internal EPA memo from Vonda \nJennette, Director of the Office of Controller). Grant recipients typically have 120 days following \ntermination to submit the final financial report, as well as the opportunity to both appeal the \ndecision through an administrative process and litigation. \nGiven EPA’s written threats regarding rescission, Ex. 1, it is uncontested that EPA intends \nto attempt to de-obligate the funding used for Plaintiffs’ grant awards, treat those funds as \nrescinded, and return those funds to the Treasury. Permitting EPA to do so during the pendency \nof the appeal would gravely—and irreparably—harm Plaintiffs because the funds would no \nlonger be available should Plaintiffs succeed on their claims – exactly the situation that \nMediNatura cautions should be avoided.  \nIn contrast, maintaining the status quo, and leaving the funds intact, would not harm the \nGovernment: Plaintiffs are not currently able to draw down on the funds and they remain within \nEPA’s control. If Plaintiffs prevail on appeal, those funds should remain available for EPA to \ncarry out Congress’ mandate in Section 138 of the Clean Air Act. This is not a situation in which \nEPA would need to recover funds from Plaintiffs – if Plaintiffs are not successful, EPA will have \nsimply held these funds during the pendency of the appeal. Thus, this factor weighs heavily in \nfavor of granting this motion. \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 5 of 14\nII.  The public interest and balance of the equities decisively favor relief here. \n \n Plaintiffs have shown that the public interest and equities weigh heavily in their favor. \nDkt. 29-1 at 38-41; Dkt. 77 at 24-25. An evaluation of these factors requires a consideration of \nthe “relative harms” of the parties and “the interests of the public at large.” Barnes v. E-Sys., Inc. \nGrp. Hosp. Med & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.S. 1301, 1305 (1991). This Court’s decision – \nfocused primarily on jurisdiction – did not disturb this showing and the equities here tip even \nfurther in favor of the Plaintiffs as they only seek a temporary restraint on the Government \nmoving the funds beyond court access during the pendency of the appeal. \nFirst, Plaintiffs face the prospect of a toothless victory should they prevail on appeal if \nDefendants fail to preserve access to the funds Congress appropriated for the Environmental and \nClimate Justice Block Grant program. Defendants, by contrast, face no cognizable harm by an \ninjunction preventing them from placing those funds beyond reach. As the D.C. Circuit explained \nin MediNatura, an injunction to preserve the subject matter of the appeal is appropriate as “a \nshort delay … does little prejudice to the government.”  MediNatura, Inc., 2021 WL 1025835 at \n*6.  Thus, the balance of harms here tips decisively in favor of Plaintiffs. \nSecond, the public interest weighs heavily in favor of preserving access to these funds \nshould Plaintiffs succeed on appeal. This is particularly true when – as here – Plaintiffs contend \nthat that this Congressionally-mandated grant program was unlawfully terminated and the Court \nhas not found otherwise.1 There is “generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful \nagency action.” League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Further, the \nEnvironmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program serves communities across the country \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ complaint was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but that conclusion does not rest \non any finding that the government acted lawfully. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 6 of 14\n– and it serves the public interest to preserve the ability of Plaintiffs to access the funds that \nCongress appropriated for this program should they succeed in their claims on appeal. \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ claims on appeal raise serious legal questions on the merits.  \n \nAt a minimum, Plaintiffs raised serious legal issues on the merits for the reasons \nexplained in their prior briefing. While the Court denied a preliminary injunction because it \nconcluded that it lacked jurisdiction—recent Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit cases demonstrate \nthat the answer to these jurisdictional questions is nuanced. Plaintiffs contend that the Court has \njurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims independent of any waiver of sovereign \nimmunity. Likewise, Plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act claims that Defendant’s action was \nboth arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law remain within the jurisdiction of federal district \ncourts under current D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court caselaw. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Constitutional claims do not require a waiver of sovereign \nimmunity \n \nFirst, Plaintiffs have raised a serious legal question as a matter of law because their \nconstitutional claims do not require a waiver of sovereign immunity and must be heard in federal \ndistrict court.  While this Court concluded that plaintiffs’ constitutional claims were “statutory,” \nand relied on the D.C. Circuit’s recent decision in Global Health Council, that characterization – \nand reliance – raises a serious question of law as that opinion has since been revised. Dkt. 98 at \n20 (Mem. Opinion), citing Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097, 2025 WL 2326021, at \n*1 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 13, 2025); but see Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097, 2025 WL \n2480618 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 13, 2025) (revised opinion); Order, Glob. Health Council, No. 25-5097, \nDoc. No. 213525 at 8 (D.C. Cir.  Aug. 28, 2025) (denying rehearing en banc) (J. Garcia \nStatement) (“[w]hether that holding [about constitutional claims] is correct is not only an \nimportant question but also a complex one,\"); Id. at 5 (J. Pan, dissenting from denial of rehearing \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 7 of 14\nen banc) (“because the Dalton issue will likely recur, our en banc court may have another \nopportunity to correct the panel opinion’s erroneous reasoning . . . [s]hould the Dalton issue \ncome before us again, we should take the first opportunity to revisit and correct the mistake that \nthe court has made.”). \nThe preliminary injunction reviewed by the D.C. Circuit in Global Health Council related \nto a funding freeze and suspensions arising from claims that the Executive Branch violated two \nstatutes – the Impoundment Control Act and the Anti-Deficiency Act. Any dispute about the \nlegality of “large-scale contract terminations” was not part of the district court's injunction and \nwas not before the panel. Glob. Health Council, 2025 WL 2480618 at *13. In that narrow \ncontext, the panel found that the related constitutional claims were an attempt to reframe the \nImpoundment Control Act and Anti-Deficiency Act statutory violations – and thus foreclosed \nunder Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994). Id. at *6; see also id. at *4 (observing that the \ndistrict court found “no indication” that the President “had complied with the procedures \nrequired by the ICA or the Anti-Deficiency Act”).  \nWhile this Court concluded that Plaintiffs’ “do not allege that defendants claimed to have \nacted under “inherent constitutional power,” Dkt. 98 at 20 citing Dkt. 1 (Compl.) at ¶ 176, this is \nnot true as the cited portion of Plaintiffs’ complaint makes clear.  In the Complaint, which must \nbe accepted as true for the purposes of a Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs asserted that the federal \ngovernment acted without identifying any “statutory, regulatory, or constitutional authority.” Dkt. \n1 at ¶ 176. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' separation of powers claim is not predicated on any violation \nof a statute giving certain powers to the President.  \nInstead, as in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claim lies in the absence of authority for the executive branch to ignore a statutory \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 8 of 14\nmandate to spend funds. See Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473; Compl. ¶¶ 13; 109-15 (alleging EPA \nimplemented executive orders to terminate grants and touted terminations as “taxpayer savings”). \n  Plaintiffs’ claims here are more like the D.C. Circuit’s prior panel opinion in In re Aiken \nCounty, which awarded the plaintiffs extraordinary mandamus relief where the executive branch \nwas “declin[ing] to follow a statutory mandate . . . simply because of policy objections” and was \n“refus[ing] to spend [appropriated] funds.” 725 F.3d 255, 259-60, n.1, (D.C. Cir. 2013). Any \nbroader reading of Global Health Council would place it at odds with Aiken, and as the earlier \npanel decision, Aiken would control. See Maxwell v. Snow, 409 F.3d 354, 358 (D.C. Cir. 2005) \n(discussing law of the circuit doctrine).  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act claims belong in federal district \ncourt \n \nPlaintiffs bring two Administrative Procedure Act claims that are relevant here.  First, \nthat the termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program was contrary \nto law because it violated the Constitution, the appropriations statute, and the Impoundment \nControl Act; and second, that termination of the entire program was arbitrary and capricious.  \nThe Court’s opinion in this case was issued one day after the most recent D.C. Circuit \ncaselaw on contrary to law claims, namely the revised opinion in Global Health Council v. \nTrump, No. 25-5097, 2025 WL 2480618 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 28, 2025), which was not cited in its \nOrder. In that case, similarly involving federal grants, the D.C. Circuit allowed such contrary-to-\nlaw claims to proceed, finding it necessary to provide a “meaningful avenue to test the legality of \nthe Executive Branch’s unilateral action.” Order, Glob. Health Council, No. 25-5097, Doc. No. \n213525 at 8 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 28, 2025) (denying rehearing en banc) (Garcia Statement). \nFurther, regarding the arbitrary and capricious claims, the Court’s opinion does not \naddress several key distinctions to the Supreme Court’s recent decision in National Institutes of \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 9 of 14\nHealth v. American Public Health Association, which at the very least raise serious questions on \nthe merits.  Plaintiffs have thus established, at least, a serious issue of law meriting an injunction \npending appeal. \n1.  Plaintiffs’ claims that EPA’s action was contrary to law is expressly \npermitted by the D.C. Circuit \n \nThis Court’s opinion did not address Plaintiffs’ claims that terminating the Environmental \nand Climate Justice Block Grant program was contrary to law because it violated the \nConstitution and the Impoundment Control Act. Dkt. 98 (Mem. Opinion) at 14-19 (analyzing \ncontrary to law claims without discussing the Constitution or Impoundment Control Act).  These \nclaims were pled, and briefed, by Plaintiffs. Dkt. 1 at ¶ 205; Dkt. 29-1 at 20-24; Dkt. 77 at 20 -\n21. \nNotably in an opinion published the day before this Court’s order, the D.C. Circuit \namended its opinion in Global Health Council v. Trump, expressly leaving open contrary-to-law \nclaims that the Executive’s unilateral decision not to spend funds that Congress appropriated for \nspecific purposes is contrary to law—namely the appropriations acts—and thus violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act’s bar on agency actions that are contrary to law. Glob. Health \nCouncil, No. 25-5097, 2025 WL 2480618 at *11, n. 17 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 28, 2025).   \nMultiple judges emphasized the importance of amending the earlier opinion and allowing \nthis claim to proceed in their decision not to rehear the case en banc. See Order, Glob. Health \nCouncil, No. 25-5097, Doc. No. 213525 at 8 (D.C. Cir.  Aug. 28, 2025) (Garcia, J., joined by \nMillett, J., statement respecting the denial of rehearing en banc) (recognizing claim would \nprovide a “meaningful avenue to test the legality of the Executive Branch’s unilateral action” and \nthat the amended opinion “allows that claim to proceed”). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 10 of 14\n On remand, Judge Ali found that by withholding grant funds for policy reasons, the \nfederal government had violated the “bedrock expectation that Congress’s appropriations must \nbe followed” and thus that their decision not to spend the funds was contrary to law under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00402, 2025 WL \n2537200 at *12 (D.D.C. September 3, 2025).2 The Court's ruling omits any reference to the \namended opinion which raises a serious question on the merits on appeal. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and capricious claims are not barred by the Supreme \nCourt’s recent order \n \nFinally, this Court found that the Supreme Court’s recent orders in Department of \nEducation v. California (“California”) and National Institutes of Health v. American Public \nHealth Association (“NIH”) removed jurisdiction from federal district court for Plaintiffs’ \narbitrary and capricious claims. Dkt. 98 (Mem. Opinion) at 10-14. Not so.  \nIn NIH, the Supreme Court concluded that federal district courts have jurisdiction to \nreview and vacate unlawful policy-level decisions that involve grants – such as agency guidance \ndocuments. Nat. Instit. of Health v. Am. Pub. Health Ass’n, 145 S.Ct. 2658, 2661 (2025) (Barrett, \nJ.) (finding government not entitled to stay “insofar as they vacate the guidance documents”). As \nJustice Barrett explained, a challenge to an agency action that involves “policies related to \ngrants” should not be transformed “into a claim ‘founded … upon’ contract that only the [Court \nof Federal Claims] can hear.” Id. Accordingly, challenges to program-wide policy decisions that \nresult in grant terminations, like the decision here, can be heard in federal district court. \n \n2 The United States has applied for a stay of this decision with the United States Supreme Court.  \nOn Sept. 9, 2025, the Supreme Court entered a partial stay and ordered briefing on the \napplication. Dep’t of State v. Aids Vaccine Advoc. Coal., No. 25A269, 2025 WL 2601022 (Mem.) \n(Sept. 9, 2025). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-RJL     Document 101     Filed 09/16/25     Page 11 of 14\nThis Court overlooked the fact that Plaintiffs properly challenged the program-wide \ndecision to terminate the entire Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program, and \nonly sought restoration of individual grants as a natural consequence of vacatur and remand – \nstandard Administrative Procedure Act relief.  Notably, in Bowen, the Supreme Court recognized \nthat following vacatur of the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ decision to refuse to \nreimburse certain funds, the Government would likely “abide by [the court’s] declaration and pay \nMassachusetts the requested sum” concluding that this “mere byproduct” of the payment of \nmoney did not remove jurisdiction from federal district courts. Bowen v. Mass., 487 U.S. 879, \n909–10 (1988). \nContrary to this Court’s assertion that Plaintiffs engaged in artful pleading “by mounting \na programmatic challenge,” Plaintiffs properly challenged a high-level policy decision by the \nExecutive Branch to countermand Congress and terminate mandated, lawful, appropriations.  \nAnd the Supreme Court in NIH squarely held that such challenges belong in federal district \ncourt. Thus, Plaintiffs have established a serious question of law regarding their arbitrary and \ncapricious claims. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion and enter an injunction \nprohibiting EPA from treating as rescinded any funds appropriated by Congress for \nEnvironmental and Climate Justice Block Grants through Section 138 of the Clean Air Act (42 \nU.S.C. § 7438) and returning those funds to the Treasury during the pendency of the appeal.   \n \n  Dated: September 16, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n  /s/ Ben Grillot \n  Ben Grillot (D.C.

In February 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), under direction from \nPresident Trump, began to eliminate the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant \nprogram—a program Congress created and funded by specific appropriations as part of the \nInflation Reduction Act (“IRA”).  \n2. Over the next several weeks and months, EPA continued to eliminate the program, without \nany assessment of the consequences of its actions, and without any attempt to otherwise execute \nCongress’s directive or administer its appropriations. \n3. EPA’s termination of the program is unlawful. It violates bedrock separation-of-powers \nprinciples by effectively repealing a congressional enactment and impounding funds based on \nnothing more than the President’s disagreement with policies Congress duly enacted.  \n4. Further, it represents textbook arbitrary and capricious agency action by failing to engage \nin reasoned decision-making, ignoring important aspects of the problem—including the reliance \ninterests of hundreds of entities impacted, ignoring potential alternatives, and relying on \nconsiderations Congress did not allow.  \n5. When Congress enacted the IRA in 2022, it amended the Clean Air Act to include the \nEnvironmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program.  \n6. Congress did so for a simple reason: it wanted to ensure that the benefits of its investments \nwould flow to “disadvantaged communities”—those that face the greatest impacts from pollution \nand environmental degradation and have historically had little voice in the decision-making \nprocesses that affect them. 42 U.S.C. § 7438(b)(1).  \n7. Congress knew that individual communities would best know what programs and \nresources they most urgently needed. So, building on a block-grant model first developed by the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 5 of 48\nNixon Administration, Congress designated a set of activities—including community-led air \nmonitoring, climate resilience and adaptation projects, and workforce development projects to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions—that would be eligible for grant funding. Id. § 7438(b)(2).  \n8. Congress explicitly required EPA to award this grant funding directly to disadvantaged \ncommunities—through community-based nonprofit organizations, Indian Tribes, local \ngovernments, and institutions of higher education that proposed to carry out eligible activities \ntailored to those communities’ needs. Id. § 7438(b)(3). \n9. Congress appropriated $3 billion of federal funding specifically to fund these activities. Id. \n§ 7438(a). To effectuate Congress’s mandate, EPA developed, as relevant here, four grant \nprograms and a technical assistance program, and began a competitive grant-awarding process. \n10. EPA reviewed thousands of applications, assessed their merit under strict criteria, \nselected the best ones, and awarded grants.  \n11. On the ground, hundreds of grantees, including Plaintiffs and proposed class members, \ngot to work to improve their communities. They began to administer the grant programs they had \ncommitted to, and they received periodic reimbursement from EPA.   \n12. All this work came to a halt once President Trump entered office. On January 20, 2025, \nthe President issued an executive order directing federal agencies to stop disbursement of all \nfunds under the Inflation Reduction Act, including the grant funds at issue here. Unleashing \nAmerican Energy, Exec. Order No. 14,154 (Jan. 20, 2025), 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8357 (Jan. 29, \n2025) (“Energy EO”). He also mandated the termination of all “equity-related” grants or \ncontracts within 60 days. Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and \nPreferencing, Exec. Order No. 14,151 (Jan. 20, 2025), 90 Fed. Reg. 8339, 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025) \n(“Anti-Equity EO”). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 6 of 48\n13. EPA then began implementing these executive orders. It first froze all grant funding \nauthorized under the Inflation Reduction Act, then moved to terminate the Environmental and \nClimate Justice Block Grant program—and all grants providing technical assistance for those \ngrant applications. Ex. 1-A at ¶¶ 3–6; Ex. 1-B at ¶¶ 5–6; Ex. 1-C. \n14. EPA terminated the grants en masse. As the agency has since admitted, it did not review \nindividual grants—but rather reviewed “grant programs” and terminated them “for policy \nreasons” without distinguishing among grant recipients or activities. Ex. 1-A at ¶ 3; see also Ex. \n1-C at 1–2; Ex. 1-D; Ex. 1-E ¶¶ 13-17. Instead, EPA made broad program-level decisions and \nsent out substantively identical termination notices to all grantees. Ex. 1-G; Ex. 1-I; Ex. 1-J. \n15. Plaintiffs and proposed class members are the community-based nonprofit organizations, \nTribes, local governments, and higher education institutions that EPA selected to receive those \ngrants.  \n16. EPA’s unlawful termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant \nprogram thwarts Congress’s mandate and has harmed and continues to harm Plaintiffs and \nproposed class members—as well as communities across the country—who are now unable to \naddress environmental harms through these community-driven environmental, climate, and \npublic health projects.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.

Plaintiffs have all been directly harmed by EPA’s unlawful actions. Due to the \ntermination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program, Plaintiffs have been \nforced to lay off employees and cut essential programs.  \n46. For example, Plaintiff Deep South Center for Environmental Justice laid off three full-\ntime employees and two contractors while Plaintiff Parks Alliance of Louisville terminated a \nPark Superintendent after losing its EJCPS grant. The Institute for Sustainable Communities has \nfurloughed or laid off nearly 50% of its workforce due to the termination of its grant and the \nCEO of the Lowcountry Alliance for Model Communities is working without pay to prevent \nlayoffs. \n47. Further, Plaintiffs have suffered reputational harms—including a loss of goodwill and \nerosion of trust within their communities from having to break promises based on the expectation \nof continued federal support. Plaintiffs have had to cancel contracts, direct subawardees to stop \nwork, and communicate to the public that they can no longer launch or continue their urgently \nneeded projects.  \n48. These harms are redressable through a favorable decision. Granting Plaintiffs and \nproposed class members the relief sought here will allow them to continue work on their \nawarded grant projects and improve the health, safety, and resilience of frontline communities \nacross the country. \n \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 13 of 48\nDefendants \n49. Defendant EPA is an independent agency in the executive branch of the United States \ngovernment. See 5 U.S.C. § 552; Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, 84 Stat. 2086 (July 9, \n1970).  \n50.

In 2022, when Congress enacted the IRA, it made substantial federal investments in \ncutting-edge clean energy technology, lower energy costs, and mitigating the impacts of \ngreenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution.  \n57. Congress intended these funds to support communities across the country, prioritizing \nthose that have long borne the brunt of environmental and health harms.  \n58. As part of the IRA, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to create a new program for \n“Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants.” Pub. L. No. 117-169 § 60201, 136 Stat. \n1818, 2078 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 7438).  \n59. Using a block grant model first developed under the Nixon Administration, Congress \nappropriated $2.8 billion to EPA for projects to directly benefit communities across the country.  \n60. Recognizing that some communities most in need of assistance might lack the expertise \nto apply for and implement their projects, Congress appropriated another $200 million for \ntechnical assistance to support grant recipients in designing projects, preparing applications, and \nperforming on their grants. 42 U.S.C. § 7438(a)(2).  \n61. Further, Congress required EPA to “reserve 7 percent” of these amounts for \nadministrative costs to “carry out” these projects. Id. § 7438(c). \n62. To ensure that these grants benefited those most impacted by pollution and environmental \nharms, Congress instructed that the EPA Administrator “shall” use these funds “to award grants \nfor periods of up to 3 years to eligible entities to carry out [certain specified] activities . . . that \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 15 of 48\nbenefit disadvantaged communities,” id. § 7438(b)(1) (emphasis added), such as “community-led \nair and other pollution monitoring, prevention, and remediation”; “mitigating climate and health \nrisks from urban heat islands, extreme heat, wood heater emissions, and wildfire events”; \n“climate resiliency and adaptation”; “reducing indoor toxics and indoor air pollution”; and \n“facilitating engagement of disadvantaged communities in State and Federal advisory groups, \nworkshops, rulemakings, and other public processes,” id. § 7438(b)(2).  \n63. This funding was directed to “community-based nonprofit organizations,” “a partnership \nof community-based nonprofit organizations,” or a partnership between such nonprofits and “an \nIndian tribe, a local government, or an institution of higher education.” Id. § 7438(b)(3).  \n64. EPA followed the congressional mandate established in 42 U.S.C. § 7438 and created \nfour grant programs and a technical assistance program.1  \n65. Grant projects in the four grant programs have a performance period of three years or \nless. Id. § 7438(b)(1). Grants for the technical assistance program last for five years.2 \n66. Plaintiffs and proposed class members are recipients of grants under one or more of these \nprograms. \nCommunity Change Grants \n67. Community Change Grants (“CCGs”) fund projects that enhance climate resiliency or \nadaptation, mitigate climate and health risks, engage in community-led air and water pollution \n \n1 Inflation Reduction Act Environmental and Climate Justice Program, EPA (last updated Mar. \n27, 2025), https://perma.cc/3BKM-DR5D. Although EPA also created the UPLIFT Climate and \nEnvironmental Community Action Grant program, no grants were awarded under that program. \nId.  \n2 FAQs – EJ Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers Program (EJ TCTAC) at 1, EPA \n(Oct. 2022), https://perma.cc/4QLC-SSY9. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 16 of 48\nmonitoring, or develop a workforce that supports greenhouse gas reduction in disadvantaged \ncommunities most burdened by these environmental and health harms.3 \n68. To ensure meaningful community engagement, these grants are structured as partnerships \nbetween two community-based nonprofits, or between a community-based nonprofit and a \nfederally recognized Tribe, a local government as defined in 2 C.F.R. § 200.1, or an institution of \nhigher education.4  \n69. Prior to applying for a CCG, the Lead Applicant and its Statutory Partner must enter into \na partnership agreement. If the application is selected for award, the Lead Applicant must enter \ninto a subaward with the Statutory Partner to perform the promised elements of the project.5 \n70. Following Congress’s direction, EPA established a competitive bidding process that \ncalled on applicants to submit grant proposals. EPA selected 105 recipients from 2,700 \napplications and awarded a total of nearly $1.6 billion to those proposals the agency judged best \nable to carry out Congress’s mandate.  \n71. The following Plaintiffs and proposed class representatives received Community Change \nGrants: 2°C Mississippi, Air Alliance Houston, Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Kalamazoo \nCounty, the Native Village of Kipnuk, Landforce, PUSH Buffalo, Southwest Renewal \nFoundation, Springfield, TIMMA, and WE ACT for Environmental Justice.  \n72. Plaintiffs’ Community Change Grants funded projects to develop community resilience \nhubs, workforce development programs, community education projects, and air quality \nmonitoring, as well as to address high energy costs, among other initiatives. \n \n3 Frequently Asked Questions: Community Change Grants Program 2, EPA (Aug. 2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/AGH2-X245. \n4 Id. at 1.  \n5 Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants Program Notice of Funding \nOpportunity (NOFO), EPA (Oct. 3 2024), https://perma.cc/HB8N-84N2. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 17 of 48\n73. For example, as part of its Climate Action Plan, Kalamazoo County’s project included \ndeveloping climate resiliency hubs and an associated training program for disaster preparedness \nand ensuring safe and energy-efficient housing through home energy audits, home weatherization \nupgrades, and deployment of air quality monitors. The project was designed to benefit low-\nincome, pollution-burdened, and climate-insecure communities, where housing stock with lead \npipes, poor weatherization, and other flaws has contributed to air toxicity and high rates of \nasthma and cardiovascular disease. \n74. Air Alliance Houston was awarded a Community Change Grant to create or expand a \npermit engagement project in ten Texas counties. The project involved the development of tools, \ntrainings, and technical assistance to help residents meaningfully contribute to highly technical \npermitting decisions for pollution sources in their neighborhoods by submitting comments and \nparticipating in permitting hearings.  \n75. The Native Village of Kipnuk was awarded a Community Change Grant to fund the \nKipnuk Riprap Riverbank Stabilization Project, which aims to prevent environmental and \ncultural catastrophe. As the permafrost thaws in the village, the once-frozen riverbank becomes \nsoft, and the erosion rate from the Kugkaktlik River accelerates. As of 2009, approximately 0.7 \nacres were lost each year, and the erosion rate has only increased since then. Kipnuk has already \nlost some of its critical infrastructure. Additional critical infrastructure—including the fuel \nheader and pump house, boardwalks, the village corporation store, wind turbines, and the bulk \nfuel tank farm—are now all at risk. The grant-funded Stabilization Project aimed to stabilize the \nriverbank by building a revetment—a structure to keep the riverbank from eroding. The project \nalso included removal of hazardous materials that pose a risk of contaminating the Kugkaktlik \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 18 of 48\nRiver, and local workforce development and training to enable construction and maintenance of \nthe revetment.  \nThriving Communities Grantmaking Program \n76. The Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program was designed to alleviate the burden \nof the federal grant process on small, resource-constrained community-based organizations.6 EPA \nselects Grantmakers, who then create their own subaward application process and distribute \nsubawards to community-based nonprofits, local governments, institutions of higher education, \nand Native American organizations planning to address environmental issues with assessment, \nplanning, or development activities.  \n77. Some Grantmakers were selected to award subawards only in one EPA Region \n(“Regional Grantmakers”), while others were selected to award subgrants nationally (“National \nGrantmakers”).7  \n78. EPA selected 11 Grantmakers and awarded each up to $60 million.8 \n79. The Grantmakers received their EPA grants in two parts: an initial grant to set up their \nsubaward program and infrastructure, followed by a second installment for the subawards to \nlocal recipients.  \n80. EPA selected Plaintiffs and proposed class representatives HRiA and the Institute for \nSustainable Communities as Thriving Communities Grantmakers. \n \n6 Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking (TCGM) Program, EPA, \nhttps://perma.cc/UJ4P-2PNN. \n7 FAQs – The Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program (EJ TCGM) \nat 6, EPA Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights (June 2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/YCJ7-T2PJ. \n8 Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking (TCGM) Program, EPA, \nhttps://perma.cc/L54N-QTY3. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 19 of 48\n81. HRiA was chosen as a Grantmaker for EPA Region 1.9 As a Regional Grantmaker, HRiA \nawarded subgrants to local Tribes and community-based organizations in Region 1 to address \nlocal and regional needs such as flooding and stormwater planning, heat resilience, transportation \naccess, forever chemicals, and job training.  \n82. EPA selected Institute for Sustainable Communities as a National Grantmaker. Like \nHRiA, the Institute for Sustainable Communities awarded subgrants focused on building \ncapacity in communities. As a National Grantmaker, it awarded subgrants to more than 90 \nprojects across the country before EPA shut down the program. These included projects that \nreduce exposure to harmful air quality, train youth leaders in weather and its impact on \nagriculture and water quality, install wastewater treatment systems in rural communities lacking \nadequate wastewater management, and support the development of affordable, sustainable \nhousing. The funding for these projects is now on hold due to the disruption of the grant. \nEnvironmental Justice Collaborative Problem Solving Cooperative Agreements  \n83. Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem Solving Cooperative (“EJCPS”) \nAgreements are grants designed to fund organizations solving local environmental and public \nhealth problems through collaborative partnerships with other stakeholders, such as local \nbusinesses, industry, local government, medical service providers, and academic institutions.10   \n \n9 EPA has ten Regional offices, each of which is responsible for executing programs in specific \nstates and territories. The TCTAC for Region 1 serves local Tribes and community-based \norganizations in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and \nVermont. \n10 The Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program, EPA (last updated Mar. \n21, 2025), https://perma.cc/29EE-JLBE; see also Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly \n$1.6 Billion in Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants, EPA (Dec. 12, \n2024),https://perma.cc/8CU2-KPDE. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 20 of 48\n84. The Clean Air Act mandates that applicants be community-based organizations (or \npartnerships of such organizations) with grant projects addressing challenges like natural disaster \npreparedness and recovery, lack of access to healthy food, and water quality issues. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7438(b)(2), (b)(3). Qualifying work under these grants includes projects to develop health \nimpact assessments, emergency response plans, and economic revitalization initiatives.11 \n85. In fiscal year 2023, EPA awarded a total of $43.8 million in EJCPS Grants to 98 \nrecipients.12  \n86. Plaintiffs and proposed class representatives Appalachian Voices, 2°C Mississippi, \nDownwinders at Risk, HRiA, Lowcountry Alliance for Model Communities, Parks Alliance of \nLouisville, and Steelworks received EJCPS grants. Their ECJPS projects were designed to \nimprove natural disaster preparedness; mitigate flooding; provide access to low-cost renewable \nenergy, sustainable transportation, and workforce development opportunities; and improve \nindoor air quality in schools. \n87. For example, HRiA received EJCPS funding to develop and implement plans to improve \nindoor air quality in Massachusetts schools in districts where students are most burdened by \nasthma and extreme heat.  \n88. Appalachian Voices received EJCPS funding to implement shovel-ready infrastructure \nprojects in five economically depressed communities in rural Virginia suffering from the impacts \nof the decline of the coal industry. One flood-prone community in Pound, Virginia, planned to \nbuild a flood-mitigating riverwalk to prevent floodwaters from disturbing dilapidated buildings \nfull of mold and asbestos and thereby releasing these harmful substances into the air.  \n \n11 2023 Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem Solving (EJCPS) Program Project \nSummaries at 1, EPA, https://perma.cc/A2CR-52AJ. \n12 Id. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 21 of 48\n89. Because EPA terminated the grant, Appalachian Voices is unable to continue the project. \nPound cannot fund the project on its own: the town’s ability to bring in tax revenue has been so \ndiminished by economic decline that its ability to pay its bills is a continual struggle. \nGovernment-to-Government Program \n90. The Government-to-Government Program supports government activities that integrate \nenvironmental considerations into governmental decision-making and measurably improve \nenvironmental and public health.13 EPA awarded these grants to partnerships between \ncommunity organizations and either Tribes or local governments.14  \n91. In 2023, EPA awarded roughly $58 million of Government-to-Government Program \ngrants to approximately 62 local governments and Tribes, including Plaintiffs and proposed class \nrepresentatives Allegheny County, King County, Sacramento, and San Francisco.  \n92. Plaintiffs’ projects aimed to address challenges such as air quality, toxic pollution, water \nquality, food insecurity, affordable transportation access, and emergency preparedness.15 \n93. For example, King County’s project aimed to empower communities to take an active \nrole in improving housing and health outcomes, including by: (1) educating 2,300 frontline \ncommunity members, caregivers, and childcare providers on healthy homes and climate \nresilience, and (2) providing 700 homes and childcare providers with in-home assessments to \n \n13 The Environmental Justice Government-to-Government (EJG2G) Program, EPA, \nhttps://perma.cc/W9C5-9EKN.  \n14 While the Government-to-Government program also provides grants to states, states are not \n“eligible entities” for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 7438 funding; accordingly, those grants are not \nrelevant here. 42 U.S.C. § 7438(b)(3). \n15 2023 Environmental Justice Government-to-Government (EJG2G) Program Project \nSummaries, EPA, https://perma.cc/HDU9-Z3JW. \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 22 of 48\nidentify indoor air quality concerns and Healthy Homes Kits to support healthier indoor \nenvironments. \n94. San Francisco’s project aimed to engage communities that are most burdened by air \npollution levels and predominantly low-income to recommend and implement community-led \nclimate action to inform implementation of San Francisco’s 2021 Climate Action Plan. Through \npartnerships with community-based organizations, the project would increase communities’ \ncapacity to understand and act on climate change; improve government response and services; \nimprove health outcomes; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in local communities. Such \ncommunity partnership is essential to the success of San Francisco’s 2021 Climate Action Plan, \nwhich aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. \nThriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers \n95. In partnership with the Department of Energy, EPA created the Environmental Justice \nThriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers (“TCTACs”) to support the Thriving \nCommunities Grantmaking Program, among other grant programs. TCTACs assist under \nresourced communities with identifying grant funding sources, writing grant proposals, and \nmanaging federal grants, including those authorized under 42 U.S.C. § 7438.16  \n96. EPA awarded $177 million to fund 18 TCTACs across the country. Id. \n97. Plaintiffs and proposed class representatives Deep South Center for Environmental \nJustice, Institute for Sustainable Communities, and WE Act for Environmental Justice were \ndesignated as TCTACs.  \n \n16 Biden-Harris Administration Announces $177 Million for 17 New Technical Assistance \nCenters Across the Nation to Help Communities Access Historic Investments to Advance \nEnvironmental Justice, EPA (Apr. 13, 2023), https://perma.cc/KT4B-YZ7E. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 23 of 48\n98. Deep South Center for Environmental Justice was designated the TCTAC for EPA \nRegions 4 and 6, which cover the Southeast and South Central United States. Prior to the \ntermination of the grant program, the Deep South Center for Environmental Justices Community \nInvestment Recover Center was serving approximately 70 grassroots partner organizations across \n13 states. \n99. The Institute for Sustainable Communities was designated as a national TCTAC and also \nserved as the interim TCTAC for EPA Region 1. As a national TCTAC, it supported both regional \nTCTACs and communities through training and developing centralized resources. Before its \naward was terminated, it had processed over 100 technical assistance requests from regional \nTCTACs.  \n100. WE ACT is the TCTAC for EPA Region 2 and entered into agreements with steering \ncommittee partners, a project consultant, and 18 subawardees. \nEPA’s Termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant Program  \n \nPresident Trump Issues Executive Orders Instructing EPA  \nto Terminate Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant Program \n \n101. Shortly after his inauguration, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an \nexecutive order declaring “that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the \nprinciples outlined in this section.” Unleashing American Energy, Exec. Order No. 14,154 (Jan. \n20, 2025), 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8354 (Jan. 29, 2025) (“Energy EO”) at § 2 (emphasis added).  \n102. Section 7 of the Energy EO, titled “Terminating the Green New Deal,” further provided \nthat:  \n[a]ll agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated \nthrough  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  of  2022  (Public  Law  117-169)  or  the \nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) . . . and shall review \ntheir processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 24 of 48\nother financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the \nlaw and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.  \n \nEnergy EO § 7 (emphases added), 90 Fed Reg. at 8354.  \n103. The Energy EO forbade the disbursement of any funds that the executive branch deems \ninconsistent with certain agency policies. Id.  \n104. The Energy EO cited no legal authority for its across-the-board freeze of \ncongressionally appropriated funds.  \n105. Also on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order directing federal \nagencies to “terminate . . . all . . . ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts” within sixty days, i.e., by \nMarch 21, 2025, among other directives. Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI \nPrograms and Preferencing, Exec. Order No. 14,151 (Jan. 20, 2025), 90 Fed. Reg. 8339, 8339 \n(Jan. 29, 2025) (“Anti-Equity EO”) at § 2(b) (emphasis added).  \n106. The Anti-Equity EO also instructed federal agencies to provide the director of OMB \nwith a list of all “Federal Grantees” who received Federal funding for “environmental justice” \nprograms, id. § 2(b)(ii)(C) and ordered agencies to “terminate” all “environmental justice” \noffices and positions, id. § 2(b)(i). \n107. The Anti-Equity EO did not define “equity-related” grants or “environmental justice.”  \n108. The Anti-Equity EO cited no legal authority to categorically terminate all “equity-\nrelated” grants and contracts.  \nEPA Terminates the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant Program \n109. EPA then began implementing these executive orders. On February 20, 2025, EPA \nAssistant Deputy Administrator Travis Voyles identified a set of certain “approved to cancel” \nEnvironmental and Climate Justice Block Grants as well as TCTACs as targets for termination. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 25 of 48\nEx. 1-C (T. Voyles Email re cancelling grants - Feb. 20, 2025). EPA terminated these grants \nshortly thereafter and identified the terminations as “taxpayer savings” in a press release.17 \n110. EPA then proceeded to cancel all Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants. On \nFebruary 25, 2025, Mr. Voyles conducted a review of EPA grant programs “for consistency with \nAgency policy priorities.”  Ex. 1-A ¶ 3 (T. Voyles Decl.). He did so based on the “Assistance \nNumber Listing” identifying entire grant programs. Id. \n111. Mr. Voyles then unilaterally—in the course of a single day—decided to terminate \nEnvironmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreements (CFDA 66.306); \nEnvironmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants (CFDA 66.616); Thriving \nCommunities Grants (CFDA 66.615); the Environmental Justice Government-to-Government \nProgram (66.312); and the TCTAC program (66.309) “for policy reasons.” Ex. 1-A ¶ 3 (T. Voyles \nDecl.); Ex. 1-F (D. Coogan Email to T. Voyles – Feb. 25, 2025).  \n112. This decision expanded on Mr. Voyles’ earlier instructions to staff  to “apply a broad \napproach and cancel them all [TCTACs] in the vein the program is inconsistent with \nAdministration priorities.” Ex. 1-C (T. Voyles Email re cancelling grants - Feb. 20, 2025). \n113. While this termination was in process, EPA put a “control” in the Automated System for \nAdministrative Payment (“ASAP”) system, and grantees could not draw down any funds. Ex. 1-\nH (G. Treml email re account hold – Mar. 7, 2025). EPA applied this control at the grant program \nlevel, meaning that the single “control” applied to all Environmental and Climate Justice Block \nGrants.  \n \n17 EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin Cancels 20 Grants in 2nd Round of Cuts with DOGE, Saving \nAmericans More than $60M, EPA (Feb. 25, 2025), https://perma.cc/KV5D-XK99. \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 26 of 48\n114. In February through May 2025, EPA sent form letters to grantees purporting to formally \nterminate the grants. EPA instructed its grant managers to terminate grants with a boilerplate \ntemplate response to each grantee. EPA directed grant managers to “Copy/paste email language \nfrom Grant Termination [memo]” and then attach a form termination letter to the email. Ex. 1-G \nat 2 (M. Wise email re termination procedure – Feb. 21, 2025); see also Ex. 1-I (EPA Grant \nTermination Standard Operating Procedure); Ex. 1-J (Boilerplate Termination Letter).  \n115. EPA has stated its intent to terminate all grants awarded to Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers under the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program for “policy \nreasons.” Ex. 1-A ¶ 3 (T. Voyles Decl.); see also Ex. 1-B ¶¶ 5–6 (D. Coogan Decl.).  \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \nI.  Congress’s Legislative Authority \n \nA.  The Power of the Purse \n \n116. The United States Constitution grants Congress the power to make the laws of this \nnation. The Constitution provides that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \nCongress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 1.  \n117. Congress’s lawmaking powers are at their apex on matters of federal funding. The \nConstitution grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President. See, e.g., Consumer \nFin. Prot. Bureau v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass’n of Am. Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 420 (2024); see also \nMem. from John G. Roberts, Jr. to Fred F. Fielding at 1 (Aug. 15, 1985), https://perma.cc/G5AA-\nGJAU (“[N]o area seems more clearly the province of Congress than the power of the purse.”).  \n118. This power is “exclusive” to Congress, which “has absolute control of the moneys of the \nUnited States” under our Constitution. Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. EPA, 960 F. 2d 180, 185 \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 27 of 48\n(D.C. Cir. 1992) (citation and quotations omitted). “Any exercise of a power granted by the \nConstitution to one of the other branches of Government is limited by a valid reservation of \ncongressional control over funds in the Treasury.” Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. \n414, 425 (1990).  \n119. Congress’s power over the purse is rooted in two constitutional provisions. The \nAppropriations Clause provides that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \nConsequence of Appropriations made by Law.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. The Appropriations \nClause expressly “was intended as a restriction upon the disbursing authority of the Executive \ndepartment.” Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321 (1937).  \n120. The Spending Clause provides that “Congress shall have Power To lay and collect \nTaxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and \ngeneral Welfare of the United States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  \n121. Through these multiple grants of authority, the Constitution gives Congress broad power \nto legislate spending and to decide how and when its appropriations are spent. See South Dakota \nv. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987).  \n122. When Congress passes a law appropriating money for a particular purpose, the President \nmust spend that money for that purpose. This duty stems from the Take Care Clause, which states \nthat the President “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; \nsee Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 327 (2014) (“Under our system of government, \nCongress makes laws and the President . . . ‘faithfully execute[s]’ them.”).  \n123. “[A] President sometimes has policy reasons . . . for wanting to spend less than the full \namount appropriated by Congress for a particular project or program. But in those circumstances, \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 28 of 48\neven the President does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend the funds.” In re Aiken \nCnty., 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J.).  \n124. If a President disagrees with Congress’s spending decision, he can veto the legislation; \nbut once a spending law has passed, the executive branch must spend the money on the terms \nCongress has provided. See Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 40–44 (1975).  \n125. The executive branch has no constitutional power to amend or repeal statutes, Clinton v. \nCity of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) and doubly lacks the power to supplant Congress’s \nspending directives with his own.  \n126. When the executive branch intrudes on Congress’s power over the purse, it violates the \nseparation of powers. “Congress’s power of the purse is the ultimate check on the otherwise \nunbounded power of the Executive,” U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell, 130 F. Supp. 3d \n53, 76 (D.D.C. 2015), and acts as a “bulwark of the Constitution’s separation of powers,” U.S. \nDep’t of Navy v. Fed. Labor Rel. Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Allowing the \nExecutive to usurp this power “would be clothing the President with a power entirely to control \nthe legislation of congress, and paralyze the administration of justice.” Kendall v. U.S. ex rel. \nStokes, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838).  \n127. “Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the \nseparation of powers.” Clinton, 524 U.S. at 450 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Nowhere is this more \napparent than when a President attempts to unilaterally seize the Nation’s purse strings and \nnullify a congressional enactment to serve his policy goals.  \nB.  The Presentment Clauses  \n128. The Presentment Clauses form equally “integral parts of the constitutional design for the \nseparation of powers.” Immigr. & Naturalization Serv. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 946 (1983).  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 29 of 48\n129. These Clauses provide that “[e]very Bill which shall have passed the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of \nthe United States,” and that “before [a law] shall take Effect, [it] shall be approved by [the \nPresident], or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House \nof Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.” U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 7, cl. 2–3.  \n130. The Presentment Clauses grant the President “a limited and qualified power to nullify \nproposed legislation by veto.” Chadha, 462 U.S. at 947. This “finely wrought and exhaustively \nconsidered” constitutional procedure precludes by implication the President’s power “to enact, to \namend, or to repeal statutes” in any other way. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 438–39 (quoting Chadha, \n462 U.S. at 951).  \n131. The Constitution’s careful limitations on the President’s role in lawmaking are designed \nto protect the people from tyranny. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, \n633 (1952) (Douglas, J., concurring) (“The Framers with memories of the tyrannies produced by \na blending of executive and legislative power rejected that political arrangement.”).  \nC.  Jurisdiction over constitutional claims \n132. Federal district courts have jurisdiction over nonstatutory claims to enjoin federal \nofficials from acting unconstitutionally. See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., \n561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010); Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 \n(1949); see also Strickland v. United States, 32 F. 4th 311, 363-66 (4th Cir. 2022). These claims \narise when federal officials act “beyond the scope of their powers” and “in an unconstitutional \nmanner.” Strickland, 32 F.4th at 366.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 30 of 48\n133. Claims for nonstatutory review of constitutional infirmities are deeply rooted in the \nhistory of the judiciary. “Indeed, the most famous case of all, Marbury v. Madison, was a \nnonstatutory review case.” Jonathan R. Siegel, Suing the President: Nonstatutory Review \nRevisited, 97 Colum. L. Rev. 1612, 1625 (1997).  \n134. Where plaintiffs bring nonstatutory claims for injunctive or declaratory relief against \nfederal officials for alleged unconstitutional action, “sovereign immunity does not bar a suit.” \nChamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see also Widakuswara v. \nLake, No. 25-5144, 2025 WL 1521355 (D.C. Cir. May 28, 2025) (en banc) (adopting J. Pillard’s \ndissent in Widakusawara, 2025 WL 1288817).  \n135. Sovereign immunity does not bar such claims because actions that exceed constitutional \nauthority “are considered individual and not sovereign actions.” Strickland, 32 F. 4th at 366 \n(quoting Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949)). \n136. “[W]henever a separation-of-powers violation occurs, any aggrieved party with standing \nmay file a constitutional challenge.” Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 245 (2021). \n137. The Tucker Act does not confer jurisdiction over constitutional claims on the Court of \nFederal Claims unless they are based on constitutional provisions that create “a substantive right \nenforceable against the federal government for money damages.” LeBlanc v. United States, 50 \nF.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  \n138. Separation-of-powers and Presentment Clauses claims are not based on such provisions, \nand are not reviewable in the Court of Federal Claims. Id. \nII.  The Administrative Procedure Act \n139. Congress enacted the APA to ensure fairness and stability in agency action by \nmandating reasoned decision-making, and to guard against agencies’ pursuit of a political agenda \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 31 of 48\nwithout adherence to legal process. See United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 644 \n(1950) (describing the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might otherwise have \ncarried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices”); see also N.C. \nGrowers’ Ass’n, Inc. v. United Farm Workers, 702 F.3d 755, 772 (4th Cir. 2012) (Wilkinson, J., \nconcurring) (noting that the APA prohibits policy change based on “political winds and currents” \nwithout adherence to “law and legal process”). \n140. To effectuate these goals, the APA imposes both substantive and procedural constraints \non final agency action. See Cent. Tex. Tel. Coop., Inc. v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 402 F.3d 205, \n209 (D.C. Cir. 2005). As to the former, the APA requires courts to set aside agency action that is \n“not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nshort of statutory right,” or “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C).  \n141. The APA tasks courts––not the Executive––with “deciding whether an agency has acted \nwithin its statutory authority.” Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 412 (2024). This \nis because the APA “codifies” the “elemental proposition reflected by judicial practice dating \nback to Marbury,” that “courts, not agencies” decide what the law is. Id. at 371. \n142. As to process, the APA requires an agency to “acknowledge and explain” and show \n“good reasons” for changes in position. U.S. Telecom Ass’n v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 825 F.3d \n674, 706–07 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation and quotations omitted). \n143. To enforce these principles, the APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion,” or “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D).  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 32 of 48\n144. An agency fails to engage in “reasoned decisionmaking,” and its actions are arbitrary \nand capricious, when the agency “has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to \nconsider, [or] entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.” Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43, 52 (1983).  \n145. An agency must “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for \nits action,” id. at 43, “including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice \nmade,” Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 (2019) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. \nat 43). “This foundational precept of administrative law is especially important where, as here, \nan agency changes course.” Physicians for Soc. Resp. v. Wheeler, 956 F.3d 634, 644 (D.C. Cir. \n2020). \n146. When an agency is not writing on a “blank slate” but is “changing [its] position,” the \nagency must “provide a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy” if, \n“for example, . . . its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken \ninto account.” Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 \n(2009).  \n147. When changing policy, agencies must “assess whether there were reliance interests, \ndetermine whether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against competing policy \nconcerns.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 33 (2020). “[W]hen \nan agency rescinds a prior policy its reasoned analysis must [also] consider the alternatives that \nare within the ambit of the existing policy.” Id. at 30 (citation and quotations omitted).  \n148. At bottom, an agency must give “good reasons for the new policy,” Encino Motorcars, \nLLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 223 (2016) (citation and quotations omitted), including “a \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 33 of 48\nreasoned explanation . . . for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were \nengendered by the prior policy,” Fox, 556 U.S. at 515-16.  \n149. Section 702 of the APA waives sovereign immunity and vests jurisdiction over APA \nclaims for injunctive or declaratory relief in the federal district courts. 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n150. That waiver does not apply where another statute grants consent to suit explicitly or \nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought. Id. \n151. The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, does not grant consent to suit over claims for \nequitable relief, nor does it expressly or impliedly forbid federal district courts from granting that \nrelief.  See Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-5144, 2025 WL 1288817 at *13 (D.C. Cir. May 3, \n2025) (Pillard, J., dissenting),18 citing Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 905 (1988). \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  \n152. The allegations in the preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \nPlaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and as a class action, pursuant to Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2). \n153. Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class (the “proposed class”): \n \nAll entities that received awards from the EPA authorized in whole or in part by 42 \nU.S.C. § 7438 which EPA then terminated after January 20, 2025 (including statutory \npartners). The covered awards are Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving \nCooperative Agreements (CFDA 66.306); Environmental and Climate Justice \nCommunity Change Grants (CFDA 66.616); Thriving Communities Grantmaking Grants \n(CFDA 66.615); Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program awards \nawarded to non-State entities (CFDA 66.312), as well as awards to Thriving \nCommunities Technical Assistance Centers (CFDA 66.309).  \n \nThis class excludes the plaintiffs in Sustainability Institute v. Trump, No. 25-cv-2152-\nRMG (D.S.C.) or Green & Healthy Homes Initiative, Inc. v. EPA, No. 25-cv-01096 (D. \n \n18 Judge Pillard’s dissent in the Widakuswara panel decision was substantially adopted by the \nD.C. Circuit sitting en banc. Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-5144, 2025 WL 1521355, at *1 (D.C. \nCir. May 28, 2025) (denying stay pending appeal “substantially for the reasons explained by \nJudge Pillard.”).   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 34 of 48\nMd.) and excludes entities whose awards were expressly terminated for identified \nfinancial or performance failures. \n \n154. Plaintiffs reserve the right to modify or amend the class definition prior to the Court’s \ndetermination on certification. \n155. Certification of a class is appropriate where: “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of \nall members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the \nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; \nand (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). The disposition of the claims of all class members will provide substantial \nbenefits to all parties and the Court.  \nRule 23(a)(1) - Numerosity \n156. The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). Defendants terminated approximately 350 awards19 under these \nprograms to entities across the country. \nRule 23(a)(2) - Commonality \n157. The proposed class’s claims turn on common questions of fact or law that are capable of \nclasswide resolution. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). The legality of Defendants’ mass terminations \nis a common question capable of resolution in one stroke. The proposed class representatives \nseek common declaratory and injunctive relief concerning the legality of Defendants’ mass \ntermination actions, and relief mandating Defendants cease these constitutional and statutory \nviolations. \n158. Among the common questions of law and fact for the class are:  \n \n19 The exact number of proposed class members is readily identifiable and known to Defendants.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 35 of 48\na)  Whether EPA engaged in a course of conduct that unlawfully terminated the \nEnvironmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program under which class \nmembers received their grants;   \n \nb)  Whether EPA’s termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant \nprogram violated the Constitution’s Separation of Powers and Presentment \nClauses; \n  \nc)  Whether EPA’s termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant \nprogram violated the APA;  \n \nd)  Whether Plaintiffs and the other class members are entitled to injunctive and/or \ndeclaratory relief.  \nRule 23(a)(3) - Typicality \n159. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the proposed class as a whole. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(3). Each class member’s claim arises from the same course of events (Defendants’ \ntermination of the Environment and Climate Justice Block Grant program) and each class \nmember has experienced the same injury (the termination of their grants) if relief is denied.  \nRule 23(a)(4) - Adequacy \n160. Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the proposed class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(4). They are committed to seeking a declaration and injunction that will benefit all \nmembers of the proposed class equally by declaring their award terminations illegal and \nrestoring those awards and grant programs as they existed before the terminations. Plaintiffs are \naware of their obligations as class representatives and willing to dedicate time and effort to \nvigorously pursue this matter on behalf of every member of the proposed class.  \n161. Proposed class counsel have extensive relevant experience and are committed to \nzealously representing the proposed class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4), 23(g). Proposed class \ncounsel are attorneys from Southern Environmental Law Center, Public Rights Project, and \nEarthjustice with extensive complex civil litigation experience in administrative law, \nconstitutional law, and class actions, including work on IRA funding freezes and terminations in \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 36 of 48\nSustainability Institute et al. v. Trump et al., No. 25-cv-2152 (D.S.C.) and Cultivate KC et al. v. \nUSDA et al., No. 25-cv-00737 (D.D.C.), and extensive knowledge of both the details of \nDefendants’ unlawful actions and the relevant law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4), (g). Counsels’ \nrelevant qualifications are more fully set forth in the declarations to be filed with a forthcoming \nMotion for Class Certification and its accompanying memorandum and exhibits.  \n162. The combined efforts of counsel and proposed class counsel have included significant \ntime and resources helping disadvantaged communities obtain IRA and IIJA federal funding for \nclimate resilience, clean energy and climate justice projects, and securing access to clean, \naffordable drinking water.  \n163. Since January 2025, counsel and proposed class counsel have investigated and \nchallenged unlawful grant freezes, disruptions, and terminations. This work has included \nproviding legal and technical guidance to affected grantees, and engaging in consultations with \ncoalitions, stakeholders, attorneys, and national experts working to address these funding \ndisruptions. \n164. Proposed class counsel have devoted significant time and resources to becoming \nknowledgeable about Defendants’ unlawful grant freeze and termination practices.  \nRule 23(b)(2) \n165. Certification of the proposed class is appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(2) because Defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to the class when they \nterminated the grant programs en masse, for the same purported policy reasons. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2). EPA’s actions violate the Constitution and the APA in the same way for all class \nmembers. Accordingly, injunctive and declaratory relief are appropriate for the class as a whole. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 37 of 48\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Separation of Powers  \n166. The allegations in the preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n167. “[W]henever a separation-of-powers violation occurs, any aggrieved party with standing \nmay file a constitutional challenge.” Collins, 594 U.S. at 245.  \n168. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the President, exclusive power over the \nnation’s purse and the power to legislate. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7; art. I, § 8, cl. 1; art. I, § 1.  \n169. When Congress appropriates funds for a specified purpose, the President has a duty to \nspend those funds on the terms set by Congress. See U.S. Const. art. II, § 3 (Take Care Clause).  \n170. The President has no constitutional power to terminate funds appropriated by Congress, \nparticularly when the termination is based on Presidential policies rather than Congress’s \nspending directives. See, e.g., City & County of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231–35 \n(9th Cir. 2018).  \n171. Congress has enacted the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program \nunder the IRA and Clean Air Act and appropriated $3 billion in funding for those programs to \nserve enumerated purposes specified in these statutory programs. 42 U.S.C. § 7438. \n172. Consistent with its constitutional and statutory duties, EPA obligated these funds to \nspecific entities via a rigorous, regulated, and competitive grantmaking process.   \n173. Defendants are constitutionally required to carry out these congressionally mandated \nprograms, and to obligate and distribute the funds that Congress appropriated for these programs.  \n174. EPA terminated these entire grant programs en masse for “policy reasons.” Ex. 1-A  ¶ 3 \n(T. Voyles Decl.). \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 38 of 48\n175. EPA’s decision to terminate the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant \nprogram contravenes Congress’s directives in the Clean Air Act as amended by the IRA to fund \nthe statutory programs at issue in this case. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 7438(b)(1) (directing that EPA \n“shall” award grants for certain activities “that benefit disadvantaged communities”).  \n176. EPA did not identify any statutory, regulatory, or constitutional authority to terminate \ncongressionally appropriated funds based on the President’s policy preferences.  \n177. Indeed, the President’s policy preferences as articulated in the Anti-Equity EO  conflict \nwith the very purposes for which Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block \nGrants—namely to “benefit disadvantaged communities” and advance “environmental and \nclimate justice.” \n178. All the relevant constitutional powers here––the powers to appropriate, spend, and \nlegislate––belong solely to Congress. The President has no constitutional power to unilaterally \nwithhold funds appropriated by Congress, much less based on policies that conflict with what \nCongress specified.  \n179. EPA’s decision to terminate the grant programs authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 7438 violates \nCongress’s spending power, see U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause), art. I, § 9, cl. 7 \n(Appropriations Clause), and Congress’s power to legislate, see U.S. Const. art. I, § 1 \n(Legislative Power), and thus violates the separation of powers.  \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the Presentment Clauses  \n180. The allegations in the preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n181. The Presentment Clauses limit the President’s role in lawmaking to vetoing an “entire \nbill . . . before the bill becomes law.” Clinton, 524 U.S. at 439. “Presidential action that either \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 39 of 48\nrepeals or amends parts of duly enacted statutes” violates the Presentment Clauses. Id. (emphasis \nadded).  \n182. EPA’s termination of the grant programs mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 7438 violates the \nPresentment Clauses because it seeks to “terminat[e]” parts of the IRA after they were passed by \nCongress and signed by the President. See Energy EO § 7; Anti-Equity EO § 2(b)(i).  \n183. In purpose and in effect, EPA’s termination of grant programs required by 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7438 unlawfully amends the spending provisions of the IRA by ending grant programs \nmandated by Congress, based on presidential policies that are wholly different than Congress’s \ndirectives for the funds and programs. See supra ¶¶ 109-115.  \n184. By cancelling Congress’s spending directives and replacing them with the President’s \npolicy preference to withhold appropriated funds, EPA’s termination of the grant programs \nauthorized by 42 U.S.C. § 7438 seeks to repeal that section and amend the IRA in violation of \nthe Presentment Clauses. See U.S. Const. Art. I, § 7, cl. 2–3.  \n185. For these reasons, EPA’s termination of the grant programs authorized by 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7438 violates the Presentment Clauses.  \nCOUNT III  \nViolation of the APA – Arbitrary and Capricious  \n186. The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n187. The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 40 of 48\n188. EPA’s termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program for \npolicy reasons, and each subsequent termination of Plaintiffs’ grants and TCTACs, are final \nagency actions subject to review under the APA.   \n189. EPA’s termination of the grant programs, and its subsequent termination of all grants, is \narbitrary and capricious for multiple reasons.  \n190. First, EPA terminated grant programs for which Congress had appropriated $3 billion \nunder the IRA without engaging in a “reasoned analysis” for the terminations as the APA \nrequires. State Farm, 463 U.S. at 57.  EPA has not provided an explanation as to why terminating \nthe entire Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program was necessary to effectuate \nthe Administration’s general “policy priorities.” \n191. Second, EPA terminated the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program \nwithout consideration of “an important aspect of the problem.”  Id. at 43. Specifically, EPA failed \nto consider the “serious reliance interests” of Plaintiffs and proposed class members of the class \non those funds. Fox, 556 U.S. at 515. EPA also failed to consider the consequences of suddenly \ncutting funding to hundreds of nonprofits, Tribes, local governments, universities and the \ncommunities they serve. \n192. Instead, EPA “cut the fuel supply to a vast, complicated, nationwide machine—\nseemingly without any consideration for the consequences of that decision.” Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. and Budget, 763 F. Supp. 3d 36, 55 (D.D.C. 2025). To say that EPA \n“‘failed to consider an important aspect of the problem’ would be putting it mildly.” Id.  \n193. Third, EPA’s decision to terminate the grant programs authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 7438 \nrelies “on factors which Congress has not intended [EPA] to consider.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 41 of 48\n43. Specifically, this action terminated funds based on the agency’s policies, contrary to \nCongress’s specific directives and purposes for appropriating funds in the IRA.  \n194. Fourth, EPA failed to consider how the wholesale termination of the Environmental and \nClimate Justice Block Grant program would impact the “primary goal[s]” of Clean Air Act \nSection 138. Nat’l Lifeline Ass’n v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 921 F.3d 1102, 1111, 1115 (D.C. \nCir. 2019) (finding agency action arbitrary and capricious where it failed to “consider the impact \nof the change on [the agency program’s] ‘primary purpose’ or otherwise explain how it is \ncompatible with that purpose”).  \n195. The unexplained termination of these grant funds epitomizes agency action by “whim \nand caprice of the bureaucracy.” N.C. Growers’ Ass’n, 702 F.3d at 772 (Wilkinson, J., \nconcurring).  \n196. EPA’s actions that terminated the grant programs authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 7438 and its \nsubsequent termination of all grants must be vacated as arbitrary and capricious under the APA. 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \nCOUNT IV \n \nViolation of the APA – Contrary to Law  \n \n197. The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n198. The APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations,” or “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C).  \n199. “Courts”––not the Executive––“must exercise their independent judgment in deciding \nwhether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, as the APA requires.” Loper Bright, \n603 U.S. at 412.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 42 of 48\n200. For four reasons, EPA’s termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block \nGrant program is outside of the agency’s statutory authority, contrary to law, and without \nobservance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C). These agency actions must \nbe held unlawful and vacated under the APA. Id. § 706(2).  \n201. First, EPA’s termination of the grant programs is outside of its statutory authority. Id. \n§ 706(2)(C). No federal law or regulation gives EPA the power to terminate funding appropriated \nby Congress and obligated by executive agencies. The executive branch has terminated these \ngrant programs based on policies that are entirely different than, and in many cases directly in \nconflict with, the directives and purposes specified by Congress for expending the funds.  \n202. By refusing to expend appropriated funds based on the President’s priorities rather than \n“stated statutory factors,” the “Executive has acted contrary to law and in violation of the APA.” \nNew York, 2025 WL 357368, at *2.     \n203. Second, these agency actions are unconstitutional on the grounds set forth in Counts I–II \nand are thus “not in accordance with law” and “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \nor immunity” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (B).  \n204. Third, these agency actions are “not in accordance with” the Clean Air Act, as amended \nby the IRA, 42 U.S.C. § 7438(b)(1), which appropriated money to the grant programs at issue \nhere. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Defendants’ actions are not in accordance with the statutory \nrequirements to create, fund, and carry out these programs. See 42 U.S.C. § 7438(b)(1) (directing \nthat EPA “shall” award grants for certain activities “that benefit disadvantaged communities” and \nenumerating specific categories of eligible activities and eligible recipients). \n205. Fourth, these agency actions are “not in accordance with” the Impoundment Control Act \nof 1974 (“ICA”). 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see 2 U.S.C. § 683. By terminating the grant programs \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 43 of 48\nand individual grants, Defendants have unlawfully withheld the expenditure of funds. \nDefendants initially deferred the funds for impermissible policy reasons and without following \nthe ICA’s requirements for notifying Congress, and then unilaterally rescinded the funds, \ncontravening the ICA’s requirement that should the President seek such a rescission, he must \nrequest it of Congress and Congress must act to rescind the funds. 2 U.S.C. § 683(b).   \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the APA – Contrary to Law  \nDe-Obligation of All Environment and Climate Justice Block Grants \n206. The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n207. In enacting the federal grant programs at issue in this case, Congress mandated that $3 \nbillion in funding for those programs be obligated to serve enumerated purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7438(a), (b)(2). \n208. In recognition of Congress’s instruction, EPA issued programmatic terms for the grant \nprograms that recognize the requirement to fully obligate the funds that Congress appropriated \nfor the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program.  \n209. For example, the Community Change Grant Program terms stipulate that if EPA de-\nobligates any awarded funds it must “re-obligate them by an award to another Community \nChange Grant recipient receiving an award pursuant to Notice of Funding Opportunity EPA-R-\nOEJECR-OCS-23-04 to effectuate the objectives of Section 138 of the Clean Air Act, 42 USC \n§ 7438 within 90 days of the de-obligation.” Ex. 1-K at 16 (Community Change Grant \nProgrammatic Terms and Conditions). \n210. Yet EPA’s termination of the grant programs at issue here includes no effort to comply \nwith Congress’s requirement that the funds remain obligated to the Environmental and Climate \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 44 of 48\nJustice Block Grant program. Instead, EPA viewed these terminations as “immediate taxpayer \nsavings,” evidencing its intent to specifically not obligate the funds.20 \n211. Contrary to Congress’s instruction, upon information and belief, EPA now seeks to de-\nobligate the entirety of the remaining appropriated funds without any provision for the funds to \nbe re-obligated.  \n212. For the reasons set forth above, EPA’s termination of the Environmental and Climate \nJustice Block Grants violates the Constitution; the Clean Air Act, as amended by the IRA; and \nthe Impoundment Control Act. It also violates Congress’s express instruction that the \nappropriated funds be obligated. \n213. EPA’s termination of the grant programs authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 7438 and intention \nto de-obligate the previously awarded funds is in excess of the agency’s statutory authority, \nunconstitutional, and not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C). These agency \nactions must be held unlawful and vacated under the APA. Id. § 706(2).      \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  Certify this class as a Class Action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2); \nB.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the termination of grant programs mandated by Section \n138 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7438, and the termination of legally-obligated grant \nawards issued under those programs violate the United States Constitution and the APA, \n5 U.S.C. § 706; \n \n20 EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin Cancels 400+ Grants in 4th Round of Cuts with DOGE, Saving \nAmericans More than $1.7B, EPA (Mar. 10, 2025), https://perma.cc/6FSC-GKFJ. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01982-PLF     Document 1     Filed 06/25/25     Page 45 of 48\nC.

Preliminarily and permanently enjoin EPA from taking action to terminate grant programs \nauthorized by Section 138 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7438; \nE.

Require EPA to make adequate staffing and other resources available to effectuate the \ngrant programs mandated by Section 138 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7438; \nG.  Require EPA to extend the period of performance to allow Plaintiffs and class members to \ncomplete the period of performance specified in their grant agreements, accounting for \nthe time between the time they lost access to their grant funding and this Court’s order; \nH.  Retain jurisdiction over this matter to ensure compliance with the above relief;  \nI.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable fees, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, in \naccordance with law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412; and \nJ.
