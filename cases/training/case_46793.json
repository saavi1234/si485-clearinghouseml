    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump Administration's purported termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a comprehensive pre-disaster mitigation initiative administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that provided technical and financial assistance to states and local governments for cost-effective, pre-disaster hazard mitigation measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 16, 2025, several states filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against FEMA and its Senior Official; the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its Secretary; and the United States of America. They alleged that defendants' actions violated the separation of powers, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Appropriations Clause, the Spending Clause, the Appointments Clause, and were ultra vires. In particular, the plaintiff states argued that BRIC's purported termination was unlawful for three reasons. First, that it was contrary to Congress' express commands to prioritize and fund disaster mitigation; second, that defendants unconstitutionally intruded on the congressional power of the purse; and finally, that FEMA's successive heads were not lawfully appointed to lead FEMA and thus acted beyond any legal authority in purporting to terminate the program. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including vacatur of the purported termination of BRIC, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Richard Gaylore Stearns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also on July 16, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held a hearing on the motion on July 31, 2025, and on August 5, 2025 it granted the motion and preliminarily enjoined defendants from spending the funds allocated to BRIC for non-BRIC purposes until the court rendered a final judgment on the merits. 2025 WL 2229394. It reasoned that despite defendants' equivocation about whether they had, in fact, ended BRIC, the states had provided evidence of steps taken by FEMA to terminate the program, including cancelling new funding opportunities and reallocating funds, that \"portend[ed] the conclusion that a determination has in fact been made and that FEMA is inching towards a <em>fait accompli</em>.\"&nbsp; Therefore, and because the claimed harm was likely imminent, plaintiffs' claims were ripe for review and the plaintiff states had standing to bring them. The court rejected defendants' assertion of sovereign immunity, reasoning that the states' claims were premised on FEMA acting absent discretion and thus fell outside the scope of immunity.&nbsp; Ultimately, in granting preliminary relief, the court concluded that it was not convinced that Congress had vested in FEMA the power to reallocate funds away from BRIC and that the funds, if spent on other purposes during the pendency of the lawsuit, would be lost forever, causing hardship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

In  a  nine-count \nComplaint, the States accuse the Government of violating the Administrative \nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(A)-(C), and several clauses of the U.S. \nConstitution.  Before the court now is the States’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  On July 31, 2025, the court convened a hearing on the motion.  \nFor  the  following  reasons,  the  court  will  allow  the  States’  motion  in \nsubstance. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nThe  BRIC  program  provides  “technical  and  financial  assistance  to \nStates  and  local  governments  for  cost-effective  pre-disaster  hazard \nmitigation  measures  that  reduce  injuries,  loss  of  life,  and  damage  and \ndestruction of property.”  Richardson Decl. [Dkt # 76] ¶ 4.  It is funded \nthrough direct Congressional appropriations, see Infrastructure Investment \nand Jobs Act (IIJA), Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat, 429 (2021), and through set \nasides from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), see Stafford Act § 203(i), 42 \nU.S.C. § 5133(i).  \nOn  April  2,  2025,  Cameron  Hamilton,  the  then-Senior  Official \nPerforming the Duties of the Administrator of FEMA, issued a memorandum \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 3 of 15\npurporting to “provid[e] new direction for the BRIC Program.”  Hamilton \nMemo [Dkt # 9-6].  Among other changes, the memorandum specified that \nFEMA: (1) “will cancel the FY24 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for \nthe BRIC grant program,” (2) “will [n]ot award the BRIC projects selected \nbut not yet awarded across all fiscal years,” and (3) “will . . . [n]ot grant any \nadditional period of performance extensions on any BRIC projects, without \n[Hamilton’s] prior approval.”  Id.   \nTwo days later, on April 4, 2025, Hamilton announced the changes to \nthe public, issuing a press release stating that “FEMA is ending the [BRIC] \nprogram” and “will . . . immediately return[]” any funds which had not yet \nbeen distributed “either to the Disaster Relief Fund or the U.S. Treasury.”  \nApril 4 Press Release [Dkt # 9-7].  The Deputy Regional Administrator for \nFEMA Region 1 viewed this press release as “announc[ing] the cancellation \nof the [BRIC] program,” Brantley Decl. [Dkt # 72-1], Ex. A, and, on April 7, \n2025, notified the Director at the Massachusetts Emergency Management \nAgency via email that: \nEffective  immediately,  FEMA  will  implement  the  following \nactions: \n \n•  Cancel all BRIC subapplications that were selected but not \nobligated, across all fiscal years. This includes project types \nsuch as safe rooms and shelters, flood reduction, phased \ninfrastructure,  hazard  mitigation  planning,  project \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 4 of 15\nscoping, utility and infrastructure protection, and wildfire \nmanagement. \n \n•  No  further  period  of  performance  extensions  will  be \napproved  for  any  BRIC  projects  without  prior  approval \nfrom the FEMA Administrator.  \n \n  Regional offices will work with grant recipients to \no\nreview partially completed projects and collect key \ninformation,  including  the  period  of  performance \nend  date,  amounts  obligated  and  paid,  and  a \ndescription  of  remaining  work.  No  progression  to \nPhase 2 will be authorized.  \n \n  For fully obligated projects, FEMA will collect similar \no\ndata. Again, no extensions beyond the current period \nof  performance  will  be  granted  without \nAdministrator-level approval.  \n \n•  Obligation  of  all  BRIC-related  management  costs  will \ncease, and FEMA will review the status of management \ncost requirements in conjunction with the above project \nreviews.  Remaining  funds  may  be  de-obligated  unless \nrequired for managing partially or fully obligated projects. \nMost construction projects are anticipated to proceed, but \nphased projects-where only Phase 1 has been awarded-will \nbe  most  impacted.  These  projects  will  be  permitted  to \nprogress to the next Phase 1 milestone and then conclude. \nNo additional funding will be provided for construction or \ncloseout. \n \nId.  Less than two weeks later, FEMA issued an advisory confirming that the \nBRIC program “is concluding” and outlining “next steps.”  April 16 Advisory \n[Dkt # 9-8]. \nConsistent with its public statements, FEMA removed the FY 2024 \nNOFO from its website, see Richardson Decl. ¶ 11, and, in its June 2025 \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 5 of 15\nmonthly  report  to  Congress  (published  on  July  9,  2025),  purported  to \n“revers[e]”  the  set-aside  of  funds  previously  allocated  to  BRIC,  Disaster \nRelief Fund: Monthly Report as of June 30, 2025 (June 2025 Monthly DRF \nReport) [Dkt # 9-19] at 4, 20 (showing a net gain of $4.071 billion to the DRF \nand a net loss of $4.071 billion in available BRIC funding attributable to \n“Reversal of Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Set Aside”); \nsee also Hamilton Test. [Dkt # 66-2] at 4 (testifying under oath to the House \nAppropriations Committee that FEMA had made “available within the DRF \nfunds that were previously set-aside for [BRIC] projects that would not take \nplace for many years”).  FEMA does not, however, appear to have cancelled \nany grants or denied any requests for extensions to date.  Richardson Decl. \n¶ 11.   \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction \nThe  court  begins  with  the  issue  of  subject  matter  jurisdiction,  as \n“[f]ederal  courts  are  obliged  to  resolve  questions  pertaining  to  subject-\nmatter jurisdiction before addressing the merits of a case.”  Acosta-Ramirez \nv.  Banco  Popular  de  Puerto  Rico,  712  F.3d  14,  18  (1st  Cir.  2013).    The \nGovernment raises three challenges to the existence of jurisdiction: ripeness, \nstanding, and sovereign immunity. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 6 of 15\na. Ripeness \n“Questions of ripeness that arise incident to challenged governmental \nactions in the declaratory judgment context are gauged by means of a two-\npart test.”  Ernst & Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 535 \n(1st Cir. 1995).  “First, the court must consider whether the issue presented \nis fit for review.”  Id.  The critical question is “whether the claim involves \nuncertain and contingent events that may not occur as anticipated or may \nnot occur at all.”  Id. at 536, quoting Massachusetts Ass’n of Afro-Am. Police, \nInc. v. Boston Police Dep’t, 973 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam).  \nSecond, the court must “consider the extent to which hardship looms.”  Ernst \n& Young, 45 F.3d at 535.  This inquiry is focused on “whether the challenged \naction creates a ‘direct and immediate’ dilemma for the parties.”  Id., quoting \nW.R. Grace & Co. v. EPA, 959 F.2d 360, 364 (1st Cir. 1992).   \nThe  court  finds  the  first  prong  satisfied  here.    Although  the \nGovernment  equivocates  about  whether  it  has,  in  fact,  ended  the  BRIC \nprogram, the States’ evidence of steps taken by FEMA to implement the \nannounced termination portend the conclusion that a determination has in \nfact been made and that FEMA is inching towards a fait accompli.  The \nagency has cancelled new funding opportunities and informed stakeholders \nthat they should no longer expect to obtain any unobligated funds in existing \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 7 of 15\nprojects.  Even more tellingly, the monthly Congressional report of the DRF \nfor June 30, 2025, which was published by FEMA on July 9, 2025, shows a \nnet gain of $4.071 billion in the DRF account and a corresponding net loss of \n$4.071  billion  in  the  BRIC  account,  each  labeled  “Reversal  of  Building \nResilient Infrastructure and Communities Set Aside.”  June 2025 Monthly \nDRF  Report  at  4,  20.    Against  this  background,  the  carefully  crafted \nassurances of Richardson that “the Secretary of Homeland Security has not \nmade a final decision to end the BRIC program” and that no grants have yet \nbeen cancelled, Richardson Decl. ¶ 11, while perhaps literally true, do not \nconvince  the  court  that  in  reality  the  termination  of  BRIC  is  merely  a \ntheoretical possibility rather than a preordained outcome.  \nThe court also finds the hardship prong satisfied.  Although minor \n“next steps” may remain before the claimed harm will fully coalesce, see \nDefs.’ Opp’n [Dkt # 58] at 8-9, the prospect of harm nonetheless hangs \noverhead like the legendary Sword of Damocles.  It cannot be the case that a \ncourt must defer taking any palliative steps to avert the potential harm until \nthe sword literally drops.  Indeed, Supreme Court precedents in analogous \ncontexts point in the opposite direction.  See, e.g., Babbitt v. United Farm \nWorkers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979) (“When the plaintiff alleges \nan  intention  to  engage  in  a  course  of  conduct  arguably  affected  with  a \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 8 of 15\nconstitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible \nthreat of prosecution thereunder, he ‘should not be required to await and \nundergo  a  criminal  prosecution  as  the  sole  means  of  seeking  relief.’”), \nquoting  Doe  v.  Bolton,  410  U.S.  179,  188  (1973);  see  also  Sindicato \nPuertorriqueno de Trabajadores v. Fortuno, 699 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2012) \n(citing Babbitt for the same premise).   \nb. Standing \nThe standing inquiry has three elements.  “First, the plaintiff must have \nsuffered an ‘injury in fact’–an invasion of a legally protected interest which \nis (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent.”  Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  “Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and \nthe conduct complained of.”  Id.  “Third, it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to \nmerely  ‘speculative,’  that  the  injury  will  be  ‘redressed  by  a  favorable \ndecision.’”  Id. at 561, quoting Simon v. E. Kentucky Welfare Rts. Org., 426 \nU.S. 26, 38, 43 (1976).   \nThe parties dispute only the first element, specifically, whether the \nStates have alleged an injury in fact that is actual or imminent.  For the \nreasons discussed above, the court agrees with the States that the claimed \nharm is likely imminent and not merely speculative.   See McInnis-Misenor \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 9 of 15\nv. Maine Med. Ctr., 319 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2003) (“In general, standing and \nripeness inquiries overlap. The overlap is most apparent in cases that deny \nstanding  because  an  anticipated  injury  is  too  remote,  for  example.”) \n(citations omitted). \nc.  Sovereign Immunity \nThe court need not linger over the issue of sovereign immunity.  The \nGovernment argues that, because the APA, by its plain text, does not apply \nwhere “statutes preclude judicial review,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a), and because 42 \nU.S.C. § 5148 disclaims liability for “any claim based upon the exercise or \nperformance of or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor  duty,”  the  States  cannot  rely  on  the  APA  to  establish  any  waiver  of \nsovereign immunity.1  The problem is this:  The States’ claims are based not \non any discretionary choice of the agency (e.g., which projects to select or \neven whether to implement the program).  They are premised on the agency \nacting  where  it  allegedly  lacked  discretion  –  significantly  reducing  the \n \n1 As it stated during the July 31 hearing, the court agrees with the States \nthat  the  Tucker  Act,  which  confers  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  contract \nactions  against  the  United  States  on  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims,  is \ninapplicable here.  The States do not assert any contract-based claims or seek \nany contractual remedies. The Government appears to acknowledge as much \nelsewhere,  arguing  in  support  of  its  ripeness  challenge  that  it  has  not \nterminated any specific contracts or grants (which might give rise to a Tucker \nAct claim).   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 10 of 15\noperations  of  the  BRIC  program  post-establishment  without  any  prior \nauthorization from Congress.  The claims thus do not fall within the scope of \n§ 5148. \nII.  Preliminary Injunction \nCourts consider the following when determining whether to award a \npreliminary injunction: “(1) the movant’s likelihood of success on the merits, \n(2) the potential for irreparable harm, (3) a balancing of the relevant equities, \nand (4) the effect on the public interest.”  Campbell Soup Co. v. Giles, 47 F.3d \n467, 470 (1st Cir. 1995).  “Likelihood of success is the main bearing wall of \nthe four-factor framework.”  Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., \n102 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996); see also CVS Pharmacy, Inc. v. Lavin, 951 \nF.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2020) (Likelihood of success on the merits is the factor \nthat “weighs most heavily in the preliminary injunction analysis.”); Ryan v. \nU.S. Immig. & Customs Enf’t, 974 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2020) (“If the movant \n‘cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining \nfactors become matters of idle curiosity.’”), quoting New Comm Wireless \nServs. Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002). \na. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe Government challenges likelihood of success on the merits only on \ntwo threshold grounds: (1) the States have not identified any final agency \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 11 of 15\naction giving rise to an APA claim; and (2) the APA precludes judicial review \nbecause the claims are premised on action committed to agency discretion \nby law.2 \nThe court does not find either argument persuasive.  First, while it may \ntechnically be correct to say that the Secretary of DHS has not formally issued \nany declaration of final agency action,3 the agency’s actions in the wake of \nthe announcements nonetheless signal that a final determination has been \nmade from which concrete consequences have been felt.  See Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-178 (1997) (agency action is final if it marks the \nconsummation of the decision making process and determines rights and \nobligations from which legal consequences flow); see also Gen. Elec. Co. v. \nEPA, 290 F.3d 377, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“[A]n agency pronouncement will \nbe considered binding as a practical matter if it . . . is applied by the agency \n \n2 The Government does not dispute that the States have otherwise \nsubstantively established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.  \nThis is wise.  Section 316 of Title 6 of the U.S. Code states that the Secretary \nof DHS “may not substantially or significantly reduce . . . the authorities, \nresponsibilities,  or  functions  of  [FEMA]  or  the  capability  of  [FEMA]  to \nperform those missions, authorities, responsibilities, except as otherwise \nspecifically  provided  in  an  Act  enacted  after October  4,  2006,”  id.,  and \nmitigation is one of the key “authorities, responsibilities, or functions of” \nFEMA, see 6 U.S.C. §§ 313(b)(1), 313(b)(2), 314(a)(9)(A). \n \n3 The court notes, however, that the Hamilton-era pronouncements use \nthe type of language indicative of a final decision – “is” and “will.”  See \nHamilton Memo; April 4 Press Release; April 26 Advisory. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 12 of 15\nin a way that indicates it is binding.”).  As discussed in more depth above, the \nagency  has  taken  affirmative  steps  to  give  effect  to  the  termination \nannouncements, including cancelling the FY 2024 NOFO and redirecting \nmore than $4 billion from the BRIC account to the DRF.   That certain \nadministrative  steps  nonetheless  remain  to  be  performed  before  the \ncontemplated  termination  can  be  fully  consummated  (or  even  that  the \nGovernment remains free to change its mind at any point during the process) \ndoes not diminish the weight of the evidence indicating that FEMA’s ultimate \nintent is to dismantle the BRIC program altogether. \nSecond, the court is not convinced that Congress vested in the agency \nany discretion to reallocate funds from the BRIC account.4  Even assuming \nCongress  appropriated  funds  to  the  agency  in  one  lump-sum  payment \n(without expressing any intent for a specific portion to be set aside for BRIC), \nit is undisputed that the agency subsequently chose to allocate 6% of each \nappropriation between the fiscal years between 2019 and 2025 to the BRIC \nprogram.  June 2025 Monthly DRF Report at 20 (reflecting a 6% set-aside in \nthe BRIC account for each fiscal year between 2019 and 2025); see also \n \n4 The Government does not dispute that any funds appropriated under \nthe IIJA “are only available for that program and cannot be used for other \npurposes” – i.e., that they cannot be returned to the U.S. Treasury and used \nelsewhere.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 5. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 13 of 15\nDisaster Relief Fund: Monthly Report as of April 30, 2025 [Dkt # 9-9] at 19 \n(same).    Section  5133  of  Title  42  of  the  U.S.  Code  appears  to  limit  the \ndiscretion of the executive branch to redirect funds once they are allocated \nto BRIC (and also to regulate the timing of when unobligated funds can be \nwithdrawn from a project), undercutting any notion that Congress permitted \nthe agency to act as it did.  See also Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 503(d)(2), 138 Stat. 460, 615 (2024) (limiting the \nability  of  the  Government  to  reprogram  funds  to  “increase  or  decrease \nfunding  for  grant  programs”);  6  U.S.C.  § 316(d)  (“In  reprogramming  or \ntransferring funds, the Secretary shall comply with any applicable provisions \nof any Act making appropriations for the Department . . . relating to the \nreprogramming or transfer of funds.”). \nb. Remaining Factors \nThe States have shown a realistic existence of irreparable harm.  The \nfunds, if spent on other purposes, will be lost forever.  Cf. Dep’t of Educ. v. \nCalifornia, 145 S. Ct. 966, 969 (2025) (per curiam) (recognizing that money, \nonce spent, can be irrecoverable).  The States have also shown that the \nbalance of hardship and public interest factors tip in their favor.  There is an \ninherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law, and \nthe  potential  hardship  accruing  to  the  States  from  the  funds  being \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 14 of 15\nrepurposed  is  great.    The  BRIC  program  is  designed  to  protect  against \nnatural disasters and save lives.  The potential hardship to the Government, \nin contrast, is minimal.5  The requested relief is appropriately narrow – to \nmerely prevent the Government from spending the funds elsewhere, not to \ncompel the payment of any sum – and even without the BRIC funds, the DRF \nis  operating  at  a  surplus  well  above  the  reserves  the  Government  itself \nestimated to be necessary to “maintain[] the ability to fund initial response \noperations for new significant events.”  See Disaster Relief Fund: Fiscal Year \n2025 Funding Requirements [Dkt # 66-10] at 6; see also Disaster Relief \nFund: Fiscal Year 2024 Funding Requirements [Dkt # 9-18] at 6.  And \nnothing  prevents  the  Government  from  asking  the  court  to  release  any \nnecessary funds on an emergency basis should a disaster of unprecedented \nproportions occur while the injunction remains in place. \n \n5  Given  the  negligible  burden  placed  on  the  Government  by  the \nrequested injunction, it is difficult – if not impossible – for the Government \nto show that the injunction will cause it any irreparable harm.  The injunction \ndoes  no  more  than  ensure  that  the  status  quo  is  maintained  until  the \nunderlying  issues  are  fully  litigated  and  the  court  is  able  to  render  (an \nappealable) judgment on the merits.  Not unexpectedly, in responding to the \ncourt’s questioning during the July 31 hearing, Government counsel was \nunable to articulate any immediate hardship the Government would face \ngiven its assurances that no final decision on the termination of BRIC has \nbeen made.  Any future hardship at most would be one of timing delay should \nthe  Government  in  the  interim  determine  to  proceed  with  the \ndiscontinuation of BRIC. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 79     Filed 08/05/25     Page 15 of 15\nORDER \nFor the forgoing reasons, the motion for a preliminary injunction is \nALLOWED.   The Government is preliminarily enjoined from spending the \nfunds allocated to BRIC for non-BRIC purposes until the court is able to \nrender a final judgment on the merits.  \n \nSO ORDERED. \n/s/ Richard G.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  For nearly thirty years, and across five Presidential administrations, FEMA’s pre-\ndisaster mitigation program has operated on a simple premise: by proactively fortifying our \ncommunities against disasters before they strike, rather than just responding afterward, we will \nreduce injuries, save lives, protect property, and, ultimately, save money that would otherwise be \nspent on post-disaster costs. \n2.  Studies have shown that that each dollar spent on mitigation saves an average of $6 \nin post-disaster costs, with some investments saving even more. Thus, Congress has consistently \nfunded  an  all-purpose  pre-disaster  mitigation  program—now  called  Building  Resilient \nInfrastructure and Communities, or BRIC—for decades, and explicitly directed FEMA to make \nmitigation a core part of its mission. \n3.  Over the past four years, FEMA has selected nearly 2,000 projects to receive \nroughly $4.5 billion in BRIC funding. From Washington to North Carolina and Arizona to Maine, \nand everywhere in between, every state in the nation is relying on this program. \n4.  All  that  changed  when  Cameron  Hamilton,  who  the  Trump  Administration \nunlawfully installed to act as FEMA’s Administrator, suddenly—and illegally—shut down the \nprogram. Mr. Hamilton’s purported termination of the BRIC program was unlawful for three \nreasons. \n5.  First, the BRIC termination is directly contrary to Congress’s statutory direction \nthat Defendants must prioritize mitigation and are specifically barred from substantially reducing \nFEMA’s  mitigation  functions.  By  unilaterally  shutting  down  FEMA’s  flagship  pre-disaster \nmitigation program, Defendants have acted unlawfully and violated core separation of powers \nprinciples. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 3 of 83\n     \n \n6.  Second, the steps Defendants have taken to implement the termination—refusing \nto spend funds Congress directed toward BRIC or trying to spend them on other programs—also \nviolate the Constitution and unlawfully intrude on Congress’s power of the purse. \n7.  Third, neither Mr. Hamilton nor his successor, David Richardson, were lawfully \nappointed to run FEMA, and they therefore lack the authority to shut down the BRIC program. \n8.  The impact of the shutdown has been devastating. Communities across the country \nare being forced to delay, scale back, or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects depending on this \nfunding. Projects that have been in development for years, and in which communities have \ninvested  millions  of  dollars  for  planning,  permitting,  and  environmental  review  are  now \nthreatened. And in the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from \nnatural disasters. \n9.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to compel FEMA to reverse the unlawful termination \nof the BRIC program so that communities across the country can resume this critical work. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n11.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2), 1391(e)(1) because defendants are \nagencies of the United States and officers of the United States acting in their official capacities; a \nsubstantial part of the events and omission giving rise to the claims occurred in this district; and \nplaintiff Commonwealth of Massachusetts resides in this district. \nIII.

FEMA’s Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program Has Helped the Nation Protect Against \nDisasters for Nearly 30 Years \n40.  Following a series of devastating hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes in the 1980s \nand 1990s, Congress and FEMA recognized that fortifying against natural disasters before they \nstrike, rather than just reacting to them, can save lives, protect property, and save the federal \ngovernment “significant sums” that it would otherwise spend on “post-disaster clean-up and \nresponse.” H.R. Rep. No. 104-812, at 78–79 (1996) (Conf. Rep.). \n41.  Congress thus decided that FEMA “should be taking an increasingly active role in \ndeveloping  and  participating  in  pre-disaster  mitigation  programs,”  and  in  1997  started \nappropriating funds for FEMA to develop a program to assist state and local governments in \nprotecting against natural disasters. Id. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 9 of 83\n     \n \n42.  With these appropriations, FEMA started a pilot program called Project Impact in \n1997, which focused mainly on helping communities to evaluate the hazards they faced and \ndevelop mitigation plans. \n43.  After  a  promising  start,  a  bipartisan  group  of  representatives  co-sponsored \nlegislation that would codify the program in statute and expand its focus to helping communities \nacross the country implement these mitigation measures. The Committee Report explained that \n“the only way to control post-disaster spending for response, relief, and recovery is to increase \npre-disaster funding for mitigation, planning, and preparedness,” and cited testimony from FEMA \nsuggesting “that mitigation measures return $3 for every $1 spent.” H.R. Rep. No. 106-40, at 11, \n21 (1999). \n44.  The bill, which ultimately came to be known as the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, \npassed the House of Representatives by a vote of 415 to 2, and passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent. President Clinton signed the bill into law a few months later, and communities large and \nsmall have relied on the program ever since. \n45.  The concept is simple: FEMA provides financial and technical assistance to support \nstate, local, tribal, and territorial governments in implementing “cost-effective” measures that are \n“designed to reduce injuries, loss of life, and damage and destruction of property” from natural \ndisasters. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(b). Recipients may also use these funds to assess hazards they face and \ndevelop plans for mitigating them. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(e). Each grant can cover up to 75% of a \nproject’s  costs,  and  the  federal  share  can  rise  to  90%  for  small  rural  communities.  \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(h).  \n46.   Congress has since required FEMA to award a portion of the funds competitively \nbased on criteria established by Congress, including the extent to which a proposed project will \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 10 of 83\n     \n \nmitigate damage from natural disasters, its cost-effectiveness, the applicant’s commitment to \nspending its own funds on disaster mitigation, and the extent to which the project maximizes “net \nbenefits to society” beyond FEMA savings. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 5133(f), (g). \n47.  To ensure that the benefits would be widespread, Congress provided that any state \nthat “received a major disaster declaration in the previous 7 years” is eligible for grants, required \nFEMA to grant a minimum amount of funding to communities in every eligible state each year, \nand placed an annual cap on the amount any one state can receive. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(2). \n48.  Congress also took measures to ensure that small rural communities would be \nincluded: it specified that one mandatory consideration in awarding the grants is the extent to \nwhich a project benefits a “small impoverished community,” which is “a community of 3,000 or \nfewer  individuals  that  is  economically  disadvantaged.”  42  U.S.C.  §  5133(a).  Only  rural \ncommunities can qualify for this preference—small portions of larger cities cannot. 44 C.F.R. § \n201.2. Congress recognized that small rural communities often do not have sufficient resources to \ncontribute to significant mitigation projects, so it allowed FEMA to cover up to 90% of project \ncosts rather than the 75% limit applicable to other applicants. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 5133(a), (f)(2), \n(g)(9). \n49.  The program has gone by different names over the years—Project Impact, Pre-\nDisaster Mitigation (PDM), and Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC)—but \nregardless of the name, it has been wildly successful. These critical funds have supported hundreds \nof projects in every corner of the country, and, along with other federal mitigation grants, they \nhave also helped to avoid over $150 billion in costs.1 \n \n1 See Nat’l Inst. of Bldg. Scis., Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves: 2019 Report  8 (figure 4), 10 (table 4), 37 \n(table 2-1) (Dec. 2019), https://nibs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NIBS_MMC_MitigationSaves_2019.pdf. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 11 of 83\n     \n \n50.  For instance, before the Trump Administration shut it down, BRIC was poised to \nfund hundreds of critical, lifesaving projects, including: (1) floodwalls, levees, pump stations, and \nstormwater management systems to protect against flooding; (2) seismic retrofits to fortify against \nearthquakes; (3) saferooms to provide shelter from tornados; (4) an evacuation tower to allow for \nescape  from  tsunamis;  (5)  soil  remediation  to  protect  against  landslides;  (6)  vegetation \nmanagement to reduce damage from wildfires; and (7) shoreline upgrades to protect against \nerosion and flooding. Many of these projects were intended to protect critical infrastructure, \nensuring that electricity, heat, clean water, and medical care remain available in emergencies. \n51.  Not only is the program widely relied upon, it has proven to be cost-effective too. \nA 2005 study commissioned by FEMA found that each dollar FEMA spends on mitigation saves \nthe federal government about “$3.65 in avoided post-disaster relief costs and increased federal tax \nrevenue.”2 Another study by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that each dollar spent on \nthe program would avoid roughly three dollars in future losses.3 And a 2019 study found that each \ndollar the federal government invested in mitigation between 1993 and 2016 will avoid roughly \n$6 in costs.4 To put that in absolute terms, two decades of federal investments in mitigation have \nsaved Americans $157.9 billion.5 And some mitigation efforts can save even more. \n52.  Communities in every state have benefited from federally funded mitigation grants, \nwith most states saving at least $1 billion in post-disaster costs, and four states—Louisiana, New \nJersey, New York, and Texas—each avoiding at least $10 billion in post-disaster costs.6  \n \n2 Nat’l Inst.

While cost savings are one major benefit of the program, these dollars represent \nmore than money. They represent lives saved, homes spared, businesses surviving, and public \nservices—like hospitals, schools, and fire departments—remaining open when people need them \nmost.  \nB.  Congress Expanded the Program During President Trump’s First Term and FEMA \nRebranded it as BRIC \n54.  Given the success of the program, Congress has continued to invest in it. In 2018, \nin the wake of Hurricane Harvey causing more than $100 billion of damage to Texas, Hurricane \nMaria killing thousands in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Irma devastating Florida, and wildfires ravaging \nCalifornia, Congress held hearings to assess what more it could do.  \n55.  President Trump’s first FEMA Administrator, Brock Long, explained in written \ntestimony that “Building more resilient communities is the best way to reduce risks to people, \nproperty, and taxpayer dollars. I cannot overstate the importance of focusing on investing in \nmitigation before a disaster strikes.”7 And he emphasized the point in oral testimony, too: \n“We have to do more pre-disaster mitigation. Pre-disaster mitigation is the key to becoming more \nresilient and reducing disaster impacts.”8 \n56.  A  few  months  later,  FEMA  released  its  2018–2022  Strategic  Plan.  FEMA’s \n“Strategic  Goal  1”  was  “Build  a  Culture  of  Preparedness,”  and  its  first  objective  was  to \n“Incentivize  Investments  that  Reduce  Risk,  Including  Pre-Disaster  Mitigation,  and  Reduce \nDisaster Costs at All Levels.” FEMA explained: \nBuying down the risk prior to a disaster pays off – either by lowering the cost of \nthe disaster or eliminating the need for a presidentially-declared disaster altogether \nbecause  of  the  lessened  impact.  FEMA  plays a  critical  role  in  enabling  and \nincentivizing investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation. \n \n7 2017 Hurricane Season: Oversight of the Federal Response: Hearing Before the S. Comm. On Homeland \nSec. & Gov’t Affairs, 115th Cong. 58 (2017) (statement of William “Brock” Long, Administrator, FEMA). \n8 Id. at 9. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 13 of 83\n     \n \nAnd FEMA pledged to “work with Congress to develop flexible and holistic approaches for more \nFederal funds to be spent on risk reduction and pre-disaster mitigation.”9 \n57.  When Administrator Long returned to Congress a few months later, he reiterated \nthat “developing resilient communities ahead of an incident reduces loss of life and economic \ndisruption,” and stated bluntly: “It is a no-brainer: More investment in pre-disaster mitigation \nrather than doing it after the fact is ultimately going to reduce disaster costs.”10 \n58.  Following these hearings, Senators Ron Johnson (R-WI), Claire McCaskill (D-\nMO), and John Kennedy (R-LA) co-sponsored the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 \n(DRRA) to increase the consistency of funding for the pre-disaster mitigation program. For most \nof its history, the program was funded exclusively through ordinary appropriations, which could \nbe unpredictable and made planning for and executing long-term infrastructure projects difficult. \nThis bill would allow FEMA to also set aside certain funds from the Disaster Relief Fund, which \nfunds FEMA’s post-disaster grants, into a dedicated National Public Infrastructure Predisaster \nMitigation Fund. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(i)(1). By setting aside a fraction of these post-disaster funds \nfor pre-disaster mitigation, FEMA could establish “a greater balance . . . between pre- and post-\ndisaster resilience investments,” which would “save lives and Federal tax dollars.” S. Rep. No. \n115-446, at 3 (2018). \n59.  At the same time, Congress indicated that it would appropriate more funds for the \nDisaster Relief Fund so that there would be no reduction in the amount available for post-disaster \ngrants. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(i)(3). \n \n9  Fed.  Em.  Mgmt.

Comm. On Homeland Sec. & Gov’t \nAffairs, 115th Cong., 5, 43 (2018) (testimony of William “Brock” Long, Administrator, FEMA). \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 14 of 83\n     \n \n60.  The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 398–23 and passed the \nSenate by a vote of 93–6. President Trump signed it into law a few days later. \n61.  FEMA announced that this new “reliable stream of sufficient funding” would allow \ncommunities “to plan and execute mitigation programs to reduce disaster risk nationwide.”11 And \nin a subsequent report FEMA reiterated that Congress’s expansion of the pre-disaster mitigation \nprogram under the DRRA “supports FEMA’s efforts to incentivize pre-disaster mitigation by \nproviding a more reliable stream of funding that enables communities to better plan and execute \nmitigation programs that reduce their disaster risk.”12 \n62.  After the bill passed, FEMA rebranded what was then called the “Pre-Disaster \nMitigation (PDM)” program as the “Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC)” \nprogram. FEMA publicized the change well before it went into effect and ensured that existing \nprojects under the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program would be unaffected. Congress also authorized \nFEMA to transfer funds previously appropriated for the program, when it was still called the Pre-\nDisaster Mitigation program, into the new National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation \nFund.13 \n63.  FEMA subsequently set aside funds for BRIC for fiscal years 2019 through 2025.14  \n64.  In addition to appropriating funds for FEMA to set aside for BRIC, Congress also \nappropriated another $1 billion directly to the program as part of the bipartisan Infrastructure \n \n11 Press Release, Fed.

See Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58, \n135 Stat. 429, 1387 (2021). In doing so, Congress required FEMA to make at least $200 million \navailable for grants for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026, in addition to the \namounts FEMA set aside for the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund. See \nid.  (providing  that  “in  addition  to  amounts  set  aside  pursuant  to . . . 42  U.S.C.  § \n5133 . . . $200,000,000 . . . shall be made available” for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, \n2025, and 2026) (emphasis added). \n65.  And since then, Congress has continued to appropriate additional funds for specific \nBRIC projects through Congressionally directed spending.15 \nC.  The Modern BRIC Program \n66.  Following Congress’s passage of the DRRA, the BRIC program works as follows. \n67.  FEMA estimates the total cost of certain post-disaster grants and then uses that \nnumber to determine how much money it can set aside for BRIC and move into the National Public \nInfrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(i)(1). To ensure that the BRIC \nset aside does “not reduce the amounts otherwise made available for” the post-disaster grants, \nFEMA incorporates additional funds for BRIC into its budget requests to Congress. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 5133(i)(3).16 \n \n15 See, e.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47 cl. 12(B), 138 Stat. 460, 608 \n(2024) (appropriating approximately $191 million “for pre-disaster mitigation grants under . . . 42 U.S.C. § 5133(e)”). \n16 See also William L. Painter, Cong. Rsch. Serv. R45484, The Disaster Relief Fund: Overview and Issues \n31(2024),  https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45484  (“In  FY2020,  FEMA  began to  request funding for  a \nstatutorily established set-aside for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program . . . .

After FEMA receives funding from Congress, it sets aside the funds for the BRIC \nprogram and moves them into the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund. See \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(i)(1). Once the funds are set aside, they must remain in the National Public \nInfrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund. 42 U.S.C. 5133(f)(3) (providing that any funds lawfully \nwithdrawn  from  selected  projects  must  be  used  for  BRIC  grants  the  next  year);  Further \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 503(d)(2), 138 Stat. 460, 615 (2024) \n(providing that Defendants cannot reprogram or transfer funds “to increase or decrease funding \nfor grant programs”). \n69.  FEMA then issues a notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) setting out the amount \nof funding available for that year, the criteria the agency will apply in selecting projects, and the \napplication instructions.17 One mandatory criterion is that every project selected must be “cost-\neffective,” meaning that it will save more money than it costs. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(e)(1)(A).  \n70.  Applying for a BRIC grant is a significant undertaking. In addition to demonstrating \ncost-effectiveness, States and their subapplicants often must undertake months or years of costly \nplanning and design, feasibility studies and modeling, environmental review, and stakeholder \nengagement to prepare their applications. FEMA then reviews the applications and selects the most \npromising projects while ensuring that each state that applies is allocated a minimum amount of \nfunding required by the law, and that no one state receives too much funding. See 42 U.S.C. § \n5133(f)(2). Once projects are selected, applicants often go through additional rounds of planning, \npermitting, environmental review, and stakeholder engagement before a final grant agreement is \nsigned and all the funds are fully obligated.  \n \n17 See, e.g., Dep’t of Homeland Security, Notice of Funding Opportunity for Fiscal Year 2023: Building \nResilient Infrastructure and Communities Program (Oct. 12, 2022), https://www.floridadisaster.org/globalassets/fy-\n2023-bric-notice-of-funding-opportunity-nofo.pdf. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 17 of 83\n     \n \n71.  To ensure that the federal BRIC funds are available for states at the end of this \nlengthy process, Congress has provided that once projects are selected—i.e., once BRIC funds are \nallocated to states—Defendants cannot withdraw them unless the funds “remain unobligated by \nthe end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal year for which the amounts were allocated.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(A). And even if the funds are withdrawn at that time, they must be returned \nto the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and made “available to be \nawarded on a competitive basis” during the next fiscal year. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(B). \n72.  Once a project receives final approval, the funds are formally obligated, and \nconstruction may begin. \n73.  In addition to funding, the BRIC program also offers non-financial Direct Technical \nAssistance (DTA), which provides “full support to communities that may not have the resources \nto begin . . . resilience planning and project solution design on their own.”18 DTA is not a grant. \nFEMA assigns experts to work directly with communities for up to 36 months to build local \ncapacity and ultimately help them apply for BRIC funding.19 This in-kind support includes \nassistance in developing BRIC project applications, like demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of a \nBRIC subapplication, as well as project development, scoping, and submission. As of December \n2024, FEMA had awarded BRIC DTA to 167 communities, including 93 communities selected in \n2024 for FY 2023 DTA.20 \n \n18 FEMA Fiscal Year 2024 Program Support Material, Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities \nDirect Technical Assistance (Jan. 2025), https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_hma_bric-dta-\nprogram-support-material_fy2024.pdf. \n19 FEMA, Fiscal Year 2022 Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Direct Technical Assistance \nSelections, at 9, https://ecivis-\npartners.s3.amazonaws.com/bplih/grantfile/bd/bd8fbebab8d56c54512a6b89551c3e5eb6a88a51. \n20 FEMA, BRIC Direct Technical Assistance Communities: Fiscal Year 2023 Selected Communities,  \nhttps://ecivis-partners.s3.amazonaws.com/bplih/grantfile/bd/bd8fbebab8d56c54512a6b89551c3e5eb6a88a51. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 18 of 83\n     \n \nD.  Every State Is Relying on the BRIC Program. \n74.  The BRIC program is critically important nationwide. Over the past four years, \nFEMA has selected nearly 2,000 projects from every corner of the country to receive roughly $4.5 \nbillion in funding.  \n75.  Due to the unique threats they face, coastal communities have received the largest \nallocations over the past four years, with California, Louisiana, Texas, New York, New Jersey, \nFlorida, North Carolina, and Washington leading the way.  \n76.  But interior communities rely on BRIC too: Pennsylvania and Utah have received \nthe next largest allocations, and Ohio is not far behind. And before the administration unlawfully \nterminated BRIC, FEMA was poised to fund upgrades to electrical infrastructure in Iowa (~$11 \nmillion), Nebraska (~$25 million), and Kentucky (~$6.4 million) so that residents can maintain \npower and heat during storms; flood mitigation in Ohio (~$24 million), Montana (~$7 million), \nIdaho (~$7 million), West Virginia (~$7 million), and Indiana (~$6.2 million), to reduce injuries \nand property damage; pump stations in Pennsylvania (~$100 million) to protect infrastructure \nduring severe storms; and a pump station in North Dakota (~$7.1 million) to provide a small \ncommunity with a reliable water source, even during low river flows.  \n77.  In fact, BRIC has been so popular that it has been oversubscribed each application \ncycle, even as FEMA has increased the amount of funding available. Over the last four years there \nwere hundreds more applications than could be selected, seeking billions more dollars than was \navailable: \n \n \n \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 19 of 83\n     \n \nFiscal Year  Funds Available21  Funds Applied For22 \n2020  $500 Million  $3.1 Billion \n2021  $1 Billion  $3.5 Billion \n2022  $2.295 Billion  $3.6 Billion \n2023  $1 Billion  $5.4 Billion \n2024  $750 Million  BRIC Cancelled \n \nFiscal Year  Projects Selected23  Applications24 \n2020  408  987 \n2021  371  789 \n2022  518  801 \n2023  720  1,235 \n \n21 This figure is based on the Notice of Funding Opportunity for each fiscal year. \n22 This figure is the sum of the “federalShareAmount” column for all applications, as determined by the \nmethodology in footnote 20. \n23 This figure is based on OpenFEMA data last updated on June 24, 2025 and downloaded from FEMA.gov \non July 10, 2025.

The Second Trump Administration Suddenly Shuts Down the BRIC Program \n78.  Although the first Trump Administration expanded the BRIC program, the second \nTrump Administration has expressed hostility toward FEMA from the start. \n79.  Before  President  Trump  entered  office  for  the  second  time,  former  officials \nassociated with President Trump developed a series of policy proposals in a Heritage Foundation \nreport called “Project 2025.” The section on FEMA asserts, without evidence, and contrary to \nFEMA’s position during the first Trump administration, that FEMA grants “do not provide \nmeasurable  gains  for  preparedness  or  resiliency,”  and  argues  that  these  grants  “should  be \nterminated.”25 It cautions, however, that doing so “will require action by Members of Congress \nwho repeatedly vote to fund grants.”26 \n80.  On January 24, 2025, just four days after being sworn into office, President Trump \ntold reporters, “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away.”27  \n81.  That same day, he issued an Executive Order creating a Council to Assess the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, which is supposed to perform “a full-scale review” of \nFEMA and “recommend to the President improvements or structural changes” to the agency. Exec. \nOrder No. 14180, 90 Fed. Reg. 8743 (Jan. 24, 2025). \n82.  Then, in a televised cabinet meeting on March 24, 2025, Department of Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Kristi Noem said, “we’re going to eliminate FEMA.”28  \n \n25 See Ken Cuccinelli, Department of Homeland Security at 154, in Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership: \nThe  Conservative  Promise  (The  Heritage  Foundation,  2023),  https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2024/05/Project-2025-Mandate-for-Leadership-The-Conservative-Promise.pdf. \n26 Id. \n27 Zack Colman, Trump’s talking about shutting down FEMA.

The next day, Secretary Noem, Corey Lewandowksi, and Cameron Hamilton, who \nwas leading FEMA at the time, met and “debated the possibility of rescinding President Donald \nTrump’s recent executive order establishing a FEMA Review Council and instead moving more \nquickly to dismantle the agency.”29  \n84.  But eliminating FEMA is illegal. In addition to fundamental separation of powers \nprinciples  barring  Defendants  from  unilaterally  shuttering  congressionally  created  agencies, \nCongress took a belt-and-suspenders approach with FEMA and passed a statute in 2006 entitled \n“Preserving  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,”  which  requires  FEMA  to  “be \nmaintained as a distinct entity” within DHS. 6 U.S.C. § 316(a). \n85.  As an alternative to eliminating FEMA, Defendants also discussed “narrowing and \nfocusing  the  aperture  of  FEMA’s  mission  dramatically”  by  “narrowing  the  agency’s \nresponsibilities to helping survivors in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”30 As part of that \neffort, Secretary Noem said “that she wants to eliminate FEMA’s role in funding long-term \nrebuilding efforts and halt multibillion-dollar grants programs that help communities prepare for \ndisasters.”31 When reached for comment, a DHS spokesperson essentially confirmed the reporting: \n“We are grateful the press is covering Secretary Noem’s efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and \nabuse within the Department of Homeland Security.”32 \n86.  But narrowing FEMA’s mission and functions to only post-disaster response is \nillegal too: the same statute that bars Defendants from eliminating FEMA also prohibits them from \n“substantially or significantly reduc[ing] . . . the authorities, responsibilities, or functions of the \n \n29 Gabe Cohen, ‘We’re not preparing’: As Trump officials vow to eliminate FEMA, the agency is already in \nturmoil,  CNN,  March  26,  2025,  https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/politics/fema-payments-staffing-stalled-\nturmoil/index.html. \n30  Thomas  Frank,  FEMA  on  the  chopping  block,  E&E  News  by  Politico,  March  26,  2025, \nhttps://www.eenews.net/articles/fema-on-the-chopping-block/. \n31 Id. \n32 Id. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 22 of 83\n     \n \nAgency or the capability of the Agency to perform those missions, authorities, responsibilities, \nexcept as otherwise specifically provided in an Act enacted after October 4, 2006.” 6 U.S.C. § \n316(c)(1).  \n87.  This  provision  was  added  in  the  wake  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  after  Congress \ndetermined that one of the key reasons FEMA was unprepared was that DHS leadership had \nrejected the concept of “integrated emergency management,” which posits that the most effective \nway to reduce damage from disasters is for a single agency to engage in four interrelated functions: \nmitigation,  preparation,  response,  and  recovery.33  Instead  of  following  this  approach,  DHS \nleadership had stripped FEMA of its preparedness responsibilities and assigned them to others \nwithin DHS.34 Congress concluded that this “was a mistake” and that “preparedness, response, \nrecovery, and mitigation require synergy” so FEMA must engage in all four functions.35 \n88.  As a result, Congress provided by law that each of these four functions, including \nmitigation, is a core component of FEMA’s mission: “The primary mission of” FEMA “is to \nreduce the loss of life and property and protect the Nation from all hazards” through “a risk-based, \ncomprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, \nand mitigation.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(1) (emphasis added); see also 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(2)(D) \n(providing that the Administrator “shall . . . integrate the Agency’s emergency preparedness, \nprotection,  response,  recovery,  and  mitigation  responsibilities”);  6  U.S.C.  §  314(a)(9)(A) \n(providing that the FEMA “Administrator shall provide federal leadership necessary to . . . mitigate \nagainst a natural disaster,” including by maintaining “a risk-based, comprehensive emergency \n \n33 S.

And Congress also provided that Defendants may not alter that mission, nor can \nthey materially reduce FEMA’s ability to carry out any of these functions, unless “otherwise \nspecifically provided” by Congress “in an Act enacted after October 4, 2006.” 6 U.S.C. § \n316(c)(1). \n90.  Congress  has  not  enacted  any  statute  “after  October  4,  2006”  “specifically” \nauthorizing Defendants to terminate FEMA’s pre-disaster mitigation grant program or reduce \nFEMA’s mitigation functions and capabilities. \n91.  Nevertheless,  a  few  days  after  the  March  25  Noem–Lewandowski–Hamilton \nmeeting, Mr. Hamilton, then the so-called “Senior Official Performing the Duties of FEMA \nAdministrator,” sent a memo (“the Hamilton Memo”) directing the termination of the BRIC \nprogram and setting out rules for the agency to apply in carrying out the termination.36 The memo \nasserted, without evidence, that “Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grants \nhave not increased the level of hazard mitigation as much as desired, and may supplant state, local, \ntribal and territorial capital investment planning.”37 \n92.  The memo includes a series of directives agency staff were required to follow to \ncarry out the termination, including: \na)  “Not award the BRIC projects selected but not yet awarded across all fiscal \nyears.”  \n \n36  Memorandum  from  Cameron  Hamilton  to  Christopher  Logan,  Future  of  the  Building  Resilient \nInfrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program (April 2, 2025), available at https://www.oregon.gov/oem/Memos \n%20and%20Executive%20Orders/250404_SOPDO_Administrator_Memo_on_BRIC.pdf. \n37 Id. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 24 of 83\n     \n \nb)  “Not grant any additional period of performance extensions on any BRIC \nprojects, without [Hamilton’s] prior approval.”  \nc)  “Halt  the  obligation  of  all  management  costs  and  review  the  status  of \nmanagement cost requirements in line with the project review specified above, \nwith remaining funds deobligated except those required to manage partially or \nfully obligated projects.” \nd)  “[C]ancel the FY24 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the BRIC grant \nprogram.”38 \n93.  Two days later, FEMA issued a press release entitled “FEMA Ends Wasteful, \nPoliticized Grant Program, Returning Agency to Core Mission of Helping Americans Recovering \nfrom Natural Disasters,” in which it announced that “FEMA is ending the Building Resilient \nInfrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program” and “canceling all BRIC applications from \nFiscal Years 2020-2023.”39  \n94.  Defendants acknowledged that Congress had appropriated $1 billion toward the \nBRIC program through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act but announced that \nFEMA would not spend those funds as Congress had instructed. Id. Instead, Defendants stated that \nthey would be withholding the funds and returning roughly $882 million dollars to the U.S. \nTreasury. Id. The press release also said that Defendants would move BRIC funds out of the \nNational Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and back into the Disaster Relief Fund. \nId.  \n \n38 Id. \n39 Press Release, Fed.

About two weeks after that, FEMA issued an “Update on FEMA Ending the \nBuilding Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program” affirming the April 4 announcement \nthat FEMA was “ending” the BRIC program and providing more detail about FEMA’s “next steps” \nin implementing the Hamilton Memo.40 Specifically, FEMA announced: \na)  “As the program is concluding, the Fiscal Year 2024 BRIC funding opportunity \nis cancelled, no applications submitted will be reviewed and no funds will be \nawarded.” \nb)  “Fully obligated projects that have not started construction will not be approved \nand will end.” \nc)  “FEMA will not be extending project deadlines without the Senior Official \nPerforming the Duties of the FEMA Administrator’s approval.” \nd)  “For previous funding cycles, FEMA will cancel all of the BRIC projects \nselected but not obligated across fiscal years 2020-2023.” \ne)  “Management costs will only continue for partially or fully obligated projects.” \n96.  Since then FEMA has confirmed to Plaintiffs that the BRIC program is ending and \nhas taken measures to carry out the termination. For instance, on April 7, 2025, FEMA Region 1 \nDeputy Regional Administrator Jarrett W. Devine sent an email to directors of  emergency \nmanagement agencies within Region 1, including the Director of the Massachusetts Emergency \nManagement Agency. The email states that “FEMA has announced the cancellation of the \nBuilding Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program” and that “the Senior Official \nPerforming the Duties of the FEMA Administrator directed the agency to cancel the Fiscal Year \n \n40 FEMA Advisory, Update on FEMA Ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program \n(Apr.  16,  2025),  available  at  https://www.floods.org/wp-content/uploads/FEMA-Advisory-Update-on-FEMA-\nEnding-the-Building-Resilient-Infrastructure-and-Communities-Program-April-16-2025.pdf. \n \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 26 of 83\n     \n \n2024 BRIC funding opportunity and to end BRIC Direct Technical Assistance to communities and \ntribes.”  \n97.  In the same email, Deputy Regional Administrator Devine stated that “effective \nimmediately FEMA will implement the following actions:” \na)  “Cancel all BRIC subapplications that were selected but not obligated, across \nall fiscal years. This includes project types such as safe rooms and shelters, \nflood  reduction,  phased  infrastructure,  hazard  mitigation  planning,  project \nscoping, utility and infrastructure protection, and wildfire management.” \nb)  “No further period of performance extensions will be approved for any BRIC \nprojects without prior approval from the FEMA Administrator.” \nc)  “Regional offices will work with grant recipients to review partially completed \nprojects and collect key information, including the period of performance end \ndate, amounts obligated and paid, and a description of remaining work. No \nprogression to Phase 2 will be authorized.” \nd)  “For  fully  obligated  projects,  FEMA  will  collect  similar  data.  Again,  no \nextensions beyond the current period of performance will be granted without \nAdministrator-level approval.” \ne)  “Obligation of all BRIC-related management costs will cease, and FEMA will \nreview the status of management cost requirements in conjunction with the \nabove project reviews. Remaining funds may be de-obligated unless required \nfor managing partially or fully obligated projects.” \n98.  Deputy  Regional  Administrator  Devine  also  offered  support  “throughout  the \nwinddown process.” \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 27 of 83\n     \n \n99.  As another example, FEMA Region 3 Senior Advisor for Risk Reduction Dustin \nR. Brosius emailed directors of emergency management agencies within Region 3, including the \nHazard Mitigation Officer for the DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency \n(“HSEMA”). Among other things, the email states: “In light of the cancellation of the FY 2024 \nBRIC program and its termination moving forward, Sarah Cobelli, the Community Resilience and \nInfrastructure Grants Branch Chief, will be reaching out to discuss the impacts on your specific \nawards.” A few days later, FEMA Region 3 Community Resilience and Infrastructure Grants \nBranch Chief Sarah Cobelli met with representatives from HSEMA. On April 15, Ms. Cobelli sent \na follow-up email to HSEMA in which she stated, “As discussed on our call Friday, attached you \nwill find a project list and total federal funding amount of BRIC projects selected between FY20-\nFY23 that have not been awarded and that will not be awarded in alignment with the April 2, 2025 \nmemo from the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the FEMA Administrator, Cameron \nHamilton.” \n100.  Other Plaintiff states have received similar communications from FEMA. \n101.  Defendants have since begun implementing the termination. \n102.  On May 7, 2025, Hamilton testified to the House Appropriations Committee that \nFEMA “increased resources for disaster recovery and response” by “making available with the \nDRF funds that were previously set-aside for [BRIC] projects.”43  \n103.  FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund Monthly Reports show that in April, FEMA initiated \na “Reversal of Building Infrastructure and Communities Set Aside” and unlawfully diverted \n$4.071 billion out of the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund portion of the \nDisaster Relief Fund and into the Major Declarations component of the Disaster Relief Fund, \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 28 of 83\n     \n \nwhich funds FEMA’s post-disaster grants.41 This is the entire balance of the BRIC set aside and \nmore than 80% of the funds for BRIC. \n104.  The Monthly Report showed a net gain of $4.071 billion to the DRF and a new \ncorresponding net loss of $4.01 billion in available BRIC funding, both attributable to “Reversal \nof Building Infrastructure and Communities Set Aside.”42 \n105.  Before the Court’s injunction, FEMA projected that it would start spending the \nBRIC funds on these other post-disaster programs in August 2025.43 \n106.  Defendants have also largely stopped operating the program by failing to review or \napprove BRIC projects that have been selected but are not yet obligated (including those that \nFEMA staff had originally informed Plaintiff States were on track to be obligated by this summer), \nfailing to issue or review requests for information from recipients or subrecipients, ending BRIC \nDTA support provided to local communities, and, at least in some cases, ceasing all routine activity \nand communication with recipients and subrecipients. For these Plaintiffs, FEMA staff’s typical \naction and responsiveness switched abruptly to silence and inaction following the cancellation \nannouncement. FEMA BRIC staff were operating normally, then Defendants publicly cancelled \nthe program and they stopped doing so. \n107.  In fact, according to Defendants’ own data, Defendants have not made a single \nBRIC award between April 2, 2025, when the Hamilton Memo was sent, and August 25, 2025. \n \n41  See  Fed.  Em.  Mgmt.

Defendants have cancelled the FY 2024 NOFO, removed the NOFO notice from \nthe FEMA website, and awarded no funds. \n109.  Defendants  have  begun  implementing  a  process  to  channel  all  period  of \nperformance extensions through the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator. \n110.  Defendants have begun removing references to the BRIC program from agency \nguidance, including FEMA’s Tribal Declarations Interim Guidance.45 \n111.  Defendants have consistently maintained they are ending the BRIC program and \nhave done nothing to disabuse the public—or Congress—of this fact, despite extensive media \ncoverage of the BRIC termination and outreach and public statements from members of Congress \nobjecting to it. For instance, over 80 members of Congress sent Defendants a bipartisan letter \nurging Defendants to reinstate BRIC.46 Senator Bill Cassidy gave an impassioned speech on the \nSenate floor decrying BRIC’s termination: “Congress passed it for a reason. Congress authorized \nAND appropriated this money. Congress said this program WILL exist . . . . To do anything other \nthan use that money to fund . . . mitigation projects is to thwart the will of Congress.”47 And the \n \n44 These figures are based on OpenFEMA data last updated on August 25, 2025 and downloaded from \nFEMA.gov on August 26, 2025.

And yet, before this litigation, Defendants had not issued corrective statements, \nreopened the 2024 NOFO, moved the BRIC funds back into the National Public Infrastructure \nPredisaster Mitigation Fund, or resumed operating the program. \n113.  In fact, on June 16, a FEMA spokesperson told CBS: “the BRIC program was \n‘wasteful and ineffective’” and “we are ending non-mission critical programs.”51 \nF.  Cameron Hamilton Was Not Lawfully Acting as the FEMA Administrator When He \nTerminated BRIC \n114.  At the time Mr. Hamilton purported to shut down the BRIC program, he was not \nlawfully acting as the FEMA Administrator. \n115.  The  Constitution’s  Appointments  Clause  provides  the  “exclusive  means”  of \nappointing Officers of the United States. Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 244 (2018). That Clause \nprovides that principal “Officers of the United States” may be appointed only if they are nominated \nby the President “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.” U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2. \nThis “is also the default manner of appointment for inferior officers,” which applies unless \nCongress authorizes the President, “Courts of Law,” or the head of a department to appoint the \ninferior officer. Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 660 (1997); U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2. \n116.  The  FEMA  Administrator  is  an  Officer  of  the  United  States  because  the \nAdministrator’s duties on behalf of the United States are ongoing, and not occasional or temporary, \nand the FEMA Administrator exercises significant authority on behalf of the United States.

In addition, Congress has set minimum qualifications for who may serve as FEMA \nAdministrator. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs made recommendations for how FEMA could be reformed so that it \nwould perform better when the next disaster struck. One of the Committee’s key findings was that \nFEMA did not perform as Congress expected during Katrina in part because of “unqualified senior \npolitical leadership.”49 Among other problems, “FEMA’s senior political appointees, including \nDirector Michael Brown and Deputy Director Patrick Rhode, had little or no prior relevant \nemergency-management experience before joining FEMA.”50  \n118.  As a result, Congress changed the law to require FEMA’s Administrator to have “a \ndemonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management and homeland security” and \n“not less than 5 years of executive leadership and management experience in the public or private \nsector.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(c)(2). \n119.  Mr. Hamilton was never nominated to serve as FEMA Administrator, nor was he \nconfirmed by the Senate. Moreover, he “lacks the emergency management experience required \nunder federal law.”51 See 6 U.S.C. § 313(c)(2). \n120.  Nonetheless, the administration tried to work around the required process: On \nJanuary 20, 2025, Deanne Criswell, the FEMA Administrator under President Biden, resigned. \nRather than nominating Mr. Hamilton as FEMA Administrator and seeking Senate confirmation, \nthe administration appointed him to serve as the Associate Administrator of FEMA’s Office of \n \n49 S. Rep. No. 109-322, at 225 (2006); see also id. at 214–15. \n50 Id. at 593. \n51  Thomas  Frank,  Fired  FEMA  chief  threatened  to  quit  weeks  ago,  Politico,  May  8,  2025, \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-00335840. \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 32 of 83\n     \n \nResponse and Recovery on January 20, 2025, and then, within two days, elevated him to act as the \nAdministrator under the title “Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator.”52 \n121.  That approach is not authorized by Congress or the Constitution. Through the \nFederal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), Congress has provided the “exclusive means for \ntemporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of any office of an \nExecutive Agency . . . for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.” 5 U.S.C. § 3347(a) (emphasis added). \n122.  Congress provided that when a Presidentially-nominated and Senate-confirmed \nofficer resigns, the “first assistant to the office” automatically becomes the acting officer unless \nthe President directs either another Presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed person to \ntemporarily fill the role or appoints a senior officer or employee of the agency who was in that \nposition for at least “90 days” in “the 365-day period preceding the date of” the resignation. 5 \nU.S.C. § 3345(a). \n123.  Mr. Hamilton did not satisfy any of these criteria: he was not the first assistant to \nthe FEMA Administrator on January 20, 2025, he had not been nominated by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate to any office, and he was not a senior officer or employee at FEMA or \nDHS for at least 90 days in the year preceding the vacancy. Instead, during the year prior to the \nvacancy,  Mr.  Hamilton  was  the  Director  of  Business  Strategy  at  a  consulting  firm  called \nProSoDel LLC and a candidate for Congress. Mr. Hamilton thus could not lawfully act as the \nFEMA Administrator, and his termination of the BRIC program was unlawful. \n \n52 Christopher Flavelle, Former Navy SEAL Said to Be Interim Head of FEMA, The New York Times, Jan. \n22, 2025, https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/fema-announcement-cameron-hamilton.html. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 33 of 83\n     \n \nG.  The Trump Administration Replaced Hamilton with Another Illegal Administrator \n124.  On May 7, 2025, Mr. Hamilton testified before Congress that “I do not believe that \nit is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency.”53 He was fired the next day.  \n125.  FEMA then announced that David Richardson, who was appointed in January 2025 \nto serve as DHS’s Assistant Secretary for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, \nwould act as Administrator. Mr. Richardson has never been confirmed by the Senate to any \nposition, nor does he meet the criteria set out by the FVRA: he was not the first assistant to the \nFEMA Administrator on January 20, 2025, he had not been nominated by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate to any office at that time, and he was not a senior officer or employee at \nFEMA or DHS for at least 90 days in the 365 days preceding the vacancy. \n126.  Like Hamilton, Richardson “has no prior emergency management experience,” so \nhe also does not meet the statutory qualifications for the FEMA Administrator. \n127.  In his first meeting with FEMA staff, Mr. Richardson declared: “I can’t recall the \nfull title, but essentially, I’m acting. I don’t need the full title. All I need is the authority from the \npresident to put me in here as some degree of acting and I will make sure his intent gets \ncompleted.”54  \n128.  Richardson is incorrect. The President’s say-so does not override the Constitution. \nTo lawfully act as FEMA Administrator, Richardson must either be confirmed by the Senate or \nsatisfy the requirements of the FVRA. Because Mr. Richardson has not been nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate and does not satisfy the requirements of the FVRA, he is \n \n53 Lauren Sommer and Rebecca Hersher, FEMA leader is out, amid questions over future of the agency, \nNPR, May 9, 2025, https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5391920/fema-head-replaced-disaster-season. \n54 Nicole Sganga, New FEMA head tells staff: “Don’t get in my way . . .

To date, after nearly six months in office, President Trump has failed to nominate \na FEMA Administrator for Senate confirmation. \nH.  The Steps Defendants Have Taken to Implement the Hamilton Memo—Including \nRefusing to Spend Congressionally Appropriated Funds on BRIC and Preparing to \nSpend Those Funds on Other Programs—Are Independently Unlawful \n1.  Refusing to spend funds Congress appropriated for BRIC is unlawful. \n130.  Our Constitution “exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \nPresident.” City & County. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018). That \nmeans when Congress appropriates funds for Defendants to make available, Defendants must do \nso. \n131.  “[T]he President is without authority to thwart congressional will by canceling \nappropriations passed by Congress.” Id. And “the President and federal agencies may not ignore \nstatutory mandates or prohibitions merely because of policy disagreement with Congress.” In re \nAiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n132.  Defendants’ refusal to make available the funds Congress appropriated for BRIC \ngrants in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and their plan to instead return those funds to \nthe Treasury is unlawful.  \n133.  To the extent FEMA is withholding any other Congressionally appropriated funds, \nsuch as funds directed to particular BRIC projects through Congressionally directed spending or \nfunds left over from when the program was called Pre-Disaster Mitigation, that, too, is unlawful. \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 35 of 83\n     \n \n2.  Moving the BRIC funds out of the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster \nMitigation Fund to spend on other programs is unlawful. \n134.  When Congress authorized FEMA to set aside funds from the Disaster Relief Fund \nfor the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund, it intended for those funds to \nbe used for BRIC grants, not for other programs. So Congress took measures to ensure that funds \nthat are set aside for BRIC are used for BRIC.  \n135.  First, Congress provided that once BRIC projects are selected (i.e., once BRIC \nfunds are allocated to a State), FEMA cannot withdraw those funds unless they remain unobligated \nat “the end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal year for which the amounts were allocated.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(A). And even then, any withdrawn funds must be returned to the National \nPublic Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and reallocated to new BRIC projects the \nfollowing year. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(B). \n136.  Second, Congress has barred DHS and FEMA from repurposing grant funds in its \nappropriations Acts. In 2024, Congress instructed DHS and FEMA that “no funds shall be \nreprogrammed within or transferred between appropriations to increase or decrease funding for \ngrant programs,” and Congress has carried this restriction forward.55 So FEMA cannot take funds \nset aside for BRIC grants and spend them on other programs. See 6 U.S.C. § 316(d) (confirming \nthat Defendants are required to follow restrictions in appropriations Acts). \n137.  But FEMA revealed in June that in April it had initiated a “Reversal of Building \nInfrastructure and Communities Set Aside” and unlawfully diverted $4.071 billion out of the \nNational Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund portion of the Disaster Relief Fund into \n \n55 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub.

FEMA’s Termination of BRIC Has Caused, and Is Continuing to Cause, Irreparable \nHarm to Plaintiff States and Communities Around the Country \n138.  FEMA’s termination of the BRIC program has caused serious harm. Not only are \nStates unable to move forward with many of their planned projects, they also risk wasting the \nsubstantial time, effort, and money they have already invested in these projects, and undermining \nthe trust they have built with local communities and industry partners, which will make it harder \nto undertake projects like this in the future. Each day that passes causes more harm and increases \nthe chances that these projects will not be able to go forward, as communities face expiring permits, \nescalating costs, and eroding stakeholder trust. And since BRIC grants account for most of the \nfunding for these projects, if the termination is not reversed, many of these projects will have to \nbe scaled back, delayed, or canceled entirely. That would deprive communities around the country \nof the economic benefits these projects will bring and, most importantly, leave them more \nvulnerable to natural disasters for years to come. \n139.  The following are just a few examples of the projects that FEMA’s termination of \nthe BRIC program has put at risk. \n \n56  See  FEMA,  Disaster  Relief  Fund:  Monthly  Report  as  of  April  30,  2025  at  4  (2025), \nhttps://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ocfo_may-2025-disaster-relief-fund-report_06042025.pdf \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 37 of 83\n     \n \nWASHINGTON \nNorth Shore Leveee and North Shore Levee West \n140.  Located  on  Washington’s  rural  Western  coastline,  Aberdeen  and  Hoquiam’s \nworking-class communities have experienced decades of severe flooding caused by intense rainfall \nand coastal surges. As a direct response to these recurring disasters, Washington applied for BRIC \nfunding to construct concrete floodwalls, miles of earthen levees, and raised roadways that would \nprotect these communities from further damage. Once completed, these levees would protect 1,354 \nbusiness, 5,100 properties, and more than 3,000 jobs located in the designated flood zone. They \nwould also reduce construction and insurance costs, leaving more than $5 million per year in \nresidents’ pockets, and promote economic development and future investments. \n141.  FEMA selected the projects years ago, allocating $50 million to the North Shore \nLevee Project and $47.5 million to the North Shore Levee West Project. In anticipation of federal \nfunding, State and local partners invested over $31 million of their own funds in project design, \npermitting, and pre-construction work. After years of rigorous environmental review, Hoquiam’s \nNorth Shore Levee West project received a Finding of No Significant Impact from FEMA on \nMarch 25, 2025, which was the last step before the paperwork could be finalized and the project \ncould move forward. \n142.  But just days later, Defendants shut down the BRIC program, and it is now unclear \nif these projects will ever get built. These communities cannot fund the projects on their own, and \nwithout federal funds, they may need to cancel them entirely. If that were to occur, all the time, \neffort, and money the State and local partners invested in the project would be wasted, and the \ncommunity would likely continue to face recurrent severe flooding.  \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 38 of 83\n     \n \nGoldendale Emergency Preparedness Microgrid \n143.  Klickitat County is a rural community in southern Washington that frequently loses \npower during wildfires and severe weather. To help protect the community during power outages, \nWashington applied for a BRIC grant to construct a solar and battery microgrid that would allow \nthe local hospital and a nearby school district to generate their own electricity so that they could \nsupport critical operations even when the grid goes down. This emergency power source would \nensure that local residents can receive the medical care they need during emergencies while also \nproviding a sheltering place, with electricity, for more than 9,000 residents frequently at risk of \nlosing power. \n144.  FEMA selected the project and allocated more than $9 million toward it. Phase I \ndesign, final engineering estimates, and permitting were completed in March 2025, and the next \nstep was for a Phase II amendment, which would allow for construction to begin. But Defendants \nshut down the BRIC program a few weeks later, and without BRIC funding, this community will \nbe forced to scale back the project so much that the rural hospital will be unable to maintain many \nof its critical services during outage-causing events, and the school facility will not be fully \nequipped to provide safe and sanitary emergency sheltering. \nMASSACHUSETTS  \n145.  In Massachusetts, FEMA awarded almost $50 million in BRIC funds to the cities \nof Chelsea and Everett, for the Island End River Coastal Flood Resilience Project, the largest grant \nto the Commonwealth. This grant was a significant contribution to a $120 million project designed \naddress the catastrophic flooding of Island End River during severe coastal storms. The project \nwas intended to fund a $42 million underground storm surge control facility, 4,460 linear-foot \nstorm surge barrier, revamped riverwalk, and 18,000 square feet of nature-based resilience \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 39 of 83\n     \n \nimprovements that include wetland upgrades and a restored salt marsh. The loss of BRIC funding \nfor the Island End River Flood Barrier project puts at risk over $7 billion in annual economic \nactivity, access to the region’s supply of fresh produce, a major and vital transportation corridor, \nand the safety of more than 5,000 residents living in the floodplain.  \n146.  Also in Massachusetts, the Town of Manchester-by-the-Sea was awarded almost \n$5 million in BRIC funds to replace the town’s Central Street Bridge and remove a collapsing \nculvert. The existing Central Street Bridge, which serves a major roadway and is the town’s main \nthoroughfare, currently overtops during extreme storms and is structurally deficient. A culvert \nfailure would have major consequences to transportation and community safety including response \ntimes for emergency services, impacts to schools, transportation of goods and services, access to \ngovernment services, and loss of utility services for all of Cape Ann as this bridge carries the entire \nelectric supply to all four Cape Ann towns. \nARIZONA \n147.  Between  2020  and  2023,  Arizona  was  selected  for  25  BRIC  grants,  totaling \n$9.8 million dollars. Roughly $1.2 million of these funds were directed to the State for salaries and \nother management costs. Because of the BRIC termination, Arizona will not receive the full \namount of state management costs.  \n148.  The  remaining  BRIC  funding  supports  critical  disaster  mitigation  projects, \nincluding a $4.6 million infrastructure project in the City of Buckeye, Arizona. The City regularly \nexperience floods that threaten the safety of its businesses and families. The BRIC funding would \nhave been used to divert floodwater away from the historic downtown by connecting the drainage \nsystem to existing irrigation canals and constructing a retention basin to collect the floodwater. \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 40 of 83\n     \n \n149.  The Town of Camp Verde, Arizona was similarly selected for a roughly $860,000 \nBRIC grant to secure a major roadway against flooding. The roadway, Verde Lakes Drive, \nsustained significant damage from floods in March 2023, resulting in a declaration of emergency \nin Camp Verde. The BRIC grant would fund flood mitigation improvements and secure the area \nagainst flooding. \n150.  Arizona does not have the budgetary resources or flexibility to make up for the lost \nfunding without drawing funding away from other important initiatives. Without BRIC funding, \nArizona is facing an increased risk of lost lives, property damage, and public safety burdens. \nCALIFORNIA \n151.  FEMA selected the City of Rancho Palos Verdes’ subapplication for a $32.99 \nmillion project under the BRIC program. That grant would have funded a project to reduce \ngeologic landslide movement that threatens most of the City’s residents and infrastructure, \nincluding a major arterial roadway that provides community and emergency access, sanitation \nsewer lines located along this roadway, electric and communication lines, potable water lines, and \ngas lines. The project would reduce risk of sudden/major land movement that could cause the \nabove infrastructure to fail and threaten over 15,000 homes and nearly 40,000 people. This \nlandslide movement involves one of the largest continuously active landslides in the United States \nand has already resulted in significant damage. With this project, the City could take important \nsteps to stop or slow this ongoing movement. But without this project, this landslide movement \nwill continue to threaten critical infrastructure, damage homes and property, and endanger lives. \nThe landslide movement is irreversible after it occurs. \n152.  FEMA selected the City of Sacramento’s subapplication for a $21.36 million \nproject under the BRIC program. The grant would have funded a project to mitigate flooding of \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 41 of 83\n     \n \nfive major interchanges, 3.9 miles of a major interstate highway, a runway at an airport, surface \nstreets, 27,000 housing units, and more. Among other things, the project would have improved \nfloodwall sections, improved levee sections, and relocated a pump station. The U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers considers the Sacramento region to be one of the most at-risk regions, if not the most \nat-risk region, in the country for “catastrophic” flooding, noting that it relies on an aging system \nto reduce its flood risk. \n153.  FEMA selected Kern County’s subapplication for a $32.39 million project under \nthe BRIC program. The grant would have funded a project to seismically retrofit the Kern Valley \nHealthcare District’s hospital that provides acute care and emergency medical services to a remote \npopulation in the mid-northern region of the Kern River Valley area. Unless seismically retrofitted, \nthe hospital may soon need to close. This would force hundreds of thousands of Californians to \nseek services at hospitals over two hours away. \nCOLORADO \nCity of Greeley Goldhill Pipeline Project \n154.  This project, which was Identified for Further Review in BRIC FY 2022, would \nprotect the City of Greeley’s water supply against climate-related and human-made hazards. \nGreeley  relies  on  two  water  treatment  plants,  but  the  current  transmission  system  lacks  a \nconnection between the two plants, making the system vulnerable to water shortages and rationing \nif one plant needs to be taken offline. The proposed project would have built a pipeline to allow \ntreated water to flow in both directions between the plants, thereby increasing flexibility in water \nmanagement, maximizing the benefits of diversified water sources, and making sure the system \ncan respond effectively to the hazards of wildfire, drought, and cyberattack. The Greeley project \nwould have benefitted 152,861 residents of Greeley, Windsor, Milliken, and Evans along with \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 42 of 83\n     \n \napproximately 6,000 students at the University of Northern Colorado. Between 40 and 50 percent \nof the benefitting population is considered vulnerable under multiple socio-economic factors. The \ntotal cost of the Greeley project is $18,425,795.28. If the project had moved forward under the \nBRIC program, FEMA would have contributed $13,819,346.46 of the costs. \nCONNECTICUT \n155.  The BRIC 2022 Resilient Bridgeport Coastal Flood Defense System (“Resilient \nBridgeport”) was developed to address recurrent flooding and coastal storm surge risks affecting \nBridgeport’s South End, an area repeatedly impacted by major storm events. Bridgeport is \nConnecticut’s most populous city and the fifth largest city in New England. It sits at the mouth of \nthe Pequonnock River on Long Island Sound and houses the I-95 corridor, one of the busiest \ninterstate thoroughfares connecting the New York metropolitan area with New England. \n156.  The key project objectives included: protecting approximately 65 acres within the \n100-year  floodplain  from  storm  surge,  flooding,  and  future  sea  level  rise  (up  to  2.5  feet); \nsafeguarding  two  critical  power-generating  facilities  capable  of  supplying  electricity  to \napproximately  1.1  million  homes;  constructing  comprehensive  flood  defense  infrastructure, \nincluding floodwalls, raised roads, stormwater management systems, and a proposed resilience \nhub; and reducing long-term flood risk, displacement, and infrastructure damage, while enhancing \nemergency response capabilities. \n157.  The BRIC project termination means not only a loss of the anticipated $47 million \nin BRIC program funds, but that Bridgeport’s South End remains fully exposed to future flooding \nevents. This unmitigated flood risk impacts residential communities, including low-income and \nvulnerable populations. There is an ongoing vulnerability of two major power generation facilities, \nrisking widespread power outages affecting over 1 million homes.  \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 43 of 83\n     \n \nDELAWARE \n158.  The Delaware Emergency Management Agency was forced to cancel 11 projects \nas a result of the cancelation of the BRIC Program. Among the canceled projects, was a project to \nimprove storm water management in Lewes, Delaware. Flooding events in this area may result in \nlarge scale losses including causing damage to structures and homes. In addition, failure to \nproperly mitigate flood waters in this area could result in eliminating access to homes, disruption \nof  water  and  sanitary  and  sewer  services,  and  have  additional  determinantal  impacts  on \ndownstream roads, residences, and business. The purpose of this now canceled project was to \ncreate infrastructure to avoid stormwater runoff inundation on downstream streets and properties. \n159.  The cancellation of the BRIC program is devastating for Delaware. In addition to \nthe lost federal funding, DEMA and its subgrantees have invested time, study, and their own \nfinancial  resources  into  planning,  design,  public  engagement,  environmental  review,  and \npermitting for BRIC projects intended to protect communities and critical infrastructure from \nnatural disasters and extreme weather events. Moreover, each BRIC project requires conducting a \nrigorous cost-benefit analysis that ensures the project will be cost-effective. That time and effort \nand those financial resources will be wasted if FEMA will not consider or fund these projects. \n160.  Many of the BRIC projects in Delaware cannot move forward without BRIC \nfunding. As a result of the termination of the BRIC program, Delaware is facing an increased risk \nof lost lives, property damage, and public safety burdens. Delaware does not have the budgetary \nresources or flexibility to make up for the lost funding without drawing funding away from other \nimportant initiatives. \nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 44 of 83\n     \n \n161.  The District of Columbia receives tens of millions of dollars in BRIC funding for \nprojects intended to mitigate against various threats and hazards, such as flooding and extreme \nheat. For example, the District of Columbia has been selected to receive BRIC funding for the \nEastern Avenue and Deane Avenue Stormwater Pump Station Power Resiliency Projects, which \nfloodproof and improve infrastructure to protect stormwater pump stations from power outages \nduring multi-hazard events. With these enhancements, these pumps will continue to operate and \npump water and wastewater for the community even when there is flooding in the area. The total \nfederal funding for these projects is approximately $2.13 million, which FEMA will no longer \naward to the District. \n162.  As a consequence of the BRIC termination, the District has not received final grant \nagreements for 7 BRIC projects for Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023 that had been selected but not yet \nawarded at the time of the BRIC termination, totaling $8.5 million of federal funding. In addition, \nthe District had 3 phased projects in the BRIC programs for Fiscal Years 2020 and 2021 that had \nbeen awarded for phase 1 design and planning work, but had not yet been awarded phase 2 \nconstruction funding. To date, FEMA has not approved these projects to enter phase 2 and unless \nthe BRIC termination is reversed, they will not be completed as planned. The loss of phase 2 \nconstruction funding totals $49.5 million of federal funding. \n163.  As a result of the termination of the BRIC program, the District of Columbia is \nfacing an increased risk of lost lives, property damage, and public safety burdens related to \nincreasing occurrence of severe storms, flooding, and heat waves in the District. \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 45 of 83\n     \n \nILLINOIS \n164.  Two of the subgrantees selected for BRIC funding in Illinois from Federal Fiscal \nYears 2020 through 2023, are the Village of DePue, and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation \nDistrict of Greater Chicago (MWRD), which were awarded grant funding for specific flood \nmitigation projects. These two projects are crucial for major critical infrastructure protections for \nresidents of the State of Illinois, including agriculture and healthcare infrastructure. \n165.  The Village of DePue is a Central Illinois community of approximately 1,600 \nresidents in Bureau County on the shores of Lake DePue and near the Illinois River. DePue must \nmove its vulnerable wastewater treatment plant out of a FEMA recognized regulatory floodway to \nreduce the risk of catastrophic flooding of this critical infrastructure and mitigate the risk of \nsignificant public health, environmental, and economic harm. Relocation is essential to safeguard \nclean drinking water for the community, prevent raw sewage from backing into homes, and protect \nagainst contamination of Lake DePue—a national powerboat championship site—and the Illinois \nRiver, which affect downstream communities including Peoria, Hennepin, and Pekin, along with \nregional farms and rural manufacturing. The wastewater treatment plant has already faced severe \nhistorical flooding, with the Illinois River nearly breaching its levee in 2008 and 2013. \n166.  BRIC funding is critical for this project not only because of present and future risk, \nbut also due to DePue's historical environmental and economic challenges as the city is home to a \nSuperfund Site from early 20th-century zinc smelting and fertilizer production that left toxic waste \nin the community and that limits the City’s available resources to address on-going environmental \nchallenges.  Moving  the  plant  will  protect  public  health,  the  environment,  and  the  region's \neconomy. \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 46 of 83\n     \n \n167.  Another BRIC funded project in Illinois, the MWRD project, seeks to reduce major \nflooding of critical infrastructure in the Des Plaines River Valley by addressing a growing and \ncostly flood risk within the Prairie Creek sub-watershed. Past floods include a 1986 event that \ncaused an estimated $35 million in damage and forced over 15,000 evacuations, as well as \nsignificant historical flooding of this sub-watershed in August 2007, September 2008, and April \n2013, which demonstrate an ongoing threat to the community. \n168.  The MWRD project aims to directly reduce the risk of such widespread disruption \nin the Des Plaines River Valley communities, including Maine Township, Park Ridge, and Des \nPlaines, Illinois. It is also essential to safeguard a vital healthcare lifeline by protecting critical \naccess routes to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, a Level I Trauma Center and one of the \nlargest hospitals in the Chicago area. Advocate Lutheran General provides comprehensive and \nspecialized  care  to  serve  the  healthcare  needs  of  tens  of  thousands  of  residents  across  28 \ncommunities within Chicago, Cook County, and Lake County, Illinois. Ensuring uninterrupted \naccess to this facility during a flood is critical for the health and safety of the hospital’s extensive \nservice population. \nKENTUCKY \n \n169.  The Division of Emergency Management is the recipient (or grantee) of grants from \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and also serves as a pass-through agency \nfor awards made by FEMA to eligible Kentucky applicants (or subgrantees). \n170.  The Division of Emergency Management and its subgrantees have 13 open projects \nselected for BRIC funding. The termination of the BRIC program leaves the Commonwealth with \n13 projects unfunded for a total amount of $18,241,576.13 that the Commonwealth was selected \nto receive. If the BRIC termination is not reversed, these projects will not be completed. The \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 47 of 83\n     \n \nCommonwealth  will  also  not  receive  the  $2,394,625  in  BRIC  program  funding  for  2023 \nmanagement costs that it was selected to receive.  \n171.  The City of Frankfort, the location of Kentucky’s capitol, is bisected by the \nKentucky River. In April of 2025, the Kentucky River flooded at the second highest level in the \ncity’s history. This event caused multiple deaths, destroyed many homes, and impacted hundreds \nof residences, businesses, and government buildings. Through BRIC Phase 1 funding awarded in \n2021, Frankfort has worked tirelessly with engineers and flood experts to identify the most \neffective flood protection for the city. The $10.5 million Phase 2 project to construct the protective \nfeatures was scheduled to be awarded through BRIC upon completion of Phase 1 in 2025, but the \nCommonwealth and the city were notified in April of 2025 that the funding was cancelled. The \nflood recovery costs now facing the city have depleted any fiscal capability to put any of the Phase \n2 measures in place, leaving Frankfort citizens still gravely vulnerable. The Commonwealth has \nmore miles of running water than all states, except Alaska. \n172.  The 13 cancelled BRIC projects totaling $18,241,576.13 are initiatives central to \nflood protection, of which six are for small, rural, impoverished communities with massive needs \nand scarce resources. The urban applications are for projects targeted to protect impoverished areas \nof those communities. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is committed to the purpose and mission \nof BRIC. Realizing the fiscal challenges of mitigation applicants, the Commonwealth provides \n48% of the match required of subgrantees. The deadly floods in Kentucky vividly illustrate the \nneed for mitigation measures that will protect vulnerable citizens and their communities. \n173.  The  termination  of  BRIC  ends  the  resources  needed  to  create  resilience  and \nprotection for at-risk areas. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of these unfunded Kentucky mitigation \nprojects and applications would have provided warning sirens, flood control measures, emergency \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 48 of 83\n     \n \ngenerators, and building inspection and code enforcement measures. Kentucky does not have the \nbudgetary resources or flexibility to make up the lost funding without drawing funding away from \nother important initiatives. \nMAINE \nYork County Coastal Sand Dune Restoration and Protection Initiative \n \n174.  In January 2024, coastal flooding in southern Maine caused $70 million in damage \nto public and private property and infrastructure. The flooding destroyed large stretches of \ncoastline, which is a critical resource for both Maine residents and its tourism industry, which is a \nvital part of the State’s economy. In addition to the immediate damage, the flooding caused \nsignificant destruction of the dunes that provide a protective buffer for coastal properties, leaving \nthem even more vulnerable to future storms. In response and with the support of BRIC funding, \nthe York County Emergency Management Agency developed a BRIC application for the York \nCounty Coastal Sand Dune Restoration and Protection Initiative to commence a comprehensive \nphased project to rebuild dunes and widen beaches in a climate-resilient way. The project is \nintended to better protect critical infrastructure, homes, and businesses from future storms. With \nthe cancellation of BRIC FY24, the region lost $41.4 million in potential funding. Without \nengineering studies and mitigation efforts, these communities remain exposed to worsening storm \nimpacts. \nMARYLAND \n \n175.  In  Maryland,  the  City  of  Crisfield  had  been  working  on  community-driven \nsolutions to its longstanding and severe flooding challenges for years. The City of Crisfield was \nan inaugural recipient of the Direct Technical Assistance program in the FFY20 BRIC cycle. This \nno-cost assistance included a three-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the City \nand FEMA, which assisted the City in developing and scoping a major flood resilience project \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 49 of 83\n     \n \ndesigned to address significant vulnerability in the City Dock and surrounding areas. The City of \nCrisfield was one of five localities in Maryland that benefitted from the DTA program from fiscal \nyears 2021-2023, and led to Crisfield's completion of two competitive applications for flood \nmitigation BRIC grants. Neither of those applications made it past FEMA's review stage, however, \ndue to FEMA's premature cancellation of the program and withdrawal of the FY24 NOFO. \n176.  The City of Crisfield applied for BRIC funds in FFY23 and was later selected for \nfurther review by FEMA, a promising sign for the community which holds a high-risk score of \n85.36 on FEMA’s National Risk Index. One of the projects, if approved, would offer $36 million \nin federal funds, which would be transformational to the flood mitigation efforts of the city, which \nwas founded in 1663 and is home to 2,475 residents today. FEMA’s termination of the BRIC \nprogram now puts the City of Crisfield’s entire flood mitigation project at risk, since many of the \nnon-federal resources the city leveraged to meet its expected federal cost-share responsibilities \nrequired the city to have a comprehensive funding plan in place, which includes the expected \nfederal BRIC funds. \n177.  At  least  two  DTA  participants  in  Maryland,  in  the  counties  of  Dorchester \n(Cambridge) and Somerset (Princess Anne), were just selected for the program in FY23. Those \ncounties only had their initial in-person Needs Assessment meetings between FEMA, MDEM, and \ncounty officials in January of 2025, which is the first step in the development of a formal Needs \nAssessment, a key goal of the DTA program and prerequisite for BRIC funding. Upon information \nand belief, neither of these reports were finalized or delivered to the counties, and no further \nmeetings have been held since FEMA announced its termination of the BRIC program on April 4, \n2025. But for the termination of the BRIC program, the cities and counties participating in the \nDTA program at the time of the announcement believed that assistance would continue. \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 50 of 83\n     \n \nMICHIGAN \n \n178.  Many of Michigan’s BRIC projects are poised to have significant impact on disaster \nreduction in the state if allowed to be completed. Flood reduction/Stormwater infrastructure \nprojects in Southeast Michigan are a prime example. Stormwater related flooding in this area has \nresulted in costly federal disaster declarations in 2000, 2014, and 2021. These BRIC projects, one \nfor the City of Detroit and one for the City of Hamtramck, were projects to improve the stormwater \ninfrastructure in those communities to help prevent stormwater flooding disasters in the future.  \n179.  A $2,000,000 award to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory’s \nBureau of Construction Codes that would have funded a dedicated project team to assess the needs \nof local governments and building inspectors to identify gaps in code inspectors’ knowledge of \nbuilding codes as Michigan transitions through the adoption of the 2021 and 2024 suites of \nbuilding codes developed by the International Code Council (“ICC”) and adopted by the State. \nThe project team intended to use this needs assessment to develop educational materials on the \nlatest building codes adopted by the state and deliver training and outreach programs to enhance \ncode knowledge and compliance of building inspectors, design professionals, and contractors. The \nfunding was also to be used to purchase enhanced code materials and analysis published by the \nICC for inspectors in the bureau and working in local units of government to improve and ensure \nthe consistency of code application in plan reviews and inspections. Additionally, the project team \nintended to work partner organizations to develop the skilled workforce needed by the state and \nlocal units of government to enforce building codes across the state. \nMINNESOTA \n180.  In the State of Minnesota, BRIC funding is primarily used by counties to update \ntheir hazard mitigation plans on a five-year cycle. At the time of writing, terminated BRIC funding \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 51 of 83\n     \n \nwas slated to support thirty-four Minnesota counties in updating their current plans. The process \nof updating a plan requires substantial time and resources to ensure the inclusion of accurate, \nquantifiable data. BRIC funding enables jurisdictions to engage qualified consultants to support \nand guide this process. The hazard mitigation plans serve as foundational documents that provide \njurisdictions with a comprehensive understanding of their current threat and risk landscape, and \nthey outline specific strategies to reduce or eliminate risks associated with identified hazards. \nMoreover, these plans are a federal requirement for jurisdictions seeking eligibility for post-\ndisaster assistance, as outlined in Section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. § 5165. Disrupting these plans will have compounding \nnegative consequences for Minnesota residents during and post-disaster. \nNEW JERSEY \nNJWSA Spruce Run Dam Foundation Grouting Project \n181.  New Jersey is using BRIC funds to strengthen the Spruce Run Reservoir Dam, part \nof the Raritan Basin System that supplies water to 1.5 million residents. The project will protect \napproximately 249,000 people and associated infrastructure by restoring the dam’s integrity, \npreventing potential dam failure, and reducing downstream flood risk from this Class 1 High \nHazard Potential Dam, which stores 11 billion gallons of water. \nPANYNJ Elevation-Floodproofing of Building 111 Infrastructure Mitigation \n182.  New Jersey is also using BRIC funds to elevate and floodproof critical electrical \nand mechanical systems at Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal’s primary water and fire pump \nstation. The project will benefit over 20,000 port workers and protect hundreds of critical structures \nby ensuring uninterrupted firefighting, potable water, and transportation operations at one of the \nnation’s busiest ports. \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 52 of 83\n     \n \nNEW MEXICO \n \n183.  New Mexico has 16 open BRIC projects from Federal Fiscal Years 2020 through \n2023 in the amount of over $4.36 million. \n184.  New Mexico BRIC projects have included flood, wildfire, storm/weather impacts, \ndrought and earthquake mitigation type projects.  For example, FEMA allocated $540,263.60 to \none New Mexico BRIC project for a City of Santa Fe storm water drainage project that focuses on \ndiverting  storm  water  from  a  city  park  and  adjoining  high-density  lower  middle-class \nneighborhoods. \n185.  New Mexico’s Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management \n(“DHSEM”) had prepared a detailed list of potential applications for the 2024 NOFO that \nencompassed 83 eligible projects, with estimated costs exceeding $100 million competitive and \n$2 million state set-aside/allocated for state-wide implementation of building codes and standards. \nThe cancellation of the 2024 NOFO denied DHSEM the opportunity to submit these projects for \nconsideration. \n186.  Additionally, DHSEM had four projects totaling over $2 million that FEMA had \nselected but not awarded as part of the 2023 BRIC grant cycle.  Those projects include an \napplication from DHSEM and New Mexico Department of Health to update plans to mitigate \nextreme temperatures and fire for over $920,000, and an application from the Pueblo of Acoma to \ndevelop or conduct engineering regarding flooding risk for over $869,000.  At the time of FEMA’s \nApril 2025 announcement canceling BRIC, it was expected based on past cycles that FEMA would \nexpedite its reviews and clear them for award. \n187.  The impact of the termination of the BRIC program on New Mexico is exacerbated \nbecause  of  recent  reductions  in  FEMA  funding  to  NM  DHSEM  through  FEMA’s  Hazard \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 53 of 83\n     \n \nMitigation Grant Program (HMGP). On July 28, 2025, NM DHSEM received notice from FEMA \nthat multiple applications for HMGP funding would be cut by 44%, totaling tens of millions of \ndollars, including funding for wildfires and post-wildfire flooding.     \nNEW YORK \n \n188.  New York is slated to receive $50 million from the BRIC program for the Seaport \nCostal Resilience Project (project number EMN-2021-BR-069-0012 ) (SCRP), a multi-phased \nproject57 aimed at protecting (i) New York City residents and (ii) City property and infrastructure \nfrom the risks associated with rising sea levels, increased rain events, and the impact of extreme \nheat, all of which are exacerbated by climate change. The Project would reduce flood risk through \ninnovative design and engineering strategies that will integrate flood protection into a public \nesplanade and historic district, improve access to the waterfront, and implement green and nature-\nbased solutions to improve marine habitat and address the urban heat island effect. The Project \nwill directly protect 91 buildings, including New York City Housing Authority buildings, and \ncritical transportation routes in the Financial District. Further, SCRP will be integrated into a \nbroader infrastructure project, the “Big U,” aimed at protecting lower Manhattan from the climate \nchange impacts of floodwater and stormwater events. The cost-benefit calculation of SCRP, \nincluding mitigations, is more than $681 million in benefits. In April 2025, the City sought, but \nhad not yet received a response, to an extension request to complete the grant activities associated \nwith SCRP. \n189.  New York State has 31 open BRIC projects totaling $244,526,656 benefiting the \nCity of New York and other municipalities throughout the State, with an additional 7 projects \n \n57 Phase 1 of the project (appx. 7.5mm) includes environmental reviews, regulatory and permitting \napprovals, design completion and stakeholder engagement; phase 2 of the project (appx. 43mm) includes the \nimplementation of the project. \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 54 of 83\n     \n \ntotaling $138,008,847 from the BRIC 2022 and 2023 grant cycles that have been selected but not \nyet awarded. These projects are  all in jeopardy of being defunded  as a result of FEMA’s \nconstructive termination of the BRIC program. If FEMA does not extend periods of performance \nor approve additional project phases, it will significantly impact the State’s ability to prepare for \ndisasters and prevent loss of life and property resulting from hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, or other \nnatural hazards. \n190.  For  example,  the  BRIC  funding  is  being  used  for  the  Upper  Minkel  Dam \nDecommissioning and Riparian Corridor Restoration project. This project would remove the \nUpper Minkel Dam, a high hazard Class \"C\" Dam in Westchester County, and restore the stream \nand surrounding land which would significantly reduce the potential flood hazard associated with \nthe dam. The design will allow for a low flow channel into Purdy Pond and includes a higher \nelevation flood storage shelf that will reduce, and possibly eliminate, future flood events. The \nTown of New Castle will not be able to complete the project if FEMA does not approve Phase 2 \nconstruction. \n191.  New York State received 37 applications from 26 State and local subapplicants \ntotaling $290 million that it intended to submit to FEMA in response to the BRIC 2024 NOFO. \nNORTH CAROLINA \n \n192.  Rowan County and the City of Salisbury, North Carolina have experienced multi-\nday shutdowns of the pump station that provides drinking water to over 50,000 of their residents \nbecause of flooding and hazardous conditions at the station. The City of Salisbury was selected for \na FY 2021 BRIC grant of approximately $22.5 million, which would improve water supply \nresiliency by relocating the pump station to an area where it could be safely accessed during \nstorms. The City of Salisbury has invested over $3 million in engineering fees alone for the project. \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 55 of 83\n     \n \nFEMA obligated funds for this project but then cancelled the BRIC program before construction \ncould begin. The sudden withdrawal of funds for the project imperils its future. \nOREGON \n193.  BRIC funding is administered in Oregon by the Oregon Department of Emergency \nManagement (OEM)—a state agency that coordinates and maintains a statewide emergency \nservices system for emergency and disaster communications. Oregon and its subgrantees have 29 \nopen projects selected for BRIC funding in the amount of $128,736,327.  \n194.  For example, a project in Oregon’s Clatsop County was selected for BRIC funding \nto assist with tsunami and earthquake preparedness. Clatsop County includes a substantial portion \nof the Oregon coastline, which is especially vulnerable to a potential earthquake and tsunami \ncaused by the Cascadia Subduction Zone. The project in Clatstop County seeks to integrate a \nTsunami Vertical Evacuation Refuge Structure into a community hospital. This would create a \nmulti-purpose structure to provide a shelter for the hospital patients and staff, as well as members \nof the general population in the hospital’s immediate vicinity, that is elevated level above the \npredicted tsunami inundation levels. The total estimated cost of this project is $19,853,032, of \nwhich the federal government was expected to contribute $13,897,122 through BRIC. BRIC’s \ntermination places the impending construction phase of this project in jeopardy; neither the County \nnor the State can afford to resume the project without federal funding. \n195.  BRIC’s termination would also imperil a project to improve the Medford Water \nCommission’s water distribution system. That project seeks to improve the system’s resilience to \nseismic  risk,  wildfires,  and  droughts  by  creating  a  “backbone”  water  supply  for  critical \ninfrastructure in the City of Medford and the surrounding area. This project was selected for \n$34,806,505 in BRIC funding, and in a site visit late last year, FEMA staff indicated that the grant \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 56 of 83\n     \n \nwas on track for those funds to be obligated by the summer of 2025. The potential loss of those \nfunds would imperil the broader project’s scope which, in its entirety, will cost four times the \namount of the federally-funded portion. \n196.  BRIC’s termination also imperils an effort to relocate the City of Grants Pass’s \nexisting water treatment plant outside of a special flood hazard area and replace it with a facility \nthat is resistant to seismic activity, drought, and extreme weather. An application seeking $50 \nmillion of BRIC funds for this project was selected for funding, and based on a meeting with \nFEMA in late 2024, the community anticipated that federal funds would be obligated by summer \nof 2025. \n197.  OEM has also invested substantial state administrative resources—including three \nfull-time employees along with private, contracted consultants—to help bridge the gap between \nsmaller Oregon communities seeking BRIC funding and larger communities with more resources. \nBRIC’s termination would leave OEM with roughly $200,000 of uncompensated costs resulting \nfrom these efforts that otherwise would have been reimbursed by federal funds. This would place \na significant unanticipated strain on OEM’s resources. \nPENNSYLVANIA \n \n198.  Pennsylvania had 47 projects competitively selected between FY2020 and FY2023 \nthat have now been terminated. The federal share for these projects was over $130 million. \nPennsylvania is one of 16 states with an Enhanced Hazard Mitigation Plan and the selected projects \nwere pieces of Pennsylvania’s enhanced mitigation strategy. \n199.  One $2 million award would have allowed the placement of a HESCO flood barrier \nin the Eastwick neighborhood of Southwest Philadelphia. Eastwick is a residential neighborhood \nwith about 12,000 people that sits along the Delaware River. It has repeatedly experienced losses \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 57 of 83\n     \n \nbecause of flooding. The barrier was a critical piece of a larger scale mitigation strategy being \nimplemented  by  Pennsylvania,  the  City  of  Philadelphia,  the  United  States  Army  Corps  of \nEngineers, United States Fish & Wildlife, and FEMA.   \n200.  In advance of the $2 million award, the City of Philadelphia was a recipient of \nFEMA’s non-financial DTA program. This no-cost assistance included a three-year Memorandum \nof Understanding (MOU) between the City and FEMA, which has assisted the City in developing \nand scoping solutions to address sea level-rising flooding in the Eastwick neighborhood. The City \nof Philadelphia was still receiving DTA immediately prior to FEMA’s termination of the BRIC \nprogram. Following the announcement of BRIC’s termination, that assistance prematurely ended.   \n201.  Two separate $50 million awards would have supported two Philadelphia Water \nDepartment pump stations. One of those awards would have been used to build gates to prevent \nflood water from entering the 42nd Street pump station, increased that pump station’s capacity \nfrom 8 million gallons per day to 100 million gallons per day, and improved its operational quality \nfor both normal and storm operations. Those enhancements would have delivered better water \nservice to the local community, reduced overflows into the Schuylkill River, and better protected \nthe neighborhood from flooding impacts. The second award, for which Philadelphia committed to \novermatch the federal award, would have achieved similar ends in Northeast Philadelphia.  \n202.  Yet another award for about $2.7 million would have been used to acquire and \ndemolish  21  properties  in  Scranton—a  community  of  around  80,000—that  have  sustained \nrepetitive flood losses. Scranton intended to eliminate future losses for the homeowners and return \nthe parcels to their natural state \n203.  Two awards selected for FY2022, for which the federal share totaled more than $10 \nmillion, would have significantly contributed to mitigating flood impacts sustained over the years \n57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 58 of 83\n     \n \nin Dover Township, York County and Bridgeville Borough, Allegheny County. The mitigation \nproject in Dover, a township with about 22,000 people, would have enhanced the flood storage \nand attenuation capacity of Little Conewago Creek. The Bridgeville Borough award was part of \nan effort to upsize stormwater culverts, install two screw pumps, install initial levee walls, and \nperform grading to create additional capacity for Chartiers Creek. Most of Bridgeville Borough’s \n5,000 residents live near the project area. \n204.  Pennsylvania,  through  the  Pennsylvania  Emergency  Management  Agency \n(PEMA), and local government sub-applicants had invested significant time and money into \npreparing applications for each of BRIC’s application periods. \n205.  Pennsylvania also was ready to apply for 22 projects for FY2024, seeking more \nthan $25 million from FEMA. \nRHODE ISLAND \n206.  The University of Rhode Island (URI) and its subgrantees have 1 open project \nselected for BRIC funding from Federal Fiscal Years 2020 through 2023 in the amount of \n$348,978.18. This project is called Seamless Web-based Flood Risk Mapping Tool for Coastal \nand Inland Waters of RI in a Changing Climate; extension of STORMTOOLS using FEMA maps \nand hydrological modeling.  \n207.  URI’s BRIC project cannot move forward without BRIC funding. As a result of the \ntermination of the BRIC program, Rhode Island will have less data and information regarding \ninland flooding and inland flood risk. Additionally, due to the loss of future funding opportunities \nwithout the BRIC program, Rhode Island is facing an increased risk of lost lives, property damage, \nand public safety burdens due to a loss of ability to predict and model storms.  \nVERMONT \n58 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 59 of 83\n     \n \n208.  In Vermont, BRIC funding has been predominately used for planning and scoping \nactivities. Planning funding is typically for the development of Local Hazard Mitigation Plans \n(LHMPs). These plans are required to apply for funding under all FEMA Hazard Mitigation \nAssistance  (HMA)  programs.  Scoping  projects  are  to  complete  design  work  and  develop \ninfrastructure applications. Annual BRIC funding allowed Vermont communities to plan future \nrisk reduction for all natural hazards and to design flood reduction projects to ensure readiness \nfollowing disasters. \n209.  For example, a Lower Whetstone Brook Project Scoping Study in Brattleboro, \nVermont, totaling $127,760 (federal share), has previously been selected under this grant and has \nnow been cancelled. This project was developed to assess floodplain restoration opportunities in a \nstretch of river with the potential to significantly reduce flood levels during high-flow storm events \nin a heavily populated downtown area.  \n210.  Another project, Flat Iron Bridge Project Scoping in Wolcott, Vermont, totaling \n$71,250, has previously been selected under this grant in Vermont and has now been cancelled. \nThis project would greatly benefit a community that experienced heavy flooding in Vermont’s \nJuly 2023 major flood event by developing plans to upsize their infrastructure and reduce flood \nrisk to residents. \nWISCONSIN \n211.  In Wisconsin, the Potosi School District was selected to receive $2,736,800 in \nFY22 for a community tornado shelter to provide near-absolute life safety protection for 886 \noccupants against 250 mile per hour wind speeds. The nearby Village of Cuba City was selected \nto receive $8,319,451 in FY22 to construct a multi-use tornado shelter, rated to provide near-\nabsolute life safety protection for 2,333 occupants against 250 mile per hour wind speeds. Both \n59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 60 of 83\n     \n \nprojects had undergone a lengthy and thorough FEMA review and were ready for obligation by \nFEMA prior to the cancellation of the BRIC program. The communities of Potosi and Cuba City \nhad also passed referenda to secure matching funds for the grants. \n212.  Potosi and Cuba City, where tornado safe room projects were cancelled, lie in an \narea of Wisconsin that is among the highest risk for tornadoes. The county has averaged a tornado \nevery year since 1950. In 2024, a tornado touched down only 1.4 miles away from the planned \nsafe room in Potosi. \n213.  The Town of Whitestown, located along the Kickapoo River in one of the most \nflood-prone areas of the state, was selected to receive $131,366 in FY23 to protect a bridge against \nscouring during flooding events. The Kickapoo River is prone to flooding annually and regularly \ncauses damage to the communities along its riverbanks. Record-setting rainfall of 12 or more \ninches in some areas caused major flooding down the entire span of the river in August 2018. \nWithout the Town of Whitestown bridge improvements, the bridge will become impassable during \nthe next flooding event, leaving residents stranded from emergency police, fire, and EMS services. \nScouring could also eventually lead to bridge collapse. This project had likewise undergone a \nlengthy  and  thorough  FEMA  review  and  was  ready  for  obligation  by  FEMA  prior  to  the \ncancellation of the BRIC program. \nV.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Separation of Powers \n(Termination of BRIC Program – Substantially Reducing Mitigation Functions) \n \n214.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 61 of 83\n     \n \n215.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc, \n575 U.S. 320, 326–27 (2015). \n216.  The Constitution provides that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.  \n217.  Executive Branch agencies’ “power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively \nprescribed by Congress.” City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013). That means an \nagency “literally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it,” La. \nPub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986), and that an agency “may not ignore \nstatutory mandates or prohibitions merely because of policy disagreement with Congress,” In re \nAiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n218.  Congress has not authorized Defendants to terminate the BRIC program. \n219.  In fact, Congress has prohibited it: Congress barred Defendants from “substantially \nor  significantly”  reducing  “the  authorities,  responsibilities,  or  functions  of  [FEMA]  or  the \ncapability  of  the  Agency  to  perform  those  missions,  authorities,  responsibilities,  except  as \notherwise specifically provided in an Act enacted after October 4, 2006.” 6 U.S.C. § 316(c)(1).  \n220.  Congress has expressly provided by law that mitigating against future disasters is, \nand must remain, one of FEMA’s core functions: FEMA’s “primary mission . . . is to reduce the \nloss  of  life  and  property  and  protect  the  Nation  from  all  hazards”  through  “a  risk-based, \ncomprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, \nand mitigation.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(1) (emphasis added). \n221.  And Congress instructed that the “Administrator shall provide Federal leadership \nnecessary to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, or mitigate against, a natural \n61 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 62 of 83\n     \n \ndisaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster, including . . . by leading and supporting the \nNation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of mitigation, by taking \nsustained actions to reduce or eliminate long-term risks to people and property from hazards and \ntheir effects.” 6 U.S.C. § 314(a)(9)(A) (emphasis added). \n222.  Congress  has  not  enacted  any  statute  “after  October  4,  2006”  “specifically” \nauthorizing Defendants to terminate the BRIC program or reduce FEMA’s mitigation functions \nand capabilities. \n223.  Defendants’ shuttering of FEMA’s flagship pre-disaster mitigation program and \nwithholding of billions of dollars intended for pre-disaster mitigation runs afoul of these laws.  \n224.  Congress determined decades ago, when it codified the pre-disaster mitigation \nprogram, that FEMA’s existing mitigation programs alone were not sufficient to fulfill FEMA’s \nmitigation mission. And Congress reaffirmed BRIC’s importance in 2018, when it provided a new \nfunding stream for the program, and again in 2021, when it appropriated another $1 billion dollars \ntoward it. At every turn Congress has made clear that FEMA needs to engage in more pre-disaster \nmitigation to fulfill its mission, not less, and Congress has barred Defendants from unilaterally \ncountermanding that judgment. See, e.g., 6 U.S.C. §§ 313(b)(1), 316(c)(1). \n225.  The Court should therefore enjoin FEMA’s termination of the BRIC program as a \nviolation of the Separation of Powers. \nVI.  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nAdministrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Contrary to Law, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(C) \n(Termination of BRIC Program – Substantially Reducing Mitigation Functions) \n \n226.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n62 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 63 of 83\n     \n \n227.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might have \ncarried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” Loper Bright \nEnters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 391 (2024) (quotations omitted). The APA thus provides that \ncourts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is contrary to law. 5 U.S. C. § \n706(2)(A)–(C). \n228.  Defendants are agencies under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1). \n229.  Defendants  took  final  agency  action  when  Defendants  terminated  the  BRIC \nprogram and implemented the termination. \n230.  Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program is contrary to law because Congress \nhas not authorized them to terminate the BRIC program or substantially reduce FEMA’s mitigation \nfunctions and capabilities. In fact, Congress has specifically barred it. See 6 U.S.C. §§ 316(c)(1), \n313(b)(1), 313(b)(2)(3), 314(a)(9)(A). Therefore, the BRIC termination violates these statutes and \nthe Separation of Powers.  \n231.  The Court should therefore set aside this unlawful agency action. \nVII.  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Separation of Powers \n(Repurposing BRIC Funds) \n \n232.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n233.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27. \n234.  Executive Branch agencies’ “power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively \nprescribed by Congress.” City of Arlington, 569 U.S. at 297. That means an agency “literally has \nno power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it,” La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. \n63 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 64 of 83\n     \n \nFCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986), and that an agency “may not ignore statutory mandates or \nprohibitions merely because of policy disagreement with Congress,” In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d \n255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n235.  When Congress authorized FEMA to set aside funds from the Disaster Relief Fund \nfor the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund, it intended for those funds to \nbe used for BRIC grants, not for other programs. So Congress took measures to ensure that funds \nthat are set aside for BRIC are used for BRIC.  \n236.  First, Congress provided that once BRIC projects are selected (i.e., once BRIC \nfunds are allocated to a State), FEMA cannot withdraw those funds unless they remain unobligated \n“at the end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal year for which the amounts were allocated.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3). And even then, any withdrawn funds must be returned to the National \nPublic Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and reallocated to new BRIC projects the \nfollowing year. Id. Second, Congress has barred DHS and FEMA from repurposing grant funds in \nits appropriations Acts. In 2024, Congress instructed DHS and FEMA that “no funds shall be \nreprogrammed within or transferred between appropriations to increase or decrease funding for \ngrant programs,” and Congress has carried this restriction forward.58 So FEMA cannot take funds \nset aside for BRIC grants and spend them on other programs. See 6 U.S.C. § 316(d) (confirming \nthat Defendants are required to follow restrictions in appropriations Acts). \n237.  Nevertheless,  Defendants  initiated  a  “Reversal  of  Building  Infrastructure  and \nCommunities Set Aside” and unlawfully diverted $4.071 billion out of the National Public \n \n58 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 503(d)(2), 138 Stat. 460, 615 (2024); \nsee also e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, § 1101, 139 Stat. 9, \n10 (2025) (appropriating funds “under the authority and conditions provided” in “the applicable appropriations Acts \nfor fiscal year 2024”). \n64 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 65 of 83\n     \n \nInfrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund into the Major Declarations component of the Disaster \nRelief Fund, which is used to fund post-disaster grants.  \n238.  This repurposing of BRIC funds for non-BRIC purposes is unlawful and should be \nenjoined.  \nVIII.  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAdministrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Contrary to Law, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(C) \n(Repurposing BRIC Funds) \n \n239.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n240.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might have \ncarried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” Loper Bright, 603 \nU.S. at 391. The APA thus provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is contrary to law. 5 U.S. C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(C). \n241.  Defendants are agencies under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1). \n242.  Defendants took final agency action when Defendants moved funds set aside for \nthe BRIC program out of the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and into \nthe Major Declarations component of the Disaster Relief Fund so that they could be spent on other \nprograms.  \n243.  Defendants’ efforts to repurpose the funds Congress designated for BRIC violates \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3), the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, \n§ 503(d)(2), 138 Stat. 460, 614–15 (2024), Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions \nAct, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, § 1101, 139 Stat. 9, 10 (2025), and the Separation of Powers.  \n244.  The Court should therefore set aside this unlawful agency action. \n65 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 66 of 83\n     \n \nIX.  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Separation of Powers, Appropriations Clause, Spending Clause \n(Withholding Appropriated Funds) \n \n245.

Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27. \n247.  The Constitution’s Spending Clause, art I, § 8, cl. 1, provides that Congress, not the \nExecutive, “shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imports, and Excises, to pay the \nDebts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” \n248.  The Constitution’s Appropriations Clause, art. I, § 9 cl. 7, provides that Congress, \nnot the Executive, has the power to appropriate money from the Treasury. \n249.  “Absent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or \nwithhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals.” City & County \nof  San  Francisco  v.  Trump,  897  F.3d  1225,  1235  (9th  Cir.  2018).  Doing  so  “violates  the \nconstitutional principle of the Separation of Powers.” Id. \n250.  In  the  bipartisan  Infrastructure  Investment  and  Jobs  Act  (“IIJA”),  Congress \nappropriated $1 billion dollars to the BRIC program. See Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, \nPub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, 1387 (2021). In doing so, Congress provided that “200,000,000 \nshall be made available” for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. Id. \n251.  FEMA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for BRIC grants for Fiscal Year \n2024 on January 6, 2025. The application submission deadline was April 18, 2025. \n252.  Plaintiff States then spent significant time and effort preparing applications for \nFiscal Year 2024 BRIC funds. \n66 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 67 of 83\n     \n \n253.  Roughly two weeks before the deadline, FEMA shut down the BRIC program, and \ntwo days before the deadline, FEMA announced that “the Fiscal Year 2024 BRIC funding \nopportunity is cancelled, no applications submitted will be reviewed and no funds will be \nawarded.”59 FEMA also announced that it would “immediately return[]” the IIJA funds to “the \nU.S. Treasury.” Id. \n254.  Defendants are thus refusing to make the funds available for BRIC grants as \nCongress required and are instead withholding the funds.  \n255.  By  doing  so,  Defendants  have  violated  the  Separation  of  Powers,  the \nAppropriations Clause, and the Spending Clause. \n256.  Defendants’ withholding of these funds injures Plaintiff States because it deprives \neach state of the minimum amount of funding to which that state is entitled each fiscal year, 42 \nU.S.C. § 5133(f)(2)(A), and it deprives States of the opportunity to compete for the remaining \nfunding. See W. Va. Ass’n of Cmty. Health Ctrs., Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C. Cir. \n1984) (“[A]ppellants have standing to seek relief that would allow them to compete for additional \nfunding.”). All Plaintiff States have applied for, and received, BRIC grants in the past, and all \nintend to apply in the future. Some Plaintiff States, including Washington, applied for Fiscal Year \n2024 BRIC grants by the deadline notwithstanding Defendants’ unlawful termination of the \nprogram and withholding of Congressionally appropriated funds, while other Plaintiff States chose \nnot to apply in light of FEMA’s unequivocal statement that “no applications submitted will be \n \n59 FEMA Advisory, Update on FEMA Ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities \nProgram (Apr. 16, 2025), https://www.floods.org/wp-content/uploads/FEMA-Advisory-Update-on-FEMA-Ending-\nthe-Building-Resilient-Infrastructure-and-Communities-Program-April-16-2025.pdf. \n \n67 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 68 of 83\n     \n \nreviewed and no funds will be awarded.”60 Regardless, all Plaintiff States stand ready to apply \npromptly should the program be reinstated. \n257.  To  the  extent  FEMA  is  withholding  any  other  Congressionally  appropriated \nfunding for the pre-disaster mitigation program, 42 U.S.C. § 5133, such as funding directed to \nparticular BRIC projects through Congressionally directed spending or funding left over from \nwhen the program was called Pre-Disaster Mitigation, that, too, is unlawful. \n258.  The  Court  should  thus  enjoin  Defendants’  withholding  of  Congressionally \nappropriated funds. \nX.

By  doing  so,  Defendants  have  violated  the  Separation  of  Powers,  the \nAppropriations Clause, the Spending Clause, and any Acts of Congress appropriating funds for \nthis program, including but not limited to the IIJA. \n270.  The Court should therefore set aside this unlawful agency action. \nXI.  SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Appointments Clause \n(Termination of BRIC Program – No Authority to Act as Administrator) \n \n271.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n272.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27. \n273.  The Appointments Clause provides that “Officers of the United States” must be \nnominated by the President “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate” unless the officer \nis an “inferior Officer” and Congress “by Law” vests the appointment of that officer “in the \nPresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” U.S. Const., Art. II, § 2, \ncl. 2. \n274.  The  FEMA  Administrator  is  an  Officer  of  the  United  States  because  the \nAdministrator exercises significant authority on behalf of the United States, and his or her duties \non behalf of the United States are ongoing, and not occasional or temporary. The Administrator is \nresponsible for “lead[ing] the Nation’s efforts to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover \nfrom, and mitigate against the risk of natural disasters.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(2)(A). And in doing so, \nthe Administrator oversees a multi-billion dollar annual budget, and a workforce of thousands.63 \n \n63 Dep’t Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency: FEMA Budget Overview. Fiscal Year \n2026  Congressional  Justification  3,  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-06/25_0613_fema_fy26-\ncongressional-budget-justificatin.pdf (at FEMA-6 and FEMA-7). \n70 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 71 of 83\n     \n \n275.  Congress has not vested the President alone, the Courts of Law, or the Head of a \nDepartment with authority to appoint the FEMA Administrator.  \n276.  In fact, Congress has confirmed that the FEMA “Administrator shall be appointed \nby the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(c)(1). \n277.  Cameron Hamilton, who acted as FEMA Administrator between January 2025 and \nMay 2025, was not nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  \n278.  The FVRA provides the “exclusive means for temporarily authorizing an acting \nofficial to perform the functions and duties of any office of an Executive Agency . . . for which \nappointment is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.” 5 U.S.C. § 3347(a) (emphasis added).  \n279.  Congress provided that when a Presidentially-nominated and Senate-confirmed \nofficer resigns, the “first assistant to the office” automatically becomes the acting officer unless \nthe President directs either another Presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed person to \ntemporarily fill the role or appoints a senior officer or employee of the agency who was in that \nposition for at least “90 days” in “the 365-day period preceding the date of” the resignation. 5 \nU.S.C. § 3345(a). \n280.  Hamilton did not satisfy any of the criteria under the FVRA, such as being the “first \nassistant to the office” or being a senior officer or employee of the agency for at least 90 days \nbefore the position of FEMA Administrator became vacant. See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a). \n281.  Because  Hamilton  was  not  lawfully  appointed  as  FEMA  Administrator  nor \nauthorized to act as Administrator under the FVRA, he was acting without authority when he \nterminated the BRIC program, and his memo directing the termination of the BRIC program and \nhis efforts to implement that termination were void ab initio and should be vacated and set aside. \n71 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 72 of 83\n     \n \nNoel Canning v. N.L.R.B., 705 F.3d 490, 493 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (holding that actions taken by \nunlawfully appointed NLRB board members were “void ab initio” and vacating challenged order), \naff’d 573 U.S. 513 (2014); see also Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 251 (2018). \n282.  David Richardson, who is currently acting as FEMA Administrator, also was not \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate and also does not satisfy the requirements \nof the FVRA, so he, too, is serving unlawfully and thus cannot ratify Hamilton’s termination of \nthe BRIC program and lacks authority to implement that termination. \n283.  The Court should vacate and set aside Hamilton and Richardson’s termination of \nthe BRIC program, and implementation of the termination, and declare these actions void ab initio. \nXII.  EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAdministrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Contrary to Law, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C) \n(Termination of BRIC Program – No Authority to Act as Administrator) \n \n284.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n285.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might have \ncarried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” Loper Bright, 603 \nU.S. at 391. The APA thus provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is contrary to law. 5 U.S. C. § 706(2)(A)–(C). \n286.  Defendants are agencies under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1). \n287.  Defendants  took  final  agency  action  when  Defendants  terminated  the  BRIC \nprogram and implemented the termination. \n288.  For the reasons explained above, Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program \nwas contrary to law because Hamilton and Richardson were not lawfully appointed to serve as \n72 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 73 of 83\n     \n \nFEMA Administrator and thus were without lawful authority to act as FEMA’s Administrator \nwhen they ordered and implemented the BRIC termination. \n289.  The Court should therefore set aside this unlawful agency action. \nXIII.  NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nEquitable Ultra Vires \n(BRIC Termination, Withholding Appropriated Funds, Repurposing BRIC Funds) \n \n290.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n291.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27. \n292.  When agencies “act improperly” or “beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra \nvires.” City of Arlington, 569 U.S. at 297. \n293.  As described above, multiple statutory provisions bar Defendants from unilaterally \nterminating the BRIC program.  See 6 U.S.C. §§ 316(c)(1), 313(b)(1), 313(b)(2)(3), 314(a)(9)(A). \n294.  Therefore, Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program is ultra vires. \n295.  As described above, the IIJA specifically provides that “200,000,000 shall be made \navailable” for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. Pub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. \n429, 1387 (2021).  \n296.  Therefore, Defendants’ refusal to spend these funds Congress appropriated for the \nBRIC program, and specifically ordered Defendants to make available, is ultra vires. \n297.  As described above, multiple statutory provisions specifically bar Defendants from \nredirecting funds set aside for BRIC to non-BRIC programs. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3); Further \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 503(d)(2), 138 Stat. 460, 615 \n73 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 74 of 83\n     \n \n(2024); see also, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. \n119-4, § 1101, 139 Stat. 9, 10 (2025). \n298.  Therefore, Defendants’ redirecting of funds set aside for the BRIC program for \nother purposes is ultra vires. \n299.  As described above, the FVRA specifically bars Defendants from “temporarily \nauthorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of any office of an Executive \nAgency . . . for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice \nand consent of the Senate,” 5 U.S.C. § 3347(a), unless the appointment is in accordance with 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 3345, 3346.  \n300.  As  described  above,  neither  Cameron  Hamilton  nor  David  Richardson  were \nappointed to act as FEMA Administrator in compliance with 5 U.S.C. § 3345, and thus their \nappointments and their termination of the BRIC program and implementation of that termination \nwere ultra vires. \nXIV.  TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nAdministrative Procedure Act,  \nUnlawful Withholding and/or Unreasonable Delay of Agency Action, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n(Withholding Appropriated Funds) \n \n301.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n302.  The APA authorizes a court to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  Relief is warranted under this provision where an \nagency completely fails to take, or unreasonably delays in taking, “a discrete agency action that it \nis required to take.”  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004) (emphasis \nomitted); see id. at 63 n.1. \n74 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 75 of 83\n     \n \n303.  By statute, Defendants have a duty to keep unobligated BRIC funds available to \nStates for at least three fiscal years following the fiscal year for which the funds were allocated.  \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(A).  Once BRIC funds have been allocated to any State, the Defendants \nhave a duty to retain those funds solely for BRIC purposes.  42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(B).  Because \nstatutes mandate BRIC funds be made available, the act of making them available is ministerial.  \nPlaintiff  States  have  been  allocated  BRIC  funds.    In  terminating  the  BRIC  program  and \nrepurposing the BRIC funds, Defendants violated their duty to Plaintiff States to keep those funds \navailable. \n304.   The IIJA provides that “in addition to amounts set aside pursuant to . . . 42 U.S.C. \n§ 5133 . . . $200,000,000 . . . shall be made available” for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, \n2025, and 2026. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, 1387 \n(2021).  By terminating the BRIC program, cancelling the 2024 NOFO, and not issuing a 2025 \nNOFO, Defendants have refused to make these funds available or at least have unreasonably \ndelayed making them available in violation. \n305.  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  an  order  and  permanent \ninjunction compelling defendants to reopen the fiscal year 2024 Notice of Funding Opportunity, \nevaluate applications, and select recipients in a reasonable time period, and also open a 2025 \nNotice of Funding Opportunity, evaluate applications, and select recipients in a reasonable time \nperiod, actions which defendants have unlawfully withheld and/or unreasonably delayed.    \n \n75 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006-RGS     Document 85     Filed 08/29/25     Page 76 of 83\n     \n \nXV.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court: \na.

Vacate and set aside Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program, withholding of \nCongressionally appropriated funds, and redirecting funds set aside for the BRIC program to other \nagency initiatives.  \ne.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  Defendants’  termination  of  the  BRIC \nprogram, and any action to implement that termination, and restore the status quo as it existed \nbefore the termination, including by requiring Defendants to reopen the fiscal year 2024 Notice of \nFunding Opportunity, evaluate applications, and select recipients in a reasonable time period. \nf.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  For nearly thirty years, and across five Presidential administrations, FEMA’s pre-\ndisaster mitigation program has operated on a simple premise: by proactively fortifying our \ncommunities against disasters before they strike, rather than just responding afterward, we will \nreduce injuries, save lives, protect property, and, ultimately, save money that would otherwise be \nspent on post-disaster costs. \n2.  Studies have shown that that each dollar spent on mitigation saves an average of $6 \nin post-disaster costs, with some investments saving even more. Thus, Congress has consistently \nfunded  an  all-purpose  pre-disaster  mitigation  program—now  called  Building  Resilient \nInfrastructure and Communities, or BRIC—for decades, and explicitly directed FEMA to make \nmitigation a core part of its mission. \n3.  Over the past four years, FEMA has selected nearly 2,000 projects to receive \nroughly $4.5 billion in BRIC funding. From Washington to North Carolina and Arizona to Maine, \nand everywhere in between, every state in the nation is relying on this program. \n4.  All  that  changed  when  Cameron  Hamilton,  who  the  Trump  Administration \nunlawfully installed to act as FEMA’s Administrator, suddenly—and illegally—shut down the \nprogram. Mr. Hamilton’s purported termination of the BRIC program was unlawful for three \nreasons. \n5.  First, the BRIC termination is directly contrary to Congress’s statutory direction \nthat Defendants must prioritize mitigation and are specifically barred from substantially reducing \nFEMA’s  mitigation  functions.  By  unilaterally  shutting  down  FEMA’s  flagship  pre-disaster \nmitigation program, Defendants have acted unlawfully and violated core separation of powers \nprinciples. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 3 of 68\n6.  Second, the steps Defendants have taken to implement the termination—refusing \nto spend funds Congress directed toward BRIC or trying to spend them on other programs—also \nviolate the Constitution and unlawfully intrude on Congress’s power of the purse. \n7.  Third, neither Mr. Hamilton nor his successor, David Richardson, were lawfully \nappointed to run FEMA, and they therefore lack the authority to shut down the BRIC program. \n8.  The impact of the shutdown has been devastating. Communities across the country \nare being forced to delay, scale back, or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects depending on this \nfunding. Projects that have been in development for years, and in which communities have \ninvested  millions  of  dollars  for  planning,  permitting,  and  environmental  review  are  now \nthreatened. And in the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from \nnatural disasters. \n9.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to compel FEMA to reverse the unlawful termination \nof the BRIC program so that communities across the country can resume this critical work. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n11.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2), 1391(e)(1) because defendants are \nagencies of the United States and officers of the United States acting in their official capacities; a \nsubstantial part of the events and omission giving rise to the claims occurred in this district; and \nplaintiff Commonwealth of Massachusetts resides in this district. \nIII.

FEMA’s Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program Has Helped the Nation Protect Against \nDisasters for Nearly 30 Years \n37.  Following a series of devastating hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes in the 1980s \nand 1990s, Congress and FEMA recognized that fortifying against natural disasters before they \nstrike, rather than just reacting to them, can save lives, protect property, and save the federal \ngovernment “significant sums” that it would otherwise spend on “post-disaster clean-up and \nresponse.” H.R. Rep. No. 104-812, at 78–79 (1996) (Conf. Rep.). \n38.  Congress thus decided that FEMA “should be taking an increasingly active role in \ndeveloping  and  participating  in  pre-disaster  mitigation  programs,”  and  in  1997  started \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 8 of 68\nappropriating funds for FEMA to develop a program to assist state and local governments in \nprotecting against natural disasters. Id. \n39.  With these appropriations, FEMA started a pilot program called Project Impact in \n1997, which focused mainly on helping communities to evaluate the hazards they faced and \ndevelop mitigation plans. \n40.  After  a  promising  start,  a  bipartisan  group  of  representatives  co-sponsored \nlegislation that would codify the program in statute and expand its focus to helping communities \nacross the country implement these mitigation measures. The Committee Report explained that \n“the only way to control post-disaster spending for response, relief, and recovery is to increase \npre-disaster funding for mitigation, planning, and preparedness,” and cited testimony from FEMA \nsuggesting “that mitigation measures return $3 for every $1 spent.” H.R. Rep. No. 106-40, at 11, \n21 (1999). \n41.  The bill, which ultimately came to be known as the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, \npassed the House of Representatives by a vote of 415 to 2, and passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent. President Clinton signed the bill into law a few months later, and communities large and \nsmall have relied on the program ever since. \n42.  The concept is simple: FEMA provides financial and technical assistance to support \nstate, local, tribal, and territorial governments in implementing “cost-effective” measures that are \n“designed to reduce injuries, loss of life, and damage and destruction of property” from natural \ndisasters. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(b). Recipients may also use these funds to assess hazards they face and \ndevelop plans for mitigating them. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(e). Each grant can cover up to 75% of a \nproject’s  costs,  and  the  federal  share  can  rise  to  90%  for  small  rural  communities.  \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(h).  \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 9 of 68\n43.   Congress has since required FEMA to award a portion of the funds competitively \nbased on criteria established by Congress, including the extent to which a proposed project will \nmitigate damage from natural disasters, its cost-effectiveness, the applicant’s commitment to \nspending its own funds on disaster mitigation, and the extent to which the project maximizes “net \nbenefits to society” beyond FEMA savings. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 5133(f), (g). \n44.  To ensure that the benefits would be widespread, Congress provided that any state \nthat “received a major disaster declaration in the previous 7 years” is eligible for grants, required \nFEMA to grant a minimum amount of funding to communities in every eligible state each year, \nand placed an annual cap on the amount any one state can receive. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(2). \n45.  Congress also took measures to ensure that small rural communities would be \nincluded: it specified that one mandatory consideration in awarding the grants is the extent to \nwhich a project benefits a “small impoverished community,” which is “a community of 3,000 or \nfewer  individuals  that  is  economically  disadvantaged.”  42  U.S.C.  §  5133(a).  Only  rural \ncommunities can qualify for this preference—small portions of larger cities cannot. 44 C.F.R. § \n201.2. Congress recognized that small rural communities often do not have sufficient resources to \ncontribute to significant mitigation projects, so it allowed FEMA to cover up to 90% of project \ncosts rather than the 75% limit applicable to other applicants. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 5133(a), (f)(2), \n(g)(9). \n46.  The program has gone by different names over the years—Project Impact, Pre-\nDisaster Mitigation (PDM), and Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC)—but \nregardless of the name, it has been wildly successful. These critical funds have supported hundreds \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 10 of 68\nof projects in every corner of the country, and, along with other federal mitigation grants, they \nhave also helped to avoid over $150 billion in costs.1 \n47.  For instance, before the Trump Administration shut it down, BRIC was poised to \nfund hundreds of critical, lifesaving projects, including: (1) floodwalls, levees, pump stations, and \nstormwater management systems to protect against flooding, (2) seismic retrofits to fortify against \nearthquakes, (3) saferooms to provide shelter from tornados, (4) an evacuation tower to allow for \nescape  from  tsunamis,  (5)  soil  remediation  to  protect  against  landslides,  (6)  vegetation \nmanagement to reduce damage from wildfires, and (7) shoreline upgrades to protect against \nerosion and flooding. Many of these projects were intended to protect critical infrastructure, \nensuring that electricity, heat, clean water, and medical care remain available in emergencies. \n48.  Not only is the program widely relied upon, it has proven to be cost-effective too. \nA 2005 study commissioned by FEMA found that each dollar FEMA spends on mitigation saves \nthe federal government about “$3.65 in avoided post-disaster relief costs and increased federal tax \nrevenue.”2 Another study by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that each dollar spent on \nthe program would avoid roughly three dollars in future losses.3 And a 2019 study found that each \ndollar the federal government invested in mitigation between 1993 and 2016 will avoid roughly \n$6 in costs.4 To put that in absolute terms, two decades of federal investments in mitigation have \nsaved Americans $157.9 billion.5 And some mitigation efforts can save even more. \n \n1 See Nat’l Inst. of Bldg.

Communities in every state have benefited from federally funded mitigation grants, \nwith most states saving at least $1 billion in post-disaster costs, and four states—Louisiana, New \nJersey, New York, and Texas—each avoiding at least $10 billion in post-disaster costs.6  \n50.  While cost savings are one major benefit of the program, these dollars represent \nmore than money. They represent lives saved, homes spared, businesses surviving, and public \nservices—like hospitals, schools, and fire departments—remaining open when people need them \nmost.  \nB.  Congress Expanded the Program During President Trump’s First Term and FEMA \nRebranded it as BRIC \n51.  Given the success of the program, Congress has continued to invest in it. In 2018, \nin the wake of Hurricane Harvey causing more than $100 billion of damage to Texas, Hurricane \nMaria killing thousands in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Irma devastating Florida, and wildfires ravaging \nCalifornia, Congress held hearings to assess what more it could do.  \n52.  President Trump’s first FEMA Administrator, Brock Long, explained in written \ntestimony that “Building more resilient communities is the best way to reduce risks to people, \nproperty, and taxpayer dollars. I cannot overstate the importance of focusing on investing in \nmitigation before a disaster strikes.”7 And he emphasized the point in oral testimony, too: \n“We have to do more pre-disaster mitigation. Pre-disaster mitigation is the key to becoming more \nresilient and reducing disaster impacts.”8 \n53.  A  few  months  later,  FEMA  released  its  2018–2022  Strategic  Plan.  FEMA’s \n“Strategic  Goal  1”  was  “Build  a  Culture  of  Preparedness,”  and  its  first  objective  was  to \n \n6 See id., 119. \n7 2017 Hurricane Season: Oversight of the Federal Response: Hearing Before the S. Comm. On Homeland \nSec. & Gov’t Affairs, 115th Cong. 58 (2017) (statement of William “Brock” Long, Administrator, FEMA). \n8Id., 9 \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 12 of 68\n“Incentivize  Investments  that  Reduce  Risk,  Including  Pre-Disaster  Mitigation,  and  Reduce \nDisaster Costs at All Levels.” FEMA explained: \nBuying down the risk prior to a disaster pays off – either by lowering the cost of \nthe disaster or eliminating the need for a presidentially-declared disaster altogether \nbecause  of  the  lessened  impact.  FEMA  plays a  critical  role  in  enabling  and \nincentivizing investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation. \nAnd FEMA pledged to “work with Congress to develop flexible and holistic approaches for more \nFederal funds to be spent on risk reduction and pre-disaster mitigation.”9 \n54.  When Administrator Long returned to Congress a few months later, he reiterated \nthat “developing resilient communities ahead of an incident reduces loss of life and economic \ndisruption,” and stated bluntly: “It is a no-brainer: More investment in pre-disaster mitigation \nrather than doing it after the fact is ultimately going to reduce disaster costs.”10 \n55.  Following these hearings, Senators Ron Johnson (R-WI), Claire McCaskill (D-\nMO), and John Kennedy (R-LA) co-sponsored the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 \n(DRRA) to increase the consistency of funding for the pre-disaster mitigation program. For most \nof its history, the program was funded exclusively through ordinary appropriations, which could \nbe unpredictable and made planning for and executing long-term infrastructure projects difficult. \nThis bill would allow FEMA to also set aside certain funds from the Disaster Relief Fund, which \nfunds FEMA’s post-disaster grants, into a dedicated National Public Infrastructure Predisaster \nMitigation Fund. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(i)(1). By setting aside a fraction of these post-disaster funds \nfor pre-disaster mitigation, FEMA could establish “a greater balance . . . between pre- and post-\ndisaster resilience investments,” which would “save lives and Federal tax dollars.” S. Rep. No. \n115-446, at 3 (2018). \n \n9  Fed.  Em.  Mgmt.

At the same time, Congress indicated that it would appropriate more funds for the \nDisaster Relief Fund so that there would be no reduction in the amount available for post-disaster \ngrants. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(i)(3). \n57.  The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 398–23 and passed the \nSenate by a vote of 93–6. President Trump signed it into law a few days later. \n58.  FEMA announced that this new “reliable stream of sufficient funding” would allow \ncommunities “to plan and execute mitigation programs to reduce disaster risk nationwide.”11 And \nin a subsequent report FEMA reiterated that Congress’s expansion of the pre-disaster mitigation \nprogram under the DRRA “supports FEMA’s efforts to incentivize pre-disaster mitigation by \nproviding a more reliable stream of funding that enables communities to better plan and execute \nmitigation programs that reduce their disaster risk.”12 \n59.  After the bill passed, FEMA rebranded what was then called the “Pre-Disaster \nMitigation (PDM)” program as the “Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC)” \nprogram. FEMA publicized the change well before it went into effect and ensured that existing \nprojects under the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program would be unaffected. Congress also authorized \nFEMA to transfer funds previously appropriated for the program, when it was still called the Pre-\nDisaster Mitigation program, into the new National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation \nFund.13 \n60.  In addition to appropriating funds for FEMA to set aside for BRIC, Congress also \nappropriated another $1 billion directly to the program as part of the bipartisan Infrastructure \n \n11 Press Release, Fed.

L. No. 118-47 § 310, 138 Stat. 460, 611 \n(2024) (allowing transfer of PDM funds to BRIC fund). \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 14 of 68\nInvestment and Jobs Act (IIJA). See Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58, \n135 Stat. 429, 1387 (2021). In doing so, Congress required FEMA to make at least $200 million \navailable for grants for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026, in addition to the \namounts FEMA set aside for the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund. See \nid.  (providing  that  “in  addition  to  amounts  set  aside  pursuant  to . . . 42  U.S.C.  § \n5133 . . . $200,000,000 . . . shall be made available” for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, \n2025, and 2026) (emphasis added). \n61.  And since then, Congress has continued to appropriate additional funds for specific \nBRIC projects through Congressionally directed spending.14 \nC.  The Modern BRIC Program \n62.  Following Congress’s passage of the DRRA, the BRIC program works as follows. \n63.  FEMA estimates the total cost of certain post-disaster grants and then uses that \nnumber to determine how much money it can set aside for BRIC and move into the National Public \nInfrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(i)(1). To ensure that the BRIC \nset aside does “not reduce the amounts otherwise made available for” the post-disaster grants, \nFEMA incorporates additional funds for BRIC into its budget requests to Congress. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 5133(i)(3).15 \n \n14 See, e.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47 cl. 12(B), 138 Stat. 460, 608 \n(2024) (appropriating approximately $191 million “for pre-disaster mitigation grants under . . . 42 U.S.C. § 5133(e)”). \n15 See also William L.

After FEMA receives funding from Congress, it sets aside the funds for the BRIC \nprogram and moves them into the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund. See \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(i)(1). Once the funds are set aside, they must remain in the National Public \nInfrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund. 42 U.S.C. 5133(f)(3) (providing that any funds lawfully \nwithdrawn  from  selected  projects  must  be  used  for  BRIC  grants  the  next  year);  Further \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 503(d)(2), 138 Stat. 460, 615 (2024) \n(providing that Defendants cannot reprogram or transfer funds “to increase or decrease funding \nfor grant programs”). \n65.  FEMA then issues a notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) setting out the amount \nof funding available for that year, the criteria the agency will apply in selecting projects, and the \napplication instructions.16 One mandatory criterion is that every project selected must be “cost-\neffective,” meaning that it will save more money than it costs. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(e)(1)(A).  \n66.  Applying for a BRIC grant is a significant undertaking. In addition to demonstrating \ncost-effectiveness, States and their subapplicants often must undertake months or years of costly \nplanning and design, feasibility studies and modeling, environmental review, and stakeholder \nengagement to prepare their applications. FEMA then reviews the applications and selects the most \npromising projects while ensuring that each state that applies is allocated a minimum amount of \nfunding required by the law, and that no one state receives too much funding. See 42 U.S.C. § \n5133(f)(2). Once projects are selected, applicants often go through additional rounds of planning, \npermitting, environmental review, and stakeholder engagement before a final grant agreement is \nsigned and all the funds are fully obligated.  \n \n16 See, e.g., Dep’t of Homeland Security, Notice of Funding Opportunity for Fiscal Year 2023: Building \nResilient Infrastructure and Communities Program (Oct. 12, 2022), https://www.floridadisaster.org/globalassets/fy-\n2023-bric-notice-of-funding-opportunity-nofo.pdf. \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 16 of 68\n67.  To ensure that the federal BRIC funds are available for states at the end of this \nlengthy process, Congress has provided that once projects are selected—i.e., once BRIC funds are \nallocated to states—Defendants cannot withdraw them unless the funds “remain unobligated by \nthe end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal year for which the amounts were allocated.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(A). And even if the funds are withdrawn at that time, they must be returned \nto the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and made “available to be \nawarded on a competitive basis” during the next fiscal year. See 42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(B). \n68.  Once a project receives final approval, the funds are formally obligated, and \nconstruction may begin. \nD.  Every State Is Relying on the BRIC Program. \n69.  The BRIC program is critically important nationwide. Over the past four years, \nFEMA has selected nearly 2,000 projects from every corner of the country to receive roughly $4.5 \nbillion in funding.  \n70.  Due to the unique threats they face, coastal communities have received the largest \nallocations over the past four years, with California, Louisiana, Texas, New York, New Jersey, \nFlorida, North Carolina, and Washington leading the way.  \n71.  But interior communities rely on BRIC too: Pennsylvania and Utah have received \nthe next largest allocations, and Ohio is not far behind. And before the administration unlawfully \nterminated BRIC, FEMA was poised to fund upgrades to electrical infrastructure in Iowa (~$11 \nmillion), Nebraska (~$25 million), and Kentucky (~$6.4 million) so that residents can maintain \npower and heat during storms; flood mitigation in Ohio (~$24 million), Montana (~$7 million), \nIdaho (~$7 million), West Virginia (~$7 million), and Indiana (~$6.2 million), to reduce injuries \nand property damage; pump stations in Pennsylvania (~$100 million) to protect infrastructure \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 17 of 68\nduring severe storms; and a pump station in North Dakota (~$7.1 million) to provide a small \ncommunity with a reliable water source, even during low river flows.  \n72.  In fact, BRIC has been so popular that it has been oversubscribed each application \ncycle, even as FEMA has increased the amount of funding available. Over the last four years there \nwere hundreds more applications than could be selected, seeking billions more dollars than was \navailable: \n \nFiscal Year  Funds Available17  Funds Applied For18 \n2020  $500 Million  $3.1 Billion \n2021  $1 Billion  $3.5 Billion \n2022  $2.295 Billion  $3.6 Billion \n2023  $1 Billion  $5.4 Billion \n2024  $750 Million  BRIC Cancelled \n \nFiscal Year  Projects Selected19  Applications20 \n2020  408  987 \n2021  371  789 \n2022  518  801 \n2023  720  1,235 \n \n17 This figure is based on the Notice of Funding Opportunity for each fiscal year. \n18 This figure is the sum of the “federalShareAmount” column for all applications, as determined by the \nmethodology in footnote 20. \n19 This figure is based on OpenFEMA data last updated on June 24, 2025 and downloaded from FEMA.gov \non July 10, 2025.

Before  President  Trump  entered  office  for  the  second  time,  former  officials \nassociated with President Trump developed a series of policy proposals in a Heritage Foundation \nreport called “Project 2025.” The section on FEMA asserts, without evidence, and contrary to \nFEMA’s position during the first Trump administration, that FEMA grants “do not provide \nmeasurable  gains  for  preparedness  or  resiliency,”  and  argues  that  these  grants  “should  be \nterminated.”21 It cautions, however, that doing so “will require action by Members of Congress \nwho repeatedly vote to fund grants.”22 \n75.  On January 24, 2025, just four days after being sworn into office, President Trump \ntold reporters, “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away.”23  \n76.  That same day, he issued an Executive Order creating a Council to Assess the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, which is supposed to perform “a full-scale review” of \nFEMA and “recommend to the President improvements or structural changes” to the agency. Exec. \nOrder No. 14180, 90 Fed. Reg. 8743 (Jan. 24, 2025). \n77.  Then, in a televised cabinet meeting on March 24, 2025, Department of Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Kristi Noem said, “we’re going to eliminate FEMA.”  \n78.  The next day, Secretary Noem, Corey Lewandowksi, and Cameron Hamilton, who \nwas leading FEMA at the time, met and “debated the possibility of rescinding President Donald \n \n21 See Ken Cuccinelli, Department of Homeland Security at 154, in Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership: \nThe  Conservative  Promise  (The  Heritage  Foundation,  2023),  https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2024/05/Project-2025-Mandate-for-Leadership-The-Conservative-Promise.pdf. \n22 Id. \n23 Zack Colman, Trump’s talking about shutting down FEMA.

But eliminating FEMA is illegal. In addition to fundamental separation of powers \nprinciples  barring  Defendants  from  unilaterally  shuttering  congressionally  created  agencies, \nCongress took a belt-and-suspenders approach with FEMA and passed a statute in 2006 entitled \n“Preserving  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,”  which  requires  FEMA  to  “be \nmaintained as a distinct entity” within DHS. 6 U.S.C. § 316(a). \n80.  As an alternative to eliminating FEMA, Defendants also discussed “narrowing and \nfocusing  the  aperture  of  FEMA’s  mission  dramatically”  by  “narrowing  the  agency’s \nresponsibilities to helping survivors in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”25 As part of that \neffort, Secretary Noem said “that she wants to eliminate FEMA’s role in funding long-term \nrebuilding efforts and halt multibillion-dollar grants programs that help communities prepare for \ndisasters.”26 When reached for comment, a DHS spokesperson essentially confirmed the reporting: \n“We are grateful the press is covering Secretary Noem’s efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and \nabuse within the Department of Homeland Security.”27 \n81.  But narrowing FEMA’s mission and functions to only post-disaster response is \nillegal too: the same statute that bars Defendants from eliminating FEMA also prohibits them from \n“substantially or significantly reduc[ing] . . . the authorities, responsibilities, or functions of the \nAgency or the capability of the Agency to perform those missions, authorities, responsibilities, \n \n24 Gabe Cohen, ‘We’re not preparing’: As Trump officials vow to eliminate FEMA, the agency is already in \nturmoil,  CNN,  March  26,  2025,  https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/politics/fema-payments-staffing-stalled-\nturmoil/index.html. \n25  Thomas  Frank,  FEMA  on  the  chopping  block,  E&E  News  by  Politico,  March  26,  2025, \nhttps://www.eenews.net/articles/fema-on-the-chopping-block/. \n26Id. \n27 Id. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 20 of 68\nexcept as otherwise specifically provided in an Act enacted after October 4, 2006.” 6 U.S.C. § \n316(c)(1).  \n82.  This  provision  was  added  in  the  wake  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  after  Congress \ndetermined that one of the key reasons FEMA was unprepared was that DHS leadership had \nrejected the concept of “integrated emergency management,” which posits that the most effective \nway to reduce damage from disasters is for a single agency to engage in four interrelated functions: \nmitigation,  preparation,  response,  and  recovery.28  Instead  of  following  this  approach,  DHS \nleadership had stripped FEMA of its preparedness responsibilities and assigned them to others \nwithin DHS.29 Congress concluded that this “was a mistake” and that “preparedness, response, \nrecovery, and mitigation require synergy” so FEMA must engage in all four functions.30 \n83.  As a result, Congress provided by law that each of these four functions, including \nmitigation, is a core component of FEMA’s mission: “The primary mission of” FEMA “is to \nreduce the loss of life and property and protect the Nation from all hazards” through “a risk-based, \ncomprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, \nand mitigation.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(1) (emphasis added); see also 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(2)(D) \n(providing that the Administrator “shall . . . integrate the Agency’s emergency preparedness, \nprotection,  response,  recovery,  and  mitigation  responsibilities”);  6  U.S.C.  §  314(a)(9)(A) \n(providing that the FEMA “Administrator shall provide federal leadership necessary to . . . mitigate \nagainst a natural disaster,” including by maintaining “a risk-based, comprehensive emergency \nmanagement system” that includes “mitigation” and by “taking sustained actions to reduce or \neliminate long-term risks to people and property from hazards and their effects”). \n \n28 S.

And Congress also provided that Defendants may not alter that mission, nor can \nthey materially reduce FEMA’s ability to carry out any of these functions, unless “otherwise \nspecifically provided” by Congress “in an Act enacted after October 4, 2006.” 6 U.S.C. § \n316(c)(1). \n85.  Congress  has  not  enacted  any  statute  “after  October  4,  2006”  “specifically” \nauthorizing Defendants to terminate FEMA’s pre-disaster mitigation grant program or reduce \nFEMA’s mitigation functions and capabilities. \n86.  Nevertheless,  a  few  days  after  the  March  25  Noem–Lewandowski–Hamilton \nmeeting, Mr. Hamilton, then the so-called “Senior Official Performing the Duties of FEMA \nAdministrator,” sent a memo (“the Hamilton Memo”) directing the termination of the BRIC \nprogram and setting out rules for the agency to apply in carrying out the termination.31 The memo \nasserted, without evidence, that “Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grants \nhave not increased the level of hazard mitigation as much as desired, and may supplant state, local, \ntribal and territorial capital investment planning.”32  \n87.  Two days later, FEMA issued a press release entitled “FEMA Ends Wasteful, \nPoliticized Grant Program, Returning Agency to Core Mission of Helping Americans Recovering \nfrom Natural Disasters,” in which it announced that “FEMA is ending the Building Resilient \nInfrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program.”33  \n \n31  Memorandum  from  Cameron  Hamilton  to  Christopher  Logan,  Future  of  the  Building  Resilient \nInfrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program (April 2, 2025), available at https://www.oregon.gov/oem/Memos \n%20and%20Executive%20Orders/250404_SOPDO_Administrator_Memo_on_BRIC.pdf. \n \n32 Id. \n33 Press Release, Fed.

Defendants acknowledged that Congress had appropriated $1 billion toward the \nBRIC program through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act but announced that \nFEMA would not spend those funds as Congress had instructed. Id. Instead, Defendants stated that \nthey would be withholding the funds and returning roughly $882 million dollars to the U.S. \nTreasury. Id. The press release also said that Defendants would move BRIC funds out of the \nNational Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and back into the Disaster Relief Fund. \nId.  \n89.  About two weeks after that, FEMA issued an “Update on FEMA Ending the \nBuilding Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program” that provided more detail about how \nFEMA is implementing the Hamilton Memo.34 Specifically, FEMA announced: \na.  “[T]he  Fiscal  Year  2024  BRIC  funding  opportunity  is  cancelled,  no \napplications submitted will be reviewed and no funds will be awarded.” \n \nb.  “Fully obligated projects that have not started construction will not be \napproved and will end.” \n \nc.  “FEMA will not be extending project deadlines without the Senior Official \nPerforming the Duties of the FEMA Administrator’s approval.” \n \nd.  “For previous funding cycles, FEMA will cancel all of the BRIC projects \nselected but not obligated across fiscal years 2020-2023.” \n \ne.  “Management  costs  will  only  continue  for  partially  or  fully  obligated \nprojects.” \n \n90.  Consistent with the Hamilton Memo, FEMA revealed in June that at some point in \nApril, FEMA initiated a “Reversal of Building Infrastructure and Communities Set Aside” and \nunlawfully diverted $4.071 billion out of the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation \n \n34 FEMA Advisory, Update on FEMA Ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program \n(Apr.  16,  2025),  available  at  https://www.floods.org/wp-content/uploads/FEMA-Advisory-Update-on-FEMA-\nEnding-the-Building-Resilient-Infrastructure-and-Communities-Program-April-16-2025.pdf. \n \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 23 of 68\nFund into the Major Declarations component of the Disaster Relief Fund, which funds FEMA’s \npost-disaster grants.35  \n91.  FEMA projects that it will start spending the BRIC funds on these other post-\ndisaster programs in just a few weeks.36 \nF.  Cameron Hamilton Was Not Lawfully Acting as the FEMA Administrator When He \nTerminated BRIC \n92.  At the time Mr. Hamilton purported to shut down the BRIC program, he was not \nlawfully acting as the FEMA Administrator. \n93.  The  Constitution’s  Appointments  Clause  provides  the  “exclusive  means”  of \nappointing Officers of the United States. Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 244 (2018). That Clause \nprovides that principal “Officers of the United States” may be appointed only if they are nominated \nby the President “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.” U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2. \nThis “is also the default manner of appointment for inferior officers,” which applies unless \nCongress authorizes the President, “Courts of Law,” or the head of a department to appoint the \ninferior officer. Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 660 (1997); U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2. \n94.  The  FEMA  Administrator  is  an  Officer  of  the  United  States  because  the \nAdministrator’s duties on behalf of the United States are ongoing, and not occasional or temporary, \nand the FEMA Administrator exercises significant authority on behalf of the United States. By \nstatute, the Administrator “shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent \nof the Senate.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(c)(1). \n \n35  See  Fed.  Em.  Mgmt.

In addition, Congress has set minimum qualifications for who may serve as FEMA \nAdministrator. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs made recommendations for how FEMA could be reformed so that it \nwould perform better when the next disaster struck. One of the Committee’s key findings was that \nFEMA did not perform as Congress expected during Katrina in part because of “unqualified senior \npolitical leadership.”37 Among other problems, “FEMA’s senior political appointees, including \nDirector Michael Brown and Deputy Director Patrick Rhode, had little or no prior relevant \nemergency-management experience before joining FEMA.”38  \n96.  As a result, Congress changed the law to require FEMA’s Administrator to have “a \ndemonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management and homeland security” and \n“not less than 5 years of executive leadership and management experience in the public or private \nsector.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(c)(2). \n97.  Mr. Hamilton was never nominated to serve as FEMA Administrator, nor was he \nconfirmed by the Senate. Moreover, he “lacks the emergency management experience required \nunder federal law.”39 See 6 U.S.C. § 313(c)(2). \n98.  Nonetheless, the administration tried to work around the required process: On \nJanuary 20, 2025, Deanne Criswell, the FEMA Administrator under President Biden, resigned. \nRather than nominating Mr. Hamilton as FEMA Administrator and seeking Senate confirmation, \nthe administration appointed him to serve as the Associate Administrator of FEMA’s Office of \n \n37 S. Rep. No. 109-322, at 225 (2006); see also id. at 214–15. \n38 Id., at 593. \n39  Thomas  Frank,  Fired  FEMA  chief  threatened  to  quit  weeks  ago,  Politico,  May  8,  2025, \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/fema-chief-fired-cameron-hamilton-00335840. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 25 of 68\nResponse and Recovery on January 20, 2025, and then, within two days, elevated him to act as the \nAdministrator under the title “Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator.”40 \n99.  That approach is not authorized by Congress or the Constitution. Through the \nFederal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), Congress has provided the “exclusive means for \ntemporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of any office of an \nExecutive Agency . . . for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.” 5 U.S.C. § 3347(a) (emphasis added). \n100.  Congress provided that when a Presidentially-nominated and Senate-confirmed \nofficer resigns, the “first assistant to the office” automatically becomes the acting officer unless \nthe President directs either another Presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed person to \ntemporarily fill the role or appoints a senior officer or employee of the agency who was in that \nposition for at least “90 days” in “the 365-day period preceding the date of” the resignation.  \n5 U.S.C. § 3345(a). \n101.  Mr. Hamilton did not satisfy any of these criteria: he was not the first assistant to \nthe FEMA Administrator on January 20, 2025, he had not been nominated by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate to any office, and he was not a senior officer or employee at FEMA or \nDHS for at least 90 days in the year preceding the vacancy. Instead, during the year prior to the \nvacancy,  Mr.  Hamilton  was  the  Director  of  Business  Strategy  at  a  consulting  firm  called \nProSoDel LLC and a candidate for Congress. Mr. Hamilton thus could not lawfully act as the \nFEMA Administrator, and his termination of the BRIC program was unlawful. \n \n40 Christopher Flavelle, Former Navy SEAL Said to Be Interim Head of FEMA, The New York Times, Jan. \n22, 2025, https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/fema-announcement-cameron-hamilton.html. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 26 of 68\nG.  The Trump Administration Replaced Hamilton with Another Illegal Administrator \n102.  On May 7, 2025, Mr. Hamilton testified before Congress that “I do not believe that \nit is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency.” He was fired the next day.  \n103.  FEMA then announced that David Richardson, who was appointed in January 2025 \nto serve as DHS’s Assistant Secretary for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, \nwould act as Administrator. Mr. Richardson has never been confirmed by the Senate to any \nposition, nor does he meet the criteria set out by the FVRA: he was not the first assistant to the \nFEMA Administrator on January 20, 2025, he had not been nominated by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate to any office at that time, and he was not a senior officer or employee at \nFEMA or DHS for at least 90 days in the 365 days preceding the vacancy. \n104.  Like Hamilton, Richardson “has no prior emergency management experience,” so \nhe also does not meet the statutory qualifications for the FEMA Administrator.41 \n105.  In his first meeting with FEMA staff, Mr. Richardson declared: “I can’t recall the \nfull title, but essentially, I’m acting. I don’t need the full title. All I need is the authority from the \npresident to put me in here as some degree of acting and I will make sure his intent gets \ncompleted.”42  \n106.  Richardson is incorrect. The President’s say-so does not override the Constitution. \nTo lawfully act as FEMA Administrator, Richardson must either be confirmed by the Senate or \nsatisfy the requirements of the FVRA. Because Mr. Richardson has not been nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate and does not satisfy the requirements of the FVRA, he is \n \n41 Rebecca Hersher, The Trump administration says it wants to eliminate FEMA.

To date, after nearly six months in office, President Trump has failed to nominate \na FEMA Administrator for Senate confirmation. \nH.  The Steps Defendants Have Taken to Implement the Hamilton Memo—Including \nRefusing to Spend Congressionally Appropriated Funds on BRIC and Preparing to \nSpend Those Funds on Other Programs—Are Independently Unlawful \n1.  Refusing to spend funds Congress appropriated for BRIC is unlawful. \n108.  Our Constitution “exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \nPresident.” City & County. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018). That \nmeans when Congress appropriates funds for Defendants to make available, Defendants must do \nso. \n109.  “[T]he President is without authority to thwart congressional will by canceling \nappropriations passed by Congress.” Id. And “the President and federal agencies may not ignore \nstatutory mandates or prohibitions merely because of policy disagreement with Congress.” In re \nAiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n110.  If the President “has policy reasons . . . for wanting to spend less than the full \namount appropriated by Congress for a particular project or program . . . the President must \npropose the recission of funds, and Congress may then decide whether to approve a rescission \nbill.” Id. at 261 n.1. \n111.  Defendants did not follow that process here, and their refusal to make available the \nfunds Congress appropriated for BRIC grants in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and \ntheir plan to instead return those funds to the Treasury is unlawful.  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 28 of 68\n112.  To the extent FEMA is withholding any other Congressionally appropriated funds, \nsuch as funds directed to particular BRIC projects through Congressionally directed spending or \nfunds left over from when the program was called Pre-Disaster Mitigation, that, too, is unlawful. \n2.  Moving the BRIC funds out of the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster \nMitigation Fund to spend on other programs is unlawful. \n113.  When Congress authorized FEMA to set aside funds from the Disaster Relief Fund \nfor the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund, it intended for those funds to \nbe used for BRIC grants, not for other programs. So Congress took measures to ensure that funds \nthat are set aside for BRIC are used for BRIC.  \n114.  First, Congress provided that once BRIC projects are selected (i.e., once BRIC \nfunds are allocated to a State), FEMA cannot withdraw those funds unless they remain unobligated \nat “the end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal year for which the amounts were allocated.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(A). And even then, any withdrawn funds must be returned to the National \nPublic Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and reallocated to new BRIC projects the \nfollowing year. 42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3)(B). \n115.  Second, Congress has barred DHS and FEMA from repurposing grant funds in its \nappropriations Acts. In 2024, Congress instructed DHS and FEMA that “no funds shall be \nreprogrammed within or transferred between appropriations to increase or decrease funding for \ngrant programs,” and Congress has carried this restriction forward.43 So FEMA cannot take funds \nset aside for BRIC grants and spend them on other programs. See 6 U.S.C. § 316(d) (confirming \nthat Defendants are required to follow restrictions in appropriations Acts). \n \n43 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L.

But FEMA revealed in June that in April it had initiated a “Reversal of Building \nInfrastructure and Communities Set Aside” and unlawfully diverted $4.071 billion out of the \nNational Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund into the Major Declarations component \nof the Disaster Relief Fund, which is used to fund post-disaster grants.44  \nI.  FEMA’s Termination of BRIC Has Caused, and Is Continuing to Cause, Irreparable \nHarm to Plaintiff States and Communities Around the Country \n117.  FEMA’s termination of the BRIC program has caused serious harm. Not only are \nStates unable to move forward with many of their planned projects, they also risk wasting the \nsubstantial time, effort, and money they have already invested in these projects, and undermining \nthe trust they have built with local communities and industry partners, which will make it harder \nto undertake projects like this in the future. Each day that passes causes more harm and increases \nthe chances that these projects will not be able to go forward, as communities face expiring permits, \nescalating costs, and eroding stakeholder trust. And since BRIC grants account for most of the \nfunding for these projects, if the termination is not reversed, many of these projects will have to \nbe scaled back, delayed, or canceled entirely. That would deprive communities around the country \nof the economic benefits these projects will bring and, most importantly, leave them more \nvulnerable to natural disasters for years to come. \n118.  The following are just a few examples of the projects that FEMA’s termination of \nthe BRIC program has put at risk. \n \n44  See  FEMA,  Disaster  Relief  Fund:  Monthly  Report  as  of  April  30,  2025  at  4  (2025), \nhttps://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ocfo_may-2025-disaster-relief-fund-report_06042025.pdf \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 30 of 68\nWASHINGTON \nNorth Shore Leveee and North Shore Levee West \n119.  Located  on  Washington’s  rural  Western  coastline,  Aberdeen  and  Hoquiam’s \nworking-class communities have experienced decades of severe flooding caused by intense rainfall \nand coastal surges. As a direct response to these recurring disasters, Washington applied for BRIC \nfunding to construct concrete floodwalls, miles of earthen levees, and raised roadways that would \nprotect these communities from further damage. Once completed, these levees would protect 1,354 \nbusiness, 5,100 properties, and more than 3,000 jobs located in the designated flood zone. They \nwould also reduce construction and insurance costs, leaving more than $5 million per year in \nresidents’ pockets, and promote economic development and future investments. \n120.  FEMA selected the projects years ago, allocating $50 million to the North Shore \nLevee Project and $47.5 million to the North Shore Levee West Project. In anticipation of federal \nfunding, State and local partners invested over $31 million of their own funds in project design, \npermitting, and pre-construction work. After years of rigorous environmental review, Hoquiam’s \nNorth Shore Levee West project received a Finding of No Significant Impact from FEMA on \nMarch 25, 2025, which was the last step before the paperwork could be finalized and the project \ncould move forward. \n121.  But just days later, Defendants shut down the BRIC program, and it is now unclear \nif these projects will ever get built. These communities cannot fund the projects on their own, and \nwithout federal funds, they may need to cancel them entirely. If that were to occur, all the time, \neffort, and money the State and local partners invested in the project would be wasted, and the \ncommunity would likely continue to face recurrent severe flooding.  \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 31 of 68\nGoldendale Emergency Preparedness Microgrid \n122.  Klickitat County is a rural community in southern Washington that frequently loses \npower during wildfires and severe weather. To help protect the community during power outages, \nWashington applied for a BRIC grant to construct a solar and battery microgrid that would allow \nthe local hospital and a nearby school district to generate their own electricity so that they could \nsupport critical operations even when the grid goes down. This emergency power source would \nensure that local residents can receive the medical care they need during emergencies while also \nproviding a sheltering place, with electricity, for more than 9,000 residents frequently at risk of \nlosing power. \n123.  FEMA selected the project and allocated more than $9 million toward it. Phase I \ndesign, final engineering estimates, and permitting were completed in March 2025, and the next \nstep was for a Phase II amendment, which would allow for construction to begin. But Defendants \nshut down the BRIC program a few weeks later, and without BRIC funding, this community will \nbe forced to scale back the project so much that the rural hospital will be unable to maintain many \nof its critical services during outage-causing events, and the school facility will not be fully \nequipped to provide safe and sanitary emergency sheltering. \nMASSACHUSETTS  \n124.  In Massachusetts, FEMA awarded almost $50 million in BRIC funds to the cities \nof Chelsea and Everett, for the Island End River Coastal Flood Resilience Project, the largest grant \nto the Commonwealth. This grant was a significant contribution to a $120 million project designed \naddress the catastrophic flooding of Island End River during severe coastal storms. The project \nwas intended to fund a $42 million underground storm surge control facility, 4,460 linear-foot \nstorm surge barrier, revamped riverwalk, and 18,000 square feet of nature-based resilience \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 32 of 68\nimprovements that include wetland upgrades and a restored salt marsh. The loss of BRIC funding \nfor the Island End River Flood Barrier project puts at risk over $7 billion in annual economic \nactivity, access to the region’s supply of fresh produce, a major and vital transportation corridor, \nand the safety of more than 5,000 residents living in the floodplain.  \n125.  Also in Massachusetts, the Town of Manchester-by-the-Sea was awarded almost \n$5 million in BRIC funds to replace the town’s Central Street Bridge and remove a collapsing \nculvert. The existing Central Street Bridge, which serves a major roadway and is the town’s main \nthoroughfare, currently overtops during extreme storms and is structurally deficient. A culvert \nfailure would have major consequences to transportation and community safety including response \ntimes for emergency services, impacts to schools, transportation of goods and services, access to \ngovernment services, and loss of utility services for all of Cape Ann as this bridge carries the entire \nelectric supply to all four Cape Ann towns. \nARIZONA \n126.  Between  2020  and  2023,  Arizona  was  selected  for  25  BRIC  grants,  totaling \n$9.8 million dollars. Roughly $1.2 million of these funds were directed to the State for salaries and \nother management costs. Because of the BRIC termination, Arizona will not receive the full \namount of state management costs.  \n127.  The  remaining  BRIC  funding  supports  critical  disaster  mitigation  projects, \nincluding a $4.6 million infrastructure project in the City of Buckeye, Arizona. The City regularly \nexperience floods that threaten the safety of its businesses and families. The BRIC funding would \nhave been used to divert floodwater away from the historic downtown by connecting the drainage \nsystem to existing irrigation canals and constructing a retention basin to collect the floodwater. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 33 of 68\n128.  The Town of Camp Verde, Arizona was similarly selected for a roughly $860,000 \nBRIC grant to secure a major roadway against flooding. The roadway, Verde Lakes Drive, \nsustained significant damage from floods in March 2023, resulting in a declaration of emergency \nin Camp Verde. The BRIC grant would fund flood mitigation improvements and secure the area \nagainst flooding. \n129.  Arizona does not have the budgetary resources or flexibility to make up for the lost \nfunding without drawing funding away from other important initiatives. Without BRIC funding, \nArizona is facing an increased risk of lost lives, property damage, and public safety burdens. \nCALIFORNIA \n130.  FEMA selected the City of Rancho Palos Verdes’ subapplication for a $32.99 \nmillion project under the BRIC program. That grant would have funded a project to reduce \ngeologic landslide movement that threatens most  of the City’s residents and infrastructure, \nincluding a major arterial roadway that provides community and emergency access, sanitation \nsewer lines located along this roadway, electric and communication lines, potable water lines, and \ngas lines. The project would reduce risk of sudden/major land movement that could cause the \nabove infrastructure to fail and threaten over 15,000 homes and nearly 40,000 people. This \nlandslide movement involves one of the largest continuously active landslides in the United States \nand has already resulted in significant damage. With this project, the City could take important \nsteps to stop or slow this ongoing movement. But without this project, this landslide movement \nwill continue to threaten critical infrastructure, damage homes and property, and endanger lives. \nThe landslide movement is irreversible after it occurs. \n131.  FEMA selected the City of Sacramento’s subapplication for a $21.36 million \nproject under the BRIC program. The grant would have funded a project to mitigate flooding of \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 34 of 68\nfive major interchanges, 3.9 miles of a major interstate highway, a runway at an airport, surface \nstreets, 27,000 housing units, and more. Among other things, the project would have improved \nfloodwall sections, improved levee sections, and relocated a pump station. The U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers considers the Sacramento region to be one of the most at-risk regions, if not the most \nat-risk region, in the country for “catastrophic” flooding, noting that it relies on an aging system \nto reduce its flood risk. \n132.  FEMA selected Kern County’s subapplication for a $32.39 million project under \nthe BRIC program. The grant would have funded a project to seismically retrofit the Kern Valley \nHealthcare District’s hospital that provides acute care and emergency medical services to a remote \npopulation in the mid-northern region of the Kern River Valley area. Unless seismically retrofitted, \nthe hospital may soon need to close. This would force hundreds of thousands of Californians to \nseek services at hospitals over two hours away. \nCOLORADO \nCity of Greeley Goldhill Pipeline Project \n133.  This project, which was Identified for Further Review in BRIC FY 2022, would \nprotect the City of Greeley’s water supply against climate-related and human-made hazards. \nGreeley  relies  on  two  water  treatment  plants,  but  the  current  transmission  system  lacks  a \nconnection between the two plants, making the system vulnerable to water shortages and rationing \nif one plant needs to be taken offline. The proposed project would have built a pipeline to allow \ntreated water to flow in both directions between the plants, thereby increasing flexibility in water \nmanagement, maximizing the benefits of diversified water sources, and making sure the system \ncan respond effectively to the hazards of wildfire, drought, and cyberattack. The Greeley project \nwould have benefitted 152,861 residents of Greeley, Windsor, Milliken, and Evans along with \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 35 of 68\napproximately 6,000 students at the University of Northern Colorado. Between 40 and 50 percent \nof the benefitting population is considered vulnerable under multiple socio-economic factors. The \ntotal cost of the Greeley project is $18,425,795.28. If the project had moved forward under the \nBRIC program, FEMA would have contributed $13,819,346.46 of the costs. \nCONNECTICUT \n134.  The BRIC 2022 Resilient Bridgeport Coastal Flood Defense System (“Resilient \nBridgeport”) was developed to address recurrent flooding and coastal storm surge risks affecting \nBridgeport’s South End, an area repeatedly impacted by major storm events. Bridgeport is \nConnecticut’s most populous city and the fifth largest city in New England. It sits at the mouth of \nthe Pequonnock River on Long Island Sound and houses the I-95 corridor, one of the busiest \ninterstate thoroughfares connecting the New York metropolitan area with New England. \n135.  The key project objectives included: protecting approximately 65 acres within the \n100-year  floodplain  from  storm  surge,  flooding,  and  future  sea  level  rise  (up  to  2.5  feet); \nsafeguarding  two  critical  power-generating  facilities  capable  of  supplying  electricity  to \napproximately  1.1  million  homes;  constructing  comprehensive  flood  defense  infrastructure, \nincluding floodwalls, raised roads, stormwater management systems, and a proposed resilience \nhub; and reducing long-term flood risk, displacement, and infrastructure damage, while enhancing \nemergency response capabilities. \n136.  The BRIC project termination means not only a loss of the anticipated $47 million \nin BRIC program funds, but that Bridgeport’s South End remains fully exposed to future flooding \nevents. This unmitigated flood risk impacts residential communities, including low-income and \nvulnerable populations. There is an ongoing vulnerability of two major power generation facilities, \nrisking widespread power outages affecting over 1 million homes.  \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 36 of 68\nDELAWARE \n137.  The Delaware Emergency Management Agency was forced to cancel 11 projects \nas a result of the cancelation of the BRIC Program. Among the canceled projects, was a project to \nimprove storm water management in Lewes, Delaware. Flooding events in this area may result in \nlarge scale losses including causing damage to structures and homes. In addition, failure to \nproperly mitigate flood waters in this area could result in eliminating access to homes, disruption \nof  water  and  sanitary  and  sewer  services,  and  have  additional  determinantal  impacts  on \ndownstream roads, residences, and business. The purpose of this now canceled project was to \ncreate infrastructure to avoid stormwater runoff inundation on downstream streets and properties. \n138.  The cancellation of the BRIC program is devastating for Delaware. In addition to \nthe lost federal funding, DEMA and its subgrantees have invested time, study, and their own \nfinancial  resources  into  planning,  design,  public  engagement,  environmental  review,  and \npermitting for BRIC projects intended to protect communities and critical infrastructure from \nnatural disasters and extreme weather events. Moreover, each BRIC project requires conducting a \nrigorous cost-benefit analysis that ensures the project will be cost-effective. That time and effort \nand those financial resources will be wasted if FEMA will not consider or fund these projects. \n139.  Many of the BRIC projects in Delaware cannot move forward without BRIC \nfunding. As a result of the termination of the BRIC program, Delaware is facing an increased risk \nof lost lives, property damage, and public safety burdens. Delaware does not have the budgetary \nresources or flexibility to make up for the lost funding without drawing funding away from other \nimportant initiatives. \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 37 of 68\nILLINOIS \n140.  Two of the subgrantees selected for BRIC funding in Illinois from Federal Fiscal \nYears 2020 through 2023, are the Village of DePue, and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation \nDistrict of Greater Chicago (MWRD), which were awarded grant funding for specific flood \nmitigation projects. These two projects are crucial for major critical infrastructure protections for \nresidents of the State of Illinois, including agriculture and healthcare infrastructure. \n141.  The Village of DePue is a Central Illinois community of approximately 1,600 \nresidents in Bureau County on the shores of Lake DePue and near the Illinois River. DePue must \nmove its vulnerable wastewater treatment plant out of a FEMA recognized regulatory floodway to \nreduce the risk of catastrophic flooding of this critical infrastructure and mitigate the risk of \nsignificant public health, environmental, and economic harm. Relocation is essential to safeguard \nclean drinking water for the community, prevent raw sewage from backing into homes, and protect \nagainst contamination of Lake DePue—a national powerboat championship site—and the Illinois \nRiver, which affect downstream communities including Peoria, Hennepin, and Pekin, along with \nregional farms and rural manufacturing. The wastewater treatment plant has already faced severe \nhistorical flooding, with the Illinois River nearly breaching its levee in 2008 and 2013. \n142.  BRIC funding is critical for this project not only because of present and future risk, \nbut also due to DePue's historical environmental and economic challenges as the city is home to a \nSuperfund Site from early 20th-century zinc smelting and fertilizer production that left toxic waste \nin the community and that limits the City’s available resources to address on-going environmental \nchallenges.  Moving  the  plant  will  protect  public  health,  the  environment,  and  the  region's \neconomy. \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 38 of 68\n143.  Another BRIC funded project in Illinois, the MWRD project, seeks to reduce major \nflooding of critical infrastructure in the Des Plaines River Valley by addressing a growing and \ncostly flood risk within the Prairie Creek sub-watershed. Past floods include a 1986 event that \ncaused an estimated $35 million in damage and forced over 15,000 evacuations, as well as \nsignificant historical flooding of this sub-watershed in August 2007, September 2008, and April \n2013, which demonstrate an ongoing threat to the community. \n144.  The MWRD project aims to directly reduce the risk of such widespread disruption \nin the Des Plaines River Valley communities, including Maine Township, Park Ridge, and Des \nPlaines, Illinois. It is also essential to safeguard a vital healthcare lifeline by protecting critical \naccess routes to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, a Level I Trauma Center and one of the \nlargest hospitals in the Chicago area. Advocate Lutheran General provides comprehensive and \nspecialized  care  to  serve  the  healthcare  needs  of  tens  of  thousands  of  residents  across  28 \ncommunities within Chicago, Cook County, and Lake County, Illinois. Ensuring uninterrupted \naccess to this facility during a flood is critical for the health and safety of the hospital’s extensive \nservice population. \nMAINE \nYork County Coastal Sand Dune Restoration and Protection Initiative \n145.  In January 2024, coastal flooding in southern Maine caused $70 million in damage \nto public and private property and infrastructure. The flooding destroyed large stretches of \ncoastline, which is a critical resource for both Maine residents and its tourism industry, which is a \nvital part of the State’s economy. In addition to the immediate damage, the flooding caused \nsignificant destruction of the dunes that provide a protective buffer for coastal properties, leaving \nthem even more vulnerable to future storms. In response and with the support of BRIC funding, \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 39 of 68\nthe York County Emergency Management Agency developed a BRIC application for the York \nCounty Coastal Sand Dune Restoration and Protection Initiative to commence a comprehensive \nphased project to rebuild dunes and widen beaches in a climate-resilient way. The project is \nintended to better protect critical infrastructure, homes, and businesses from future storms. With \nthe cancellation of BRIC FY24, the region lost $41.4 million in potential funding. Without \nengineering studies and mitigation efforts, these communities remain exposed to worsening storm \nimpacts. \nMARYLAND \n146.  In  Maryland,  the  City  of  Crisfield  had  been  working  on  community-driven \nsolutions to its longstanding and severe flooding challenges for years. Crisfield applied for BRIC \nfunds in FFY23 and was later selected for further review by FEMA, a promising sign for the \ncommunity which holds a high-risk score of 85.36 on FEMA’s National Risk Index. [Phase/Stage] \nOne of the project, if approved, would offer $36 million in federal funds, which would be \ntransformational to the flood mitigation efforts of the city, which was founded in 1663 and is home \nto 2,475 residents today. FEMA’s termination of the BRIC program now puts Crisfield’s entire \nflood mitigation project at risk, since many of the non-federal resources the city leveraged to meet \nits expected federal cost-share responsibilities required the city to have a comprehensive funding \nplan in place, which includes the expected federal BRIC funds \nMICHIGAN \n147.  Two related flood reduction/stormwater infrastructure improvement projects in \nsoutheast Michigan. Stormwater related flooding in this area has resulted in costly federal disaster \ndeclarations in 2000, 2014, and 2021. These BRIC projects, one for the City of Detroit and one for \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 40 of 68\nthe  City  of  Hamtramck,  were  projects  to  improve  the  stormwater  infrastructure  in  those \ncommunities to help prevent stormwater flooding disasters in the future.  \n148.  A $2,000,000 award to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory’s \nBureau of Construction Codes that would have funded a dedicated project team to assess the needs \nof local governments and building inspectors to identify gaps in code inspectors’ knowledge of \nbuilding codes as Michigan transitions through the adoption of the 2021 and 2024 suites of \nbuilding codes developed by the International Code Council (“ICC”) and adopted by the State. \nThe project team intended to use this needs assessment to develop educational materials on the \nlatest building codes adopted by the state and deliver training and outreach programs to enhance \ncode knowledge and compliance of building inspectors, design professionals, and contractors. The \nfunding was also to be used to purchase enhanced code materials and analysis published by the \nICC for inspectors in the bureau and working in local units of government to improve and ensure \nthe consistency of code application in plan reviews and inspections. Additionally, the project team \nintended to work partner organizations to develop the skilled workforce needed by the state and \nlocal units of government to enforce building codes across the state. \nMINNESOTA \n149.  In the State of Minnesota, BRIC funding is primarily used by counties to update \ntheir hazard mitigation plans on a five-year cycle. At the time of writing, terminated BRIC funding \nwas slated to support thirty-four Minnesota counties in updating their current plans. The process \nof updating a plan requires substantial time and resources to ensure the inclusion of accurate, \nquantifiable data. BRIC funding enables jurisdictions to engage qualified consultants to support \nand guide this process. The hazard mitigation plans serve as foundational documents that provide \njurisdictions with a comprehensive understanding of their current threat and risk landscape, and \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 41 of 68\nthey outline specific strategies to reduce or eliminate risks associated with identified hazards. \nMoreover, these plans are a federal requirement for jurisdictions seeking eligibility for post-\ndisaster assistance, as outlined in Section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. § 5165. Disrupting these plans will have compounding \nnegative consequences for Minnesota residents during and post-disaster. \nNEW JERSEY \nNJWSA Spruce Run Dam Foundation Grouting Project \n150.  New Jersey is using BRIC funds to strengthen the Spruce Run Reservoir Dam, part \nof the Raritan Basin System that supplies water to 1.5 million residents. The project will protect \napproximately 249,000 people and associated infrastructure by restoring the dam’s integrity, \npreventing potential dam failure, and reducing downstream flood risk from this Class 1 High \nHazard Potential Dam, which stores 11 billion gallons of water. \nPANYNJ Elevation-Floodproofing of Building 111 Infrastructure Mitigation \n151.  New Jersey is also using BRIC funds to elevate and floodproof critical electrical \nand mechanical systems at Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal’s primary water and fire pump \nstation. The project will benefit over 20,000 port workers and protect hundreds of critical structures \nby ensuring uninterrupted firefighting, potable water, and transportation operations at one of the \nnation’s busiest ports. \nNEW YORK \n152.  New York is slated to receive $50 million from the BRIC program for the Seaport \nCostal Resilience Project (project number EMN-2021-BR-069-0012 ) (SCRP), a multi-phased \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 42 of 68\nproject45 aimed at protecting (i) New York City residents and (ii) City property and infrastructure \nfrom the risks associated with rising sea levels, increased rain events, and the impact of extreme \nheat, all of which are exacerbated by climate change. The Project would reduce flood risk through \ninnovative design and engineering strategies that will integrate flood protection into a public \nesplanade and historic district, improve access to the waterfront, and implement green and nature-\nbased solutions to improve marine habitat and address the urban heat island effect. The Project \nwill directly protect 91 buildings, including New York City Housing Authority buildings, and \ncritical transportation routes in the Financial District. Further, SCRP will be integrated into a \nbroader infrastructure project, the ”Big U,” aimed at protecting lower Manhattan from the climate \nchange impacts of floodwater and stormwater events. The cost-benefit calculation of SCRP, \nincluding mitigations, is more than $681 million in benefits. In April 2025, the City sought, but \nhad not yet received a response, to an extension request to complete the grant activities associated \nwith SCRP. \n153.  New York State has 31 open BRIC projects totaling $244,526,656 benefiting the \nCity of New York and other municipalities throughout the State, with an additional 7 projects \ntotaling $138,008,847 from the BRIC 2022 and 2023 grant cycles that have been selected but not \nyet awarded. These projects are  all in jeopardy of being defunded  as a result of FEMA’s \nconstructive termination of the BRIC program. If FEMA does not extend periods of performance \nor approve additional project phases, it will significantly impact the State’s ability to prepare for \ndisasters and prevent loss of life and property resulting from hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, or other \nnatural hazards. \n \n45 Phase 1 of the project (appx. 7.5mm) includes environmental reviews, regulatory and permitting \napprovals, design completion and stakeholder engagement; phase 2 of the project (appx. 43mm) includes the \nimplementation of the project. \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 43 of 68\n154.  For  example,  the  BRIC  funding  is  being  used  for  the  Upper  Minkel  Dam \nDecommissioning and Riparian Corridor Restoration project. This project would remove the \nUpper Minkel Dam, a high hazard Class \"C\" Dam in Westchester County, and restore the stream \nand surrounding land which would significantly reduce the potential flood hazard associated with \nthe dam. The design will allow for a low flow channel into Purdy Pond and includes a higher \nelevation flood storage shelf that will reduce, and possibly eliminate, future flood events. The \nTown of New Castle will not be able to complete the project if FEMA does not approve Phase 2 \nconstruction. \n155.  New York State received 37 applications from 26 State and local subapplicants \ntotaling $290 million that it intended to submit to FEMA in response to the BRIC 2024 NOFO. \nNORTH CAROLINA \n156.  The State of North Carolina is a sovereign state of the United States of America. \nNorth Carolina is represented by Attorney General Jeff Jackson who is the chief law enforcement \nofficer of North Carolina. \n157.  Rowan County and the City of Salisbury, North Carolina have experienced multi-\nday shutdowns of the pump station that provides drinking water to over 50,000 of their residents \nbecause of flooding and hazardous conditions at the station. The City of Salisbury was selected for \na FY 2021 BRIC grant of approximately $22.5 million, which would improve water supply \nresiliency by relocating the pump station to an area where it could be safely accessed during \nstorms. The City of Salisbury has invested over $3 million in engineering fees alone for the project. \nFEMA obligated funds for this project but then cancelled the BRIC program before construction \ncould begin. The sudden withdrawal of funds for the project imperils its future. \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 44 of 68\nOREGON \n158.  BRIC funding is administered in Oregon by the Oregon Department of Emergency \nManagement (OEM)—a state agency that coordinates and maintains a statewide emergency \nservices system for emergency and disaster communications. Oregon and its subgrantees have 29 \nopen projects selected for BRIC funding in the amount of $128,736,327.  \n159.  For example, a project in Oregon’s Clatsop County was selected for BRIC funding \nto assist with tsunami and earthquake preparedness. Clatsop County includes a substantial portion \nof the Oregon coastline, which is especially vulnerable to a potential earthquake and tsunami \ncaused by the Cascadia Subduction Zone. The project in Clatstop County seeks to integrate a \nTsunami Vertical Evacuation Refuge Structure into a community hospital. This would create a \nmulti-purpose structure to provide a shelter for the hospital patients and staff, as well as members \nof the general population in the hospital’s immediate vicinity, that is elevated level above the \npredicted tsunami inundation levels. The total estimated cost of this project is $19,853,032, of \nwhich the federal government was expected to contribute $13,897,122 through BRIC. BRIC’s \ntermination places the impending construction phase of this project in jeopardy; neither the County \nnor the State can afford to resume the project without federal funding. \n160.  BRIC’s termination would also imperil a project to improve the Medford Water \nCommission’s water distribution system. That project seeks to improve the system’s resilience to \nseismic  risk,  wildfires,  and  droughts  by  creating  a  “backbone”  water  supply  for  critical \ninfrastructure in the City of Medford and the surrounding area. This project was selected for \n$34,806,505 in BRIC funding, and in a site visit late last year, FEMA staff indicated that the grant \nwas on track for those funds to be obligated by the summer of 2025. The potential loss of those \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 45 of 68\nfunds would imperil the broader project’s scope which, in its entirety, will cost four times the \namount of the federally-funded portion. \n161.  BRIC’s termination also imperils an effort to relocate the City of Grants Pass’s \nexisting water treatment plant outside of a special flood hazard area and replace it with a facility \nthat is resistant to seismic activity, drought, and extreme weather. An application seeking $50 \nmillion of BRIC funds for this project was selected for funding, and based on a meeting with \nFEMA in late 2024, the community anticipated that federal funds would be obligated by summer \nof 2025. \n162.  OEM has also invested substantial state administrative resources—including three \nfull-time employees along with private, contracted consultants—to help bridge the gap between \nsmaller Oregon communities seeking BRIC funding and larger communities with more resources. \nBRIC’s termination would leave OEM with roughly $200,000 of uncompensated costs resulting \nfrom these efforts that otherwise would have been reimbursed by federal funds. This would place \na significant unanticipated strain on OEM’s resources. \nPENNSYLVANIA \n163.  Pennsylvania had 47 projects competitively selected between FY2020 and FY2023 \nthat have now been terminated. The federal share for these projects was over $130 million. \nPennsylvania is one of 16 states with an Enhanced Hazard Mitigation Plan and the selected projects \nwere pieces of Pennsylvania’s enhanced mitigation strategy. \n164.  One $2 million award would have allowed the placement of a HESCO flood barrier \nin the Eastwick neighborhood of Southwest Philadelphia. Eastwick is a residential neighborhood \nwith about 12,000 people that sits along the Delaware River. It has repeatedly experienced losses \nbecause of flooding. The barrier was a critical piece of a larger scale mitigation strategy being \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 46 of 68\nimplemented  by  Pennsylvania,  the  City  of  Philadelphia,  the  United  States  Army  Corps  of \nEngineers, United States Fish & Wildlife and FEMA.   \n165.  Two separate $50 million awards would have supported two Philadelphia Water \nDepartment pump stations. One of those awards would have been used to build gates to prevent \nflood water from entering the 42nd Street pump station, increased that pump station’s capacity \nfrom 8 million gallons per day to 100 million gallons per day, and improved its operational quality \nfor both normal and storm operations. Those enhancements would have delivered better water \nservice to the local community, reduced overflows into the Schuylkill River, and better protected \nthe neighborhood from flooding impacts. The second award, for which Philadelphia committed to \novermatch the federal award, would have achieved similar ends in Northeast Philadelphia.  \n166.  Yet another award for about $2.7 million would have been used to acquire and \ndemolish  21  properties  in  Scranton—a  community  of  around  80,000—that  have  sustained \nrepetitive flood losses. Scranton intended to eliminate future losses for the homeowners and return \nthe parcels to their natural state \n167.  Two awards selected for FY2022, for which the federal share totaled more than $10 \nmillion, would have significantly contributed to mitigating flood impacts sustained over the years \nin Dover Township, York County and Bridgeville Borough, Allegheny County. The mitigation \nproject in Dover, a township with about 22,000 people, would have enhanced the flood storage \nand attenuation capacity of Little Conewago Creek. The Bridgeville Borough award was part of \nan effort to upsize stormwater culverts, install two screw pumps, install initial levee walls, and \nperform grading to create additional capacity for Chartiers Creek. Most of Bridgeville Borough’s \n5,000 residents live near the project area. \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 47 of 68\n168.  Pennsylvania,  through  the  Pennsylvania  Emergency  Management  Agency \n(PEMA), and local government sub-applicants had invested significant time and money into \npreparing applications for each of BRIC’s application periods. \n169.  Pennsylvania also was ready to apply for 22 projects for FY2024, seeking more \nthan $25 million from FEMA. \nRHODE ISLAND \n170.  The University of Rhode Island (URI) and its subgrantees have 1 open project \nselected for BRIC funding from Federal Fiscal Years 2020 through 2023 in the amount of \n$348,978.18. This project is called Seamless Web-based Flood Risk Mapping Tool for Coastal \nand Inland Waters of RI in a Changing Climate; extension of STORMTOOLS using FEMA maps \nand hydrological modeling.  \n171.  URI’s BRIC project cannot move forward without BRIC funding. As a result of the \ntermination of the BRIC program, Rhode Island will have less data and information regarding \ninland flooding and inland flood risk. Additionally, due to the loss of future funding opportunities \nwithout the BRIC program, Rhode Island is facing an increased risk of lost lives, property damage, \nand public safety burdens due to a loss of ability to predict and model storms.  \nVERMONT \n172.  In Vermont, BRIC funding has been predominately used for planning and scoping \nactivities. Planning funding is typically for the development of Local Hazard Mitigation Plans \n(LHMPs). These plans are required to apply for funding under all FEMA Hazard Mitigation \nAssistance  (HMA)  programs.  Scoping  projects  are  to  complete  design  work  and  develop \ninfrastructure applications. Annual BRIC funding allowed Vermont communities to plan future \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 48 of 68\nrisk reduction for all natural hazards and to design flood reduction projects to ensure readiness \nfollowing disasters. \n173.  For example, a Lower Whetstone Brook Project Scoping Study in Brattleboro, \nVermont, totaling $127,760 (federal share), has previously been selected under this grant and has \nnow been cancelled. This project was developed to assess floodplain restoration opportunities in a \nstretch of river with the potential to significantly reduce flood levels during high-flow storm events \nin a heavily populated downtown area.  \n174.  Another project, Flat Iron Bridge Project Scoping in Wolcott, Vermont, totaling \n$71,250, has previously been selected under this grant in Vermont and has now been cancelled. \nThis project would greatly benefit a community that experienced heavy flooding in Vermont’s \nJuly 2023 major flood event by developing plans to upsize their infrastructure and reduce flood \nrisk to residents. \nWISCONSIN \n175.  In Wisconsin, the Potosi School District was selected to receive $2,736,800 in \nFY22 for a community tornado shelter to provide near-absolute life safety protection for 886 \noccupants against 250 mile per hour wind speeds. The nearby Village of Cuba City was selected \nto receive $8,319,451 in FY22 to construct a multi-use tornado shelter, rated to provide near-\nabsolute life safety protection for 2,333 occupants against 250 mile per hour wind speeds. Both \nprojects had undergone a lengthy and thorough FEMA review and were ready for obligation by \nFEMA prior to the cancellation of the BRIC program. The communities of Potosi and Cuba City \nhad also passed referenda to secure matching funds for the grants. \n176.  Potosi and Cuba City, where tornado safe room projects were cancelled, lie in an \narea of Wisconsin that is among the highest risk for tornadoes. The county has averaged a tornado \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 49 of 68\nevery year since 1950. In 2024, a tornado touched down only 1.4 miles away from the planned \nsafe room in Potosi. \n177.  The Town of Whitestown, located along the Kickapoo River in one of the most \nflood-prone areas of the state, was selected to receive $131,366 in FY23 to protect a bridge against \nscouring during flooding events. The Kickapoo River is prone to flooding annually and regularly \ncauses damage to the communities along its riverbanks. Record-setting rainfall of 12 or more \ninches in some areas caused major flooding down the entire span of the river in August 2018. \nWithout the Town of Whitestown bridge improvements, the bridge will become impassable during \nthe next flooding event, leaving residents stranded from emergency police, fire, and EMS services. \nScouring could also eventually lead to bridge collapse. This project had likewise undergone a \nlengthy  and  thorough  FEMA  review  and  was  ready  for  obligation  by  FEMA  prior  to  the \ncancellation of the BRIC program. \nV.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Separation of Powers \n(Termination of BRIC Program – Substantially Reducing Mitigation Functions) \n \n178.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n179.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc, \n575 U.S. 320, 326–27 (2015). \n180.  The Constitution provides that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.  \n181.  Executive Branch agencies’ “power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively \nprescribed by Congress.” City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013). That means an \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 50 of 68\nagency “literally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it,” La. \nPub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986), and that an agency “may not ignore \nstatutory mandates or prohibitions merely because of policy disagreement with Congress,” In re \nAiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n182.  Congress has not authorized Defendants to terminate the BRIC program. \n183.  In fact, Congress has prohibited it: Congress barred Defendants from “substantially \nor  significantly”  reducing  “the  authorities,  responsibilities,  or  functions  of  [FEMA]  or  the \ncapability  of  the  Agency  to  perform  those  missions,  authorities,  responsibilities,  except  as \notherwise specifically provided in an Act enacted after October 4, 2006.” 6 U.S.C. § 316(c)(1).  \n184.  Congress has expressly provided by law that mitigating against future disasters is, \nand must remain, one of FEMA’s core functions: FEMA’s “primary mission . . . is to reduce the \nloss  of  life  and  property  and  protect  the  Nation  from  all  hazards”  through  “a  risk-based, \ncomprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, \nand mitigation.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(1) (emphasis added). \n185.  And Congress instructed that the “Administrator shall provide Federal leadership \nnecessary to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, or mitigate against, a natural \ndisaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster, including . . . by leading and supporting the \nNation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of mitigation, by taking \nsustained actions to reduce or eliminate long-term risks to people and property from hazards and \ntheir effects.” 6 U.S.C. § 314(a)(9)(A) (emphasis added). \n186.  Congress  has  not  enacted  any  statute  “after  October  4,  2006”  “specifically” \nauthorizing Defendants to terminate the BRIC program or reduce FEMA’s mitigation functions \nand capabilities. \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 51 of 68\n187.  Defendants’ shuttering of FEMA’s flagship pre-disaster mitigation program and \nwithholding of billions of dollars intended for pre-disaster mitigation runs afoul of these laws.  \n188.  Congress determined decades ago, when it codified the pre-disaster mitigation \nprogram, that FEMA’s existing mitigation programs alone were not sufficient to fulfill FEMA’s \nmitigation mission. And Congress reaffirmed BRIC’s importance in 2018, when it provided a new \nfunding stream for the program, and again in 2021, when it appropriated another $1 billion dollars \ntoward it. At every turn Congress has made clear that FEMA needs to engage in more pre-disaster \nmitigation to fulfill its mission, not less, and Congress has barred Defendants from unilaterally \ncountermanding that judgment. See, e.g., 6 U.S.C. §§ 313(b)(1), 316(c)(1). \n189.  The Court should therefore enjoin FEMA’s termination of the BRIC program as a \nviolation of the Separation of Powers. \nVI.  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nAdministrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Contrary to Law, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(C) \n(Termination of BRIC Program – Substantially Reducing Mitigation Functions) \n \n190.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n191.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might have \ncarried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” Loper Bright \nEnters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 391 (2024) (quotations omitted). The APA thus provides that \ncourts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is contrary to law. 5 U.S. C. § \n706(2)(A)–(C). \n192.  Defendants are agencies under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1). \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 52 of 68\n193.  Defendants  took  final  agency  action  when  Defendants  terminated  the  BRIC \nprogram and implemented the termination. \n194.  Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program is contrary to law because Congress \nhas not authorized them to terminate the BRIC program or substantially reduce FEMA’s mitigation \nfunctions and capabilities. In fact, Congress has specifically barred it. See 6 U.S.C. §§ 316(c)(1), \n313(b)(1), 313(b)(2)(3), 314(a)(9)(A). Therefore, the BRIC termination violates these statutes and \nthe Separation of Powers.  \n195.  The Court should therefore set aside this unlawful agency action. \nVII.  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Separation of Powers \n(Repurposing BRIC Funds) \n \n196.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n197.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27. \n198.  Executive Branch agencies’ “power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively \nprescribed by Congress.” City of Arlington, 569 U.S. at 297. That means an agency “literally has \nno power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it,” La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. \nFCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986), and that an agency “may not ignore statutory mandates or \nprohibitions merely because of policy disagreement with Congress,” In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d \n255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n199.  When Congress authorized FEMA to set aside funds from the Disaster Relief Fund \nfor the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund, it intended for those funds to \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 53 of 68\nbe used for BRIC grants, not for other programs. So Congress took measures to ensure that funds \nthat are set aside for BRIC are used for BRIC.  \n200.  First, Congress provided that once BRIC projects are selected (i.e., once BRIC \nfunds are allocated to a State), FEMA cannot withdraw those funds unless they remain unobligated \n“at the end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal year for which the amounts were allocated.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3). And even then, any withdrawn funds must be returned to the National \nPublic Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and reallocated to new BRIC projects the \nfollowing year. Id. \n201.  Second, Congress has barred DHS and FEMA from repurposing grant funds in its \nappropriations Acts. In 2024, Congress instructed DHS and FEMA that “no funds shall be \nreprogrammed within or transferred between appropriations to increase or decrease funding for \ngrant programs,” and Congress has carried this restriction forward.46 So FEMA cannot take funds \nset aside for BRIC grants and spend them on other programs. See 6 U.S.C. § 316(d) (confirming \nthat Defendants are required to follow restrictions in appropriations Acts). \n202.  Nevertheless,  Defendants  initiated  a  “Reversal  of  Building  Infrastructure  and \nCommunities Set Aside” and unlawfully diverted $4.071 billion out of the National Public \nInfrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund into the Major Declarations component of the Disaster \nRelief Fund, which is used to fund post-disaster grants.  \n203.  This repurposing of BRIC funds for non-BRIC purposes is unlawful and should be \nenjoined.  \n \n46 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 503(d)(2), 138 Stat. 460, 615 (2024); \nsee also e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, § 1101, 139 Stat. 9, \n10 (2025) (appropriating funds “under the authority and conditions provided” in “the applicable appropriations Acts \nfor fiscal year 2024”). \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 54 of 68\nVIII.  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAdministrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Contrary to Law, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(C) \n(Repurposing BRIC Funds) \n \n204.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n205.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might have \ncarried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” Loper Bright, 603 \nU.S. at 391. The APA thus provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is contrary to law. 5 U.S. C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(C). \n206.  Defendants are agencies under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1). \n207.  Defendants took final agency action when Defendants moved funds set aside for \nthe BRIC program out of the National Public Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation Fund and into \nthe Major Declarations component of the Disaster Relief Fund so that they could be spent on other \nprograms.  \n208.  Defendants’ efforts to repurpose the funds Congress designated for BRIC violates \n42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3), the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, \n§ 503(d)(2), 138 Stat. 460, 614–15 (2024), Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions \nAct, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, § 1101, 139 Stat. 9, 10 (2025), and the Separation of Powers.  \n209.  The Court should therefore set aside this unlawful agency action. \nIX.  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Separation of Powers, Appropriations Clause, Spending Clause \n(Withholding Appropriated Funds) \n \n210.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 55 of 68\n211.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27. \n212.  The Constitution’s Spending Clause, art I, § 8, cl. 1, provides that Congress, not the \nExecutive, “shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imports, and Excises, to pay the \nDebts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” \n213.  The Constitution’s Appropriations Clause, art. I, § 9 cl. 7, provides that Congress, \nnot the Executive, has the power to appropriate money from the Treasury. \n214.  “Absent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or \nwithhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals.” City & County \nof  San  Francisco  v.  Trump,  897  F.3d  1225,  1235  (9th  Cir.  2018).  Doing  so  “violates  the \nconstitutional principle of the Separation of Powers.” Id. \n215.  In  the  bipartisan  Infrastructure  Investment  and  Jobs  Act  (“IIJA”),  Congress \nappropriated $1 billion dollars to the BRIC program. See Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, \nPub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, 1387 (2021). In doing so, Congress provided that “200,000,000 \nshall be made available” for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. Id. \n216.  FEMA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for BRIC grants for Fiscal Year \n2024 on January 6, 2025. The application submission deadline was April 18, 2025. \n217.  Plaintiff states then spent significant time and effort preparing applications for \nFiscal Year 2024 BRIC funds. \n218.  Roughly two weeks before the deadline, FEMA shut down the BRIC program, and \ntwo days before the deadline, FEMA announced that “the Fiscal Year 2024 BRIC funding \nopportunity is cancelled, no applications submitted will be reviewed and no funds will be \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 56 of 68\nawarded.”47 FEMA also announced that it would “immediately return[]” the IIJA funds to “the \nU.S. Treasury.” Id. \n219.  Defendants are thus refusing to make the funds available for BRIC grants as \nCongress required and are instead withholding the funds.  \n220.  By  doing  so,  Defendants  have  violated  the  Separation  of  Powers,  the \nAppropriations Clause, and the Spending Clause. \n221.  Defendants’ withholding of these funds injures Plaintiff States because it deprives \neach state of the minimum amount of funding to which that state is entitled each fiscal year, 42 \nU.S.C. § 5133(f)(2)(A), and it deprives States of the opportunity to compete for the remaining \nfunding. See W. Va. Ass’n of Cmty. Health Ctrs., Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C. Cir. \n1984) (“[A]ppellants have standing to seek relief that would allow them to compete for additional \nfunding.”). \n222.  All Plaintiff States have applied for, and received, BRIC grants in the past, and all \nintend to apply in the future. Some Plaintiff States, including Washington, applied for Fiscal Year \n2024 BRIC grants by the deadline notwithstanding Defendants’ unlawful termination of the \nprogram and withholding of Congressionally appropriated funds, while other Plaintiff States chose \nnot to apply in light of FEMA’s unequivocal statement that “no applications submitted will be \nreviewed and no funds will be awarded.”48 Regardless, all Plaintiff States stand ready to apply \npromptly should the program be reinstated. \n \n47FEMA Advisory, Update on FEMA Ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities \nProgram (Apr. 16, 2025), https://www.floods.org/wp-content/uploads/FEMA-Advisory-Update-on-FEMA-Ending-\nthe-Building-Resilient-Infrastructure-and-Communities-Program-April-16-2025.pdf. \n \n48 FEMA Advisory, Update on FEMA Ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities \nProgram (Apr. 16, 2025), https://www.floods.org/wp-content/uploads/FEMA-Advisory-Update-on-FEMA-Ending-\nthe-Building-Resilient-Infrastructure-and-Communities-Program-April-16-2025.pdf. \n \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 57 of 68\n223.

SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Appointments Clause \n(Termination of BRIC Program – No Authority to Act as Administrator) \n \n237.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n238.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27. \n239.  The Appointments Clause provides that “Officers of the United States” must be \nnominated by the President “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate” unless the officer \nis an “inferior Officer” and Congress “by Law” vests the appointment of that officer “in the \nPresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” U.S. Const., Art. II, § 2, \ncl. 2. \n240.  The  FEMA  Administrator  is  an  Officer  of  the  United  States  because  the \nAdministrator exercises significant authority on behalf of the United States, and his or her duties \non behalf of the United States are ongoing, and not occasional or temporary. The Administrator is \nresponsible for “lead[ing] the Nation’s efforts to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover \nfrom, and mitigate against the risk of natural disasters.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(2)(A). And in doing so, \nthe Administrator oversees a multi-billion dollar annual budget, and a workforce of thousands.51 \n241.  Congress has not vested the President alone, the Courts of Law, or the Head of a \nDepartment with authority to appoint the FEMA Administrator.  \n242.  In fact, Congress has confirmed that the FEMA “Administrator shall be appointed \nby the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.” 6 U.S.C. § 313(c)(1). \n \n51 Dep’t Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency: FEMA Budget Overview.

Congress provided that when a Presidentially-nominated and Senate-confirmed \nofficer resigns, the “first assistant to the office” automatically becomes the acting officer unless \nthe President directs either another Presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed person to \ntemporarily fill the role or appoints a senior officer or employee of the agency who was in that \nposition for at least “90 days” in “the 365-day period preceding the date of” the resignation. 5 \nU.S.C. § 3345(a). \n246.  Hamilton did not satisfy any of the criteria under the FVRA, such as being the “first \nassistant to the office” or being a senior officer or employee of the agency for at least 90 days \nbefore the position of FEMA Administrator became vacant. See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a). \n247.  Because  Hamilton  was  not  lawfully  appointed  as  FEMA  Administrator  nor \nauthorized to act as Administrator under the FVRA, he was acting without authority when he \nterminated the BRIC program, and his memo directing the termination of the BRIC program and \nhis efforts to implement that termination were void ab initio and should be vacated and set aside. \nNoel Canning v. N.L.R.B., 705 F.3d 490, 493 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (holding that actions taken by \nunlawfully appointed NLRB board members were “void ab initio” and vacating challenged order), \naff’d 573 U.S. 513 (2014); see also Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 251 (2018). \n60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 61 of 68\n248.  David Richardson, who is currently acting as FEMA Administrator, also was not \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate and also does not satisfy the requirements \nof the FVRA, so he, too, is serving unlawfully and thus cannot ratify Hamilton’s termination of \nthe BRIC program and lacks authority to implement that termination. \n249.  The Court should vacate and set aside Hamilton and Richardson’s termination of \nthe BRIC program, and implementation of the termination, and declare these actions void ab initio. \nXII.  EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAdministrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Contrary to Law, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C) \n(Termination of BRIC Program – No Authority to Act as Administrator) \n \n250.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n251.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might have \ncarried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” Loper Bright, 603 \nU.S. at 391. The APA thus provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is contrary to law. 5 U.S. C. § 706(2)(A)–(C). \n252.  Defendants are agencies under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1). \n253.  Defendants  took  final  agency  action  when  Defendants  terminated  the  BRIC \nprogram and implemented the termination. \n254.  For the reasons explained above, Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program \nwas contrary to law because Hamilton and Richardson were not lawfully appointed to serve as \nFEMA Administrator and thus were without lawful authority to act as FEMA’s Administrator \nwhen they ordered and implemented the BRIC termination. \n255.  The Court should therefore set aside this unlawful agency action. \n61 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 62 of 68\nXIII.  NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nEquitable Ultra Vires \n(BRIC Termination, Withholding Appropriated Funds, Repurposing BRIC Funds) \n \n256.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully \nset forth herein. \n257.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto . . . violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27. \n258.  When agencies “act improperly” or “beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra \nvires.” City of Arlington, 569 U.S. at 297. \n259.  No Constitutional provision authorizes Defendants to unilaterally terminate the \nBRIC program. \n260.  No statute authorizes Defendants to unilaterally terminate the BRIC program.  \n261.  As  described  above,  multiple  Constitutional  and  statutory  provisions  bar \nDefendants from unilaterally terminating the BRIC program. \n262.  Therefore, Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program is ultra vires. \n263.  No  Constitutional  provision  authorizes  Defendants  to  refuse  to  spend \nCongressionally appropriated funds.  \n264.  No statute authorizes Defendants to refuse to spend Congressionally appropriated \nfunds.  \n265.  Therefore, Defendants’ refusal to spend funds Congress appropriated for the BRIC \nprogram is ultra vires. \n266.  No Constitutional provision authorizes Defendants to use funds set aside for the \nBRIC program for other purposes. \n62 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 63 of 68\n267.  No statute authorizes Defendants to use funds set aside for the BRIC program for \nother purposes. \n268.  Therefore, Defendants’ redirecting of funds set aside for the BRIC program for \nother purposes is ultra vires. \n269.  Cameron Hamilton and David Richardson were both appointed to act as FEMA \nAdministrator unlawfully, and thus lacked authority to act as FEMA Administrator and their \ntermination of the BRIC program and implementation of that termination were ultra vires. \nXIV.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court: \na.  Declare unlawful Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program, withholding of \nCongressionally appropriated funds, and redirecting funds set aside for the BRIC program to other \nagency initiatives. \nb.  Declare that Cameron Hamilton was acting as FEMA Administrator unlawfully \nwhen he terminated and implemented the termination of the BRIC program, and that such \ntermination and implementation of the termination were void ab initio. \nc.  Declare that David Richardson is acting as FEMA Administrator unlawfully and \nhas no legal authority to ratify or implement the termination of the BRIC program. \nd.  Vacate and set aside Defendants’ termination of the BRIC program, withholding of \nCongressionally appropriated funds, and redirecting funds set aside for the BRIC program to other \nagency initiatives.  \ne.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  Defendants’  termination  of  the  BRIC \nprogram, and any action to implement that termination, and restore the status quo as it existed \n63 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 64 of 68\nbefore the termination, including by requiring Defendants to reopen the fiscal year 2024 Notice of \nFunding Opportunity, evaluate applications, and select recipients in a reasonable time period. \nf.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from withholding funds Congress \nhas appropriated for pre-disaster mitigation. \ng.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  Defendants  from  obligating,  using, \nexpending, or otherwise placing beyond the Court’s jurisdiction the court funds set aside for the \nBRIC program except for purposes of the BRIC program.  \nh.  Preliminarily enjoin Defendants from obligating, using, expending, or otherwise \nplacing outside the jurisdiction of the court funds Congress appropriated for pre-disaster mitigation \nprograms (including Congressionally directed spending toward particular projects) for programs \nother than the pre-disaster mitigation program.  \ni.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the time-limited expiration of any of the \nfunds appropriated for pre-disaster mitigation to preserve the Court’s jurisdiction and to account \nfor any time during which FEMA was not fully and actively administering the program, which \nPlaintiffs anticipate will be the amount of time between April 2, 2025 and final judgment.  \nj.  Enjoin defendants from enforcing the period of performance for each BRIC grant \nand the time under 42 U.S.C. § 5133(f)(3) for any period of time during which FEMA was not \nfully and actively administering the program, which Plaintiffs anticipate will be the amount of time \nbetween April 2, 2025 and final judgment.  \nk.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from implementing the Hamilton Memo and the \nBRIC termination. \nl.  Award Plaintiff States their costs and reasonable attorney’s fees; and \nm.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \n64 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12006     Document 1     Filed 07/16/25     Page 65 of 68\nDATED this 16th day of July 2025. \n \nANDREA JOY CAMPBELL  NICHOLAS W.
