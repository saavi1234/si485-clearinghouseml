    "summary": "<p>This matter involved United States investigations of Columbia University for alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\r\n<p>On March 3, 2025, the Trump Administration Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Education, and US General Services Administration, as part of the Federal Government's Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, announced they would conduct a comprehensive review of Columbia University's federal contracts and grants in conjunction with the Title VI investigation. On March 7, 10, and 14, 2025, the US terminated grants awarded to Columbia due what is characterized as to Columbia's failure to address harassment of Jewish students. HHS announced on May 22, 2025 that Columbia had violated Title VI by \"acting with deliberate indifference towards student-on-student harassment of Jewish students from October 7, 2023, through the present.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The US and Columbia reached a settlement agreement on July 23, 2025 where Columbia agreed to pay the US $220 million over three years; conduct a review of regional studies programs across the University, starting with the Middle East; appoint new faculty members with joint positions in both the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and the departments or fields of economics, political science, or SIPA; hire an administrator in the University Life office to serve as a liaison for antisemitism issues; and commit to merit-based practices in both hiring and admissions. In return, the US agreed to promptly payout both terminated and non-terminated grants and to close investigations related to Columbia's compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.&nbsp;</p>",
