    "summary": "<p>This case challenges the federal government&rsquo;s plan to destroy Ch&iacute;&rsquo;chil Biłda-goteel, or Oak Flat, a long-recognized Native American sacred site. Oak Flat is a centuries-old place of worship for the Western Apache tribe; it is a &ldquo;direct corridor to the Creator and the locus of sacred rituals that are uniquely tied to that place and cannot be replicated elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Since the mid-1900s, the federal government has recognized the significance of Oak Flat and has preserved it from mining activities to protect the Apache rituals that occurred there. That changed when a large copper deposit was discovered underneath Oak Flat, and the government, in 2014, transferred the site to Resolution Copper, a foreign-owned mining company, who will create a mine and destroy the site.</p>\r\n<p>On July 24, 2025, several Apache women and girls who worshipped at Oak Flat filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States of America; the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its Secretary; and the U.S. Forest Service and its Chief. They challenged the Government's plan to destroy Oak Flat, in violation of federal statutes and the Constitution. They alleged that Defendants' actions violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The day the case was filed, Resolution Copper filed a motion to intervene in the litigation, which was granted by the court on August 1 because they have &ldquo;a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The case was originally assigned to District Judge Timothy James Kelly in the District Court for the District of Columbia, but was transferred to District Judge Dominic William Lanza in the District of Arizona on August 1, 2025. 2025 WL 2193001. The case was transferred upon a Defendants&rsquo; and Intervenor-Defendant&rsquo;s motion to transfer venue because three other cases also challenging the transfer of Oak Flat to Resolution Copper were brought in the District of Arizona in January 2021 and were being litigated there. Judge Kelly also noted that Plaintiffs&rsquo; decision to file in the District Court for the District of Columbia &ldquo;raises the specter of forum-shopping&rdquo; because the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s decision in Apache Stronghold &ldquo;would appear to doom many of their First Amendment and RFRA claims.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the federal government from carrying out its plan to transfer Oak Flat to Resolution Copper for the mining project that would destroy the sacred site on August 19, 2025. In the alternative, if the motion for preliminary injunction were to be denied, Plaintiffs requested an injunction pending appeal on August 15 via an emergency motion.</p>\r\n<p>The court denied both motions on August 17. 2025 WL 2380475. The court found the RFRA and Free Exercise claims were foreclosed by binding Ninth Circuit precedent established in Apache Stronghold, and the NEPA claims, including the page-limit challenge, were unlikely to succeed because Plaintiffs could not demonstrate that they were injured or that NEPA&rsquo;s goals were materially impeded. Furthermore, the alternative request for an injunction pending appeal was denied for the same reasons, as the court requires a stronger showing on the merits to grant such relief.</p>\r\n<p>The same day, Plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal in the Ninth Circuit. Briefing is ongoing, and oral argument is scheduled for January 7, 2026. Several amici briefs have been filed for both sides.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In a related case&mdash;Arizona Mining Reform Coalition v. U.S. Forest Service&mdash;the Ninth Circuit granted a temporary administrative injunction on August 18 to preserve the status quo and enjoined from conveying Oak Flat for the fiscal year, until the court has time to reach the merits of the dispute.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case centers on the federal government’s plan to transfer Oak Flat (Chí’chil Biłda-goteel), a sacred religious site for the Western Apache tribe, to Resolution Copper for mining, which would destroy the site. Oak Flat has historically been protected due to its spiritual significance, but a 2014 transfer to Resolution Copper, after the discovery of a valuable copper deposit, reversed this protection. \r\n\r\nOn July 24, 2025, several Apache women and girls filed suit in Washington, D.C., alleging violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the First Amendment, NEPA, NHPA, and the APA. Resolution Copper was allowed to intervene, and the venue was moved to Arizona due to related litigation and concerns about forum-shopping. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to stop the transfer and destruction; both this and an emergency injunction pending appeal were denied, with the court citing binding precedent and a lack of injury under NEPA. \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit, where oral argument is set for January 2026, and multiple amici briefs have been filed. Meanwhile, a related Ninth Circuit case has temporarily blocked the transfer for the current fiscal year. The litigation is ongoing.",

Oak Flat is the Apaches’ direct corridor to the Creator and the \nsite of sacred rituals that are uniquely tied to that place and cannot be replicated elsewhere. The \nfederal government has long recognized the significance of Oak Flat and protected Apache rituals \nthere—reserving Oak Flat from mining and placing it in the National Register of Historic Places. \nYet in just 25 days (August 19, 2025), the government plans to transfer Oak Flat to a foreign-\nowned copper mining company for the sole purpose of constructing a mine that will physically \ndestroy the site, swallowing it in a massive crater and ending Apache religious practices forever.  \nThe government admits that the mine will destroy Oak Flat: the destruction will be “immediate, \npermanent, and large in scale”; all “public access” to the site will be “lost”; and nothing can “re-\nplace or replicate the tribal resources and [traditional cultural properties] that would be destroyed.” \nUSDA, 3 Final Environmental Impact Statement: Resolution Copper Project & Land Exchange \n892 (June 2025) (i.e., 3-EIS-892), https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/documents/final-eis; 1-EIS-\n153, 327. The government also admits that the copper could be mined using “alternative under-\nground mining methods” that would not crater Oak Flat’s surface; but the government declined to \nrequire these alternatives, or even consider them, on the ground that using them would “reduce the \namount of ore that could be profitably mined.” 4-EIS-F-3, F-4. In other words, the government has \nauthorized the complete physical destruction of an irreplaceable Native American sacred site \nsolely to increase the profits of a foreign-owned mining company. \nThis wanton, intentional, and needless destruction of Oak Flat violates multiple federal laws \nand the U.S. Constitution.  \nFirst, it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). RFRA provides that the fed-\neral government may not “substantially burden” a person’s religious exercise unless the govern-\nment demonstrates that imposing that burden is “the least restrictive means of furthering” a “com-\npelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). By its terms, RFRA applies to “all Fed-\neral law,” id. § 2000bb-3(a), including laws disposing of federal real property, and it expressly \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 11 of 54\ndefines the “exercise of religion” to include “[t]he use … of real property for the purpose of reli-\ngious exercise,” id. § 2000bb-2, 2000cc-5(7)(B). Thus, six federal appellate judges and two Su-\npreme Court Justices have already opined that destroying Oak Flat would substantially burden \nWestern Apaches’ religious exercise. See Apache Stronghold v. United States, 145 S. Ct. 1480, \n1480 (2025) (Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (“Gorsuch & \nThomas”) (citing Apache Stronghold v. United States, 101 F.4th 1036, 1131 (9th Cir. 2024) (en \nbanc) (Murguia, C.J., dissenting)); Apache Stronghold v. United States, No. 21-15295, 2021 WL \n12295173 (9th Cir. Mar. 5, 2021) (Bumatay, J., dissenting). And the government has never even \nattempted to show that destroying Oak Flat is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling \ngovernmental interest. Nor can it. Thus, the government’s actions violate RFRA. \nSecond, the destruction of Oak Flat violates the First Amendment right of Apache parents to \ndirect the religious upbringing of their children. In Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Supreme Court held \nthat “the right of parents ‘to direct the religious upbringing of their’ children would be an empty \npromise if it did not follow those children” onto government property. 145 S. Ct. 2332, 2351 \n(2025). Accordingly, the Court held that reading LGBTQ-inclusive storybooks to children in pub-\nlic schools, without notifying parents or allowing the children to opt out, posed a “‘very real threat \nof undermining’ the religious beliefs that the parents wish to instill in their children,” even though \nthe government’s actions were “subtle.” Id. at 2355. Here, there is nothing “subtle” about it: the \ngovernment is destroying a sacred site that is uniquely irreplaceable and necessary to the Apache \nfaith, without which Apache parents can never initiate their children in Apache religious ways. \nThus, the destruction of Oak Flat is nothing less than “the destruction of [a religious] commu-\nnity”—which all nine Justices in Mahmoud agreed was plainly unconstitutional. Id. at 2392 & n.8 \n(Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  \nThird, the destruction of Oak Flat violates the Free Exercise Clause because the government’s \nactions are neither neutral toward religion nor based on a generally applicable law. Far from being \nthe unanticipated, incidental effect of a religion-blind law, the government has made a calculated, \ndiscretionary, and individualized decision about a single piece of land—intentionally favoring the \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 12 of 54\nsecular use of copper mining over religious use by Apaches. That sort of discretionary decision to \nfavor secular conduct over religious conduct triggers strict scrutiny, which the government cannot \nsatisfy. \nFourth, the government’s EIS violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). A 2023 \namendment to NEPA provides that an EIS “shall not exceed 150 pages,” except for projects of \n“extraordinary complexity,” in which case an EIS “shall not exceed 300 pages.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 4336a(e)(1). Here, the EIS is over 1,000 pages—plainly violating the statute. Even then, the EIS \nis also woefully underinclusive. While providing many pages of useless information, the EIS fails \nat the most basic task of considering reasonable alternatives to the proposed agency action, includ-\ning admittedly feasible alternative mining methods that would be far less destructive of Oak Flat. \n42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(iii), (F). \nFifth, the transfer of Oak Flat violates the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The \nNHPA requires the government to identify historical sites that may be harmed by federal projects, \nand to mitigate and avoid harm to those sites. 54 U.S.C. § 306108; 36 C.F.R. § 800.1(a). Oak Flat \nis unquestionably a site of immeasurable historical value, as evidenced by (inter alia) its listing in \nthe National Register of Historic Places. Yet the government has failed to follow the processes set \nout in the NHPA. It has pushed the transfer forward over the opposition of the NHPA-created \nAdvisory Council on Historical Preservation (ACHP) and has ignored the alternative approaches \nsuggested by the ACHP that would prevent subsidence and mitigate harm to the historical sites \nthat will be destroyed by the mine. This disregard of the ACHP and its proposed mitigation violates \nthe NHPA.  \n* * * \nThis nation has a tragic history of destroying Apache lives and land for the sake of mining \ninterests. That history should not be repeated here. Multiple federal laws protect Apache religious \npractices at Oak Flat. The Court should enforce those laws and enjoin the transfer and destruction \nof Oak Flat.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 13 of 54\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Oak Flat \nFor centuries, Western Apaches and other tribes have worshipped at a sacred site called \nChí’chil Biłdagoteel (“a broad flat of Emory oak trees”) or Oak Flat. See generally, Coleman Decl. \nEx. 1, Chí’chil Biłdagoteel Historic District, Traditional Cultural Property, National Register of \nHistoric Places Registration Form, NPS Form 10-900 at 4, 8, 14–22, 25–32, National Park Service \n(Jan. 2016), https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/references/nez-2016.pdf (“NPS”) \n(redactions in original). \nOak Flat is located within the Tonto National Forest about three miles east of present-day \nSuperior, Arizona, between Apache Leap on the west and Ga’an Canyon (or Devil’s Canyon) on \nthe east. Id. at 42. Its terrain is characterized by old-growth oak groves, grassy basins, boulder \nfields, jagged cliffs, and rare perennial waters used by songbirds, mountain lions, foxes, bears, \ncoatimundi, and deer. Id. at 5. Oak Flat “is particularly rich in traditional Apache resources, provid-\ning everything necessary for Apache survival.” Id. at 28. This includes “hundreds of traditional \nApache plants,” abundant acorns (“the single most important traditional food today”), “rare holy \nmedicines,” and animals and minerals “that are crucial to Apache religion and culture.” Id. In part \nbecause of this natural abundance, Oak Flat also features a singular concentration of “Apache \n[archaeological] sites located in one small area”—demonstrating that Oak Flat “has been persis-\ntently utilized and occupied for the past 1,500 years.” Id. at 14–16. \nAs part of the Western Apache ancestral homeland, Oak Flat figures prominently in Apache \nhistory and cosmology. Id. at 8. It is often described as “the birthplace of [Western Apache] reli-\ngion” or an Apache’s “spiritual” or “religious home.” Declaration of Sinetta Lopez ¶¶ 6, 17, 20 \n(“Sinetta”); Declaration of Nomie Brown ¶¶ 2, 9 (“Nomie”); Declaration of Gouyen Brown Lopez \n¶ 26 (“Gouyen”); Declaration of Angela Kinsey ¶¶ 6, 8 (“Angela”). It is a dwelling place of pow-\nerful spiritual beings called Ga’an, who are holy spirits or messengers between the Creator and \nhumans (Sinetta ¶ 20)—sometimes compared  to angels in the Judeo-Christian tradition, but \n“bound up with a specific place” and unable “to exist without it.” Tisa Wenger, Fighting for Oak \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 14 of 54\nFlat: Western Apaches and American Religious Freedom, 39 J.L. & Religion 247, 248, 267 (2024) \n(“Wenger”); NPS at 25. As the dwelling place of the Ga’an, Oak Flat is a unique “source of su-\npernatural power” (or diyih) and “the direct corridor to the Creator.” Nomie ¶ 17; NPS at 8, 27; \nsee also Angela ¶¶ 7–8; Gouyen ¶¶ 5, 23, 28; Sinetta ¶ 6. As such, Oak Flat is the site of essential \nreligious ceremonies that are tied to that place and cannot be replicated elsewhere. Wenger at 248 \n(Oak Flat is “the only place where certain prayers, offerings, and ceremonies can be conducted”).  \nOne ceremony that occurs at Oak Flat is called the Holy Ground Ceremony. This is a blessing \nceremony that a medicine man conducts for protection from sickness and perils. Id. at 259–60. It \nhas been performed in its current form at Oak Flat for at least 100 years, but it reflects and builds \non much older practices. Id. at 257–58. The current version of that ceremony dates back at least to \nthe 1920s and the Apache prophet Silas John, whose movement “very clearly included ceremonies \nat Chi’chil Biłdagoteel [Oak Flat].” Id. The federal government actively suppressed the Holy \nGround movement by forbidding Silas John’s dances and jailing him. Id. at 259. Nevertheless, \nApache families continued to hold Holy Ground Ceremonies at Oak Flat in the late 1940s or early \n1950s, and they still do today. Id. The ceremony takes place at Oak Flat because “[t]he presence \nof the Gáán … makes the plants, herbs, and medicines gathered at Chi’chil Biłdagoteel more potent \nfor both medicinal and ceremonial use.” Id. at 261; see also Sinetta ¶ 18 (healing from sacred \nspring waters at Oak Flat); Nomie ¶ 4 (healing from blessings and prayers said at Oak Flat).  \nThe Sunrise Ceremony is a rite of passage for Apache girls. Gouyen ¶ 7. This coming-of-age \nceremony takes months of planning, entails several days of celebration, and often unites families \nand clans from all four Western Apache reservations. Id. ¶ 7; NPS at 32. To prepare for her Sunrise \nCeremony, the girl moves onto Oak Flat and uses materials from Oak Flat to build a traditional \nApache house, called a wickiup, where she lives for the duration of the ceremony. Gouyen ¶ 9; \nNomie ¶ 6. She gathers the elements of the ceremony from the holy ground at Oak Flat, thanking \nMother Earth for her resources. Gouyen ¶ 22. The medicine man gives the girl traditional buckskin \nclothing and a cane he has prepared for her, and tribal members surround her with singing, dancing, \nand prayer. Gouyen ¶¶ 13–18. On the second night, the Ga’an arrive. Id. ¶ 19. Five girls dance \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 15 of 54\nbehind the Ga’an dancers, representing how the Ga’an are there to help and guide them through \nlife. Id. On the final day, the girl is painted with a special white paint made from the ground at Oak \nFlat; as she dances, she embodies the White Painted Woman, the matriarch of the Apache people \nwho came from the ground at Oak Flat. Gouyen ¶¶ 20–21. At the end of the ceremony, when the \ngirl’s godmother wipes the clay from her eyes, she is an Apache woman, forever connected with \nthe spirit of Oak Flat. Id. ¶ 23; Nomie ¶¶ 8, 15, 17. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 16 of 54\nOak Flat is also the site of several natural springs, which are rare in this arid region, and which \nare sources of spiritual power for Apaches. NPS at 5, 27; 1-EIS-16. One example is Tú Nahikaadi \n(Dripping Spring), a dripping spring within a cave, which has a unique role in Apache tradition. \nNPS at 32; Wenger at 250–51. According to Apache tradition, a great flood scoured the world, and \nthe matriarch of the Apache people, White Painted Woman or Changing Woman, survived the \nflood and took refuge in a cave with a dripping spring. Id.; Sinetta ¶ 20. She emerged alone into \nthis world, and her children, conceived with the Sun, received guidance from the Ga’an on how to \nlive in this land. Wenger at 250–51. Western Apaches continue to visit Dripping Spring for sacred \nrituals today, id. at 262–63, and the Apache girl in a Sunrise Dance embodies Changing Woman \nas she dances her way to womanhood, Gouyen ¶¶ 20, 22. \nOak Flat is also the site of Tséyaa Gogeschin (translated Written or Painted under the Rocks), \na large rock overhang with ancient pictographs and petroglyphs—rock art that holds special mean-\ning for Apache medicine people and provides an irreplaceable living connection to Apache ances-\ntors. NPS at 32; Sinetta ¶ 7. The Chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe has described this \nartwork as “the footprints and the very spirit of our ancestors, hallmarks akin to the art found in \ngothic cathedrals and temples, like the Western Wall in Jerusalem [or] St. Peter’s Basilica in Vat-\nican City … . This is why I call Oak Flat the Sistine Chapel of Apache religion.” 6-EIS-U-9. \nWhile marking off specific boundaries of a sacred place is in tension with Apache ways (NPS \nat 11), the following map identifies the area where the critical sites described above are located—\nincluding the sacred ceremonial grounds, oak groves, sacred springs, medicine-gathering areas, \nand ancient petroglyphs (see Sinetta ¶ 4): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 17 of 54\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB.  Plaintiffs’ religious practices \nThe Plaintiffs in this case are Apache women and girls whose religious practices center on Oak \nFlat and who would be unable to practice their religion if Oak Flat is destroyed.  \nPlaintiff Gouyen Brown had her Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat. Gouyen ¶¶ 6, 8–25. During \nthat ceremony, she experienced a profound spiritual connection with Mother Earth and with her \nancestors. Id. ¶ 23. It is where she became a new woman. Id. ¶ 24. She continues to return to Oak \nFlat to pray, gather medicine, and participate in religious ceremonies. Id. ¶ 26. She hopes and \nintends that her own future children will be able to connect with the Creator at Oak Flat, and that \nher daughters will be able to have their Sunrise Ceremonies at Oak Flat. Id. If Oak Flat is destroyed, \nshe would be devastated. She would be unable to continue core religious practices and unable to \nbring up her children in Apache religious ways. Id. ¶¶ 24, 27.  \nPlaintiff Sinetta Lopez is an Apache woman and Gouyen’s mother. She grew up coming to \nOak Flat with her mother and grandmother, collecting berries, praying, and participating in sacred \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 18 of 54\nceremonies there. Sinetta ¶¶ 3, 5. Oak Flat is central to her religious practices. As a single mother, \nOak Flat is essential to how she brings up her daughters in the Apache way. Id. ¶¶ 8–23.  \nSinetta also has a minor daughter, L.B. Sinetta’s minor daughter has grown up at Oak Flat and \nhas had dreams and encounters with spirits at Oak Flat and was healed of an illness by drinking \nwater from a sacred spring at Oak Flat. Id. ¶ 18. She is planning her Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat \nfor October and wants to remain connected with the Creator and with her ancestors through sacred \nceremonies at Oak Flat. Id. ¶ 19.  \nPlaintiff Nomie Brown is an Apache woman who had her coming-of-age Sunrise Ceremony at \nOak Flat. Nomie ¶ 5. That ceremony fundamentally changed her life, and she continues to return \nto Oak Flat to engage in prayer and religious ceremonies there today. Id. ¶¶ 8, 10. Oak Flat is \nessential to her ongoing religious exercise and her identity as an Apache woman.  \nPlaintiff Angela Kinsey is an Apache woman and mother who engages in religious practices \nat Oak Flat. Angela ¶¶ 2, 8. She grew up coming to Oak Flat with her grandmother and has partic-\nipated in many religious ceremonies at Oak Flat, including serving as a godmother in a Sunrise \nCeremony. Id. ¶¶ 5, 9. She has two minor daughters whom she continues to take to Oak Flat to \nshow them where they came from and to pass on Apache traditions and religious ways. Id. ¶¶ 10-\n16. Oak Flat is the place where she is uniquely able to connect with the Creator. Id. ¶ 17.  \nAngela’s older minor daughter, V.K., had her coming-of-age ceremony at Oak Flat. Id. ¶ 10. \nShe has attended many ceremonies at Oak Flat, and attending and participating in those ceremonies \nis an essential part of her religious practices and identity as an Apache woman. Id. ¶ 8.  \nAngela’s younger minor daughter, M.K., is four years old. Id. ¶ 10. Angela hopes and intends \nthat M.K. will be able to have her coming-of-age ceremony at Oak Flat. Id. ¶ 15. \nFor Plaintiffs, Oak Flat in its entirety is a sacred and holy site. Oak Flat’s protection is essential \nfor the continued practice of Apache religious and cultural ways, and they oppose the govern-\nment’s plan to violate the integrity of Oak Flat through mining—which would cut off Plaintiffs’ \naccess to Oak Flat and make it impossible for them to carry out essential religious practices.  \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 19 of 54\nC.  The taking of Oak Flat \nBefore the United States existed, Oak Flat was Apache land. John R.

Beginning in the 1500s, other nations made claims to the land, including Spain and, \nlater, Mexico. See Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1482. The United States first purported to \ngain an interest in the area in 1848, when Mexico—defeated in the Mexican-American War—\nceded its claim to the area in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Id. at 1482; 2-EIS-822.  \nIn 1852, the United States entered the Treaty of Santa Fe with several Apache chiefs. Treaty \nwith  the  Apaches  art.  8  (July  1,  1852),  10  Stat.  979,  980,  https://www.govinfo.gov/con-\ntent/pkg/STATUTE-10/pdf/STATUTE-10-Pg979.pdf#page=2. To secure peace with the Apaches, \nthe United States promised to “designate, settle, and adjust their territorial boundaries” and “pass \nand execute” laws “conducive to the prosperity and happiness of said Indians.” Id., art. 9. Although \nthe formal designation of boundaries never occurred, the earliest map of the area, prepared by the \nSmithsonian Institution in 1899, shows Oak Flat as Apache territory, not belonging to the United \nStates. Welch at 6. \nThe promised peace didn’t occur either. Shortly after the 1852 Treaty, settlers and miners en-\ntered the area over Apache opposition, and U.S. soldiers and civilians repeatedly massacred \nApaches. Welch at 7–8. In 1862, U.S. Army General James Carleton ordered Apache men to be \nkilled wherever found. When miners discovered gold and silver nearby, General Carleton ordered \nthe Apaches’ “removal to a Reservation” or “utter extermination” to protect “all those who go to \nthe country in search of precious metals.” Welch at 8. By 1874, the government had forced 4,000 \nApaches onto the San Carlos Reservation—nicknamed “Hell’s 40 Acres” because it was a barren \nwasteland.

The EIS admits that Oak Flat is “part of the \ntraditional territories of the Western Apache,” who “lived on and used the resources of these \nlands,” that the government took Oak Flat “by force 150 years ago,” and that because of the gov-\nernment’s actions, Western Apaches “lost large portions of their homelands, including Oak Flat, \nand today live on lands that do not encompass places sacred to their cultures.” 3-EIS-873–75. \nD.  Protections for Oak Flat \nBeginning in the 20th century, the government took steps to protect Oak Flat. In 1905, the \ngovernment created the Tonto National Forest, which includes Oak Flat. 2-EIS-823. In 1955, Pres-\nident Eisenhower reserved crucial portions of Oak Flat to protect it from mining. 20 Fed. Reg. \n7,319, 7,336–37 (Oct. 1, 1955). In 1971, President Nixon renewed the protection. 36 Fed. Reg. \n18,997, 19,029 (Sep. 25, 1971). And in 2016, the National Park Service placed Oak Flat in the \nNational Register of Historic Places, recognizing “that Chí’chil Biłdagoteel is an important feature \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 21 of 54\nof the Western Apache landscape as a sacred site, as a source of supernatural power, and as a staple \nin their traditional lifeway.” NPS at 8. \nE.  The land transfer \nThese protections came under pressure starting in 1995, when a large copper deposit was dis-\ncovered 4,500 to 7,000 feet beneath Oak Flat. 1-EIS-ES-1. In 2004, two large multinational mining \ncompanies, Rio Tinto and BHP, formed a joint venture called Resolution Copper and began lob-\nbying Congress to transfer Oak Flat so that Resolution could mine the deposit.

Rio \nTinto’s largest shareholder is Aluminum Corporation of China, a “state-owned enterprise” of the \nChinese government.1 And Rio has been widely condemned internationally for destroying indige-\nnous sacred sites—including intentionally destroying 46,000-year-old caves constituting one of \nAustralia’s most significant cultural sites.2 \nBetween 2005 and 2013, Congress considered at least twelve standalone bills to transfer Oak \nFlat to Resolution Copper.

Millet, supra. The \nland-transfer provision then passed as Section 3003 of the NDAA. \nSection 3003 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer title to approximately 2,422 \nacres of Forest Service lands, including Oak Flat, to Resolution, in exchange for other parcels of \nland owned by Resolution scattered elsewhere in Arizona. § 3003(b)(2), (b)(4), (c)(1), (d)(1), 128 \nStat. 3732–37. The land to be transferred to Resolution is shown here: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 3003 revokes the orders by Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon protecting Oak Flat. \n§ 3003(i)(1)(A), 128 Stat. 3740. Section 3003 also instructs that, before conveying the federal land, \nthe Secretary must “prepare a single environmental impact statement under the National Environ-\nmental Policy Act [NEPA] which shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law \nrelated to the proposed mine.” § 3003(c)(9)(B), 128 Stat. 3735–36. Section 3003 also requires the \nSecretary to “engage in government-to-government consultation with affected Indian tribes con-\ncerning issues of concern … related to the land exchange.” § 3003(c)(3)(A), 128 Stat. 3733. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 23 of 54\nFollowing that consultation, the Secretary must consult with Resolution “and seek to find mutually \nacceptable measures to (i) address the concerns of the affected Indian tribes; and (ii) minimize the \nadverse  effects  on  the  affected  Indian  tribes  resulting  from  mining  and  related  activities.” \n§ 3003(c)(3)(B), 128 Stat. 3733.  \nOnce the Secretary publishes a NEPA-compliant EIS, Section 3003 provides that “the Secre-\ntary shall convey all right, title, and interest of the United States” in Oak Flat “to Resolution Cop-\nper” within “60 days.” § 3003(c)(10), 128 Stat. 3736. \nF.  The mine \nThe government originally published an EIS on January 15, 2021. 1-EIS-ES-3. A few weeks \nlater, the government withdrew that EIS—stating that it needed additional “time” to “fully under-\nstand concerns raised by Tribes.” Id.; USDA, Forest Service, Resolution Copper Project & Land \nExchange Environmental Impact Statement: Project Update (Mar. 1, 2021), https://www.resolu-\ntionmineeis.us/. The government eventually republished the EIS on June 20, 2025. USDA,  Final \nEnvironmental Impact Statement: Resolution Copper Project & Land Exchange (June 2025). \nThe EIS confirms that the mine will destroy Oak Flat. See generally Table of Excerpts from \nthe 2025 EIS, infra p. 38. The copper is located between 4,500 and 7,000 feet below Oak Flat’s \nsurface. 1-EIS-ES-1. To mine it, Resolution will use a technique called panel caving, which in-\nvolves tunneling beneath the ore, fracturing it with explosives, and removing it from below. 1-\nEIS-13. Once the ore is removed, approximately 1.37 billion tons of toxic waste (“tailings”) will \nneed to be stored forever. 1-EIS-62. This will permanently bury or otherwise destroy many pre-\nhistoric and historic cultural artifacts, including human burials. 1-EIS-44. Oak Flat itself will col-\nlapse (“subside”) into a crater almost 2 miles across and 800 to 1,115 feet deep. 1-EIS-ES-4. The \nfollowing map shows the crater in relation to the ceremonial sites described above (cf. 1-EIS-65): \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 24 of 54\n  The EIS admits that the impacts of the mine will be “immediate, permanent, and large in scale” \nand that all “public access” to the site will be “lost.” 3-EIS-892; 1-EIS-327. Among other things, \nthe mine will destroy the places used for Sunrise, Holy Grounds, and other sacred ceremonies; old-\ngrowth oak groves and sacred medicinal plants; sacred springs, including Changing Woman \nSpring; burial grounds; and ancient religious and cultural artifacts, including the ancient petro-\nglyphs of Tséyaa Gogeschin. 1-EIS-ES-29, 1-EIS-44, 1-EIS-160; 6-EIS-U-3, 6-EIS-U-9–10. The \ndestruction of Oak Flat will terminate the Apaches’ access to the site, destroy the foods, medicines, \nsprings, artifacts and locations that are essential to their religious practices, and make it physically \nimpossible for the Apaches to ever engage in their core religious practices again. 1-EIS-160; 3-\nEIS-867–71; Gouyen ¶¶ 27–28; Sinetta ¶ 23; Nomie ¶¶ 16–17; Angela ¶ 17. \nG. The lawsuits  \nWhen the government initially published an EIS in 2021, three lawsuits challenged the ade-\nquacy of the EIS and the legality of the land transfer. Compl., Apache Stronghold v.

Two of those \nlawsuits focused on the adequacy of the 2021 EIS and were stayed when the EIS was withdrawn \non March 1, 2021. Order, San Carlos Apache Tribe v. U.S. Forest Serv., No. 2:21-cv-68 (D. Ariz. \nMar. 23, 2021), ECF No. 47; Order, Ariz. Mining Reform Coal. v. U.S. Forest Serv., No. 2:21-cv-\n122 (D. Ariz. Mar. 16, 2021), ECF No. 35. One of the lawsuits challenged the legality of the land \ntransfer under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and First Amendment and sought an emer-\ngency injunction. The district court declined to enjoin the transfer. Apache Stronghold, No. 2:21-\ncv-50, 2021 WL 689906 (D. Ariz. Feb. 22, 2021). The en banc Ninth Circuit affirmed by a 6-5 \nvote. Apache Stronghold, 101 F.4th 1036. And the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari on \nMay 27, 2025, over a dissenting opinion from Justices Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas. Gor-\nsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. 1480. Justices Gorsuch and Thomas explained that the Ninth Circuit’s \ndecision was “extraordinary,” “highly doubtful as a matter of law,” and turned on a rule that “[n]ot \na single other Court of Appeals has” adopted.” Id. at 1480, 1488.  \nA few weeks after the Supreme Court denied certiorari, the government on June 20, 2025, \nrepublished the EIS. It intends to transfer Oak Flat to Resolution on August 19, 2025.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA party moving for a preliminary injunction must show: (1) a likelihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) that it will likely suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief; (3) the balance of \nharms favors an injunction; and (4) the injunction will be in the public interest. League of Women \nVoters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016). “In First Amendment cases, the likelihood \nof success [on the merits] ‘will often be the determinative factor’ in the preliminary injunction \nanalysis.” Pursuing America’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits.  \nA.  The government’s actions violate RFRA. \nCongress enacted RFRA “in order to provide very broad protection for religious liberty.” Bur-\nwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 693 (2014); see Singh v. Berger, 56 F.4th 88, 92–\n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 26 of 54\n93 (D.C. Cir. 2022). Under RFRA, the federal “Government shall not substantially burden a per-\nson’s exercise of religion” unless it satisfies strict scrutiny. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a)–(b). RFRA \nsidesteps the rule developed in Employment Division v. Smith, which permits laws that are neutral \nand generally applicable to burden religious exercise—instead applying even if government action \nis “‘neutral’ toward religion” and “of general applicability.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb(a)(2), 2000bb-\n1(a). And RFRA is a “super statute,” Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 682 (2020), apply-\ning by its terms “to all Federal law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or oth-\nerwise.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(a); see Singh, 56 F.4th at 97–103 (applying RFRA to Marine \nCorps); Nat’l Capital Presbytery v. Mayorkas, 567 F. Supp. 3d 230, 240–46 (D.D.C. 2021) (ap-\nplying RFRA to immigration law). \nRFRA claims proceed in two steps. First, the plaintiff must show his “exercise of religion” has \nbeen “substantially burdened.” Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 \nU.S. 418, 430–31 (2006). Second, “the burden is placed squarely on the Government” to prove \nthat substantially burdening the plaintiff is “the least restrictive means” of furthering a “compelling \ngovernmental interest.” Id. at 418, 429–30.  \nHere, the government’s actions substantially burden Plaintiffs’ religious exercise by barring \naccess to and physically destroying the irreplaceable site at which Plaintiffs’ religious practices \nmust take place. And the government has not even attempted to satisfy strict scrutiny. Thus, Plain-\ntiffs are likely to prevail on their RFRA claim. \n1.  The government’s actions impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious \nexercise. \nRFRA, like its sister-statute RLUIPA, does not define the term “substantial burden,” so courts \n“turn to the phrase’s plain meaning.” Tanzin v. Tanvir, 592 U.S. 43, 48 (2020). The D.C. Circuit \nhas held that a “substantial burden” exists when government action exceeds a “de minimis burden \non religious practice” and “puts ‘substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to \nviolate his beliefs’” or “otherwise interfere[s] with” “religious act[s].” Kaemmerling v. Lappin, \n553 F.3d 669, 678, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2008). As this definition suggests, a burden does not have to be \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 27 of 54\n“complete, total, or insuperable” to count. Thai Meditation Ass’n of Ala. v. City of Mobile, 980 \nF.3d 821, 830 (11th Cir. 2020). But “government conduct” that does “completely prevent[]” the \nplaintiff’s religious exercise “clearly satisfies” it. Id. “As a matter of ordinary meaning, after all, \nan action that prevents a religious exercise does not just burden that exercise substantially, it bur-\ndens it completely.” Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1486. \nHere, the government is plainly “interfer[ing] with” “religious act[s]” in more than a “de min-\nimis” way. Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678, 679. Indeed, the government is “completely pre-\nvent[ing]” religious acts. Thai Meditation, 980 F.3d at 829. Plaintiffs perform specific religious \nacts that are uniquely tied to Oak Flat and cannot be replicated elsewhere. Gouyen ¶¶ 22-23; Si-\nnetta ¶¶ 22-23; Nomie ¶ 17; Angela ¶ 17. Yet “‘[i]t is undisputed’ that the government’s plan will \npermanently ‘destroy the Apaches’ historical place of worship, preventing them from ever again \nengaging in religious exercise’ at Oak Flat.” Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1480; see Gouyen \n¶¶ 26-28; Sinetta ¶ 23; Nomie ¶ 15. It is hard to imagine how a burden could be any more substan-\ntial. See Yellowbear v. Lampert, 741 F.3d 48, 55–56 (10th Cir. 2014) (Gorsuch, J.) (when govern-\nment “prevents the plaintiff from participating in a[] [religious] activity,” giving the plaintiff no \n“degree of choice in the matter,” the government action “easily” imposes a substantial burden \n(emphasis added)). In fact, “one court after another has held that preventing a religious exercise \nis, necessarily, a ‘substantial burden’ on that religious exercise.” Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. \nat 1488. \nAnd indeed, the Supreme Court itself has recognized that preventing religious exercise through \n“destruction of religious property” can constitute a “RFRA violation[].” Tanzin, 592 U.S. at 51 \n(emphasis added). Other courts, including the D.C. Circuit, have already applied this principle to \nuse of sacred sites on government-controlled land. \nIn Comanche Nation v. United States, for example, the Army planned to build a warehouse on \nfederal land near Medicine Bluffs, a sacred site. No. 08-cv-849, 2008 WL 4426621, at *17 (W.D. \nOkla. Sep. 23, 2008). But the warehouse would have occupied “the precise location” where Native \nAmericans  stood  for  worship  near  the  Bluffs—making  their  traditional  religious  practices \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 28 of 54\nimpossible. Id. at *7, *17. The court held that this physical interference with plaintiffs’ religious \nexercise “amply demonstrate[d]” a “substantial burden.” Id.  \nSimilarly, in the pre-RFRA Free Exercise Clause decision of Wilson v. Block, the D.C. Circuit \nconsidered whether the government had “burden[ed]” Native Americans “in the practice of their \nreligion[]” by permitting the expansion of a ski resort on the San Francisco Peaks. 708 F.2d 735, \n737–42 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The court held that “plaintiffs seeking to restrict government land use in \nthe name of religious freedom must, at a minimum, demonstrate that the government’s proposed \nland use would impair a religious practice that could not be performed at any other site.” Id. at \n744. But while the plaintiffs there held the Peaks “as a whole” “sacred,” the permit encompassed \nonly a “small portion of the Peaks”; thus, it did not impede the plaintiffs’ “free entry onto the \nPeaks,” and the plaintiffs had failed to show that the project would “prevent them from performing \nceremonies or collecting objects that can be performed or collected in the [ski area] but nowhere \nelse.” Id. \nThis case is like Comanche Nation and unlike Wilson. As the government here acknowledges, \nthe mine will obliterate “the precise location” where Plaintiffs hold sacred ceremonies at Oak Flat, \nleaving a nearly two-mile-wide, 1,100-foot-deep crater in its place. Comanche Nation, 2008 WL \n4426621, at *7, *17. That action will “den[y] the plaintiffs” and other Apaches “access to” Oak \nFlat, and it will permanently foreclose specific religious exercises that take place there “but no-\nwhere else.” Wilson, 708 F.2d at 744. As the EIS admits, this physical destruction of one-of-a-kind \n“[t]ribal sacred sites” will be “immediate,” “permanent,” and “[i]rreversible.” 2-EIS-836–37. \nThus, as six federal appellate judges and two Supreme Court Justices have already opined, the \nchallenged action here “does not just burden” Apache religious exercise at Oak Flat “substan-\ntially”—“it burdens it completely.” Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1486; see Apache Strong-\nhold, 101 F.4th at 1131 (Murguia, C.J., dissenting); Apache Stronghold, 2021 WL 12295173, at \n*2–3, *4 & n.4, *7 (Bumatay, J., dissenting). \nContrary to the en banc majority’s contention in Apache Stronghold, Lyng does not change this \nstraightforward analysis. Apache Stronghold, 101 F.4th at 1044. In Apache Stronghold, an en banc \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 29 of 54\npanel majority of the Ninth Circuit agreed that in general the government “substantially burden[s]” \nreligious exercise when it “prevent[s] access to” it. 101 F.4th at 1043. Nevertheless, a different \nmajority declined to apply RFRA’s plain meaning in favor of a novel theory that “substantial bur-\nden” has a special meaning that adopts an idiosyncratic interpretation of Lyng in just one context—\ncases involving federally managed land. Id. at 1044.  \nBut as Justices Gorsuch and Thomas rightly observed, this theory is “difficult to reconcile with \nthe statutory text,” “highly doubtful as a matter of law,” and “extraordinary” (not in a good way). \nGorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1486, 1480.  \nFirst, the Ninth Circuit’s theory is contrary to RFRA’s text. It is undisputed that the “ordinary \nmeaning” of “substantial burden” includes a government action “that prevents a religious exer-\ncise.” Id. at 1486. And “[e]xactly nothing in the phrase ‘substantial burden’—or anything else in \nRFRA’s text—hints that a different and more demanding standard applies when (and only when) \nthe ‘disposition’ of the government’s property is at issue.” Id. Indeed, just the opposite: RFRA \nexpressly “applies to all Federal law, and the implementation of that law”—with no exception for \ngovernment real property. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(a); Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1486. Even \nmore, RFRA expressly defines the “exercise of religion” to include “[t]he use … of real property” \nfor religious exercise. 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-2(4), 2000cc-5(7)(B); Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. \nat 1486. These provisions cannot be squared with a special carveout from RFRA for government \nproperty. \nSecond, the Supreme Court has “never held” that RFRA “should be construed to ‘subsum[e]’” \npre-RFRA cases (like Lyng). Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1486. Again, just the opposite: the \nCourt “emphatically rejected that notion” as “absurd” in Hobby Lobby, emphasizing that “by en-\nacting RFRA, Congress went far beyond what this Court ha[d] held [to be] constitutionally re-\nquired” in prior cases. Id. (quoting Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 706). Indeed, RFRA expressly re-\nstores “the compelling interest test as set forth” in two prior cases it cites by name (Sherbert and \nYoder)—showing Congress knows how to incorporate prior cases when it wants to. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000bb(b)(1). But RFRA does no such thing with Lyng. As this Court has emphasized: “RFRA \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 30 of 54\noffers the right to freely exercise religion even ‘greater protection’ than the Free Exercise Clause.” \nMayorkas, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 243. \nThird, Lyng is a particularly ill-suited guide to the meaning of “substantial burden.” As Justice \nGorsuch noted: “Just search Lyng for the phrase ‘substantial burden.’ You will not find it.” Gor-\nsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1487. That’s because Lyng isn’t a substantial-burden case at all; it’s \na case, like Employment Division v. Smith, involving a “neutral” and “generally applicable” law. \n494 U.S. 872, 881–85 (1990). And the Supreme Court has said just that. In Trinity Lutheran \nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, the Court explained that, “[i]n recent years,” the Court has \n“rejected free exercise challenges” where “the laws in question have been neutral and generally \napplicable”—and cited Lyng as the leading “example.” 582 U.S. 449, 460 (2017); see also Fulton \nv. City of Philadelphia, 593 U.S. 522, 536 (2021). Far from applying a “substantial burden” test, \nLyng said the burden was “incidental” and emphasized that the government’s actions did not “dis-\ncriminate against religions.” 485 U.S. 439, 450, 453 (1988). This is the classic language of the \nneutral-and-generally-applicable test adopted in Smith—the very test RFRA is designed to dis-\nplace. Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1487; see also 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb(a)(2), 2000bb-1(a) \n(RFRA applies even if government action is “‘neutral’ toward religion” and “of general applica-\nbility”). \nFinally, even if Lyng were relevant to RFRA, it is easily distinguishable from this case, because \nthe government in Lyng did not “destroy a religious site.” Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1487. \nLyng repeatedly emphasized that the road was “removed as far as possible from [religious] sites,” \nand “[n]o sites where specific rituals take place were to be disturbed.” 485 U.S. at 443, 454. Thus, \nthe plaintiffs weren’t restricted from “visiting” the area or continuing their religious practices; \nrather, they claimed the road would “create distractions” rendering their practices spiritually “in-\neffectual.” Id. at 448, 450, 452–53. This indicates that Lyng, to the extent it addressed the question \nof substantial burden at all (which it didn’t), offers a much narrower proposition not implicated \nhere: that plaintiffs can’t prove a substantial burden by alleging solely “subjective spiritual harm,” \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 31 of 54\nbut must also identify objective interference with specific religious acts. Apache Stronghold, 101 \nF.4th at 1147 (Murguia, C.J., dissenting). \nThis approach similarly comports with this Circuit’s substantial burden analysis in Kaemmer-\nling. See Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 S. Ct. at 1488 (Ninth Circuit’s decision “an outlier” and reflects \na rule adopted by “[n]ot a single other Court of Appeals”). In Kaemmerling, the Court considered \na prisoner’s objection to the government storing his DNA. 553 F.3d at 678. He did not object to \nthe collection of DNA, but to the government’s possession and storage of his genetic information. \nId. The D.C. Circuit found that he did not allege a substantial burden, because “[t]he government’s \nextraction, analysis, and storage of Kaemmerling’s DNA information does not call for Kaemmer-\nling to modify his religious behavior in any way—it involves no action or forbearance on his part, \nnor does it otherwise interfere with any religious act in which he engages.” Id. at 679. That per-\nfectly illustrates the kind of burden that is based on purely subjective spiritual harms rather than \nany objective interference with the plaintiff’s religious practices. Here, by contrast, the govern-\nment’s actions will directly interfere with specific Apache religious practices by swallowing their \ncentral place of worship in a crater, preventing their religious exercise altogether.  \n2.  The government’s actions fail strict scrutiny.  \nWith a substantial burden shown, the government’s actions are lawful only if the government \nshows they are “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and “the least restrictive \nmeans of furthering that … interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). This inquiry—“strict scrutiny”—\nis “exceptionally demanding.” Singh, 56 F.4th at 93. And it’s “an ‘affirmative defense’ for which \nthe Government bears the burden of persuasion.” Id.; see also O Centro, 546 U.S. at 431. \nStrikingly, in four years of litigation in Apache Stronghold, the government has never once \nattempted to prove up a strict-scrutiny defense. If it tries to do so here, Plaintiffs will at that time \nrespond and explain why it fails. See Mayorkas, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 245 (by failing to offer com-\npelling-interest argument, defendants “have conceded that argument, and they cannot meet their \nburden for that reason alone”). For present purposes, however, Plaintiffs note only that even as-\nsuming  the  government  could  show  that  obtaining  this  copper  furthered  a  compelling \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 32 of 54\ngovernmental interest—despite the availability of ample, reliable supplies of copper elsewhere—\nthe planned project wouldn’t be the “least restrictive means” of doing so. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-\n1(b).  \nIndeed, the EIS itself demonstrates as much. As the EIS concedes, “there are other under-\nground … techniques that could physically be applied to” the deposit that “could substantially re-\nduce impacts on surface resources.” 4-EIS-F-3–4. These methods are “technically” and “physically \nfeasible,” and the government “agree[d]” about their benefits: namely, “the lack of a subsidence \narea overhead on Oak Flat, and the ability to backfill tailings underground.” 4-EIS-F-5; 1-EIS-50. \nBut the government rejected any detailed consideration of these alternatives on the ground that \nthey “would result in higher per-ton mining costs” and thus “reduce the amount of ore that could \nbe profitably mined.” 1-EIS-50–51; 4-EIS-F-3–4. \nThis analysis turns RFRA’s least-restrictive means requirement on its head. That requirement \nmeans that “[i]f the Government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, ‘it must do \nso,’” Singh, 56 F.4th at 93 (quoting Fulton, 593 U.S. at 541)—not that doing so is optional if might \nmarginally affect the government’s interests (or a foreign mining company’s profits). See also \nHobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 730 (RFRA may “require the Government to expend additional funds \nto accommodate citizens’ religious beliefs”); Griffin v. Cnty. Sch. Bd. of Prince Edward Cnty., 377 \nU.S. 218, 233 (1964) (to prevent constitutional violations, government can be required “to levy \ntaxes to raise funds adequate to reopen, operate, and maintain” legally compliant school system).  \nIndeed, the government’s claim that the alternative mining methods here wouldn’t “typically” \nbe used on similar deposits misses the point. 4-EIS-F-5. This deposit is not “typical” precisely \nbecause it lies beneath an irreplaceable sacred site. The whole point of RFRA is to treat govern-\nment actions that burden religious exercise differently from those that don’t, giving religious ex-\nercise “very broad protection.” Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 685; see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a) \n(free exercise protected “even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability”). The gov-\nernment is doing the opposite here—rejecting less restrictive alternatives in favor of a more de-\nstructive one. Its actions violate RFRA. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 33 of 54\nB.  The government’s actions violate the Free Exercise Clause. \nRFRA aside, the government’s actions also trigger strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise \nClause, on two grounds. First, when the government imposes a free-exercise burden of a particular \n“character”—“substantially interfer[ing] with the religious development” of plaintiff “parents’ \nchildren”—“strict scrutiny is appropriate regardless of whether the law is neutral or generally ap-\nplicable.” Mahmoud, 145 S. Ct. at 2361. Second, even under Smith, the government’s actions here \n“do not meet the requirement of being neutral and generally applicable.” Fulton, 593 U.S. at 533.  \nThus, strict scrutiny applies, and the government cannot satisfy that test.  \n1.  The government’s actions trigger strict scrutiny by burdening Plaintiffs’ First \nAmendment right to direct the religious upbringing of their children.  \nIn Mahmoud, the Supreme Court held that “regardless” of Smith, government actions are sub-\nject to strict scrutiny when they “substantially interfer[e] with the religious development” of chil-\ndren. 145 S. Ct. at 2361 (quoting Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 218 (1972)). Mahmoud in-\nvolved parents of public-school children who requested to opt their children out of lessons involv-\ning “‘LGBTQ+-inclusive’ storybooks’” in an elementary school curriculum. Applying Yoder, the \nSupreme Court held that in a case where the burden the government has placed on religious exer-\ncise involves “the religious beliefs and practices that the parents wish to instill in their children,” \nthe usual Free Exercise question of whether the burden is applied pursuant to a neutral and gener-\nally applicable law “d[oes] not apply.” Id. Because the government’s actions imposed an “objec-\ntive danger,” or a “very real threat of undermining” the parents’ religious exercise, the Supreme \nCourt held that denying parents an opt-out from materials that contradicted the religious beliefs \nthey wished to pass on to their children burdened the parents’ religious exercise and must withstand \nstrict scrutiny. Id. at 2349, 2355.  \nThe relevant religious exercise here is the Plaintiff parents’ ability to raise their children in \naccordance with their Apache religious beliefs, which includes worship, prayer, and religious cer-\nemonies that take place at Oak Flat, and instructing their children on their spiritual connection to \nOak Flat. See supra pp. 8-9. Core to that religious exercise is the parents’ desire for their daughters \nto have a Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat to allow them to transition to womanhood in accordance \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 34 of 54\nwith their religious beliefs. Id. It did not matter in Mahmoud that the children were not “compelled \nto commit some specific practice forbidden by their religion.” Id. at 2352. The Court held instead \nthat the Free Exercise Clause provides “more than protection against compulsion or coercion to \nrenounce or abandon one’s religion.” Id. at 2357–58. Just so here—the government’s actions \nthreaten the “specific religious beliefs and practices” the plaintiffs assert. Id. at 2353. The govern-\nment’s action, transferring an Apache sacred site for the purpose of turning it into a crater, poses \nan “objective danger” that will not only “undermin[e]” Plaintiffs’ religious exercise, but will phys-\nically render it impossible forever. Id. at 2349, 2355. By preventing plaintiff parents and their \nchildren from conducting their sunrise ceremonies at Oak Flat, visiting sacred springs, gathering \nmedicine, and holding sacred rituals at Oak Flat, the land transfer will put a full stop to Plaintiffs’ \nability to bring their children up according to their Apache religious beliefs. \nIn Mahmoud, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the operation of public schools \nconstituted governmental “internal affairs” with “incidental interference” in religious exercise. Id. \nat 2356–57 (quoting Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986), and Lyng, 485 U.S. at 450). \nMahmoud rejected reliance on Lyng, reasoning that “[t]he government’s operation of the public \nschools is not a matter of ‘internal affairs’ akin to the administration of Social Security or the se-\nlection of ‘filing cabinets.’” Id. Here, as in Mahmoud, the transfer of government land to a private \nentity is not simply the government’s “internal affairs.” It is a “direct, coercive” taking of what \nwas once Apache land; it gives a private mining company the ability to exclude Plaintiffs and \ncharge them with trespassing if they re-enter the land; and far from having mere “incidental” ef-\nfects on religious exercise, its whole purpose is to undertake an action that will extinguish a time-\nhonored religious exercise. Id. Even the Mahmoud dissent agreed that a burden would exist if the \ngovernment’s actions “would ‘result in the destruction of [a religious] community as it exist[s] in \nthe United States.’” Id. at 2392 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). That is this case. If the “subtle” mes-\nsage of books in public school burdens religious exercise, then surely swallowing the birthplace \nof Western Apache religion in a crater and stopping Plaintiffs from ever worshipping there again \ndoes too. Id. at 2391.  \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 35 of 54\n2.  The government’s actions trigger strict scrutiny because they are neither neutral \nnor generally applicable.  \nEven aside from Mahmoud, under the Free Exercise Clause, government action burdening re-\nligion is shielded from strict scrutiny only if it constitutes a “valid and neutral law of general ap-\nplicability.” Smith, 494 U.S. at 879. Failing either the neutrality or general applicability require-\nment is sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny, see Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 508 \n(2022)—“the most demanding test known to constitutional law,” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 \nU.S. 507, 534 (1997). Here, the land-transfer statute is neither neutral nor generally applicable and \ntherefore triggers strict scrutiny.  \nFirst, the land-transfer statute is not a neutral and generally applicable law because it reflects \n“a value judgment in favor of secular motivations, but not religious motivations.” Fraternal Order \nof Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359, 366 (3d Cir. 1999) (Alito, J.). \nThis is not a case in which the government passed an “across-the-board” statute that has “merely \nthe incidental effect” of burdening religious exercise. Smith, 494 U.S. at 884, 878. Rather, the \ngovernment was aware that “Oak Flat has always been and continues to be a place of profound \nreligious … significance” where Apache “religious ceremonies” “continue to this day.” Resolution \nCopper: Hearing on H.R. 1904, The Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act of \n2011, and S. 409, The Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act of 2009, Before \nthe  S.  Comm.  on  Energy  &  Nat.  Res,  112th  Cong.  32,  81  (2012),  https://www.con-\ngress.gov/112/chrg/CHRG-112shrg75271/CHRG-112shrg75271.pdf. Yet the government passed \nthe land-transfer statute anyway, with the bill’s lead sponsor faulting the Apaches for “car[ing] \nmore about some issues than they do about the prospect of employment.” Id. at 4. That deliberate \nchoice to treat “secular activity”—Resolution’s copper mining—“more favorably than religious \nexercise”—by Apaches like Plaintiffs—is exactly the sort of value judgment that “trigger[s] strict \nscrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause.” Tandon v. Newsom, 593 U.S. 61, 62 (2021). \nSecond, the land-transfer statute is not neutral and generally applicable because it “targets” the \nsite of Apache worship, and only this land, “for distinctive treatment.” Church of Lukumi Babalu \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 36 of 54\nAye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 534, 536 (1993). As other courts have already explained, \ngovernment action is not “generally applicable” if its “entire purpose” is to regulate only a “par-\nticular property.” Roman Catholic Bishop v. City of Springfield, 724 F.3d 78, 98 (1st Cir. 2013); \nsee also Int’l Church of Foursquare Gospel v. City of San Leandro, 673 F.3d 1059, 1066 (9th Cir. \n2011) (“individualized” zoning decision not “generally applicable”). Cf. Minn. Star & Tribune Co. \nv. Minn. Comm’r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 581 (1983) (“special tax that applies only to certain \npublications” was not “generally applicable”). That perfectly describes this case: The transfer and \ndestruction of Oak Flat is not the result of a “generally applicable” law; it is the result of a one-\noff, individualized land-exchange rider addressing a single piece of land. See § 3003, 128 Stat. \n3292, 3732; cf. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n v. Peterson, 795 F.2d 688, 689–90 (9th Cir. \n1986), rev’d sub nom, Lyng, 485 U.S. 439 (challenged road proposed as part of general manage-\nment plan for “76,500 acre[]” unit of a national forest). Such a law may well be constitutional—\nbut if it burdens religious exercise, it is so only if it survives strict scrutiny. \nC.  The government’s actions violate NEPA.  \nNEPA requires the government to ensure its actions are consistent with the “broad national \ncommitment to protecting and promoting environmental quality.” Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989); see 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370. NEPA realizes these \n“sweeping policy goals” “through a set of ‘action-forcing’ procedures that require that agencies \ntake a ‘“hard look” at environmental consequences’” before engaging in certain projects. Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 350 (quoting Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 410 n.21 (1976)). \nThe mine here is such a project. In fact, the land-transfer statute on its face instructs the Forest \nService to “carry out the land exchange in accordance with the requirements of the National Envi-\nronmental Policy Act” by preparing a “single environmental impact statement.” § 3003(c)(9)(A) \n–(B), 128 Stat. 3735. By thus incorporating NEPA, Congress required the Forest Service to take a \nhard look at the land transfer’s environmental consequences and then show its work in a “reason-\nable and reasonably explained” EIS. Seven Cnty. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle County, 145 S. Ct. \n1497, 1511 (2025).  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 37 of 54\nHere, however, the EIS violates NEPA in two respects: (1) it exceeds NEPA’s clear length \nlimit; and (2) it fails to comply with NEPA’s requirement to consider reasonable alternatives. \n1.  The EIS violates NEPA’s length requirement. \n  Although an EIS must be sufficiently “detailed,” it also must not “go[] on endlessly.” Seven \nCnty., 145 S. Ct. at 1512 & n.3. In 2023, Congress took a significant step toward increasing public \naccess to the government’s environmental analyses—by imposing a default 150-page limit on no-\ntoriously “meander[ing]” EISs. Id. at 1512.3 Congress’s instruction could not be clearer: generally, \n“an environmental impact statement shall not exceed 150 pages, not including any citations or \nappendices”; for agency actions “of extraordinary complexity,” the limit can go up to “300 pages.” \n42 U.S.C. § 4336a(e)(1)(A)-(B). \nHere, although the EIS’ text and appendices together contain roughly 2,400 pages, the Forest \nService has categorized only 1,010 pages as substantive text. But even that is more than six times \nthe default limit, and more than 700 pages longer than even the “extraordinary complexity” limit. \nNo matter how one slices it, the EIS blatantly exceeds NEPA’s page limit. That is “agency ac-\ntion[] … not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). And it’s little surprise why the gov-\nernment might choose to spill a sea of ink here—making it exceedingly difficult for the public, \nincluding Plaintiffs, to assess its compliance with NEPA while the 60-day clock ticks ever closer \nto the destruction of their sacred site. See Seven Cnty., 145 S. Ct. at 1512 n.3 (page limit “strongly \nreinforces [NEPA’s] basic principles”). \n2. The EIS fails to consider reasonable alternatives. \nThat said, just as “[b]revity should not be mistaken for lack of detail,” Id. at 1512, verbosity \nshould not be mistaken for analytical sufficiency. And here, the government neglected to “study, \ndevelop, and describe [in the EIS]” the “technically and economically feasible” alternatives to \nturning Oak Flat into a crater. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(F); see also id. § 4332(c)(iii) (requiring a “detailed \nstatement” on “a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed agency action, including an \n \n3   The EIS in Seven County was published two years before NEPA was amended to add a length \nlimitation, so the requirement did not impact that case. 145 S. Ct. at 1512 n.3.  \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 38 of 54\nanalysis of any negative environmental impacts of not implementing the proposed agency action \nin the case of a no action alternative, that are technically and economically feasible, and meet the \npurpose and need of the proposal”). Despite purporting to consider alternative mining methods in \nVolumes 4 (Appendix F) and 6 (Appendix R), the EIS admitted to “eliminat[ing]” “alternative \nmining techniques” “from detailed analysis.” 4-EIS-F-5. The Forest Service thus admittedly failed \nto give viable, publicly proposed alternatives the “hard look” NEPA requires, Robertson, 490 U.S. \nat 350, violating NEPA in at least three additional ways. \nFirst, the government rejects the viability of alternative mining methods such as “underground \nstoping” or “cut-and-fill” on the grounds that “almost no alternative techniques … were identified \nas reasonable for an ore deposit with the characteristics of the Resolution deposit,” 6-EIS-R-175, \n180 (emphasis added), and “very few of these underground stoping methods have characteristics \nthat are well suited to the Resolution copper deposit,” 4-EIS-F-3 (emphases added). But these \nconcessions raise more questions than they answer. For example, which of these alternative meth-\nods are “reasonable” and “well suited” to the deposit? and (2) if even a single method is “reason-\nable” and “well suited,” why is it not being actively considered? But the government’s implicit \nanswer—a chart suggesting that all of the methods are inadequate, 4-EIS-F-3, 4—cannot be \nsquared with the EIS’s concession that there are “reasonable” and “well suited” alternatives that \n“technically … could be used.” Id. \nSecond, the EIS claims the alternative mining alternatives are unreasonable because the pro-\nposed panel caving is a “standard mining method” “commonly used” to mine similar deposits and \nis thus the “appropriate method to be applied” to the Resolution Copper mine. 4-EIS-F-5. But this \nis merely an affirmative statement in support of the government’s preferred, destructive method; \nit offers no reason for disqualifying the proposed alternative mining methods. Simply being “stand-\nard” or “common” does not make an option the only reasonable one. To the contrary, the facts of \nthe case suggest that this deposit is a uniquely non-standard site with uncommon conditions—\nnamely an exceptionally deep deposit beneath a major sacred site at risk of destruction. 1-EIS-3–\n4.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 39 of 54\nThird, the government’s sweeping justification that no alternative mining method would be \neconomically feasible is deficient. It relies upon a single datapoint: a financial figure, pulled with-\nout scrutiny from Resolution data, suggesting that alternative methods would “result in higher per-\nton mining costs” and remove an “estimated 80 percent of the tonnage of the deposit from consid-\neration.” 4-EIS-F-5. And it treats profit as king—improperly dismissing the less-destructive alter-\nnative mining methods because they might “present[] only a partial solution to the stated purpose \nand need for the project.” City of Alexandria v. Slater, 46 F. Supp. 2d 35, 42 (D.D.C. 1999). \nNamely, they might save the site from complete physical destruction but hurt Resolution’s bottom \nline.4 Even if Resolution’s motives were unimpeachable, this would be an improper reason for the \ngovernment to “eliminate an otherwise reasonable alternative.” Id.  \nThe EIS is also far from transparent about its rationale. After stating that alternative mining \nmethods are economically infeasible, the EIS also states that the government “did not factor prof-\nitability into the analysis.” 4-EIS-F-5. This explanation is not only nonsensical—for if Resolu-\ntion’s profits increase, its ability to pay for the mine increases too—but contradicted by the EIS \nitself. The reasoning provided considers the per-ton mining costs and their effects on company \nprofits for their determination, 4-EIS-F-5—as it must. And it operates on the “basic assumption” \nthat “using a technique with higher per-ton mining costs requires a higher ore grade”—when using \na higher-grade ore could only be justified by securing profits. The government’s covert prioritiza-\ntion of Resolution’s financial interests only compounds its violations of NEPA. \nD.  The government’s actions violate the NHPA. \nThe NHPA requires that the federal government “take into account the effect of” any govern-\nment “undertaking on any historic property” and “afford the [Advisory Council on Historic Preser-\nvation (ACHP)] a reasonable opportunity to comment.” 54 U.S.C. § 306108. This process, called \nthe  Section  106  process,  seeks  to  “identify  historic  properties  potentially  affected  by  the \n \n4   Even providing for the estimated lower production levels suggested by the EIS, Resolution \nwould still be able to mine and arguably produce tens of billions of dollars’ worth of copper, meet-\ning at least in part the purposes of the project. \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 40 of 54\nundertaking, assess its effects and seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects.” \n36 C.F.R. § 800.1(a); City of Tacoma v. FERC, 460 F.3d 53, 69 (D.C. Cir. 2006). If adverse effects \non historic sites are identified, “the agency must continue consulting with the parties,” Friends of \nthe Atglen-Susquehanna Trail, Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 252 F.3d 246, 253 (3d Cir. 2001), and \n“avoid or mitigate any adverse effect,” Muckleshoot Indian Tribe v. U.S. Forest Serv., 177 F.3d \n800, 805 (9th Cir. 1999). And if an agreement between the ACHP and the agencies responsible for \nthe government action cannot be reached as to a plan for mitigation, the agency “must make clear \nin the record that the ACHP’s comments were taken seriously.” Friends of the Atglen-Susque-\nhanna Trail, 252 F.3d at 265.  \nThe government can comply with Section 106 by coordinating with the ACHP through a pro-\ngrammatic agreement that outlines the mitigation efforts necessary for the project. 36 C.F.R. \n§ 800(b)(2)(iii). But the agencies declined to do that here. See Letter from Rick Gonzalez, ACHP \nVice  Chairman,  to  Hon.  Tom  Vilsack,  Sec’y  of  Agric.  (Mar.  29,  2021), \nhttps://www.achp.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/VilsackResolutionCopperLTR20210329.pdf \n(“ACHP Comments”). Instead, on January 15, 2021, the government released the first EIS with a \nversion of a programmatic agreement that had not been signed by the ACHP. Id. at 4. Due to its \nexclusion, the ACHP terminated its Section 106 consultation with the agencies on February 11, \n2021. See 36 C.F.R. § 800.7(a)(4). Accordingly, after the first EIS was withdrawn, the ACHP \nprovided its comments and recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture in a March 29, 2021 \nletter. The NHPA requires that “the head of the agency shall take into account the Council’s com-\nments in reaching a final decision on the undertaking.” Id. § 800.7(c)(4).  \nThe ACHP identified 43 sites eligible for the National Register that would be transferred to \nResolution Copper and “permanently damaged by proposed mining operations.” ACHP Com-\nments at 3. The comments specifically focused on the Chi’chil Biłdagoteel Historic District and \nemphasized that “[t]he historic significance of Oak Flat cannot be overstated.” Id. at 5. The com-\nments further concluded that the mitigation measures proposed by the programmatic agreement \nwere “wholly inadequate in light of the magnitude of adverse effects to this and other historic \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 41 of 54\nproperties of such significance to numerous Indian tribes.” Id. The ACHP recommended “imme-\ndiate steps” to explore “any and all opportunities to amend or repeal” the NDAA. Id. at 6. Among \nother efforts to “minimize adverse effects,” it recommended assessment of “more sustainable min-\ning techniques in an effort to prevent subsidence at Oak Flat,” and suggested that “USDA should \nemploy all measures at its disposal to incentivize the consideration of such alternatives.” Id. at 7.  \nInstead of adopting these measures, the Secretary of Agriculture decided to end the Section \n106 process, publish the EIS, and initiate the 60-day deadline for transferring Oak Flat. On April \n17, 2025, the USDA Secretary responded to the ACHP in a letter, declining to adopt the ACHP’s \nrecommended measures. Response Letter from Brooke L. Rollins, USDA Sec’y, to Reid Nelson, \nACHP  Exec.  Dir.  (Apr.  17,  2025),  https://www.achp.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/Resolu-\ntionCopperLetter417.pdf. The response provided no substantive discussion of the ACHP’s sug-\ngested mitigation efforts, adopted none of them, and entirely failed to mention the specific sugges-\ntion of incentivizing alternate mining techniques that would prevent the crater from destroying the \nland at Oak Flat. Id.  \nThe NHPA is “aimed solely at discouraging federal agencies from ignoring preservation values \nin projects they initiate.” Lee v. Thornburgh, 877 F.2d 1053, 1056 (D.C. Cir. 1989). But here, the \nUSDA has done just that. The government thus failed to comply with Section 106 by refusing to \ntake sufficient account of the ACHP’s comments, including by refusing to conduct studies of al-\nternative mining methods that would have mitigated adverse effects on the historic and culturally \nsignificant land. Until the government “seriously” considers the ACHP’s suggestions of alternative \nmining techniques by conducting a complete study of non-caving mining methods, the govern-\nment’s actions here—the promulgation of the EIS and the transfer of the land—should be held \nunlawful and “set aside.” Friends of the Atglen-Susquehanna Trail, 252 F.3d at 265; 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2).  \nII. Plaintiffs satisfy the remaining preliminary injunction factors. \n Besides likelihood of success on the merits, the Court must also consider the likelihood of \n“irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,” the “balance of the equities,” and whether \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 42 of 54\npreliminary relief is in “accord with the public interest.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 6. \nHere, each consideration strongly favors Plaintiffs.  \nA.  Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed.  \nThe irreparable-harm inquiry here is straightforward. Both the Supreme Court and the D.C. \nCircuit have recognized that “[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods \nof time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. \nCuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 19 (2020); see also Pursuing America’s Greatness, 831 F.3d at 511. So \npreliminary relief is appropriate if a party shows “that their ‘First Amendment interests are either \nthreatened or in fact being impaired at the time relief is sought.’” Media Matters for Am. v. Paxton, \n138 F.4th 563, 585 (D.C. Cir. 2025). These principles likewise extend to RFRA because “RFRA \nsecures Congress’ view of the right to free exercise under the First Amendment.” Tanzin, 592 U.S. \nat 45; see also Singh, 56 F.4th at 109 (at least where government fails to identify “any relevant \ndaylight,” “a comparably irreparable injury applies to violations of RFRA”) (collecting cases); \nFellowship of Christian Athletes v. District of Columbia, 743 F. Supp. 3d 73, 93 (D.D.C. 2024) \n(“So too for RFRA claims.” (citing Singh)).  \nHere, for the reasons already explained, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment and RFRA rights are at \nminimum being “threatened” by the government’s actions. Media Matters, 138 F.4th at 585. Plain-\ntiffs, like other Apaches, exercise their religion at Oak Flat. Gouyen ¶¶ 22-23; Sinetta ¶¶ 22-23; \nNomie ¶ 17; Angela ¶ 17. But in a matter of days, the government is planning to transfer Oak Flat \nto a copper mining company that intends to obliterate the site, ending Apache religious exercises \nnot just temporarily, but forever. Cf. Diocese of Brooklyn, 592 U.S. at 1920 (pandemic-era re-\nstrictions that “effectively barr[ed] many from attending religious services” struck “at the very \nheart of the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious liberty”). In the government’s own words, \nthe project will cause “permanent[],” “irreversible,” and “irretrievable” harm. 2-EIS-837. Its im-\npact on tribal resources will be “immediate, permanent, and large in scale.” 3-EIS-892. If that isn’t \nirreparable harm, it’s hard to see what is. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 43 of 54\nNor is the irreparable harm limited to completion of the mine. Rather, “even if the site won’t \nbe entirely cratered immediately after conveyance,” “[o]nce the land is transferred, the Western \nApaches will suffer immediate, irreparable harm.” Apache Stronghold, 2021 WL 12295173, at *5 \n(Bumatay, J., dissenting). For one thing, the transfer will authorize Resolution Copper to immedi-\nately begin preparatory activities that are likely to degrade the Oak Flat environment. 1-EIS-61, \nFig. 2.2.2-3. These activities include constructing “new shafts,” “new roads,” a “water treatment \nplant,” an “admin building,” and “substations.” Id. And the transfer would “negate[] the ability of \nthe Tonto National Forest to regulate [the] effects” of Resolution’s activities there. 2-EIS-710, \n781, 826. \nEven more fundamentally, the transfer will immediately make Oak Flat “private property” that \nis “no longer … subject to [federal law] or Forest Service management that provides for tribal \naccess.” 3-EIS-871. Resolution will immediately have the power to restrict the timing and location \nof religious ceremonies there, if not to exclude Plaintiffs and other Apaches from the site alto-\ngether. And Defendants will surely argue that Plaintiffs’ ability to challenge such actions will be \ncurtailed or eliminated by the fact that “Oak Flat will be private property no longer subject to \nRFRA and other federal protections.” Apache Stronghold, 101 F.4th at 1145 (Murguia, C.J., dis-\nsenting); see also Apache Stronghold, 2021 WL 12295173, at *6 (Bumatay, J., dissenting) \n(“[O]nce the land leaves the Government’s hands, the Western Apaches likely cannot bring a \nRFRA or Free Exercise claim against Resolution Copper should the venture burden or extinguish \ntheir ability to worship or access Oak Flat.”). \n This irreparable harm—the transition of Oak Flat from a protected sacred site on federal land \ninto the unprotected private property of a copper mining company—is as imminent as it gets: set \nto take place, absent this Court’s intervention, on August 19. Given Plaintiffs’ strong showing of \nsuccess on the merits, “[t]here is no justification” for requiring Plaintiffs to “remain under a con-\nstant threat that” the land will be transferred and immediately and irreparably harmed. Diocese of \nBrooklyn, 592 U.S. at 20.  \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 44 of 54\nB.  The public interest and balance of equities favor enjoining the land transfer.  \n When the Government is the defendant, the equities and the public interest “merge.” Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). In First Amendment cases like this, the public interest and \nbalance of equities point in Plaintiffs’ favor because the public interest “always” favors the pro-\ntection of constitutional rights. Pursuing America’s Greatness, 831 F.3d at 511; see also, e.g., \nKarem v. Trump, 960 F.3d 656, 668 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (“enforcement of an unconstitutional law is \nalways contrary to the public interest”).  \nHere, both the public interest and balance of equities favor Plaintiffs. “On the Plaintiffs’ side \nof the balance is the weighty public interest in the free exercise of religion that RFRA protects.” \nSingh, 56 F.4th at 107. That interest is at its apex here, where the government’s action does not \njust make religious exercise more costly or hinder it temporarily, but rather threatens to destroy \nthe core sacred site of an entire Native American religious tradition, permanently extinguishing \ncenturies-old religious exercises. See 42 U.S.C. § 1996 (it is “the policy of the United States to \nprotect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and \nexercise the[ir] traditional religions … , including but not limited to access to sites, use and pos-\nsession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites”). \nMeanwhile, unlike Plaintiffs who face serious irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, delaying the transfer of Oak Flat causes no harm to the Government and furthers the public \ninterest. The Government faces no urgency with the transfer, and, in fact, the transfer was proposed \nalmost two decades ago and authorized by statute eleven years ago. See Gorsuch & Thomas, 145 \nS. Ct. at 1482–83. Further, in 2021, the Government unilaterally rescinded the original EIS, Reso-\nlution Copper Project & Land Exchange Environmental Impact Statement: Project Update, U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture (Mar. 1, 2021), https://archive.ph/N65gZ, and its delay in republishing \nthe EIS until 2025 underscores that preliminary relief delaying the transfer causes no harm to the \ngovernment. All the copper the government seeks to have mined will still be there by the time this \ncase is litigated. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 45 of 54\nWithout preliminary relief, Plaintiffs face serious harm to their religious exercise that is im-\nmediate, permanent, and irreversible. A preliminary injunction protecting Oak Flat would cost the \ngovernment nothing, but permitting the government to transfer the land would immediately and \nirreversibly harm Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction and enjoin Defendants \nfrom conveying any right, title, or interest of the United States in Oak Flat to Resolution Copper, \nor otherwise allowing or authorizing Resolution Copper to take any action affecting the physical \nintegrity of Oak Flat, during the pendency of this case. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n/s/ Christian J.

Several \nsprings located on the Oak Flat Federal Parcel will be lost due to the development \nof the subsidence area. The subsidence has a high potential to directly and perma-\nnently adversely affect numerous cultural resources sites, including the following: \narchaeological resources; areas with sacred values such as springs, seeps, and \nprayer locations; resource gathering sites; ancestor burial sites; traditional cere-\nmonial and dance locations; and other places of spiritual and cultural significance \nto members of federally recognized Tribes.” \n1-EIS-12  “The land surface overlying the copper deposit is located in an area that has a \nlong history of use by Native Americans, including the Apache, O’odham, Pueb-\nloan, and Yavapai people . . . .” \n1-EIS-13  “As the ore moves downward and is removed, the land surface above the ore \nbody also moves downward or ‘subsides.’ Analysts expect a ‘subsidence’ zone to \ndevelop near the East Plant Site; there is potential for downward movement to a \ndepth between 800 and 1,115 feet. Resolution Copper projects the subsidence \narea to be up to 1.8 miles wide at the surface.” \n1-EIS-34  “[T]ailings storage facilities are permanent and remain part of the landscape in \nperpetuity.” \n1-EIS-44  “Construction and operation of the mine would profoundly and permanently alter \nthe NRHP-listed Chí’chil Biłdagoteel (Oak Flat) . . . . In addition, development of \nthe proposed tailings storage facility at any of the four proposed or alternative lo-\ncations would permanently bury or otherwise destroy many prehistoric and his-\ntoric cultural artifacts, potentially including human burials.” \n1-EIS-46  “Construction and operation of the Resolution Copper Mine would, as a result of \nanticipated geological subsidence at the East Plant Site, permanently alter the to-\npography and scenic character of the Oak Flat area.” \n1-EIS-60  “Development of the Resolution Copper Mine would directly and permanently \ndamage the NRHP-listed Chí’chil Biłdagoteel Historic District TCP. . . . \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 47 of 54\nDewatering or direct disturbance would impact between 18 and 20 GDEs, mostly \nsacred springs. . . .

[E]ven if the water sources are replaced, the impact on the sense of na-\nture and place for these natural riparian systems would be irreversible. In addi-\ntion, the GDEs directly disturbed by the subsidence area or tailings alternatives \nrepresent irreversible impacts.” \n2-EIS-564  “Seepage from the tailings storage facilities has several unavoidable adverse ef-\nfects. In all cases, the tailings seepage adds a pollutant load to the downstream \nenvironment. . . . The potential impacts on water quality from tailings seepage \nwould cause an irretrievable commitment of water resources downstream of the \ntailings storage facility, lasting as long as seepage continued.” \n2-EIS-598  “With respect to surface water flows from the project area, all action alternatives \nwould result in both irreversible and irretrievable commitment of surface water \nresources.” \n2-EIS-617  “The entire subsidence area would be fenced for public safety.” \n2-EIS-643  “The direct loss of productivity of thousands of acres of various habitat from the \nproject components would result in both irreversible and irretrievable commit-\nment of the resources.” \n2-EIS-663  “The land exchange would have significant effects on recreation. . . . Additional \nrecreational activities that would be lost include camping at the Oak Flat \ncampground, picnicking, and nature viewing. The campground currently provides \napproximately 20 campsites and a large stand of native oak trees.” \n2-EIS-759  “[O]nce the land exchange occurs, Resolution Copper could use hazardous mate-\nrials on this land without approval.” \n2-EIS- “For all action alternatives, there would be an irretrievable loss of scenic quality \n812–13  from increased activity and traffic during the construction and operation phases of \nthe mine. . . .

Resolution of adverse effects (36 CFR 800.6) involves the agency \nconsulting with SHPO, Tribes, and other consulting parties to develop strategies \nto avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects on historic properties.” \n2-EIS-822  “The project area is within the traditional territories of the Western Apache, the \nYavapai, and the Akimel O’odham or Upper Pima. The histories of the Western \nApache—a group that includes ancestors of the White Mountain, San Carlos, Ci-\nbecue, and Tonto Apache—tell of migrations into Arizona where they encoun-\ntered the last inhabitants of villages along the Gila and San Pedro Rivers. The \nWestern Apache practiced a mixed subsistence strategy of farming in the summer \nin the north, and hunting and gathering in the winter in the south. In the 1870s, \nthe Apache were forced onto reservations, which curtailed much of their seasonal \nround. However, not all Apache stayed on the reservations, and some continued \nto use the vicinity of the project area into the twentieth century.” \n2-EIS-826  “The removal of the Oak Flat Federal Parcel from Forest Service jurisdiction ne-\ngates the ability of the Tonto National Forest to regulate effects on these re-\nsources.

[T]he land exchange will have \nan adverse impact on resources significant to the Tribes.” \n3-EIS-873  “In 2015, the Tonto National Forest, in partnership with the San Carlos Apache \nTribe, composed a nomination for Oak Flat, the area originally known as Chí’chil \nBiłdagoteel, to be listed in the NRHP as a TCP (Nez 2016). . . . Places like \nsprings, ancestral (archaeological) sites, plants, animals, and mineral resource lo-\ncations are sacred and should not be disturbed or disrupted. The Oak Flat Federal \nParcel slated to be transferred to Resolution Copper was once part of the tradi-\ntional territories of the Western Apache, the Yavapai, the O’odham, and the \nPuebloan Tribes of Hopi and Zuni. They lived on and used the resources of these \nlands until the lands were taken by force 150 years ago.” \n3-EIS- “After the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe in 1848 . . .

Several massacres of Apache by soldiers and civilians occurred from \nthe 1850s through the 1870s, including the reported events at Apache Leap. In the \n1870s, the Apache were forced off their lands and onto reservations. . . . All these \ncommunities lost large portions of their homelands, including Oak Flat, and today \nlive on lands that do not encompass places sacred to their cultures. . . . Knowing \nthese places is vital to understanding Apache history and, therefore, identity. For \nthe Western Apache, ‘the people’s sense of place, their sense of the tribal past, \nand their vibrant sense of themselves are inseparably intertwined’ (Basso 1996). \nThe Apache landscape is imbued with diyah, or power (Basso 1996). Diyah re-\nsides in natural phenomenon like lightning, in things like water or plants, and in \nplaces like mountains.

The impacts that will occur to Oak \nFlat will undeniably prohibit the Apache people from practicing our ceremonies \nat our Holy site. . . . Our connections to the Oak Flat area are central to who we \nare as Apache people. Numerous people speak of buried family members. . . . The \ndestruction to our lands and our sacred sites has occurred consistently over the \npast century in direct violation of treaty promises and the trust obligation owed to \nIndian tribes. . . . [T]he United States incurred obligations to protect our lands \nfrom harm, and to respect our religion and way of life. Despite these obligations, \nthe U.S. Government has consistently failed to uphold these promises or too often \nfails to act to protect our rights associated with such places like Chí’chil Biłda-\ngoteel.”  \n6-EIS-U-3  “Throughout our history, Oak Flat continues as a vital part of the Apache reli-\ngion, traditions, and culture. In Apache, our word for the area of Oak Flat is \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 53 of 54\nChí’chil Biłdagoteel (a ‘Flat with Acorn Trees’). Oak Flat is a holy and sacred \nsite, and a traditional cultural property with deep religious, cultural, archaeologi-\ncal, historical and environmental significance to Apaches, Yavapais, and other \ntribes. At least eight Apache Clans and two Western Apache Bands have docu-\nmented history in the area. . . . A number of Apache religious ceremonies will be \nheld at Oak Flat this Spring, just as similar ceremonies and other religions and \ntraditional practices have been held for a long as long as Apaches can recall. We \ndo so because Oak Flat is a place filled with power, a place Apaches go: for \nprayer and ceremony, for healing and ceremonial items, or for peace and personal \ncleansing. . . . In the Oak Flat area, there are hundreds of traditional Apache spe-\ncies of plants, birds, insects, and many other living things in the Oak Flat area \nthat are crucial to Apache religion and culture. . . . Only the species within the \nOak Flat area are imbued with the unique power of this area.”  \n6-EIS-U-4  “In the late 1800s, the U.S. Army forcibly removed Apaches from our lands, in-\ncluding the Oak Flat area, to the San Carlos Apache Reservation. We were made \nprisoners of war there until the early 1900s. Our people lived, prayed, and died in \nthe Oak Flat area. . . . Since time immemorial, Apache religious ceremonies and \ntraditional practices have been held at Oak Flat. Article 11 of the Apache Treaty \nof 1852, requires the United States to ‘so legislate and act to secure the permanent \nprosperity and happiness’ of the Apache people. \nClearly, H.R. 687 fails to live up to this promise.”  \n6-EIS-U-6  “How can we practice our ceremonies at Oak Flat when it is destroyed? How will \nthe future Apache girls and boys know what it is to be Apache, to know our home \nwhen it is gone?”  \n6-EIS-U-6  “Chí’chil Biłdagoteel . . . is a place where we pray, collect water and medicinal \nplants for ceremonies, gather acorns and other foods, and honor those that are \nburied here. We have never lost our relationship to Chí’chil Biłdagoteel.”  \n6-EIS-U-7   “My nine year old daughter dreams about having her Apache Sunrise dance cere-\nmony at Oak Flat. The Apaches see Oak Flat differently—it is a church, a place \nfor worship and the practice of our traditional religion. It is the center of our most \nsincerely held, religious beliefs, where diyf' (sacred power) can be called upon \nvia prayers. . . . At least eight Apache clans have direct ties to this location. Tribal \nmembers continue to visit Oak Flat for prayer and a wide range of traditional \nneeds and practices.”  \n6-EIS-U-7  “I pray my son will have the opportunity to sweat at Oak Flat for the first time, \nwhen he becomes a young man. We have gone to many Apache spiritual ceremo-\nnies (Sunrise dances and Holy ground ceremonies) at Oak Flat.”  \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408-TJK     Document 15-1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 54 of 54\n6-EIS-U-8  “My family, my ancestors come from Oak Flat. I grew up there, praying, picking \nthe medicine, picking the acorn, going to the springs, gaining the teachings of my \nrole as an Apache woman so I can pass it down to my daughters. . . . My daugh-\nter, Nizhoni, held her Ceremony at Oak Flat in October 2014. . . . All the ele-\nments of the wind, fire, water, and land go into the Ceremony for my daughter. \nEverything Usen (Creator, God) has created has a significant role in the Cere-\nmony got the 4 days that she prays, dances, connects with all the elements, con-\nnected to our ancestors, connected to the Holy Spirit.

The \nexact springs she went to wash her paint off is being affected by Resolution Cop-\nper Mine already by dewatering the springs. You are already tampering with her \nlife.”  \n6-EIS-U-9  “For at least a half millennium through to the present day, members of our Tribe \nhave utilized the Oak Flat area for traditional religious ceremonies, such as the \nSunrise Dance . . . . It is a place where Apache Holy Ground rituals occur, where \nwe commune with and sing to our Creator God, and celebrate our holy spirits, in-\ncluding our mountain spirits, the Ga’an. It is a place filled with rock paintings and \npetroglyphs, what some may describe as the footprints and the very spirit of our \nancestors, hallmarks akin to the art found in gothic cathedrals and temples, like \nthe Western Wall in Jerusalem, St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City, or Angor Wat \nin Cambodia. This is why I call Oak Flat the Sistine Chapel of Apache religion.”  \n6-EIS-U-9  “I just recently had my coming of age ceremony at Oak Flat and being there \nmeant a lot to me to have my ceremony in a place where all my ancestors used to \nbe. If the Resolution Copper mine continues with destroying Oak Flat, then I will \nnever have a sacred place to come back to or to show my kids where our ances-\ntors gathered.”  \n6-EIS-U- “Oak Flat is so important to me is because I have a very strong connection with \n10  the land. Oak Flat gives me connection with my family and my past ancestors.”  \n6-EIS-U- “Oak Flat is also a place where our members still conduct traditional harvesting \n10  of plants important to our diet, such as acorns from Emory oaks, and healing \nplant-based medicines for a wide range of ailments.”  \n6-EIS-U- “The numerous natural elements, that come from these Holy Sites, are used as \n10  tools to conduct Religious Ceremonies, spiritual sweats, and Sunrise Ceremo-\nnies.”  \n \n45 ",

This case involves the federal government’s plan to destroy a long-recognized Native \nAmerican sacred site in violation of federal statutes and the Constitution. Plaintiffs are Apache \ngirls and women who worship at that site and will be unable to practice and pass down their religion \nif the site is destroyed. Because the government’s plan to destroy the site goes into effect in just \n26 days, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction by August 15, 2025. \n2.  For centuries, Western Apaches have worshipped at a sacred site called Chí’chil Biłda-\ngoteel, or Oak Flat. Oak Flat is the Apaches’ direct corridor to the Creator and the locus of sacred \nrituals that are uniquely tied to that place and cannot be replicated elsewhere.  \n3.  Since the mid-1900s, the government has recognized the significance of Oak Flat, \npreserving it from mining and protecting Apache rituals that take place there. But because a large \ncopper deposit was discovered beneath Oak Flat, the government has now decided to transfer the \nsite to Resolution Copper, a foreign-owned mining company, for the express purpose of creating \na mine that will destroy the site—swallowing it in a massive crater and ending sacred Apache \nrituals forever. \n4.  The government admits that the mine will physically destroy Oak Flat: the impacts will \nbe “immediate, permanent, and large in scale”; all “public access” to the site will be “lost”; nothing \ncan “replace or replicate the tribal resources and [traditional cultural properties] that would be \ndestroyed”; and Apaches will never again be able to carry out their religious practices at Oak Flat. \nUSDA, 3 Final Environmental Impact Statement: Resolution Copper Project & Land Exchange \n892 (June 2025) (i.e., 3-EIS-892), https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/documents/final-eis; 1-EIS-\n153, 327. \n5.  The government also admits that “alternative underground mining methods” “could \nphysically be applied” to recover the copper without cratering the surface of Oak Flat. 4-EIS-F-3. \nHowever, the government has declined to require these alternatives, or even consider them, based \n1 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 4 of 26\n   \n \non Resolution’s claim that these alternatives would have “higher operational costs” and “reduce \nthe amount of ore that could be profitably mined.” Id. \n6.  In other words, the government has authorized the complete physical destruction of an \nirreplaceable Native American sacred site solely to pad the bottom line of a foreign-owned mining \ncompany. \n7.  On June 20, 2025, the Forest Service published its Final Environmental Impact Statement \n(EIS) for the proposed mine—the final agency action setting in motion the transfer and destruction \nof Oak Flat. Publication of the EIS triggers a 60-day deadline for the government to transfer title \nto Oak Flat to Resolution, which the government plans to do, absent judicial intervention, on \nAugust 19, 2025. Resolution can then immediately begin degrading the surface of Oak Flat. \n8.  As explained below, the government’s decision to transfer and destroy Oak Flat violates \nmultiple federal laws and the Constitution. \n9.  First, it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). RFRA provides that the \nfederal government may not “substantially burden” a person’s  religious exercise unless the \ngovernment demonstrates that imposing that burden is “the least restrictive means of furthering” a \n“compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a), (b). By its terms, RFRA applies to \n“all Federal law,” id. § 2000bb-3(a), including laws disposing of federal real property, and it \nexpressly defines the “exercise of religion” to include “[t]he use … of real property for the purpose \nof religious exercise,” id. §§ 2000bb-2, 2000cc-5(7)(B). Six federal appellate judges and two \nSupreme Court Justices have already opined that destroying Oak Flat would substantially burden \nWestern Apaches’ religious exercise. See Apache Stronghold v. United States, 145 S. Ct. 1480, \n1480 (2025) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (citing Apache Stronghold v. United \nStates, 101 F.4th 1036, 1131 (9th Cir. 2024) (en banc) (Murguia, C.J., dissenting)); Apache \nStronghold v. United States, No. 21-15295, 2021 WL 12295173 (9th Cir. Mar. 5, 2021) (Bumatay, \nJ., dissenting). Over the course of years of defending the land transfer, the government has never \neven attempted to show that destroying Oak Flat is the least restrictive means of furthering a \ncompelling governmental interest. Thus, the destruction of Oak Flat violates RFRA. \n2 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 5 of 26\n   \n \n10.  Second, the destruction of Oak Flat violates the First Amendment right of Apache parents \nto direct the religious upbringing of their children. In Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Supreme Court held \nthat “the right of parents ‘to direct the religious upbringing of their’ children would be an empty \npromise if it did not follow those children” onto government property. 145 S. Ct. 2332, 2351 \n(2025). Accordingly, the Court held that reading LGBTQ-inclusive storybooks to children in \npublic schools, without notifying parents or allowing the children to opt out, posed “‘a very real \nthreat of undermining’ the religious beliefs that the parents wish to instill in their children.” Id. at \n2355. Here, the government is not just “subtly” undermining what Apache parents seek to instill \nin their children, id. at 2353; it is destroying a sacred site that is uniquely irreplaceable and \nnecessary to the Apache faith, without which Apache parents will forever be prevented from \ninitiating their children in core Apache religious ways. This is nothing less than “the destruction \nof [a religious] community”—which all nine Justices in Mahmoud agreed was unconstitutional. \nId. at 2392 & n.8 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  \n11.  Third, the destruction of Oak Flat violates the Free Exercise Clause even aside from \nMahmoud, because the government’s actions are neither neutral toward religion nor based on a \ngenerally applicable law. Far from being the unanticipated, incidental effect of a religion-blind \nlaw, the government has made a calculated, discretionary, and individualized decision about a \nsingle piece of land—intentionally favoring the secular use of copper mining over religious use by \nApaches. That sort of discretionary decision to favor secular over religious conduct triggers strict \nscrutiny, which the government cannot satisfy. \n12.  Fourth,  the  EIS  violates  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA).  A  2023 \namendment to NEPA provides that an EIS “shall not exceed 150 pages,” except for projects of \n“extraordinary complexity,” in which case an EIS “shall not exceed 300 pages.” Here, the EIS is \nover 1,000 pages—plainly violating the statute. Even then, the EIS is also woefully underinclusive. \n42 U.S.C. § 4336a(e)(1)(A). While providing many pages of useless information, the EIS fails at \nthe most basic task of considering reasonable alternatives to the proposed agency action, including \n3 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 6 of 26\n   \n \nalternative mining methods that would be far less destructive of Oak Flat. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(iii), \n(F). \n13.  Fifth, the transfer violates the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The NHPA \nrequires the government to identify historical sites that may be harmed by federal projects, and to \nmitigate and avoid harm to those sites. 54 U.S.C. § 306108; 36 C.F.R. § 800.1(a). Oak Flat is \nunquestionably a site of immeasurable historical value, as evidenced by (inter alia) its listing in \nthe National Register of Historic Places. Yet the government has failed to follow the processes set \nout in the NHPA. It has pushed the transfer forward without the support of the NHPA-created \nAdvisory Council on Historical Preservation (ACHP) and has ignored the alternative approaches \nsuggested by the ACHP that would prevent subsidence and mitigate harm to the 43 historical sites \nthat will be destroyed by the mine. This disregard for Oak Flat’s historical value violates the \nNHPA.  \n14.  This nation has a tragic history of destroying Apache lives and land for the sake of mining \ninterests. The history should not—indeed, must not—be repeated here. Multiple federal laws \nprotect Apache religious practices at Oak Flat. This Court should enforce those laws and enjoin \nthe transfer and destruction of Oak Flat. \nPARTIES \n15.  Plaintiff Gouyen Brown is an Apache woman who engages in religious practices at Oak \nFlat. She had her coming-of-age Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat, and Oak Flat is essential to her \nongoing religious exercise and her identity as an Apache woman.  \n16.  Plaintiff Sinetta Lopez is an Apache woman and mother who engages in religious \npractices at Oak Flat. Her adult daughter, Gouyen Brown, had her Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat. \nHer 11-year-old minor daughter also plans to have her Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat. Engaging \nin religious practices with her daughters at Oak Flat is essential to how she brings up her daughters \nin Apache religious ways. It is also essential to her own religious exercise and her identity as an \nApache woman. \n4 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 7 of 26\n   \n \n17.  Plaintiff  Nomie  Brown  is  an  Apache  woman  who  had  her  coming-of-age  Sunrise \nCeremony at Oak Flat. Oak Flat is essential to her ongoing religious exercise and her identity as \nan Apache woman. \n18.  Plaintiff Angela Kinsey is an Apache woman and mother who engages in religious \npractices at Oak Flat. Her seventeen-year-old minor daughter had her coming-of-age ceremony at \nOak Flat. She also hopes that her younger, four-year-old minor daughter can have her coming-of-\nage ceremony at Oak Flat. Engaging in religious practices with her daughters at Oak Flat is \nessential to how she brings up her daughters in Apache religious ways. It is also essential to her \nown religious exercise and her identity as an Apache woman. \n19.  Defendant United States of America (“United States” or “U.S.”) is being sued for the \nwrongful  acts  of  its  representatives,  employees,  and  agencies.  The  United  States  is  further \nimplicated by and through the actions, policies, patterns, practices, and customs of the other \nDefendants and its policymakers, agents, and officers. \n20.  Defendant United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) is the federal department \nresponsible for the management of the United States Forest Service  and national forests, including \nthe Tonto National Forest, in which Oak Flat lies. \n21.  Defendant United States Forest Service (“Forest Service”) is a federal agency of the \nUSDA. By statutory authority and the agency’s own regulations and policies, the Forest Service \nis also responsible for implementing the NHPA, NEPA, and other land management laws and \nregulations pertaining to actions and decisions about lands administered by Defendants. The Forest \nService has an obligation to consult and coordinate with Native American tribes and other \ngovernmental units when making findings and determinations under Section 106 of the NHPA \nregarding the effects of Forest Service-approved projects on cultural resources. Importantly, the \nForest Service has a fiduciary duty under the federal trust responsibility to consult and coordinate \nwith tribes and protect tribal properties, including traditional cultural properties and sacred sites, \nwhen approving and  assessing the effects of projects. Thus, the Forest Service is, by  law, \n5 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 8 of 26\n   \n \nresponsible for the management and actions undertaken with respect to the public lands at issue \nhere. \n22.  Defendant Brooke Rollins is the Secretary of Agriculture and the chief officer for the \nUSDA. Rollins is responsible for the supervision of the Forest Service and the implementation and \nenforcement of applicable law in this proceeding. Rollins is sued in her official capacity. \n23.  Defendant Tom Schultz is the Chief of the Forest Service. Schultz is charged with the \nprimary duties and responsibilities of the United States and the Forest Service, and those as trustee \nand fiduciary regarding management of lands and other assets under Forest Service control or \nresponsibility. Schultz is sued in his official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n24.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367 because Plaintiffs’ claims arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n25.  Venue lies in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because it is a judicial district in \nwhich “a defendant in the action resides” and where “a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred.” \n26.  The challenged agency actions are subject to judicial review and authority pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 702, 704, 706. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nOak Flat \n27.  For centuries, Western Apaches and other tribes have worshipped at a sacred site called \nChí’chil Biłdagoteel (“a broad flat of Emory oak trees”) or Oak Flat. \n28.  Oak Flat is located within a 6.7-square-mile traditional cultural property about three miles \neast of present-day Superior, Arizona, between Apache Leap on the west and Ga’an Canyon (called \nDevil’s Canyon by non-Indians) on the east. \n29.  The terrain is characterized by old-growth oak groves, grassy basins, boulder fields, \njagged cliffs, and perennial waters used by songbirds, mountain lions, foxes, bears, and deer. \n6 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 9 of 26\n   \n \n30.  The  site  also  includes  sacred  springs,  burial  sites,  and  a  singular  concentration  of \narchaeological sites testifying to its persistent use for the past 1,500 years. \n31.  Sometimes described as the birthplace of Western Apache religion, Oak Flat figures \nprominently in Western Apache cosmology as a unique dwelling place of spiritual beings called \nGa’an, who are holy spirits and messengers between the Creator and human beings. \n32.  As the dwelling place of the Ga’an, Oak Flat is a direct corridor to the Creator and is \nuniquely endowed with holiness and medicine. As such, Oak Flat is the site of religious ceremonies \nthat are tied to that place and cannot be replicated elsewhere. \n33.  As one scholar has observed: “For centuries, Western Apaches have maintained close ties \nto [Oak Flat] as a place to collect traditional foods and medicines, a place of ancestral origins, a \nplace where holy beings reside, and the only place where certain prayers, offerings, and ceremonies \ncan be conducted.” Tisa Wenger, Fighting for Oak Flat: Western Apaches and American Religious \nFreedom, 39 J.L. AND RELIGION 247, 248 (2024) (“Wenger”). \n34.  Ceremonies that occur at Oak Flat include sweat lodge ceremonies for boys entering \nmanhood, Holy Ground Ceremonies for blessing and healing, the Sunrise Ceremony marking an \nApache girl’s entry into womanhood, and the gathering of sacred medicine plants, animals, and \nminerals essential to those ceremonies. \n35.  The Holy Ground Ceremony is a blessing and a healing ceremony that a medicine man \nconducts for people who are sick or seek guidance. It takes place at Oak Flat as a holy place for \nhealing, and it draws on holy medicinal plants available only at Oak Flat. It has been performed in \nits current form at Oak Flat for at least 100 years and reflects and builds on much older practices. \n36.  The Holy Ground Ceremony traces back at least to the 1920s and the Apache prophet \nSilas John, who drew on much older traditions. Silas John’s Holy Ground movement “very clearly \nincluded ceremonies at Chi’chil Biłdagoteel [Oak Flat].” Wenger at 257-58. By “selecting sites \nthat  Apaches  already  considered  sacred,  the  Holy  Ground  movement  secured  credibility  in \nIndigenous terms and deepened the sanctity of the places where its ceremonies were held.” Id. at \n259–60.  \n7 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 10 of 26\n   \n \n37.  The federal government actively suppressed the Holy Ground movement by forbidding \nSilas John’s dances and jailing him. Id. at 259. Nevertheless, some families still held Holy Ground \nceremonies at Oak Flat in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Id. And they continue to do so today. \n38.  The Sunrise Ceremony requires months of planning, takes several days to celebrate, and \nis often attended by hundreds of tribal members. To prepare, the girl gathers plants from Oak Flat \nand speaks to the spirit of Oak Flat, expressing gratitude for its resources. Her godmother dresses \nher in the essential tools of womanhood, and tribal members surround her with singing, dancing, \nand prayer. In the night, the Ga’an enter Apache men called crown dancers. The Ga’an bless the \ngirl, who joins their dance. \n39.  On the final day, one of the Ga’an dancers paints the girl with white clay taken from the \nground at Oak Flat, molding her into the woman she is going to be. When her godmother wipes \nthe clay from her eyes, she is a new woman forever imprinted with the spirit of Oak Flat. \n40.  Oak Flat is also the site of several natural springs, which are rare in this arid region, and \nwhich are sources of spiritual power for Apaches. \n41.  One example is Tú Nahikaadi (Dripping Spring), a cave with a dripping spring, which \nhas a unique role in Apache oral tradition. \n42.  According to Apache tradition, a great flood scoured the world, and the matriarch of the \nApache people, Changing Woman, survived the flood and took refuge in a cave with a dripping \nspring. Wenger at 250–51. She emerged alone into this world, and her children, conceived with \nthe Sun, received guidance from the Ga’an on how to live in this land. Id. \n43.  Western Apaches continue to visit Dripping Spring for religious rituals, and the Apache \ngirl in a Sunrise Dance embodies Changing Woman as she dances her way to womanhood. \n44.  Oak Flat is also the site of Tséyaa Gogeschin (translated as Written or Painted under the \nRocks), a large rock overhang with ancient pictographs and petroglyphs—rock art that holds \nspecial meaning for Apache medicine people and provides a tangible, irreplaceable connection to \nApache ancestors. The Chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe has described this artwork as \n“the footprints and the very spirit of our ancestors,” akin to “the Western Wall in Jerusalem, St. \n8 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 11 of 26\n   \n \nPeter’s Basilica in Vatican City, or Angor [sic] Wat in Cambodia. This is why I call Oak Flat the \nSistine Chapel of Apache religion.” 6-EIS-U-9. \nPlaintiffs’ religious practices \n45.  The Plaintiffs in this case include Apache women and girls whose religious practices \ncenter on Oak Flat and who would be unable to continue their religious practices if Oak Flat is \ndestroyed. \n46.  Plaintiff Gouyen Brown had her Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat. During that ceremony, \nshe experienced a profound spiritual connection with the Creator, with the Ga’an, with Mother \nEarth, and with her ancestors. It is where she became a new woman. She continues to return to \nOak Flat to pray, gather medicine, and participate in religious ceremonies. She hopes and intends \nthat her own children will be able to connect with the Creator at Oak Flat, and that her daughters \nwill be able to have their Sunrise Ceremonies at Oak Flat. If Oak Flat is destroyed, she would be \ndevastated. She would be unable to continue core religious practices and unable to bring up her \nchildren in the Apache religious ways. \n47.  Plaintiff Sinetta Lopez is an Apache woman and Gouyen’s mother. She grew up coming \nto Oak Flat with her mother and grandmother, collecting acorns, praying, and participating in \nsacred ceremonies there. Oak Flat is central to her religious practices. As a single mother, Oak Flat \nis central to how she brings up her daughters in the Apache way. \n48.  Sinetta also has a minor daughter, L.B., who is named after an Apache warrior and \nprophet who escaped from imprisonment on the San Carlos Reservation and fought alongside \nGeronimo. Sinetta’s minor daughter has grown up at Oak Flat and has had dreams and encounters \nwith spirits at Oak Flat. She plans to have her Sunrise Ceremony there and remain connected with \nthe Creator and with her ancestors through sacred ceremonies at Oak Flat. \n49.  Plaintiff  Nomie  Brown  is  an  Apache  woman  who  had  her  coming-of-age  Sunrise \nCeremony at Oak Flat. That ceremony fundamentally changed her life, and she continues to return \nto Oak Flat to engage in prayer and religious ceremonies there. Oak Flat is essential to her ongoing \nreligious exercise and her identity as an Apache woman. \n9 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 12 of 26\n   \n \n50.  Plaintiff Angela Kinsey is an Apache woman and mother who engages in religious \npractices at Oak Flat. She grew up coming to Oak Flat with her grandmother and has participated \nin  many  religious  ceremonies  at  Oak  Flat,  including  serving  as  a  godmother  in  a  Sunrise \nCeremony. She has two minor daughters whom she continues to take to Oak Flat to show them \nwhere they came from and to pass on Apache traditions and religious ways. Oak Flat is the place \nwhere she is uniquely able to connect with the Creator. \n51.  Angela’s older minor daughter, V.K., had her coming-of-age ceremony at Oak Flat. She \nhas attended many ceremonies at Oak Flat, and attending and participating in those ceremonies is \nan essential part of her religious practices and identity as an Apache woman. \n52.  Angela’s younger minor daughter, M.K., is four years old. Angela hopes and intends that \nM.K. will be able to have her coming-of-age ceremony at Oak Flat. \n53.  For Plaintiffs, Oak Flat in its entirety is a sacred and holy site. Oak Flat’s protection is \nessential for the continued practice of Apache religious and cultural ways, and they oppose the \nplan to violate the integrity of Oak Flat through mining. \nThe government takes Oak Flat \n54.  Oak Flat was Apache land before the United States existed. \n55.  Beginning in the 1500s, other nations made claims on the area, including Spain and, later, \nMexico. \n56.  The United States first gained an interest in the area in 1848, after the Mexican-American \nWar, when Mexico ceded its claim to the area in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. \n57.  In 1852, to secure peace with the Apaches, the United States entered the Treaty of Santa \nFe with several Apache chiefs. In it, the United States promised to settle the Apaches’ territorial \nboundaries and pass and execute laws conducive to their prosperity and happiness. \n58.  Although the government failed to carry out its obligation to settle territorial boundaries \nformally, the earliest map of the area, prepared by the Smithsonian Institution in 1899, shows Oak \nFlat as Apache territory, not belonging to the United States. \n10 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 13 of 26\n   \n \n59.  Shortly  after  the  1852  Treaty,  settlers  and  miners  entered  the  area  over  Apache \nopposition, and U.S. soldiers and civilians repeatedly massacred Apaches. John R. Welch, Earth, \nWind, and Fire: Pinal Apaches, Miners, and Genocide in Central Arizona, 1859-1874, 7 SAGE \nOpen,  Oct.-Dec.  2017,  https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/2158244017747016  \n(“Welch”). \n60.  In 1862, U.S. Army General James Carleton ordered Apache men to be killed wherever \nfound. Id. at 7. \n61.  When miners discovered gold and silver nearby, General Carleton ordered the Apaches’ \n“removal to a Reservation” or “utter extermination” to protect “all those who go to the country in \nsearch of precious metals.” Id. at 8. \n62.  By 1874, the government had forced 4,000 Apaches onto the San Carlos Reservation—\nnicknamed “Hell’s 40 Acres” because it was a barren wasteland. \n63.  In 1883, the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs issued the Code of Indian Offenses, \nprohibiting traditional Native American religious practices on pain of imprisonment. Hiram Price, \nRules Governing the Court of Indian Offenses, Department of the Interior, Office of Indian Affairs, \nat 4–5 (Mar. 30, 1883). \n64.  The government also forcibly removed hundreds of Apache children from their families, \nsending them to boarding schools aimed at rooting out their “savagism” and converting them to \nChristianity. David Wallace Adams, Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding \nSchool Experience, 1875-1928 6 (1st ed. 1995). \n65.  After decades of conflict over their ancestral lands, the Chiricahua Apaches, led by \nGeronimo, surrendered in 1886 and agreed to be detained for two years in exchange for the return \nof their land. Gilbert King, Geronimo’s Appeal to Theodore Roosevelt, Smithsonian Magazine, \nNov.  9,  2012,  https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/geronimos-appeal-to-theodore-\nroosevelt-117859516/. \n11 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 14 of 26\n   \n \n66.  But the government broke this promise, too. Instead, it held them prisoner for 23 years \nand eventually confined them to the San Carlos Reservation. Native Voices, Timeline, 1886: \nApache armed resistance ends; Geronimo surrenders, U.S. National Library of Medicine. \n67.  The government admits that Oak Flat is “part of the traditional territories of the Western \nApache,” who “lived on and used the resources of these lands”; that the government took Oak Flat \n“by force 150 years ago”; and that because of the government’s actions, Western Apaches “lost \nlarge portions of their homelands, including Oak Flat, and today live on lands that do not \nencompass places sacred to their cultures.” 3-EIS-873–75. \n68.  Starting in the 1900s, the government took steps to protect Oak Flat. \n69.  In 1905, the government created the Tonto National Forest, which includes Oak Flat. \n70.  In 1955, President Eisenhower reserved part of Oak Flat to protect it from mining. 20 \nFed. Reg. 7319, 7336-37 (Oct. 1, 1955). \n71.  In 1971, President Nixon renewed the protection. 36 Fed. Reg. 18,997, 19,029 (Sep. 25, \n1971). \n72.  As recently as 2016, the National Park Service placed Oak Flat in the National Register \nof Historic Places, recognizing “that Chí’chil Biłdagoteel is an important feature of the Western \nApache landscape as a sacred site, as a source of supernatural power, and as a staple in their \ntraditional  lifeway.”  Chí’chil  Biłdagoteel  Historic  District,  Traditional  Cultural  Property, \nNational Register of Historic Places Registration Form (NPS Form 10-900) at 8, National Park \nService (Jan. 2016). \nResolution Copper lobbied for a land transfer \n73.  In 1995, a large copper deposit was discovered 4,500 to 7,000 feet beneath Oak Flat. \n74.  In 2004, two large multinational mining companies, Rio Tinto and BHP, formed a joint \nventure called Resolution Copper and began lobbying Congress to transfer Oak Flat so Resolution \ncould mine the deposit. \n75.  Between 2005 and 2013, Congress considered at least twelve standalone bills to transfer \nOak Flat to Resolution. Each failed. \n12 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 15 of 26\n   \n \n76.  Lacking congressional support for a standalone bill, Resolution and its allies tried a \ndifferent tack. \n77.  Each year, Congress passes the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which is \nnecessary legislation to fund the military. In 2014, the NDAA was 698 pages long and authorized \nhundreds of billions of dollars in defense spending. See Carl Levin and Howard P. “Buck” McKeon \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, 128 Stat. 3292. At the last minute, \nSenators McCain and Flake attached to that bill the land-transfer provision—called the “Southeast \nArizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act”—without a separate vote or debate. The land-\ntransfer provision then passed as Section 3003 of the NDAA. § 3003, 128 Stat. 3732–3741. \n78.  Section 3003 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer title to approximately \n2,422 acres of Forest Service lands, including Oak Flat, to Resolution, in exchange for other \nparcels of land owned by Resolution scattered elsewhere in Arizona. § 3003(b)(2), (b)(4), (c)(1), \n(d)(1), id., at 3732–3737. \n79.  Section 3003 also revokes the orders by Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon protecting Oak \nFlat. § 3003(i)(1)(A), id., at 3740. \n80.  Section 3003 instructs that, before conveying any federal land, the Secretary  must \n“prepare a single environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act \n[(NEPA)] which shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the \nproposed mine and the Resolution mine plan of operations and any related major Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment, including the granting of any permits, \nrights-of-way,  or  approvals  for  the  construction  of  associated  power,  water,  transportation, \nprocessing, tailings, waste disposal, or other ancillary facilities.” § 3003(c)(9)(B), id., at 3735–\n3736. \n81.  Section  3003  also  requires  the  Secretary  to  “engage  in  government-to-government \nconsultation with affected Indian tribes concerning issues of concern to the affected Indian tribes \nrelated to the land exchange.” § 3003(c)(3)(A), id., at 3733. Following consultation with the Indian \ntribes, the Secretary must consult with Resolution “and seek to find mutually acceptable measures \n13 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 16 of 26\n   \n \nto—(i) address the concerns of the affected Indian tribes; and (ii) minimize the adverse effects on \nthe affected Indian tribes resulting from mining and related activities on the Federal land conveyed \nto Resolution Copper under this section.” § 3003(c)(3)(B), id., at 3733. \n82.  Once the Secretary publishes the EIS, Section 3003 provides that “the Secretary shall \nconvey all right, title, and interest of the United States” in Oak Flat “to Resolution Copper” within \n“60 days.” § 3003(c)(10), id., at 3736. \nResolution Copper’s mine will destroy Oak Flat \n83.  The government initially published an EIS on January 15, 2021, but withdrew it a few \nweeks later, stating that it needed additional “time” to “fully understand concerns raised by \nTribes.” USDA, Resolution Copper Project & Land Exchange Environmental Impact Statement: \nProject Update (Feb. 21, 2023), https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/. \n84.  Before publishing the EIS, the government failed to coordinate with the ACHP in the \nproduction of a plan to mitigate harm to Oak Flat’s historical features. \n85.  Due  to  this  failure,  the  ACHP  submitted  comments  in  March  2021  that  included \nsuggestions to which the agencies were required to respond. \n86.  The government declined to adopt the ACHP’s suggestions in a letter issued in April \n2025. \n87.  The government republished the EIS on June 20, 2025. \n88.  The EIS confirms that the mine will destroy Oak Flat. \n89.  The copper is located between 4,500 and 7,000 feet below Oak Flat’s surface. To mine \nit, Resolution will use a technique called panel caving, which involves tunneling beneath the ore, \nfracturing it with explosives, and removing it from below. \n90.  This method is cheaper than other feasible mining techniques but far more destructive of \nOak Flat’s surface. \n91.  Once the ore is removed, approximately 1.37 billion tons of toxic waste (“tailings”) will \nneed to be stored forever. This will permanently bury or otherwise destroy many prehistoric and \n14 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 17 of 26\n   \n \nhistoric cultural artifacts, including human burials. Oak Flat itself will collapse (“subside”) into a \ncrater almost 2 miles across and 800 to 1,110 feet deep. \n92.  The EIS admits that the impacts of the mine will be “immediate, permanent, and large in \nscale”; that all “public access” to the site will be “lost”; and that nothing can “replace or replicate \nthe Tribal resources and [traditional cultural properties] that would be destroyed.” 1-EIS-153; 3-\nEIS-892. \n93.  Among other things, the mine will destroy the places used for Sunrise, Holy Grounds, \nand other sacred ceremonies; old-growth oak groves and sacred medicinal plants; sacred springs, \nincluding Dripping Spring; burial grounds; and ancient religious and cultural artifacts, including \nthe centuries-old petroglyphs of Tséyaa Gogeschin. \n94.  The destruction of Oak Flat will terminate the Apaches’ access to the site, destroy the \nfoods, medicines, springs, artifacts and locations that are essential to their religious practices, and \nmake it physically impossible for the Apaches to ever engage in their core religious practices again. \nImpacted groups challenged the 2021 EIS \n95.  When the government initially published an EIS in 2021 (before withdrawing it a few \nweeks later), three lawsuits were filed challenging the adequacy of the EIS and the legality of the \nland transfer. Apache Stronghold v. United States, No. 2:21-cv-50 (D. Ariz. Jan. 12, 2021); San \nCarlos Apache Tribe v. U.S. Forest Serv., No. 2:21-cv-68 (D. Ariz. Jan. 14, 2021); Ariz. Mining \nReform Coal. v. U.S. Forest Serv., No. 2:21-cv-122 (D. Ariz. Jan. 22, 2021). \n96.  Two of those lawsuits focused on the adequacy of the 2021 EIS and were stayed when \nthe EIS was withdrawn on March 1, 2021. Order, San Carlos Apache Tribe, No. 2:21-cv-68 (D. \nAriz. Mar. 23, 2021), ECF No. 47; Order, Ariz. Mining Reform Coal., No. 2:21-cv-122 (D. Ariz. \nMar. 16, 2021), ECF No. 35. \n97.  One of the lawsuits challenged the legality of the land transfer under the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act and First Amendment and sought an emergency injunction. The district \ncourt declined to enjoin the land transfer. Apache Stronghold, No. 2:21-cv-50, 2021 WL 689906 \n(D. Ariz. Feb. 22, 2021). The en banc Ninth Circuit affirmed by a sharply divided, 6-5 vote. Apache \n15 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 18 of 26\n   \n \nStronghold, 101 F.4th 1036. The Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari on May 27, 2025, over \na dissenting opinion from Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas, Apache Stronghold, 145 S. \nCt. 1480, and is currently considering a petition for rehearing asking it to reconsider the denial of \ncertiorari, Apache Stronghold v. United States, No. 24-291 (U.S. petition for rehearing filed June \n23, 2025). \nThe government issued a new EIS and sped ahead with the land transfer \n98.  On March 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14241, titled Immediate \nMeasures to Increase American Mineral Production. Exec. Order No. 14241, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,673 \n(Mar. 20, 2025). Executive Order 14241 states that the United States must “take immediate action \nto facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent” and orders agencies to \n“identify  priority  projects  that  can  be  immediately  approved  or  for  which  permits  can  be \nimmediately issued.” Id. §§ 1, 3. \n99.  On June 20, 2025, the Forest Service published a new final EIS. \n100. After publication of the EIS, the government must convey Oak Flat to Resolution within \n60 days, which the government has represented that it intends to do on August 19, 2025. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. \n101. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n102. Under RFRA, “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” \nunless it satisfies strict scrutiny. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a)-(b). \n103. Strict scrutiny requires that the government “demonstrates that application of the burden \nto the person–(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b); \nSingh v. Berger, 56 F.4th 88, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \n16 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 19 of 26\n   \n \n104. RFRA broadly defines the “exercise of religion” to include “any exercise of religion, \nwhether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(4) \n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5). \n105. RFRA also defines the “exercise of religion” to include “[t]he use ... of real property” for \nreligious exercise. Id. §§ 2000bb-2(4), 2000cc-5(7)(B). \n106. A compelling interest includes “only those interests of the highest order.” Wisconsin v. \nYoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215 (1972). And the least-restrictive-means standard is “exceptionally \ndemanding.” Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 728 (2014). To pass the least-\nrestrictive-means test, the government must show “that it lacks other means of achieving its desired \ngoal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion” by the religious objector. \nId. \n107. Plaintiffs  exercise  their  religion  by  visiting,  praying,  and  participating  in  sacred \nceremonies that are uniquely tied to Oak Flat and cannot be replicated elsewhere.  Plaintiffs intend \nto  continue  in  their  religious  exercise  at  Oak  Flat  through  their  ongoing,  imminent,  active \nparticipation in ceremonies and religious observances at Oak Flat. \n108. The transfer and destruction of Oak Flat substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n109. Denying Plaintiffs access to Oak Flat substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n110. Physically destroying Plaintiffs’ sacred site substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ religious \nexercise.  \n111. Interfering  with  Plaintiffs’  religious  ceremonies  at  Oak  Flat  substantially  burdens \nPlaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n112. Completely preventing Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion at Oak Flat substantially burdens \nPlaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n113. Defendants cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. \n17 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 20 of 26\n   \n \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \nProhibition of Free Exercise \n114. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n115. The  First  Amendment  provides  that  “Congress  shall  make  no  law  respecting  an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n116. Under the Free Exercise Clause, government action burdening religion is protected from \nstrict scrutiny only if it constitutes a valid and neutral law of general applicability. \n117. Failing either the neutrality or general applicability test is sufficient to trigger strict \nscrutiny.  \n118. The government’s action here burdens Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n119. The government’s action here is neither neutral nor generally applicable. \n120. The  government’s  action  is  neither  neutral  nor  generally  applicable  because  it \ndisproportionately affects the religious exercise of Native Americans and almost no others, and \nbecause it was enacted with hostility toward Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n121. The government’s action is neither neutral nor generally applicable because it involves a \ncalculated,  discretionary,  and  individualized  decision  about  a  single  piece  of  land,  and  it \nintentionally favors the secular use of copper mining over religious use by Apaches. \n122. The government’s action cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \nBurden on the Right to Direct the Religious Upbringing of Children \n123. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n124. The government’s actions are subject to strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause \nwhen they “substantially interfer[e] with the religious development” of children. Mahmoud, 145 \nS. Ct. at 2356 (quoting Yoder, 406 U.S. at 218). \n18 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 21 of 26\n   \n \n125. When the government’s actions impose an “objective danger,” or a “very real threat of \nundermining” parents’ religious exercise, they impose a burden on religious exercise. Id. at 2349, \n2355. \n126. The relevant religious exercise here is the plaintiff parents’ ability to raise their children \nin accordance with their Apache religious beliefs, which includes worship, prayer, gathering \nmedicine, and holding religious ceremonies at Oak Flat. \n127. By transferring and destroying Oak Flat, the government is cutting off Apache parents \nfrom ever engaging in core religious practices that are essential to their children’s religious \ndevelopment. This not only poses an “objective danger” or “very real threat of undermining” \nPlaintiffs’ religious exercise, but also renders it altogether physically impossible. \n128. The government’s actions cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the National Environmental Policy Act \n129. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n130. The National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370, is designed to ensure \nthat the government’s actions are consistent with the “broad national commitment to protecting \nand promoting environmental quality.” Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. \n332, 348 (1989). \n131. NEPA realizes its “sweeping policy goals” “through a set of ‘action-forcing’ procedures \nthat require that agencies take a ‘hard look at environmental consequences’” before engaging in \ncertain projects. Id. at 350 (quoting Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 410 n.21 (1976)). \n132. The land-transfer statute instructs the government to “carry out the land exchange in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act”  in  “a  single \nenvironmental impact statement.” § 3003(c)(9)(A)–(B), 128 Stat. 3735.  \n133. By expressly incorporating NEPA, Congress indicated that the government must take a \nhard  look  at  the  land  transfer’s  environmental  consequences  and  then  show  its  work  in  a \n19 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 22 of 26\n   \n \n“reasonable and reasonably explained” EIS. Seven Cnty. Infrastructure. Coal. v. Eagle County, \n145 S. Ct. 1497, 1511 (2025). \n134. In 2023, Congress amended NEPA through the BUILDER Act, Pub. L. 118-5, Div. C, \nTit. III, § 321, 137 Stat. 38–39, which sets a default rule that an EIS “shall not exceed 150 pages.” \n42 U.S.C. § 4336a(e)(1)(A); accord Seven Cnty., 145 S. Ct. at 1512 n.3. \n135. For projects of “extraordinary complexity,” an EIS “shall not exceed 300 pages.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 4336a(e)(1)(B). \n136. The EIS in this case is over 1,000 pages. It also includes appendices adding approximately \n1,400 more pages. Thus, the EIS exceeds NEPA’s length limitation. \n137. NEPA further requires that agencies “include in every recommendation or report on … \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed \nstatement by the responsible official on—(iii) a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed \nagency action, including an analysis of any negative environmental impacts of not implementing \nthe proposed  agency action in the case of a no action alternative, that are technically  and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need of the proposal.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(iii). \n138. NEPA  also  requires  that  agencies  “study,  develop,  and  describe  technically  and \neconomically feasible alternatives” to proposed plans. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(F).  \n139. The  EIS  here  does  not  comply  with  NEPA’s  requirement  to  consider  reasonable \nalternatives.  Instead,  the  EIS  admits  that  “alternative  underground  mining  methods”  “could \nphysically be applied” to recover the copper without disturbing the surface of Oak Flat, but \ndeclines to even consider them based on Resolution’s claim that these alternatives would have \n“higher operational costs” and “reduce the amount of ore that could be profitably mined.” 4-EIS-\nF-3. The failure to consider reasonable alternatives violates NEPA. \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the National Historic Preservation Act \n140. Congress enacted the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 54 U.S.C. §§ 300101 \net seq., in 1966, with the goal of identifying and protecting the nation’s historical treasures. \n20 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 23 of 26\n   \n \n141. The NHPA requires federal agencies to consider the impact of any undertaking on \nproperties of historical significance, including traditional religious and cultural importance to an \nIndian tribe. \n142. Section 106 of the NHPA requires that, prior to issuance of a federal permit or license, \nfederal  agencies  shall  take  into  consideration  the  effects  of  an  “undertaking”  on  “historic \npropert[ies].” 54 U.S.C. § 306108. Agencies “must complete the section 106 process ‘prior to the \napproval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any \nlicense.’”  36  C.F.R.  § 800.1(c).  The  NHPA  established  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic \nPreservation (“ACHP”), an independent federal agency with the primary mission to encourage \nhistoric preservation in the government and across the nation. \n143. The NHPA defines undertaking as “a project, activity, or program funded in whole or in \npart under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including – (1) those carried out \nby or on behalf of the Federal agency; (2) those carried out with Federal financial assistance; \n(3) those requiring a Federal permit, license, or approval; and (4) those subject to State or local \nregulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a Federal agency.” 54 U.S.C. \n§ 300320; 36 C.F.R. § 800.16(y). \n144. The NHPA Section 106 process requires federal agencies involved in undertakings to \nmake a reasonable and good faith effort to identify and disclose historic properties within affected \nareas, evaluate the potential adverse effects of the federal undertaking to the historic properties, \nand seek ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any adverse effects to the historic properties. 36 \nC.F.R. §§ 800.4-800.6. \n145. The Section 106 process requires consultation with Indian Tribes on federal undertakings \nthat potentially affect sites that are culturally significant to Indian Tribes. 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(2); \n54 U.S.C. § 302706 (properties “of traditional religious and cultural importance to” a Tribe may \nbe included on the National Register, and federal agencies “shall consult with any Indian Tribe … \nthat attaches religious and cultural significance” to such properties). \n21 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 24 of 26\n   \n \n146. If the agency finds that historic properties are affected, it must provide notification to all \nconsulting parties and invite their views to assess adverse effects. 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(2). Any \nadverse effects to historic properties must be resolved, involving all consulting parties and the \npublic. Id. § 800.6. If adverse effects cannot be resolved, the process is elevated again to the ACHP \nand the head of the agency undertaking the action. Id. § 800.7. Until this process is complete, the \naction in question cannot go forward. \n147. If adverse effects on historic sites are identified, the agency must continue consulting with \nthe parties and avoid or mitigate any adverse effects. \n148. If an agreement between the ACHP and the agencies cannot be reached as to a plan for \nmitigation, the agency “must make clear in the record that the ACHP’s comments were taken \nseriously.” Friends of the Atglen-Susquehanna Trail, Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 252 F.3d 246, \n265 (3d Cir. 2001). \n149. The government failed to coordinate with the ACHP before it issued the first EIS in 2021. \n150. In 2025, before issuing the second EIS, the government responded to the ACHP’s \ncomments suggesting mitigation efforts to preserve Oak Flat.  \n151. However, the agency’s response failed to take seriously the ACHP’s recommendations \nand refused to mitigate the harm to Oak Flat and other historic properties that will be destroyed by \nthe mine. This violated the NHPA. \nCOUNT VI \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n152. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n153. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n154. For the reasons given above, the EIS is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.” Id. \n155. Accordingly, the EIS must be vacated and set aside. \n22 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 25 of 26\n   \n \n156. Defendants’ APA violations have caused and will continue to cause ongoing irreparable \nharm to Plaintiffs. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:  \na.  Declare that the transfer and destruction of Oak Flat violates and is invalid under RFRA; \nb.  Declare that the transfer and destruction of Oak Flat violates and is invalid under the Free \nExercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nc.  Declare that the Defendants’ actions violate NEPA, the NHPA, the APA, other laws noted \nherein, and the implementing regulations and policies of these laws;  \nd.  Issue a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from conveying any right, title, or \ninterest of the United States in Oak Flat to Resolution Copper or otherwise allowing or \nauthorizing Resolution Copper to take any action affecting the physical integrity of Oak \nFlat; \ne.  Set aside and vacate the EIS and void any actions or decisions based on the EIS; \nf.  Award  Plaintiffs  compensatory  and  nominal  damages  for  the  loss  of  their  rights  as \nprotected by the United States Constitution, RFRA, and other federal laws; \ng.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this action and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and  \nh.  Award such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable and just. \nJURY DEMAND \nPlaintiffs request a trial by jury on all issues so triable. \n \n[Signature page attached] \n   \n23 \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 26 of 26\n   \n \nRespectfully submitted this 24th day of July, 2025. \n \n/s/ Christian J.

For the \n17  reasons that follow, both motions are denied. \n18  RELEVANT BACKGROUND \n19  I.  Overview Of SALECA \n20    In 2014, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 \n21  (“NDAA”), Congress enacted the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act \n22  (“SALECA”).  SALECA authorizes the exchange of 2,422 acres of federal land in the \n23  Tonto National Forest for land held by a private company, Resolution Copper (“Resolution \n24  Copper”).  The federal land to be transferred to Resolution Copper includes an Apache \n25  ceremonial ground called Chí’chil Biłdagoteel.  That area, known in English as Oak Flat, \n26  “is a site of great spiritual value to the Western Apache Indians, who believe that it is \n27  indispensable to their religious worship,” but “also sits atop the world’s third-largest \n28  deposit of copper ore.”  Apache Stronghold v. United States, 101 F.4th 1036, 1044 (9th \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 2 of 20\n \n \n \n1  Cir. 2024) (en banc).  Congress’s intent in authorizing the land exchange was “[t]o take \n2  advantage of that deposit” by enabling Resolution Copper to “mine the ore.”  Id.  \n3    Under SALECA, the United States Forest Service (“Forest Service”) must prepare \n4  an environmental impact statement “[p]rior to conveying Federal land,” and the Forest \n5  Service must then convey that land to Resolution Copper “[n]ot later than 60 days after \n6  publication.”  16 U.S.C. § 539p(c)(9)(B), (c)(10). \n7    On January 15, 2021, the Forest Service published what was, at the time, the final \n8  environmental impact statement (“FEIS”).  Thus, under SALECA, the land exchange was \n9  required to occur within the next 60 days, i.e., by March 16, 2021.   \n10  II.  The Three Earlier Lawsuits Challenging The Land Exchange \n11  In early 2021, three sets of plaintiffs filed lawsuits in the District of Arizona, each \n12  seeking a preliminary injunction to preclude the land exchange from going forward.   \n13  A.  Apache Stronghold \n14  In the first-filed action,  Apache Stronghold v. United States et al., No. 21-cv-50-\n15  PHX-SPL  (hereinafter,  “Apache  Stronghold”),  the  plaintiff—a  nonprofit  organization \n16  formed  to  preserve  and  protect  American  Indian  sacred  sites—alleged  that  the  land \n17  exchange would violate the rights of members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe (“the Tribe”) \n18  under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, the Religious Freedom Restoration \n19  Act (“RFRA”), and an 1852 treaty between the United States and the Tribe.  The procedural \n20  history of Apache Stronghold is complex, but the relevant developments are as follows.   \n21  On February 12, 2021, Judge Logan denied the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary \n22  injunction, concluding that the plaintiff had not established a likelihood of success or even \n23  serious questions going to the merits of its claims.  (Apache Stronghold, Doc. 57.)  The \n24  plaintiff appealed, and on February 22, 2021, Judge Logan denied the plaintiff’s motion \n25  for an injunction or stay pending appeal.  (Apache Stronghold, Doc. 64.)   \n26  On March 1, 2025—only 15 days before  the 60-day transfer deadline was to \n27  expire—the Forest Service rescinded the FEIS.  (Apache Stronghold, Doc. 80 at 1 n.1.)  As \n28  a result, on March 5, 2021, the Ninth Circuit motions panel (over the dissent of Judge \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 3 of 20\n \n \n \n1  Bumatay) denied the plaintiff’s emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, \n2  concluding that the request was “premature” in light of the recission of the FEIS.  Apache \n3  Stronghold v. United States, 2021 WL 12295173, *1 (9th Cir. 2021).   \n4  On June 24, 2022, the Ninth Circuit three-judge merits panel (over the dissent of \n5  Judge Berzon) affirmed the denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction, agreeing with \n6  Judge Logan that the plaintiff was unlikely to succeed on its RFRA, Free Exercise, and \n7  treaty-based claims.  Apache Stronghold v. United States, 38 F.4th 742 (9th Cir. 2022).  \n8  However, the Ninth Circuit then voted to rehear the case en banc.   \n9  On May 14, 2024, the en banc court issued an amended 6-5 decision that again \n10  affirmed the denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction due to the plaintiff’s failure \n11  to establish a likelihood of success on the merits.  Apache Stronghold v. United States, 101 \n12  F.4th 1036 (9th Cir. 2024) (en banc).   \n13  On May 27, 2025, the Supreme Court (over the dissent of Justices Gorsuch and \n14  Thomas) denied the plaintiff’s petition for certiorari.  Apache Stronghold v. United States, \n15  145 S. Ct. 1480 (2025).   \n16  On June 23, 2025, the plaintiff filed a petition for rehearing with the Supreme Court, \n17  arguing that the Court should defer ruling on the petition for certiorari pending the issuance \n18  of the Court’s decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor.   \n19  On June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court decided Mahmoud v. Taylor, 145 S. Ct. 2332 \n20  (2025). \n21  On July 3, 2025, Plaintiff filed a supplemental brief seeking a GVR (i.e., grant, \n22  vacate, and remand order) in light of Mahmoud.   \n23  As of today, August 17, 2025, the Supreme Court has not taken action on those \n24  requests.1 \n25  … \n26  … \n27   \n1   The Supreme Court docket contains links to the recent filings identified above.  \n28  https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-\n291.html.   \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 4 of 20\n \n \n \n1  B.  San Carlos And AMRC \n2  The other two actions filed in 2021 were San Carlos Apache Tribe v. United States \n3  Forest Service et al., No. 21-cv-68-PHX-DWL (hereinafter, “San Carlos”), and Arizona \n4  Mining Reform Coalition v. United States Forest Service et al., No. 21-cv-122-PHX-DWL \n5  (hereinafter, “AMRC”).  Both actions were eventually assigned to the undersigned judge.   \n6  In each action, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in early 2021 \n7  but then withdrew the motion based on the March 1, 2021 recission of the FEIS.  (San \n8  Carlos, Docs. 29, 42; AMRC, Docs. 9, 29.)  Both cases were then stayed pending the \n9  reissuance of the FEIS.  (San Carlos, Doc. 47; AMRC, Doc. 35.) \n10  On June 20, 2025, the Forest Service published a new version of the FEIS.  Thus, \n11  under SALECA, the land exchange must occur within the next 60 days, i.e., by August 19, \n12  2025.  16 U.S.C. § 539(c)(10).  For reasons that are unnecessary to detail here, the Court \n13  issued an order precluding the Forest Service from proceeding with the land exchange until \n14  the very last day of that period, August 19, 2025.  (San Carlos, Doc. 99; AMRC, Doc. 81.) \n15  Following the publication of the new FEIS, the plaintiffs in San Carlos and AMRC \n16  filed amended complaints and new motions for a preliminary injunction.  (San Carlos, \n17  Docs. 104, 105; AMRC, Docs. 86, 87.)  Presumably in light of the developments in Apache \n18  Stronghold, those motions did not raise any RFRA, Free Exercise, or treaty-based claims.  \n19  Instead, the claims underlying those motions fell into the following four categories:  \n20  •  Appraisal Claims:  Under SALECA, the Forest Service must perform an appraisal \n21  to calculate the value of the federal and non-federal land to be exchanged.  16 U.S.C.             \n22  § 539p(c)(4).  SALECA also creates an “equalization process” providing that if the federal \n23  land is more valuable than the non-federal land, Resolution Copper must make up the \n24  difference  by  conveying  additional  land  and/or  “mak[ing]  a  cash  payment.”    Id.                        \n25  § 539p(c)(5)(B)(i).  AMRC argued that the Forest Service violated its appraisal-related \n26  duties under SALECA by failing to account for the value of the copper deposits underlying \n27  one of the federal parcels to be exchanged, known as the Mining Claim Zone (“MCZ”) \n28  parcel—an  omission  that,  according  to  AMRC,  resulted  in  the  Forest  Service  “low-\n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 5 of 20\n \n \n \n1  ball[ing] the appraised value” of that parcel by potentially billions of dollars.  (AMRC, Doc. \n2  97 at 10.) \n3  •  NEPA Claims: SALECA provides that “[p]rior to conveying Federal land under \n4  this section, the Secretary [of Agriculture] shall prepare a single environmental impact \n5  statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [‘NEPA’], which shall be \n6  used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the proposed mine and the \n7  Resolution mine plan of operations and any related major Federal actions significantly \n8  affecting the quality of the human environment, including the granting of any permits, \n9  rights-of-way, or approvals for the construction of associated power, water, transportation, \n10  processing,  tailings,  waste  disposal,  or  other  ancillary  facilities.”    16  U.S.C.                                 \n11  § 539p(c)(9)(B).  In their motions, AMRC and the Tribe identified an array of perceived \n12  NEPA-related shortcomings and omissions in the FEIS. \n13  •  Consultation Claims:  SALECA provides that “[t]he Secretary shall engage in \n14  government-to-government consultation with affected Indian tribes concerning issues of \n15  concern  to  the  affected  Indian  tribes  related  to  the  land  exchange.”    16  U.S.C.                             \n16  § 539p(c)(3)(A).  Additionally, under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act \n17  (“NHPA”), agencies “shall take into account the effect of an undertaking on any historic \n18  property”  and  afford  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic  Preservation  (“ACHP”)  “a \n19  reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to the undertaking.”  Tohono O’odham \n20  Nation v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 138 F.4th 1189, 1193 (9th Cir. 2025) (cleaned up).  In \n21  its motion, the Tribe argued that the Forest Service did not fulfill these consultation duties \n22  before publishing the FEIS. \n23  •  NFMA Claims:  The National Forest Management Act (“NFMA”) includes a \n24  provision that requires the Forest Service to prepare a land and resource management plan \n25  for each national forest.  16 U.S.C. § 1604(a).  Such a plan exists for the Tonto National \n26  Forest (the “Forest Plan”) and was last amended in 2023.  In the FEIS, the Forest Service \n27  acknowledges that some of the contemplated mining-related activities will occur within the \n28  Tonto National Forest and thus require an amendment of the Forest Plan (San Carlos, Doc. \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 6 of 20\n \n \n \n1  105-9 at 11, 54), and the draft record of decision (“DROD”) proposes 16 amendments to \n2  the Forest Plan that would be required for approving Skunk Camp as the preferred tailings \n3  storage facility alternative (AMRC, Doc. 87-3 at 19-25).  In its motion, AMRC argued that \n4  this approach violates NFMA’s forest planning regulations, which appear at 36 C.F.R. Part \n5  219, because those regulations require a public notice-and-comment process “which did \n6  not occur here” before any forest plan may be amended.  (AMRC, Doc. 87 at 28.) \n7  On August 6, 2025, soon after the preliminary injunction motions became fully \n8  briefed, the Court held a lengthy motion hearing in San Carlos and AMRC.   \n9  On August 15, 2025, the Court issued a 94-page order (hereinafter, “the August 15, \n10  2025 order”) denying both preliminary injunction motions.  (San Carlos, Doc. 124; AMRC, \n11  Doc. 99.)  The August 15, 2025 order also specified that that the Court would deny the \n12  plaintiffs’ requests for an injunction pending appeal.  (Id.) \n13  That same day, both sets of plaintiffs filed interlocutory appeals.  (San Carlos, Doc. \n14  125; AMRC, Doc. 100.)   \n15  III.  This Action \n16    On July 24, 2025, Plaintiffs initiated this action in the United States District Court \n17  for the District of Columbia.  (Doc. 1.)   \n18    On July 25, 2025, there was a flurry of activity.  Among other things, the Federal \n19  Defendants moved to transfer this action to the District of Arizona (Doc. 7), Resolution \n20  Copper moved to intervene (Doc. 10) and filed a separate transfer request (Doc. 12), and \n21  Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction (Doc. 15). \n22    On August 1, 2025, Judge Kelly granted Resolution Copper’s intervention request, \n23  set a briefing schedule on the preliminary injunction motion (with Defendants’ responses \n24  due  by  August  5,  2025  and  Plaintiffs’  reply  due  by  August  11,  2025),  and  granted \n25  Defendants’ transfer requests.  In the memorandum explaining the transfer decision, Judge \n26  Kelly noted, among other things, that Plaintiffs’ conduct “raises the specter of forum-\n27  shopping” because the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Apache Stronghold “would appear to \n28  doom many of their First Amendment and RFRA claims.”  (Doc. 28 at 6.) \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 7 of 20\n \n \n \n1    On  August  5,  2025,  after  the  transfer  was  processed,  the  undersigned  held  a \n2  telephonic status conference with the parties.  (Doc. 34.)  Among other things, the Court \n3  authorized the parties to file oversized briefs and explained that “because many of the \n4  matters in this case seem to overlap with some of the arguments that are already being \n5  raised in the two cases that are previously before me that I’ll be having the [preliminary \n6  injunction] hearing tomorrow in, it’s not entirely clear to me that we’re going to need to \n7  hold a separate hearing in this case. . . .  I’m obviously going to be hard at work after the \n8  hearing tomorrow working on the order in the other two cases.  It seems to me that by the \n9  time the reply comes in on this case on August 11th, I’ll have a much better sense on \n10  whether an additional hearing is needed.  So I’d be inclined to not schedule a hearing at \n11  this time . . . .”2   \n12  DISCUSSION \n13    The issues raised here overlap significantly with the issues raised in the preliminary \n14  injunction briefing in San Carlos and AMRC.  In the interest of brevity, the Court thus \n15  incorporates, by reference, the analysis set forth in the August 15, 2025 order concerning \n16  the applicable standards, the unique features of SALECA, and the complexities raised by \n17  Defendants’ jurisdictional and threshold challenges. \n18  I.  The First Winter Factor \n19    As discussed in the August 15, 2025 order, the first Winter factor addresses whether \n20  Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits or at least serious questions \n21  going to the merits. \n22    A.  RFRA And Free Exercise Claims \n23    Plaintiffs’  first  argument  is  that  they  are  likely  to  succeed  on  a  RFRA-based \n24  challenge to the land exchange.  (Doc. 15-1 at 16-23.)  Plaintiffs’ supporting arguments \n25  rest on the premise that “the en banc majority’s” RFRA analysis in Apache Stronghold was \n26 \n \n27  2   To that end, the Court had hoped to finalize and issue this order by August 15, 2025, \nconcurrently with the order in San Carlos and AMRC, and made substantial efforts to do \n28  so.  Unfortunately, due to the complexity and sheer volume of the number of issues raised \nin those two cases and in this case, the finalization of this order took some extra time. \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 8 of 20\n \n \n \n1  wrong.  (Id.)  Likewise, in their reply, Plaintiffs cite “Justices Gorsuch and Thomas’s \n2  persuasive criticism of Apache Stronghold’s substantial-burden holding” and argue that \n3  Apache Stronghold’s RFRA analysis “should be rejected by the Ninth Circuit or the \n4  Supreme Court.”  (Doc. 40 at 6-7.) \n5  Whatever force those arguments may have had when this action was pending in the \n6  District of Columbia (and thus governed by the law of the D.C. Circuit), they are unavailing \n7  now that it has been transferred to the District of Arizona (and thus governed by the law of \n8  the Ninth Circuit).  In Apache Stronghold, the Ninth Circuit rejected—albeit by a narrow \n9  margin—a RFRA-based challenge to the land exchange that is effectively the same as the \n10  RFRA-based challenge being advanced here.  It may be true, as Plaintiffs emphasize, that \n11  “six federal appellate judges and two Supreme Court Justices” have disagreed with the \n12  majority’s RFRA analysis (Doc. 15-1 at 19), but it still represents the law of the Ninth \n13  Circuit.  Accordingly, it is binding here.  Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., 663 F.2d 930, 933 \n14  (9th Cir. 1981) (“District courts are bound by the law of their own circuit . . . no matter \n15  how egregiously in error they may feel their own circuit to be.”). \n16    Plaintiffs’ second argument is that they are likely to succeed on a challenge under \n17  the Free Exercise Clause.  (Doc. 15-1 at 24-27.)  This argument is once again foreclosed \n18  by Ninth Circuit law, as Apache Stronghold held—albeit once again by a slim margin—\n19  that the plaintiff had “no likelihood of success on its Free Exercise claim.”  Apache \n20  Stronghold, 101 F.4th at 1055.  In support, the court cited “the Supreme Court’s controlling \n21  decision in” Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association, 485 U.S. (1988).  \n22  Id. at 1049.  The court concluded that “[t]he project challenged here is indistinguishable \n23  from that in Lyng.”  Id. at 1051. \n24  In their reply, Plaintiffs contend that Apache Stronghold’s Free Exercise analysis is \n25  no longer good law in light of the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Mahmoud v. \n26  Taylor, 145 S. Ct. 2332 (2025).  (Doc. 40 at 9-11.)  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on \n27  this argument.  In the Ninth Circuit, “a district court or a three-judge panel” is only “free \n28  to reexamine the holding of a prior panel in light of an inconsistent decision by a court of \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 9 of 20\n \n \n \n1  last resort” when “the relevant court of last resort [has] undercut the theory or reasoning \n2  underlying  the  prior  circuit  precedent  in  such  a  way  that  the  cases  are  clearly \n3  irreconcilable.”  Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc).  As \n4  Defendants correctly point out (Doc. 33 at 11-12; Doc. 38 at 9-11), Mahmoud likely does \n5  not satisfy this demanding “clearly irreconcilable” standard for a host of reasons, including \n6  that Mahmoud did not purport to overrule or limit Lyng.  Mahmoud, 145 S. Ct. at 2356-57 \n7  (“We are also unpersuaded by the Board’s reliance . . . on our decisions in [Bowen] and \n8  Lyng . . . .  These cases have no application here.”).3 \n9  Given these conclusions, it is unnecessary to address Defendants’ other bases for \n10  challenging Plaintiffs’ RFRA and Free Exercise claims.  In light of Apache Stronghold, \n11  Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood of success on those claims or even serious \n12  questions going to the merits of those claims. \n13    B.  NEPA Claims \n14  Plaintiffs’ third argument is that the FEIS “violates NEPA in two respects: (1) it \n15  exceeds NEPA’s clear length limit; and (2) it fails to comply with NEPA’s requirement to \n16  consider reasonable alternatives.”  (Doc. 15-1 at 28.) \n17    1.  Page Limit \n18  As a threshold matter, although the Court concluded in the August 15, 2025 order \n19  that none of the NEPA-related challenges in San Carlos and AMRC were likely to satisfy \n20  the “final agency action” requirement, the analysis as to Plaintiffs’ page-limit challenge \n21  may be different.  The Forest Service has now made a final decision regarding the length \n22  of the FEIS, and that particular decision is not tentative or subject to revision in the final \n23  record of decision (“ROD”).   \n24  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their page-limit \n25  challenge.  As background, in 2023, as part of the Building U.S. Infrastructure through \n26 \n \n27  3   As noted in earlier portions of this order, there is a pending GVR request before the \nSupreme Court in Apache Stronghold that is premised on Mahmoud.  This Court obviously \n28  expresses no opinion on how the Supreme Court will or should resolve that request and \nconfines its analysis to the limited “clearly irreconcilable” inquiry contemplated by Miller. \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 10 of 20\n \n \n \n1  Limited Delays & Efficient Reviews (“BUILDER”) Act, Congress amended NEPA in \n2  various ways.  One of the new provisions enacted as part of the BUILDER Act provides as \n3  follows:  \n4 \n(e)  Page Limits \n5 \n(1)  Environmental impact statements \n6 \n(A)   In general \n7 \nExcept as provided in subparagraph (B), an environmental \n8 \nimpact statement shall not exceed 150 pages, not including any \n9  citations or appendices. \n10  (B)   Extraordinary complexity \n11 \nAn environmental impact statement for a proposed agency \n12  action of extraordinary complexity shall not exceed 300 pages, \nnot including any citations or appendices. \n13 \n42 U.S.C. § 4336a(e).  Recently, the Supreme Court cited this provision when explaining \n14 \nthat “federal law now strictly prohibits an agency’s EIS from going on endlessly.”  Seven \n15 \nCnty. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cnty., Colorado, 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1512 n.3 (2025). \n16 \n  Plaintiffs contend the FEIS violates § 4336a(e) because it includes 1,010 pages of \n17 \nsubstantive text, not including appendices.  (Doc. 15-1 at 28.)  Defendants respond that       \n18 \n§  4336a(e)  is  inapplicable  because  the  FEIS  preparation-process  began  long  before                 \n19 \n§ 4336a(e) was enacted and statutes ordinarily apply only prospectively.  (Doc. 33 at 12-\n20 \n13; Doc. 38 at 18-19.)  Resolution Copper further notes that, under the Department of \n21 \nAgriculture’s regulations, the new procedural limitations enacted as part of the BUILDER \n22 \nAct only apply to new projects or projects in the early stage of development: “USDA \n23 \nsubcomponents also have the discretion to begin applying the USDA NEPA regulations, \n24 \nas revised, effective immediately upon publication of this interim final rule where it makes \n25 \nsense to do so for new proposals and applications, or for existing proposals or applications \n26 \nthat are in the early stages of the applicable NEPA process and can easily transition to using \n27 \nthe revised USDA NEPA regulations.”  90 Fed. Reg. 29,632, 29,644 (July 3, 2025). \n28 \n  It  is  unclear  whether  §  4336a(e)  applies  here.    Although  the  canon  against \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 11 of 20\n \n \n \n1  retroactivity  is  likely  inapplicable  for  the  reasons  identified  in  Plaintiffs’  reply—as \n2  Plaintiffs note, “if a provision is . . . procedural, a presumption in favor of retroactive \n3  application attaches,” Chenault v. USPS, 37 F.3d 535, 538 (9th Cir. 1994)—it must not be \n4  overlooked that the unique form of FEIS required by SALECA differs from the sort of \n5  FEIS ordinarily contemplated by NEPA.  As discussed in more detail in the August 15, \n6  2025 order, SALECA expressly required the Forest Service to address certain topics in the \n7  FEIS  in  addition  to  environmental  consequences.    16  U.S.C.  §  539p(c)(9)(C)  (“The \n8  environmental impact statement prepared under subparagraph (B) shall . . . assess the \n9  effects of the mining and related activities on the Federal land conveyed to Resolution \n10  Copper under this section on the cultural and archeological resources that may be located \non the Federal land; and . . . identify measures that may be taken, to the extent practicable, \n11 \nto minimize potential adverse impacts on those resources, if any.”).  The Ninth Circuit has \n12 \nrecognized that the FEIS required by SALECA is thus more expansive than an ordinary \n13 \nFEIS: “Congress supplemented the ordinary NEPA requirements for such statements and \n14 \nrequired that the EIS for the land transfer also ‘assess the effect of the mining’ on ‘cultural \n15 \nand archeological resources’ in the area and ‘identify measures . . . to minimize potential \n16 \nadverse impacts on those resources.’”  Apache Stronghold, 101 F.4th at 1047 (emphasis \n17 \nadded).  If SALECA requires the Forest Service to prepare a FEIS that covers additional \n18 \ntopics beyond the topics ordinarily addressed in a FEIS, it stands to reason that the usual \n19 \npage limits applicable to FEISs may not be applicable here.4 \n20 \n  Yet even assuming that the page limits specified in § 4336a(e) applied and that the \n21 \nForest  Service  violated  those  limits,  the  Court  agrees  with  the  Federal  Defendants’ \n22 \nassertion  that  Plaintiffs  likely  cannot  show  “they  were  injured  by  receiving  more \n23 \ninformation than they were otherwise entitled to.”  (Doc. 33 at 13.)  “The APA directs us \n24 \nto take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. . . .  The harmless-error analysis asks \n25 \nwhether the [agency’s failure] materially impeded NEPA’s goals—that is, whether the \n26 \n27   \n4   In a related vein, SALECA places a qualification on the Forest Service’s obligation \n28  to “carry out the land exchange in accordance with [NEPA],” providing that this obligation \nis “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section.”  16 U.S.C. § 539p(c)(9)(A).     \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 12 of 20\n \n \n \n1  error caused the agency not to be fully aware of the environmental consequences of the \n2  proposed action, thereby precluding informed decisionmaking and public participation, or \n3  otherwise  materially  affected  the  substance  of  the  agency’s  decision.”    Idaho  Wool \n4  Growers  Ass’n  v.  Vilsack,  816  F.3d  1095,  1104  (9th  Cir.  2016).    See  also  Laguna \n5  Greenbelt, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 42 F.3d 517, 527 (9th Cir. 1994), as amended on \n6  denial of reh’g (1994) (“In determining whether NEPA has been violated, we must look to \n7  the ultimate harm NEPA seeks to prevent: the risk of damage to the environment that \n8  results if the agency fails to properly and thoroughly evaluate the environmental impacts \n9  of a proposed project.”). \n10    In Ground Zero Ctr. for Non-Violent Action v. United States Dep’t of Navy, 860 \nF.3d 1244 (9th Cir. 2017), the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to stop the Navy \n11 \nfrom building an “explosives handling wharf” for maintenance of submarines and nuclear \n12 \nmissiles.  Id. at 1248-49.  “[T]he Navy prepared and published an EIS,” which “[a]t several \n13 \npoints . . . referenced appendices.”  Id.  However, “[t]hree of these appendices were \n14 \nredacted in their entirety in the publicly released version of the EIS.”  Id.  During litigation, \n15 \nthe appendices were later disclosed, but the initial “failure to disclose the . . . appendix \n16 \ninformation violated NEPA,” which requires “disclosure to the fullest extent possible.”  Id. \n17 \nat 1252 (cleaned up).  “Nevertheless,” the Ninth Circuit concluded that “the Navy’s failure \n18 \nto disclose the portions of the appendices at issue was harmless error” because the plaintiffs \n19 \nhad “not specified any information in the now-revealed portions of [the appendices] that \n20 \nwould  have  made  a  difference  in  agency  decisionmaking  or  public  participation”  or \n21 \notherwise “demonstrated that NEPA’s goals were materially impeded.”  Id.at 1253.   \n22 \nHere, too, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how the publishing of a shorter FEIS \n23 \nwould have made a difference in the agency decisionmaking or otherwise impede NEPA’s \n24 \ngoals.  Plaintiffs argue that the overly-long FEIS caused harm by “giving [them] only 60 \n25 \ndays  to  digest  and  challenge  the  content  of  a  flood-the-zone  EIS”  and  “effectively \n26 \nstripp[ing] [them] of their right to receive ‘assurance that the agency has indeed considered \n27 \nenvironmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.’”  (Doc. 40 at 12-13.)  To support \n28 \nthis argument, Plaintiffs cite Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 \n \n- 12 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 13 of 20\n \n \n \n1  (1989).  The full quote from Robertson reads:  \n2 \nPublication of an EIS, both in draft and final form, also serves a larger \n3 \ninformational role.  It gives the public the assurance that the agency has \n4  indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process \nand, perhaps more significantly, provides a springboard for public comment.  \n5 \nThus, in this case the final draft of the Early Winters Study reflects not only \nthe work of the Forest Service itself, but also the critical views of the \n6 \nWashington  State  Department  of  Game,  the  Methow  Valley  Citizens \n7 \nCouncil, and Friends of the Earth, as well as many others, to whom copies of \nthe draft Study were circulated. \n8 \n9 \nId. at 349 (cleaned up). \n10 \nAlthough Robertson broadly supports the notion that NEPA’s purpose is to facilitate \n11 \n“public participation,” it does not support Plaintiffs’ argument that NEPA is intended to \n12 \nexpedite and enable emergency litigation.  Instead, Robertson suggests that the type of \n13 \n“public participation” envisioned by NEPA is public access to information and “public \n14 \ncomment.”  In this case, the Forest Service provided both.5 \n15 \nIt is also important to take stock of other provisions of the BUILDER Act, passed \n16 \nalongside the new page limits, when assessing how those page limits intersect with NEPA’s \n17 \nbroader goals and purposes.  For example, the new § 4336a(g) provides that: \n18 \n(1)   In general \n19 \nExcept as provided in paragraph (2), with respect to a proposed agency action, a \n20 \nlead agency shall complete, as applicable— \n21 \n(A)   the environmental impact statement not later than the date that is 2 \n22  years after the sooner of, as applicable— \n23 \n(i)   the  date  on  which  such  agency  determines  that  section \n24   \n5   Further, as Resolution Copper points out: “Plaintiffs’ assertion that the lengthy EIS \n25  is too long for the public to tackle . . . ignores the 32 page executive summary that captures \nthe essence of the entire study.”  (Doc. 38 at 19.)  This argument also supports a finding of \n26  harmless error.  Despite the voluminous nature of the FEIS, Plaintiffs here (as well as the \nplaintiffs in San Carlos and AMRC) were still able to seek relief and the Court was still \n27  able to review their challenges within the 60-day statutory window.  Plaintiffs’ contrary \nargument places form over function and fails to explain how a 300-page EIS with 3,000 \n28  pages of appendices—as permitted by the statute—would be materially different from the \ndocument provided here.   \n \n- 13 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 14 of 20\n \n \n \n1  4332(2)(C)  of  this  title  requires  the  issuance  of  an \nenvironmental impact statement with respect to such action; \n2 \n3  (ii)   the date on which such agency notifies the applicant that the \napplication  to  establish  a  right-of-way  for  such  action  is \n4 \ncomplete; and \n5 \n(iii)   the date on which such agency issues a notice of intent to \n6  prepare the environmental impact statement for such action; \nand \n7 \n. . .  \n8 \n9  (2)   Delay \n10  A lead agency that determines it is not able to meet the deadline described in \nparagraph (1) may extend such deadline, in consultation with the applicant, to \n11 \nestablish a new deadline that provides only so much additional time as is necessary \n12  to complete such environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. \n13 \n42 U.S.C. § 4336a(g).  This provision suggests the new page limits are part of a broader \n14 \neffort to expedite the EIS process.  Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, 145 S. Ct. at \n15 \n1512 n.3 (“Under that BUILDER Act, an EIS shall not exceed 150 pages and must be \n16 \ncompleted in 2 years or less.  That Act strongly reinforces the basic principles that NEPA, \n17 \ncorrectly interpreted, already embodied but that have been too often overlooked.”) (cleaned \n18 \nup).  The remedy that Plaintiffs seek here—vacating the FEIS so the Forest Service can \n19 \ncraft a new version of that document that is simply shorter in length—would not advance \n20 \nthat goal. \n21 \n  For these reasons, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their page-limit challenge. \n22 \n  2.  Alternative Mining Methods \n23 \nThe other alleged NEPA violation raised by Plaintiffs is that the FEIS “neglected to \n24 \nstudy, develop, and describe . . . the technically and economically feasible alternatives to \n25 \nturning Oak Flat into a crater.”  (Doc. 15-1 at 28, cleaned up.)  More specifically, Plaintiffs \n26 \nfault the Forest Service for uncritically accepting Resolution Copper’s proposed mining \n27 \nmethod without considering and analyzing alternative mining methods that might be less \n28 \ndestructive.  (Id. at 28-30.)  Plaintiffs also contend the FEIS is internally inconsistent on \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 15 of 20\n \n \n \n1  why the Forest Service accepted this mining method, stating at times that the decision was \n2  intended to boost Resolution Copper’s profits and productivity but stating at other times \n3  that the agency “did not factor profitability into the analysis.”  (Id.) \n4  This challenge is unlikely to succeed on the merits.  As an initial matter, the Federal \n5  Defendants argue that because the Forest Service lacks authority to regulate the mining \n6  operations that will occur on private land following the land exchange, the Forest Service \n7  was not required to provide any analysis in the FEIS of the environmental consequences \n8  of the mining methods that Resolution Copper may use as part of those operations or any \n9  analysis of alternative mining methods.  (Doc. 33 at 13.)  Plaintiffs’ reply does not appear \n10  to address or dispute this point.  Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, 145 S. Ct. at 1516 \n11  (“[A]gencies are not required to analyze the effects of projects over which they do not \n12  exercise regulatory authority.”).  The Forest Service also emphasized this point in the \n13  DROD.  (AMRC, Doc. 94-2 at 16 [DROD page 5: “Mining operations within the area \n14  conveyed by the Forest Service in the exchange are not subject to regulation by the Forest \n15  Service . . . .].)   \n16  Moreover, even if the Forest Service’s evaluation of alternative mining methods \n17  could somehow affect the Forest Service’s discretionary decisions as to other matters (such \n18  as decisions regarding pipelines, permits, and the like), the Forest Service still has not made \n19  any final decisions regarding those matters, which will eventually be set forth in the ROD.  \n20  As a result, any challenge along those lines would likely fail based on the absence of “final \n21  agency action,” as explained in more detail in the August 15, 2025 order.   \n22  Finally,  putting  aside  those  obstacles,  Plaintiffs’  substantive  criticisms  of  the \n23  portions of the FEIS discussing alternative mining methods6 are unlikely to succeed on the \n24  merits.  In the FEIS, the Forest Service explained that it had “received detailed comments \n25  on our assessment of alternative mining techniques other than block caving; the most \n26  commonly noted was cut-and-fill mining. . . .  Ultimately, we confirmed our decision to \n27   \n6   Although the Forest Service may not have been required, for the reasons stated \n28  above, to assess the environmental consequences of alternative mining methods, it still \nchose to do so.   \n \n- 15 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 16 of 20\n \n \n \n1  dismiss alternative mining techniques from detailed analysis.  Almost all industry mining \n2  guidance indicates alternative mining techniques are not appropriate for a deposit like the \n3  Resolution Copper deposit, and the trade-offs are unreasonable.  However, we added \n4  further description here due to the interest in this topic.”  (San Carlos, Doc. 105-9 at 95 \n5  [FEIS page 50.].)  The Forest Service continued:  \n6 \nBased on review of industry guidance for selection of mining methods, block \n7  caving is the standard mining method used in the industry for ore bodies with \nthe  grade,  size,  depth,  and  geological  characteristics  of  the  Resolution \n8 \nCopper deposit.  The ore and host rock characteristics that are favorable to \nother underground techniques differ from the Resolution Copper deposit.  \n9 \nWhile physically almost any technique could be undertaken, it is unlikely \n10  that  any  of  these  other  underground  techniques  would  be  chosen  as  a \nreasonable technique for a similar deposit. \n11 \n12  Aside from appropriateness when compared to industry standards, use of any \nof these alternative underground mining techniques would result in higher \n13 \nper-ton mining costs, and as a result the cutoff grade for the deposit would \n14  need to be higher to be economically feasible.  An increase in the cutoff grade \nfrom 1 percent to 2 percent removes an estimated 80 percent of the tonnage \n15 \nof the Resolution Copper deposit from consideration for development.  The \ntonnage is likely to be even lower at a 2 percent cutoff grade, as many of \n16 \nthese areas of high-grade ore are not contiguous or continuous.  We found \n17  that accepting this level of reduction to accommodate an alternative mining \ntechnique is not economically feasible and would be unreasonable. \n18 \n19  Based on public comments, the primary misunderstanding is that the decision \nnot to analyze alternative mining techniques is based on profit, and that we \n20 \nare prioritizing profitability over environmental protection.  This is not the \n21  case.  Analysis of profitability of the mine was not conducted, and does not \nfactor into the NEPA analysis or the determination of alternatives.  Rather, \n22 \nour decision is based on what is reasonable under regulations and policy.  We \nfound  that  forgoing  80  percent  of  the  ore  deposit  to  accommodate  an \n23 \nalternative mining technique is an unreasonable outcome. \n24 \n25  (Id. at 95-96 [FEIS pages 50-51].)   \n26  In Appendix F to the FEIS, the Forest Service provided further technical analysis of \n27  these topics.  (San Carlos, Doc. 107-3 at 224-27 [FEIS pages F-2 through F-5.].)  That \n28  analysis cross-referenced and discussed various studies, including the “Resolution Copper \n \n- 16 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 17 of 20\n \n \n \n1  Project and Land Exchange Environmental Impact Statement Final Alternatives Evaluation \n2  Report (SWCA Environmental Consultants 20l7a).”  (Id. at 225 [FEIS page F-3].) \n3    For these reasons, it is evident that the Forest Service took the sort of “hard look” \n4  at alternative mining methods that, to the extent any such analysis was even required here, \n5  would be sufficient under NEPA.   Although Plaintiffs may disagree with the Forest \n6  Service’s  conclusions  regarding  the  feasibility  of  those  alternative  mining  methods, \n7  “[b]lack-letter administrative law instructs that when an agency makes those kinds of . . . \n8  predictive or scientific judgments, and decides what qualifies as . . . feasible or the like, a \n9  reviewing court must be at its ‘most deferential.’”  Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, \n10  145 S. Ct. at 1512.  Courts must also resist the urge to “fly-speck” the agency’s analysis \n11  and “act[] as a type of omnipotent scientist.”  Audubon Society of Portland v. Haaland, 240 \n12  F.4th 967, 984 (9th Cir. 2022).  In a related vein, it fell within NEPA’s “broad zone of \n13  reasonableness,” Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, 145 S. Ct. at 1513, for the Forest \n14  Service to consider the cost and productivity of the alternative mining methods when \n15  assessing their feasibility.  Such consideration was particularly reasonable here because \n16  Congress indicated in SALECA that it expected the land exchange to result in “the \n17  extraction  of  minerals  in  commercial  quantities  by  Resolution  Copper.”    16  U.S.C.                 \n18  § 539p(c)(9)(D)(ii).  Plaintiffs may be correct that “Congress said nothing about how much \n19  copper the project should provide” and did not “inten[d] to maximize Resolution’s bottom \n20  line” (Doc. 40 at 13), but it was still reasonable for the Forest Service to consider, as part \n21  of the feasibility analysis, the cost and productivity of alternative mining methods and how \n22  those considerations would affect the mine’s output and productivity.  Cf. Robertson, 490 \n23  U.S. at 350-51 (“If the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately \n24  identified and evaluated, the agency is not constrained by NEPA from deciding that other \n25  values outweigh the environmental costs.  In this case, for example, it would not have \n26  violated  NEPA  if  the  Forest  Service,  after  complying  with  the  Act’s  procedural \n27  prerequisites, had decided that the benefits to be derived from downhill skiing at Sandy \n28  Butte justified the issuance of a special use permit, notwithstanding the loss of 15 percent, \n \n- 17 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 18 of 20\n \n \n \n1  50 percent, or even 100 percent of the mule deer herd.”). \n2  C.  Consultation Claim \n3  Plaintiffs’ final argument is that the Forest Service violated its consultation duties \n4  under § 106 of NHPA by failing to address certain mitigation measures proposed by ACHP, \n5  including “the specific suggestion of incentivizing alternate mining techniques that would \n6  prevent the crater from destroying the land at Oak Flat.”  (Doc. 15-1 at 30-32.) \n7  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on this claim.  As discussed in the August 15, 2025 \n8  order, the Forest Service consulted extensively with ACHP before ACHP terminated the \n9  consultations in February 2021.  The Secretary of Agriculture also provided a detailed \n10  written response in April 2025 to the post-termination comments that ACHP transmitted \n11  in March 2021.   \n12  Plaintiffs focus on ACHP’s second comment, which encouraged the Department of \n13  Agriculture to “use further discussions with Indian tribes and other stakeholders to develop \n14  and evaluate alternatives and further modifications to the undertaking that might avoid \n15  adverse effects while also pursuing additional steps to modify or prevent the land transfer” \n16  and then identified several areas of recommended emphasis, including “a reassessment of \n17  alternative and more sustainable mining techniques in an effort to prevent subsidence at \n18  Oak Flat.”  (San Carlos, Doc. 109-5 at 8.)  In the portion of the April 2025 letter responding \n19  to ACHP’s second comment, the Secretary of Agriculture provided four lengthy, single-\n20  spaced paragraphs.  (San Carlos, Doc. 82-15 at 3-4.)  The final paragraph reads: “It is also \n21  important to recognize that SALECA limits the authority the USDA will have over most \n22  elements of the  proposed Resolution  Copper Mine (RCM)  because once the land is \n23  exchanged, the project will be almost entirely on private land.”  (Id. at 4.)  Read in proper \n24  context, this is a response to ACHP’s earlier comment about pursuing alternative mining \n25  methods—as discussed in the preceding section of this order, the Forest Service lacks \n26  authority to compel Resolution Copper to utilize a particular mining method once the land \n27  exchange is completed.   \n28  As discussed in greater detail  in the August 15, 2025 order, it follows that the Forest \n \n- 18 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 19 of 20\n \n \n \n1  Service likely did all that is required under § 106: it “demonstrate[d]” via the April 2025 \n2  letter that “it ha[d] read and considered” ACHP’s comments and “gave the ACHP’s \n3  conclusion genuine attention.”  Concerned Citizens All., Inc. v. Slater, 176 F.3d 686, 696 \n4  (3d Cir. 1999).   \n5  II.  The Remaining Winter Factors \n6    The remainder of the preliminary injunction analysis mirrors the analysis set forth \n7  in Parts II, III, and IV of the August 15, 2025 order, which is incorporated by reference \n8  here.  More specifically, (1) the analysis need not go any further in light of Plaintiffs’ failure \n9  to satisfy the first Winter factor; and (2) even if Plaintiffs had established serious questions \n10  going to the merits, the Court would deny injunctive relief based on the remaining Winter \n11  factors—although Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary \n12  injunction, the public interest does not tip sharply in their favor (nor does the balance of \n13  equities). \n14  III.  Request For Injunction Pending Appeal \n15    Plaintiffs’ alternative request for an injunction pending appeal (Doc. 43) is denied \n16  for the same reasons as the requests for an injunction pending appeal in San Carlos and \n17  AMRC (as discussed in Part V of the August 15, 2025 order).  Although this is an important \n18  case of an unusual magnitude, involves sympathetic Plaintiffs, and raises some compelling \n19  equities, the Court does not construe Rule 62(d) as authorizing an injunction pending \n20  appeal  absent  a  stronger  showing  on  the  merits.    For  similar  reasons,  the  Court  is \n21  unpersuaded that it would be appropriate to “enter a limited, 14-day stay . . . to give the \n22  Ninth Circuit an opportunity to address Plaintiffs’ request for an emergency injunction on \n23  a less time-compressed time schedule.”  (Doc. 43 at 2.)  Granting that relief would \n24  effectively be granting a TRO, and the standard for granting a TRO is simply not met here.   \n25  It is unfortunate that Plaintiffs will have very little time to seek emergency relief \n26  from the Ninth Circuit before the land exchange is scheduled to occur on August 19, 2025 \n27  (and the judges of the Ninth Circuit will have even less time to consider that request), but \n28  the Court has made extensive efforts to resolve the oversized preliminary injunction motion \n \n- 19 - \n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-02758-DWL     Document 45     Filed 08/17/25     Page 20 of 20\n \n \n \n1  in  this  case  (as  well  as  the  two  oversized  motions  in  San  Carlos  and  AMRC)  as \n2  expeditiously as possible so there is at least some period of time for the Ninth Circuit to \n3  consider these issues. \n4    Accordingly, \n5    IT IS ORDERED that: \n6    1.  Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 15) is denied. \n7    2.  Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction pending appeal (Doc. 43) is denied. \n8    Dated this 17th day of August, 2025. \n9   \n \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 20 - ",

This case involves the federal government’s plan to destroy a long-recognized Native \nAmerican sacred site in violation of federal statutes and the Constitution. Plaintiffs are Apache \ngirls and women who worship at that site and will be unable to practice and pass down their religion \nif the site is destroyed. Because the government’s plan to destroy the site goes into effect in just \n26 days, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction by August 15, 2025. \n2.  For centuries, Western Apaches have worshipped at a sacred site called Chí’chil Biłda-\ngoteel, or Oak Flat. Oak Flat is the Apaches’ direct corridor to the Creator and the locus of sacred \nrituals that are uniquely tied to that place and cannot be replicated elsewhere.  \n3.  Since the mid-1900s, the government has recognized the significance of Oak Flat, \npreserving it from mining and protecting Apache rituals that take place there. But because a large \ncopper deposit was discovered beneath Oak Flat, the government has now decided to transfer the \nsite to Resolution Copper, a foreign-owned mining company, for the express purpose of creating \na mine that will destroy the site—swallowing it in a massive crater and ending sacred Apache \nrituals forever. \n4.  The government admits that the mine will physically destroy Oak Flat: the impacts will \nbe “immediate, permanent, and large in scale”; all “public access” to the site will be “lost”; nothing \ncan “replace or replicate the tribal resources and [traditional cultural properties] that would be \ndestroyed”; and Apaches will never again be able to carry out their religious practices at Oak Flat. \nUSDA, 3 Final Environmental Impact Statement: Resolution Copper Project & Land Exchange \n892 (June 2025) (i.e., 3-EIS-892), https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/documents/final-eis; 1-EIS-\n153, 327. \n5.  The government also admits that “alternative underground mining methods” “could \nphysically be applied” to recover the copper without cratering the surface of Oak Flat. 4-EIS-F-3. \nHowever, the government has declined to require these alternatives, or even consider them, based \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 4 of 26\n   \n \non Resolution’s claim that these alternatives would have “higher operational costs” and “reduce \nthe amount of ore that could be profitably mined.” Id. \n6.  In other words, the government has authorized the complete physical destruction of an \nirreplaceable Native American sacred site solely to pad the bottom line of a foreign-owned mining \ncompany. \n7.  On June 20, 2025, the Forest Service published its Final Environmental Impact Statement \n(EIS) for the proposed mine—the final agency action setting in motion the transfer and destruction \nof Oak Flat. Publication of the EIS triggers a 60-day deadline for the government to transfer title \nto Oak Flat to Resolution, which the government plans to do, absent judicial intervention, on \nAugust 19, 2025. Resolution can then immediately begin degrading the surface of Oak Flat. \n8.  As explained below, the government’s decision to transfer and destroy Oak Flat violates \nmultiple federal laws and the Constitution. \n9.  First, it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). RFRA provides that the \nfederal government may not “substantially burden” a person’s  religious exercise unless the \ngovernment demonstrates that imposing that burden is “the least restrictive means of furthering” a \n“compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a), (b). By its terms, RFRA applies to \n“all Federal law,” id. § 2000bb-3(a), including laws disposing of federal real property, and it \nexpressly defines the “exercise of religion” to include “[t]he use … of real property for the purpose \nof religious exercise,” id. §§ 2000bb-2, 2000cc-5(7)(B). Six federal appellate judges and two \nSupreme Court Justices have already opined that destroying Oak Flat would substantially burden \nWestern Apaches’ religious exercise. See Apache Stronghold v. United States, 145 S. Ct. 1480, \n1480 (2025) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (citing Apache Stronghold v. United \nStates, 101 F.4th 1036, 1131 (9th Cir. 2024) (en banc) (Murguia, C.J., dissenting)); Apache \nStronghold v. United States, No. 21-15295, 2021 WL 12295173 (9th Cir. Mar. 5, 2021) (Bumatay, \nJ., dissenting). Over the course of years of defending the land transfer, the government has never \neven attempted to show that destroying Oak Flat is the least restrictive means of furthering a \ncompelling governmental interest. Thus, the destruction of Oak Flat violates RFRA. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 5 of 26\n   \n \n10.  Second, the destruction of Oak Flat violates the First Amendment right of Apache parents \nto direct the religious upbringing of their children. In Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Supreme Court held \nthat “the right of parents ‘to direct the religious upbringing of their’ children would be an empty \npromise if it did not follow those children” onto government property. 145 S. Ct. 2332, 2351 \n(2025). Accordingly, the Court held that reading LGBTQ-inclusive storybooks to children in \npublic schools, without notifying parents or allowing the children to opt out, posed “‘a very real \nthreat of undermining’ the religious beliefs that the parents wish to instill in their children.” Id. at \n2355. Here, the government is not just “subtly” undermining what Apache parents seek to instill \nin their children, id. at 2353; it is destroying a sacred site that is uniquely irreplaceable and \nnecessary to the Apache faith, without which Apache parents will forever be prevented from \ninitiating their children in core Apache religious ways. This is nothing less than “the destruction \nof [a religious] community”—which all nine Justices in Mahmoud agreed was unconstitutional. \nId. at 2392 & n.8 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  \n11.  Third, the destruction of Oak Flat violates the Free Exercise Clause even aside from \nMahmoud, because the government’s actions are neither neutral toward religion nor based on a \ngenerally applicable law. Far from being the unanticipated, incidental effect of a religion-blind \nlaw, the government has made a calculated, discretionary, and individualized decision about a \nsingle piece of land—intentionally favoring the secular use of copper mining over religious use by \nApaches. That sort of discretionary decision to favor secular over religious conduct triggers strict \nscrutiny, which the government cannot satisfy. \n12.  Fourth,  the  EIS  violates  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA).  A  2023 \namendment to NEPA provides that an EIS “shall not exceed 150 pages,” except for projects of \n“extraordinary complexity,” in which case an EIS “shall not exceed 300 pages.” Here, the EIS is \nover 1,000 pages—plainly violating the statute. Even then, the EIS is also woefully underinclusive. \n42 U.S.C. § 4336a(e)(1)(A). While providing many pages of useless information, the EIS fails at \nthe most basic task of considering reasonable alternatives to the proposed agency action, including \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 6 of 26\n   \n \nalternative mining methods that would be far less destructive of Oak Flat. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(iii), \n(F). \n13.  Fifth, the transfer violates the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The NHPA \nrequires the government to identify historical sites that may be harmed by federal projects, and to \nmitigate and avoid harm to those sites. 54 U.S.C. § 306108; 36 C.F.R. § 800.1(a). Oak Flat is \nunquestionably a site of immeasurable historical value, as evidenced by (inter alia) its listing in \nthe National Register of Historic Places. Yet the government has failed to follow the processes set \nout in the NHPA. It has pushed the transfer forward without the support of the NHPA-created \nAdvisory Council on Historical Preservation (ACHP) and has ignored the alternative approaches \nsuggested by the ACHP that would prevent subsidence and mitigate harm to the 43 historical sites \nthat will be destroyed by the mine. This disregard for Oak Flat’s historical value violates the \nNHPA.  \n14.  This nation has a tragic history of destroying Apache lives and land for the sake of mining \ninterests. The history should not—indeed, must not—be repeated here. Multiple federal laws \nprotect Apache religious practices at Oak Flat. This Court should enforce those laws and enjoin \nthe transfer and destruction of Oak Flat. \nPARTIES \n15.  Plaintiff Gouyen Brown is an Apache woman who engages in religious practices at Oak \nFlat. She had her coming-of-age Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat, and Oak Flat is essential to her \nongoing religious exercise and her identity as an Apache woman.  \n16.  Plaintiff Sinetta Lopez is an Apache woman and mother who engages in religious \npractices at Oak Flat. Her adult daughter, Gouyen Brown, had her Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat. \nHer 11-year-old minor daughter also plans to have her Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat. Engaging \nin religious practices with her daughters at Oak Flat is essential to how she brings up her daughters \nin Apache religious ways. It is also essential to her own religious exercise and her identity as an \nApache woman. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 7 of 26\n   \n \n17.  Plaintiff  Nomie  Brown  is  an  Apache  woman  who  had  her  coming-of-age  Sunrise \nCeremony at Oak Flat. Oak Flat is essential to her ongoing religious exercise and her identity as \nan Apache woman. \n18.  Plaintiff Angela Kinsey is an Apache woman and mother who engages in religious \npractices at Oak Flat. Her seventeen-year-old minor daughter had her coming-of-age ceremony at \nOak Flat. She also hopes that her younger, four-year-old minor daughter can have her coming-of-\nage ceremony at Oak Flat. Engaging in religious practices with her daughters at Oak Flat is \nessential to how she brings up her daughters in Apache religious ways. It is also essential to her \nown religious exercise and her identity as an Apache woman. \n19.  Defendant United States of America (“United States” or “U.S.”) is being sued for the \nwrongful  acts  of  its  representatives,  employees,  and  agencies.  The  United  States  is  further \nimplicated by and through the actions, policies, patterns, practices, and customs of the other \nDefendants and its policymakers, agents, and officers. \n20.  Defendant United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) is the federal department \nresponsible for the management of the United States Forest Service  and national forests, including \nthe Tonto National Forest, in which Oak Flat lies. \n21.  Defendant United States Forest Service (“Forest Service”) is a federal agency of the \nUSDA. By statutory authority and the agency’s own regulations and policies, the Forest Service \nis also responsible for implementing the NHPA, NEPA, and other land management laws and \nregulations pertaining to actions and decisions about lands administered by Defendants. The Forest \nService has an obligation to consult and coordinate with Native American tribes and other \ngovernmental units when making findings and determinations under Section 106 of the NHPA \nregarding the effects of Forest Service-approved projects on cultural resources. Importantly, the \nForest Service has a fiduciary duty under the federal trust responsibility to consult and coordinate \nwith tribes and protect tribal properties, including traditional cultural properties and sacred sites, \nwhen approving and  assessing the effects of projects. Thus, the Forest Service is, by  law, \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 8 of 26\n   \n \nresponsible for the management and actions undertaken with respect to the public lands at issue \nhere. \n22.  Defendant Brooke Rollins is the Secretary of Agriculture and the chief officer for the \nUSDA. Rollins is responsible for the supervision of the Forest Service and the implementation and \nenforcement of applicable law in this proceeding. Rollins is sued in her official capacity. \n23.  Defendant Tom Schultz is the Chief of the Forest Service. Schultz is charged with the \nprimary duties and responsibilities of the United States and the Forest Service, and those as trustee \nand fiduciary regarding management of lands and other assets under Forest Service control or \nresponsibility. Schultz is sued in his official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n24.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367 because Plaintiffs’ claims arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n25.  Venue lies in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because it is a judicial district in \nwhich “a defendant in the action resides” and where “a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred.” \n26.  The challenged agency actions are subject to judicial review and authority pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 702, 704, 706. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nOak Flat \n27.  For centuries, Western Apaches and other tribes have worshipped at a sacred site called \nChí’chil Biłdagoteel (“a broad flat of Emory oak trees”) or Oak Flat. \n28.  Oak Flat is located within a 6.7-square-mile traditional cultural property about three miles \neast of present-day Superior, Arizona, between Apache Leap on the west and Ga’an Canyon (called \nDevil’s Canyon by non-Indians) on the east. \n29.  The terrain is characterized by old-growth oak groves, grassy basins, boulder fields, \njagged cliffs, and perennial waters used by songbirds, mountain lions, foxes, bears, and deer. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 9 of 26\n   \n \n30.  The  site  also  includes  sacred  springs,  burial  sites,  and  a  singular  concentration  of \narchaeological sites testifying to its persistent use for the past 1,500 years. \n31.  Sometimes described as the birthplace of Western Apache religion, Oak Flat figures \nprominently in Western Apache cosmology as a unique dwelling place of spiritual beings called \nGa’an, who are holy spirits and messengers between the Creator and human beings. \n32.  As the dwelling place of the Ga’an, Oak Flat is a direct corridor to the Creator and is \nuniquely endowed with holiness and medicine. As such, Oak Flat is the site of religious ceremonies \nthat are tied to that place and cannot be replicated elsewhere. \n33.  As one scholar has observed: “For centuries, Western Apaches have maintained close ties \nto [Oak Flat] as a place to collect traditional foods and medicines, a place of ancestral origins, a \nplace where holy beings reside, and the only place where certain prayers, offerings, and ceremonies \ncan be conducted.” Tisa Wenger, Fighting for Oak Flat: Western Apaches and American Religious \nFreedom, 39 J.L. AND RELIGION 247, 248 (2024) (“Wenger”). \n34.  Ceremonies that occur at Oak Flat include sweat lodge ceremonies for boys entering \nmanhood, Holy Ground Ceremonies for blessing and healing, the Sunrise Ceremony marking an \nApache girl’s entry into womanhood, and the gathering of sacred medicine plants, animals, and \nminerals essential to those ceremonies. \n35.  The Holy Ground Ceremony is a blessing and a healing ceremony that a medicine man \nconducts for people who are sick or seek guidance. It takes place at Oak Flat as a holy place for \nhealing, and it draws on holy medicinal plants available only at Oak Flat. It has been performed in \nits current form at Oak Flat for at least 100 years and reflects and builds on much older practices. \n36.  The Holy Ground Ceremony traces back at least to the 1920s and the Apache prophet \nSilas John, who drew on much older traditions. Silas John’s Holy Ground movement “very clearly \nincluded ceremonies at Chi’chil Biłdagoteel [Oak Flat].” Wenger at 257-58. By “selecting sites \nthat  Apaches  already  considered  sacred,  the  Holy  Ground  movement  secured  credibility  in \nIndigenous terms and deepened the sanctity of the places where its ceremonies were held.” Id. at \n259–60.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 10 of 26\n   \n \n37.  The federal government actively suppressed the Holy Ground movement by forbidding \nSilas John’s dances and jailing him. Id. at 259. Nevertheless, some families still held Holy Ground \nceremonies at Oak Flat in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Id. And they continue to do so today. \n38.  The Sunrise Ceremony requires months of planning, takes several days to celebrate, and \nis often attended by hundreds of tribal members. To prepare, the girl gathers plants from Oak Flat \nand speaks to the spirit of Oak Flat, expressing gratitude for its resources. Her godmother dresses \nher in the essential tools of womanhood, and tribal members surround her with singing, dancing, \nand prayer. In the night, the Ga’an enter Apache men called crown dancers. The Ga’an bless the \ngirl, who joins their dance. \n39.  On the final day, one of the Ga’an dancers paints the girl with white clay taken from the \nground at Oak Flat, molding her into the woman she is going to be. When her godmother wipes \nthe clay from her eyes, she is a new woman forever imprinted with the spirit of Oak Flat. \n40.  Oak Flat is also the site of several natural springs, which are rare in this arid region, and \nwhich are sources of spiritual power for Apaches. \n41.  One example is Tú Nahikaadi (Dripping Spring), a cave with a dripping spring, which \nhas a unique role in Apache oral tradition. \n42.  According to Apache tradition, a great flood scoured the world, and the matriarch of the \nApache people, Changing Woman, survived the flood and took refuge in a cave with a dripping \nspring. Wenger at 250–51. She emerged alone into this world, and her children, conceived with \nthe Sun, received guidance from the Ga’an on how to live in this land. Id. \n43.  Western Apaches continue to visit Dripping Spring for religious rituals, and the Apache \ngirl in a Sunrise Dance embodies Changing Woman as she dances her way to womanhood. \n44.  Oak Flat is also the site of Tséyaa Gogeschin (translated as Written or Painted under the \nRocks), a large rock overhang with ancient pictographs and petroglyphs—rock art that holds \nspecial meaning for Apache medicine people and provides a tangible, irreplaceable connection to \nApache ancestors. The Chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe has described this artwork as \n“the footprints and the very spirit of our ancestors,” akin to “the Western Wall in Jerusalem, St. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 11 of 26\n   \n \nPeter’s Basilica in Vatican City, or Angor [sic] Wat in Cambodia. This is why I call Oak Flat the \nSistine Chapel of Apache religion.” 6-EIS-U-9. \nPlaintiffs’ religious practices \n45.  The Plaintiffs in this case include Apache women and girls whose religious practices \ncenter on Oak Flat and who would be unable to continue their religious practices if Oak Flat is \ndestroyed. \n46.  Plaintiff Gouyen Brown had her Sunrise Ceremony at Oak Flat. During that ceremony, \nshe experienced a profound spiritual connection with the Creator, with the Ga’an, with Mother \nEarth, and with her ancestors. It is where she became a new woman. She continues to return to \nOak Flat to pray, gather medicine, and participate in religious ceremonies. She hopes and intends \nthat her own children will be able to connect with the Creator at Oak Flat, and that her daughters \nwill be able to have their Sunrise Ceremonies at Oak Flat. If Oak Flat is destroyed, she would be \ndevastated. She would be unable to continue core religious practices and unable to bring up her \nchildren in the Apache religious ways. \n47.  Plaintiff Sinetta Lopez is an Apache woman and Gouyen’s mother. She grew up coming \nto Oak Flat with her mother and grandmother, collecting acorns, praying, and participating in \nsacred ceremonies there. Oak Flat is central to her religious practices. As a single mother, Oak Flat \nis central to how she brings up her daughters in the Apache way. \n48.  Sinetta also has a minor daughter, L.B., who is named after an Apache warrior and \nprophet who escaped from imprisonment on the San Carlos Reservation and fought alongside \nGeronimo. Sinetta’s minor daughter has grown up at Oak Flat and has had dreams and encounters \nwith spirits at Oak Flat. She plans to have her Sunrise Ceremony there and remain connected with \nthe Creator and with her ancestors through sacred ceremonies at Oak Flat. \n49.  Plaintiff  Nomie  Brown  is  an  Apache  woman  who  had  her  coming-of-age  Sunrise \nCeremony at Oak Flat. That ceremony fundamentally changed her life, and she continues to return \nto Oak Flat to engage in prayer and religious ceremonies there. Oak Flat is essential to her ongoing \nreligious exercise and her identity as an Apache woman. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 12 of 26\n   \n \n50.  Plaintiff Angela Kinsey is an Apache woman and mother who engages in religious \npractices at Oak Flat. She grew up coming to Oak Flat with her grandmother and has participated \nin  many  religious  ceremonies  at  Oak  Flat,  including  serving  as  a  godmother  in  a  Sunrise \nCeremony. She has two minor daughters whom she continues to take to Oak Flat to show them \nwhere they came from and to pass on Apache traditions and religious ways. Oak Flat is the place \nwhere she is uniquely able to connect with the Creator. \n51.  Angela’s older minor daughter, V.K., had her coming-of-age ceremony at Oak Flat. She \nhas attended many ceremonies at Oak Flat, and attending and participating in those ceremonies is \nan essential part of her religious practices and identity as an Apache woman. \n52.  Angela’s younger minor daughter, M.K., is four years old. Angela hopes and intends that \nM.K. will be able to have her coming-of-age ceremony at Oak Flat. \n53.  For Plaintiffs, Oak Flat in its entirety is a sacred and holy site. Oak Flat’s protection is \nessential for the continued practice of Apache religious and cultural ways, and they oppose the \nplan to violate the integrity of Oak Flat through mining. \nThe government takes Oak Flat \n54.  Oak Flat was Apache land before the United States existed. \n55.  Beginning in the 1500s, other nations made claims on the area, including Spain and, later, \nMexico. \n56.  The United States first gained an interest in the area in 1848, after the Mexican-American \nWar, when Mexico ceded its claim to the area in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. \n57.  In 1852, to secure peace with the Apaches, the United States entered the Treaty of Santa \nFe with several Apache chiefs. In it, the United States promised to settle the Apaches’ territorial \nboundaries and pass and execute laws conducive to their prosperity and happiness. \n58.  Although the government failed to carry out its obligation to settle territorial boundaries \nformally, the earliest map of the area, prepared by the Smithsonian Institution in 1899, shows Oak \nFlat as Apache territory, not belonging to the United States. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 13 of 26\n   \n \n59.  Shortly  after  the  1852  Treaty,  settlers  and  miners  entered  the  area  over  Apache \nopposition, and U.S. soldiers and civilians repeatedly massacred Apaches. John R. Welch, Earth, \nWind, and Fire: Pinal Apaches, Miners, and Genocide in Central Arizona, 1859-1874, 7 SAGE \nOpen,  Oct.-Dec.  2017,  https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/2158244017747016  \n(“Welch”). \n60.  In 1862, U.S. Army General James Carleton ordered Apache men to be killed wherever \nfound. Id. at 7. \n61.  When miners discovered gold and silver nearby, General Carleton ordered the Apaches’ \n“removal to a Reservation” or “utter extermination” to protect “all those who go to the country in \nsearch of precious metals.” Id. at 8. \n62.  By 1874, the government had forced 4,000 Apaches onto the San Carlos Reservation—\nnicknamed “Hell’s 40 Acres” because it was a barren wasteland. \n63.  In 1883, the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs issued the Code of Indian Offenses, \nprohibiting traditional Native American religious practices on pain of imprisonment. Hiram Price, \nRules Governing the Court of Indian Offenses, Department of the Interior, Office of Indian Affairs, \nat 4–5 (Mar. 30, 1883). \n64.  The government also forcibly removed hundreds of Apache children from their families, \nsending them to boarding schools aimed at rooting out their “savagism” and converting them to \nChristianity. David Wallace Adams, Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding \nSchool Experience, 1875-1928 6 (1st ed. 1995). \n65.  After decades of conflict over their ancestral lands, the Chiricahua Apaches, led by \nGeronimo, surrendered in 1886 and agreed to be detained for two years in exchange for the return \nof their land. Gilbert King, Geronimo’s Appeal to Theodore Roosevelt, Smithsonian Magazine, \nNov.  9,  2012,  https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/geronimos-appeal-to-theodore-\nroosevelt-117859516/. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 14 of 26\n   \n \n66.  But the government broke this promise, too. Instead, it held them prisoner for 23 years \nand eventually confined them to the San Carlos Reservation. Native Voices, Timeline, 1886: \nApache armed resistance ends; Geronimo surrenders, U.S. National Library of Medicine. \n67.  The government admits that Oak Flat is “part of the traditional territories of the Western \nApache,” who “lived on and used the resources of these lands”; that the government took Oak Flat \n“by force 150 years ago”; and that because of the government’s actions, Western Apaches “lost \nlarge portions of their homelands, including Oak Flat, and today live on lands that do not \nencompass places sacred to their cultures.” 3-EIS-873–75. \n68.  Starting in the 1900s, the government took steps to protect Oak Flat. \n69.  In 1905, the government created the Tonto National Forest, which includes Oak Flat. \n70.  In 1955, President Eisenhower reserved part of Oak Flat to protect it from mining. 20 \nFed. Reg. 7319, 7336-37 (Oct. 1, 1955). \n71.  In 1971, President Nixon renewed the protection. 36 Fed. Reg. 18,997, 19,029 (Sep. 25, \n1971). \n72.  As recently as 2016, the National Park Service placed Oak Flat in the National Register \nof Historic Places, recognizing “that Chí’chil Biłdagoteel is an important feature of the Western \nApache landscape as a sacred site, as a source of supernatural power, and as a staple in their \ntraditional  lifeway.”  Chí’chil  Biłdagoteel  Historic  District,  Traditional  Cultural  Property, \nNational Register of Historic Places Registration Form (NPS Form 10-900) at 8, National Park \nService (Jan. 2016). \nResolution Copper lobbied for a land transfer \n73.  In 1995, a large copper deposit was discovered 4,500 to 7,000 feet beneath Oak Flat. \n74.  In 2004, two large multinational mining companies, Rio Tinto and BHP, formed a joint \nventure called Resolution Copper and began lobbying Congress to transfer Oak Flat so Resolution \ncould mine the deposit. \n75.  Between 2005 and 2013, Congress considered at least twelve standalone bills to transfer \nOak Flat to Resolution. Each failed. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 15 of 26\n   \n \n76.  Lacking congressional support for a standalone bill, Resolution and its allies tried a \ndifferent tack. \n77.  Each year, Congress passes the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which is \nnecessary legislation to fund the military. In 2014, the NDAA was 698 pages long and authorized \nhundreds of billions of dollars in defense spending. See Carl Levin and Howard P. “Buck” McKeon \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, 128 Stat. 3292. At the last minute, \nSenators McCain and Flake attached to that bill the land-transfer provision—called the “Southeast \nArizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act”—without a separate vote or debate. The land-\ntransfer provision then passed as Section 3003 of the NDAA. § 3003, 128 Stat. 3732–3741. \n78.  Section 3003 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer title to approximately \n2,422 acres of Forest Service lands, including Oak Flat, to Resolution, in exchange for other \nparcels of land owned by Resolution scattered elsewhere in Arizona. § 3003(b)(2), (b)(4), (c)(1), \n(d)(1), id., at 3732–3737. \n79.  Section 3003 also revokes the orders by Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon protecting Oak \nFlat. § 3003(i)(1)(A), id., at 3740. \n80.  Section 3003 instructs that, before conveying any federal land, the Secretary  must \n“prepare a single environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act \n[(NEPA)] which shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the \nproposed mine and the Resolution mine plan of operations and any related major Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment, including the granting of any permits, \nrights-of-way,  or  approvals  for  the  construction  of  associated  power,  water,  transportation, \nprocessing, tailings, waste disposal, or other ancillary facilities.” § 3003(c)(9)(B), id., at 3735–\n3736. \n81.  Section  3003  also  requires  the  Secretary  to  “engage  in  government-to-government \nconsultation with affected Indian tribes concerning issues of concern to the affected Indian tribes \nrelated to the land exchange.” § 3003(c)(3)(A), id., at 3733. Following consultation with the Indian \ntribes, the Secretary must consult with Resolution “and seek to find mutually acceptable measures \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 16 of 26\n   \n \nto—(i) address the concerns of the affected Indian tribes; and (ii) minimize the adverse effects on \nthe affected Indian tribes resulting from mining and related activities on the Federal land conveyed \nto Resolution Copper under this section.” § 3003(c)(3)(B), id., at 3733. \n82.  Once the Secretary publishes the EIS, Section 3003 provides that “the Secretary shall \nconvey all right, title, and interest of the United States” in Oak Flat “to Resolution Copper” within \n“60 days.” § 3003(c)(10), id., at 3736. \nResolution Copper’s mine will destroy Oak Flat \n83.  The government initially published an EIS on January 15, 2021, but withdrew it a few \nweeks later, stating that it needed additional “time” to “fully understand concerns raised by \nTribes.” USDA, Resolution Copper Project & Land Exchange Environmental Impact Statement: \nProject Update (Feb. 21, 2023), https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/. \n84.  Before publishing the EIS, the government failed to coordinate with the ACHP in the \nproduction of a plan to mitigate harm to Oak Flat’s historical features. \n85.  Due  to  this  failure,  the  ACHP  submitted  comments  in  March  2021  that  included \nsuggestions to which the agencies were required to respond. \n86.  The government declined to adopt the ACHP’s suggestions in a letter issued in April \n2025. \n87.  The government republished the EIS on June 20, 2025. \n88.  The EIS confirms that the mine will destroy Oak Flat. \n89.  The copper is located between 4,500 and 7,000 feet below Oak Flat’s surface. To mine \nit, Resolution will use a technique called panel caving, which involves tunneling beneath the ore, \nfracturing it with explosives, and removing it from below. \n90.  This method is cheaper than other feasible mining techniques but far more destructive of \nOak Flat’s surface. \n91.  Once the ore is removed, approximately 1.37 billion tons of toxic waste (“tailings”) will \nneed to be stored forever. This will permanently bury or otherwise destroy many prehistoric and \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 17 of 26\n   \n \nhistoric cultural artifacts, including human burials. Oak Flat itself will collapse (“subside”) into a \ncrater almost 2 miles across and 800 to 1,110 feet deep. \n92.  The EIS admits that the impacts of the mine will be “immediate, permanent, and large in \nscale”; that all “public access” to the site will be “lost”; and that nothing can “replace or replicate \nthe Tribal resources and [traditional cultural properties] that would be destroyed.” 1-EIS-153; 3-\nEIS-892. \n93.  Among other things, the mine will destroy the places used for Sunrise, Holy Grounds, \nand other sacred ceremonies; old-growth oak groves and sacred medicinal plants; sacred springs, \nincluding Dripping Spring; burial grounds; and ancient religious and cultural artifacts, including \nthe centuries-old petroglyphs of Tséyaa Gogeschin. \n94.  The destruction of Oak Flat will terminate the Apaches’ access to the site, destroy the \nfoods, medicines, springs, artifacts and locations that are essential to their religious practices, and \nmake it physically impossible for the Apaches to ever engage in their core religious practices again. \nImpacted groups challenged the 2021 EIS \n95.  When the government initially published an EIS in 2021 (before withdrawing it a few \nweeks later), three lawsuits were filed challenging the adequacy of the EIS and the legality of the \nland transfer. Apache Stronghold v. United States, No. 2:21-cv-50 (D. Ariz. Jan. 12, 2021); San \nCarlos Apache Tribe v. U.S. Forest Serv., No. 2:21-cv-68 (D. Ariz. Jan. 14, 2021); Ariz. Mining \nReform Coal. v. U.S. Forest Serv., No. 2:21-cv-122 (D. Ariz. Jan. 22, 2021). \n96.  Two of those lawsuits focused on the adequacy of the 2021 EIS and were stayed when \nthe EIS was withdrawn on March 1, 2021. Order, San Carlos Apache Tribe, No. 2:21-cv-68 (D. \nAriz. Mar. 23, 2021), ECF No. 47; Order, Ariz. Mining Reform Coal., No. 2:21-cv-122 (D. Ariz. \nMar. 16, 2021), ECF No. 35. \n97.  One of the lawsuits challenged the legality of the land transfer under the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act and First Amendment and sought an emergency injunction. The district \ncourt declined to enjoin the land transfer. Apache Stronghold, No. 2:21-cv-50, 2021 WL 689906 \n(D. Ariz. Feb. 22, 2021). The en banc Ninth Circuit affirmed by a sharply divided, 6-5 vote. Apache \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 18 of 26\n   \n \nStronghold, 101 F.4th 1036. The Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari on May 27, 2025, over \na dissenting opinion from Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas, Apache Stronghold, 145 S. \nCt. 1480, and is currently considering a petition for rehearing asking it to reconsider the denial of \ncertiorari, Apache Stronghold v. United States, No. 24-291 (U.S. petition for rehearing filed June \n23, 2025). \nThe government issued a new EIS and sped ahead with the land transfer \n98.  On March 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14241, titled Immediate \nMeasures to Increase American Mineral Production. Exec. Order No. 14241, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,673 \n(Mar. 20, 2025). Executive Order 14241 states that the United States must “take immediate action \nto facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent” and orders agencies to \n“identify  priority  projects  that  can  be  immediately  approved  or  for  which  permits  can  be \nimmediately issued.” Id. §§ 1, 3. \n99.  On June 20, 2025, the Forest Service published a new final EIS. \n100. After publication of the EIS, the government must convey Oak Flat to Resolution within \n60 days, which the government has represented that it intends to do on August 19, 2025. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. \n101. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n102. Under RFRA, “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” \nunless it satisfies strict scrutiny. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a)-(b). \n103. Strict scrutiny requires that the government “demonstrates that application of the burden \nto the person–(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b); \nSingh v. Berger, 56 F.4th 88, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 19 of 26\n   \n \n104. RFRA broadly defines the “exercise of religion” to include “any exercise of religion, \nwhether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(4) \n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5). \n105. RFRA also defines the “exercise of religion” to include “[t]he use ... of real property” for \nreligious exercise. Id. §§ 2000bb-2(4), 2000cc-5(7)(B). \n106. A compelling interest includes “only those interests of the highest order.” Wisconsin v. \nYoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215 (1972). And the least-restrictive-means standard is “exceptionally \ndemanding.” Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 728 (2014). To pass the least-\nrestrictive-means test, the government must show “that it lacks other means of achieving its desired \ngoal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion” by the religious objector. \nId. \n107. Plaintiffs  exercise  their  religion  by  visiting,  praying,  and  participating  in  sacred \nceremonies that are uniquely tied to Oak Flat and cannot be replicated elsewhere.  Plaintiffs intend \nto  continue  in  their  religious  exercise  at  Oak  Flat  through  their  ongoing,  imminent,  active \nparticipation in ceremonies and religious observances at Oak Flat. \n108. The transfer and destruction of Oak Flat substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n109. Denying Plaintiffs access to Oak Flat substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n110. Physically destroying Plaintiffs’ sacred site substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ religious \nexercise.  \n111. Interfering  with  Plaintiffs’  religious  ceremonies  at  Oak  Flat  substantially  burdens \nPlaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n112. Completely preventing Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion at Oak Flat substantially burdens \nPlaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n113. Defendants cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 20 of 26\n   \n \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \nProhibition of Free Exercise \n114. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n115. The  First  Amendment  provides  that  “Congress  shall  make  no  law  respecting  an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n116. Under the Free Exercise Clause, government action burdening religion is protected from \nstrict scrutiny only if it constitutes a valid and neutral law of general applicability. \n117. Failing either the neutrality or general applicability test is sufficient to trigger strict \nscrutiny.  \n118. The government’s action here burdens Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n119. The government’s action here is neither neutral nor generally applicable. \n120. The  government’s  action  is  neither  neutral  nor  generally  applicable  because  it \ndisproportionately affects the religious exercise of Native Americans and almost no others, and \nbecause it was enacted with hostility toward Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n121. The government’s action is neither neutral nor generally applicable because it involves a \ncalculated,  discretionary,  and  individualized  decision  about  a  single  piece  of  land,  and  it \nintentionally favors the secular use of copper mining over religious use by Apaches. \n122. The government’s action cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \nBurden on the Right to Direct the Religious Upbringing of Children \n123. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n124. The government’s actions are subject to strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause \nwhen they “substantially interfer[e] with the religious development” of children. Mahmoud, 145 \nS. Ct. at 2356 (quoting Yoder, 406 U.S. at 218). \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 21 of 26\n   \n \n125. When the government’s actions impose an “objective danger,” or a “very real threat of \nundermining” parents’ religious exercise, they impose a burden on religious exercise. Id. at 2349, \n2355. \n126. The relevant religious exercise here is the plaintiff parents’ ability to raise their children \nin accordance with their Apache religious beliefs, which includes worship, prayer, gathering \nmedicine, and holding religious ceremonies at Oak Flat. \n127. By transferring and destroying Oak Flat, the government is cutting off Apache parents \nfrom ever engaging in core religious practices that are essential to their children’s religious \ndevelopment. This not only poses an “objective danger” or “very real threat of undermining” \nPlaintiffs’ religious exercise, but also renders it altogether physically impossible. \n128. The government’s actions cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the National Environmental Policy Act \n129. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n130. The National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370, is designed to ensure \nthat the government’s actions are consistent with the “broad national commitment to protecting \nand promoting environmental quality.” Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. \n332, 348 (1989). \n131. NEPA realizes its “sweeping policy goals” “through a set of ‘action-forcing’ procedures \nthat require that agencies take a ‘hard look at environmental consequences’” before engaging in \ncertain projects. Id. at 350 (quoting Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 410 n.21 (1976)). \n132. The land-transfer statute instructs the government to “carry out the land exchange in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act”  in  “a  single \nenvironmental impact statement.” § 3003(c)(9)(A)–(B), 128 Stat. 3735.  \n133. By expressly incorporating NEPA, Congress indicated that the government must take a \nhard  look  at  the  land  transfer’s  environmental  consequences  and  then  show  its  work  in  a \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 22 of 26\n   \n \n“reasonable and reasonably explained” EIS. Seven Cnty. Infrastructure. Coal. v. Eagle County, \n145 S. Ct. 1497, 1511 (2025). \n134. In 2023, Congress amended NEPA through the BUILDER Act, Pub. L. 118-5, Div. C, \nTit. III, § 321, 137 Stat. 38–39, which sets a default rule that an EIS “shall not exceed 150 pages.” \n42 U.S.C. § 4336a(e)(1)(A); accord Seven Cnty., 145 S. Ct. at 1512 n.3. \n135. For projects of “extraordinary complexity,” an EIS “shall not exceed 300 pages.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 4336a(e)(1)(B). \n136. The EIS in this case is over 1,000 pages. It also includes appendices adding approximately \n1,400 more pages. Thus, the EIS exceeds NEPA’s length limitation. \n137. NEPA further requires that agencies “include in every recommendation or report on … \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed \nstatement by the responsible official on—(iii) a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed \nagency action, including an analysis of any negative environmental impacts of not implementing \nthe proposed  agency action in the case of a no action alternative, that are technically  and \neconomically feasible, and meet the purpose and need of the proposal.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C)(iii). \n138. NEPA  also  requires  that  agencies  “study,  develop,  and  describe  technically  and \neconomically feasible alternatives” to proposed plans. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(F).  \n139. The  EIS  here  does  not  comply  with  NEPA’s  requirement  to  consider  reasonable \nalternatives.  Instead,  the  EIS  admits  that  “alternative  underground  mining  methods”  “could \nphysically be applied” to recover the copper without disturbing the surface of Oak Flat, but \ndeclines to even consider them based on Resolution’s claim that these alternatives would have \n“higher operational costs” and “reduce the amount of ore that could be profitably mined.” 4-EIS-\nF-3. The failure to consider reasonable alternatives violates NEPA. \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the National Historic Preservation Act \n140. Congress enacted the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 54 U.S.C. §§ 300101 \net seq., in 1966, with the goal of identifying and protecting the nation’s historical treasures. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 23 of 26\n   \n \n141. The NHPA requires federal agencies to consider the impact of any undertaking on \nproperties of historical significance, including traditional religious and cultural importance to an \nIndian tribe. \n142. Section 106 of the NHPA requires that, prior to issuance of a federal permit or license, \nfederal  agencies  shall  take  into  consideration  the  effects  of  an  “undertaking”  on  “historic \npropert[ies].” 54 U.S.C. § 306108. Agencies “must complete the section 106 process ‘prior to the \napproval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any \nlicense.’”  36  C.F.R.  § 800.1(c).  The  NHPA  established  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic \nPreservation (“ACHP”), an independent federal agency with the primary mission to encourage \nhistoric preservation in the government and across the nation. \n143. The NHPA defines undertaking as “a project, activity, or program funded in whole or in \npart under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including – (1) those carried out \nby or on behalf of the Federal agency; (2) those carried out with Federal financial assistance; \n(3) those requiring a Federal permit, license, or approval; and (4) those subject to State or local \nregulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a Federal agency.” 54 U.S.C. \n§ 300320; 36 C.F.R. § 800.16(y). \n144. The NHPA Section 106 process requires federal agencies involved in undertakings to \nmake a reasonable and good faith effort to identify and disclose historic properties within affected \nareas, evaluate the potential adverse effects of the federal undertaking to the historic properties, \nand seek ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any adverse effects to the historic properties. 36 \nC.F.R. §§ 800.4-800.6. \n145. The Section 106 process requires consultation with Indian Tribes on federal undertakings \nthat potentially affect sites that are culturally significant to Indian Tribes. 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(2); \n54 U.S.C. § 302706 (properties “of traditional religious and cultural importance to” a Tribe may \nbe included on the National Register, and federal agencies “shall consult with any Indian Tribe … \nthat attaches religious and cultural significance” to such properties). \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 24 of 26\n   \n \n146. If the agency finds that historic properties are affected, it must provide notification to all \nconsulting parties and invite their views to assess adverse effects. 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(2). Any \nadverse effects to historic properties must be resolved, involving all consulting parties and the \npublic. Id. § 800.6. If adverse effects cannot be resolved, the process is elevated again to the ACHP \nand the head of the agency undertaking the action. Id. § 800.7. Until this process is complete, the \naction in question cannot go forward. \n147. If adverse effects on historic sites are identified, the agency must continue consulting with \nthe parties and avoid or mitigate any adverse effects. \n148. If an agreement between the ACHP and the agencies cannot be reached as to a plan for \nmitigation, the agency “must make clear in the record that the ACHP’s comments were taken \nseriously.” Friends of the Atglen-Susquehanna Trail, Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 252 F.3d 246, \n265 (3d Cir. 2001). \n149. The government failed to coordinate with the ACHP before it issued the first EIS in 2021. \n150. In 2025, before issuing the second EIS, the government responded to the ACHP’s \ncomments suggesting mitigation efforts to preserve Oak Flat.  \n151. However, the agency’s response failed to take seriously the ACHP’s recommendations \nand refused to mitigate the harm to Oak Flat and other historic properties that will be destroyed by \nthe mine. This violated the NHPA. \nCOUNT VI \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n152. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n153. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n154. For the reasons given above, the EIS is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.” Id. \n155. Accordingly, the EIS must be vacated and set aside. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 25 of 26\n   \n \n156. Defendants’ APA violations have caused and will continue to cause ongoing irreparable \nharm to Plaintiffs. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:  \na.  Declare that the transfer and destruction of Oak Flat violates and is invalid under RFRA; \nb.  Declare that the transfer and destruction of Oak Flat violates and is invalid under the Free \nExercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nc.  Declare that the Defendants’ actions violate NEPA, the NHPA, the APA, other laws noted \nherein, and the implementing regulations and policies of these laws;  \nd.  Issue a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from conveying any right, title, or \ninterest of the United States in Oak Flat to Resolution Copper or otherwise allowing or \nauthorizing Resolution Copper to take any action affecting the physical integrity of Oak \nFlat; \ne.  Set aside and vacate the EIS and void any actions or decisions based on the EIS; \nf.  Award  Plaintiffs  compensatory  and  nominal  damages  for  the  loss  of  their  rights  as \nprotected by the United States Constitution, RFRA, and other federal laws; \ng.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this action and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and  \nh.  Award such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable and just. \nJURY DEMAND \nPlaintiffs request a trial by jury on all issues so triable. \n \n[Signature page attached] \n   \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02408     Document 1     Filed 07/24/25     Page 26 of 26\n   \n \nRespectfully submitted this 24th day of July, 2025. \n \n/s/ Christian J.
