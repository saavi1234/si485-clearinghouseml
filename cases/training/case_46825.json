On May 21, 2025, the Plaintiffs, three minor students in New York City Public Schools, filed this lawsuit in the Southern District of New York. The Plaintiffs brought this action against Melissa Aviles-Ramos in her official capacity as Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, the New York City Department of Education, and the City of New York under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants violated their due process rights under the United States Constitution by subjecting them to an unconstitutional standard of proof in their student disciplinary hearing. According to their complaint, the Defendants use a &ldquo;substantial and competent evidence&rdquo; standard in student disciplinary proceedings and are not required to show that it is more likely than not that the alleged misconduct occurred before students are suspended.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Represented by Bronx Legal Services and Queens Legal Services, the Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and attorney&rsquo;s fees. Additionally, the Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief that the &ldquo;competent and substantial evidence&rdquo; standard used by Defendants was unconstitutional as applied to student discipline hearings for suspensions longer than five school days, and injunctive relief, directing Defendants to employ the &ldquo;preponderance of the evidence&rdquo; standard in all long-term suspension hearings. The case was assigned to District Judge J. Paul Oetken.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 12, 2025, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, since they had the right to appeal the results of their suspension hearings, but chose not to appeal. Moreover, they claimed that the &ldquo;substantial and competent evidence&rdquo; standard is an appropriate and constitutional standard of proof in administrative proceedings. According to the Defendants, the standard is supplied by statute and is commonly used by federal and state agencies in administrative decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Each student challenged their suspension and received a \nhearing in accordance with the school disciplinary procedures provided by law, and despite \nhaving an opportunity to introduce evidence and cross-examine witnesses, each student lost \ntheir challenge. Plaintiffs contend their procedural due process rights were nonetheless \nviolated because the hearing evidence was judged under a โsubstantial and competent \nevidenceโ standard. The students claim they should not have been suspended because, \naccording to them, โthe evidence presented that Plaintiffs did not engage in the alleged \ninfraction was at least as strong as the evidence that they did.โ Although each Plaintiff had \nthe right to challenge the outcome of the disciplinary hearings in an administrative appeal, \neach Plaintiff declined to do so. \n  The Complaint should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) \nfor two reasons: \n  First, Plaintiffs could have, and should have, appealed the hearing officersโ respective \ndeterminations sustaining their suspensions, and their failure to do so requires dismissal of \nthe Complaint. Plaintiffs cannot seriously claim they were denied adequate procedural due \nprocess when they failed to exercise the due process rights available to them under the law. \n  Second, even assuming the truth of Plaintiffsโ allegations, their claim that the \napplication of the โsubstantial and competent evidenceโ standard somehow deprived them \nof procedural due process is meritless. The evidentiary standard is imposed by statute (N.Y. \nState Administrative Procedure Act ยง 306(1)), and the same procedural due process \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 6 of 17\n \narguments Plaintiffs raise here were squarely rejected in Board of Education v. Mills, 741 \nN.Y.S.2d 589, 591 (App. Div. 3d Depโt 2002). Although Plaintiffs criticize Mills and urge \nthe Court to ignore that decision, there is no basis to do so. Moreover, because Plaintiffs are \nchallenging the constitutionality of a state statute, they are required under N.Y. C.P.L.R. \nยง 1012(b)(1) to notify the Office of the New York Attorney General about this lawsuit, and \nthere is no evidence that Plaintiffs served notice on the Attorney General. \n  Defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted, and the Complaint should be \ndismissed with prejudice. \nStatement of Facts \nA.  Alleged Facts Regarding Y.H. \nY.H., a 13-year-old 8th grade student at I.S. 96 Bay Academy, was suspended during \nthe 2023-2024 school year when he was a 7th grade student at the same school. (ECF No. 1, \nยถ 72.) Y.H.โs mother was informed that Y.H. had received a superintendentโs suspension, \nand later received a letter directing Y.H. to attend an alternative learning center (โALCโ) \npending a June 26, 2024 suspension hearing. (Id., ยถยถ 82-86, 89.) Y.H.โs mother elected not to \nsend Y.H. to the ALC before the hearing. (Id., ยถ 87.) \nAt the hearing, the school charged Y.H. with โusing force against or inflicting or \nattempting to inflict serious injury against school personnel.โ (Id., ยถยถ 88-89.) Although Y.H. \nand his representative maintained that the physical contact with school personnel was \naccidental and lacked intent, the hearing officer sustained the charge and imposed a 16-day \nsuspension. (Id., ยถยถ 93, 95โ96.) Y.H. later enrolled in a summer program and returned to \nschool on time in September 2024. (Id., ยถยถ 98โ99.) Y.H. did not appeal the hearing officerโs \nJune 28, 2024 determination. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 7 of 17\n \nB.  Alleged Facts Regarding Y.P. \nY.P., a 14-year-old 9th grade student with a disability, was suspended in March 2024 \nwhile in 8th grade at I.S. 96 Seth Low Intermediate School (ECF No. 1, ยถยถ 101-02.) Y.P. \nwas charged with possession of a controlled substance (marijuana) and directed to attend an \nALC pending an April 9, 2024 suspension hearing. (Id., ยถยถ 110-14.) On April 18, 2024, R.F. \nwas notified that the hearing officer sustained the charge and imposed a 10-day suspension. \n(Id., ยถยถ 121, 124-25.) Y.P. did not appeal the hearing officerโs April 18, 2024 determination. \nC.  Alleged Facts Regarding H.C. \nH.C., a 12-year-old 7th grade student with a disability, was suspended in December \n2024 while attending Pugsley Preparatory Academy. (ECF No. 1, ยถยถ 130-31.) On December \n6, 2024, H.C.โs mother received a letter charging H.C. with acts that constituted a โdanger \nto the health, safety, welfare, and moralsโ of herself and others at the school, and directing \nher to attend an ALC. (Id., ยถ 145-46.). H.C.โs mother elected not to send H.C. to the ALC \nbefore her December 12, 2024 hearing. (Id., ยถ 146.) The hearing officer sustained the charge \nand imposed a 17-day suspension. (Id., ยถยถ 156-57.) H.C. did not appeal the hearing officerโs \nDecember 19, 2024 determination. \nLegal Standard \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must plead factual \nallegations that, accepted as true, โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). This requires that the โplaintiff plead factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for \nthe misconduct alleged.โ Id. A plaintiff must assert โmore than labels and conclusions, and \na formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.โ Id. at 555. โMere \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 8 of 17\n \nconclusory statementsโ or โthreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of actionโ are not \nentitled to a presumption of truth. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nArgument \nI.  Plaintiffsโ Procedural Due Process Claim Should Be Dismissed Because They \nFailed to Exhaust Their Administrative Remedies \nPlaintiffsโ failure to exhaust their administrative remedies requires dismissal of their \ndue process claim. Although Plaintiffs admit they each had the right to appeal the results of \ntheir suspension hearings (ECF No. 1, ยถ 37), they chose not to appeal. Plaintiffs cannot \nseriously claim they were denied adequate due process when they failed to exercise the due \nprocess rights available to them under the law. \nThe Complaintโs sole unlabeled cause of action asserts a procedural due process \nclaim. (ECF No. 1, ยถ 166 (citing Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976) and alleging \nthat Plaintiffs were denied โadequate procedural protectionsโ).) A plaintiff asserting a \nprocedural due process claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 is obligated to exhaust state \nadministrative remedies before filing a federal lawsuit. Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 126 \n(1990) (โto determine whether a constitutional violation has occurred, it is necessary to ask \nwhat process the State provided, and whether it was constitutionally adequate. This inquiry \nwould examine the procedural safeguards built into the statutory or administrative \nprocedure of effecting the deprivation . . . .โ); Wilbur v. Harris, 53 F.3d 542, 544 (2d Cir. \n1995) (โ[Procedural due process] claims do require analysis of state [administrative] \nremedies because the constitutional violation on which to base a ยง 1983 claim is not \ncomplete until life, liberty, or property is deprived without due process of law.โ). \nFor a school suspension of longer than five days, the first step in the administrative \nprocess is a fair hearing, also known as a superintendentโs suspension hearing, during which \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 9 of 17\n \nboth the student and the school district are afforded an opportunity to present evidence and \ncross-examine witnesses. (ECF No. 1, ยถยถ 22-23.) Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 ยง III.B.3.s;1 \nsee N.Y. Educ. Law ยง 3214(3)(c)(1). If a studentโs suspension is sustained for longer than \nfive days after the fair hearing, the next step in the administrative process is an appeal by the \nstudent to the Chancellor. (ECF No. 1, ยถ 37.) Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 ยง IV; see N.Y. \nEduc. Law ยง 3214(3)(c)(1). A student who is still aggrieved after an appeal to the Chancellor \nhas the right to commence a N.Y. C.P.L.R. Article 78 proceeding within the four-month \nstatute of limitations applied by N.Y. C.P.L.R. ยง 217(1). See, e.g., Juan C. v. Cortines, 679 \nN.E.2d 1061 (N.Y. 1997) (decision by New York Court of Appeals on Article 78 challenge \nto New York City public school studentโs suspension following โadministrative appealโ to \nChancellor). \nDespite alleging they were denied procedural due process, Plaintiffs chose not to \nappeal their respective hearing determinations to the Chancellor. (ECF No. 1, ยถยถ 98-99 \n(admitting that Y.H. did not appeal, served out the suspension over the summer, and began \nthe next school year on time in September 2024); ยถยถ 125-29 (admitting that Y.P. did not \nappeal, served out the suspension, and was able to graduate 8th grade on time); ยถยถ 156-62 \n(admitting that H.C. served out the suspension and did not appeal). Plaintiffsโ failure to \nexhaust their administrative remedies requires dismissal of their procedural due process \nclaim because they failed to use the โprocedural safeguards built into the statutory or \nadministrative procedure.โ Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 126.2 \n \n1 A copy of Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 is attached as Tambone Declaration Exhibit 1 and is also available \non the DOEโs website at www.schools.nyc.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/a-443-3-5-04-\nenglish.pdf. \n2 See Watergate II Apartments v. Buffalo Sewer Auth., 385 N.E.2d 560, 563 (N.Y. 1978) (โIt is hornbook law that \none who objects to the act of an administrative agency must exhaust available administrative remedies before \n \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 10 of 17\n \nII.  The Complaint Also Fails to State a Procedural Due Process Claim Because the \nโSubstantial Evidenceโ Standard Is An Appropriate and Constitutional Standard \nof Proof in Administrative Hearings \nA.  The โsubstantial and competent evidenceโ standard, also known simply as \nthe โsubstantial evidenceโ standard, is routinely employed in federal and \nstate administrative decision-making \nPlaintiffs incorrectly allege in Paragraph 31 of the Complaint that โno standard of \nproof is established by statute or regulationโ with respect to long-term school suspensions. \n(ECF No. 1, ยถ 31.) On the contrary, as the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division \nhas held, the standard is supplied by statute: New York State Administrative Procedure Act \nยง 306(1). Bd. of Educ. v. Mills, 741 N.Y.S.2d 589, 591 (App. Div. 3d Depโt 2002) (โcompetent \nand substantial evidence . . . is the standard imposed by statuteโ). The phrase โcompetent \nand substantial evidenceโ is commonly shortened to โsubstantial evidence,โ and the Mills \ncourt repeatedly refers to the standard as the โsubstantial evidence standard.โ Id. \nThe substantial evidence standard is routinely used in administrative decision-\nmaking by federal and state agencies. For instance, as Mills held, the specific standard at \nissue here is derived from New York State Administrative Procedure Act ยง 306(1), which \nprovides: โNo decision, determination or order shall be made except upon consideration of \nthe record as a whole or such portion thereof as may be cited by any party to the proceeding \nand as supported by and in accordance with substantial evidence.โ Similarly, in a N.Y. \nC.P.L.R. Article 78 proceeding challenging the result of an administrative hearing, the \n \nbeing permitted to litigate in a court of lawโ); W.B. v. Baldwinsville Cent. Sch. Dist., 806 N.Y.S.2d 449, 449 (Sup. \nCt. Onondaga Cnty. 2005) (dismissing lawsuit challenging suspension for entire school year because petitioner \nfailed โto exhaust the administrative remedies available under the Education Lawโ) (citing Langston v. Iroquois \nCent. Sch. Dist., 736 N.Y.S.2d 815, 816 (App. Div. 4th Depโt 2002)); Boyle v. Caledonia-Mumford Cent. Sch., 34 \nN.Y.S.3d 548, 550 (App. Div. 4th Depโt 2016) (federal and state due process rights were โwaivedโ when \nstudentโs father โopted not to follow through with a hearing and instead enrolled them in another school \ndistrictโ). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 11 of 17\n \nquestion before the court is whether the determination was โsupported by substantial \nevidence.โ N.Y. C.P.L.R. ยง 7803(4); see Agudio v. State Univ. of N.Y., 83 N.Y.S.3d 343, 345-\n46 (App. Div. 3d Depโt) (citing C.P.L.R. ยง 7803(4) and holding, โA collegeโs determination \nthat a student violated its code of conduct will be upheld if supported by substantial \nevidence in the recordโ). \nIn the federal context, the โsubstantial evidenceโ standard is routinely applied in \nfederal agency decision-making, including in quasi-judicial proceedings, and has been \nrepeatedly approved of by the Second Circuit. See, e.g., Ojo v. Garland, 25 F.4th 152, 159-60 \n(2d Cir. 2022) (in considering an appeal from the Board of Immigration Appeals โwe apply \nthe deferential substantial evidence standard of review to the agencyโs factual \nfindings . . . that is, we uphold the agencyโs factual findings if they are supported by \nreasonable, substantial and probative evidence in the record . . . .โ) (citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). \nIn Mills, โthe suspended student and his mother . . . argue[d] that since substantial \nevidence is the standard used for appellate review of administrative determinations, the \nstandard employed at the hearing should be not less than a preponderance of the evidence.โ \nMills, 741 N.Y.S.2d at 590. The Appellate Division rejected that procedural due process \nargument. Id. at 590-91. In Paragraph 31 and Footnote 14 of the Complaint, Plaintiffs \nacknowledge that in this action, they are rehashing the failed procedural due process \nargument raised in Mills, and they urge this Court to hold that โthe [Mills] courtโs analysis \nerred.โ (ECF No. 1 at 8, n.14.) Each of Plaintiffsโ criticisms of Mills are meritless. \nFirst, Plaintiffs contend Mills was wrongly decided because the court โconflat[ed] the \nstandard imposed by reviewing courts on appeal with that applied by finders of fact.โ (ECF \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 12 of 17\n \nNo. 1 at 8, n.14.) Plaintiffs are incorrect. Mills cited the New York Court of Appeals \ndecision in 300 Gramatan Ave. Associates v. State Div. of Human Rights, 379 N.E.2d 1183 (N.Y. \n1978). There, the Court of Appeals held that โsubstantial evidence,โ โa term of art as related \nto administrative decision making,โ โmeans such relevant proof as a reasonable mind may \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion or ultimate fact . . . More than seeming or \nimaginary, it is less than a preponderance of the evidence, overwhelming evidence or \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt.โ Id. at 1186-87. \nThis description, while applicable in an appellate context, also plainly applies to the \nstandard of review of an administrative fact finder, particularly because the Court of \nAppeals highlighted the standard in the context of โadministrative decision making.โ The \nSecond Circuit has similarly described the โsubstantial evidenceโ standard in ERISA \nproceedings as follows: โSubstantial evidence . . . โis such evidence that a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support the conclusion reached by the [decisionmaker \nand] . . . requires more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.โโ Miller v. United \nWelfare Fund, 72 F.3d 1066, 1072 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting Sandoval v. Aetna Life & Casualty \nIns. Co., 967 F.2d 377, 382 (10th Cir. 1992)). \nSecond, Plaintiffs contend Mills was wrongly decided because the court โ[found] that \nthe standard is โimposed by statuteโ in reference to the [New York State Administrative \nProcedure Act, when the Act merely references it as an available option in administrative \nproceedings.โ (ECF No. 1 at 8, n.14.) Again, Plaintiffs are wrong. Section 306(1) of the \nState Administrative Procedure Act provides, โNo decision, determination or order shall be \nmade except upon consideration of the record as a whole or such portion thereof as may be \ncited by any party to the proceeding and as supported by and in accordance with substantial \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 13 of 17\n \nevidence.โ Nothing about this language is discretionary, and the statute does not merely \nโreferenceโ the concept of โsubstantial evidenceโ โas an available option.โ Instead, the \nstatute states in mandatory terms that โNo decision, determination or order shall be made \nexcept . . . as supported by and in accordance with substantial evidence.โ (Emphasis added). \nThird, Plaintiffs contend Mills was wrongly decided because the court โ[found] that \nschool discipline hearings fail the โstigma plusโ test, a test wholly inapplicable in this context \ngiven the clear property interests students have in their education.โ (ECF No. 1 at 8, n.14.) \nBut Mills acknowledgedโand the parties to that case agreedโthat students have โproperty \nand liberty interests worthy of protection,โ so the studentsโ property interests in their \neducation was never a question in the case. That Mills went further and applied a legal test \nthat Plaintiffs consider irrelevant is hardly a basis to disregard its holding. \nFourth, Plaintiffs contend Mills was wrongly decided because the court โconclud[ed], \nwithout engaging in any meaningful Mathews v. Eldrige balancing analysis, that the โuse of \nthe competent and substantial evidence standard [does not risk] an erroneous deprivation of \nthe studentโs liberty and property interests.โโ (ECF No. 1 at 8, n.14.) Rather, Mills properly \nrecited and considered the factors to be considered under Mathews and ultimately held that \nadherence to the โsubstantial evidenceโ standard, as articulated by the New York Court of \nAppeals, โassures protection of a studentโs constitutionally protected interests in a \nsuspension hearing.โ Mills, 741 N.Y.S.2d at 591. Mills reiterated that the New York Court of \nAppeals has held that โthe burden of proof and evidentiary rules imposed in a school \ndisciplinary proceeding are not as stringent as in a formal trial.โ Bd. of Educ. v. Commโr of \nEduc., 690 N.E.2d 480, 484 (N.Y. 1997). The Second Circuit has reached a similar holding. \nSee, e.g., Rocker v. Celebrezze, 358 F.2d 119, 122 (2d Cir. 1966) (โ[T]he rules governing the \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 14 of 17\n \nadmission of evidence in administrative proceedings are considerably more relaxed. \nConsequently, hearsay is generally admissible if reliable and may be given such probative \nforce as is warranted.โ); see also 42 U.S.C. ยง 405(b)(1) (โEvidence may be received at any \nhearing before the Commissioner of Social Security even though inadmissible under rules of \nevidence applicable to court procedure.โ). \nIn sum, Plaintiffsโ primary contention here is that anything less than a \nโpreponderance of the evidenceโ standard โeffectively shifts the burden to students to prove \nthat they did not engage in the alleged misconduct.โ (ECF No. 1, ยถ 1.) That contention is \nincorrect. The standard is derived directly from a New York state statute (State \nAdministrative Procedure Act ยง 306(1)), and the New York Court of Appeals has defined \nโsubstantial evidenceโ as โMore than seeming or imaginary, it is less than a preponderance \nof the evidence, overwhelming evidence or evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.โ 300 \nGramatan Ave. Associates, 379 N.E.2d at 1186-87. The Second Circuit has similarly defined \nโsubstantial evidenceโ as โsuch evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate \nto support the conclusion reached by the [decisionmaker and] . . . requires more than a \nscintilla but less than a preponderance.โโ Miller, 72 F.3d at 1072. \nThe Supreme Court held in 1975 that โยง 1983 does not extend the right to relitigate \nin federal court evidentiary questions arising in school disciplinary proceedings . . . .โ Wood \nv. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 326 (1975). There is no basis to hold that the New York statutory \nstandard of proof for school disciplinary hearings constitutes a violation of studentsโ \nprocedural due process rights, especially because these Plaintiffs admit they did not exercise \nall their due process rights. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 15 of 17\n \nB.  Plaintiffs are challenging the constitutionality of a New York state statute \n(State Administrative Procedure Act ยง 306(1)), and must therefore notify \nthe Office of the New York Attorney General about this lawsuit \nโUnder New York law, if a party challenges the constitutionality of a state statute in \nan action to which the state is not a party, a court may not consider the challenge unless the \nAttorney General is โnotified and permitted to interveneโ in defense of the statute.โ Kelsey v. \nSherman, No. 22 CV 1934 (VB), 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129084, at *6, 2024 WL 3498052 \n(S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2024) (quoting N.Y. C.P.L.R. ยง 1012(b)(1), (3)). Here, Plaintiff is \nchallenging the constitutionality of the โsubstantial evidenceโ standard of proof provided by \na state statute, State Administrative Procedure Act ยง 306(1). There is no evidence in the \nrecord that Plaintiffs served the Complaint on the Office of the New York Attorney \nGeneral. Before any further litigation in this action, Plaintiffs should be required to serve a \ncopy of the Complaint on the New York Attorney General, and the Attorney General \nshould, if she so desires, be permitted to intervene in this action in defense of the statute. \nConclusion \n  Defendantsโ motion to dismiss should be granted. Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their \nadministrative remedies and should not be heard to complain that they were deprived of due \nprocess. At any rate, even assuming the truth of Plaintiffsโ allegations, Plaintiffs fail to state \na claim upon which relief may be granted because the โsubstantial evidenceโ standard \ncontains adequate procedural safeguards. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 18     Filed 08/12/25     Page 16 of 17\n \nDated: New York, New York  MURIEL GOODE-TRUFANT \n  August 12, 2025  Corporation Counsel of the City of New York \nAttorney for Defendants \nBy:  /s/ Nicholas R.

Y.H., Y.P., and H.C. (together, โPlaintiffsโ)1 bring this action against Melissa Aviles-\nRamos, in her official capacity as Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education; the \nNew York City Department of Education; and the City of New York (collectively, โDefendantsโ) \nto challenge the constitutionality of the burden of proof applied in school disciplinary hearings for \nlong-term suspensions. Under the โsubstantial and competent evidenceโ standard currently applied, \nDefendants are not even required to show that it is more likely than not that the alleged misconduct \n \n1 Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2, the plaintiffs, who are all minors, are identified by their initials to protect their \nprivacy. Their parents are also identified by their initials because doing otherwise would in effect identify the plaintiffs \nand defeat the purpose of Rule 5.2.  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 2 of 38\noccurred before students are suspended.  This standard effectively shifts the burden to students to \nprove that they did not engage in the alleged misconduct. \n2. At Plaintiffsโ disciplinary hearings, the evidence presented that Plaintiffs did not engage in \nthe alleged infraction was at least as strong as the evidence that they did, and yet under the \nminimal burden of proof applied, each long-term suspension was sustained. Plaintiffs lost school \ndays, special education services, school breakfast and lunches, and the opportunity to participate in \nextracurricular activities and significant school events. In addition, they suffered reputational and \nemotional harm that continues to this day. Because Plaintiffs continue to attend New York City \npublic schools, they remain vulnerable to suffering these harms again in possible future suspension \nproceedings. \n3. The application of the โsubstantial and competent evidenceโ standard deprives Plaintiffs of \nproperty and liberty interests bound up in their education without due process of law, in violation \nof the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n4. This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief \nand to recover damages for violations of Plaintiffsโ rights arising out of this unconstitutional \nburden of proof. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331. \n6. Declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201(a) and by Rules 57 \nand 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n7. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because the New York City Department \nof Education has its principal office in the Southern District of New York.

Plaintiff Y.H. is an 8th grade student in District 21 of New York City Public Schools. \n10. Plaintiff Y.P. is a 9th grade student in District 20 of New York City Public Schools.  \n11. Plaintiff H.C. is a 7th grade student in District 8 of New York City Public Schools. \nDefendants \n12. Defendant Melissa Aviles-Ramos, sued in her official capacity, serves as the Chancellor of \nthe New York City Department of Education and is responsible for the operations of the New York \nCity Department of Education. Defendant Aviles-Ramos has the power and duty to perform any \nduty imposed upon the New York City Department of Education, including the operation of all \ngeneral education and special education programs and services. At all times relevant to the events \ndescribed herein, Defendant Aviles-Ramos acted under color of law of the State of New York and \nin her capacity as agent, servant, and employee of defendant New York City and/or the New York \nCity Department of Education, and within the scope of her employment as such. \n13. Defendant New York City Department of Education is a department within the New York \nCity government that manages New York City Public Schools, which is the largest school district \nin the United States. It maintains its principal place of business at 52 Chambers Street, New York, \nNew York 10007. The New York City Department of Education is responsible for administering \nNew York Cityโs 1,596 public schools, which operate in all five boroughs of New York City and \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 4 of 38\nare attended by approximately 912,064 New York City schoolchildren.2 Defendants Aviles-Ramos \nand the New York City Department of Education are collectively referred to as โNYC DOEโ \nherein. \n14. Defendant City of New York is a municipality within New York State and maintains the \noffices of its Corporation Counsel at 100 Church Street, New York, New York, 10007. The \nChancellor of the New York City Department of Education is appointed by the Mayor of the City \nof New York. \nJURY DEMAND \n15. Plaintiffs demand trial by jury in this action on each and every one of their claims. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n16. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from \ndeprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process. \n17. Fifty years ago, the Supreme Court in Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975), recognized that \na state law establishing a right to a public education triggers cognizable property and liberty \ninterests in that education protected by the United States Constitutionโs due process guarantees. \n18. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 establishes a private cause of action against any person who acts under \ncolor of state law to deprive individuals of โany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and lawsโ of the United States.  \n19. Article XI, Section 1 of the New York State Constitution affords students of the State of \nNew York the right to a sound basic education.3  \nThe New York City School Disciplinary Process \n \n2 DOE Data at a Glance, NYC PUBLIC SCHOOLS, https://www.schools.nyc.gov/about-us/reports/doe-data-at-a-glance \n[https://perma.cc/9R7S-YTRY] (last visited May 3, 2025). \n3 See Bd. of Educ., Levittown Union Free Sch.

The New York City school disciplinary process is governed by New York State Education \nLaw ยง 3214 and New York City Chancellorโs Regulation A-443. All disciplinary action of students \nwith disabilities must adhere to the protections of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(โIDEAโ), 20 U.S.C. ยง 1400 et. seq. \nNew York State Education Law ยง 3214 \n21. In New York State, the board of education, board of trustees, superintendent of schools, or \nprincipal of a school may suspend the following student: โa pupil who is insubordinate or \ndisorderly or violent or disruptive, or whose conduct endangers the safety, morals, health or \nwelfare of others.โ4  \n22. No student may be suspended for longer than five school days โunless the student and the \nperson in parental relation have had an opportunity for a fair hearing, upon reasonable notice, with \nthe right of representation by counsel and to question witnesses and to present witnesses and other \nevidence.โ5  \n23. The superintendent, or a designated hearing officer, must conduct the hearing. A record of \nthe hearing must be maintained. The hearing officer then makes findings of fact and \nrecommendations as to the appropriate measure of discipline.6  \n24. A student has the right to appeal the decision to the board of education who makes its \ndecision solely upon the record before it.7 \n25.

Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 was issued on March 5, 2004, and applies to all New York \nCity Public Schools. \n27. Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 III.B defines a suspension as the โtemporary removal of a \nstudent from the regular school program because his/her behavior negatively affects the health, \nsafety, welfare and/or morals of others.โ9 The same paragraph notes that โ[s]uspension is a serious \nstep and school officials must use appropriate alternative measures to avoid it, if possible.โ10 \n28. Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 III.B.3 details the procedural requirements for suspensions \ngreater than five days, called โSuperintendentโs Suspensions.โ \n29. When a student engages in conduct for which a Superintendentโs Suspension may be \nwarranted, the principal must take the following investigatory steps: โ(1) question the victim and \nany other witnesses to the incident and obtain their signed written statements; (2) question the \naccused student and inform him/her of the misconduct of which he/she is being accused; (3) \nprovide the accused student with an explanation of the evidence and an opportunity to present \nhis/her side of the event, unless it is not feasible to do so; and (4) provide the accused student with \nan opportunity to prepare a signed, written statement.โ If, after taking these steps, the principal \nbelieves a Superintendentโs Suspension is warranted, โhe or she shall notify the Superintendent, \nprovide complete details of the studentโs behavior, including mitigating circumstances, and the \ninvestigative steps that were taken, and request a suspension.

If the suspension is authorized, the school must give immediate written notice of the \nsuspension to the studentโs parent, which shall include, among other things, (1) the fact that the \nstudent has been suspended and the duration of the suspension; (2) the specific reasons for the \nsuspension including the date, time and place of the incident; (3) the alternative education \narrangements that have been made; (4) the date, time, and place of the hearing; (5) the fact that the \nparent may plead no contest to the charges and that such plea will result in waiving the suspension \nhearing; (6) the right to view and obtain a copy of the studentโs records, and all written statements \nrelating to the incident which led to the suspension; (7) the right to, โand the advisability ofโ, \nrepresentation by an advisor or counsel; (8) the names of adult and student witnesses who may be \nexpected to testify on behalf of the school; (9) the right to question witnesses, present witnesses \nand documentary evidence on the studentโs behalf; (10) the right to appeal the suspension decision; \nand (12) a list of community agencies offering free or low-cost legal assistance.12 \n31.  At the hearing, school officials are responsible for proving by direct or circumstantial \nevidence the studentโs involvement in the incident charged. However, a finding that the student \ncommitted the infraction may not be based exclusively on hearsay evidence.13 Although no \nstandard of proof is established by statute or regulation, drawing on ยง 306(1) of the State \nAdministrative Procedure Act (โSAPAโ), decisions of the New York State Commissioner of \nEducation, and a 2002 Appellate Division case, Board of Education of City School District of City \nof New York v.

Once findings of fact have been made as to whether the student committed the act charged, \nthe Superintendent must make a dispositional decision which will include a determination of \nwhether to overturn or sustain the suspension, the length of the suspension, and how long the \nsuspension will remain on the studentโs record. Mitigating circumstances must be considered in \nmaking a dispositional decision.15 The parent must be informed within two school days of the \ndispositional decision. The parent must also receive a full report of the findings and disposition \nwithin five school days of the hearing.16 \n33. If the charge is sustained, the disposition can range anywhere from immediate \nreinstatement to expulsion from the New York City Public School System, with most students \nreceiving a suspension of between 5 and 20 school days.17 \n34. If the charge is sustained, disposition with respect to the studentโs record may include \nnotation of the suspension on the studentโs permanent record, with the potential for expungement \nof the record upon graduation, permanent departure from the New York City public school system, \nor at some event/time in the future.18 \n \n14 See Matter of Board of Education. of City School Dist. Of City of N.Y. v. Mills, 293 A.D. 2d 37, 38-40 (2002). In \nconcluding that โsubstantial and competent evidenceโ standard was constitutionally permissible, the courtโs analysis \nerred by 1) conflating the standard imposed by reviewing courts on appeal with that applied by finders of fact; 2) \nfinding that the standard is โimposed by statuteโ in reference to the SAPA, when the Act merely references it as an \navailable option in administrative proceedings; 3) finding that school discipline hearings fail the โstigma plusโ test, a \ntest wholly inapplicable in this context given the clear property interests students have in their education; and 4) \nconcluding, without engaging in any meaningful Mathews v. Eldrige balancing analysis, that the โuse of the competent \nand substantial evidence standard [does not risk] an erroneous deprivation of the studentโs liberty and property \ninterests.โ Id. at 40. \n15 Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 ยง III.B.3(u). \n16 Id. \n17 See N.Y.C.

During the suspension, the student โmay not be penalized academically.โ19 The student \nmust be provided with alternative instruction. This instruction โmust provide the student with an \nopportunity to continue to earn academic credit and must be appropriate to the individual needs of \nthe student.โ20  \n36. Elementary and middle school students awaiting a suspension hearing must be provided \nwith a full-time instructional program, and high school students must be provided with a minimum \nof three hours per day of instruction.21 This instruction may be provided before school hours, after \nschool hours or during school hours. Once the suspension hearing has been held, all students must \nbe provided with a full-time instructional program.22 \n37. A student may appeal the decision in a Superintendentโs Suspension.51 The Chancellor \nshall decide an appeal for a suspension based on the record of the hearing and the written decision \nof the preceding reviewing authority. A decision must be issued within fifteen working days \nfollowing the completed filing of the appeal record.23 \n38. Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 also outlines the required processes and protections for \nstudents with disabilities facing disciplinary action.24  \nContinuum of Special Education  \n39. Students with disabilities are suspended at significantly higher rates than their non-disabled \npeers, although the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (โIDEAโ), 20 U.S.C. ยง 1400 et. \nseq., provides additional procedures for these students prior to and during disciplinary exclusion.25 \n \n19 Id. ยง III.B.1(a). \n20 Id. ยง III.B.1(b). \n21 Id. ยง III.B.1(e); See also N.Y.

The IDEA requires all schools to provide a free appropriate public education (โFAPEโ) to \nchildren with disabilities designed to meet their unique needs.26 To ensure the provision of a \nFAPE, all school districts must provide special education and related services โreasonably \ncalculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.โ27  \n41. To administer these services, school districts must create an individualized education \nprogram (โIEPโ) for each student with a disability. An IEP is a document created annually that \nnotes the studentโs present educational performance, outlines goals for the student to meet to \nimprove that performance, and describes the specifically designed special education and related \nservices, such as counseling, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy, that will \nsupport the student in reaching those goals.28 The IEP also notates the classroom program for the \nstudent, which must be the least restrictive environment that allows a student to make meaningful \nprogress.29  \n42. To qualify for services under the IDEA, a child must have a disability that adversely affects \nhis or her educational performance.30 The child then is classified as falling under one of 13 \ndisability categories.31  \n43. Before suspending a student with a disability, principals must consult the New York City \nSchools Discipline Code, as well as the studentโs IEP, behavioral intervention plan (โBIPโ), and \n \n26 20 U.S.C. ยง 1400(d)(1). \n27 Gagliardo v.

These settings include general education classrooms, integrated co-teaching (โICTโ) \nclassrooms where half of the students are general education students and half of the students are those with disabilities, \nand smaller classroom sizes in both community and specialized schools with ratios such as 12, 8, or 6 students to one \nteacher. \n30 See N.Y.

A disciplinary change in placement for purposes of the IDEA occurs when a student with a \ndisability either (1) receives a suspension that is greater than 10 consecutive school days or (2) is \nsubjected to a series of classroom removals or suspensions constituting a pattern which results in \nthe student being excluded from his or her classroom for more than 10 school days in the school \nyear.33 \n45. During the first 10 days of the disciplinary change in placement, special education students \nare not entitled to receive any special education services.34  \n46.  Every time a disciplinary change in placement occurs, the school district is required to \nhold a manifestation determination review (โMDRโ).35 The purpose of an MDR is to determine (1) \nwhether the conduct for which the student was suspended was caused by, or had a direct and \nsubstantial relationship to, the studentโs disabilities and (2) whether the conduct was the direct \nresult of the schoolโs failure to properly implement a studentโs IEP. 36  If the answer to either \nquestion is yes, the student must be immediately returned to the school placement from which they \nwere removed.37  \n47. The addition of an MDR to the school disciplinary process delays the issuance of the \ndecision as to whether the suspension has been sustained and often delays the student returning to \nschool.

Despite additional procedures for students with disabilities, the delayed implementation of \nsuch protections obstructs any immediate or meaningful mitigation of the harm caused by their \nexclusion from their IEP-mandated classroom placement and related services. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n49. Exclusionary school discipline practices involve punishments that remove students from \ntheir classrooms or school environments. Examples include classroom removals, which can last \nanywhere from one minute to one day; suspensions, where students are removed from their usual \nclass setting for somewhere between a day and a year; and expulsions, where students are \npermanently removed from their assigned schools. \n50. In New York City, classroom removals are called โteacher removals,โ suspensions of one \nto five days are called โprincipalโs suspensions,โ and suspensions longer than five days are called \nโsuperintendentโs suspensions.โ39 Only students at risk of receiving a superintendentโs suspension \nare entitled to the procedural protections described supra. \nHistory & Current State of Exclusionary Discipline \n51. A boom of exclusionary discipline began with rising fears about school safety that \nculminated in the passage of the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994, which required school districts to \nenact policies mandating expulsion for students found on school property with firearms.40 By \n \n38 See Chancellorโs Regulation A-443 ยง II.E.2. \n39 CITYWIDE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS at 14. \n40 See 20 U.S.C. ยง 7961 (1994). \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 13 of 38\n1999, 94% of all schools in the United States had adopted โzero-toleranceโ policies โโ a \ndisciplinary approach that favors mandatory and severe punishment regardless of individual \ncircumstances โโ that expanded far beyond addressing firearm offenses, encouraging the \nimplementation of harsher disciplinary policies for far lesser offenses as well.41 \n52. Nationally, the number of suspensions peaked in the early 2010s. During the 2009-2010 \nschool year, 7% of all students in the United States were suspended, totaling over 3.5 million \nstudents, and resulting in over 18 million days of lost instruction.42  \n53. Under President Barack Obamaโs administration, the United States Department of \nEducation (โUS DOEโ) began to investigate the short- and long-term impacts of exclusionary \ndiscipline on suspended students and their peers. In 2011, the US DOE and Department of Justice \n(โDOJโ) launched the Support School Discipline Initiative with the goal of reducing exclusionary \ndiscipline in schools.43 Under this initiative, the Council of State Governments created the 2014 \nSchool Discipline Consensus Report, designed to support districts in moving away from zero-\ntolerance policies and towards research-based, restorative practices.44 In 2014, the US DOE and \nDOJ issued a Dear Colleague Letter to assist schools in their administration of student discipline \n \n41 See JUSTIN DRIVER, THE SCHOOLHOUSE GATE: PUBLIC EDUCATION, THE SUPREME COURT, AND THE BATTLE FOR \nTHE AMERICAN MIND 145 (2018). \n42 Donna St. George, Suspended Students Lose Millions of Days of Instruction While Out of School, WASH.

While the NCLB had incentivized states to adopt \nzero-tolerance policies, ESSA created incentives for schools to transition away from exclusionary \ndiscipline.47 As of 2021, thirty-seven states had released guidance encouraging the use of non-\npunitive alternatives to suspension.48  \n54. The NYC DOE encourages the use of these alternatives in the Mission Statement on \nSchool Climate and Safety that opens the Student Discipline Code: โNew York City believes that \noverly punitive methods of discipline are not in the best interests of students, fail to advance school \nsafety, and can harm studentsโ long-term potential.โ49 It states that โresearch has shown that \nstudents facing disciplinary measures, and the schools they attend, are better served by providing \npositive supports that teach students the social, emotional, and behavioral skills necessary to \nparticipate and learn.โ50  \n \n45 See Catherine E.

Forty-six states, including New York State, have limitations on the length of suspensions, \ngrade level at which a student can be suspended, or type of violation for which a student can be \nsuspended.51 In New York City, the NYC DOE implemented a policy that caps most suspensions \nat twenty school days. Suspensions for more than twenty school days โmay be imposed only when \nrequired by law or for . . . infractions that involve seriously dangerous and/or violent behavior \nwhere the circumstances warrant the imposition of a longer suspensionโ and to impose such a \nsuspension โrequire[s] approval by the Senior Executive Director of the Office of Safety and \nYouth Development.โ52 Only general education students aged seventeen or older can be expelled \nfrom the New York City Public School System.53 \n56. Despite contemporary understandings about the significant short- and long-term impacts of \nexclusionary discipline, suspensions continue to be frequently used and disproportionately \nimposed on Black students and students with disabilities. During the 2023-2024 school year, in \nNew York City public schools, there were 36,539 disciplinary removals, comprised of 8,815 \nteacher removals, 21,493 principalโs suspensions, and 6,231 superintendentโs suspensions.54 Black \nstudents accounted for 37% of all disciplinary removals and 45% of all superintendentโs \nsuspensions, even though they comprised only 24% of the student population.55 Students with \n \n51 See EDUC.

While school suspensions were once thought of as minor, necessary punishments to remedy \na broad range of student infractions and keep schools safe and effective, they are now seen as often \nhaving the opposite impact. Students face wide-ranging harms due to suspensions, from decreased \nacademic performance to greater likelihood of absenteeism, dropout, and future incarceration. In a \nstudy of 804 New York City public schools from 2011 to 2013, 61% of disciplined students were \nchronically absent in the period after their initial suspension, 22% were not promoted to the next \ngrade, and 20% had a future arrest.57 \n \n56 See STUDENT DISCIPLINE โ ANNUAL REPORT ON STUDENT DISCIPLINE 2023-2024, \nhttps://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/student-discipline---annual-report-on-student-\ndiscipline-2023-24435e836e-d776-452c-b9a7-b655d1675be9.xlsx [https://perma.cc/A5YG-CEVC] (last visited Apr. \n28, 2025). This disparity becomes the starkest for Black students with disabilities: In a Task Force Report published by \nthe New York State Education Department in 2022, Black male students with disabilities were found to be more than \ntwo times more likely to be suspended as their white peers with disabilities, and almost ten times more likely to be \nsuspended as a white student without a disability.

Similarly, the U.S. Government Accountability \nOffice in 2024 found that Black girls were over five times more likely than their white peers to receive an out-of-\nschool suspension, and Black girls with disabilities were over ten times more likely to receive an out-of-school \nsuspension compared to white girls without a disability.

When students miss school days, they miss critical instructional time as well as time to \nform positive relationships with teachers and peers, often leading to school disengagement that \nexacerbates any preexisting behavioral difficulties and mental health concerns the students may \nhave.58 Just attending a school with more severe discipline policies leads to higher levels of \ndepressive symptoms and substance abuse in the entire student population.59  \n59. School disengagement stemming from suspension leads to further school absences that can \ndevelop into chronic absenteeism. The missed classroom time and opportunities to create and \nmaintain positive relationships with peers and teachers immediately impacts a suspended studentโs \ngrades and likelihood of grade retention. Even just one suspension on average lowers a studentโs \ngrade point average (โGPAโ) by close to one full point.60  Suspended students are nearly 30% more \nlikely to repeat a grade.61  \n60. Exclusionary discipline also has a labeling effect on disciplined students, marking them as \ntroublemakers, which is more likely to lead to further discipline through increased monitoring, the \npresumption of wrongdoing, and grouping with like-labeled peers.62 \n \n58 See CHRISTINA LICALSI, DAVID OSHER, PAUL BAILEY, BRIEF: AN EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF \nSUSPENSION AND SUSPENSION SEVERITY ON BEHAVIORAL AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES 1 (2021), \nhttps://www.air.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/NYC-Suspension-Effects-Behavioral-Academic-Outcomes-Brief-\nAugust-2021.pdf [https://perma.cc/72FF-L7J5] (Explaining that in a study of New York City Public Schools data from \n2009-2018, more severe discipline in the form of out-of-school suspensions appeared to exacerbate misbehavior, as \nthese students exhibited higher rates of behavioral incidents for the four years after the initial incident as compared to \ntheir peers who received shorter in-school suspensions). \n59 See Seth J.

When students are excluded from school, not only do they miss out on academic and social \nlearning opportunities, but they can also be deprived of nutrition and healthcare to which they are \nstatutorily entitled. The NYC DOE offers free breakfast, lunch, and after school meals to all \nstudents, operating the largest daily food program in the country outside of the military.63 During \nthe 2023-2024 school year, every public school in New York City, according to city officials, had \na nurse or school-based health center.64 During the 2020-2021 school, 400 schools had health \nclinics that offered mental health services.65  \n62.

Without adequate nutrition and needed mental health support, students are more likely to \ncontinue to exhibit negative behaviors and continue to be kept out of school, creating a vicious \ncycle. \n63. In New York City, while students await their suspension hearing and for the entire length \nof the suspension, they are offered an opportunity to attend alternative learning centers (โALCsโ). \nThere are 12 Middle School and 12 High School ALCs in the New York City Schools system, and \nmost students must travel significant distances via public transportation to get to their assigned \nlocation; the NYC DOE does not provide busing. There are only four principals designated to lead \nall 24 ALC schools, and only nine โcore staff membersโ per school.69 \n64. Because these schools are not included in the cityโs school quality reports, there is little \ninformation about their safety or impact on student performance. ALCs are inadequate substitutes \nfor the regular classroom: they are, by their nature, always temporary, and the transient nature of \nthe student population makes it difficult to have any coherent or consistent curriculum. Students \nreturn to their home school behind in the curriculum, and oftentimes the credits they earned at the \nALC do not transfer. When students are placed in an ALC, their chances of graduating from high \nschool decrease significantly.70 There is also an increased risk of danger and disruption due to \nmany students with behavioral difficulties being placed together in one setting. \n65.

Just \none suspension in the ninth grade increases two-fold the likelihood that a student will drop out.72 \nOnce a student has been disciplined by removal over ten times, the likelihood of dropout rises to \nnearly 60%.73 Suspensions lower graduation rates not just for the suspended students, but for all \nstudents at schools with high suspension rates.74 \n67. The impact of exclusionary discipline does not stop at the proverbial โschoolhouse gate.โ \nSuspended students are nearly three times as likely as their non-suspended peers to be in contact \nwith the juvenile justice system the year after the disciplinary incident, and for students suspended \nover ten times, the likelihood of future incarceration jumps to nearly 50%.75 The severity of the \ndisciplinary incident does not impact the likelihood of incarceration, demonstrating that the \nincrease is not primarily driven by the underlying behaviors, but rather by the imposition of the \nsuspensions themselves.76 \n \n71 Alex Zimmerman, โItโs Basically Jailโ: Inside NYCโs Suspension Centers, Where Thereโs Bullying, Boredom โ and \nSometimes Support, CHALKBEAT (Apr. 18, 2019), https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2019/4/18/21107994/it-s-\nbasically-jail-inside-nyc-s-suspension-centers-where-there-s-bullying-boredom-and-sometimes-sup \n[https://perma.cc/ZK4E-Y8ZL]. \n72 See Robert Balfanz et al., Sent Home and Put Off-Track: The Antecedents, Disproportionalities, and Consequences \nof Being Suspended in the Ninth Grade, J.

The likelihood of future incarceration increases not just for suspended students, but for \ntheir peers as well: all middle school students who attend schools with high suspension rates are \nsubstantially more likely to be arrested and jailed as adults.77 \n69. Student suspensions predict future civil and political disengagement: excluded students feel \nmarginalized, unheard, and undervalued which encourages the learning of anti-democratic values \nand behaviors.78  \n70. Student suspensions also economically impact society at large. When students are retained \nin a grade, their workforce entry is delayed, costing the state over $68 million dollars in one year.79 \nThe additional years of instruction cost the state nearly $41 million dollars per year.80 \n71. Taken together, these impacts reflect the seriousness of the interests at stake when a student \nis suspended from school. \nFacts Regarding the Individual Plaintiffs \nY.H. \n72.  Y.H. is a 13-year-old 8th grade student at IS 96 Bay Academy. When Y.H. was suspended \nduring the 2023-2024 school year, he was a 7th grade student at the same school.  \n73.

On June 18, 2024, at 10:10 a.m., Y.H. was traveling with a friend, M.B., from their usual \nclassroom on the fourth floor of the school building to the auditorium on the first floor. They \nstopped on the second floor to get water from a water fountain.  \n75.  Howard Weiner, a school aide (โSAโ) and hall monitor, was seated directly across the hall \nfrom the water fountain on the second floor. As Y.H. and M.B. walked towards the fountain, a \nteacher, Ms. Alfonso, passed Mr. Weiner and said, โhey babe.โ This comment prompted Y.H. to \nask Mr. Weiner, โare you two dating?โ Mr. Weiner responded, โthatโs none of your business.โ \n76.  Y.H. then proceeded to drink from the water fountain. \n77.  Mr. Weiner stood up to direct Y.H. and M.B. to leave the hallway and go to their class. He \nstood with M.B. directly behind Y.H. at the water fountain. \n78.  As Y.H. was still facing the fountain, Mr. Weiner told the students to take one of the \nโdownโ staircases to class (there were several staircases, each of which had a set direction of \nmovement).  \n79.  Because Y.H. had not been looking at Mr. Weiner when he directed them to a particular \nstaircase, Y.H. pointed his finger in the direction he thought Mr. Weiner meant and turned around. \nAs he turned around, the tip of Y.H.โs finger brushed Mr. Weinerโs face. Neither Mr. Weiner nor \nM.B. saw Y.H.โs motion, but Mr. Weiner felt the brush against his cheek. \n80.  Mr. Weiner immediately asked Y.H., โwhy did you hit me?โ Y.H. responded, โIโm sorry, it \nwas by mistake.โ Mr. Weiner then took out his radio and asked all deans to report to the second \nfloor for backup. Mr. Weiner then returned to his chair. \n81.  Assistant principal (โAPโ) Goldberg arrived, and Mr. Weiner told him that Y.H. had hit \nhim. Y.H. was taken to AP Goldbergโs office, where Y.H. explained that as he was turning around \n  22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 23 of 38\nfrom the water fountain, his finger had accidentally lightly touched Mr. Weinerโs face. Despite the \nclarification, AP Goldberg accused Y.H. of striking a teacher intentionally.  \n82.   H.H., Y.H.โs mother, was called and told to pick Y.H. up from school because he had \nreceived a superintendentโs suspension. When H.H. arrived at the school, she asked to speak with \nthe principal and sent Y.H., who had been brought to meet her, back to class. After initially \ndenying H.H.โs request, the principal met with H.H. and accused Y.H. of pushing Mr. Weiner to \nthe ground โ an allegation that was completely unsupported by any evidence. The principal \nappeared angry at H.H. for sending Y.H. back to class, and both H.H. and Y.H. were shortly \nthereafter escorted from the building. They were told to await further instruction. \n83.  On June 20, 2024, H.H. received a letter stating that Y.H. was suspended from Bay \nAcademy beginning immediately due to his presence in the school posing a continuing danger โto \npersons or property or an ongoing threat of disruption to the academic progress.โ \n84.  Y.H. was charged with engaging in acts that constituted a โdanger to the health, safety, \nwelfare, and moralsโ of himself and others at the school when he โasked SA Weiner if he was \ndating Teacher Alfonso and then struck SA Weiner in the face.โ \n85.  The letter informed H.H. that a Superintendentโs Suspension Hearing would be held at the \nBrooklyn/Staten Island Office of Student Suspensions on June 26, 2024, the last day of the 2024-\n2025 schoolyear. \n86.  In the interim, the letter instructed H.H. to send Y.H. to an alternative learning center \n(โALCโ), Albany, located in Brooklyn, New York. \n87.  H.H. did not feel comfortable sending her son to a school and neighborhood she did not \nknow. Out of concern for his safety, H.H. did not send Y.H. to the ALC while they waited for the \nhearing. \n  23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 24 of 38\n88.  A hearing was held on June 26, 2024, in front of Hearing Officer Michelle Parker (โHO \nParkerโ). Bronx Legal Services appeared with Y.H. and his parent as counsel. Mr. Sean OโNeill, \nthe Assistant Principal, presented the case on behalf of the school. The school brought only one \nwitness, Mr. Weiner.  \n89.  Y.H. had been charged under the Student Code of Conduct with a B-52, which is โusing \nforce against or inflicting or attempting to inflict serious injury against school personnel.โ 81 \n90.  Mr. Weiner testified that he had observed Y.H. and M.B. walking in the hallway and had \ninstructed them to go to class. He testified that Ms. Alfonso had said, โhey baby!โ to him, and then \nY.H., who was at the water fountain, asked whether they were dating. Mr. Weiner testified that he \nresponded that it was none of Y.H.โs business and then Y.H., who was standing very close to Mr. \nWeiner, slapped him on the left cheek. Mr. Weiner testified that he did not see what happened \nbefore the contact. He testified that while he believed the slap was intentional, he had no specific \nreasons to believe that was the case. \n91.  Mr. Weiner testified that he did not receive medical attention or sustain any redness to his \nface. \n92.  Y.H. did not testify himself, but his written statement was submitted as part of the schoolโs \nevidence. It said: โMrs. Alfonso said hey babe to Mr. Howard and I asked Mr. Howard if heโs \ndating her and he started laughing then when I went to get water my arm swung and my finger tip \nhit the side of his face by accident and I apologized and said it was by mistake.โ \n93.  In her closing statement, Y.H.โs attorney argued that the classification of a B-52 was \ninappropriate given that the touch had left no marks and required no medical attention. She argued \n \n81 See CITYWIDE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS at 42. The Discipline Code groups infractions into five levels based on \nthe severity of the infraction, and gives each infraction type a distinct number from 1 to 62. For each code, there is a \nset level of possible consequences. Level 4 and 5 infractions can result in the longest possible suspensions. See id. at \n31 โ 43. \n  24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 25 of 38\nthat there was no evidence presented that showed that Y.H. intentionally hit Mr. Weiner. Y.H.โs \nwritten statement explained that any contact had been accidental, and the presenting dean testified \nthat Y.H. had said the same to all school personnel on the day of the incident. \n94.  The school requested that Y.H. be suspended for 21-39 days.  \n95.  On June 28, 2024, H.H. received a letter stating that Y.H.โs suspension was sustained. \nDespite the evidence presented of the accidental and light nature of the contact between H.H. and \nMr. Weiner, Hearing Officer Parker wrote that substantial and competent evidence had been \npresented to sustain the charge that โRespondent Y.H. had asked SA Weiner if the SA is dating \nTeacher Alfonsoโ and โRespondent struck SA Weiner in the face.โ \n96.  The suspension was sustained for 16 school days. Y.H. would not be able to return to his \nschool, Bay Academy, until three weeks into the new school year, on September 23, 2024. \n97.  Y.H. and his mother were distraught at the thought of Y.H. missing the beginning of his 8th \ngrade year. H.H. feared that if Y.H. missed the first three week of classes, he would never catch up \nacademically. \n98.  During the second week of July, H.H. received a call from someone who worked at an \nalternative learning center (โALCโ) asking if Y.H. would be attending summer school. H.H. was \nconfused because Y.H. had passed all his classes. The ALC staff member told H.H. that if Y.H. \nwent to summer school, he could potentially serve all his suspension days such that he could return \nto Bay Academy for the first day of 8th grade.  \n99.  Y.H. attended the summer school and was therefore able to start 8th grade with his peers. \nHowever, it was a significant burden on Y.H. and H.H. to drive Y.H. to an ALC on Staten Island \nevery day and prevented them from participating in other summer plans they had scheduled. \n100. The suspension remains on Y.H.โs academic record.  \n  25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 26 of 38\n \nY.P. \n101. Y.P. is a 14-year-old 9th grade student with a disability. When Y.P. was suspended in \nMarch 2024, she was in 8th grade at I.S. 96 Seth Low Intermediate School in Brooklyn, New York. \n102. Y.P. has an individualized education program (โIEPโ) with a disability classification of \nlearning disability.82  She attends school in an integrated co-teaching (โICTโ) classroom and \nreceives the related service of counseling in a group one time per week for 40 minutes. \n103. On March 28th, 2024, Y.P. walked to school with two peers. As they were walking, one \nstudent, R.U., removed a vape pen from his pocket and took a puff. R.U. then attempted to put the \nvape pen in Y.P.โs sweater pocket, explaining that he was concerned he would get searched that \nday and did not want it on his person. Y.P. said no and pushed his hand away.  \n104. Y.P. and R.U. entered the school building and went to their shared first period class. \nBecause it was a testing day, all students were instructed to put their bags at the back of the \nclassroom. Y.P. placed her bag alongside the other studentsโ bags and sat at a desk located towards \nthe front of the classroom, approximately eleven feet away from her backpack. R.U. sat three or \nfour desk rows behind Y.P., near the bags in the back of the classroom.  \n105. Approximately five minutes after the start of class, Rakym Felder, a school aide, entered \nthe classroom and asked Y.P. to come with him. He had been instructed to escort Y.P. to another \nclassroom for testing.  \n106. Y.P. stood up and went to retrieve her bag from the back of the classroom. She grabbed the \nbag and walked towards Mr. Felder. As she passed R.U.โs desk, R.U. signaled to Y.P.โs bag with \nhis hands and whispered โgive it to me. Give me the vape.โ  \n \n82 See supra ยถ 41. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 27 of 38\n107. Y.P. stopped, opened her bag, and saw that there were two vape pens lying on top of her \nother schoolbooks. She had not known they were there. As Y.P. attempted to hand the vape pens to \nR.U., Mr. Felder grabbed them from her hand.  \n108. Mr. Felder then took Y.P. to the school deanโs office. When asked what happened, Y.P. \ntold a dean, as well as several other school officials, that she had no knowledge of the presence of \nthe vape pens in her bag and believed them to belong to R.U.  \n109. R.F., Y.P.โs mother, was called and told to come get Y.P. immediately and await further \ninstruction. \n110. On April 2, 2024, R.F. received a letter stating that Y.P. was suspended from her school, \nSeth Low, beginning immediately due to her presence in the school posing a continuing danger โto \npersons or property or an ongoing threat of disruption to the academic progress.โ \n111. Despite the DOEโs awareness that R.F.โs primary language is Spanish, the suspension letter \nwas written only in English.  \n112. Y.P. was charged with engaging in acts that constituted a โdanger to the health, safety, \nwelfare, and moralsโ of herself and others at the school when on March 28, 2024, she โwas in \npossession of a controlled substance, to wit: a vape pen containing marijuana.โ \n113. The letter informed R.F. that a Superintendentโs Suspension Hearing would be held at the \nBrooklyn/Staten Island Office of Student Suspensions on April 9, 2024. \n114. In the interim, the letter instructed R.F. to send Y.P. to serve her suspension at the \nalternative learning center (โALCโ), Albany, located in Brooklyn, New York.  \n115. To get to the ALC on her own, Y.P. would have had to travel for nearly an hour on two \nsubways. R.F. did not feel comfortable with Y.P. traveling that far alone, so she drove Y.P. to and \nfrom the ALC every day, placing a significant burden on the familyโs schedule. \n  27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 28 of 38\n116. At the ALC, the schoolwork consisted of a series of worksheets that Y.P. was to complete \non her own, unrelated to the subjects Y.P. was learning at her usual school. Y.P. was told she could \neither complete them while she sat in a classroom at the ALC or take them home to do later. \nTeachers at the ALC did not teach lessons in a group format. Some days, Y.P. was told she could \npick up the worksheets and leave immediately to go back home. Y.P. did not receive her IEP-\nmandated counseling while she was placed at the ALC. \n117. After adjourning the first hearing date to retain counsel, a hearing was held on April 15, \n2024, in front of Hearing Officer Michelle Parker (โHO Parkerโ). Bronx Legal Services appeared \nwith Y.P. and her parent as counsel. Tina Markland, the dean of Seth Low, presented the case and \ntestified on behalf of the school. The school brought only one eyewitness, Mr. Felder.  \n118. Mr. Felder testified that on March 28th, 2024, he had been tasked with escorting Y.P. from \nher classroom to another classroom for testing. He testified that when he arrived in the classroom \nand called for Y.P., she was sitting in her chair and her bag was on the back of her chair. Mr. \nFelder testified that Y.P. stood up, grabbed her bag, and as she walked toward Mr. Felder, Y.P. \nreached inside her bag to remove two items and attempted to hand them to another student. The \nother student would not take them and said โNo, Iโm not getting into trouble.โ \n119. Dean Markland testified that when Y.P. entered her office with Mr. Felder, she had two \nvape pens in her hand. Dean Markland testified that when Y.P. was asked where the pens came \nfrom, she stated that they were R.U.โs. Upon looking at the items, Dean Markland determined that \none pen was empty and the other had liquid inside it. She then gave the pens to a school safety \nagent. No further tests were performed on the pens to determine their contents. \n120. No photos of the vape pens or verified information about their contents were entered as \nevidence at the hearing. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 29 of 38\n121. Y.P. testified on her own behalf. As described above, she testified in relevant part that \nwhile walking to school, she saw R.U. take a hit of his vape pen and then attempt to put it in Y.P.โs \nsweater pocket. After entering their first period classroom, Y.P. placed her bag at the back of the \nclassroom and sat down at her desk. Y.P. testified that when Mr. Felder called for her to come with \nhim, she returned to the back of the classroom to grab her bag and that as she walked past R.U., he \nwhispered to her, โgive me the vapesโ while gesturing towards her bag.  \n122. Y.P. testified that her bag is like a pocketbook, in that it is mostly open at the top with a \nmagnetic clasp in the middle.  \n123. The school requested that Y.P. be suspended for 16-20 days.  \n124. On April 18, 2024, R.F. received a call stating that Y.P.โs suspension had been sustained \nfor 10 school days. \n125. Despite Y.P.โs testimony that the pens were not hers and the lack of any evidence presented \nas to the contents of the liquid in the pen, or any images of the actual items, Hearing Officer Parker \nfound that substantial and competent evidence had been presented to sustain the charges that Y.P. \nwas in possession of โa controlled substance, namely liquid THC in a vape pen, and in possession \nof drug paraphernalia, namely an empty vape pen.โ \n126. The extended period for which Y.P. was excluded from school deepened her preexisting \nacademic struggles. At the time of the suspension, Y.P. was failing four out of her six courses. She \nbegan to exhibit chronic absenteeism due to a lack of motivation to attend school. She was told \nthroughout the rest of the 2023-2024 school year that she likely would not graduate 8th grade with \nher peers. \n127. Y.P. was prohibited from attending the 8th grade prom and class trip to Six Flags as further \npunishments, two rites of passage that she had been looking forward to. \n  29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 30 of 38\n128. Y.P. and R.F. were not told until the morning of graduation that Y.P. would in fact be \npermitted to graduate. Y.P. was unable to enjoy this momentous day because of the significant \nanxiety the uncertainty had caused her, and the embarrassment of showing up late to the ceremony \ndue to the last-minute notification, a clear indication that she almost failed the 8th grade. \n129. Since the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year, Y.P. has continued to struggle with \nmotivation to attend school. R.F. must drive Y.P. to school every day because she will not go \notherwise. R.F. is also considering transferring Y.P. to a charter school in the hopes that a change \nmight make Y.P. excited to go to school again. Y.P. is currently failing all her classes, except for \nart, and her promotion to the 10th grade is in doubt. \nH.C. \n130. H.C. is a 12-year-old 7th grade student with a disability classification of emotional \ndisability (โEDโ). She attends a community school in a self-contained 12:1 special education \nclassroom and receives the related service of counseling twice a week, once individually and once \nin a group. \n131. When H.C. was suspended in December 2024, she attended Pugsley Preparatory Academy \n(โPugsleyโ) in the Bronx, New York, and had a disability classification of learning disability \n(โLDโ).  \n132. At the beginning of the 2024-2025 schoolyear, H.C. began to exhibit disruptive behaviors \nin the classroom. To identify and implement additional supports for H.C., Timothy Woo, H.C.โs \nguidance counselor, conducted a functional behavioral assessment (โFBAโ), a process used to \nunderstand, via observation and analysis, how and why a student engages in behaviors that impede \n  30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 31 of 38\nhis or her learning.83  The FBA noted that H.C. was most likely to exhibit problem behaviors such \nas using combative and inappropriate language when she is given a directive โ such as to put her \nphone away โ or told to perform a non-preferred or difficult task.  \n133. On December 4, 2024, around 12:50 p.m., H.C. was upset about a comment made by a \nfriend and was speaking with Mr. Woo outside of his office. H.C. frequently spoke to Mr. Woo \nwhen she felt emotionally overwhelmed. Ms. Went, H.C.โs classroom teacher, called from across \nthe hallway for H.C. to come to class because the class period had started. \n134. H.C. entered the classroom and went to her assigned desk. The class was doing a quiet \nassignment for the beginning of the period. H.C. still felt upset, and therefore asked Ms. Went if \nshe could look at her phone for a few minutes, a common coping mechanism used by H.C. Ms. \nWent gave H.C. permission to take out her phone. \n135. Melanie Robles, an English Language Learner teacher, was nearby working with another \nstudent. Ms. Robles is not usually in Ms. Wentโs classroom and does not work with H.C. \n136. Although Ms. Went had just given H.C. permission to be on her phone, Ms. Robles said to \nH.C., โlittle girl, get off your phone.โ When H.C. did not respond, Ms. Robles continued to \ncommand H.C., with continuing intensity, and the repeated use of the phrase โlittle girl,โ to put her \nphone away.  \n137. Because Ms. Robles would not stop demanding that H.C. put her phone away, H.C. said to \nMs. Robles, โLeave me aloneโ and Ms. Robles responded, โNot today, H.C.โ H.C. became \nextremely upset, got up from her seat, and began pacing around the classroom. Ms. Robles stood \n \n83 This document is then used to create a behavioral intervention plan (โBIPโ) which includes a description of the \npurpose and antecedents of studentโs maladaptive behaviors as well as actions school staff can take to reduce triggers \nof behaviors and to address behaviors once they occur. \n  31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 32 of 38\nand continued to berate H.C., calling her a โbitch.โ After being called a โbitchโ by Ms. Robles, \nH.C. responded with profanities herself and called Ms. Robles a โbitch.โ  \n138. Seeing that the situation was escalating and H.C. was in crisis, Ms. Went called the \nassistant principalโs office to ask for assistance and asked another student to go get Mr. Woo from \nhis office. Mr. Woo entered the classroom shortly thereafter. \n139. As H.C. stood at the back of the room, she told Ms. Robles that she would spit on her. Ms. \nRobles mockingly responded, โooh, so scared,โ which further upset H.C. H.C. then spit towards \nMs. Robles from approximately six feet away.  \n140. Ms. Robles then initiated a physical altercation, lunging towards H.C., grabbing her hair, \nand beginning to punch H.C. while the students in the classroom watched.  \n141. Mr. Woo attempted to step between H.C. and Ms. Robles. He faced Ms. Robles and told \nher to stop hitting H.C. Eventually, after approximately one minute, Mr. Woo was able to separate \nMs. Robles and H.C. In separating them, he injured his right hip. \n142. H.C. was removed from the classroom and taken to Mr. Wooโs office, where Mr. Woo \nobserved a cut on the right side of her neck and a cut on her upper lip.  \n143. Mr. Woo called H.C.โs mother, N.T., to let her know that there had been an incident, but \nN.T. was unable to pick H.C. up right away. H.C. remained in Mr. Wooโs office until the end of \nthe school day. N.T. was then told to keep H.C. home until further notice.  \n144. Mr. Woo spoke with several students who had witnessed the attack on H.C. One, A.G., told \nMr. Woo he felt scared to come to school. Another, S.Q., told Mr. Woo that he did not want to go \nto school the next day because he feared Ms. Robles after having seen her hit H.C. in the head. \n145. On December 6, 2024, N.T. received a letter stating that H.C. was suspended from school \nbeginning immediately due to her presence in the school posing a continuing danger to โpersons or \n  32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 33 of 38\nproperty or an ongoing threat of disruption to the academic progress.โ H.C. was charged with \nengaging in acts that constituted a โdanger to the health, safety, welfare, and moralsโ of herself and \nothers at the school. The suspension letter alleged that H.C. \"engaged in harassing and intimidating \nbehavior when she stated to Teacher Ms. Robles, โshut the fuck up bitch,โ โI donโt give a fuck \nbitchโ and โfuck you bitchโโ and โengaged in physically aggressive behavior when she grabbed \nTeacher Ms. Robles by her shirt, scratched Ms. Robles in the nose, spat on Ms. Roblesโs face, and \nattempted to pull Ms. Robles to the floor.โ84 The letter informed N.T. that a suspension hearing \nwould be held on December 12, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. \n146. In the interim, the letter instructed N.T. to immediately begin sending H.C. to an alternative \nearning center (โALCโ). N.T. could not drop off or pick up H.C. at the ALC herself because she \nworks a full-time job, and did not feel comfortable sending H.C. alone on public transit to an \nunfamiliar neighborhood and school. She also was concerned that H.C.โs special education \nservices would not be provided. Therefore, N.T. decided not to send H.C. to the ALC, and H.C. \ndid not attend any school beginning on December 6, 2024. \n147. A Superintendentโs Suspension hearing was held at the Bronx Office of Student \nSuspensions on December 12, 2024. Hearing Officer Larry Arias (โHO Ariasโ) presided over the \nhearing. Niurka Grullon, the dean of Pugsley, presented the case on behalf of the school. The \nschool brought only one witness who was present at the time of the incident, Ms. Went.  Neither \nMr. Woo nor Ms. Robles were called as witnesses; nor were any other students present in the \nclassroom at the time of the incident. \n148. In her testimony, Ms. Went stated that yelling began between H.C. and Ms. Robles after \nMs. Robles told H.C. to put her phone away. She testified that it escalated very quickly. Ms. Went \n \n84 A third charge against H.C. stemming from the same incident was not sustained due to the schoolโs failure to present \nany relevant, non-hearsay evidence. \n  33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 34 of 38\ntestified that she heard H.C. say, โleave me alone.โ Ms. Robles responded, โnot today, H.C.โ H.C. \nthen said, โshut the fuck up. Leave me alone. Iโm not putting away my phone. Mind your business, \nbitch.โ She testified that she saw Ms. Robles stand up and H.C. spit towards Ms. Robles. \n149. Ms. Went testified that she did not see whether Ms. Robles or H.C. initiated contact or how \nthe physical altercation began. She testified that she did not see H.C. grab Ms. Roblesโs shirt and \nwas not sure whether H.C. ever made contact with Ms. Roblesโ face. She described the incident as \na โtussleโ and โfightโ where both H.C. and Ms. Robles were holding onto each other and could \nhave fallen to the floor. She testified that afterwards she saw a scratch on Ms. Roblesโ face.  \n150. The only other evidence submitted by the school was a set of signed written statements \nfrom Ms. Went, Ms. Robles, Mr. Woo, and four students: Y.P., J.C., A.G., and S.K. \n151. Although Ms. Went testified that she was not sure who initiated the physical altercation, \nother evidence presented at the hearing indicated that it was Ms. Robles who attacked H.C: Mr. \nWoo wrote in a statement submitted into evidence that โMs. Robles approached H.C. and began to \ngrab and punch H.C. I tried to jump between them while facing Ms. Robles and trying to tell her \nnot to do it but was unable to keep them apart.โ One student, J.C., wrote that โMs. Robles got up \nand started to fight H.C.โ Another student, S.K., wrote that โThere was a fight between a student \nand a teacher. It was a student named H.C. and a teacher named Ms. Robles. The student spit on \nthe teacherโs face. Then the teacher got mad and started hurting her and cursing H.C. out.โ  \n152. H.C. testified on her own behalf. As described above, she testified in relevant part that Ms. \nWent gave her permission to go on her phone at the beginning of class. Then, Ms. Robles \ndemanded she put her phone away several times using the language โlittle girl.โ When H.C. \ncontinued to use her phone, Ms. Robles called her a โbitch.โ H.C. became upset and told Ms. \nRobles she would spit on her, and after Ms. Robles mocked her, H.C. spit towards Ms. Robles. Ms. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 35 of 38\nRobles, who is a foot taller than H.C., then initiated the physical altercation, lunging at H.C. H.C. \ntestified that Ms. Robles grabbed her high ponytail and held onto it for approximately one minute \nwhile the two struggled. H.C. testified that apart from kicking at Ms. Robles to get her to release \nher head, she never initiated physical contact; she never swung at Ms. Robles with her hands nor \ngrabbed Ms. Roblesโs shirt. \n153. H.C. testified that she had two cuts โ one on the back of her neck and one on her lip. \nHearing Officer Arias observed these injuries during the hearing. \n154. The school requested that H.C. be suspended for 40-180 days.  \n155. A Manifestation Determination Review (โMDRโ) was held for H.C. on December 17, \n2024.  The school team ultimately concluded that the behavior was not a manifestation of H.C.โs \ndisability.  \n156. On December 19, 2024, N.T. received a letter stating that H.C.โs suspension had been \nsustained and would continue for 17 school days.  \n157. Despite the extensive evidence presented at the hearing demonstrating that the teacher had \nbeen the instigator of the verbal altercation and initiator of the physical contact, Hearing Officer \nArias found that substantial and competent evidence had been presented to sustain the charge that \nH.C. engaged in physically aggressive behavior โwhen she tussled with Teacher Ms. Robles, \nscratched Ms. Robles in the nose, spat on Ms. Roblesโs face, and attempted to pull Ms. Robles to \nthe floor.โ  He also found that H.C. engaged in โharassing and intimidating behavior when she \nstated to Teacher Ms. Robles, โshut the fuck up bitch,โ โI donโt give a fuck bitchโ and โfuck you \nbitch.โโ \n158. H.C. did not attend any school for the duration of the suspension. She began attending her \nschool, Pugsley, again on January 13, 2025. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 36 of 38\n159. Less than a week after H.C. returned to Pugsley, she received an in-school suspension for \nallegedly speaking disrespectfully to an assistant principal. She spent three days in a secluded \nclassroom. \n160. N.T. continued to receive calls from the school on a weekly basis about small infractions \nH.C. had committed. She believed that H.C. continued to lash out at teachers and administrators \ndue to the feeling that she was being unfairly punished. Mr. Woo reached out to N.T. several times \nin January and February asking when she planned to transfer H.C. to another school, leaving N.T. \nand H.C. feeling as if the school wanted H.C. gone. In March 2025, N.T. removed H.C. from \nPugsley because she felt the school was hurting H.C.โs academic potential by repeatedly singling \nher out for punishment and thus interfering with her classroom learning time.  \n161. The extended period for which H.C. was excluded from school and the continued \npunishments have deepened her academic and behavioral struggles. N.T. recently received a \nโpromotion in doubtโ letter from the NYC DOE indicating that because of H.C.โs academic \nstanding, she risks not being promoted to the 8th grade. \n162. The suspension remains on H.C.โs academic record. \nCAUSE OF ACTION \n163. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n164. Plaintiffs have property and liberty interests in their education created pursuant to Section 1 \nof Article XI of the New York Constitution. \n165. Defendants have violated Plaintiffsโ due process rights under the United States Constitution \nby subjecting them to an unconstitutional standard of proof in their student disciplinary hearings. \n  36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 37 of 38\n166. By applying a โsubstantial and competent evidenceโ standard at such hearings, Defendants \nfailed to provide adequate procedural protections proportionate to the risk of erroneous deprivation \nand the magnitude of harms tied to a long-term suspension. See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. \n319, 335 (1976). \n167. Defendantsโ failure to apply a constitutional standard of proof caused Plaintiffs to suffer \nactual damages including but not limited to mental distress, embarrassment, humiliation, physical \nassault, anxiety, emotional pain and suffering, a denial of access to educational benefit, as well as \nother economic and non-economic damages. \n168. Applying a preponderance of the evidence standard would not place any greater \nadministrative burden on Defendants but would significantly enhance procedural protections for \nvulnerable students. \n169. All Defendants are state actors acting under color of state law within the meaning of 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983. \n \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:  \nA. Declaring that the โcompetent and substantial evidenceโ standard used by Defendants is \nunconstitutional as applied to student discipline hearings for suspensions longer than five \nschool days; \nB.  Directing Defendants to employ the โpreponderance of the evidenceโ standard in all long-\nterm suspension hearings; \nC.  Awarding Plaintiffs damages in an amount to be determined at trial; \n \nD. Awarding Plaintiffs their costs and attorneysโ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and \n  37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04217-JPO     Document 3     Filed 05/21/25     Page 38 of 38\nE.  Granting such additional or further relief as the Court considers just and proper. \n \nDated: Bronx, New York \n            May 20, 2025 \n \n \n                Respectfully submitted,  \n                 \n                s/Christopher D.
