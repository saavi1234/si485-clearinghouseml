    "summary": "<p>This case is about the Trump Administration's termination of the Shelter and Services Program (SSP). After President Trump's second term began, he directed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to eliminate federal funding from \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" and terminate grants to organizations supporting \"removable or illegal aliens.\" Following this directive, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reduced Washington's SSP grant award from over $4 million to zero on February 10, 2025. This was followed by a notice of alleged noncompliance on March 11, 2025, and a final official termination of the grant on April 1, 2025, citing a new DHS policy that providing aid to migrants was inconsistent with the agency's current priorities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 2025, the State of Washington filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against DHS, FEMA, and their respective agency heads. Judge Barbara J. Rothstein was assigned to the case. Plaintiffs argued that defendants illegally and unconstitutionally terminated the SSP grant and brought claims under the:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Separation of Powers Doctrine - contending that defendants effectively nullified a congressionally created and funded program,</li>\r\n<li>Spending Clause - asserting that defendants&rsquo; actions undermined the purpose for which Congress had appropriated funds,</li>\r\n<li>Administrative Procedure Act - &nbsp;claiming that the termination was arbitrary and capricious, as defendants issued a &ldquo;sham&rdquo; notice of non-compliance and failed to provide a reasoned explanation for their decision, and</li>\r\n<li>Ultra Vires - claiming the defendants exceeded their legal authority in terminating a program specifically established by Congress.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Represented by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Washington, plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief to set aside the defendants' actions and restore the Shelter and Services Program (SSP) so that the state can continue to provide shelter and services to immigrants.</p>\r\n<p>The court ordered the parties file a joint status report and discovery plan by September 22, 2025. On September 16, 2025 the parties filed a stipulated motion and proposed order setting a new schedule briefing and hearing schedule and asking that the case be resolved through briefing cross-motions for summary judgment. The proposed schedule set a deadline of December 18, 2025 for plaintiffs to file their motion for summary judgment. The court signed the proposed order.</p>\r\n<p>On September 22, 2025 plaintiffs filed an amendment complaint with the same allegations, adding in allegations about Secretary Kristi Noem directing DHS components to place &ldquo;on hold pending review&rdquo; grant programs that &ldquo;touch in any way on immigration,&rdquo; out of &nbsp;&ldquo;concern&rdquo; these programs were funding &ldquo;illegal activities,&rdquo; like &ldquo;inducing&rdquo; or &ldquo;harboring . . . illegal aliens.&rdquo; See Secretary Noem, Memorandum for Component and Office Heads (Jan. 28, 2025). Secretary Noem, however, ordered a hold on all funds administered under the Shelter and Services Program, finding that no review of these programs was necessary prior to cutting funding.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Following President Trump’s directive to defund “sanctuary jurisdictions,” FEMA reduced Washington’s SSP award from over $4 million to zero, citing a new DHS policy deeming aid to migrants inconsistent with agency priorities. On July 25, 2025, Washington filed this lawsuit in the Western District of Washington against DHS, FEMA, and agency heads, alleging violations of the Separation of Powers Doctrine, the Spending Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs argued that the termination unlawfully nullified a congressionally funded program, was arbitrary and capricious, and exceeded defendants’ legal authority.

PROPOSED CASE PLAN \n13 \n \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND \n14 \nSECURITY, et al.,  \n \n15 \n  Defendants. \n16 \n17   STIPULATION \n18  The parties, through their respective undersigned counsel, stipulate as follows: \n19  The State of Washington filed its Complaint in this matter on July 25, 2025. \n20  Washington views this case as a challenge to actions by Defendants the U.S. Department of \n21  Homeland Security (DHS), Secretary Kristi Noem, the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n22  (FEMA), and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator David Richardson to \n23  terminate the Shelter and Services Program, through which Washington was awarded a $4,039,516 \n24  grant in FY 2024. See ECF No. 1. \n25  Defendants view this case as a challenge to Defendants’ decision to terminate Washington’s \n26  $4,039,516 grant awarded by FEMA under the Shelter and Services Program. Defendants believe \n \n \nJOINT STIPULATION AND PROPOSED  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nCASE PLAN \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNo. 2:25-cv-01401-BJR  Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 11     Filed 09/16/25     Page 2 of 5\n \n1  the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this challenge, particularly in light of the Supreme Court’s recent \n2  orders in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association, No. 25A103, 2025 \n3  WL 2415669, at *1 (U.S. Aug. 21, 2025) and Department of Education v. California, 604 U.S. 650, \n4  145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025). \n5  The parties have conferred on multiple occasions since this matter was filed and held a \n6  Zoom teleconference on September 8, 2025, to discuss the matters outlined in Rule 26(f) and the \n7  Court’s  Order Regarding  Initial  Disclosures,  Joint Status Report,  and Early Settlement.  See \n8  ECF No. 9. The parties are in agreement on the following: (1) this case is exempt from the initial \n9  disclosure requirement because it is “an action for review on an administrative record,” Fed. R. Civ. \n10  P. 26(a)(1)(B)(i); (2) settlement of this matter is not possible at present, though counsel for the \n11  parties remain open to further discussion, should an opportunity for amicable resolution arise; and \n12  (3) this case should be resolved through briefing cross-motions for summary judgment. \n13  Accordingly, the parties respectfully request that the Court enter an order providing that: \n14  1.  Defendants have represented that the $4,039,516 funds awarded to Washington \n15  under its SSP grant may not be re-obligated to another entity or potential grantee, and those funds \n16  will remain available through September 30, 2029 to satisfy obligations, if any, to Washington \n17  under its grant. Given this representation, Washington has agreed not to seek a preliminary \n18  injunction, though it reserves its right to seek emergency relief, should the status of the FY 2024 \n19  SSP funds change.  \n20  2.  The following briefing and hearing schedule shall govern resolution of this case: \n21   \n22  Deadline  Event \n23  September 19, 2025  Plaintiff files Amended Complaint1 \n24  November 18, 2025  Defendants file Administrative Record \n25 \n \n1 On or before September 19, 2025, Washington will file a motion for leave to file an \n26 \namended complaint, which Defendants have indicated that they will not oppose. Defendants \n \n \nJOINT STIPULATION AND PROPOSED  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nCASE PLAN \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNo. 2:25-cv-01401-BJR  Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 11     Filed 09/16/25     Page 3 of 5\n \n1 \nDecember 18, 2025  Plaintiff files Motion for Summary Judgment (not to exceed 30 \npages) \n2 \nFebruary 5, 2026  Defendants file Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and \n3 \nOpposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment (not \nto exceed 30 pages) \n4 \nMarch 5, 2026  Plaintiff files Opposition to Defendants’ Cross-Motion for \n5 \nSummary Judgment and Reply in Support of Motion for \nSummary Judgment (not to exceed 20 pages) \n6 \n7  March 19, 2026  Defendants file Reply in Support of Cross-Motion for \nSummary Judgment (not to exceed 20 pages)  \n8 \nAt the Court’s discretion  Oral argument \n9 \n3.  This briefing schedule assumes there are no disputes about the completeness of the \n10 \nAdministrative Record that Defendants will produce on or before November 18, 2025. Washington \n11 \nreserves its right to move to complete or supplement the Administrative Record, if there are grounds \n12 \nfor doing so. If Washington believes the Administrative Record is deficient or incomplete, it will \n13 \npromptly meet and confer with Defendants to determine whether any adjustments to the summary \n14 \njudgment briefing schedule will be necessary. \n15 \n4.  Washington anticipates submitting one or more declarations in support of its Motion \n16 \nfor Summary Judgment to support its standing to bring this case. Following their review of those \n17 \ndeclarations,  Defendants  may  conduct  limited  discovery  related to  any affirmative  evidence \n18 \nWashington submits in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment that is not contained in the \n19 \nAdministrative Record. Likewise, Washington may conduct limited discovery related to any \n20 \nadditional evidence Defendants submit in support their Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and \n21 \nOpposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment that is not contained in the Administrative \n22 \nRecord or has not otherwise been submitted by Washington in support of its Motion for Summary \n23 \nJudgment. This briefing schedule contemplates that discovery, if any, will be limited in scope and \n24 \n \n25 \nreserve the right to seek revisions to this Stipulation and the Proposed Order pending their review \nof  the  amended  complaint;  Defendants  will  promptly  meet  and  confer  with  Washington \n26 \nregarding any such potential revisions before seeking this Court’s intervention. \n \n \nJOINT STIPULATION AND PROPOSED  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nCASE PLAN \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNo. 2:25-cv-01401-BJR  Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 11     Filed 09/16/25     Page 4 of 5\n \n1  will not enlarge the established briefing deadlines. \n2  5.  In  light  of  the  foregoing,  the  parties  are  relieved  of  all  other  pending  case \n3  management and pre-trial obligations, including: exchanging initial disclosures; filing a Combined \n4  Joint Status Report and Discovery Plan under Rule 26(f); and Defendants’ obligation to respond to \n5  the Complaint or forthcoming Amended Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12. \n6  DATED this 16th day of September 2025.  \n7   \nNICHOLAS W.

INTRODUCTION \n2 1.  The State of Washington brings this complaint for declaratory and injunctive \n3 relief in response to the Trump Administration’s unlawful wholesale termination of the Shelter \n4 and Services Program, a grant program established by Congress for the specific purpose of \n5 enabling non-Federal entities—like the State of Washington and its cities, counties, and non-\n6 profit partners—to provide shelter and essential services to the noncitizen migrants who settled \n7 in Washington after being processed and released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n8 (DHS). \n9 2.  Washington  recognizes  the  value  of  its  immigrant  residents  and  strives  to \n10 “remain[] a place where the rights and dignity of all residents are maintained and protected,” \n11 regardless of immigration status. See Wash. Rev. Code § 43.17.425; Laws of 2019 ch. 440, E2SB \n12 5497. These values were confirmed in practice between 2022 and 2024 when, cumulatively and \n13 consistent with national trends, more than 45,000 noncitizen migrants settled in Washington after \n14 they were processed and released by DHS.  \n15 3.  For many of these newcomers, their arrival in Washington was the culmination \n16 of a long and traumatic journey that began when they were forced to flee persecution in their \n17 home countries and seek asylum in the United States. They arrived in Washington with few \n18 resources to their name, let alone stable shelter, and without access to federal support or even \n19 permission to earn a living. Unfortunately, Washington’s housing and homeless crisis response \n20 system was already over capacity at this time and stretched too thin to provide the kind of initial \n21 support that would not only meet the immediate needs of these newcomers but also allow them \n22 to find their bearings in their new home. Indeed, most of Washington’s emergency shelters were \n23 already being filled each night. Lacking better options, these noncitizen migrants sought shelter \n24 wherever they could find it, sometimes in informal encampments in King County, which may \n25 have provided a measure of stability but were an unsustainable option, particularly with winter \n26 fast approaching. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 4 of 39\n \n1 4.  More  resources  and  better  coordination  among  service  providers  were \n2 desperately  needed.  Washington  responded,  launching  the  Washington  Migrant  and \n3 Asylum-Seeker Support Project in October 2024 to connect these newcomers with support and \n4 services and backing that program with more than $25 million in state funding. Washington was \n5 joined in its humanitarian commitment by local governments, including King County and the \n6 City of Tukwila, and community organizations, like the Seattle-based shelter, Mary’s Place, \n7 which provided shelter space, educational and health programs, and other services to help ensure \n8 the basic needs of these new Washingtonians were met. \n9 5.  Congress also recognized that the cost of providing initial support to these \n10 newcomers was straining the budgets of non-Federal entities, including states like Washington. \n11 And it further acknowledged that expanding the shelter capacity of non-Federal entities was \n12 necessary and a far better option than needlessly detaining these newcomers—many of whom \n13 were seeking humanitarian protections—in overcrowded DHS detention facilities. In 2023, \n14 Congress responded to these concerns by creating the Shelter and Services Program (SSP) and \n15 appropriating federal funds “to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal \n16 entities, . . . in  support  of  relieving  overcrowding  in  short-term  holding  facilities  of  U.S. \n17 Customs  and  Border  Protection[.]”  See  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act,  2023,  Pub.  L. \n18 No. 117-328, 136 STAT. 4730 (Dec. 29, 2022).  \n19 6.  Congress reauthorized the grant program in 2024, once again appropriating \n20 federal funds to help non-Federal partners, like state governments, provide shelter to those who \n21 had been processed and released by DHS—a population Congress understood necessarily \n22 included many people who entered into the United States without inspection. See Pub. L. \n23 No. 118-47, 138 STAT. 597, 598 (March 23, 2024). \n24 7.  In recognition of the promising but costly steps Washington and its local partners \n25 had taken to provide shelter to noncitizen migrants, as well as the continuing need for additional \n26 resources,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA)  awarded  Washington \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 5 of 39\n \n1 $4,039,516 in SSP funds to reimburse Washington and its local partners for the costs they had \n2 already incurred and to increase their capacity to provide more of the same.  \n3 8.  To date, Washington and its partners have neither requested nor received a single \n4 dollar from that award. \n5 9.  Almost as soon as President Trump was sworn into office for his second term, he \n6 began an all-out assault on grant programs that were distributing federal funds to recipients and \n7 causes  he  dislikes.  In  particular,  he  directed  DHS  “to  ensure  that  so-called  ‘sanctuary’ \n8 jurisdictions . . . do  not  receive  access  to  Federal  funds”  and  to  “[t]erminate”  any  grants \n9 “providing Federal funding to non-governmental organizations supporting or providing services, \n10 either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens[.]” Protecting the American People \n11 Against Invasion, Exec. Order 14159 §§ 17, 19, 90 Fed. Reg. 8443, 8446-47 (Jan. 29, 2025).  \n12 10.  Defendants took prompt action to carry out these directives against the Shelter \n13 and Services Program. \n14 11.  First, on January 28, 2025, Secretary Kristi Noem directed DHS components to \n15 place “on hold pending review” grant programs that “touch in any way on immigration,” \n16 ostensibly out of a “concern[]” that these programs were funding “illegal activities,” like \n17 “inducing” or “harboring . . . illegal aliens.” See Secretary Noem, Memorandum for Component \n18 and Office Heads (Jan. 28, 2025). No “review” was necessary for the Shelter and Services \n19 Program, however, Secretary Noem summarily ordered a hold on all funds administered under \n20 that program. \n21 12.  Second, on February 10, 2025, Defendants quietly de-obligated approximately \n22 $885.2 million previously obligated for SSP awards in an effort to kneecap the whole program, \n23 including the entire $4,039,516 obligated for Washington’s SSP award. This behind-the-scenes \n24 accounting maneuver signified that, in Defendants’ view, they no longer had legal obligations \n25 under the Shelter and Services Program.  \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 6 of 39\n \n1 13.  Third, on or about March 11, 2025, Defendants sent sham “notices” to SSP grant \n2 recipients, including Washington, alleging noncompliance with the terms of the SSP grant and \n3 stating that the recipients’ funding would be withheld until further notice. Defendants made \n4 vague reference to their “significant concerns that SSP funding” was “going to entities engaged \n5 in or facilitating illegal activities,” but provided no evidence to support their concerns about the \n6 Shelter and Services Program, generally, or Washington’s use of SSP funds, specifically. \n7 Instead, recipients were given 30 days to comply with onerous information requests—including \n8 a demand to provide the “names and contact information” for every individual who received \n9 services under the award—or 60 days to lodge an appeal with FEMA. \n10 14.  Fourth, and before either of FEMA’s deadlines had expired, Defendants notified \n11 SSP grant recipients on April 1, 2025, that the Shelter and Services Program had been officially \n12 terminated. Defendants’ termination notice made no mention of the “significant concerns” hinted \n13 at in the noncompliance letter but, rather, explained that they were terminating the Shelter and \n14 Services  Program  because  the  funds  “provide[]  support  for  illegal  aliens,”  which  “is  not \n15 consistent with DHS’s current priorities.”  \n16 15.  When it authorized and appropriated funds to support the Shelter and Services \n17 Program, Congress could not have been clearer that these funds were intended “to support \n18 sheltering  and  related  activities  provided  by  non-Federal  entities,”  in  order  to  “reliev[e] \n19 overcrowding” in U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) short-term holding facilities. See \n20 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 STAT. 4730 (Dec. 29, 2022). \n21 Achieving that goal necessarily required providing support, in the form of emergency shelter \n22 and other essential services, for a population that was certain to include individuals who entered \n23 the United States without inspection, who Defendants derisively refer to as “illegal aliens.”  \n24 16.  Defendants have made clear their disdain for noncitizen migrants, especially \n25 those who entered without inspection and seek humanitarian protection in the United States. \n26 Likewise, Defendants have made clear their opposition to jurisdictions, like Washington, that \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 7 of 39\n \n1 protect the rights and dignity of all residents, regardless of immigration status, and leave the cost \n2 and responsibility of enforcing federal, civil immigration law to the federal government. And \n3 they have further made clear their view that neither should receive federal support of any kind. \n4 But Defendants’ policy preference, no matter how much of a priority it might be for them, cannot \n5 override the policy priorities that Congress has expressed through statute.  \n6 17.  Here, Congress’ decision to authorize and fund the Shelter and Services Program \n7 provides a clear expression of its policy judgment to, in Defendants’ verbiage, “provide[] support \n8 for illegal aliens” after their release by DHS.  \n9 18.  Defendants had no lawful basis to override Congress’ judgment or the plain \n10 purpose  of  its  funding  program  and  their  actions  to  pause,  withhold,  and  then  terminate \n11 Washington’s SSP grant violates the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine, the \n12 Spending Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and is additionally ultra vires.  \n13 19.  The Court must set aside Defendants’ unlawful actions and compel the restoration \n14 of the Shelter and Services Program so that, consistent with Congress’ wishes, non-Federal \n15 entities, like Washington, can continue supporting their new immigrant neighbors with shelter \n16 and essential services. \n17\nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18 20.  The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n19 1346(a)(2). The Court has further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, \n20 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202. Jurisdiction is also proper under the judicial review provisions \n21 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n22 21.  Venue  is  proper  in  the  Western  District  of  Washington  under  28  U.S.C. \n23 §§ 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). Defendants are United States officers, employees, and/or agencies sued \n24 in their official capacities. Plaintiff State of Washington is a resident of the Western District of \n25 Washington. Venue is appropriate in the Seattle Division because a substantial part of the events \n26 or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred and are continuing to occur within this \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  5  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 8 of 39\n \n1 judicial division, including in King County, where the shelter and other services Washington \n2 intended to support through its SSP grant were provided. \n3\nIII.  PARTIES \n4 22.  Plaintiff State of Washington, represented by and through its Attorney General, \n5 Nicholas W. Brown, is a sovereign state of the United States of America. The Attorney General \n6 is the chief legal adviser to the State. The Attorney General’s powers and duties include acting \n7 in  federal  court  on  behalf  of  the  State  on  matters  of  public  concern.  Wash.  Rev.  Code \n8 § 43.10.030(1); Wash. Const. art. III § 21. \n9 23.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a federal agency \n10 headquartered in Washington, D.C. DHS administers the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), \n11 including the grant awarded to Washington under that program.  \n12 24.  Defendant Kristi Noem is the Secretary of DHS and serves as that agency’s \n13 highest ranking official. She is charged with the supervision and management of all decisions \n14 and actions of that agency, including decisions and actions concerning the Shelter and Services \n15 Program. She is sued in her official capacity.  \n16 25.  Defendant Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a federal agency \n17 within DHS that coordinates operational and logistical disaster response and administers many \n18 of DHS’s federal grant programs, including the Shelter and Services Program. \n19 26.  Defendant David Richardson is the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the \n20 Administrator of FEMA and serves as FEMA’s highest ranking official. He is sued in his official \n21 capacity. \n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 9 of 39\n \n1 IV.  ALLEGATIONS \n2 A.  Congress Created the Shelter and Services Program to Reimburse Non-Federal \nPartners, Like Washington, for Providing Shelter to Noncitizen Migrants Released \n3 From DHS’s Custody  \n \n4 1.  Faced with significant need, Washington and local partners provided shelter \nand essential resources to newly arrived noncitizen migrants \n5\n27.  “Immigrants make a significant contribution to” the State of Washington and the \n6\nState has, accordingly, enacted “policies that recognize” the importance of noncitizens to its \n7\neconomy and ensure that the state “remains a place where the rights and dignity of all residents,” \n8\nregardless  of  their  immigration  status,  “are  maintained  and  protected.”  Wash.  Rev.  Code \n9\n§ 43.17.425; Laws of 2019, ch. 440, § 1. It was with these values firmly in mind that, beginning \n10\nin  2022,  Washington  welcomed  tens  of  thousands  of  noncitizen  migrants  who  settled  in \n11\nWashington after they were released from DHS custody near the southwest border. \n12\n28.  The swell of noncitizen migrants settling in Washington was connected to broader \n13\nmigration trends that resulted in millions of individuals entering the United States through the \n14\nsouthwest border between 2019 and 2024,1 many of whom sought humanitarian protection, \n15\nincluding asylum. Detaining everyone it encountered during this period would have stretched \n \n16\nDHS resources well past the breaking point, threatening national security, and creating inhumane \n17\nand dangerous conditions of confinement in the process.2  \n18\n29.  Accordingly, those individuals not subject to expedited removal were either \n19\ntransferred to another agency or released into the United States with instructions to appear at \n20\n \n21 1 See generally U.S. Customs and Border Prot., Southwest Land Border Encounters (last \nvisited  September  19,  2025),  https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-\n22 encounters (detailing southwest land border encounters between 2022 and 2025 and collecting \nprevious year statistics showing the same for Fiscal Years 2017 to 2022). \n23\n2 See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Off. of the Inspector Gen., OIG-23-45, CBP Could \nDo  More  to  Plan  for  Facilities  Along  the  Southwest  Border  at  14  (Aug.  29,  2023), \n24\nhttps://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-09/OIG-23-45-Aug23.pdf  (noting  that \nBorder Patrol has, at various points, exercised prosecutorial discretion authority to “release \n25\nnoncitizens without placing them in removal proceedings” when doing so is necessary “to \nmitigate operational challenges, including risks to national security”); U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \n26\nSec., Off. of the Inspector Gen., OIG-19-46, Management Alert - DHS Needs to Address \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 10 of 39\n \n1 future immigration proceedings.3 Between 2019 and 2024, nearly 3 million individuals were \n2 released by U.S. Border Patrol with notices to appear or report, on their own recognizance, as an \n3 exercise of prosecutorial discretion, or as part of an alternative to detention or parole with \n4 conditions programs.4 \n5 30.  Once released from DHS custody, “[t]he majority of migrants disperse from the \n6 border and travel by bus or plane to other areas typically away from their entry point.”5 \n7 Cumulatively, more than 45,000 settled in Washington between 2022 and 2024. \n8 31.   Upon  arrival,  these  newcomers  faced  numerous  barriers  to  securing  stable \n9 shelter. The long and expensive journey to Washington left many without much money. Some \n10 were also burdened by the trauma of the hardships that forced them to flee from their countries \n11 of  birth.  And,  given  their  immigration  status,  most  lacked  access  to  federal  support  or \n12 employment authorization. \n13\n14\n \nDangerous  Overcrowding  Among  Single  Adults  at  El  Paso  Del  Norte  Processing  Center \n15\n(May 30, 2019), https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mga/2019/oig-19-46-may19-\nmgmtalert.pdf (alerting DHS to “dangerous overcrowding” and reports that “detainees had been \n16\nheld in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks”). \n17 3 CBP Could Do More to Plan for Facilities Along the Southwest Border, supra note 2 \nat 1. \n18\n4 U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Off. of Homeland Sec.

Unfortunately, Washington’s housing and homeless crisis response system was \n2 already over capacity at this time and stretched too thin to provide the kind of initial support that \n3 would not only meet the immediate needs of these newcomers but also allow them to find their \n4 bearings in their new home. Indeed, most of Washington’s emergency shelters were already \n5 filled each night. Unsurprisingly, of the estimated 21,457 noncitizen migrants who arrived in \n6 Washington in 2023, approximately 3,841, or 18 percent, reported experiencing homelessness.  \n7 33.  The unsustainable strain of this additional need was abundantly clear to local \n8 shelters, like Seattle-based Mary’s Place, which saw the amount of shelter space it allocated to \n9 noncitizen migrants jump from 25 percent in 2023 to 48 percent in 2024. \n10 34.  Statewide, Washington estimates that approximately 1,200 to 1,500 noncitizen \n11 migrants were reliant on unstable housing options in 2024, including hotels, family shelters, or \n12 tent encampments, which had formed in several locations during this period, particularly in King \n13 County.6  \n14 35.  The largest tent encampment formed in early 2023 on the property of the Riverton \n15 Park United Methodist Church (RPUMC) in the City of Tukwila. At its peak, upwards of 300 \n16 noncitizen migrants, mainly from Venezuela, Angola, and Congo, were living in “50 to 60 tents” \n17 that had been “crammed into the church’s front lawn, around side buildings and on the pavement \n18 of what used to be a parking lot.”7 The RPUMC encampment residents included families with \n19 children, as well as pregnant and post-partum people.  \n20  \n6  See,  e.g.,  Anna  Patrick,  Asylum-seekers  removed  from  Kent  encampment;  many \n21 questions  remain,  Seattle  Times  (Sept.  28,  2024),  https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-\nnews/homeless/asylum-seekers-removed-from-kent-encampment-many-questions-remain/; \n22 Gene Johnson, Hundreds of asylum-seekers are camped out near Seattle.

For a group that included those who arrived in Washington after “surviving war, \n2 rape and other atrocities,” encampments provided a measure of relative safety and stability.8 But \n3 they also lacked adequate protection from the elements or appropriate sanitation infrastructure, \n4 which presented numerous public health and safety issues.9  \n5 37.  The City of Tukwila eventually proclaimed a state of emergency at the RPUMC \n6 encampment, finding that the site “constitutes a humanitarian crisis where the need for resources \n7 for safe sanitary shelter is acute and beyond the capabilities of Tukwila itself to manage.”10 \n8 38.  Washington recognized that, without additional resources and better coordination \n9 among service providers, the needs of its new noncitizen migrant residents would continue to go \n10 unmet. True to its values, Washington responded, launching the Washington Migrant and \n11 Asylum-Seeker Support Project (the “WA MASS Project”) in October 2024, which increased \n12 the state’s capacity to help the recently arrived noncitizen migrants meet their most basic needs: \n13 suitable shelter; access to food, water, and acute medical care; and basic hygiene supplies, like \n14 clean diapers.  \n15 39.  Specifically, the WA MASS Project vested the Washington Department of Social \n16 & Health Services (DSHS) Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance (ORIA) with new legal \n17 authority  to  “administer  services  to  immigrants  who  are  ineligible  for  federal  [refugee \n18 resettlement]  services”  and  to  “contract  with . . . community-based  organizations”  for  that \n19 purpose.

Through the WA MASS Project, Washington sought to build a statewide network \n7 of organizations that could deliver a coordinated response to meet the specific and immediate \n8 needs of the recently arrived noncitizen migrants. The funds available through the WA MASS \n9 Project were competitively awarded to organizations that could provide services in six core \n10 service  areas:  (1) reception  and  navigation  services,  (2) emergency  shelter,  (3) housing \n11 navigation  and  rental  assistance,  (4) culturally  responsive  case  management  services, \n12 (5) immigration-related legal services, and (6) education, employment, and training services.  \n13 41.  Although the support provided through the WA MASS Project was an important \n14 expression of Washington’s values, as well as an important infusion of material support, \n15 Washington recognized that more was needed to ensure that the essential needs of its noncitizen \n16 migrant residents were met, particularly given the time-limited nature of the WA MASS pilot \n17 program. Accordingly, Washington looked to expand the reach of the WA MASS Project by \n18 adding federal Shelter and Services Program funds into its resource mix.  \n19\n2.  Congress  created  the  Shelter  and  Services  Program  to  ensure  states, \nlocalities, and community organizations could meet the needs of noncitizen \n20\nmigrants, after their release from DHS custody \n21\n42.  Recognizing the need for additional resources to help local communities meet the \n22\nneeds of noncitizen migrants, in 2019, Congress began appropriating funds to FEMA for \n23\ndisbursement “to jurisdictions or local recipient organizations serving communities that have \n24  \n11 Press Release, Wash.

President Trump signed the first iteration of this funding into law on July 1, 2019, \n6 appropriating $30,000,000 “for the emergency food and shelter program,” which “provid[ed] \n7 assistance to aliens released from the custody of the Department of Homeland Security” through \n8 grants administered by FEMA under the Emergency Food and Shelter Program - Humanitarian \n9 (EFSP-H). See id. Congress continued to support the EFSP-H grant program with further \n10 appropriations in 2021 and 2022. See American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub. L. No. 117-2, \n11 135 Stat. 79 (March 11, 2021) ($110,000,000); Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. \n12 No. 117-103, 136 Stat. 345 (March 15, 2022) ($150,000,000).  \n13 44.  In 2023, Congress established the Shelter and Services Program by appropriating \n14 $800,000,000 “to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal entities . . . in \n15 support  of  relieving  overcrowding  in  short-term  [CBP]  holding  facilities.”  Consolidated \n16 Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 STAT. 4730 (Dec. 29, 2022). In an \n17 accompanying Joint Explanatory Statement, Congress clarified that “the $800 million [wa]s \n18 appropriated for” the creation of the SSP but, “‘[i]n order to avoid any interruption in support \n19 for CBP short-term holding facility decompression,’ up to $785 million” was available for award \n20 under the existing EFSP-H grant program.12 SSP, which awards funds directly to recipients, was \n21 meant to replace the EFSP-H, which distributed funds to recipients through a national board.13 \n22 45.

L. No. 118-47, 138 \n3 STAT. 597, 598 (March 23, 2024). \n4 46.  On April 12, 2024, FEMA announced that it was accepting applications for \n5 $340,900,000 in competitive SSP grant funds, which it would award by September 30, 2024. \n6 See FY 2024 SSP-C Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), attached as Exhibit 1. FEMA \n7 expressly stated that these funds were being made available, “[a]s directed by Congress, . . . to \n8 enable non-federal entities to off-set allowable costs incurred for services associated with \n9 noncitizen migrants recently encountered and released by DHS,” in order to achieve “the primary \n10 purpose of SSP”: “‘relieving overcrowding in short-term holding facilities of [CBP].’” Id. at 5 \n11 (emphasis added) (quoting Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 STAT. at 598). \n12 47.  Although the grants were awarded on September 30, 2024, their performance \n13 period was October 1, 2023 – September 30, 2026, which meant that grant recipients could seek \n14 reimbursement for any allowable expenses incurred during that period. See id at 7. \n15 48.  As specified in the NOFO, state and local governments, Native American tribes, \n16 and certain non-profit organizations were eligible to apply and would be evaluated based on their \n17 ability to meet “Performance Measures,” such as the number of meals and nights of lodging they \n18 had provided or expected to provide, and the number of “noncitizen migrants served through \n19 translation services.” See id. at 6-7.  \n20 49.  In keeping with the purpose of SSP, only services provided to “noncitizen \n21 migrants released from a DHS facility” were reimbursable under SSP grants. See NOFO at 47. \n22 In addition, only costs related to the “allowable activities” designated by FEMA in an appendix \n23 to the NOFO were subject to reimbursement. See id. at 47-51. \n24 50.  In order to be reimbursed for an allowable expense under an SSP award, grant \n25 recipients were required to submit documentation, including the names, Alien Registration \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  13  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 16 of 39\n \n1 Numbers, and evidence of DHS processing, for the individuals being served, as well as proof of \n2 payment for the allowable services provided. See id. at 52-53. \n3\n3.  FEMA awards Washington more than $4 million in SSP funds to continue \nproviding shelter and services to noncitizen migrants in Washington  \n4\n51.  Washington submitted its application for a competitive Shelter and Services \n5\nGrant on June 21, 2024. See Washington SSP Application, attached as Exhibit 2. \n6\n52.  In  its  application,  Washington  proposed  disbursing  SSP  funds  to  three \n7\nsubrecipient partners, which it identified as well-suited to help advance the complementary goals \n8\nof the WA MASS Project and SSP: the City of Tukwila, Public Health - Seattle & King County \n9\n(Public Health), and the non-profit organization, Mary’s Place Seattle. Washington planned to \n10\nidentify additional subrecipient partner organizations at a later date that would also be able to \n11\nprovide shelter and other essential services to noncitizen migrants.  \n12\n53.  Washington’s  proposed  subrecipients  each  had  established  track  records  of \n13\nsuccessfully  providing  shelter  and  other  services  to  noncitizen  migrants  and  Washington \n14\nanticipated that, collectively and with support from SSP funds, they would be able to provide \n15\nshelter and other services to approximately 525 noncitizen migrants each day.  \n16\n54.  In support of its application, Washington described the services its intended \n17\nsubrecipients had already provided to noncitizen migrants, which would have been reimbursable \n18\nand/or extended through Washington’s SSP grant. \n19\n55.  For instance, in October 2023, the City of Tukwila paid for the construction and \n20\noperation of a large, heated tent structure at the RPUMC encampment, and also hired a \n21\nconsulting firm with experience doing outreach and providing services to unhoused populations. \n22\nSee id. at 4-21. Washington estimated that the City of Tukwila’s efforts at RPUMC and other \n23\nlocations throughout the city were “support[ing] 200 to 250 people per night.” Id. at 2. \n24\n56.  Washington also sought SSP funds to support Public Health’s work providing \n25\nculturally relevant health information and acute medical care for noncitizen migrants residing in \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  14  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 17 of 39\n \n1 various encampments and hotels in Seattle and King County, including at RPUMC. In particular, \n2 Public Health hired community navigators—health workers with relevant cultural and language \n3 competencies—that provided in-language guidance and support to noncitizen migrants on \n4 critical topics for those living in a congregate shelter with limited facilities. Through the \n5 community navigators, Public Health was able to provide information on best practices for \n6 hygiene and sanitation, rodent prevention, food safety, severe weather safety, vaccination, and \n7 health care system navigation, including health care enrollment and linkage to care.  \n8 57.  Beyond its work to share information with noncitizen migrants, Public Health \n9 also provided goods and services. For instance, it provided direct healthcare through its Mobile \n10 Medical van, arranged transportation for pregnant people with health emergencies, such as \n11 preeclampsia, and handed out essential items, like hygiene kits, baby formula and diapers, and \n12 baby and maternity clothing. \n13 58.  Washington also planned to use SSP funds to support the work of Mary’s Place, \n14 a Seattle-based non-profit with a long history of providing emergency shelter for unhoused \n15 families, including pregnant people, families with infants or medically fragile children, and \n16 families fleeing domestic violence. Washington estimated that Mary’s Place was able to serve \n17 approximately 150 noncitizen migrants per day with a 24/7 shelter operation that included, in \n18 addition to bed space, a centralized food service, connections to housing specialists, healthcare, \n19 youth programming, legal clinics, job fairs, and resume workshops.  \n20 59.  In addition to the City of Tukwila, Public Health, and Mary’s Place, Washington \n21 planned to identify through the WA MASS Project’s competitive application process one or \n22 more additional partner organizations that were expected to provide shelter and services to an \n23 additional 425 noncitizen migrants each day. \n24 60.  As  part  of  its  application,  Washington  certified  that  it  and  its  intended \n25 subrecipients either had or would develop the “internal controls and processes” necessary “to \n26 clearly identify migrants who will be receiving services to be funded by SSP dollars and to ensure \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  15  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 18 of 39\n \n1 said migrants were processed and released from DHS apart from other populations served.” \n2 See Washington SSP Application Worksheet (Tab 5), attached as Exhibit 3. Washington further \n3 certified that, when seeking reimbursement for services rendered, it would submit “verified \n4 status  and  release  dates . . . by  Alien  Registration  Number . . . or  evidence  of  DHS \n5 processing . . . for any A-numbers being submitted with this application.” Id. \n6 61.  On  September  26,  2024,  FEMA  notified  Washington  that  its  SSP  grant \n7 application had been approved and that it had been awarded $4,039,516. See SSP Award Package \n8 at 1, attached as Exhibit 4. \n9 62.  Included  with  FEMA’s  Award  Package  was  an  Award  Summary,  which \n10 described the purpose of the Shelter and Services Program: \n \n11\nThe  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2024  Shelter  and  Services  Program  (SSP)  provides \nnon-federal entities that serve noncitizen migrants recently released from DHS \n12\ncustody to temporarily provide shelter, food, transportation, acute medical care, \n13 personal hygiene supplies, and labor necessary to manage cases to provide these \nservices, and to provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to \n14\ntemporarily  shelter  noncitizen  migrants  recently  released  from  DHS  custody, \nincluding renovations and modifications to existing facilities. \n15\n16 Id. at 2 (emphases added). \n17 63.  In connection with the award, FEMA also provided an approved scope of \n18 work for Washington’s SSP grant, which included the following budgeted amounts:  \n19 a.   $25,237.66 for DSHS, through a subrecipient partner, to rent hotel/motel \n20 rooms as emergency shelter for an estimated 500-600 noncitizen migrants; \n21 b.  $284,035.32 for the City of Tukwila’s six-month rental of a large tent at \n22 RPUMC, which provided shelter to 75 noncitizen migrants; \n23 c.  $182,500 for the City of Tukwila’s operation of a food pantry at the \n24 RPUMC;  \n25 d.  $180,000 for the City of Tukwila serving 12,000 meals to noncitizen \n26 migrant residents at RPUMC and hotels in Tukwila; \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  16  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 19 of 39\n \n1 e.  $688,098.92 for the City of Tukwila retaining the services of Innovative \n2 Impact  Strategies,  LLC  (i2),  which  was  engaged  to  help  manage  the \n3 temporary shelter and services being provided to the 250-300 noncitizen \n4 migrants residing at RPUMC; \n5 f.  $22,947.99 to the City of Tukwila for garbage and refuse collection, site \n6 cleanup and disposal of debris; \n7 g.  $10,000 to the City of Tukwila for translation and interpretation services to \n8 help with community and external communications at RPUMC; \n9 h.  $117,000 for Public Health to purchase a one-year supply of diapers for 150 \n10 infants; \n11 i.  $25,500 for Public Health to provide emergency medical transportation for \n12 pregnant people needing stabilization due to preeclampsia, for three years; \n13 j.  $11,250 for Public Health to purchase maternity clothes for 150 pregnant \n14 people; \n15 k.  $4,500 for Public Health to purchase baby clothing for 150 babies; \n16 l.  $30,000 for Public Health to purchase a one-year supply of baby formula \n17 for 20 babies; \n18 m. $161,032.20 for Public Health mobile teams to conduct health screenings \n19 for noncitizen migrants residing in emergency shelters and hotels in King \n20 County; \n21 n.  $175,000 for Public Health to purchase 5,000 hygiene kits containing soap, \n22 shampoo, combs, brushes, deodorant, baby wipes, body wipes, and storage \n23 bags; \n24 o.  $10,000 for Public Health to purchase and distribute hygiene and sanitation \n25 outreach materials; \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  17  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 20 of 39\n \n1 p.  $250,000 for Public Health to hire a full-time equivalent midwife for three \n2 years to provide health screenings for pregnant people. \n3 q.  $246,375.00 for Mary’s Place to provide meals to 150 people per day for \n4 one year; and \n5 r.  $684,375.00 for Mary’s Place to provide shelter beds to 150 noncitizen \n6 migrants per day for one year. \n7 64.  In total, FEMA’s approved scope of work contemplated that Washington would \n8 allocate its $4,039,516 award to subrecipients in the following amounts: $1,507,088.34 for the \n9 City of Tukwila; $1,218,595.18 for Public Health; and $1,080,741 for Mary’s Place. The \n10 remaining $233,091.48 was reserved for additional lodging costs and DSHS’ administrative \n11 expenses. \n12 65.  Although the entire award amount was obligated to Washington, FEMA placed \n13 payment holds on $1,480,000, pending its review of more detailed cost breakdowns and \n14 justifications. Washington anticipated being able to provide that information and, over the \n15 course of the performance period, utilizing the full award amount. \n16 66.  These funds would have been used to reimburse allowable expenses for services \n17 that had already been provided, as well as to support the continued provision of services by \n18 Washington’s intended subrecipients.   \n19 67.  Washington  entered  into  a  client  service  contract  with  Mary’s  Place  on \n20 February 20, 2025, pursuant to which the state is obligated to reimburse Mary’s Place for the \n21 full amount it planned to allocate from the SSP award.

The Trump Administration Illegally Cut Funding Appropriated by Congress for \nthe Shelter and Services Program \n2  \n1.  President  Trump  directed  DHS  to  eliminate  federal  funding  from \n3 “Sanctuary Jurisdictions” \n4 68.  As soon as he took office, President Trump issued an executive order entitled \n5 “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” (the “Invasion EO”). Exec. Order 14159, \n6 90 Fed. Reg. 8443 (Jan. 29, 2025). The Invasion EO asserted that the United States had \n7 experienced an “unprecedented flood of illegal immigration” and that this influx “has cost \n8 taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.” Id. at 8443.  \n9 69.  The Invasion EO also called for a “Funding Review” and directed the Secretary \n10 of DHS, among other agency officials, to review “all contracts, grants or other agreements \n11 providing federal funding to non-governmental organizations” that support or provide services, \n12 “directly or indirectly,” to “removable or illegal aliens” and to “[p]ause distribution of all further \n13 funds pursuant to such agreements pending the results of” this review. Id. at 8447.  \n14 70.  The Invasion EO further directed the DHS Secretary to ensure that “so-called \n15 ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions” did not receive federal funds. Id. at 8446. \n16 71.  DHS considers Washington to be a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”14  \n17 72.  On January 28, 2025, Secretary Noem issued a memorandum directing DHS \n18 “Component and Office Heads” to place “on hold pending review” all DHS “grant disbursements \n19 and assessments of grant applications that: (a) go to non-profit organizations or for which \n20 non-profit organizations are eligible, and (b) touch in any way on immigration.” Secretary Noem, \n21 Memorandum for Component and Office Heads (Jan. 28, 2025) (the “January 28 Noem Memo”), \n22 attached as Exhibit 5.

The Secretary’s reason for this sweeping decision “include[d]” her unsupported \n4 “concerns” that the grants: (1) “may be funding illegal activities, such as encouraging or inducing \n5 illegal immigration, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv), or illegal harboring of illegal aliens, 8 U.S.C. \n6 §§ 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii)-(iii)”; (2) may include “racially discriminatory language”; and (3) “may not \n7 be an efficient use of government resources.” Id. \n8 74.  Despite having tasked DHS component and office heads with identifying covered \n9 grant programs, Secretary Noem summarily asserted that the “hold . . . appl[ies] to the Shelter \n10 and Services Program[.]” Id.; see also Decl. of Cameron Hamilton at ¶ 9, City of New York v. \n11 Trump, 25-cv-1510 (S.D.N.Y.), ECF No. 17-1 (testifying that, based on the January 28 Noem \n12 Memo, “FEMA did not have the authorization to make [a] payment” to New York City under an \n13 open SSP award). \n14 75.  On February 14, 2025, Mr. Hamilton, the Senior Official Performing the Duties \n15 of the Administrator at FEMA, issued Grant Processing Guidance, which implemented Secretary \n16 Noem’s instruction by placing “[g]rants under the Shelter and Services Program . . . on hold, \n17 pending a compliance review,” and prohibited FEMA from making any “new obligation, \n18 disbursement or payment of funds previously obligated.” See FEMA, Grant Processing Guidance \n19 (Feb. 14, 2025), attached as Exhibit 6. The FEMA Grant Processing Guidance thus put yet \n20 another bureaucratic layer between the funds and SSP grant recipients, thereby ensuring they \n21 remained unavailable. Id. \n22 76.  But Defendants did more than merely place the Shelter and Service Program “on \n23 hold”; they eliminated it entirely. Indeed, the transaction history for the Shelter and Services \n24 Program on USASpending.gov shows that, on February 10, 2025, FEMA de-obligated more than \n25\n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  20  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 23 of 39\n \n1 $885 million in funds previously awarded as SSP grants,15 including Washington’s full award \n2 amount of $4,039,516.16  \n3  \n4  \n5  \n6\n7  \n8  \n9  \n10  \n11\n12 77.  On information and belief, FEMA de-obligated unspent funds for the entire \n13 Shelter and Services Program. \n14 78.  Practically, FEMA’s de-obligation17 of all Shelter and Services Program funds \n15 rendered grant recipients, like Washington, unable to seek reimbursement for allowable expenses \n16 incurred under the grant. This behind-the-scenes accounting maneuver carried legal significance, \n17 as  well.  As  Defendants  have  elsewhere  explained,  “[t]hat  SSP  funds  were  de-obligated \n18 reflect[ed] the accounting reality that the government terminated plaintiffs’ grant awards.”18 \n19 79.  FEMA did not notify Washington of this action, either before or after it occurred. \n20\n \n21 15 See USASpending.gov, Advanced Search (last visited September 16, 2025), \nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=f8657adf538ed7ee783fa1f3978e7586 \n22 16 See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., EMW-2024-SP-05140 (last visited on July 25, \n2025), https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_EMW-2024-SP-05140_7022. \n23\n17 De-obligation is “[a]n agency’s cancellation or downward adjustment of previously \nincurred obligations.” U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, A Glossary of Terms Used in the \n24\nFederal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP at 44 (Sept. 2005), https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-\n05-734sp.pdf.  \n25\n18 See Defs.’ PI Opp. Mem. at 8, City of Chicago v.

Next, having “paused” access to SSP funds based on their availability to non-\n2 profit organizations and connection to immigration, see January 28 Noem Memo, Secretary \n3 Noem directed all DHS components, including FEMA, “to review all federal financial assistance \n4 awards  to  determine  if  Department  funds,  directly  or  indirectly,  are  going  to  sanctuary \n5 jurisdictions” and to “cease providing federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions” identified in \n6 that process.” See Memorandum for All Agencies and Offices, Restricting Grant Funding for \n7 Sanctuary Jurisdictions (Feb. 19, 2025) (the “February 19 Noem Memo”), attached as Exhibit 7. \n8 81.  FEMA carried out the directives imposed by the January 28 Noem Memo and the \n9 February 19 Noem Memo by: (1) identifying grant programs that, in FEMA’s view, do not “align \n10 with Administration and Secretary priorities on non-governmental organizations, immigration, \n11 and sanctuary jurisdictions”; and (2) recommending that DHS place “conditions or restrictions” \n12 on all Shelter and Services Program awards, see Approval of FEMA-Administered Grant \n13 Disbursements at 1-2, attached as Exhibit 8, and further (3) review all SSP awards “for \n14 [t]ermination,” see id., Table A.  \n15 82.  Secretary Noem approved FEMA’s recommendations on March 25, 2025. See \n16 generally  id.  at  3-4  (reflecting  Secretary  Noem’s  signature  and  approval  of  FEMA’s \n17 recommendations). \n \n18\n2.  Defendants imposed “special conditions” on grants made under the Shelter \nand Services Program before announcing the Program’s termination \n19\n83.  On March 11, 2025, FEMA notified Washington that, in light of its “significant \n20\nconcerns that SSP funding is going to entities engaged in facilitating illegal activities,” it was \n21\n“temporarily withholding payments” under the SSP grant “pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.339(a)” \n22\nand  “instituting  specific  conditions . . . pursuant  to  2  C.F.R.  § 200.208.”  See  Letter  from \n23\nCameron Hamilton at 1 (March 11, 2025) (the “March 11 Letter”), attached as Exhibit 9.  \n24\n84.  As “special conditions,” FEMA announced that it would conduct “additional \n25\nmonitoring and review of [Washington’s] award(s)”; require Washington to provide FEMA with \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  22  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 25 of 39\n \n1\ndocuments and information regarding the individuals to whom services had been provided under \n2\nthe SSP award within 30 days, including “names and contact information” for those individuals; \n3\nand  submit  affidavits  “attesting”  that  neither  Washington  nor  its  subrecipients  have  any \n4\n“knowledge or suspicion that” the SSP funds had been used in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324. See \n5\nid. at 1-2.  \n6\n85.  FEMA further directed Washington not “to incur any additional costs under the \n7\ngrant,” until further notice. Id. at 2. \n8\n86.  FEMA did not identify specific incidents or evidence that gave rise to the \n9\n“significant concerns” that supposedly justified the imposition of these conditions. Nor did it \n10\nacknowledge that it had already zeroed out Washington’s SSP funds on February 10, 2025, or \n11\nthat Washington had yet to submit any reimbursement requests under the relatively new award.  \n12\n87.  FEMA promised that “[u]pon the conclusion of” its newly imposed “monitoring” \n13\nperiod,  it  would  notify  Washington  if  further  action  would  be  taken.  Id.  It  also  notified \n14\nWashington of its “right to appeal” the decision to withhold the funds and/or impose special \n15\nconditions by writing to the FEMA Grant Programs Directorate by May 10, 2025. See id. (“Your \n16\norganization has the right to appeal this action within 60 days of the date of this letter.”).  \n17\n88.  FEMA sent nearly identical notices to other SSP grant recipients around this time, \n18\nas well. \n19\n89.  On April 1, 2025, before the deadline for responding to FEMA’s information \n20\nrequest or appealing the withholding decision had run, FEMA announced that it had formally \n21\nterminated the Shelter and Services Program. See Termination Notice from Cameron Hamilton, \n22\nSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator at 1 (April 1, 2025) (the “Termination \n23\nNotice”), attached as Exhibit 10. \n24\n90.  The Termination Notice did not mention the “significant concerns” that had \n25\npurportedly motivated FEMA to withhold SSP funds and impose monitoring requirements on \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 26 of 39\n \n1\ngrantees only a few weeks earlier. Nor did the Termination Notice contend that the “special \n2\nconditions”  Defendants  imposed  would  have  been  insufficient  to  correct  any  alleged \n3\nnoncompliance. See id. Indeed, the Termination Notice did not even mention that FEMA had \n4\npreviously accused Washington of failing to comply with the terms and conditions of its grant. \n5\n91.  Rather, FEMA simply stated that it was terminating Washington’s SSP award \n6\nbecause “funding . . . non-federal entities to provide shelter, food, transportation, acute medical \n7\ncare, and personal hygiene supplies for individuals released from DHS short-term holding \n8\nfacilities”—individuals  who  “often  have  no  legal  status  and  are  in  the  United  States \n9\nunlawfully”—“is not consistent with DHS’s current priorities.” Termination Notice at 1. That \n10\ndetermination, according to FEMA, justified termination under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2), which \n11\nprovides that an “award may be terminated” if it “no longer effectuates the program goals or \n12\nagency priorities.”19 See Termination Notice at 1.   \n13\n92.  FEMA thus instructed Washington to begin closing out the grant and advised that, \n14\nif  Washington  “wish[ed]  to  object  to  the  termination  of  this  award, \n15\nit should submit a written objection within 30 days.” Id. at 2. \n16\n93.  Even  where  notices  or  letters  referred  directly  to  Washington’s  grant, \n17\nDefendants’ correspondence gave no indication that their adverse actions were based on facts \n18\nand circumstances specific to Washington’s grant. Rather, Defendants’ actions appeared to be \n19\nresponsive  to  the  Administration’s  broader  policy  aims  of  restricting  federal  funding  to \n20\nnoncitizen migrants and so-called “Sanctuary Jurisdictions.” \n21\n94.  On April 23, 2025, Washington responded with its written objection to FEMA’s \n22\nunlawful decision to withhold and then terminate its SSP grant. See Letter from Cheryl Strange, \n23\nSecretary of the Washington Department of Social and Health Services at 1 (April 23, 2025), \n24\n \n25 19 The Office of Management and Budget revised this regulation in 2024 and the \noperative language is now located at 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).

Washington disputed that it had breached any obligations under the SSP \n2\ngrant, asserted that FEMA’s decisions were unlawful and were causing Washington to suffer \n3\nirreparable harm, and demanded that FEMA reverse its decision and/or respond to its objection \n4\nletter by May 9, 2025. Id. at 2. \n5\n95.  In lieu of closeout materials, Washington sent a further objection letter to FEMA \n6\non July 28, 2025, which reasserted its objections and reiterated that Washington had fully \n7\ncomplied with all SSP grant obligations and that it intended to seek reimbursement for allowable \n8\nexpenses under the award in due course. See Letter from Cheryl Strange, Secretary of the \n9\nWashington Department of Social and Health Services at 1-2 (July 28, 2025), attached as Exhibit \n10\n12. \n11\n96.  On August 20, 2025, Defendants provided “official notice” they had reached a \n12\n“final determination” to deny Washington’s appeal of Defendants’ termination of its SSP grant. \n13\nSee FEMA Shelter and Services Program Appeal Decision at 1 (Aug. 20, 2025), attached as \n14\nExhibit 13. Defendants stated that this “official notice” was not appealable and also repeated \n15\ntheir earlier demand for Washington to submit documentation to close out the award. Id. \n16\nWashington did not respond to Defendants’ August 20, 2025 letter. \n17\n97.  On September 11, 2025, Defendants advised Washington that, if Washington \n18\ndoes not submit “the required closeout documents by October 13, 2025,” they will not only \n19\n“administratively close[]” Washington’s SSP grant but will also record this as a “material \n20\nfailure,” which “may be considered in FEMA’s oversight of other current and future awards.” \n21\nFEMA Notification of Administrative Closeout (Sept. 11, 2025), attached as Exhibit 14. \n22\n98.  Defendants also threatened to “de-obligate [unspent funds] from the total grant \n23\namount,” see id., despite the fact that, as noted above, Defendants de-obligated Washington’s \n24\nentire award amount on February 10, 2025. \n25\n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  25  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 28 of 39\n \n1\n99.  Despite Defendants’ most recent threat of further adverse action, if Washington \n2\ndoes not comply with a prematurely imposed closeout deadline, Defendants have assured \n3\nWashington and the Court “that the $4,039,516 funds awarded to Washington under its SSP \n4\ngrant may not be re-obligated to another entity or potential grantee, and those funds will remain \n5\navailable through September 30, 2029 to satisfy obligations, if any, to Washington under its \n6\ngrant.” See ECF No. 11 at 2; ECF No. 12 at 1. \n7\n3.  Defendants’ termination of the Shelter and Services Program irreparably \n8 harms Washington and its subrecipients \n9 100.  When Defendants terminated the Shelter and Services Program, Washington and \n10 its intended subrecipients had already provided services that would have been reimbursable \n11 under the terms of the award. And, although Washington had not yet requested reimbursement \n12 for any such expenses, it would have done so in due course. \n13 101.  Washington also intended to work with its subrecipients to ensure that the needs \n14 of noncitizen migrants continued to be met, at least through the end of the SSP performance \n15 period on September 30, 2026.  \n16 102.  Without SSP funds, there is likely to be an overall drop in the level of services \n17 provided to noncitizen migrants in Washington; neither state or local governments or community \n18 organizations  are  likely  to  fill  the  $4,039,516  hole  left  by  Defendants’  termination  of \n19 Washington’s SSP grant. \n20 V.

Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \n2\nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n3\n575 U.S. 320, 326-327 (2015). \n4\n105.  “The Separation of Powers was an integral part of the Founders’ design” of our \n5\nconstitutional order, City & County of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1232 (9th Cir. \n6\n2018), and fidelity to that principle remains necessary to “preserve the liberty of all the people,” \n7\nCollins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 245 (2021).  \n8\n106.  Pursuant to that doctrine, the Constitution “grants the power of the purse to \n9\nCongress, not the President.” City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1231 (first citing U.S. \n10\nConst. art. I, §9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause), and then citing U.S. Const. art. I, §8, cl. 1 \n11\n(Spending Clause)). The ability to control federal spending is “[a]mong Congress’s most \n12\nimportant authorities.” Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 505 (2023). The Appropriations Clause \n13\nthus operates as a “bulwark of the Constitution’s separation of powers” and prevents the \n14\nExecutive  from  “possess[ing]  an  unbounded  power  over  the  public  purse  of  the  nation.” \n15\nU.S. Dep’t of Navy v. Fed. Lab. Rels. Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, \n16\nJ.) (internal citations omitted).  \n17\n107.  In addition, Congress also possesses exclusive power to legislate. Article I, \n18\nSection 1 of the Constitution states that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested \n19\nin  a  Congress  of  the  United  States,  which  shall  consist  of  a  Senate  and  [a]  House  of \n20\nRepresentatives.” U.S. Const. art.

Accordingly, “[a]side from the power of veto, the President is \n23\nwithout authority to thwart congressional will by canceling appropriations passed by Congress.” \n24\nCity & Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1232. That means that “‘the President does not have \n25\nunilateral authority to refuse to spend’” funds that have been lawfully appropriated by Congress \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  27  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 30 of 39\n \n1\nor  to  “‘decline  to  follow  a  statutory  mandate  or  prohibition  simply  because  of  policy \n2\nobjections.’” Id. (quoting In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013)). \n3\n108.  The Constitution further delineates the division of responsibilities between the \n4\nLegislative and Executive Branches by specifying that the Executive must “take Care that the \n5\nLaws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3; see Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, \n6\n573 U.S. 302, 327 (2014) (“Under our system of government, Congress makes [the] laws and \n7\nthe President . . . faithfully executes them.” (brackets and quotation marks omitted)). The \n8\nExecutive Branch violates the Take Care Clause where it declines to execute or otherwise \n9\nundermines statutes enacted by Congress and signed into law or duly promulgated regulations \n10\nimplementing such statutes. See In re United Mine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 F.3d 545, \n11\n551 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[T]he President is without authority to set aside congressional legislation \n12\nby executive order . . . .”); Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838) (rejecting argument \n13\nthat by charging the President with faithful execution of the laws, the Take Care clause “implies \n14\na power to forbid their execution”); see also Util. Air. Reg. Grp., 573 U.S. at 327 (noting that \n15\nthe President “act[s] at time through agencies”). \n16\n109.  The federal courts have “not hesitated to enforce the principle of separation of \n17\npowers embodied in the Constitution when its application has proved necessary for the decisions \n18\nof cases or controversies properly before it.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 123 (1976). Thus, \n19\n“whenever a separation-of-powers violation occurs, any aggrieved party with standing may file \n20\na constitutional challenge.” Collins, 594 U.S. at 245. \n21\n110.  Congress  created  the  Shelter  and  Services  Program  through  duly  enacted \n22\nauthorizing legislation and appropriated funding under that program “to support sheltering and \n23\nrelated activities provided by non-Federal entities . . . in support of relieving overcrowding in \n24\nshort-term [CBP] holding facilities.” See Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 STAT. 4730; Pub. L. No. \n25\n118-47, 138 STAT. 597, 598. Congress thus knowingly decided to spend money for the benefit \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  28  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 31 of 39\n \n1\nof a group that was certain to include some who had entered into the United States without \n2\ninspection and might ultimately be ordered removed from the country. Doing so, in Congress’ \n3\njudgment, was desirable in order to achieve its objective of relieving overcrowding in DHS \n4\ndetention facilities.  \n5\n111.  Defendants may disagree with Congress’ policy choice but that does not entitle \n6\nthem to ignore Congress’ clear funding command and their decision to terminate the Shelter and \n7\nServices Program for that reason violates the Separation of Powers doctrine. \n8  \nCOUNT II \n9 Violation of the Spending Clause \nU.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1 \n10\n112.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n11\nthe preceding paragraphs. \n12\n113.  The Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress”—not the \n13\nExecutive—“shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the \n14\nDebts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . .” \n15\nU.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1. \n16\n114.  The Spending Clause requires any conditions on federal funds to be imposed \n17\n“unambiguously,” Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981), so \n18\nthat States deciding whether to accept such funding can “exercise their choice knowingly, \n19\ncognizant of the consequences of their participation,” South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 \n20\n(1987). This is because “legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature \n21\nof a contract,” where Congress’s authority “to legislate . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily \n22\nand knowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’” Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17. Accordingly, \n23\nCongress must provide States clear notice of the applicable funding conditions. See, e.g., \n24\nArlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).  \n25\n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  29  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 32 of 39\n \n1\n115.  Nothing in the Shelter and Services Program authorizing legislation, or anywhere \n2\nelse in the U.S. Code, allows Defendants to pause, withhold, or terminate grants made under that \n3\nprogram simply because they dislike the program and find that it conflicts with their current \n4\npolicy preferences or priorities. See Termination Notice at 1 (citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2)). \n5\nAnd,  within  the  confines  of  the  Spending  Clause,  no  statute  could  empower  agencies  to \n6\nadminister grant funds in such an arbitrary fashion. Washington would not have applied for or \n7\naccepted SSP funds—with all the recordkeeping and other administrative burdens acceptance \n8\nentails—had it understood that Defendants might decide, midstream, to terminate the grant \n9\nbecause providing shelter and other services to noncitizen migrants was no longer an agency \n10\npriority. See Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 548 U.S. at 296 (analyzing Spending Clause \n11\nclaim “from the perspective of a state official who is engaged in the process of deciding whether \n12\nthe State should accept [federal] funds and the obligations that go with those funds”). \n13\n116.  Defendants’ actions to pause, withhold, and terminate the Shelter and Services \n14\nProgram based only on a change in agency priorities violates the Spending Clause. \n15  \nCOUNT III \n16 Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(A) \nArbitrary and Capricious \n17\n117.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n18\nthe preceding paragraphs. \n19\n118.  Defendants are “agencies” under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 \n20\nU.S.C. § 551(1), and their decision to pause, withhold, and eventually terminate the Shelter and \n21\nServices Program constitutes “[a]gency action made [judicially] reviewable by statute and final \n22\nagency  action  for  which  there  is  no  other  adequate  remedy  in  a  court.”  Id.  §  704;  see \n23\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997). \n24\n25\n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  30  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 33 of 39\n \n1\n119.  Under the APA, a “court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, \n2\nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n3\notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n4\n120.  An agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it is not “reasonable and reasonably \n5\nexplained.” Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). \n6\nAn agency fails to meet that standard if it “relied on factors which Congress has not intended it \n7\nto consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation \n8\nfor its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it \n9\ncould not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle \n10\nMfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). Furthermore, \n11\nwhere an agency changes its position on an issue, it must acknowledge the change, account for \n12\nthe “serious reliance interests” that may have attached to the prior policy, and provide a \n13\n“reasoned explanation” if it is “disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were \n14\nengendered by the prior policy.” F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515-16 \n15\n(2009). Finally, courts must set aside agency actions as arbitrary and capricious where, “viewing \n16\nthe  evidence  as  a  whole,”  there  is  “a  significant  mismatch  between  the  decision the \n17\n[agency] made and the rationale [it] provided.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 783 \n18\n(2019). “Accepting contrived reasons” of that sort “would defeat the purpose of the enterprise” \n19\nand convert judicial review into “an empty ritual.” Id. at 785. \n20\n121.  Defendants’  actions  pausing,  withholding,  and  terminating  the  Shelter  and \n21\nServices Program is arbitrary and capricious for myriad reasons.   \n22\n122.  To start, on January 28, Secretary Noem announced a policy that funds under the \n23\nShelter and Services Program should be withheld, even as she instructed DHS component and \n24\noffice heads to undertake a review of funding programs. But, instead of merely withholding SSP \n25\nfunds, Defendants de-obligated all (or nearly all) available SSP funds on February 10, 2025, \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  31  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 34 of 39\n \n1\nwithout notice or explanation and as an expression of their intention to terminate the program \n2\nwholesale. Defendants then proceeded to undertake a sham process—asserting a need, based on \n3\nvague  reference  to  unspecified  “concerns,”  to  investigate  whether  recipients,  including \n4\nWashington, had used SSP funds for illegal purposes, despite knowing that Washington had not \n5\nyet requested a single dollar from its SSP grant and, more importantly, that Defendants had \n6\nalready taken steps toward terminating the Program entirely. Less than a month later, however, \n7\nDefendants formally announced that their termination of the Shelter and Services Program was \n8\ncomplete in a notice that did not even briefly mention their “concerns” about SSP grants being \n9\nused to fund illegal activities. Instead, Defendants stated simply that they were terminating the \n10\nShelter and Services Program because of their policy-based objection to “provid[ing] support for \n11\nillegal aliens.” Termination Notice at 1.  \n12\n123.  Defendants’ explanations for their actions, if an explanation was offered at all, \n13\nwere contrived, pretextual, and fail to consider that Congress specifically authorized and funded \n14\nthe Shelter and Services Program to “reliev[e] overcrowding in [CBP’s] short-term holding \n15\nfacilities” by reimbursing “non-Federal entities” that provide “shelter and related activities” for \n16\nnoncitizen migrants. See Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 STAT. 597, 598. Ignoring that clear statutory \n17\npurpose, Defendants’ actions were taken for the purpose of depriving disfavored groups of \n18\nfederal  support,  including  noncitizen  migrants,  nonprofit  organizations,  and  jurisdictions \n19\ndeemed to be so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Defendants thus “relied on factors which \n20\nCongress has not intended it to consider[.]” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. at 43. \n21\n124.  Defendants have thus fallen well short of the APA’s requirement that agency \n22\nactions be “reasonable and reasonably explained.” Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. \n23\n125.  Defendants’  actions  also  run  afoul  of  the  regulations  governing  their \n24\nadministration  of  federal  awards,  including  because  they:  (1)  failed  to  provide  notice  to \n25\nWashington before zeroing out its funding on February 10, 2 C.F.R. § 200.342; (2) imposed \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 35 of 39\n \n1\nspecific conditions on SSP awards without explaining why those conditions were being imposed, \n2\nid.  § 200.208(2);  and  (3)  terminated  the  Shelter  and  Services  Program  without  allowing \n3\nWashington time to satisfy the specific conditions, appeal the withholding decision, or actually \n4\ndetermine  that  the  specific  conditions  were  insufficient  to  remedy  Washington’s  alleged \n5\nnoncompliance, see id. § 200.339.  \n6\n126.  Defendants’ failure to comply with binding regulations renders their conduct \n7\narbitrary and capricious. See Erie Boulevard Hydropower, LP v. FERC, 878 F.3d 258, 269 (D.C. \n8\nCir. 2017) (“[I]f an agency action fails to comply with its regulations, that action may be set \n9\naside as arbitrary and capricious.”). \n10  \nCOUNT IV \n11 Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C) \nContrary to Law \n12\n127.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n13\nthe preceding paragraphs. \n14\n128.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \n15\nfindings,  and  conclusions  found  to  be  .  .  .  not  in  accordance  with  law; . . . contrary  to \n16\nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n17\nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C).   \n18\n129.  The Shelter and Services Program was created by Congress in order “to support \n19\nsheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal entities . . . in support of relieving \n20\novercrowding in short-term [CBP] holding facilities.” See Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 STAT. 597, \n21\n598. Thus, by design, the Shelter and Services Program was created to provide financial support \n22\nto non-Federal entities, like Washington and its intended subrecipient partners, as reimbursement \n23\nfor the cost of providing emergency shelter and related services to noncitizen migrants following \n24\ntheir release into the community by DHS. Congress thus made a conscious choice to provide \n25\nfunds in a manner that would benefit some individuals who may have entered into the United \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  33  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 36 of 39\n \n1\nStates unlawfully because doing so was necessary to achieve its goal of “relieving overcrowding \n2\nin short-term [CBP] holding facilities.” Id. \n3\n130.  Defendants openly engaged in actions meant to contravene the clear purpose of \n4\nthe Shelter and Services Program and, in turn, violated the Constitution’s Separation of Powers \n5\nprinciple and usurped Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause. Finally, they attempt to \n6\njustify their actions by misconstruing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2), which does not, and could not, \n7\npermit their straightforward effort to undermine a duly enacted funding program they do not like.  \n8\n131.  Accordingly, Defendants have acted contrary to law and in excess of their \n9\nstatutory authority and their actions should be set aside. \n10  \nCOUNT V \n11 Ultra Vires \n12 132.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n13 the preceding paragraphs. \n14 133.  An executive agency “has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers \n15 power upon it.” Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986); see also \n16 Nat’l Fed. Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022) (“Administrative agencies \n17 are  creatures  of  statute.  They  accordingly  possess  only  the  authority  that  Congress  has \n18 provided.”). \n19 134.  Defendants may  exercise only that authority which is conferred by statute. \n20 See City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013) (federal agencies’ “power to act and \n21 how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, \n22 no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires”). \n23 135.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \n24 to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \n25 U.S. 320, 326-27 (2015). Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed equitable relief \n26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  34  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 37 of 39\n \n1\nagainst  federal  officials  who  act  “beyond  th[e]  limitations”  imposed  by  federal  statute. \n2\nLarson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949).  \n3\n136.  Because Defendants paused, withheld, and terminated the Shelter and Services \n4\nProgram for reasons that directly conflict with the very purpose for which that funding program \n5\nwas  authorized  and  appropriated,  they  acted  in  excess  of  their  statutory  authorization  to \n6\nadminister that program. \n7\n137.  Defendants’ ultra vires actions have caused and will continue to cause ongoing, \n8\nirreparable harm to Washington for which there is no adequate remedy at law. \n9\nVI.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n10\nWHEREFORE, Washington prays that this Court: \n11\n138.  Declare that Defendants’ decision to pause, withhold, or terminate the Shelter and \n12\nServices Program was unlawful because it: (a) arrogates Congress’ power to control federal \n13\nspending in violation of the Separation of Powers doctrine; (b) rests on an assertion of unfettered \n14\nauthority to terminate grants, in violation of the Spending Clause; (c) constitutes arbitrary and \n15\ncapricious agency decision-making, in violation of the APA; (d) contravenes multiple sources \n16\nof binding law, in violation of the APA; and (e) is ultra vires.  \n17\n139.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants to rescind any and all decisions \n18\nto pause, withhold, or terminate the Shelter and Services Program; \n19\n140.  Vacate and set aside Defendants’ decisions to pause, withhold, or terminate the \n20\nShelter and Services Program; \n21\n141.  Retain  jurisdiction  to  monitor  Defendants’  compliance  with  this  Court’s \n22\njudgment; \n23\n142.  Award Washington its reasonable fees, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ \n24\nfees; and  \n25\n143.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \n26  \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  35  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO. 2-25-cv-01401-BJR    Seattle, WA  98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 15     Filed 09/22/25     Page 38 of 39\n \n1 DATED this 19th day of September 2025. \n2           Respectfully submitted, \n \n3\nNICHOLAS W.

The State of Washington brings this complaint for declaratory and injunctive \n3  relief in response to the Trump Administration’s unlawful termination of the Shelter and Services \n4  Program,  a  grant  program  established  by  Congress  for  the  specific  purpose  of  enabling \n5  non-Federal entities—like the State of Washington and its cities, counties, and non-profit \n6  partners—to provide shelter and essential services to the noncitizen migrants who settled in \n7  Washington after being processed and released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n8  (DHS). \n9  2.  Washington  recognizes  the  value  of  its  immigrant  residents  and  strives  to \n10  “remain[] a place where the rights and dignity of all residents are maintained and protected,” \n11  regardless of immigration status. See Wash. Rev. Code § 43.17.425; Laws of 2019 ch. 440, E2SB \n12  5497. These values were confirmed in practice between 2022 and 2024 when, cumulatively and \n13  consistent with national trends, more than 45,000 noncitizen migrants settled in Washington after \n14  they were processed and released by DHS.  \n15  3.  For many of these newcomers, their arrival in Washington was the culmination \n16  of a long and traumatic journey that began when they were forced to flee persecution in their \n17  home countries and seek asylum in the United States. They arrived in Washington with few \n18  resources to their name, let alone stable shelter, and without access to federal support or even \n19  permission to earn a living. Unfortunately, Washington’s housing and homeless crisis response \n20  system was already over capacity at this time and stretched too thin to provide the kind of initial \n21  support that would not only meet the immediate needs of these newcomers but also allow them \n22  to find their bearings in their new home. Indeed, most of Washington’s emergency shelters were \n23  already being filled each night. Lacking better options, these noncitizen migrants sought shelter \n24  wherever they could find it, sometimes in informal encampments in King County, which may \n25  have provided a measure of stability but were an unsustainable option, particularly with winter \n26  fast approaching. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 4 of 215\n \n1  4.  More  resources  and  better  coordination  among  service  providers  were \n2  desperately  needed.  Washington  responded,  launching  the  Washington  Migrant  and \n3  Asylum-Seeker Support Project in October 2024 to connect these newcomers with support and \n4  services and backing that program with more than $25 million in state funding. Washington was \n5  joined in its humanitarian commitment by local governments, including King County and the \n6  City of Tukwila, and community organizations, like the Seattle-based shelter, Mary’s Place, \n7  which provided shelter space, educational and health programs, and other services to help ensure \n8  the basic needs of these new Washingtonians were met. \n9  5.  Congress also recognized that the cost of providing initial support to these \n10  newcomers was straining the budgets of non-Federal entities, including states like Washington. \n11  And it further acknowledged that expanding the shelter capacity of non-Federal entities was \n12  necessary and a far better option than needlessly detaining these newcomers—many of whom \n13  were seeking humanitarian protections—in overcrowded DHS detention facilities. In 2023, \n14  Congress responded to these concerns by creating the Shelter and Services Program (SSP) and \n15  appropriating federal funds “to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal \n16  entities, . . . in  support  of  relieving  overcrowding  in  short-term  holding  facilities  of  U.S. \n17  Customs  and  Border  Protection[.]”  See  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act,  2023,  Pub.  L. \n18  No. 117-328, 136 STAT. 4730 (Dec. 29, 2022).  \n19  6.  Congress reauthorized the grant program in 2024, once again appropriating \n20  federal funds to help non-Federal partners, like state governments, provide shelter to those who \n21  had been processed and released by DHS—a population Congress understood necessarily \n22  included many people who entered into the United States without inspection. See Pub. L. \n23  No. 118-47, 138 STAT. 597, 598 (March 23, 2024). \n24  7.  In recognition of the promising but costly steps Washington and its local partners \n25  had taken to provide shelter to noncitizen migrants, as well as the continuing need for additional \n26  resources,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA)  awarded  Washington \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 5 of 215\n \n1  $4,039,516 in SSP funds to reimburse Washington and its local partners for the costs they had \n2  already incurred and to increase their capacity to provide more of the same.  \n3  8.  To date, Washington and its partners have not received a single dollar from that \n4  award. \n5  9.  Almost as soon as President Trump was sworn into office for his second term, he \n6  began an all-out assault on grant programs that were distributing federal funds to recipients and \n7  causes  he  dislikes.  In  particular,  he  directed  DHS  “to  ensure  that  so-called  ‘sanctuary’ \n8  jurisdictions . . . do  not  receive  access  to  Federal  funds”  and  to  “[t]erminate”  any  grants \n9  “providing Federal funding to non-governmental organizations supporting or providing services, \n10  either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens[.]” Protecting the American People \n11  Against Invasion, Exec. Order 14159 §§ 17, 19, 90 Fed. Reg. 8443, 8446-47 (Jan. 29, 2025).   \n12  10.  Defendants took prompt action to carry out these directives against the Shelter \n13  and Services Program. \n14  11.  First, on February 10, 2025, Defendants quietly zeroed out Washington’s entire \n15  SSP award, taking action behind the scenes to reduce the amount of SSP funds from which \n16  Washington could request a reimbursement for covered expenses from $4,039,516 to $0.  \n17  12.  Second, on March 11, 2025, Defendants provided Washington with a sham \n18  “notice” of its alleged noncompliance with the terms of its SSP grant and informed Washington \n19  that its funding would be withheld until further notice. Defendants made vague reference to their \n20  “significant concerns that SSP funding” was “going to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal \n21  activities,” but provided no evidence to support their concerns about the Shelter and Services \n22  Program, generally, or Washington’s use of SSP funds, specifically. Instead, Defendants gave \n23  Washington 30 days to comply with onerous information requests—including the demand that \n24  Washington provide the “names and contact information” for every individual who received \n25  services from its subrecipients—or 60 days to lodge an appeal with FEMA. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 6 of 215\n \n1  13.  Third, and before either of FEMA’s deadlines had expired, Defendants officially \n2  terminated Washington’s SSP grant on April 1, 2025. Defendants’ termination notice made no \n3  mention of the “significant concerns” hinted at in FEMA’s March 11 letter but, rather, explained \n4  that they were terminating Washington’s SSP grant because the Shelter and Services Program \n5  funds “provide[] support for illegal aliens,” which  “is  not consistent with  DHS’s  current \n6  priorities.”  \n7  14.  When it authorized and appropriated funds to support the Shelter and Services \n8  Program, Congress could not have been clearer that these funds were intended “to support \n9  sheltering  and  related  activities  provided  by  non-Federal  entities,”  in  order  to  “reliev[e] \n10  overcrowding” in U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) short-term holding facilities. See \n11  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 STAT. 4730 (Dec. 29, 2022). \n12  Achieving that goal necessarily required providing support, in the form of emergency shelter \n13  and other essential services, for a population that was certain to include individuals who entered \n14  the United States without inspection, who Defendants derisively refer to as “illegal aliens.”  \n15  15.  Defendants have made clear their disdain for noncitizen migrants, especially \n16  those who entered without inspection and seek humanitarian protection in the United States. \n17  Likewise, Defendants have made clear their opposition to jurisdictions, like Washington, that \n18  protect the rights and dignity of all residents, regardless of immigration status, and leave the cost \n19  and responsibility of enforcing federal, civil immigration law to the federal government. And \n20  they have further made clear their view that neither should receive federal support of any kind. \n21  But Defendants’ policy preference, no matter how much of a priority it might be for them, cannot \n22  override the policy priorities that Congress has expressed through statute.  \n23  16.  Here, Congress’ decision to authorize and fund the Shelter and Services Program \n24  provides a clear expression of its policy judgment to, in Defendants’ verbiage, “provide[] support \n25  for illegal aliens” after their release by DHS.  \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 7 of 215\n \n1  17.  Defendants had no lawful basis to override Congress’ judgment or the plain \n2  purpose  of  its  funding  program  and  their  actions  to  pause,  withhold,  and  then  terminate \n3  Washington’s SSP grant violates the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine, the \n4  Spending Clause, the Administrative Procedure Act, and is additionally ultra vires.  \n5  18.  The Court must set aside Defendants’ unlawful actions and compel the restoration \n6  of the Shelter and Services Program so that, consistent with Congress’ wishes, Washington can \n7  continue supporting its new immigrant neighbors with shelter and essential services. \n8 \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9  19.  The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n10  1346(a)(2). The Court has further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, \n11  28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202. Jurisdiction is also proper under the judicial review provisions \n12  of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n13  20.  Venue  is  proper  in  the  Western  District  of  Washington  under  28  U.S.C. \n14  §§ 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). Defendants are United States officers, employees, and/or agencies sued \n15  in their official capacities. Plaintiff State of Washington is a resident of the Western District of \n16  Washington. Venue is appropriate in the Seattle Division because a substantial part of the events \n17  or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred and are continuing to occur within this \n18  judicial division, including in King County, where the shelter and other services Washington \n19  intended to support through its SSP grant were provided. \n20 \nIII.  PARTIES \n21  21.  Plaintiff State of Washington, represented by and through its Attorney General, \n22  Nicholas W. Brown, is a sovereign state of the United States of America. The Attorney General \n23  is the chief legal adviser to the State. The Attorney General’s powers and duties include acting \n24  in  federal  court  on  behalf  of  the  State  on  matters  of  public  concern.  Wash.  Rev.  Code \n25  § 43.10.030(1); Wash. Const. art. III § 21. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  5  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 8 of 215\n \n1  22.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a federal agency \n2  headquartered in Washington, D.C. DHS administers the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), \n3  including the grant awarded to Washington under that program, which is the subject of this \n4  action.  \n5  23.  Defendant Kristi Noem is the Secretary of DHS and serves as that agency’s \n6  highest ranking official. She is charged with the supervision and management of all decisions \n7  and actions of that agency, including decisions and actions concerning the Shelter and Services \n8  Program. She is sued in her official capacity.  \n9  24.  Defendant Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a federal agency \n10  within DHS that coordinates operational and logistical disaster response and administers many \n11  of DHS’s federal grant programs, including the Shelter and Services Program. \n12  25.  Defendant David Richardson is the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the \n13  Administrator of FEMA and serves as FEMA’s highest ranking official. He is sued in his official \n14  capacity. \n15 \nIV.  ALLEGATIONS \n16 \nA.  Congress Created the Shelter and Services Program to Reimburse Non-Federal \nPartners, Like Washington, for Providing Shelter to Noncitizen Migrants Released \n17 \nFrom DHS’s Custody  \n \n18 \n1.  Faced with significant need, Washington and local partners provided shelter \nand essential resources to newly arrived noncitizen migrants \n19 \n26.  “Immigrants make a significant contribution to” the State of Washington and the \n20 \nState has, accordingly, enacted “policies that recognize” the importance of noncitizens to its \n21 \neconomy and ensure that the state “remains a place where the rights and dignity of all residents,” \n22 \nregardless  of  their  immigration  status,  “are  maintained  and  protected.”  Wash.  Rev.  Code \n23 \n§ 43.17.425; Laws of 2019, ch. 440, § 1. It was with these values firmly in mind that, beginning \n24 \nin  2022,  Washington  welcomed  tens  of  thousands  of  noncitizen  migrants  who  settled  in \n25 \nWashington after they were released from DHS custody near the southwest border. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 9 of 215\n \n1  27.  The swell of noncitizen migrants settling in Washington was connected to broader \n2  migration trends that resulted in millions of individuals entering the United States through the \n3  southwest border between 2019 and 2024,1 many of whom sought humanitarian protection, \n4  including asylum. Detaining everyone it encountered during this period would have stretched \n \n5  DHS resources well past the breaking point, threatening national security, and creating inhumane \n6  and dangerous conditions of confinement in the process.2  \n7  28.  Accordingly, those individuals not subject to expedited removal were either \n8  transferred to another agency or released into the United States with instructions to appear at \n9  future immigration proceedings.3 Between 2019 and 2024, nearly 3 million individuals were \n10  released by U.S. Border Patrol with notices to appear or report, on their own recognizance, as an \n11  exercise of prosecutorial discretion, or as part of an alternative to detention or parole with \n12  conditions programs.4 \n13  29.

Upon  arrival,  these  newcomers  faced  numerous  barriers  to  securing  stable \n4  shelter. The long and expensive journey to Washington left many without much money. Some \n5  were also burdened by the trauma of the hardships that forced them to flee from their countries \n6  of  birth.  And,  given  their  immigration  status,  most  lacked  access  to  federal  support  or \n7  employment authorization. \n8  31.  Unfortunately, Washington’s housing and homeless crisis response system was \n9  already over capacity at this time and stretched too thin to provide the kind of initial support that \n10  would not only meet the immediate needs of these newcomers but also allow them to find their \n11  bearings in their new home. Indeed, most of Washington’s emergency shelters were already \n12  filled each night. Unsurprisingly, of the estimated 21,457 noncitizen migrants who arrived in \n13  Washington in 2023, approximately 3,841, or 18 percent, reported experiencing homelessness.  \n14  32.  The unsustainable strain of this additional need was abundantly clear to local \n15  shelters, like Seattle-based Mary’s Place, which saw the amount of shelter space it allocated to \n16  noncitizen migrants jump from 25 percent in 2023 to 48 percent in 2024. \n17  33.  Statewide, Washington estimates that approximately 1,200 to 1,500 noncitizen \n18  migrants were reliant on unstable housing options in 2024, including hotels, family shelters, or \n19 \n20 \n \n21 \nhttps://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47681 (describing the “[s]everal factors” that “led DHS \nto release more encountered migrants into the United States than had been typical” during this \n22 \nperiod, including shifts in “the demographic composition” of encountered migrants away from \nsinge  adults  and  toward  “family  units”  and  individuals  with  “health-  or  age-related \n23 \nvulnerabilities”). \n24  5 Webster and Singer, supra note 4 at 4; see also U.S. Immigr. and Customs Enf’t, Fiscal \nYear  2023:  ICE  Annual  Report  at  9  (Dec.  29,  2023),  https://www.ice.gov/doclib/ \n25  eoy/iceAnnualReportFY2023.pdf  (“ICE  does  not  transport  released  noncitizens  to  their \ndestination in the interior of the United States and does not choose where released noncitizens \n26  ultimately settle.”). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

The largest tent encampment formed in early 2023 on the property of the Riverton \n4  Park United Methodist Church (RPUMC) in the City of Tukwila. At its peak, upwards of 300 \n5  noncitizen migrants, mainly from Venezuela, Angola, and Congo, were living in “50 to 60 tents” \n6  that had been “crammed into the church’s front lawn, around side buildings and on the pavement \n7  of what used to be a parking lot.”7 The RPUMC encampment residents included families with \n8  children, as well as pregnant and post-partum people.  \n9  35.  For a group that included those who arrived in Washington after “surviving war, \n10  rape and other atrocities,” encampments provided a measure of relative safety and stability.8 But \n11  they also lacked adequate protection from the elements or appropriate sanitation infrastructure, \n12  which presented numerous public health and safety issues.9  \n13 \n14 \n15 \n \n16 \n6  See,  e.g.,  Anna  Patrick,  Asylum-seekers  removed  from  Kent  encampment;  many \nquestions  remain,  Seattle  Times  (Sept.  28,  2024),  https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-\n17 \nnews/homeless/asylum-seekers-removed-from-kent-encampment-many-questions-remain/; \nGene Johnson, Hundreds of asylum-seekers are camped out near Seattle.

The City of Tukwila eventually proclaimed a state of emergency at the RPUMC \n2  encampment, finding that the site “constitutes a humanitarian crisis where the need for resources \n3  for safe sanitary shelter is acute and beyond the capabilities of Tukwila itself to manage.”10 \n4  37.  Washington recognized that, without additional resources and better coordination \n5  among service providers, the needs of its new noncitizen migrant residents would continue to go \n6  unmet. True to its values, Washington responded, launching the Washington Migrant and \n7  Asylum-Seeker Support Project (the “WA MASS Project”) in October 2024, which increased \n8  the state’s capacity to help the recently arrived noncitizen migrants meet their most basic needs: \n9  suitable shelter; access to food, water, and acute medical care; and basic hygiene supplies, like \n10  clean diapers.  \n11  38.  Specifically, the WA MASS Project vested the Washington Department of Social \n12  & Health Services (DSHS) Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance (ORIA) with new legal \n13  authority  to  “administer  services  to  immigrants  who  are  ineligible  for  federal  [refugee \n14  resettlement]  services”  and  to  “contract  with . . . community-based  organizations”  for  that \n15  purpose. Wash. Rev. Code § 74.74.060; Laws of 2024 ch. 153, SHB 2368. The Legislature also \n16  appropriated $25 million for the WA Mass Project, which funded a one-year pilot project \n17  designed to provide essential services for noncitizen migrants who had entered the United States \n18  in 2022 or later, did not qualify for federal refugee resettlement assistance, had not been granted \n19  a permanent immigration status, and had a household income below 200% of the federal poverty \n20  guidelines.11 \n21  39.  Through the WA MASS Project, Washington sought to build a statewide network \n22  of organizations that could deliver a coordinated response to meet the specific and immediate \n23 \n \n24  10  Allan  Ekberg,  Mayor  of  the  City  of  Tukwila,  Proclamation  (Oct.  6,  2023), \nhttps://www.tukwilawa.gov/wp-content/uploads/Emergency-Proclamation-re-Riverton-Park-\n25  United-Methodist-Church-RPUMC.pdf. \n11 Press Release, Wash.

The funds available through the WA MASS \n2  Project were competitively awarded to organizations that could provide services in six core \n3  service  areas:  (1) reception  and  navigation  services,  (2) emergency  shelter,  (3) housing \n4  navigation  and  rental  assistance,  (4) culturally  responsive  case  management  services, \n5  (5) immigration-related legal services, and (6) education, employment, and training services.  \n6  40.  Although the support provided through the WA MASS Project was an important \n7  expression of Washington’s values, as well as an important infusion of material support, \n8  Washington recognized that more was needed to ensure that the essential needs of its noncitizen \n9  migrant residents were met, particularly given the time-limited nature of the WA MASS pilot \n10  program. Accordingly, Washington looked to expand the reach of the WA MASS Project by \n11  adding federal Shelter and Services Program funds into its resource mix.  \n12 \n2.  Congress  created  the  Shelter  and  Services  Program  to  ensure  states, \nlocalities, and community organizations could meet the needs of noncitizen \n13 \nmigrants, after their release from DHS custody \n14 \n41.  Recognizing the need for additional resources to help local communities meet the \n15 \nneeds of noncitizen migrants, in 2019, Congress began appropriating funds to FEMA for \n16 \ndisbursement “to jurisdictions or local recipient organizations serving communities that have \n17 \nexperienced a significant influx of” noncitizen migrants as reimbursement “for costs incurred in \n18 \nproviding services” to those newcomers. See Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for \n19 \nHumanitarian Assistance and Security at the Southern Border Act, Pub. L. No. 116-26, Title III, \n20 \n133 Stat. 1020, 1020-21 (July 1, 2019). \n21 \n42.

Congress continued to support the EFSP-H grant program with further \n2  appropriations in 2021 and 2022. See American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub. L. No. 117-2, \n3  135 Stat. 79 (March 11, 2021) ($110,000,000); Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. \n4  No. 117-103, 136 Stat. 345 (March 15, 2022) ($150,000,000).  \n5  43.  In 2023, Congress established the Shelter and Services Program by appropriating \n6  $800,000,000 “to support sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal entities . . . in \n7  support  of  relieving  overcrowding  in  short-term  [CBP]  holding  facilities.”  Consolidated \n8  Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 STAT. 4730 (Dec. 29, 2022). In an \n9  accompanying Joint Explanatory Statement, Congress clarified that “the $800 million [wa]s \n10  appropriated for” the creation of the SSP but, “‘[i]n order to avoid any interruption in support \n11  for CBP short-term holding facility decompression,’ up to $785 million” was available for award \n12  under the existing EFSP-H grant program.12 SSP, which awards funds directly to recipients, was \n13  meant to replace the EFSP-H, which distributed funds to recipients through a national board.13 \n14  44.  Congress reauthorized the Shelter and Services Program in March 2024 and \n15  directed CBP to transfer $650,000,000 to FEMA “to support sheltering and related activities \n16  provided by non-Federal entities, in support of relieving overcrowding in [CBP’s] short-term \n17  holding facilities.” Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 \n18  STAT. 597, 598 (March 23, 2024). \n19  45.  On April 12, 2024, FEMA announced that it was accepting applications for \n20  $340,900,000 in competitive SSP grant funds, which it would award by September 30, 2024. \n21  See FY 2024 SSP-C Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), attached as Exhibit 1. FEMA \n22  expressly stated that these funds were being made available, “[a]s directed by Congress, . . . to \n23  enable non-federal entities to off-set allowable costs incurred for services associated with \n \n24 \n12 U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Fiscal Year 2023 Report to Congress at 2 (October 18, \n2023), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023_1018_fema_shelter_and_services\n25 \n_program_fy23.pdf.  \n26  13 Id. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  12  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

L. No. 118-47, 138 STAT. at 598). \n4  46.  Although the grants were awarded on September 30, 2024, their performance \n5  period was October 1, 2023 – September 30, 2026, which meant that grant recipients could seek \n6  reimbursement for any allowable expenses incurred during that period. See id at 7. \n7  47.  As specified in the NOFO, state and local governments, Native American tribes, \n8  and certain non-profit organizations were eligible to apply and would be evaluated based on their \n9  ability to meet “Performance Measures,” such as the number of meals and nights of lodging they \n10  had provided or expected to provide, and the number of “noncitizen migrants served through \n11  translation services.” See id. at 6-7.  \n12  48.  In keeping with the purpose of SSP, only services provided to “noncitizen \n13  migrants released from a DHS facility” were reimbursable under SSP grants. See NOFO at 47. \n14  In addition, only costs related to the “allowable activities” designated by FEMA in an appendix \n15  to the NOFO were subject to reimbursement. See id. at 47-51. \n16  49.  In order to be reimbursed for an allowable expense under an SSP award, grant \n17  recipients were required to submit documentation, including the names, Alien Registration \n18  Numbers, and evidence of DHS processing, for the individuals being served, as well as proof of \n19  payment for the allowable services provided. See id. at 52-53. \n20 \n3.  FEMA awards Washington more than $4 million in SSP funds to continue \nproviding shelter and services to noncitizen migrants in Washington  \n21 \n50.  Washington submitted its application for a competitive Shelter and Services \n22 \nGrant on June 21, 2024. See Washington SSP Application, attached as Exhibit 2. \n23 \n51.  In  its  application,  Washington  proposed  disbursing  SSP  funds  to  three \n24 \nsubrecipient partners, which it identified as well-suited to help advance the complementary goals \n25 \nof the WA MASS Project and SSP: the City of Tukwila, Public Health - Seattle & King County \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  13  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 16 of 215\n \n1  (Public Health), and the non-profit organization, Mary’s Place Seattle. Washington planned to \n2  identify additional subrecipient partner organizations at a later date that would also be able to \n3  provide shelter and other essential services to noncitizen migrants.  \n4  52.  Washington’s  proposed  subrecipients  each  had  established  track  records  of \n5  successfully  providing  shelter  and  other  services  to  noncitizen  migrants  and  Washington \n6  anticipated that, collectively and with support from SSP funds, they would be able to provide \n7  shelter and other services to approximately 525 noncitizen migrants each day.  \n8  53.  In support of its application, Washington described the services its intended \n9  subrecipients had already provided to noncitizen migrants, which would have been reimbursable \n10  and/or extended through Washington’s SSP grant. \n11  54.  For instance, in October 2023, the City of Tukwila paid for the construction and \n12  operation of a large, heated tent structure at the RPUMC encampment, and also hired a \n13  consulting firm with experience doing outreach and providing services to unhoused populations. \n14  See id. at 4-21. Washington estimated that the City of Tukwila’s efforts at RPUMC and other \n15  locations throughout the city were “support[ing] 200 to 250 people per night.” Id. at 2. \n16  55.  Washington also sought SSP funds to support Public Health’s work providing \n17  culturally relevant health information and acute medical care for noncitizen migrants residing in \n18  various encampments and hotels in Seattle and King County, including at RPUMC. In particular, \n19  Public Health hired community navigators—health workers with relevant cultural and language \n20  competencies—that provided in-language guidance and support to  noncitizen migrants  on \n21  critical topics for those living in a congregate shelter with limited facilities. Through the \n22  community navigators, Public Health was able to provide information on best practices for \n23  hygiene and sanitation, rodent prevention, food safety, severe weather safety, vaccination, and \n24  health care system navigation, including health care enrollment and linkage to care.  \n25  56.  Beyond its work to share information with noncitizen migrants, Public Health \n26  also provided goods and services. For instance, it provided direct healthcare through its Mobile \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  14  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

Washington also planned to use SSP funds to support the work of Mary’s Place, \n5  a Seattle-based non-profit with a long history of providing emergency shelter for unhoused \n6  families, including pregnant people, families with infants or medically fragile children, and \n7  families fleeing domestic violence. Washington estimated that Mary’s Place was able to serve \n8  approximately 150 noncitizen migrants per day with a 24/7 shelter operation that included, in \n9  addition to bed space, a centralized food service, connections to housing specialists, healthcare, \n10  youth programming, legal clinics, job fairs, and resume workshops.  \n11  58.  In addition to the City of Tukwila, Public Health, and Mary’s Place, Washington \n12  planned to identify through the WA MASS Project’s competitive application process one or \n13  more additional partner organizations that were expected to provide shelter and services to an \n14  additional 425 noncitizen migrants each day. \n15  59.  As  part  of  its  application,  Washington  certified  that  it  and  its  intended \n16  subrecipients either had or would develop the “internal controls and processes” necessary “to \n17  clearly identify migrants who will be receiving services to be funded by SSP dollars and to ensure \n18  said migrants were processed and released from DHS apart from other populations served.” \n19  See Washington SSP Application Worksheet (Tab 5), attached as Exhibit 3. Washington further \n20  certified that, when seeking reimbursement for services rendered, it would submit “verified \n21  status  and  release  dates . . . by  Alien  Registration  Number . . . or  evidence  of  DHS \n22  processing . . . for any A-numbers being submitted with this application.” Id. \n23  60.  On  September  26,  2024,  FEMA  notified  Washington  that  its  SSP  grant \n24  application had been approved and that it had been awarded $4,039,516. See SSP Award Package \n25  at 1, attached as Exhibit 4. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  15  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

Included  with  FEMA’s  Award  Package  was  an  Award  Summary,  which \n2  described the purpose of the Shelter and Services Program: \n \n3 \nThe  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2024  Shelter  and  Services  Program  (SSP)  provides \nnon-federal entities that serve noncitizen migrants recently released from DHS \n4 \ncustody to temporarily provide shelter, food, transportation, acute medical care, \n5  personal hygiene supplies, and labor necessary to manage cases to provide these \nservices, and to provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to \n6 \ntemporarily  shelter  noncitizen  migrants  recently  released  from  DHS  custody, \nincluding renovations and modifications to existing facilities. \n7 \n8  Id. at 2 (emphases added). \n9  62.  In connection with the award, FEMA also provided an approved scope of \n10  work for Washington’s SSP grant, which included the following budgeted amounts:  \n11  a.   $25,237.66 for DSHS, through a subrecipient partner, to rent hotel/motel \n12  rooms as emergency shelter for an estimated 500-600 noncitizen migrants; \n13  b.  $284,035.32 for the City of Tukwila’s six-month rental of a large tent at \n14  RPUMC, which provided shelter to 75 noncitizen migrants; \n15  c.  $182,500 for the City of Tukwila’s operation of a food pantry at the \n16  RPUMC;  \n17  d.  $180,000 for the  City of  Tukwila serving  12,000 meals to  noncitizen \n18  migrant residents at RPUMC and hotels in Tukwila; \n19  e.  $688,098.92 for the City of Tukwila retaining the services of Innovative \n20  Impact  Strategies,  LLC  (i2),  which  was  engaged  to  help  manage  the \n21  temporary shelter and services being provided to the 250-300 noncitizen \n22  migrants residing at RPUMC; \n23  f.  $22,947.99 to the City of Tukwila for garbage and refuse collection, site \n24  cleanup and disposal of debris; \n25  g.  $10,000 to the City of Tukwila for translation and interpretation services to \n26  help with community and external communications at RPUMC; \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  16  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

In total, FEMA’s approved scope of work contemplated that Washington would \n25  allocate its $4,039,516 award to subrecipients in the following amounts: $1,507,088.34 for the \n26  City of Tukwila; $1,218,595.18 for Public Health; and $1,080,741 for Mary’s Place.

Although the entire award amount was obligated to Washington, FEMA placed \n4  payment holds on $1,480,000, pending its review of more detailed cost breakdowns and \n5  justifications. Washington anticipated being able to provide that information and, over the \n6  course of the performance period, utilizing the full award amount. \n7  65.  These funds would have been used to reimburse allowable expenses for services \n8  that had already been provided, as well as to support the continued provision of services by \n9  Washington’s intended subrecipients.   \n10  66.  Washington  entered  into  a  client  service  contract  with  Mary’s  Place  on \n11  February 20, 2025, pursuant to which the state is obligated to reimburse Mary’s Place for the \n12  full amount it planned to allocate from the SSP award. Given the uncertainty created by \n13  Defendants’ actions, Washington decided not to move forward with similar client service \n14  contracts for the City of Tukwila and Public Health.  \n15 \nB.  The Trump Administration Illegally Cut Funding Appropriated by Congress for \nthe Shelter and Services Program \n16 \n \n1.  President  Trump  directed  DHS  to  eliminate  federal  funding  from \n17 \n“Sanctuary Jurisdictions” \n18  67.  As soon as he took office, President Trump issued an executive order entitled \n19  “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” (the “Invasion EO”). Exec. Order 14159, \n20  90 Fed. Reg. 8443 (Jan. 29, 2025). The Invasion EO asserted that the United States had \n21  experienced an “unprecedented flood of illegal immigration” and that this influx “has cost \n22  taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.” Id. at 8443.  \n23  68.  The Invasion EO also called for a “Funding Review” and directed the Secretary \n24  of DHS, among other agency officials, to review “all contracts, grants or other agreements \n25  providing federal funding to non-governmental organizations” that support or provide services, \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  18  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

Id. at 8447.  \n3  69.  The Invasion EO further directed the DHS Secretary to ensure that “so-called \n4  ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions” did not receive federal funds. Id. at 8446. \n5  70.  DHS considers Washington to be a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”14  \n6  71.  On January 28, 2025, Secretary Noem issued a memorandum directing DHS \n7  “Component and Office Heads” to place “on hold pending review” all DHS “grant disbursements \n8  and assessments of grant applications that: (a) go to non-profit organizations or for which \n9  non-profit organizations are eligible, and (b) touch in any way on immigration.” Secretary Noem, \n10  Memorandum for Component and Office Heads (Jan. 28, 2025) (the “January 28 Noem Memo”), \n11  attached as Exhibit 5. Secretary Noem gave the DHS component heads one week to “provide a \n12  report to the Undersecretary for Management” with “a summary of every grant covered by this \n13  memorandum and its status.” Id. \n14  72.  The Secretary’s reason for this sweeping decision “include[d]” her unsupported \n15  “concerns” that the grants: (1) “may be funding illegal activities, such as encouraging or inducing \n16  illegal immigration, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv), or illegal harboring of illegal aliens, 8 U.S.C. \n17  §§ 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii)-(iii)”; (2) may include “racially discriminatory language”; and (3) “may not \n18  be an efficient use of government resources.” Id. \n19  73.  Despite having tasked DHS component and office heads with identifying covered \n20  grant programs, Secretary Noem summarily asserted that the “hold . . . appl[ies] to the Shelter \n21  and Services Program[.]” Id.; see also Decl. of Cameron Hamilton at ¶ 9, City of New York v. \n22  Trump, 25-cv-1510 (S.D.N.Y.), ECF No. 17-1 (testifying that, based on the January 28 Noem \n23 \n \n24  14 See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Sanctuary Jurisdictions Defying Fed.

Indeed, the transaction history for Washington’s SSP grant on USASpending.gov shows \n5  that, on February 10, 2025, FEMA revised Washington’s award downward by the full award \n6  amount of $4,039,516, leaving $0 outlayed or obligated.15  \n7   \n8   \n9   \n10   \n11   \n12   \n13   \n14   \n15   \n16  75.  On information and belief, FEMA took similar action to zero out all other SSP \n17  awards, as well. \n18  76.  FEMA’s deobligation16 of Washington’s entire $4,039,516 SSP award rendered \n19  Washington unable to seek reimbursement for allowable expenses incurred under the grant. \n20  77.  FEMA did not notify Washington of this action, either before or after it occurred. \n21  78.  On February 14, 2025, Mr. Hamilton, the Senior Official Performing the Duties \n22  of the Administrator at FEMA, issued Grant Processing Guidance, which contained “additional \n \n23 \n15 See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., EMW-2024-SP-05140 (last visited on July 25, \n2025), https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_EMW-2024-SP-05140_7022. \n24 \n16 Deobligation is “[a]n agency’s cancellation or downward adjustment of previously \n25  incurred obligations.” U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, A Glossary of Terms Used in the \nFederal Budget Process, GAO-05-734SP at 44 (Sept. 2005), https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-\n26  05-734sp.pdf.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  20  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

The FEMA Grant Processing Guidance thus \n5  put yet another bureaucratic layer between the funds and SSP grant recipients, thereby ensuring \n6  they remained unavailable. Id. \n7  79.  Next, having “paused” access to SSP funds based on their availability to non-\n8  profit organizations and connection to immigration, see January 28 Noem Memo, Secretary \n9  Noem directed all DHS components, including FEMA, “to review all federal financial assistance \n10  awards  to  determine  if  Department  funds,  directly  or  indirectly,  are  going  to  sanctuary \n11  jurisdictions” and to “cease providing federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions” identified in \n12  that process.” See Memorandum for All Agencies and Offices, Restricting Grant Funding for \n13  Sanctuary Jurisdictions (Feb. 19, 2025) (the “February 19 Noem Memo”), attached as Exhibit 7. \n14  80.  FEMA carried out the directives imposed by the January 28 Noem Memo and the \n15  February 19 Noem Memo by: (1) identifying grant programs that, in FEMA’s view, do not “align \n16  with Administration and Secretary priorities on non-governmental organizations, immigration, \n17  and sanctuary jurisdictions”; and (2) recommending that DHS place “conditions or restrictions” \n18  on all Shelter and Services Program awards, see Approval of FEMA-Administered Grant \n19  Disbursements at 1-2, attached as Exhibit 8, and further (3) review all SSP awards “for \n20  [t]ermination,” see id., Table A.  \n21  81.

Defendants imposed “special conditions” on Washington’s SSP grant and \nthen terminated it entirely \n2 \n82.  On March 11, 2025, FEMA notified Washington that, in light of its “significant \n3 \nconcerns that SSP funding is going to entities engaged in facilitating illegal activities,” it was \n4 \n“temporarily withholding payments” under the SSP grant “pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.339(a)” \n5 \nand  “instituting  specific  conditions . . . pursuant  to  2  C.F.R.  § 200.208.”  See  Letter  from \n6 \nCameron Hamilton at 1 (March 11, 2025) (the “March 11 Letter”), attached as Exhibit 9.  \n7 \n83.  As “special conditions,” FEMA announced that it would conduct “additional \n8 \nmonitoring and review of [Washington’s] award(s)”; require Washington to provide FEMA with \n9 \ndocuments and information regarding the individuals to whom services had been provided under \n10 \nthe SSP award within 30 days, including “names and contact information” for those individuals; \n11 \nand  submit  affidavits  “attesting”  that  neither  Washington  nor  its  subrecipients  have  any \n12 \n“knowledge or suspicion that” the SSP funds had been used in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324. See \n13 \nid. at 1-2.  \n14 \n84.  FEMA further directed Washington not “to incur any additional costs under the \n15 \ngrant,” until further notice. Id. at 2. \n16 \n85.  FEMA did not identify specific incidents or evidence that gave rise to the \n17 \n“significant concerns” that supposedly justified the imposition of these conditions. Nor did it \n18 \nacknowledge that it had already zeroed out Washington’s SSP funds on February 10, 2025, or \n19 \nthat Washington had yet to submit any reimbursement requests under the relatively new award.  \n20 \n86.  FEMA promised that “[u]pon the conclusion of” its newly imposed “monitoring” \n21 \nperiod,  it  would  notify  Washington  if  further  action  would  be  taken.  Id.  It  also  notified \n22 \nWashington of its “right to appeal” the decision to withhold the funds and/or impose special \n23 \nconditions by writing to the FEMA Grant Programs Directorate by May 10, 2025. See id. (“Your \n24 \norganization has the right to appeal this action within 60 days of the date of this letter.”).  \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  22  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

On April 1, 2025, before Washington’s deadline for responding to FEMA’s \n2 \ninformation  request  or  appealing  the  withholding  decision  had  run,  FEMA  terminated \n3 \nWashington’s SSP grant. See Termination Notice from Cameron Hamilton, Senior Official \n4 \nPerforming the Duties of the Administrator at 1 (April 1, 2025) (the “Termination Notice”), \n5 \nattached as Exhibit 10. \n6 \n88.  The Termination Notice did not mention the “significant concerns” that had \n7 \npurportedly motivated FEMA to withhold Washington’s SSP funds and impose monitoring \n8 \nrequirements only a few weeks earlier. Nor did the Termination Notice contend that the “special \n9 \nconditions” Defendants imposed would have been insufficient to correct Washington’s alleged \n10 \nnoncompliance. See id. Indeed, the Termination Notice did not even mention that FEMA had \n11 \npreviously accused Washington of failing to comply with the terms and conditions of its grant. \n12 \n89.  Rather, FEMA simply stated that it was terminating Washington’s SSP award \n13 \nbecause “funding . . . non-federal entities to provide shelter, food, transportation, acute medical \n14 \ncare, and personal hygiene supplies for individuals released from DHS short-term holding \n15 \nfacilities”—individuals  who  “often  have  no  legal  status  and  are  in  the  United  States \n16 \nunlawfully”—“is not consistent with DHS’s current priorities.” Termination Notice at 1. That \n17 \ndetermination, according to FEMA, justified termination under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2), which \n18 \nprovides that an “award may be terminated” if it “no longer effectuates the program goals or \n19 \nagency priorities.”17 See Termination Notice at 1.   \n20 \n90.  FEMA thus instructed Washington to begin closing out the grant and advised that, \n21 \nif  Washington  “wish[ed]  to  object  to  the  termination  of  this  award, \n22 \nit should submit a written objection within 30 days.” Id. at 2. \n23 \n24 \n \n25  17 The Office of Management and Budget revised this regulation in 2024 and the \noperative language is now located at 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). See 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089 \n26  (Apr. 22, 2024). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

On April 23, 2025, Washington responded with its written objection to FEMA’s \n2 \nunlawful decision to withhold and then terminate its SSP grant. See Letter from Cheryl Strange, \n3 \nSecretary of the Washington Department of Social and Health Services at 1 (April 23, 2025), \n4 \nattached as Exhibit 11. Washington disputed that it had breached any obligations under the SSP \n5 \ngrant, asserted that FEMA’s decisions were unlawful and were causing Washington to suffer \n6 \nirreparable harm, and demanded that FEMA reverse its decision and/or respond to its objection \n7 \nletter by May 9, 2025. Id. at 2.  \n8 \n92.  As of the date of this filing, FEMA has neither responded to Washington’s \n9 \nobjection  letter,  nor  reversed  its  unlawful  decisions  to  pause,  withhold,  and  terminate \n10 \nWashington’s SSP grant. \n11 \n3.  The loss of SSP funds irreparably harms Washington and its subrecipients \n12 \n93.  When  Defendants  terminated  Washington’s  SSP  grant,  Washington  and  its \n13 \nintended subrecipients had already provided services that would have been reimbursable under \n14 \nthe terms of the award. And, although Washington had not yet requested reimbursement for any \n15 \nsuch expenses, it would have done so in due course. \n16 \n94.  Washington also intended to work with its subrecipients to ensure that the needs \n17 \nof noncitizen migrants continued to be met, at least through the end of the SSP performance \n18 \nperiod on September 30, 2026.  \n19 \n95.  Without SSP funds, there is likely to be an overall drop in the level of services \n20 \nprovided to noncitizen migrants in Washington; neither state or local governments or community \n21 \norganizations  are  likely  to  fill  the  $4,039,516  hole  left  by  Defendants’  termination  of \n22 \nWashington’s SSP grant. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  24  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

Moreover,  U.S.  Senator  Chris  Murphy,  Ranking  Member  of  the  Senate \n2 \nCommittee on Appropriations, has raised concerns that Defendants have not only impounded \n3 \nthe Shelter and Services funds but also used them “to fund other things, like ICE.”18 \n4 \n97.  Public  reporting  suggests  that  Defendants  have  begun  reallocating  funds \n5 \nappropriated for other purposes to ICE, or otherwise intend to misappropriate Shelter and \n6 \nServices Program funds and use that money for other purposes, including their ongoing mass \n7 \ndeportation efforts.19 \n8 \nV.

Pursuant to that doctrine, the Constitution “grants the power of the purse to \n2 \nCongress, not the President.” City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1231 (first citing U.S. \n3 \nConst. art. I, §9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause), and then citing U.S. Const. art. I, §8, cl. 1 \n4 \n(Spending Clause)). The ability  to control federal spending is “[a]mong Congress’s most \n5 \nimportant authorities.” Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 505 (2023). The Appropriations Clause \n6 \nthus operates as a “bulwark of the Constitution’s separation of powers” and prevents the \n7 \nExecutive  from  “possess[ing]  an  unbounded  power  over  the  public  purse  of  the  nation.” \n8 \nU.S. Dep’t of Navy v. Fed. Lab. Rels. Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, \n9 \nJ.) (internal citations omitted).  \n10 \n102.  In addition, Congress also possesses exclusive power to legislate. Article I, \n11 \nSection 1 of the Constitution states that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested \n12 \nin  a  Congress  of  the  United  States,  which  shall  consist  of  a  Senate  and  [a]  House  of \n13 \nRepresentatives.” U.S. Const. art. I, §1; see Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 \n14 \n(1998) (“There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to \n15 \namend, or to repeal statutes.”). Accordingly, “[a]side from the power of veto, the President is \n16 \nwithout authority to thwart congressional will by canceling appropriations passed by Congress.” \n17 \nCity & Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1232. That means that “‘the President does not have \n18 \nunilateral authority to refuse to spend’” funds that have been lawfully appropriated by Congress \n19 \nor  to  “‘decline  to  follow  a  statutory  mandate  or  prohibition  simply  because  of  policy \n20 \nobjections.’” Id. (quoting In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013)). \n21 \n103.  The Constitution further delineates the division of responsibilities between the \n22 \nLegislative and Executive Branches by specifying that the Executive must “take Care that the \n23 \nLaws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3; see Util. Air Regul. Grp. v.

See In re United Mine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 F.3d 545, \n4 \n551 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[T]he President is without authority to set aside congressional legislation \n5 \nby executive order . . . .”); Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838) (rejecting argument \n6 \nthat by charging the President with faithful execution of the laws, the Take Care clause “implies \n7 \na power to forbid their execution”); see also Util. Air. Reg. Grp., 573 U.S. at 327 (noting that \n8 \nthe President “act[s] at time through agencies”). \n9 \n104.  The federal courts have “not hesitated to enforce the principle of separation of \n10 \npowers embodied in the Constitution when its application has proved necessary for the decisions \n11 \nof cases or controversies properly before it.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 123 (1976). Thus, \n12 \n“whenever a separation-of-powers violation occurs, any aggrieved party with standing may file \n13 \na constitutional challenge.” Collins, 594 U.S. at 245. \n14 \n105.  Congress  created  the  Shelter  and  Services  Program  through  duly  enacted \n15 \nauthorizing legislation and appropriated funding under that program “to support sheltering and \n16 \nrelated activities provided by non-Federal entities . . . in support of relieving overcrowding in \n17 \nshort-term [CBP] holding facilities.” See Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 STAT. 4730; Pub. L. No. \n18 \n118-47, 138 STAT. 597, 598. Congress thus knowingly decided to spend money for the benefit \n19 \nof a group that was certain to include some who had entered into the United States without \n20 \ninspection and might ultimately be ordered removed from the country. Doing so, in Congress’ \n21 \njudgment, was desirable in order to achieve its objective of relieving overcrowding in DHS \n22 \ndetention facilities.  \n23 \n106.  Defendants may disagree with Congress’ policy choice but that does not entitle \n24 \nthem to ignore Congress’ clear funding command and their decision to terminate the Shelter and \n25 \nServices Program for that reason violates the Separation of Powers doctrine. \n26   \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  27  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

I, Sec. 8, cl. 1 \n3  107.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n4  the preceding paragraphs. \n5  108.  The Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress”—not the \n6  Executive—“shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the \n7  Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . .” \n8  U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1. \n9  109.  The Spending Clause requires any conditions on federal funds to be imposed \n10  “unambiguously,” Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981), so \n11  that States deciding whether to accept such funding can “exercise their choice knowingly, \n12  cognizant of the consequences of their participation,” South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 \n13  (1987). This is because “legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature \n14  of a contract,” where Congress’s authority “to legislate . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily \n15  and knowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’” Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17. Accordingly, \n16  Congress must provide States clear notice of the applicable funding conditions. See, e.g., \n17  Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).  \n18  110.  Nothing in the Shelter and Services Program authorizing legislation, or anywhere \n19  else in the U.S. Code, allows Defendants to pause, withhold, or terminate grants made under that \n20  program simply because they dislike the program and find that it conflicts with their current \n21  policy preferences or priorities. See Termination Notice at 1 (citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2)). \n22  And, within the  confines  of  the  Spending  Clause,  no statute  could  empower agencies to \n23  administer grant funds in such an arbitrary fashion. Washington would not have applied for or \n24  accepted SSP funds—with all the recordkeeping and other administrative burdens acceptance \n25  entails—had it understood that Defendants might decide, midstream, to terminate the grant \n26  because providing shelter and other services to noncitizen migrants was no longer an agency \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  28  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

Defendants’ actions to pause, withhold, and terminate Washington’s SSP grant \n5 \nbased only on a change in agency priorities violates the Spending Clause. \n6 \nCOUNT III \n7  Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(A) \nArbitrary and Capricious \n8 \n112.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n9 \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n10 \n113.  Defendants are “agencies” under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 \n11 \nU.S.C. § 551(1), and their decision to pause, withhold, and eventually terminate Washington’s \n12 \nSSP grant constitutes “[a]gency action made [judicially] reviewable by statute and final agency \n13 \naction for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id. § 704; see Bennett v. Spear, \n14 \n520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997). \n15 \n114.  Under the APA, a “court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, \n16 \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n17 \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n18 \n115.  An agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it is not “reasonable and reasonably \n19 \nexplained.” Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). \n20 \nAn agency fails to meet that standard if it “relied on factors which Congress has not intended it \n21 \nto consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation \n22 \nfor its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it \n23 \ncould not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle \n24 \nMfrs.

Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 32 of 215\n \n1 \nthe “serious reliance interests” that may have attached to the prior policy, and provide a \n2 \n“reasoned explanation” if it is “disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were \n3 \nengendered by the prior policy.” F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515-16 \n4 \n(2009). Finally, courts must set aside agency actions as arbitrary and capricious where, “viewing \n5 \nthe  evidence  as  a  whole,”  there  is  “a  significant  mismatch  between  the  decision the \n6 \n[agency] made and the rationale [it] provided.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 783 \n7 \n(2019). “Accepting contrived reasons” of that sort “would defeat the purpose of the enterprise” \n8 \nand convert judicial review into “an empty ritual.” Id. at 785. \n9 \n116.  Defendants’  actions  pausing,  withholding,  and  terminating  the  Shelter  and \n10 \nServices Program and Washington’s SSP grant are arbitrary and capricious for myriad reasons.   \n11 \n117.  To start, on January 28, Secretary Noem announced a policy that funds under the \n12 \nShelter and Services Program should be withheld, even as she instructed DHS component and \n13 \noffice heads to undertake a review of funding programs. But, instead of merely withholding SSP \n14 \nfunds, Defendants zeroed out all SSP funds on February 10 without notice or explanation. They \n15 \nthen proceeded to undertake a sham process—asserting a need, based on vague reference to \n16 \nunspecified “concerns,” to investigate whether Washington had used SSP funds for illegal \n17 \npurposes, despite knowing that Washington had not drawn a single dollar from its SSP grant \n18 \nand, more importantly, that Defendants had recently reduced the available funds to zero. Less \n19 \nthan a month later, however, Defendants terminated Washington’s SSP grant without even \n20 \nbriefly mentioning the “concerns” about SSP grants being used to fund illegal activities. Instead, \n21 \nDefendants stated simply that they were terminating Washington’s SSP grant because of their \n22 \npolicy-based objection to “provid[ing] support for illegal aliens.” Termination Notice at 1.  \n23 \n118.  Defendants’ explanations for their actions, if an explanation was offered at all, \n24 \nwere contrived, pretextual, and fail to consider that Congress specifically authorized and funded \n25 \nthe Shelter and Services Program to “reliev[e] overcrowding in [CBP’s] short-term holding \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  30  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

See Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 STAT. 597, 598. Ignoring that clear statutory \n3 \npurpose, Defendants’ actions were taken for the purpose of depriving disfavored groups of \n4 \nfederal  support,  including  noncitizen  migrants,  nonprofit  organizations,  and  jurisdictions \n5 \ndeemed to be so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Defendants thus “relied on factors which \n6 \nCongress has not intended it to consider[.]” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. at 43. \n7 \n119.  Defendants have thus fallen well short of the APA’s requirement that agency \n8 \nactions be “reasonable and reasonably explained.” Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. \n9 \n120.  Defendants’  actions  also  run  afoul  of  the  regulations  governing  their \n10 \nadministration  of  federal  awards,  including  because  they:  (1)  failed  to  provide  notice  to \n11 \nWashington before zeroing out its funding on February 10, 2 C.F.R. § 200.342; (2) imposed \n12 \nspecific conditions on Washington’s SSP award without explaining why those conditions were \n13 \nbeing imposed, id. § 200.208(2); and (3) terminated Washington’s SSP grant without allowing \n14 \nWashington time to satisfy the specific conditions, appeal the withholding decision, or actually \n15 \ndetermine  that  the  specific  conditions  were  insufficient  to  remedy  Washington’s  alleged \n16 \nnoncompliance, see id. § 200.339.  \n17 \n121.  Defendants’ failure to comply with binding regulations renders their conduct \n18 \narbitrary and capricious. See Erie Boulevard Hydropower, LP v. FERC, 878 F.3d 258, 269 (D.C. \n19 \nCir. 2017) (“[I]f an agency action fails to comply with its regulations, that action may be set \n20 \naside as arbitrary and capricious.”). \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  31  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 34 of 215\n \n1  COUNT IV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C) \n2  Contrary to Law \n3  122.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n4  the preceding paragraphs. \n5  123.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency  action, \n6  findings,  and  conclusions  found  to  be  .  .  .  not  in  accordance  with  law; . . . contrary  to \n7  constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n8  authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C).   \n9  124.  The Shelter and Services Program was created by Congress in order “to support \n10  sheltering and related activities provided by non-Federal entities . . . in support of relieving \n11  overcrowding in short-term [CBP] holding facilities.” See Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 STAT. 597, \n12  598. Thus, by design, the Shelter and Services Program was created to provide financial support \n13  to non-Federal entities, like Washington and its intended subrecipient partners, as reimbursement \n14  for the cost of providing emergency shelter and related services to noncitizen migrants following \n15  their release into the community by DHS. Congress thus made a conscious choice to provide \n16  funds in a manner that would benefit some individuals who may have entered into the United \n17  States unlawfully because doing so was necessary to achieve its goal of “relieving overcrowding \n18  in short-term [CBP] holding facilities.” Id. \n19  125.  Defendants openly engaged in actions meant to contravene the clear purpose of \n20  the Shelter and Services Program and, in turn, violated the Constitution’s Separation of Powers \n21  principle and usurped Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause. Finally, they attempt to \n22  justify their actions by misconstruing a regulation an Office of Management and Budget \n23  regulation, 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(2), that does not, and could not, permit their straightforward \n24  effort to undermine a duly enacted grant program they do not like.  \n25  126.  Accordingly, they have acted contrary to law and in excess of their statutory \n26  authority and their actions should be set aside. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.     Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 35 of 215\n \n1  COUNT V \nUltra Vires \n2 \n127.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n3 \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n4 \n128.  An executive agency “has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers \n5 \npower upon it.” Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986); see also \n6 \nNat’l Fed. Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022) (“Administrative agencies \n7 \nare  creatures  of  statute.  They  accordingly  possess  only  the  authority  that  Congress  has \n8 \nprovided.”). \n9 \n129.  Defendants may  exercise only that authority which is conferred by statute. \n10 \nSee City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013) (federal agencies’ “power to act and \n11 \nhow they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, \n12 \nno less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires”). \n13 \n130.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \n14 \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \n15 \nU.S. 320, 326-27 (2015). Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed equitable relief \n16 \nagainst federal officials who act “beyond th[e] limitations” imposed by federal statute. Larson v. \n17 \nDomestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949).  \n18 \n131.  Because Defendants paused, withheld, and terminated Washington’s SSP funds \n19 \nfor reasons that directly conflict with the very purpose for which those funds were authorized \n20 \nand appropriated, they acted in excess of their statutory authorization to administer Washington’s \n21 \nSSP grant. \n22 \n132.  Defendants’ ultra vires actions have caused and will continue to cause ongoing, \n23 \nirreparable harm to Plaintiff States for which there is no adequate remedy at law. \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND  33  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCivil Rights Division \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2000 \nNO.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n2  WHEREFORE, Washington prays that this Court: \n3  133.  Declare that Defendants’ decision to pause, withhold, or terminate Washington’s \n4  Shelter and Services grant funds was unlawful because it: (a) arrogates Congress’ power to \n5  control federal spending in violation of the Separation of Powers doctrine; (b) rests on an \n6  assertion of unfettered authority to terminate grants, in violation of the Spending Clause; \n7  (c) constitutes  arbitrary  and  capricious  agency  decision-making,  in  violation  of  the  APA; \n8  (d) contravenes multiple sources of binding law, in violation of the APA; and (e) is ultra vires.  \n9  134.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants to rescind any and all decisions \n10  to pause, withhold, or terminate Washington’s SSP grant; \n11  135.  Vacate and set aside Defendants’ decisions to pause, withhold, or terminate \n12  Washington’s SSP grant; \n13  136.  Retain  jurisdiction  to  monitor  Defendants’  compliance  with  this  Court’s \n14  judgment; \n15  137.  Award the Plaintiff States their reasonable fees, costs, and expenses, including \n16  attorneys’ fees; and  \n17  138.

Overview \nAs directed by Congress, SSP makes federal funds available to enable non-federal entities to \noff-set allowable costs incurred for services associated with noncitizen migrants recently \nencountered and released by DHS.1 As stated in the FY 2024 appropriation, the primary \npurpose of SSP is to “reliev[e] overcrowding in short-term holding facilities of [CBP].” \nRecipients of SSP may also seek grant funds for renovations or costs associated with \n \n \n1 The term Encounter as used in this announcement means: An encounter is an apprehension by a U.S. Border \nPatrol (Title 8) Agent or a determination of inadmissibility by a CBP Officer at a Port of Entry (Title 8). \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 44 of 215\n6                                                                                                                           \nmodifications to existing facilities in support of individuals who have recently been released \nfrom the custody of CBP. Refer to Appendix A of the NOFO for allowable activities. \n  \nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has committed to bolstering the capacity of \nnon-federal entities to receive noncitizens after they have been processed by U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection (CBP) and released from a DHS facility. DHS is committed to \nensuring appropriate coordination with and support for state, local, and community leaders to \nhelp mitigate increased impacts to their communities as outlined in the DHS Plan for \nSouthwest Border Security and Preparedness, issued on April 26, 2022, and updated on \nDecember 13, 2022. \n \nThe FY 2024 appropriation provided $650 million for SSP, including FEMA administrative \ncosts. This NOFO announces $340.9 million to be distributed through a competitive \napplication process, as described below.  The second FY 2024 SSP NOFO, distributing $275 \nmillion in funds through an allocated methodology, will be announced separately. \n \n \nb.  Goals, Objectives, and Priorities \nThe goal of SSP is the safe, orderly, and humane release of noncitizen migrants from DHS \nshort-term holding facilities.  \n \nThe objectives are: \n•  To provide funding to non-federal entities that serve noncitizen migrants recently \nreleased from DHS custody to temporarily provide shelter, food, transportation, acute \nmedical care, personal hygiene supplies, and labor necessary to provide these services; \nand,  \n•  To provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to temporarily shelter \nnoncitizen migrants recently released from DHS custody, including renovations and \nmodifications to existing facilities. \n \nc.  Alignment to Program Purpose and the DHS and FEMA Strategic Plan  \nSSP supports the FY 2020–2024 DHS Strategic Plan, Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and \nResilience, Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness, and the 2022-2026 \nFEMA Strategic Plan Goal 3: Promote and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation. \n \n11.

Apply for, update, or verify their Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the \nInternal Revenue Service;  \nb.  In the application, provide an UEI number; \nc.  Have an account with login.gov; \nd.  Register for, update, or verify their SAM account and UEI and ensure the account is \nactive before submitting the application; \ne.  Register in FEMA GO, add the organization to the system, and Authorized \nOrganization Representative (AOR). The organization’s electronic business point of \ncontact (EBiz POC) from the SAM registration may need to be involved in this step. \nFor step-by-step instructions, see the FEMA GO Startup Guide. \nf.  Submit the complete application in FEMA GO; and \ng.  Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times \nduring which it has an active federal award or an application or plan under \nconsideration by a federal awarding agency. As part of this, applicants must also \nprovide information on an applicant’s immediate and highest-level owner and \nsubsidiaries, as well as on all predecessors that have been awarded federal contracts \nor federal financial assistance within the last three years, if applicable. \n \nApplicants are advised that FEMA may not make a federal award until the applicant has \ncomplied with all applicable SAM requirements. Therefore, an applicant’s SAM registration \nmust be active not only at the time of application, but also during the application review \nperiod and when FEMA is ready to make a federal award. Further, as noted above, an \napplicant’s or recipient’s SAM registration must remain active for the duration of an active \nfederal award. If an applicant’s SAM registration is expired at the time of application, expires \nduring application review, or expires any other time before award, FEMA may determine \nthat the applicant is not qualified to receive a federal award and use that determination as a \nbasis for making a federal award to another applicant.  \n \nPer 2 C.F.R. § 25.110(c)(2)(iii), if an applicant is experiencing exigent circumstances that \nprevents it from obtaining an UEI number and completing SAM registration prior to \nreceiving a federal award, the applicant must notify FEMA as soon as possible by contacting \nfema-grants-news@fema.dhs.gov and providing the details of the circumstances that prevent \ncompletion of these requirements. If FEMA determines that there are exigent circumstances \nand FEMA has decided to make an award, the applicant will be required to obtain an UEI \nnumber, if applicable, and complete SAM registration within 30 days of the federal award \ndate.  \n \nFurther, following acceptance of a federal award, a recipient’s SAM registration must remain \nactive for the duration of the award. If a recipient’s SAM registration expires during the \nfederal award period of performance, FEMA may impose one or more remedy for \nnoncompliance (see 2 C.F.R. § 200.339), which could include terminating the federal award. \n \n6.  Electronic Delivery \nDHS is participating in the Grants.gov initiative to provide the grant community with a single \nsite to find and apply for grant funding opportunities. DHS encourages or requires applicants \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 50 of 215\n12                                                                                                                           \nto submit their applications online through Grants.gov, depending on the funding \nopportunity.  \nFor this funding opportunity, FEMA requires applicants to submit applications through \nFEMA GO. \n \n7.  How to Register to Apply \na.  General Instructions:  \nRegistering and applying for an award under this program is a multi-step process and \nrequires time to complete. Read the instructions below about registering to apply for FEMA \nfunds. Applicants should read the registration instructions carefully and prepare the \ninformation requested before beginning the registration process. Reviewing and assembling \nthe required information before beginning the registration process will alleviate last-minute \nsearches for required information. \n \nThe registration process can take up to four weeks to complete. To ensure an application \nmeets the deadline, applicants are advised to start the required steps well in advance of their \nsubmission. \nOrganizations must have an UEI number, an EIN, and an active SAM registration to apply \nfor a federal award under this funding opportunity. \nb.  Obtain an UEI Number:  \nAll entities applying for funding, including renewal funding, must have a UEI number. \nApplicants must enter the UEI number in the applicable data entry field on the SF-424 form. \n \nFor more detailed instructions for obtaining a UEI number, refer to: SAM.gov. \nc.  Obtain Employer Identification Number: \nAll entities applying for funding must provide an Employer Identification Number (EIN). \nThe EIN can be obtained from the IRS by visiting: Apply for an Employer Identification \nNumber (EIN) Online. \n \nd.  Create a login.gov Account:  \nApplicants must have a login.gov account in order to register with SAM or update their SAM \nregistration. Applicants can create a login.gov account by visiting: login.gov.  \n \nApplicants only have to create a login.gov account once. For applicants that are existing \nSAM users, use the same email address for the login.gov account as with SAM.gov so that \nthe two accounts can be linked. \n \nFor more information on the login.gov requirements for SAM registration, refer to: \nSAM.gov.  \n  \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 51 of 215\n13                                                                                                                           \ne.  Register with SAM:  \nAll applicants applying online through FEMA GO must register with SAM. Failure to \nregister with SAM will prevent an applicant from completing the application in FEMA GO. \nSAM registration must be renewed annually. Organizations will be issued a UEI number with \nthe completed SAM registration. \nFor more detailed instructions for registering with SAM, refer to Step 2: Register with SAM. \n \nNote: Per 2 C.F.R. § 25.200, applicants must also provide the applicant’s immediate and \nhighest-level owner, subsidiaries, and predecessors that have been awarded federal contracts \nor federal financial assistance within the last three years, if applicable. \n \nI.  ADDITIONAL SAM REMINDERS \nExisting SAM.gov account holders should check their account to make sure it is “ACTIVE.” \nSAM registration should be completed at the very beginning of the application period and \nshould be renewed annually to avoid being “INACTIVE.” Please allow plenty of time \nbefore the grant application submission deadline to obtain an UEI number and then to \nregister in SAM. It may be four weeks or more after an applicant submits the SAM \nregistration before the registration is active in SAM, and then it may be an additional \n24 hours before FEMA’s system recognizes the information. \n \nIt is imperative that the information applicants provide is correct and current. Please ensure \nthat your organization’s name, address, and EIN are up to date in SAM and that the UEI \nnumber used in SAM is the same one used to apply for all other FEMA awards. Payment \nunder any FEMA award is contingent on the recipient’s having a current SAM registration. \n \nII.  HELP WITH SAM \nThe SAM quick start guide for new recipient registration and SAM video tutorial for new \napplicants are tools created by the General Services Administration (GSA) to assist those \nregistering with SAM. If applicants have questions or concerns about a SAM registration, \nplease contact the Federal Service Desk at https://www.fsd.gov/gsafsd sp or call toll free \n(866) 606-8220. \n \nf.  Register in FEMA GO, Add the Organization to the System, and Establish the AOR:  \nApplicants must register in FEMA GO and add their organization to the system. The \norganization’s electronic business point of contact (EBiz POC) from the SAM registration \nmay need to be involved in this step. For step-by-step instructions, see FEMA GO Startup \nGuide. \n \nNote: FEMA GO will support only the most recent major release of the following browsers: \n•  Google Chrome \n•  Internet Explorer \n•  Mozilla Firefox \n•  Apple Safari \n•  Microsoft Edge \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 52 of 215\n14                                                                                                                           \nUsers who attempt to use tablet type devices or other browsers may encounter issues with \nusing FEMA GO. \n \n8.

Funding Restrictions and Allowable Costs \nFederal funds made available through this award may be used for the purpose set forth in this \nNOFO and the terms and conditions of the award and must be consistent with the statutory \nauthority for the award. Award funds may not be used for matching funds for any other \nfederal awards, lobbying, or intervention in federal regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings. In \naddition, federal funds may not be used to sue the Federal Government or any other \ngovernment entity.  \n \nAll costs charged to federal awards (including both federal funding and any non-federal \nmatching or cost sharing funds) must comply with applicable statutes, rules and regulations, \nand policies, this NOFO, and the terms and conditions of the federal award. They must also \ncomply with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit \nRequirements at 2 C.F.R. Part 200 unless otherwise indicated in the NOFO or the terms and \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 55 of 215\n17                                                                                                                           \nconditions of the federal award. This includes, among other requirements, that costs must be \nincurred, and products and services must be delivered within the budget period. See 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.403(h) (referring to budget periods, which for FEMA awards under this program is the \nsame as the period of performance). \n \nThe following identifies a list of activities for which a recipient may not use federal funds \nand any cost sharing or matching funds under federal awards:  \n•  Matching or cost sharing requirements for other federal grants and cooperative \nagreements (see 2 C.F.R. § 200.306)  \n•  Lobbying or other prohibited activities under 18 U.S.C. § 1913 or 2 C.F.R. § 200.450  \n•  Prosecuting claims against the federal government or any other government entity \n(see 2 C.F.R. § 200.435) See subsections below for information on any other funding \nrestrictions. \n \nSSP funds may not be used for costs associated with new construction or to purchase real \nestate.  \n \nCosts associated with renovations or modifications to existing facilities may not exceed \n$250,000.00 for the entire application budget. All activities and programs funded by FEMA, \nincluding grant-funded projects, must comply with federal Environmental and Historic \nPreservation laws, Executive Orders, regulations, and policies, as applicable. See Section \nF.3.c. Environmental Planning and Historic Preservation Compliance. \n \na.  Prohibitions on Expending FEMA Award Funds for Covered Telecommunications \nEquipment or Services  \nRecipients, subrecipients, and their contractors must comply with the prohibitions set forth in \nSection 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, \nPub. L. No. 115-232 (2018) (FY 2019 NDAA) and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.216, 200.327, 200.471, \nand Appendix II to 2 C.F.R. Part 200. The FY 2019 NDAA and these regulations, as they \napply to recipients, subrecipients, and their contractors and subcontractors, provide for two \ndistinct prohibitions: (1) prevent the use of federal award funds to procure or obtain covered \ntelecommunications equipment or services; and (2) prevent the use of federal award funds to \ncontract with an entity that uses such covered telecommunications equipment or services. \nGuidance is available at FEMA Policy #405-143-1 - Prohibitions on Expending FEMA \nAward Funds for Covered Telecommunications Equipment or Services \n \nAdditional guidance is available at Contract Provisions Guide: Navigating Appendix II to \nPart 200 - Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards \n(fema.gov). \nFEMA recipients and subrecipients may not use any FEMA funds under open or new awards \nto:  \n•  Procure or obtain any equipment, system, or service that uses covered \ntelecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of \nany system, or as critical technology of any system; \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 56 of 215\n18                                                                                                                           \n•  Enter into, extend, or renew a contract to procure or obtain any equipment, system, or \nservice that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial \nor essential component of any system, or as critical technology of any system; or \n•  Enter into, extend, or renew contracts with entities that use covered \ntelecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of \nany system, or as critical technology as part of any system. \n \nI.  REPLACEMENT EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES \nFEMA grant funding may be permitted to procure replacement equipment and services \nimpacted by this prohibition, provided the costs are otherwise consistent with the \nrequirements of the NOFO. \n \nII.  DEFINITIONS \nPer section 889(f)(2)-(3) of the FY 2019 NDAA and 2 C.F.R. § 200.216, covered \ntelecommunications equipment or services means: \ni.  Telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company or \nZTE Corporation, (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities); \nii.  For the purpose of public safety, security of Government facilities, physical \nsecurity surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security \npurposes, video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by \nHytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology \nCompany, or Dahua Technology Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such \nentities); \niii.  Telecommunications or video surveillance services provided by such entities or \nusing such equipment; or \niv.  Telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or \nprovided by an entity that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \nDirector of National Intelligence or the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, reasonably believes to be an entity owned or controlled by, or \notherwise connected to, the People’s Republic of China. \n \nExamples of the types of products covered by this prohibition include phones, internet, \nvideo surveillance, and cloud servers when produced, provided, or used by the entities listed \nin the definition of “covered telecommunications equipment or services.” See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.471. \n \nb.  Pre-Award Costs \nPre-award costs are costs incurred prior to the effective date of the federal award or \nsubaward. Pre-award costs are allowable only with the prior written approval of DHS/FEMA \nand if they are included in the award agreement. To request pre-award costs, applicants must \ninclude the costs with their application. The application must outline what the pre-award \ncosts are for and include a detailed budget break-out of all costs included in the funding \nrequest. \n \nThe pre-award cost must meet the requirements of 2 C.F.R Part 200.458, which provides that \nthe cost must be necessary for efficient and timely performance of the grant’s scope of work. \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 57 of 215\n19                                                                                                                           \nFEMA reserves the right to re-evaluate and disallow pre-award costs at time of award \nmonitoring if it is later determined that the services were not properly procured or do not \nsatisfy the requirements of 2 C.F.R Part 200.458. \n \nc.  Management and Administration (M&A) Costs   \nRecipients may expend up to 5% of an SSP award for allowable M&A costs. Subrecipients \nmay also expend up to 5% of their SSP subaward for allowable M&A costs. These may \ninclude services providing grants management, including grant application preparation. \nThese may also include recordkeeping (e.g., IT assistance (contracts and external support) \nand costs associated with creating a database and/or tracking system to assist with managing \nSSP funds as well as cybersecurity assessments and enhancements), etc. \n \nd.  Indirect Facilities & Administrative (F&A) Costs  \nIndirect costs are allowable under this program as described in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, including 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.414. Indirect (F&A) costs (IDC) mean those costs incurred for a common or \njoint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective and not readily assignable to the cost \nobjectives specifically benefitted, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. \nIDCs are allowable by the recipient [and subrecipients] as described in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, \nincluding 2 C.F.R. § 200.414. Applicants with a current negotiated IDC rate agreement who \ndesire to charge indirect costs to a federal award must provide a copy of their IDC rate \nagreement with their applications. Not all applicants are required to have a current negotiated \nIDC rate agreement. Applicants that are not required to have a negotiated IDC rate agreement \nbut are required to develop an IDC rate proposal must provide a copy of their proposal with \ntheir applications. Applicants who do not have a current negotiated IDC rate agreement \n(including a provisional rate) and wish to charge the de minimis rate must reach out to \nFEMA for further instructions. Applicants who wish to use a cost allocation plan in lieu of an \nIDC rate proposal must reach out to the FEMA Point of Contact for further instructions. As it \nrelates to the IDC for subrecipients, a recipient must follow the requirements of 2 C.F.R. §§ \n200.332 and 200.414 in approving the IDC rate for subawards. \n \nFor information on procedures for establishing indirect cost rates, see FEMA’s Preparedness \nGrants Manual. \n \ne.  Evaluation Costs \nEvaluation costs are allowable.  \n \nf.  Other Direct Costs  \nRefer to Appendix A for a description of eligible activities. \nE.  Application Review Information \n1.  Application Evaluation Criteria \na.  Programmatic Criteria \nThe evaluation criteria and weights for the pre-scoring process are listed in the table below. \nThe weights listed out per criteria indicate the maximum quantity an applicant can get for \neach criterion. For example, under Criteria 1, an applicant would receive the entire value \n(10% Weight) if the entirety (100%) of the applicant’s humanitarian services budget goes \ndirectly to serving noncitizen migrants. \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 58 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 59 of 215\n21                                                                                                                           \n100  4.  If the organization currently (within the last 30 days) provides  20% \nservices to noncitizen migrants immediately (the same calendar day \nor no later than the following calendar day) after their release from \nDHS custody. \n•  Yes, direct services = 100 points \n•  Yes, indirect services = 50 points \n•  No = 0 points \n \nDirect services are defined as firsthand engagement with NCMs for \nthe explicit purpose of serving food or providing shelter, water, \nmedical care, or transportation. \n  \nIndirect services include any activities supporting a direct service \nprovider, such as furnishing services or goods to direct service \nproviders (e.g., delivering food items). \n100  5.  Location of shelter and service facility(ies). Location is defined as  35% \nwhere the entity is primarily providing services, not where the entity \nis headquartered. \n  \nPoints will be assigned on a standard scale using CBP-provided \nmigrant release location and migrant destination location data from \nthe preceding twelve months. This criterion is intended to ensure \nreasonable balance across border and interior service providers in \nresponse to current operational demands and the weight between \nborder and interior localities will be set to achieve this balance. \n \nBonus Points \nEligible applications will be awarded two (2) bonus points for each eligible subapplicant \nincluded in the SSP-C application worksheet (maximum 10 possible points). \n \nFEMA and CBP will rank all complete applications based on how well they match the \nevaluation criteria. Answers to the application’s activity-specific questions provide \ninformation used to determine each application’s ranking relative to the program priorities. \nDuring the Technical Evaluation Process (see Section E.3.b.2), FEMA and CBP will review \napplications in a competitive range based on the evaluation criteria to ensure eligibility and \ncompliance with all application requirements provided in this NOFO as well as apply the \nfollowing programmatic criteria: \n•  Activities proposed are only those identified as allowable in this NOFO. \n•  The applicant demonstrates their capacity, either organically or through a partnership, \nto provide each SSP allowable activity proposed for funding. \n•  Proposed deliverables are consistent with the objectives and priorities of SSP.  \n•  Project timelines are realistic, attainable, and conform to the performance period of \nSSP. \n•  Proposed costs are allowable, reasonable, and cost-effective in relation to proposed \nactivities. \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 60 of 215\n22                                                                                                                           \n•  The applicant possesses the organic capacity to manage a federal award consistent \nwith Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. \n \nb.  Financial Integrity Criteria \nPrior to making a federal award, FEMA is required by 31 U.S.C. § 3354, as enacted by the \nPayment Integrity Information Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 116-117 (2020); 41 U.S.C. § 2313; \nand 2 C.F.R. § 200.206 to review information available through any Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB)-designated repositories of governmentwide eligibility qualification or \nfinancial integrity information, including whether SAM.gov identifies the applicant as being \nexcluded from receiving federal awards or is flagged for any integrity record submission.  \nFEMA may also pose additional questions to the applicant to aid in conducting the pre-award \nrisk review. Therefore, application evaluation criteria may include the following risk-based \nconsiderations of the applicant:  \ni.  Financial stability.  \nii.  Quality of management systems and ability to meet management standards. \niii. History of performance in managing federal award.  \niv. Reports and findings from audits. \nv.  Ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements. \n \nc.  Supplemental Financial Integrity Criteria and Review  \nPrior to making a federal award where the anticipated total federal share will be greater than \nthe simplified acquisition threshold, currently $250,000:  \n \nFEMA is required by 41 U.S.C. § 2313 and 2 C.F.R. § 200.206(a)(2) to review and \nconsider any information about the applicant, including information on the \napplicant’s immediate and highest-level owner, subsidiaries, and predecessors, if \napplicable, that is in the designated integrity and performance system accessible \nthrough the System for Award Management (SAM). \n \ni.  An applicant, at its option, may review information in FAPIIS and comment on \nany information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. \nii.  FEMA will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the other \ninformation in FAPIIS, in making a judgment about the applicant’s integrity, \nbusiness ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing \nthe review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 C.F.R. § 200.206. \n \n2.  Review and Selection Process \na.  Security Review \nThe DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis receives a list of potential SSP recipient \norganizations, which it reviews against U.S. intelligence community reporting. The security \nreview occurs after the competitive scoring and selection process is complete. The \ninformation provided for the security review is limited to the applicant’s name and physical \naddress. Any potentially derogatory information, as well as any potentially mitigating \ninformation, that could assist in determining whether a security risk exists, is sent to FEMA \nand is used in making award decisions. \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 61 of 215\n23                                                                                                                           \nb.  Subrecipient Process \nFor application packages that have subapplicants, the applicant must evaluate subapplicants \nbased on the eligibility criteria (Section C). As part of the review for SSP, the applicant must: \n•  Conduct a preliminary eligibility review. \n•  Confirm each subapplicant has the capacity to perform the SSP-allowable activities \nproposed in the Application Worksheet. \n•  Populate Tab 3 (Subapplicant Information) of the Application Worksheet for each \nproposed subapplicant. \nc.  Review and Selection Process \nSSP applications are reviewed through a multi-step process. All applications are pre-scored \nand ranked based on how well they align with the funding priorities and criteria outlined in \nthis NOFO. A Technical Evaluation panel will then develop a recommendation on which \nprojects, or portions of projects, to award based on the evaluation criteria (see Section E.1.a. \nProgrammatic Criteria). \n  \nd.  Pre-Scoring Process \nThe application undergoes a pre-scoring process based on the evaluation criteria. All \ninformation should comply with program requirements as stated in this NOFO and statutory \nfunding limitations. Applications will be ranked as a result of their evaluation criteria score. \n \ne.  Technical Evaluation Process \nFEMA will determine a competitive range based on application submissions and funding. \nApplications representing that competitive range will undergo a Technical Review by a panel \nof subject matter experts from CBP, FEMA, and other parts of DHS with experience in \nnoncitizen migration and grants management before being recommended for award. FEMA \nwill evaluate applications through a series of internal review processes for eligibility and \ncompleteness. Requests may be recommended for partial funding based on findings made \nduring this assessment. \n \nf.  Final Ranking of Applications \nOnce the Technical Evaluation Process is complete, a final ranking of applications will be \ncreated. The Technical Review Panel will use the final results to make funding \nrecommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security. All final funding determinations \nwill be made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who retains the discretion to consider \nother factors and information, such as indicators of the greatest need to provide services to \nthe greatest number of noncitizen migrants to decompress DHS facilities, in addition to the \nTechnical Review Panel’s funding recommendations.  \n \nF.  Federal Award Administration Information \n1.  Notice of Award \nBefore accepting the award, the AOR and recipient should carefully read the award package. \nThe award package includes instructions on administering the grant award and the terms and \nconditions associated with responsibilities under federal awards. Recipients must accept all \nconditions in this NOFO as well as any specific terms and conditions in the Notice of \nAward to receive an award under this program. \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 62 of 215\n24                                                                                                                           \n \nFEMA will provide the federal award package to the applicant electronically via FEMA GO. \nAward packages include an Award Letter, Summary Award Memo, Agreement Articles, and \nObligating Document. An email notification of the award package will be sent through \nFEMA’s grant application system to the AOR that submitted the application.  \n \nRecipients must accept their awards no later than 45 days from the award date. The recipient \nshall notify FEMA of its intent to accept and proceed with work under the award through the \nFEMA GO system.  \n \nFunds will remain on hold until the recipient accepts the award through the FEMA GO \nsystem and all other conditions of the award have been satisfied or until the award is \notherwise rescinded. Failure to accept a grant award within the specified timeframe may \nresult in a loss of funds. \n \n2.  Pass-Through Requirements  \nFEMA strongly encourages recipients to pass through funds to eligible subrecipients. See \nSection C.3. Subapplicant Eligibility Criteria. \n3.  Administrative and National Policy Requirements \nIn addition to the requirements of this section and in this NOFO, FEMA may place specific \nterms and conditions on individual awards in accordance with 2 C.F.R. Part 200. \n \na.  DHS Standard Terms and Conditions \nAll successful applicants for DHS grant and cooperative agreements are required to comply \nwith DHS Standard Terms and Conditions, which are available online at: DHS Standard \nTerms and Conditions. \n \nThe applicable DHS Standard Terms and Conditions will be those in effect at the time the \naward was made What terms and conditions will apply for the award will be clearly stated in \nthe award package at the time of award. \n \nb.  Ensuring the Protection of Civil Rights \nAs the Nation works towards achieving the National Preparedness Goal, it is important to \ncontinue to protect the civil rights of individuals. Recipients and subrecipients must carry out \ntheir programs and activities, including those related to the building, sustainment, and \ndelivery of core capabilities, in a manner that respects and ensures the protection of civil \nrights for protected populations.  \n \nFederal civil rights statutes, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title \nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, along with DHS and FEMA regulations, prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability, \nlimited English proficiency, or economic status in connection with programs and activities \nreceiving federal financial assistance from FEMA, as applicable.  \nThe DHS Standard Terms and Conditions include a fuller list of the civil rights provisions \nthat apply to recipients. These terms and conditions can be found in the DHS Standard Terms \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 63 of 215\n25                                                                                                                           \nand Conditions. Additional information on civil rights provisions is available at External \nCivil Rights Division webpage. \n \nMonitoring and oversight requirements in connection with recipient compliance with federal \ncivil rights laws are also authorized pursuant to 44 C.F.R. Part 7 or other applicable \nregulations. \n \nIn accordance with civil rights laws and regulations, recipients and subrecipients must ensure \nthe consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including \nindividuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment. \n \nc.  Environmental Planning and Historic Preservation (EHP) Compliance \nAs a federal agency, FEMA is required to consider the effects of its actions on the \nenvironment and historic properties to ensure that all activities and programs funded by \nFEMA, including grant-funded projects, comply with federal EHP laws, Executive Orders, \nregulations, and policies, as applicable.  \nRecipients and subrecipients proposing projects that have the potential to impact the \nenvironment, including, but not limited to, the construction of communication towers, \nmodification or renovation of existing buildings, structures, and facilities, or new \nconstruction including replacement of facilities, must participate in the FEMA EHP \nreview process. The EHP review process involves the submission of a detailed project \ndescription along with any supporting documentation requested by FEMA in order to \ndetermine whether the proposed project has the potential to impact environmental resources \nincluding, but not limited to, threatened or endangered species and historic properties; and \nidentify mitigation measures and/or alternative courses of action that may lessen any impact \nto those resources.  \n \nIn some cases, FEMA is also required to consult with other regulatory agencies and the \npublic in order to complete the review process. Federal law requires EHP review to be \ncompleted before federal funds are released to carry out proposed projects. FEMA may not \nbe able to fund projects that are not in compliance with applicable EHP laws, Executive \nOrders, regulations, and policies. FEMA may recommend mitigation measures and/or \nalternative courses of action to lessen any impact to environmental resources and bring the \nproject into compliance with EHP requirements.  \n \nGuidance on the EHP process is found at Environmental Planning and Historic Preservation. \nThe site contains links to various documents including those identifying agency EHP \nresponsibilities and program requirements, such as implementation of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act and other EHP laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. DHS and \nFEMA EHP policy is also found in the EHP Directive & Instruction.   \nAll FEMA actions, including grant-funded actions, must comply with National Flood \nInsurance Program criteria or any more restrictive federal, state, or local floodplain \nmanagement standards or building code (44 CFR § 9.11(d)(6)). \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 64 of 215\n26                                                                                                                           \nAll FEMA-funded non-critical actions in 1% annual chance floodplains (also known as 100-\nyear floodplains) that involve new construction or substantial improvement of structures \nmust be elevated, at a minimum, to the lower of: \n•  Two feet above the 1% annual chance flood elevation (also known as the base flood \nelevation), in accordance with the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard \n(FFRMS) “Freeboard Value Approach” (FVA); or \n \n•  The 0.2% annual chance flood elevation. Where 0.2% annual chance flood elevations \nare not available, such actions must be elevated to at least two feet above the 1% \nannual chance flood elevation. \nAll FEMA-funded critical actions in 0.2% annual chance floodplains (also known as 500-\nyear floodplains) that involve new construction or substantial improvement of structures \nmust be elevated, at a minimum, to the higher of: \n•  Three feet above the 1% annual chance flood elevation; or \n \n•  The 0.2% annual chance flood elevation. Where 0.2% annual chance flood elevations \nare not available, such actions must be elevated to at least three feet above the 1% \nannual chance flood elevation. \nSee Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, as amended by Executive Order \n13690, Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further \nSoliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input. \nIn some cases, FEMA is also required to consult with other regulatory agencies and the \npublic in order to complete the review process. Federal law requires EHP review to be \ncompleted before federal funds are released to carry out proposed projects. FEMA may not \nbe able to fund projects that are not in compliance with applicable EHP laws, Executive \nOrders, regulations, and policies. \nDHS and FEMA EHP policy is found in directives and instructions available on the \nFEMA.gov EHP page, the FEMA website page that includes documents regarding EHP \nresponsibilities and program requirements, including implementation of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act and other EHP regulations and Executive Orders. \nThe GPD EHP screening form is located on this FEMA Form. Additionally, all recipients \nunder this funding opportunity are required to comply with FEMA GPD EHP Policy \nGuidance, FEMA Policy #108-023-1. \nd.  Mandatory Disclosures \nThe non-federal entity or applicant for a Federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in \nwriting to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity all violations of Federal \ncriminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal \naward. (2CFR 200.113) \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 65 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 66 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 67 of 215\n29                                                                                                                           \nFFR. The record retention period may be longer, such as due to an audit or litigation, for \nequipment or real property used beyond the period of performance, or due to other \ncircumstances outlined in 2 C.F.R. § 200.334. \n  \nThe recipient is responsible for refunding to FEMA any balances of unobligated cash that \nFEMA paid that are not authorized to be retained per 2 C.F.R. § 200.344(d).  \n \nII.  ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSEOUT \nAdministrative closeout is a mechanism for FEMA to unilaterally move forward with closeout \nof an award using available award information in lieu of final reports from the recipient per 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.344(h)-(i). It is a last resort available to FEMA, and if FEMA needs to \nadministratively close an award, this may negatively impact a recipient’s ability to obtain \nfuture funding. This mechanism can also require FEMA to make cash or cost adjustments and \nineligible cost determinations based on the information it has, which may result in identifying \na debt owed to FEMA by the recipient. \n \nWhen a recipient is not responsive to FEMA’s reasonable efforts to collect required reports \nneeded to complete the standard closeout process, FEMA is required under 2 C.F.R. § \n200.344(h) to start the administrative closeout process within the regulatory timeframe. \nFEMA will make at least three written attempts to collect required reports before initiating \nadministrative closeout. If the recipient does not submit all required reports in accordance \nwith 2 C.F.R. § 200.344, this NOFO, and the terms and conditions of the award, FEMA must \nproceed to administratively close the award with the information available within one year of \nthe period of performance end date. Additionally, if the recipient does not submit all required \nreports within one year of the period of performance end date, per 2 C.F.R. § 200.344(i), \nFEMA must report in Contracting Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) the \nrecipient’s material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award. \n \nIf FEMA administratively closes an award where no final FFR has been submitted, FEMA \nuses that administrative closeout date in lieu of the final FFR submission date as the start of \nthe record retention period under 2 C.F.R. § 200.334.  \n \nIn addition, if an award is administratively closed, FEMA may decide to impose remedies for \nnoncompliance per 2 C.F.R. § 200.339, consider this information in reviewing future award \napplications, or apply special conditions to existing or future awards. \n \nd.  Additional Reporting Requirements \nI.  DISCLOSING INFORMATION PER 2 C.F.R. § 180.335 \nThis reporting requirement pertains to disclosing information related to government-wide \nsuspension and debarment requirements. Before a recipient enters into a grant award with \nFEMA, the recipient must notify FEMA if it knows if it or any of the recipient’s principals \nunder the award fall under one or more of the four criteria listed at 2 C.F.R. § 180.335: \ni.  Are presently excluded or disqualified; \nii.  Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of the offenses listed \nin 2 C.F.R. § 180.800(a) or had a civil judgment rendered against it or any of the \nrecipient’s principals for one of those offenses within that time period;  \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 68 of 215\n30                                                                                                                           \niii.  Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a \ngovernmental entity (federal, state or local) with commission of any of the \noffenses listed in 2 C.F.R. § 180.800(a); or  \niv.  Have had one or more public transactions (federal, state, or local) terminated \nwithin the preceding three years for cause or default.  \n \nAt any time after accepting the award, if the recipient learns that it or any of its principals \nfalls under one or more of the criteria listed at 2 C.F.R. § 180.335, the recipient must \nprovide immediate written notice to FEMA in accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 180.350. \n \nII.  REPORTING OF MATTERS RELATED TO RECIPIENT INTEGRITY AND PERFORMANCE  \nAppendix XII to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 sets forth a term and condition related to recipient \nintegrity and performance matters that will apply to all federal awards under this funding \nopportunity. If the total value of currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and \nprocurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies exceeds $10,000,000 for any \nperiod of time during the period of performance of a federal award under this funding \nopportunity, then a recipient must maintain the currency of information reported in the \nContracting Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) about civil, criminal, or \nadministrative proceedings described in paragraph 2 of Appendix XII at the reporting \nfrequency described in paragraph 4 of Appendix XII. \n \nIII. SINGLE AUDIT REPORT \nA recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient’s fiscal year in federal awards \n(as defined by 2 C.F.R. § 200.1) must have a single audit conducted in accordance with 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.514 except when it elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in \naccordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.501. The audit must be conducted in accordance with 2 \nC.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F and, as required by 2 C.F.R. § 200.514, in accordance with the \nU.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Generally Accepted Government Auditing \nStandards, which can be found on the Yellow Book page of the GAO website. \n \n5.  Monitoring and Oversight \nThe regulation at 2 C.F.R. § 200.337 provides DHS and any of its authorized representatives \nwith the right of access to any documents, papers, or other records of the recipient [and any \nsubrecipients] that are pertinent to a federal award in order to make audits, examinations, \nexcerpts, and transcripts. The right also includes timely and reasonable access to the \nrecipient’s or subrecipient’s personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to \nsuch documents. Pursuant to this right and per 2 C.F.R. § 200.329, DHS may conduct desk \nreviews and make site visits to review project accomplishments and management control \nsystems to evaluate project accomplishments and to provide any required technical \nassistance. During site visits, DHS may review a recipient’s or subrecipient’s files pertinent \nto the federal award and interview and/or discuss these files with the recipient’s or \nsubrecipient’s personnel. Recipients and subrecipients must respond in a timely and accurate \nmanner to DHS requests for information relating to a federal award. \n \nEffective monitoring and oversight help FEMA ensure that recipients use grant funds for \ntheir intended purpose(s); verify that projects undertaken are consistent with approved plans; \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 69 of 215\n31                                                                                                                           \nand ensure that recipients make adequate progress toward stated goals and objectives. \nAdditionally, monitoring serves as the primary mechanism to ensure that recipients comply \nwith applicable laws, rules, regulations, program guidance, and requirements. FEMA \nregularly monitors all grant programs both financially and programmatically in accordance \nwith federal laws, regulations (including 2 C.F.R. Part 200), program guidance, and the terms \nand conditions of the award. All monitoring efforts ultimately serve to evaluate progress \ntowards grant goals and proactively target and address issues that may threaten grant success \nduring the period of performance. \n \nFEMA staff will periodically monitor recipients to ensure that administrative processes, \npolicies and procedures, budgets, and other related award criteria are meeting Federal \nGovernment-wide and FEMA regulations. Aside from reviewing quarterly financial and \nprogrammatic reports, FEMA may also conduct enhanced monitoring through either desk-\nbased reviews, onsite monitoring visits, or both. Enhanced monitoring will involve the \nreview and analysis of the financial compliance and administrative processes, policies, \nactivities, and other attributes of each federal assistance award, and it will identify areas \nwhere the recipient may need technical assistance, corrective actions, or other support. \n \nFinancial and programmatic monitoring are complementary processes within FEMA’s \noverarching monitoring strategy that function together to ensure effective grants \nmanagement, accountability, and transparency; validate progress against grant and program \ngoals; and safeguard federal funds against fraud, waste, and abuse. Financial monitoring \nprimarily focuses on statutory and regulatory compliance with administrative grant \nrequirements, while programmatic monitoring seeks to validate and assist in grant progress, \ntargeting issues that may be hindering achievement of project goals and ensuring compliance \nwith the purpose of the grant and grant program. Both monitoring processes are similar in \nthat they feature initial reviews of all open awards, and additional, in-depth monitoring of \ngrants requiring additional attention. \n \nRecipients and subrecipients who are pass-through entities are responsible for monitoring \ntheir subrecipients in a manner consistent with the terms of the federal award at 2 C.F.R. Part \n200, including 2 C.F.R. § 200.332. This includes the pass-through entity’s responsibility to \nmonitor the activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for \nauthorized purposes, in compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and \nconditions of the subaward; and that subaward performance goals are achieved.  \n \nIn terms of overall award management, recipient and subrecipient responsibilities include, \nbut are not limited to: accounting of receipts and expenditures, cash management, \nmaintaining adequate financial records, reporting and refunding expenditures disallowed by \naudits, monitoring if acting as a pass-through entity, or other assessments and reviews, and \nensuring overall compliance with the terms and conditions of the award or subaward, as \napplicable, including the terms of 2 C.F.R. Part 200. \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 70 of 215\n32                                                                                                                           \nG.

Additional Information  \n1.  Termination Provisions \nFEMA may terminate a federal award in whole or in part for one of the following reasons. \nFEMA and the recipient must still comply with closeout requirements at 2 C.F.R. §§ \n200.344-200.345 even if an award is terminated in whole or in part. To the extent that \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 71 of 215\n33                                                                                                                           \nsubawards are permitted under this NOFO, pass-through entities should refer to 2 C.F.R. § \n200.340 for additional information on termination regarding subawards.  \n \na.  Noncompliance \nIf a recipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions of a federal award, FEMA may \nterminate the award in whole or in part. If the noncompliance can be corrected, FEMA may \nfirst attempt to direct the recipient to correct the noncompliance. This may take the form of a \nCompliance Notification. If the noncompliance cannot be corrected or the recipient is non-\nresponsive, FEMA may proceed with a Remedy Notification, which could impose a remedy \nfor noncompliance per 2 C.F.R. § 200.339, including termination. Any action to terminate \nbased on noncompliance will follow the requirements of 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.341-200.342 as \nwell as the requirement of 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(c) to report in FAPIIS the recipient’s material \nfailure to comply with the award terms and conditions. See also the section on Actions to \nAddress Noncompliance in this NOFO.  \n \nb.  With the Consent of the Recipient \nFEMA may also terminate an award in whole or in part with the consent of the recipient, in \nwhich case the parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective \ndate, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.  \n \nc.  Notification by the Recipient \nThe recipient may terminate the award, in whole or in part, by sending written notification to \nFEMA setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in the case of \npartial termination, the portion to be terminated. In the case of partial termination, FEMA \nmay determine that a partially terminated award will not accomplish the purpose of the \nfederal award, so FEMA may terminate the award in its entirety. If that occurs, FEMA will \nfollow the requirements of 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.341-200.342 in deciding to fully terminate the \naward.  \n \n2.  Program Evaluation \nFederal agencies are required to structure NOFOs that incorporate program evaluation \nactivities from the outset of their program design and implementation to meaningfully \ndocument and measure their progress towards meeting agency priority goal(s) and program \noutcomes. \nOMB Memorandum M-21-27, Evidence-Based Policymaking: Learning Agendas and \nAnnual Evaluation Plans, implementing Title I of the Foundations for Evidence-Based \nPolicymaking Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-435 (2019) (Evidence Act), urges federal \nawarding agencies to use program evaluation as a critical tool to learn, improve equitable \ndelivery, and elevate program service and delivery across the program lifecycle. Evaluation \nmeans “an assessment using systematic data collection and analysis of one or more programs, \npolicies, and organizations intended to assess their effectiveness and efficiency.” Evidence \nAct, § 101 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 311).  \nAs such, recipients and subrecipients are required to participate in a DHS-, Component-, or \nProgram Office-led evaluation if selected, which may be carried out by a third-party on \nbehalf of the DHS, its component agencies, or the Program Office. Such an evaluation may \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 72 of 215\n34                                                                                                                           \ninvolve information collections including but not limited to surveys, interviews, or \ndiscussions with individuals who benefit from the federal award program operating \npersonnel, and award recipients, as specified in a DHS-, component agency-, or Program \nOffice-approved evaluation plan. More details about evaluation requirements may be \nprovided in the federal award, if available at that time, or following the award as evaluation \nrequirements are finalized. Evaluation costs incurred during the period of performance are \nallowable costs (either as direct or indirect) Recipients and subrecipients are also encouraged, \nbut not required, to participate in any additional evaluations after the period of performance \nends, although any costs incurred to participate in such evaluations are not allowable and \nmay not be charged to the federal award.   \n3.  Period of Performance Extensions  \nExtensions to the period of performance (POP) for this program may be permitted only with \nprior written approval from FEMA. Recipients must request extensions prior to the \nexpiration of the POP. Extensions to the POP identified in the award will only be considered \nthrough formal, written requests to the recipient’s FEMA Program Analyst or other relevant \nFEMA position and must contain specific and compelling justifications as to why an \nextension is required. Recipients are advised to coordinate with the FEMA Program Analyst \nor other relevant FEMA position as needed when preparing an extension request.   \n \nAll extension requests must address the following: \na.  The grant program, fiscal year, and award number; \nb.  Reason for the delay –including details of the legal, policy, or operational challenges \nthat prevent the final outlay of awarded funds by the deadline; \nc.  Current status of the activity(ies); \nd.  Approved POP termination date and new project completion date; \ne.  Amount of funds drawn down to date; \nf.  Remaining available funds, both federal and, if applicable, non-federal; \ng.  Budget outlining how remaining federal and, if applicable, non-federal funds will be \nexpended; \nh.  Plan for completion, including milestones and timeframes for achieving each \nmilestone and the position or person responsible for implementing the plan for \ncompletion; and \ni.  Certification that the activity(ies) will be completed within the extended POP without \nany modification to the original statement of work and as approved by FEMA. \n \nExtension requests will be granted only due to compelling legal, policy, or operational \nchallenges. Extension requests will only be considered for the following reasons: \n•  Contractual commitments by the recipient or subrecipient with vendors prevent \ncompletion of the project, including delivery of equipment or services, within the \nexisting POP; \n•  The project must undergo a complex environmental review that cannot be completed \nwithin the existing POP; \n•  Projects are long-term by design, and therefore acceleration would compromise core \nprogrammatic goals; or \n•  Where other special or extenuating circumstances exist. \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 73 of 215\n35                                                                                                                           \n \nRecipients should submit all proposed extension requests to FEMA for review and approval \nat least 120 days prior to the end of the POP to allow sufficient processing time. Extensions \nmay be granted one time for up to 120 days. Extensions are typically granted for no more \nthan a six-month period. \n \n4.  Disability Integration \nPursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, recipients of FEMA financial \nassistance must ensure that their programs and activities do not discriminate against qualified \nindividuals with disabilities. \n \nGrant and cooperative agreement recipients should engage with the whole community to \nadvance individual and community preparedness and to work as a nation to build and sustain \nresilience. In doing so, recipients are encouraged to consider the needs of individuals with \ndisabilities into the activities and projects funded by the grant or cooperative agreement. \n \nFEMA expects that the integration of the needs of people with disabilities will occur at all \nlevels, including planning; alerting, notification, and public outreach; training; purchasing of \nequipment and supplies; protective action implementation; and exercises/drills. \n \nThe following are examples that demonstrate the integration of the needs of people with \ndisabilities in carrying out FEMA awards: \n•  Include representatives of organizations that work with/for people with disabilities on \nplanning committees, work groups and other bodies engaged in development and \nimplementation of the grant programs and activities. \n•  Hold all activities related to the grant in locations that are accessible to persons with \nphysical disabilities and intellectual disabilities to the extent practicable.  \n•  Provide auxiliary aids and services, including American Sign Language interpreters, \nthat provide public information across the community and in shelters. \n•  Ensure shelter-specific grant funds are in alignment with FEMA’s Guidance on \nPlanning for Integration of Functional Needs Support Services in General Population \nShelters. \n•  If making alterations to an existing building to a primary function area utilizing \nfederal funds, complying with the most recent codes and standards and making path \nof travel to the primary function area accessible to the greatest extent possible. \n•  Implement specific procedures used by public transportation agencies that include \nevacuation and passenger communication plans and measures for individuals with \ndisabilities. \n•  Identify, create, and deliver training to address any training gaps specifically aimed \ntoward whole-community preparedness. Include and interact with individuals with \ndisabilities, aligning with the designated program capability. \n•  Establish best practices in inclusive planning and preparedness that consider physical \naccess, needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities, and information access \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 74 of 215\n36                                                                                                                           \nFEMA grant recipients can fund projects towards the resiliency of the whole community, \nincluding people with disabilities, such as training, outreach and safety campaigns, provided \nthat the project aligns with this NOFO and the terms and conditions of the award. \n \n5.  Conflicts of Interest in the Administration of Federal Awards or Subawards \nFor conflicts of interest under grant-funded procurements and contracts, refer to the section \non Procurement Integrity in this NOFO and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.317 – 200.327.  \n \nTo eliminate and reduce the impact of conflicts of interest in the subaward process, recipients \nand pass-through entities must follow their own policies and procedures regarding the \nelimination or reduction of conflicts of interest when making subawards. Recipients and \npass-through entities are also required to follow any applicable federal and state, local, tribal, \nor territorial (SLTT) statutes or regulations governing conflicts of interest in the making of \nsubawards.  \n \nThe recipient or pass-through entity must disclose to the respective Program Analyst or \nProgram Manager, in writing, any real or potential conflict of interest that may arise during \nthe administration of the federal award, as defined by the federal or SLTT statutes or \nregulations or their own existing policies, within five days of learning of the conflict of \ninterest. Similarly, subrecipients, whether acting as subrecipients or as pass-through entities, \nmust disclose any real or potential conflict of interest to the recipient or next-level pass-\nthrough entity as required by the recipient or pass-through entity’s conflict of interest \npolicies, or any applicable federal or SLTT statutes or regulations. \n \nConflicts of interest may arise during the process of FEMA making a federal award in \nsituations where an employee, officer, or agent, any members of his or her immediate family, \nhis or her partner has a close personal relationship, a business relationship, or a professional \nrelationship, with an applicant, subapplicant, recipient, subrecipient, or FEMA employees. \n \n6.  Procurement Integrity \nThrough audits conducted by the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) and FEMA grant \nmonitoring, findings have shown that some FEMA recipients have not fully adhered to the \nproper procurement requirements at 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.317 – 200.327 when spending grant \nfunds. Anything less than full compliance with federal procurement requirements jeopardizes \nthe integrity of the grant as well as the grant program. To assist with determining whether an \naction is a procurement or instead a subaward, please consult 2 C.F.R. § 200.331. For \ndetailed guidance on the federal procurement standards, recipients and subrecipients should \nrefer to various materials issued by FEMA’s Procurement Disaster Assistance Team (PDAT), \nsuch as the PDAT Field Manual and Contract Provisions Guide. Additional resources, \nincluding an upcoming trainings schedule, can be found on the PDAT Website. \n \nThe below highlights the federal procurement requirements for FEMA recipients when \nprocuring goods and services with federal grant funds. FEMA will include a review of \nrecipients’ procurement practices as part of the normal monitoring activities. All \nprocurement activity must be conducted in accordance with federal procurement \nstandards at 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.317 – 200.327. Select requirements under these standards are \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 75 of 215\n37                                                                                                                           \nlisted below. The recipient and any of its subrecipients must comply with all requirements, \neven if they are not listed below. \n \nUnder 2 C.F.R. § 200.317, when procuring property and services under a federal award, \nstates (including territories) must follow the same policies and procedures they use for \nprocurements from their non-federal funds; additionally, states must now follow 2 C.F.R. § \n200.321 regarding socioeconomic steps, 200.322 regarding domestic preferences for \nprocurements, 200.323 regarding procurement of recovered materials, and 2 C.F.R. § \n200.327 regarding required contract provisions. \n \nAll other non-federal entities, such as tribes (collectively, non-state entities), must have and \nuse their own documented procurement procedures that reflect applicable SLTT laws and \nregulations, provided that the procurements conform to applicable federal law and the \nstandards identified in 2 C.F.R. Part 200. These standards include, but are not limited to, \nproviding for full and open competition consistent with the standards of 2 C.F.R. § 200.319 \nand the required procurement methods at § 200.320. \n \na.  Important Changes to Procurement Standards in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 \nStates are now required to follow the socioeconomic steps in soliciting small and minority \nbusinesses, women’s business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms per 2 C.F.R. § \n200.321. All non-federal entities should also, to the greatest extent practicable under a federal \naward, provide a preference for the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products, or \nmaterials produced in the United States per 2 C.F.R. § 200.322. More information on OMB’s \nrevisions to the federal procurement standards can be found in Purchasing Under a FEMA \nAward: OMB Revisions Fact Sheet. \n \nThe recognized procurement methods in 2 C.F.R. § 200.320 have been reorganized into \ninformal procurement methods, which include micro-purchases and small purchases; formal \nprocurement methods, which include sealed bidding and competitive proposals; and \nnoncompetitive procurements. The federal micro-purchase threshold is currently $10,000, \nand non-state entities may use a lower threshold when using micro-purchase procedures \nunder a FEMA award. If a non-state entity wants to use a micro-purchase threshold higher \nthan the federal threshold, it must follow the requirements of 2 C.F.R. § 200.320(a)(1)(iii)-\n(v). The federal simplified acquisition threshold is currently $250,000, and a non-state entity \nmay use a lower threshold but may not exceed the federal threshold when using small \npurchase procedures under a FEMA award. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.1 (citing the definition of \nsimplified acquisition threshold from 48 C.F.R. Part 2, Subpart 2.1).  \n \nSee 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.216, 200.471, and Appendix II as well as section D.13.a of the NOFO \nregarding prohibitions on covered telecommunications equipment or services. \n \nb.  Competition and Conflicts of Interest \nAmong the requirements of 2 C.F.R. § 200.319(b) applicable to all non-federal entities other \nthan states, in order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair \ncompetitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, \nstatements of work, or invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded from \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 76 of 215\n38                                                                                                                           \ncompeting for such procurements. FEMA considers these actions to be an organizational \nconflict of interest and interprets this restriction as applying to contractors that help a non-\nfederal entity develop its grant application, project plans, or project budget. This prohibition \nalso applies to the use of former employees to manage the grant or carry out a contract when \nthose former employees worked on such activities while they were employees of the non-\nfederal entity. \n \nUnder this prohibition, unless the non-federal entity solicits for and awards a contract \ncovering both development and execution of specifications (or similar elements as described \nabove), and this contract was procured in compliance with 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.317 – 200.327, \nfederal funds cannot be used to pay a contractor to carry out the work if that contractor also \nworked on the development of those specifications. This rule applies to all contracts funded \nwith federal grant funds, including pre-award costs, such as grant writer fees, as well as post-\naward costs, such as grant management fees. \n \nAdditionally, some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include, but \nare not limited to: \n•  Placing unreasonable requirements on firms for them to qualify to do business; \n•  Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding; \n•  Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies; \n•  Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts; \n•  Organizational conflicts of interest; \n•  Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to \nbe offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the \nprocurement; and \n•  Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. \n \nPer 2 C.F.R. § 200.319(c), non-federal entities other than states must conduct procurements \nin a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed SLTT \ngeographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where \napplicable federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in \nthis section preempts state licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering \nservices, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an \nappropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for \nthe contract. \n \nUnder 2 C.F.R. § 200.318(c)(1), non-federal entities other than states are required to maintain \nwritten standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the actions of their \nemployees engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts. No employee, \nofficer, or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract \nsupported by a federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. \nSuch conflicts of interest would arise when the employee, officer or agent, any member of \nhis or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization that employs or is about to \nemploy any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible \npersonal benefit from a firm considered for a contract. The officers, employees, and agents of \nthe non-federal entity may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 77 of 215\n39                                                                                                                           \nmonetary value from contractors or parties to subcontracts. However, non-federal entities \nmay set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial, or the gift is \nan unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct must provide for disciplinary \nactions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the \nnon-federal entity.  \n \nUnder 2 C.F.R. 200.318(c)(2), if the recipient or subrecipient (other than states) has a parent, \naffiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a state, local, tribal, or territorial government, \nthe non-federal entity must also maintain written standards of conduct covering \norganizational conflicts of interest. In this context, organizational conflict of interest means \nthat because of a relationship with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the \nnon-federal entity is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a \nprocurement action involving a related organization. The non-federal entity must disclose in \nwriting any potential conflicts of interest to FEMA or the pass-through entity in accordance \nwith applicable FEMA policy. \n \nc.  Supply Schedules and Purchasing Programs \nGenerally, a non-federal entity may seek to procure goods or services from a federal supply \nschedule, state supply schedule, or group purchasing agreement. \n \nI.  GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULES \nStates, tribes, and local governments, and any instrumentality thereof (such as local \neducation agencies or institutions of higher education) may procure goods and services from \na General Services Administration (GSA) schedule. GSA offers multiple efficient and \neffective procurement programs for state, tribal, and local governments, and instrumentalities \nthereof, to purchase products and services directly from pre-vetted contractors. The GSA \nSchedules (also referred to as the Multiple Award Schedules and the Federal Supply \nSchedules) are long-term government-wide contracts with commercial firms that provide \naccess to millions of commercial products and services at volume discount pricing. \n \nInformation about GSA programs for states, tribes, and local governments, and \ninstrumentalities thereof, can be found on the GSA webpages for State and Local \nGovernments Resources and Schedule Buyers. \n \nFor tribes, local governments, and their instrumentalities that purchase off of a GSA \nschedule, this will satisfy the federal requirements for full and open competition provided \nthat the recipient follows the GSA ordering procedures; however, tribes, local governments, \nand their instrumentalities will still need to follow the other rules under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.317 \n– 200.327, such as solicitation of minority businesses, women’s business enterprises, small \nbusinesses, or labor surplus area firms (§ 200.321), domestic preferences (§ 200.322), \ncontract cost and price (§ 200.324), and required contract provisions (§ 200.327 and \nAppendix II). \n \nII.  OTHER SUPPLY SCHEDULES AND PROGRAMS \nFor non-federal entities other than states, such as tribes, local governments, and nonprofits, \nthat want to procure goods or services from a state supply schedule, cooperative purchasing \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 78 of 215\n40                                                                                                                           \nprogram, or other similar program, in order for such procurements to be permissible under \nfederal requirements, the following must be true: \n•  The procurement of the original contract or purchasing schedule and its use by the \nnon-federal entity complies with state and local law, regulations, and written \nprocurement procedures; \n•  The state or other entity that originally procured the original contract or purchasing \nschedule entered into the contract or schedule with the express purpose of making it \navailable to the non-federal entity and other similar types of entities; \n•  The contract or purchasing schedule specifically allows for such use, and the work to \nbe performed for the non-federal entity falls within the scope of work under the \ncontract as to type, amount, and geography; \n•  The procurement of the original contract or purchasing schedule complied with all the \nprocurement standards applicable to a non-federal entity other than states under at 2 \nC.F.R. §§ 200.317 – 200.327; and \n•  With respect to the use of a purchasing schedule, the non-federal entity must follow \nordering procedures that adhere to applicable state, tribal, and local laws and \nregulations and the minimum requirements of full and open competition under 2 \nC.F.R. Part 200. \n \nIf a non-federal entity other than a state seeks to use a state supply schedule, cooperative \npurchasing program, or other similar type of arrangement, FEMA recommends the recipient \ndiscuss the procurement plans with its FEMA Program Analyst or other relevant FEMA \nposition. \n \nd.  Procurement Documentation \nPer 2 C.F.R. § 200.318(i), non-federal entities other than states and territories are required to \nmaintain and retain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement covering at least the \nrationale for the procurement method, selection of contract type, contractor selection or \nrejection, and the basis for the contract price. States and territories are encouraged to maintain \nand retain this information as well and are reminded that in order for any cost to be allowable, \nit must be adequately documented per 2 C.F.R. § 200.403(g).  \n \nExamples of the types of documents that would cover this information include but are not \nlimited to: \n•  Solicitation documentation, such as requests for quotes, invitations for bids, or requests \nfor proposals; \n•  Responses to solicitations, such as quotes, bids, or proposals; \n•  Pre-solicitation independent cost estimates and post-solicitation cost/price analyses on \nfile for review by federal personnel, if applicable; \n•  Contract documents and amendments, including required contract provisions; and \n•  Other documents required by federal regulations applicable at the time a grant is \nawarded to a recipient. \n•  Additional information on required procurement records can be found on pages 24-26 \nof the PDAT Field Manual. \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 79 of 215\n41                                                                                                                           \n7.  Financial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure  \na.  Build America, Buy America Act \nRecipients and subrecipients must comply with the Build America, Buy America Act \n(BABAA), which was enacted as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act §§ \n70901-70927, Pub. L. No. 117-58 (2021); and Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is \nMade in All of America by All of America’s Workers. See also 2 C.F.R. Part 184 and Office \nof Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-24-02, Implementation Guidance on \nApplication of Buy America Preference in Federal Financial Assistance Programs for \nInfrastructure. \n \nNone of the funds provided under this program may be used for a project for infrastructure \nunless the iron and steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in that \ninfrastructure are produced in the United States. \n \nThe Buy America preference only applies to articles, materials, and supplies that are \nconsumed in, incorporated into, or affixed to an infrastructure project. As such, it does not \napply to tools, equipment, and supplies, such as temporary scaffolding, brought to the \nconstruction site and removed at or before the completion of the infrastructure project. Nor \ndoes a Buy America preference apply to equipment and furnishings, such as movable chairs, \ndesks, and portable computer equipment, that are used at or within the finished infrastructure \nproject but are not an integral part of the structure or permanently affixed to the infrastructure \nproject. \n \nFor FEMA's official policy on BABAA, please see FEMA Policy 207-22-0001: Buy \nAmerica Preference in FEMA Financial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure. To see \nwhether a particular FEMA federal financial assistance program is considered an \ninfrastructure program and thus required to include a Buy America preference, please see \nPrograms and Definitions: Build America, Buy America Act | FEMA.gov and Buy America \nPreference in FEMA Financial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure. \n \nb.  Waivers \nWhen necessary, recipients (and subrecipients through their pass-through entity) may apply \nfor, and FEMA may grant, a waiver from these requirements.  \n \nA waiver of the domestic content procurement preference may be granted by the agency \nawarding official if FEMA determines that: \n•  Applying the domestic content procurement preference would be inconsistent with \nthe public interest. \n•  The types of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials are not \nproduced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a \nsatisfactory quality. \n•  The inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials \nproduced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more \nthan 25%. \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 80 of 215\n42                                                                                                                           \nFor FEMA awards, the process for requesting a waiver from the Buy America preference \nrequirements can be found on FEMA’s website at: \"Buy America\" Preference in FEMA \nFinancial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure | FEMA.gov. \n \nc.  Definitions \nFor BABAA specific definitions, please refer to the FEMA Buy America website at: \n“Programs and Definitions: Build America, Buy America Act | FEMA.gov.” \nPlease refer to the applicable DHS Standard Terms & Conditions for the BABAA specific \nterm applicable to all FEMA financial assistance awards for infrastructure. \n \n8.  Record Retention \na.  Record Retention Period \nFinancial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other non-Federal entity \nrecords pertinent to a Federal award generally must be maintained for at least three years \nfrom the date the final FFR is submitted. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.334. Further, if the recipient \ndoes not submit a final FFR and the award is administratively closed, FEMA uses the date of \nadministrative closeout as the start of the general record retention period. \n \nThe record retention period may be longer than three years or have a different start date \nin certain cases. These include:  \n•  Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds must be \nretained for three years after final disposition of the property. See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.334(c).  \n•  If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the three-year \nperiod, the records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings \ninvolving the records have been resolved and final action taken. See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.334(a).  \n•  The record retention period will be extended if the non-federal entity is notified \nin writing of the extension by FEMA, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit, or \nthe cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity. See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.334(b).  \n•  Where FEMA requires recipients to report program income after the period of \nperformance ends, the program income record retention period begins at the end \nof the recipient’s fiscal year in which program income is earned. See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.334(e).  \n•  For indirect cost rate computations and proposals, cost allocation plans, or any similar \naccounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable \n(such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates), the start \nof the record retention period depends on whether the indirect cost rate documents \nwere submitted for negotiation. If the indirect cost rate documents were submitted \nfor negotiation, the record retention period begins from the date those \ndocuments were submitted for negotiation. If indirect cost rate documents were not \nsubmitted for negotiation, the record retention period begins at the end of the \nrecipient’s fiscal year or other accounting period covered by that indirect cost \nrate. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.334(f). \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 81 of 215\n43                                                                                                                           \n \nb.  Types of Records to Retain \nFEMA requires that non-federal entities maintain the following documentation for federally \nfunded purchases: \n•  Specifications \n•  Solicitations \n•  Competitive quotes or proposals \n•  Basis for selection decisions \n•  Purchase orders \n•  Contracts \n•  Invoices \n•  Cancelled checks \n \nNon-federal entities should keep detailed records of all transactions involving the grant. \nFEMA may at any time request copies of any relevant documentation and records, including \npurchasing documentation along with copies of cancelled checks for verification. See, e.g., 2 \nC.F.R. §§ 200.318(i), 200.334, 200.337. \n \nIn order for any cost to be allowable, it must be adequately documented per 2 C.F.R. § \n200.403(g). Non-federal entities who fail to fully document all purchases may find their \nexpenditures questioned and subsequently disallowed.  \n \n9.  Actions to Address Noncompliance  \nNon-federal entities receiving financial assistance funding from FEMA are required to \ncomply with requirements in the terms and conditions of their awards or subawards, \nincluding the terms set forth in applicable federal statutes, regulations, NOFOs, and policies. \nThroughout the award lifecycle or even after an award has been closed, FEMA or the pass-\nthrough entity may discover potential or actual noncompliance on the part of a recipient or \nsubrecipient. This potential or actual noncompliance may be discovered through routine \nmonitoring, audits, civil rights complaint investigations and compliance reviews, closeout, or \nreporting from various sources. \n \nIn the case of any potential or actual noncompliance, FEMA may place special conditions on \nan award per 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.208 and 200.339, FEMA may place a hold on funds until the \nmatter is corrected, or additional information is provided per 2 C.F.R. § 200.339, or it may do \nboth. Similar remedies for noncompliance with certain federal civil rights laws are authorized \npursuant to 44 C.F.R. Parts 7 and 19 or other applicable regulations. \n \nIn the event the noncompliance is not able to be corrected by imposing additional conditions \nor the recipient or subrecipient refuses to correct the matter, FEMA may take other remedies \nallowed under 2 C.F.R. § 200.339. These remedies include actions to disallow costs, recover \nfunds, wholly or partly suspend or terminate the award, initiate suspension and debarment \nproceedings, withhold further federal awards, or take other remedies that may be legally \navailable. For further information on termination due to noncompliance, see the section on \nTermination Provisions in the NOFO. \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 82 of 215\n44                                                                                                                           \nFEMA may discover and take action on noncompliance even after an award has been closed. \nThe closeout of an award does not affect FEMA’s right to disallow costs and recover funds \nas long as the action to disallow costs takes place during the record retention period. See 2 \nC.F.R. §§ 200.334, 200.345(a). Closeout also does not affect the obligation of the non-federal \nentity to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions. 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.345(a)(2). \n \nThe types of funds FEMA may attempt to recover include, but are not limited to, improper \npayments, cost share reimbursements, program income, interest earned on advance payments, \nor equipment disposition amounts. \n \nFEMA may seek to recover disallowed costs through a Notice of Potential Debt Letter, a \nRemedy Notification, or other letter. The document will describe the potential amount owed, \nthe reason why FEMA is recovering the funds, the recipient’s appeal rights, how the amount \ncan be paid, and the consequences for not appealing or paying the amount by the deadline. \n \nIf the recipient neither appeals nor pays the amount by the deadline, the amount owed will \nbecome final. Potential consequences if the debt is not paid in full or otherwise resolved by \nthe deadline include the assessment of interest, administrative fees, and penalty charges; \nadministratively offsetting the debt against other payable federal funds; and transferring the \ndebt to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for collection. \n \nFEMA notes the following common areas of noncompliance for FEMA’s grant programs: \n•  Insufficient documentation and lack of record retention. \n•  Failure to follow the procurement under grants requirements. \n•  Failure to submit closeout documents in a timely manner. \n•  Failure to follow EHP requirements. \n•  Failure to comply with the POP deadline. \n \n10. Audits  \nFEMA grant recipients are subject to audit oversight from multiple entities including the \nDHS OIG, the GAO, the pass-through entity, or independent auditing firms for single audits, \nand may cover activities and costs incurred under the award. Auditing agencies such as the \nDHS OIG, the GAO, and the pass-through entity (if applicable), and FEMA in its oversight \ncapacity, must have access to records pertaining to the FEMA award. Recipients and \nsubrecipients must retain award documents for at least three years from the date the final \nFFR is submitted, and even longer in many cases subject to the requirements of 2 C.F.R. § \n200.334. In the case of administrative closeout, documents must be retained for at least three \nyears from the date of closeout, or longer subject to the requirements of 2 C.F.R. § 200.334. \nIf documents are retained longer than the required retention period, the DHS OIG, the GAO, \nand the pass-through entity, as well as FEMA in its oversight capacity, have the right to \naccess these records as well. See 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.334, 200.337. \n \nAdditionally, non-federal entities must comply with the single audit requirements at 2 C.F.R. \nPart 200, Subpart F. Specifically, non-federal entities, other than for-profit subrecipients, that \nexpend $750,000 or more in federal awards during their fiscal year must have a single or \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 83 of 215\n45                                                                                                                           \nprogram-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with Subpart F. 2 C.F.R. § \n200.501. A single audit covers all federal funds expended during a fiscal year, not just FEMA \nfunds. The cost of audit services may be allowable per 2 C.F.R. § 200.425, but non-federal \nentities must select auditors in accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.509, including following the \nproper procurement procedures. For additional information on single audit reporting \nrequirements, see section F of this NOFO under the header “Single Audit Report” within the \nsubsection “Additional Reporting Requirements” or other applicable document. \n \nThe objectives of single audits are to: \n•  Determine if financial statements conform to generally accepted accounting \nprinciples (GAAP); \n•  Determine whether the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented fairly; \n•  Understand, assess, and test the adequacy of internal controls for compliance with \nmajor programs; and \n•  Determine if the entity complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contracts or \ngrants. \n \nFor single audits, the auditee is required to prepare financial statements reflecting its \nfinancial position, a schedule of federal award expenditures, and a summary of the status of \nprior audit findings and questioned costs. The auditee also is required to follow up and take \nappropriate corrective actions on new and previously issued but not yet addressed audit \nfindings. The auditee must prepare a corrective action plan to address the new audit findings. \n2 C.F.R. §§ 200.508, 200.510, 200.511. \n \nNon-federal entities must have an audit conducted, either single or program-specific, of their \nfinancial statements and federal expenditures annually or biennially pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § \n200.504. Non-federal entities must also follow the information submission requirements of 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.512, including submitting the audit information to the Federal Audit \nClearinghouse within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor’s report(s) or \nnine months after the end of the audit period. The audit information to be submitted include \nthe data collection form described at 2 C.F.R. § 200.512(c) and Appendix X to 2 C.F.R. Part \n200 as well as the reporting package described at 2 C.F.R. § 200.512(b). \n \nThe non-federal entity must retain one copy of the data collection form and one copy of the \nreporting package for three years from the date of submission to the Federal Audit \nClearinghouse. 2 C.F.R. § 200.512; see also 2 C.F.R. § 200.517 (setting requirements for \nretention of documents by the auditor and access to audit records in the auditor’s possession). \n \nFEMA, the DHS OIG, the GAO, and the pass-through entity (if applicable), as part of \nmonitoring or as part of an audit, may review a non-federal entity’s compliance with the \nsingle audit requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit \nconducted in compliance with 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F, FEMA and the pass-through \nentity, if applicable, are required to take appropriate remedial action under 2 C.F.R. § \n200.339 for noncompliance, pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.505. \n \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 84 of 215\n46                                                                                                                           \n11. Payment Information \nFEMA uses the Direct Deposit/Electronic Funds Transfer (DD/EFT) method of payment to \nrecipients.  \n \nPayment requests are submitted through FEMA GO. \n \n12. Whole Community Preparedness \nPreparedness is a shared responsibility that calls for the involvement of everyone—not just \nthe government—in preparedness efforts. By working together, everyone can help keep the \nnation safe from harm and help keep it resilient when struck by hazards, such as natural \ndisasters, acts of terrorism, and pandemics. \n \nWhole Community includes: \n•  Individuals and families, including those with access and functional needs \n•  Businesses \n•  Faith-based and community organizations \n•  Nonprofit groups \n•  Schools and academia \n•  Media outlets \n•  All levels of government, including state, local, tribal, territorial, and federal partners \n \nThe phrase “Whole Community” often appears in preparedness materials, as it is one of the \nguiding principles. It means two things: \n1.  Involving people in the development of national preparedness documents. \n2.  Ensuring their roles and responsibilities are reflected in the content of the \n  materials. \n \n12. Report Issues of Fraud, Waste, Abuse \nPlease note, when applying to this notice of funding opportunity and when administering the \ngrant, applicants may report issues of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or other \ncriminal or noncriminal misconduct to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) Hotline. The \ntoll-free numbers to call are 1-800-323-8603, and TTY 1-844-889-4357. \n \n13. Hazard-Resistant Building Codes \nHazard-resistant building codes are a foundational element of a more resilient nation, \nsafeguarding communities and lives against natural disasters, with an estimated $11:1 return \non investment. The adoption, enforcement and application of modern building codes \nmitigates community vulnerabilities, reduces disaster recovery costs, and strengthens \nnationwide capability. FEMA is working to promote and support building codes in all areas \nof its work in support of the multi-agency National Initiative to Advance Building Codes. In \nthe interest of building a stronger, more resilient nation, FEMA encourages all grant \nrecipients and subrecipients to meet current published editions of relevant consensus-based \nbuilding codes, specifications and standards, and to exceed them where feasible.” \n   \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 85 of 215\n47                                                                                                                           \nAppendix A: Allowable Activities \nTo be reimbursed, all costs must be allowable, reasonable, and allocable (2 CFR §§ 200.403 - \n405).

Reviewing this \ninformation may help recipients in the programmatic and financial administration of their \naward(s). \n \nPayments and Amendments \nFEMA uses the Direct Deposit/Electronic Funds Transfer (DD/EFT) method of payment to \nrecipients. SSP payment/drawdown requests are generated using FEMA GO. SSP \npayment/drawdown requests will be governed by applicable federal regulations in effect at the \ntime a grant is awarded to the recipient and may be either advances or reimbursements. \nRecipients should not expend funds until all special conditions listed on the grant award \ndocument have been met, including completion of EHP review, active SAM.gov registration, and \nthe request for payment in FEMA GO has been approved.  \n \nRecipients should draw down funds based upon immediate disbursement requirements; however, \nFEMA strongly encourages recipients to draw down funds as close to disbursement or \nexpenditure as possible to avoid accruing interest.  \n \nNon-federal entities must submit the following documents at time of drawdown requests: \n•  If the drawdown request includes money for a subrecipient, specify the subrecipient and \nallowable activities the funding covers. \n•  For renovations or modifications to rented real property only: If an applicant or \nsubapplicant is requesting funding for renovations or modifications to rented real \nproperty and documentation has not previously been provided, submit rental agreement \naddressing space, any limitations of use, and rental period. \n•  For all services covered by the draw down request, provide Alien Registration Numbers \n(A-Numbers) or evidence of DHS processing (e.g., I-94, I-385, I-860, I-862): A summary \nlist reporting A-Numbers, names, corresponding DHS release dates of the served \npopulation, and corresponding service dates of the served population. Please do not send \ncopies of the forms themselves. Applicants must use the provided A-Number Submission \nTemplate to populate the information. Recipients must ensure that full A-Numbers and \naccurate dates of service are provided. \n•  Proof of Purchase Documentation:  \n  For each requested allowable activity service category (See Appendix A), provide \no\none example of proof of payment (e.g., canceled check, credit card statement, \netc.) and a receipt reflecting the purchase. Provide one document inclusive of all \nproofs of payment and receipts less than $5,000. In the document (a spreadsheet is \npreferred), identify the following things: \n  For each proof of payment receipt, the allowable activity/service category \nbeing funded (see the Application Worksheet, Budget Worksheet tab for \ncategories) \n  The date of the receipt \n  The proof of purchase associated with the line item (file name, page \nnumber, transaction ID, or other unique identifier to clearly link the line \nitem with the proof of purchase) \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 91 of 215\n53                                                                                                                           \n  The line item details from the receipt (what the item is) \n  The quantity if more than one \n  The amount requested for reimbursement by line item, not receipt total  \n  If applicable, which proofs of payment and receipts are for which \nsubrecipient. \n  For each purchase or allowable cost of $5,000 or more, provide proof of payment \no\nand a receipt reflecting the purchase or other documentation demonstrating \ncalculation and allocation of cost in accordance with 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E. \nProvide one document inclusive of all proofs of payment and receipts $5,000 or \nmore. In the document, identify which proofs of payment and receipts are for \nwhich allowable activity service category (See Appendix A). If applicable, also \nidentify which proofs of payment and receipts are for which subrecipient. \n \nNon-federal entities should keep detailed records of all transactions involving the grant. FEMA \nmay at any time request copies of any relevant documentation and records. See, e.g., 2 C.F.R. §§ \n200.318(i), 200.334, 200.337.  \n \nReimbursement and Advance Funding \nFEMA recognizes that many SSP recipients and subrecipients – particularly nonprofit \norganizations – may not have the requisite cash on hand readily available for immediate \nprocurement of services. Given this situation, FEMA will allow for advanced-based funding in \naddition to the preferred reimbursement-based funding, with the following caveats: \n \nReimbursement \nPayment by reimbursement is the preferred method (see 2 C.F.R. § 200.305). As a prerequisite of \nSSP approval for reimbursement requests, recipients shall include proof of purchase, in the form \nof a canceled check or credit card transaction, active SAM.gov registration, and a final invoice(s) \nin each reimbursement SSP Program payment/drawdown request. In accordance with U.S. \nDepartment of Treasury regulations at 31 C.F.R. Part 205, if applicable, the recipient shall \nmaintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and the \ndisbursement of said funds.  \n \nAdvance Funding \nRecipients may be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and \nability to maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and its \ndisbursement by the recipient (not to exceed 30 days), and the financial management systems \nthat meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in 2 C.F.R. Part 200. \nThe recipient shall include invoice(s) and/or purchase orders for advance SSP \npayment/drawdown requests. In the case of advance payments, recipients must submit additional \ndocumentation (e.g., A-Number template) after the disbursement of funds. EHP review \nrequirements must be met prior to advanced payments. Although advance drawdown requests are \npermissible, recipients remain subject to applicable federal laws in effect at the time a grant is \nawarded to the recipient. Governing interest requirements include the Uniform Administrative \nRequirements Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards at 2 C.F.R. Part 200 \nand the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) and its implementing regulations at 31 \nC.F.R. Part 205. Interest under CMIA will accrue from the time federal funds are credited to a \nFY 2024 Shelter and Services Program – Competitive (SSP-C) \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 92 of 215\n54                                                                                                                           \nrecipient’s account until the time the recipient pays out the funds for program purposes. For the \nrate to use in calculating interest, please visit Treasury Current Value rate. \n \nPayment Requests During Closeout \nA recipient may only submit reimbursement payment requests up to 120 calendar days after the \nexpiration of the period of performance, during an award’s closeout reconciliation. \nReimbursement payments are the only eligible type of requests to be submitted after a grant’s \nperiod of performance has expired. The expenditure must have been obligated and received \nduring the period of performance of the award. The recipient’s request should contain clear and \nspecific information certifying that the liquidation of federal funds is reimbursement for an \nobligation properly incurred during the active period of performance; FEMA may request \ndocumentation supporting the reimbursement for review at any time.  \n \nAmendments \nFEMA may approve SSP award amendments on a case-by-case basis, for the following reasons:  \n•  Extension of the period of performance in order to complete the scope of work;  \n•  Changes to the activity, mission, retroactive approval (pre-award), closeout issues, and \nsome excess funds requests;  \n•  Program adjustments due to pressing need (transfer or redistribute available funds from \nuses described in the submitted budget to other uses within the grant scope); \n•  Budget changes (adding funds to award/non-closeout deobligation of funds); or \n•  Adding subrecipients to an award. To add a subrecipient to an award: \n  Provide the information listed on Tab 3 Subapplicant Information of the \no\nApplication Worksheet. \n  Applicants must verify the nonprofit status of subapplicants and retain a copy of \no\nthe documentation submitted by the subapplicant(s) as evidence of their nonprofit \nstatus for auditing purposes. \nFEMA will only consider amendments submitted via FEMA GO. These requests must contain \nspecific and compelling justifications for the requested change. Amendments or changes to the \nscope of work may require additional EHP review. FEMA strongly encourages recipients to \nexpend grant funds in a timely manner, to be consistent with SSP goals and objectives. All \namendments require recipients to maintain an active SAM.gov registration.  \n \nNOTE: A recipient may deobligate (i.e., return) unused funds (i.e., those remaining funds \npreviously drawn down via payment request and/or remaining award funding that was never \nrequested) to DHS/FEMA prior to the end of an award’s period of performance. To exercise \nthis option, a recipient must submit an amendment via FEMA GO and state in the amendment \nthat the unliquidated funds (i.e., the funds to be returned) are not necessary for the fulfillment \nor success of the grant’s obligations or mission.

Washington estimates that 21,457 noncitizens arrived between \nJanuary 2023 and December 20023, and approximately 18% (3,841 people) reported experiencing \nhomelessness. Arriving from the Southwest border after being released from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, many noncitizen migrants are entering the homeless crisis response system seeker shelter and \nsafety. The housing and homeless crisis response system in Washington is already over capacity, and \nemergency shelters across the state are filled nightly. This system is unequipped to respond to the specific \nbarriers and root causes that make newcomers vulnerable to experiencing homelessness. \n \nIn response to this situation, the DSHS Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance is launching the \nWashington Migrant and Asylum-Seeker Support Project. This project will utilize a hub and spoke model to \nensure coordination across all service areas and to provide customized care to walk along-side each \nnewcomer in navigating supports and services as they rebuild their lives in the United States.  The project will \nprovide six core areas of services, including reception and navigation services, emergency shelter, transitional \nhousing, culturally responsive case management services, immigration-related legal services, and education, \nemployment, and training services.   \n \nWashington is seeking funding from the DHS FEMA Shelter and Services Competitive application to provide \nemergency housing services to support qualified noncitizen migrants.  DSHS ORIA serves as the primary \napplicant for this proposal and proposes to partner with subrecipient organizations to provide primary and \nsecondary services. Currently, Washington estimates that there are proximately 1,200 to 1,500 noncitizen \nmigrants residing in hotels, family shelters, or living in tent encampments. If awarded, DSHS ORIA would \ncontract with multiple partner entities to provide allowable services under this funding, including shelter, \nacute medical care, food, outreach, translation, and other servicers.  \n \nAbout DSHS Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance \nThe Washington Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance coordinates statewide efforts to support \nthe economic and social integration and basic needs of immigrant and refugees arriving and resettling in \nWashington. In Federal Fiscal Year 2024, ORIA invested over $100 million of federal and state funding \ninto local community organizations to provide services focused on health and wellness, employment and \ntraining, immigration assistance and naturalization, and whole family programs. These programs and \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 95 of 215\nWA DSHS ORIA \nDSH FEMA SSP 2024 \nservices are provided by over 100 subrecipient organizations that specialize in providing culturally \nresponsive and linguistically appropriate services. \n \nIn response to the community growing number of noncitizens migrants experiencing homelessness, the \nWashington State Legislature passed Substitute House Bill 2368 in 2024, which expands the legal \nauthority for the DSHS Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance  to coordinate statewide efforts to \nsupport the economic and social integration and basic needs of immigrants and refugees arriving and \nresettling in Washington and to provide services to people who are ineligible for federal refugee \nresettlement services.  In addition, the Legislature appropriated $25,250,000 to DSHS ORIA for state \nfiscal years 2024 and 2025 to expand support services for individuals newly arriving to the U.S. and to \nWashington who do not qualify for federal refugee resettlement services.  Approximately, $10,000,000 \nof the annualized budget will provide humanitarian services as defined under the Shelter and Services \nProgram notice of funding opportunity, and 100% of ORIA’s annualized budget to support humanitarian \nservices will go directly to noncitizen migrant services.   \n \nSubrecipient Partners  \na.  The City of Tukwila provides support to noncitizen migrants and asylum seekers residing on the \npremises of the Riverton Park United Methodist Church as well as other locations throughout \ntheir jurisdiction. Their efforts support 200 to 250 people per night.  \nb.  The Seattle King County Department of Public Health has provided acute medical care to \nnoncitizen migrants residing in various encampments and hotels.   \nc.  Mary’s Place Seattle has a long history of welcoming noncitizen migrant families and providing \nshelter and services to them.  They propose anticipate serving 150 noncitizen migrants per \nnight. \nd.  DSHS ORIA is conducting an open application process to identify additional partners to provide \nhumanitarian services, specifically shelter and emergency housing, to noncitizen migrants. This \nNotice of Funding Opportunity closes on June 13, 2024, will announce successful partners in July \nto start services in August 2024.

In addition, for funds \nalready obligated, all disbursements and payments must be reviewed by Secretary Noem prior to \nissuance. If and when you becomes aware that a government recipient or sub-receipient has used \nFEMA funds to pay a non-government organization, I am directing you to report that information to \nthe Secretary. \nwww.fema.gov \n\nCase 1C:2a5s-ec v2-:02050-c3v9--0J1J4M0-1P-BAJSR        D  Doocucummeennt 1t 16 6  - 7 F  i l e Fdi l0e7d/ 2053//2154 / 2  5 P   a  gPea 1g7e8 2 o of f2 21 5PageID\n#: 8376\n(2) Funding for Non-Congregate Sheltering \nMultiple states have used FEMA funding to provide non-congregate sheltering to illegal aliens. \nTherefore, effective immediately, all new non-congregate sheltering obligations must be reviewed \nby Secretary Noem prior to obligation. In addition, for funds already obligated, all disbursements \nand payments must be reviewed by Secretary Noem prior to issuance. \n \nGrant Obligations to be Provided for Secretary Noem’s Visibility \nIn addition to the guidance above, I am directing the Agency to ensure full transparency with \nSecretary Noem. As such, FEMA will leverage the transmittal process specified by Section 507 of \nthe Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act to notify the DHS Office of the Chief \nFinance Officer of all pending obligations over $1M. FEMA will notify additional DHS offices or \npoints of contact at Secretary Noem’s request. \n \nAdditional Review of Disaster Assistance Programs \nI am directing the Office of Response and Recovery to conduct a review of all disaster relief \nprograms that may indirectly or incidentally aid illegal aliens, or NGOs that provide assistance to \nillegal aliens. This review shall include the identification of these programs and potential policy \nchanges. \n \nHold of Funds Under Shelter and Services Program, Case Management Pilot Program, and \nEmergency Food and Shelter Program-Humanitarian  \nGrants under the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP), \nand Emergency Food and Shelter Program-Humanitarian (EFSP-H) are on hold, pending a \ncompliance review, per Secretary Noem’s direction. No new obligation, disbursement or payment of \nfunds previously obligated may be issued pending additional guidance from Secretary Noem.  \n \nImplementation \nI am directing the Offices of Response and Recovery and Resilience (1)to identify all pending \nobligations, disbursements, and payments that may require Secretary Noem’s review and (2)to \nproceed with existing processes for obligations, disbursements, and payments that do not require \nSecretary Noem’s review no later than close of business Tuesday, February 18. \n \nI am directing the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, with the Offices of Response and Recovery \nand Resilience, to begin transmitting pending obligations, disbursements, and payments to Secretary \nNoem no later than close of business Friday, February 21. \n \nConclusion \nThis guidance is necessary to ensure that funding is obligated, disbursed, and paid in line with \nSecretary Noem’s direction, and that we can continue to support the communities and disaster \nsurvivors who rely on us for assistance. On a weekly basis, I will engage DHS Leadership to \ndetermine whether additional or modified criteria must be applied. Therefore, you must ensure that \nthe processes you implement are adaptable to new or adjusted review criteria. \nwww.fema.gov \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 179 of 215\n \n \nEXHIBIT 7   \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 180 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 181 of 215\n(cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:10)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:4)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:14)!(cid:14)(cid:6)!(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:2)\"(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:28)(cid:14)(cid:5)(cid:22)#(cid:5)(cid:28)(cid:14)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:2)\"(cid:4)$(cid:21)\n%(cid:7)(cid:5)&’(cid:15)(cid:14)\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 182 of 215\nEXHIBIT 8\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 183 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 184 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 185 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 186 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 187 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 188 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 189 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 190 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 191 of 215\n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 192 of 215\n\n \nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 193 of 215\nAppendix A \nFederal Emergency Management Agency Grant Programs Overview \nBackground/Purpose \nOn Feb. 19, 2025, Secretary Noem issued a memorandum Restricting Grant Funding for \nSanctuary Jurisdictions and directed all components to review all federal financial assistance \nawards to determine if Department funds, directly or indirectly, are going to sanctuary \njurisdictions (hereinafter “S1 Memo”).

DHS/FEMA further requested that DSHS provide certain information by April 11, 2025, \nstated that additional information regarding the new “specific conditions” would be forthcoming, and \nindicated that DSHS had until May 11, 2025, to appeal DSH/FEMA’s withholding action. DHS/FEMA \nalso instructed DSHS not to incur additional costs under the SSP Grant. \nOn April 1, 2025, without further communication from DHS/FEMA and before the deadlines set forth in \nthe SSP Withholding Notice had passed, DHS/FEMA notified DSHS that its SSP Grant had been \nterminated. DHS/FEMA stated that it had decided to terminate the SSP Grant because it “no longer \neffectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” \nThe interruption in available SSP Grant funding, as well as the uncertainty caused by the manner in \nwhich DHS/FEMA carried out these actions, has caused, and will continue to cause, irreparable harm to \nthe State of Washington and the communities it serves. \nTo date, DSHS has fully complied with its obligations under the SSP Grant, which effectuates a program \nlawfully authorized and funded by Congress to serve important federal policy goals and objectives. \nThus, there was no lawful basis for DHS/FEMA to either withhold or terminate DSHS’ SSP Grant. \nAccordingly, and without waiving any rights to challenge DHS/FEMA’s actions in any appropriate \nvenue or any arguments or claims DSHS may raise therein, we respectfully submit this written objection \nto both notices and request that DHS/FEMA immediately rescind its decisions to withhold and/or \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01401-BJR     Document 1     Filed 07/25/25     Page 215 of 215\nDSHS Disputing Termination \n \nPage Two \nApril 23, 2025 \n \n \n \nterminate DSHS’ SSP Grant and make those funds immediately available to DSHS, subject to applicable \nand valid award terms and conditions. \nWe request a response to this objection and a decision on our demand for corrective action by May 9, \n2025, 9 a.m. (PST), as to whether the termination will be rescinded.  \n \nWe reserve all rights to pursue any and all available relief and to receive any and all process due. \nSincerely, \n \nCheryl Strange \nSecretary  \n  \ncc:   Lisa Yanagida, DSHS Chief of Staff, Office of the Secretary \nBarbara Serrano, DSHS Deputy Chief of Staff, Office of the Secretary \nRichard Pannkuk, DSHS Chief Financial Officer, Facilities, Finance & Analytics Administration \nCarla Reyes, DSHS Assistant Secretary, Economic Services Administration \nSarah Peterson, DSHS Chief, Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance \nAlonso Cano, Assistant Attorney General, Washington Attorney General’s Office \nGrace Huang, Senior Policy Advisor, Office of Governor Bob Ferguson \nNathan Bays, Deputy Policy Director, Office of Governor Bob Ferguson \n \n \nEnclosed:   \nRemedy for Noncompliance Letter, Shelter and Services Program (SSP), dated March 11, 2025 \nTermination Notice dated April 1, 2025 \n \n ",
