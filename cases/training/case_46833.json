Plaintiffs challenged Section 71113 of \"An Act to Provide for Reconciliation under Title II of H. Con. Res. 14\" (the \"Defund Provision\"), which prohibited the use of federal funds for any health care services obtained at Planned Parenthood health centers.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that the Defund Provision violated the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution. According to the complaint, the Defund Provision denied access to health centers that provided essential, lifesaving care, such as cancer screening and prevention, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STI), and family planning services, as retribution for the health centers&rsquo; political advocacy. &nbsp;Plaintiffs requested the Court to declare that the Defund Provision was unconstitutional, enter a preliminary and permanent injunction against Defendants and any other agency or employee acting on behalf of Defendants prohibiting enforcement of the Defund Provision, and award the States&rsquo; costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Indira Talwani was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>On September 24, 2025 the state of California filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining the government from implementing or enforcing Section 7113 of the &ldquo;One Big Beautiful Bill.&rdquo; The plaintiffs and the defendants then moved jointly to compel the court to set the briefing schedule regarding plaintiff&rsquo;s preliminary injunction motion and to stay the government's obligation to file a response to plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint pending resolution of the preliminary injunction. In this motion, the parties agreed on dates for the government to respond to plaintiff&rsquo;s preliminary injunction motion and for plaintiffs to reply to the government's response. Judge Talwani granted the joint motion.</p>\r\n<p>On October 1, 2025, the government filed a motion to stay the proceedings in light of the appropriations act funding the Department of Justice lapsing due to the government shutdown.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

In a December 4, 2024, interview about his plans following the inauguration of \nPresident Donald Trump, House Speaker Michael Johnson was asked about whether he would \n“axe” Planned Parenthood.1  He responded: “I would like to, that’s for sure.”2   \n2.  Speaker Johnson’s plans are just the latest in a years-long effort by the President \nand members of Congress to punish Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and its \nmember health centers (Planned Parenthood health centers) for their advocacy for reproductive \nchoice in this country.  And now, Congress has done so, by passing legislation stripping federal \nMedicaid funding from the Planned Parenthood health centers in retribution for PPFA and the \nPlanned Parenthood health centers’ constitutionally protected advocacy. \n3.  In so doing, Congress has conscripted the States to enforce its unconstitutional \ntargeting of PPFA and the Planned Parenthood health centers.  Because Medicaid is a state-\nfederal partnership in which the states administer claims from medical providers for Medicaid \nreimbursements, the states—not the federal government—would ultimately be required to ensure \nthat the Planned Parenthood health centers are effectively excluded from federal funding under \nthe Defund Provision.  And in so doing, Congress has also forced the States to harm themselves, \nby either 1) crippling the States’ medical healthcare ecosystems as Planned Parenthood health \ncenters close or reduce hours and services, thereby increasing the States’ long-term medical care \ncosts, or 2) using the States’ own funds to keep those health centers operating—and thereby \nforegoing matching federal funds. \n \n1 House Speaker Michael Johnson, Speaker Johnson Joins The Story with Martha \nMacCallum, YouTube (Dec. 4, 2024), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOM5wRs1WFc \n(hereinafter Speaker Johnson Interview Dec. 2024). \n2 Id.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 3 of 83\n4.  The Plaintiff States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of \nColumbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina Oregon, Rhode \nIsland, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, and Governor Josh Shapiro, in his official \ncapacity as Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (collectively, Plaintiff States) now \nbring this action to avoid being compelled to participate in Congress’s unconstitutional conduct. \nTo that end, the States bring this challenge to Section 71113 of “An Act to provide for \nreconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14” (the Defund Provision).  \n5.  The Defund Provision is a stand-alone provision that eliminates the use of federal \nfunds for any health care obtained at Planned Parenthood health centers.  Congress specifically \ndesigned the Defund Provision to target and punish PPFA and the Planned Parenthood health \ncenters for advocating for abortion access.  The Defund Provision will prevent Planned \nParenthood health centers from providing healthcare to millions of Americans who rely on \nMedicaid for their essential healthcare needs.  As explained below, the Defund Provision also \nincidentally sweeps in a couple of additional healthcare entities who provide abortion care.  \nThese entities are just collateral damage in Congress’s unconstitutional targeting of the Planned \nParenthood health centers.  But those health centers also provide critical healthcare, and so their \n“defunding” only contributes to the devasting effects of Congress’s action. \n6.  To be clear, this is not about abortion funding. Under longstanding federal law, \nfederal funds may not be used to provide abortions, except in extremely narrow circumstances. \nInstead, the Defund Provision denies access to health centers that provide essential, lifesaving \ncare, such as cancer screening and prevention, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted \ninfections (STI), and family planning services, all in the name of retribution for PPFA and \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 4 of 83\nPlanned Parenthood health centers’ political advocacy.  And the result is devasting consequences \nfor those who will be denied care in the Plaintiff States, as well as negative impacts to the \nPlaintiff States themselves. \n7.  The Defund Provision is unconstitutional in several respects.  It contains several \nambiguous elements, leading to uncertainty about who determines whether an entity qualifies as \na “prohibited entity,” whether an entity qualifies as a “prohibited entity,” and the timing of the \nprovision.  And through its targeting of PPFA and Planned Parenthood health centers, the \nDefund Provision violates the First Amendment’s protections for freedom of speech and \nfreedom of association and Article I’s prohibition on bills of attainder.  The Plaintiff States \nshould not be co-opted into participation in these unconstitutional acts. \n8.  The Plaintiff States seek a declaration that the Defund Provision is \nunconstitutional as well as an injunction against enforcement of the Defund Provision by \nDefendants U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his \nofficial capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services; and Dr. Mehmet Oz, in his official capacity as administrator \nfor the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (collectively, Defendants). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n9.

Millions of people rely on health services and benefits provided by Medicaid, the \nfederal-state cooperative health programs serving low-income individuals and families.  These \n \n3 See H.R. Con. Res., 119th Cong. § 71113(c) (2025) (hereinafter Section 71113) \n(appropriating funds “to the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services” \n“[f]r the purposes of carrying out this section”). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 10 of 83\ncritical health coverage programs serve millions of families, children, pregnant individuals, \nadults without children, seniors, and people living with disabilities.  As of October 2024, 72 \nmillion people across the U.S. were covered by Medicaid and relied on this essential program.4 \n41.  Medicaid operates as a state and federal partnership with states administering the \nprograms and the federal government covering a substantial portion of the costs, reimbursing \nstates between 50 and 90 percent of expenditures on eligible children and adults.  Such \nreimbursements incentivize states to further the primary goal of the program: providing health \nservices and benefits to low-income individuals and families. \n42.  Medicaid affords “substantial discretion” to participating states.  Alexander v. \nChoate, 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985).  That commitment to state discretion is apparent from the text \nand structure of the Medicaid statute itself.  States can choose whether to participate in Medicaid \nin the first place.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a.  And even after states sign up, Medicaid is not a take-\nit-or-leave-it proposition.  Instead, the statute affords each participating state “substantial \ndiscretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and duration limitations on coverage.” \nAlexander, 469 U.S. at 303.  \n43.  Although states’ participation in Medicaid is voluntary, once they choose to \nparticipate, states must comply with federal statutory and regulatory requirements, including the \ncreation of a State Plan outlining the administration of their respective Medicaid programs.  42 \nC.F.R. § 431.10.  State Plans provide assurances that states will abide by federal rules to claim \nfederal matching funds; indicate which optional groups, services, or programs states have chosen \n \n4 See Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., October 2024: Medicaid and CHIP \nEligibility Operations and Enrollment Snapshot, Medicaid.gov 8 (Jan. 15, 2025), \nhttps://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/downloads/eligib-oper-and-enrol-snap-\noctober2024.pdf  \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 11 of 83\nto cover or implement; and describe the state-specific standards to determine eligibility, \nmethodologies for providers to be reimbursed, and processes to administer the program. \n44.  Congress requires states to include several broad categories of benefits and \nservices in their Medicaid programs, such as inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital \nservices, laboratory and x-ray services, nursing facility services, family planning services, \nphysician services, nurse-midwife services, and nurse-practitioner services.5  42 U.S.C. §§ \n1396a(a)(10), 1396d(a)(1)-(5), (17), (21).  Within those categories, states retain discretion to \ninclude specific services in the State Plan. \n45.  Congress has also excluded certain services from Medicaid by prohibiting the use \nof federal money to pay for the service.  The Hyde Amendment, for example, generally prohibits \nthe use of federal funds for abortions, with certain exceptions.  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 94–439, § \n209, 90 Stat. 1418, 1434 (1976) (initial version). \n46.  Beyond these Congressionally mandated categories of inclusions and specific \nexclusions, Congress has delegated policy decisions about what services should be covered to \nparticipating states by allowing them to develop their own State Plans that specify, among other \nthings, the particular covered services within the broad categories of inclusions in the Act.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10); 42 C.F.R. § 431.10. \n47.  Each state thus specifies the nature and scope of its Medicaid program through its \nState Plan.  42 C.F.R. § 430.10.  States retain discretion to provide medical services not \nspecifically delineated in the Act, such as dental services, prosthetics, and prescription drugs.  42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396d(a).  States are also free to provide coverage through their own \n \n5 See also Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., Mandatory & Optional Medicaid \nBenefits, Medicaid.gov, https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/benefits/mandatory-optional-\nmedicaid-benefits (last visited July 22, 2025). \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 12 of 83\nfunds for any medical services or categories of enrollees that the federal government does not \nfund.    \n48.  The Medicaid Act provides that any individual eligible for assistance under a \nstate Medicaid program may choose any provider “qualified to perform the service or services \nrequired . . . who undertakes to provide him such services,” other than “a person or entity \nconvicted of a felony under Federal or State law for an offense which the State agency \ndetermines is inconsistent with the best interests of beneficiaries under the State plan.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23).  Because it does not define the term “qualified,” the Act leaves \nsubstantial discretion to states—exercising their traditional role regulating health and safety—in \ndetermining providers’ qualifications for inclusion in their Medicaid programs.  See Medina v. \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic, 606 U.S. --- (2025).   \n49.  Pursuant to Social Security Act sections 1128 and 1156, Defendants have limited \nauthority to determine which providers may participate in Medicaid programs as qualified \nproviders, mainly based on their commission of crimes or other violations of federal law.  \nNeither section authorizes HHS to exclude providers from participation in Medicaid based solely \non their provision of abortions—or any type of care—outside the Medicaid program.  \n50.  If HHS seeks to exclude a provider based on these sections, it must provide \nspecific process to the provider as set forth in the Social Security Act and implementing \nregulations.  Such process includes but is not limited to issuance of a Notice of Intent to Exclude \nand an opportunity to respond to and challenge any determinations by HHS.  Any exclusion may \nbe appealed to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and decisions by an ALJ may be appealed to \nthe HHS Departmental Appeals Board.  42 C.F.R. § 1001.2007(c). \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 13 of 83\n51.  Each state must develop a process by which providers may enroll in Medicaid as \ncovered or participating providers, and through which each state approves or rejects providers \nfor enrollment.  See 42 C.F.R. § 455.410.  Such processes must follow all screening and \ncategorization procedures outlined in the regulations.  \n52.  Beyond Congress’s decision to exclude providers based on commission of crimes \nor other violations of federal law outlined in Social Security Act sections 1128 and 1156, \nCongress has never conditioned Medicaid funding on the exclusion of specific providers.  \n53.  Indeed, to the contrary, Congress guarantees Medicaid beneficiaries their free \nchoice of provider as set forth in the plain text of Social Security Act.  42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(23); \nsee also 42 C.F.R. § 431.51 (“Free Choice of Providers”).  This longstanding provision of the \nMedicaid program has existed for nearly 60 years. \n54.  And CMS has reiterated that this provision prohibits states from refusing to \nreimburse providers of family planning services because of their conduct outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.6  States are also required to inform beneficiaries of their right to a free choice of \nprovider for family planning services.  See id. \n55.  In general, to access federal matching Medicaid funds, states provide estimates of \ntheir Medicaid expenses for each financial quarter to CMS.7  CMS in turn provides matching \nfederal funds at the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), which is the percentage of \n \n6 See Ctr. for Medicaid, CHIP & Survey & Certification, CMCS Informational Bulletin \n(June 1, 2011), https://downloads.cms.gov/cmsgov/archived-\ndownloads/CMCSBulletins/downloads/6-1-11-Info-Bulletin.pdf (“longstanding federal law” \nprohibits states from excluding providers from Medicaid because they provide abortions outside \nof the Medicaid program, without using federal dollars); see also Letter from Vikki Wachino, \nDirector of Center for Medicaid & CHIP Services, to State Health Officials, Re: Medicaid \nFamily Planning Services and Supplies (June 14, 2016), https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-\npolicy-guidance/downloads/sho16008.pdf.  \n7 U.S. Gov.

State Medicaid Programs \n56.  The Plaintiff States participate in federal Medicaid programs.  Access to health \ninsurance through Medicaid increases utilization of preventative healthcare, limits the spread of \ncommunicable illnesses, and minimizes financial burdens on healthcare providers. For example, \nMedicaid coverage for children enhances health in childhood and adulthood and improves \neducational outcomes, all of which contribute to higher rates of employment and earnings as \nadults.12  These and other benefits lead to immediate and long-term health improvements for \nPlaintiff States’ residents, and lower healthcare costs incurred by the Plaintiff States through \ntheir Medicaid programs.  \n57.  California:  Medi-Cal is California’s Medicaid program.  The California \nDepartment of Health Care Services (DHCS) manages Medi-Cal and is responsible for provider \nenrollment, claims processing, program design, and responding to the public.  Medi-Cal covers \n \n8 Id.  \n9 Id. at 3. \n10 Id. at 4. \n11 Id.  \n12 See Rose C. Chu, et al., Issue Brief: Medicaid: The Health and Economic Benefits of \nExpanding Eligibility (Issue Brief HB-2024-18), ASPE.HHS.gov (Sept. 2024), \nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/effbde36dd9852a49d10e66e4a4ee333/medicai\nd-health-economic-benefits.pdf  \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 15 of 83\nalmost 15 million Californians—over a third of California’s population.  Most Medi-Cal \nenrollees are covered though a state contract with a managed care plan.  California’s FMAP is 50 \npercent for most services and for most enrollees, while certain services and enrollees, including \nfamily planning services, are eligible for an FMAP of up to 90 percent.  Overall, federal funds \ncover around 60 percent of total Medi-Cal program expenditures.  \n58.  The Medi-Cal program provides coverage for comprehensive sexual and \nreproductive health services, covering all health care services required by federal law as well as \nmany optional benefits that are eligible for federal matching funds.  For beneficiaries who access \ncare through a managed care plan, sexual and reproductive health care services, including for \nfamily planning and abortion, are available both in- and out-of-network as sensitive services.    \nCalifornia also provides coverage using state-only funds for certain health care services that are \nnot eligible for federal funds, including abortion, and for certain populations whose care is not \neligible for federal matching funds. \n59.  This scope of coverage is particularly important to California due to the \ncharacteristics of its residents who are enrolled in Medi-Cal.  Of those covered by Medi-Cal, \n36.6 percent are 20 years of age or younger.  Nearly 35 percent (34.3 percent) of Medi-Cal \nenrollees are a part of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) expansion of Medicaid coverage to \nadults between the ages of 19 and 64 years of age who have incomes up to 138 percent of the \nfederal poverty limit.  In short, a significant percentage of California Medi-Cal recipients are in \nage brackets that need access to full-scope reproductive healthcare.  To provide that coverage, \nCalifornia has a comprehensive family planning services program, the Family Planning, Access, \nCare, and Treatment Program (Family PACT or FPACT).  The federal government provides \n77.5 percent of FPACT’s funding.  FPACT provides coverage for contraceptive and family \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 16 of 83\nplanning-related services, along with client-entered health education and counseling, at no cost \nto Californians of reproductive age with low incomes.  The FPACT Program is designed to assist \nindividuals who have a medical necessity for family planning services, so that they can establish \nthe timing, number, and spacing of their children, and maintain optimal reproductive health.  \nFPACT serves over 600,000 income-eligible people of childbearing age.  About 70 percent of \nhealthcare services reimbursed by FPACT are provided by California-based Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers.   \n60.  Colorado:  Colorado’s Medicaid program is Health First Colorado, which is \nadministered by the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing.  Health First \nColorado covers individuals up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), families up to \n142 percent of the FPL, and pregnant persons up to 195 percent of FPL.  Health First Colorado \nhas approximately 1.2 million members.  Colorado also offers Child Health Plan Plus (CHP+), \nwhich provides comprehensive health care benefits to uninsured children up to age 19 and \npregnant people who do not qualify for Medicaid and meet income criteria (up to 260 percent of \nthe FPL).  As of January 2025, over 93,000 children and pregnant people were covered by \nCHP+. \n61.  Both Health First Colorado and CHP+ are jointly funded by the federal \ngovernment and Colorado state government, at different rates depending on the individual and \npopulation.  On average, about 60 percent of all funding for Colorado Department of Health \nCare Policy and Financing’s budget, including Health First Colorado, CHP+, other programs and \nadministration comes in the form of federal matching funds. \n62.  In Fiscal Year 2024, Colorado’s total expenditures for Health First Colorado and \nCHP+ were approximately $15.1 billion total funds, including $4.5 billion general State funds. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 17 of 83\n63.  Connecticut:  The state program in Connecticut, HUSKY Health, provides \ncomprehensive health coverage to all qualifying Connecticut residents and includes \nConnecticut’s partially federally funded Medicaid and CHIP programs.  HUSKY Connecticut \nprovides free or low-cost coverage to approximately 945,000 children, parents and relative \ncaregivers, pregnant women, disabled individuals, and some single individuals with lower \nincomes.   \n64.  The rate of federal funding for individuals enrolled in either Medicaid or CHIP \nthrough HUSKY varies.  The federal match rate for Medicaid is normally 50 percent but for \ncertain participant populations may be as high as 90 percent.  In Fiscal Year 2024, Connecticut’s \ntotal expenditures for federal Medicaid and CHIP were approximately $ 8.3 billion, which was \n23.6 percent of total state expenditures.  \n65.  Connecticut’s Department of Social Services (DSS) is Connecticut’s single state \nMedicaid agency and functions as one of the largest health coverage providers in Connecticut.  It \nis a leader in ensuring Connecticut residents have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare, \nand it is committed to whole-person care, integrating physical and behavioral health services for \nbetter results and healthier communities in Connecticut.  DSS provides healthcare for over 1 \nmillion state residents annually through HUSKY.  DSS also administers some state funded \nhealthcare programs, including the State HUSKY program for certain individuals who are \nineligible for Medicaid, and fully state funds certain healthcare services, including abortion.  \n66.  Delaware:  Delaware administers two programs pursuant to the federally funded \nMedicaid program: Diamond State Health Plan (DSHP) and Diamond State Health Plan Plus \n(DSHP+).  In state fiscal year 2026, approximately 25 percent of the Delaware’s population was \ncovered under Medicaid.  Delaware funds 100 percent of the cost of abortion care for \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 18 of 83\nparticipants of the Delaware Medicaid program.  Except for few Hyde Amendment cases, \nabortion care is always provided on a fee-for-service basis and is billed and paid separately from \nother covered and federally funded health care services. \n67.  Most family planning services in Delaware billed to Medicaid are eligible for a 90 \npercent federal match rate.  This means that for those medical exams, procedures, or other \nservices for those covered by Delaware’s Medicaid program, the federal government pays 90 \npercent, and the state pays the remainder.  Some reproductive healthcare services are not eligible \nfor the 90 percent match rate, such as sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment.  Those \nservices are eligible for a federal match rate of approximately 60 percent.   \n68.  District of Columbia:  District of Columbia Medicaid (DC Medicaid) is a joint \nfederal-state health insurance program that provides health care coverage to low-income and \ndisabled adults, children and families.  DC Medicaid covers various family planning services, \nincluding those provided at the District’s Planned Parenthood provider.  To date in fiscal year \n2025, DC Medicaid and DC Medicaid Managed Care Organizations have provided over \n$500,000 in reimbursements to the District’s Planned Parenthood provider. \n69.  Hawaiʻi:  Hawaiʻi’s Medicaid program, Med-QUEST, is administered by the \nMed-QUEST Division of the Department of Human Services.  Med-QUEST provides low-\nincome individuals with medical assistance for comprehensive healthcare coverage and access to \naffordable, integrated, and high-quality healthcare at no or low cost.  Med-QUEST provides \ncoverage for reproductive health care, including family planning services, maternity and \nnewborn care, pregnancy-related services, contraceptives, and the diagnosis and treatment of \nsexually transmitted diseases.  Med-QUEST also covers various cancer screenings, including \nbreast, cervical, and prostate cancer screening.  Currently, about 415,000 people are enrolled in \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 19 of 83\nMed-QUEST.  This constitutes nearly 1/3 of Hawaiʻi’s population.  Of those enrolled, about \n112,000 people are between the ages of 20 to 39 years old, the age bracket most likely to require \nreproductive health services.  In fiscal year 2024, the total Medicaid spending in Hawaiʻi was \njust over $3 billion, of which 65 percent was paid by the federal government. \n70.  Illinois:  The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (IHFS) is \nresponsible for administering Illinois’s Medical Assistance Program, which covers health care \nfor individuals who meet eligibility requirements for the program.  Medicaid is a component of \nthis program, and Illinois healthcare providers enroll in the Medical Assistance Program to serve \nIllinois Medicaid customers.  At the end of state fiscal year 2024, IFHS, through the Illinois \nMedical Assistance Program, was covering over 3.4 million eligible individuals across the State \nof Illinois. This includes comprehensive coverage for nearly 1.5 million children, and 1.6 million \nadults between the ages of 19 and 65.  As of April 1, 2025, the Illinois Medical Assistance \nProgram serves over 800,000 women ages 15 to 49.  The federal funds Illinois receives to \nadminister Medicaid are critical to ensuring that the program can continue to deliver essential \nhealthcare services. \n71.  Maine:  MaineCare is the state of Maine’s Medicaid program.  MaineCare covers \nmedically necessary services, including primary care visits, family planning services, \nprescription medications, and behavioral health.  MaineCare plays a critically important role in \nensuring that rural Mainers have access to care.  Adults and children living in rural areas, \nincluding most of Maine, are more likely to rely on MaineCare or than adults and children who \nlive in urban areas.  Indeed, more than half of Medicaid enrollees in Maine live in rural areas. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 20 of 83\n72.  Maryland:  As of May 2025, Maryland’s Medicaid Program, Maryland \nMedicaid, covered 1,522,680 people, accounting for 25 percent of the state’s population. \nMaryland Medicaid is administered by the Maryland Department of Health. \n73.  Massachusetts:  In Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health \nand Human Services (EOHHS) administers the Medicaid program and CHIP through a single \nprogram called MassHealth, pursuant to federal law and regulations as well as the terms of \nfederally approved State Plans and a Section 1115 Demonstration Project.  EOHHS is the single \nstate agency responsible for administering MassHealth  \n74.  MassHealth provides low-income individuals with comprehensive healthcare \ncoverage and access to affordable, integrated, high-quality healthcare at no or low cost. \nMassHealth’s coverage includes medical, dental, mental health and substance use treatment, \nlong-term services and supports, and long-term care.  MassHealth’s mission is to improve the \nhealth outcomes of its members and their families through services which sustainably and \nequitably promote health, well-being, independence, and quality of life.  MassHealth insures \napproximately 2 million people, including close to 500,000 people of childbearing age, over \n720,000 children, and approximately 525,000 seniors and people with disabilities.  Among the \nbroad array of services it covers for its members, MassHealth covers comprehensivesexual and \n \nreproductive health care services, including family planning, cancer and STI screenings, and \ncritical preventative care. \n75.  The costs of Medicaid and CHIP services provided through MassHealth are \nshared between the state and federal government at an FMAP that varies, by service and by \nmember type, between 50 percent and 90 percent, with an average of 55 percent FMAP overall. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 21 of 83\n76.  Michigan:  The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) \nadministers Michigan’s Medicaid program—a comprehensive healthcare coverage program for \nlow-income Michiganders.  MDHHS also administers Michigan’s Medicaid expansion program, \nHealthy Michigan Plan (HMP).  Together, Michigan’s Medicaid program and HMP are referred \nto as “Michigan Medicaid.”  In addition to Michigan Medicaid, MDHHS administers CHIP, \nknown in Michigan as “MIChild.”  MIChild provides healthcare coverage to children in families \nthat make too much to be eligible for Medicaid, but too little to afford private care.  Children \nenrolled in MIChild are considered Medicaid beneficiaries and are entitled to all Medicaid \ncovered services. \n77.  Michigan Medicaid provides enrollees with access to affordable, integrated, high-\nquality healthcare at little to no cost.  Coverage includes medical, dental, mental health, \nsubstance use disorder treatment, long-term care, family planning services, and family-planning-\nrelated services.  Michigan Medicaid and MIChild are authorized and funded in part through a \nfederal-state partnership.  MDHHS administers the programs pursuant to broad federal \nrequirements, as well as the terms of its CMS-approved State Plan.  Most Michigan Medicaid \nand MIChild enrollees are eligible for coverage paid for by joint federal and state funding.  \nMichigan draws 65.13 percent FMAP for its Medicaid program, 90 percent FMAP for HMP, and \n75.59 percent FMAP for MIChild.  Family planning services, however, are eligible for an \nenhanced FMAP of 90 percent.  \n78.  Michigan Medicaid and MIChild insure approximately 2.6 million people, \nincluding over 1 million children—almost half of Michigan’s children.  This amounts to more \nthan 25 percent of Michigan’s population.  Of this, over 1.8 million enrollees on average are \neligible for reproductive healthcare services.  Those who do not qualify for Michigan Medicaid \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 22 of 83\nor MIChild may still obtain coverage for family planning services through Michigan’s Plan First \nprogram.  Plan First is a limited Medicaid benefit that covers a broad range of family planning \nservices, including annual wellness exams, contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing \nand treatment, vaccines, pregnancy testing and counseling, and more.  Plan First enrollees may \nobtain covered family planning services from any qualified Medicaid-enrolled provider.  On \naverage, Plan First serves over 130,000 Michiganders.  Michigan draws the enhanced 90 percent \nFMAP for services provided to individuals enrolled in Plan First. \n79.  In the first six months of fiscal year 2025, Michigan’s Medicaid program received \n212,074 claims for reproductive healthcare services and paid $17,534,343 in reimbursements. \nWith limited exception—consistent with the federal Hyde Amendment and Michigan’s state-law \ncounterpart—Michigan’s Medicaid programs do not provide coverage for abortion care. \n80.  Minnesota:  Minnesota’s Medicaid program, Medical Assistance, provides low-\nincome individuals with comprehensive healthcare coverage and access to affordable, integrated, \nhigh-quality healthcare at no or low cost.  The Minnesota Department of Human Services \n(MDHS), through its Health Care Administration, is responsible for administering Medical \nAssistance. MDHS is responsible for provider enrollment, claims processing, program design, \nand responding to the public.  Today, Medical Assistance provides health coverage for more than \n1.2 million Minnesotans, or approximately one in every five state residents. \n81.  Medical Assistance in Minnesota is a federal-state partnership, wherein the costs \nof services, including sexual and reproductive health services, provided through Medical \nAssistance are shared between the state and federal government.  The rate of federal funding for \nindividuals enrolled in Medicaid through Medical Assistance varies between 50 percent and 90 \npercent.  In state fiscal year 2025, total Medical Assistance payments in Minnesota are projected \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 23 of 83\nto exceed $20 billion. Of that amount, 57 percent is paid by the federal government, 42 percent \nis paid by the state, and 1 percent is paid by other entities including counties and school districts.  \nThe estimated cost to the State of Minnesota of fully covering the services offered by Planned \nParenthood is approximately $9 million. \n82.  Nevada:  Nevada Medicaid is funded from a combination of state and federal \nsources to provide quality health care coverage to low-income families, Supplemental Security \nIncome (SSI) recipients, certain Medicare beneficiaries, and recipients of adoption assistance, \nfoster care and some children aging out of foster care.  Currently, Nevada’s FMAP is about 60 \npercent. \n83.  The Division of Nevada Medicaid, Nevada Health Authority administers the \nMedicaid program and the Nevada Check Up (NCU) program, Nevada's version of CHIP.  NCU \nprovides health care benefits to uninsured children from low-income families who are not \neligible for Medicaid but whose family income is at or below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty \nLevel.  Medicaid eligibility is currently determined by the Division of Social Services, formerly \nthe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services.  Approximately, 920,547 people are currently \nenrolled in Nevada Medicaid. \n84.  New Jersey:  NJ FamilyCare is a federal- and state-funded health insurance \nprogram created to help qualified New Jersey residents of any age access affordable health \ninsurance.  NJ FamilyCare includes, but is not limited to, Medicaid and CHIP, which are funded \nby both the federal government and the State.  NJ FamilyCare facilitates access to free doctor \nvisits, prescriptions, vision, dental care, mental health, substance use services, and \nhospitalizations for qualified NJ residents of any age.  Currently more than 1.8 million people, or \napproximately 19.8 percent of New Jersey’s population, are enrolled in NJ FamilyCare.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 24 of 83\n85.  NJ FamilyCare also administers the Plan First Program, which provides family \nplanning services to individuals who do not have access to such services through insurance.  The \nPlan First Program covers many family planning needs, including, but not limited to, birth \ncontrol; family planning counseling; pregnancy tests; condoms; family planning lab tests; and \nvasectomies for men 21 years of age or older.  Typical enrollees in Plan First are low income but \nare ineligible for NJ FamilyCare.  \n86.  New Mexico:  New Mexico’s Medicaid program, which is administered by the \nstate Health Care Authority (HCA), provides healthcare coverage for approximately 840,000 \nNew Mexicans, over 40 percent of the state population.  In New Mexico, full-scope Medicaid \ngives beneficiaries access to primary and preventive care, dental health care, inpatient and \noutpatient hospital treatment, prescription drugs, behavioral health care, home health care, and \nother vital services.   \n87.  In addition, New Mexico funds more limited scope healthcare programs that offer \nmore targeted services to specific populations.  For example, New Mexico provides access to \nfamily planning services, including contraceptives and reproductive health exams, under the \nstate’s Family Planning Program; and helps low-income New Mexicans who qualify for \nMedicare with out-of-pocket costs, such as premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance.  \n88.  New York:  New York’s Medicaid program, which is overseen by New York \nDepartment of Health (DOH), provides comprehensive health coverage to more than 7 million \nNew Yorkers (as of December 2023).  Medicaid pays for a wide range of services, depending on \nthe enrollee’s age, financial circumstances, family situation, or living arrangements through a \nlarge network of health care providers. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 25 of 83\n89.  The costs of services, including sexual and reproductive health services, provided \nthrough New York’s Medicaid programs, are shared between the state and federal government, \nwith a FMAP that varies but is 50 percent for most services and up to 90 percent for defined \nFamily Planning services.  Covered services include, sexual and reproductive health care \nservices, including for family planning/contraception, sexually transmitted infection screenings, \ndiagnosis and treatment and primary and preventative health care.  Abortion is 0% federally \nfunded.  \n90.  Many New Yorkers have a personal need for sexual and reproductive health \nservices.  In 2022, the most recent year where data are available, there were 3,881,117 females \nof childbearing age (15 to 44 years old) in the state, and 29.6% were under 20 years old.   \nWhether enrolled in Medicaid, or any non-Medicaid health plan, New Yorkers need access to \nsexual and reproductive health services across our state. \n91.  In 2023, the most recent year for which complete data are available, \napproximately 88,500 individual Medicaid enrollees sought care at Planned Parenthood \nmembers across the state, with approximately 156,000 claims for services provided to Medicaid \nmembers processed.   \n92.  New York provides sexual and reproductive health service coverage to Medicaid-\neligible individuals and an expanded population through its Family Planning Benefit Program \n(FPBP), a public health insurance program for New Yorkers who need family planning services \nonly.  FPBP is intended to increase access to confidential family planning services and to enable \nteens, women, and men of childbearing age to prevent and/or reduce the incidence of unintended \npregnancies.  Individuals may be eligible if they meet residential, citizenship, and income \nrequirements, and are not already enrolled in Medicaid. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 26 of 83\n93.  North Carolina:  North Carolina’s Medicaid program provides affordable health \ncoverage to more than 3 million North Carolinians.  North Carolina’s Medicaid program is \njointly funded at the state and federal level and is administered by the North Carolina \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). \n94.  Oregon:  The Oregon Health Plan (OHP) is Oregon’s Medicaid program.  The \nOregon Health Authority (OHA) administers OHP.  About 1.4 million Oregonians—over one-\nthird of the population—have Medicaid coverage through OHP.  OHP provides comprehensive \nmedical coverage for eligible individuals.  Eligibility is based on income and residency \nrequirements.  Generally, to be eligible for OHP, adults must be residents of Oregon and have \nhousehold income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level.  Most OHP members \naccess health care through a Coordinated Care Organization. \n95.  Among other services, OHP covers comprehensive family planning and \nreproductive health care services, including annual wellness visits, contraception, pregnancy \ntesting, prenatal care, sexually transmitted infection testing, and voluntary sterilization.  The cost \nof care for all OHP members is shared between the federal government and Oregon.  Most \nfamily planning services billed to Medicaid are eligible for a federal match rate of 90 percent. \nFor other services that do not qualify for that match rate, such as STI testing, the base federal \nmatch rate applies, which is under 60 percent.  Oregon provides coverage to OHP members \nusing state-only funds for certain services and populations that are not eligible for coverage \nunder Medicaid.  Abortion care is one example.  Under Oregon law, individuals have a \nfundamental right to make decisions about their reproductive health care, including whether to \nkeep or terminate a pregnancy.  Or. Rev. Stat. § 435.210.  Federal funds are not used for any \nabortion care services in Oregon. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 27 of 83\n96.  In addition to OHP, Oregon operates a second Medicaid program called Oregon \nContraceptiveCare (CCare).  CCare is a section 1115 family planning Medicaid demonstration \nwaiver that makes family planning services available to individuals who are not enrolled in \nOHP.  Individuals with incomes up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for \ncoverage under CCare.  CCare is provided through a network of providers, each of which is \ncertified by the Oregon Health Authority’s Reproductive Health Program.  Individuals enrolled \nin CCare may access care from any CCare provider, and they may enroll in CCare at the \nprovider clinic at the time of an appointment.  CCare covers office visits for contraceptive \nmanagement services, STI screening services in the context of contraceptive visits, and \ncontraceptive devices and supplies.  The federal match rate for CCare services is 90 percent.  In \nstate fiscal year 2025, CCare reimbursed 14,081 family planning visits or encounters provided to \n8,779 unique Oregon residents. \n97.  Pennsylvania:  In Pennsylvania, Medicaid is known as Medical Assistance, or \nMA.  As of May 2025, MA covers 2,982,975 million Pennsylvanians.  Most MA enrollees are \ncovered though a state agreement with a managed care plan.  The Pennsylvania Department of \nHuman Services manages the Medical Assistance program and is responsible for provider \nenrollment, claims processing, program design, and responding to the public.  For beneficiaries \nwho access care through a managed care plan, sexual and reproductive health care services, \nincluding family planning services, are available both in- and out-of-network as sensitive \nservices.  Planned Parenthood facilities are a significant provider of sexual and reproductive \nhealth care services to Pennsylvanians through MA. \n98.  Consistent with the federal-state partnership structure of Medicaid, the cost of \ncare under the MA program is shared between Pennsylvania and the federal government.  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 28 of 83\nPennsylvania’s FMAP is 55.09 percent for most services and for most enrollees, while certain \nservices, including family planning services, are eligible for an FMAP of up to 90 percent. \n99.  The MA program provides coverage for comprehensive sexual and reproductive \nhealth services, covering all health care services required by federal law as well as certain \noptional benefits that are eligible for federal matching funds.  This scope of coverage is \nparticularly important to Pennsylvania due to the characteristics of its residents who are enrolled \nin MA.  Of those covered by MA, as of May 2025, 1,733,542 individuals are 20 years of age or \nyounger.  Nearly 750,000 MA enrollees are part of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of \nMedicaid coverage to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 years of age who have incomes up to \n138% of the Federal Poverty Limit.  In short, a significant percentage of MA recipients are in \nage brackets that need access to full-scope reproductive healthcare. \n100.  Pennsylvania also provides coverage through the state plan family planning \noption afforded by section 2303 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. No. \n111-148), known as the Family Planning Services program, or FPS.  FPS provides coverage of \nfamily planning and certain family planning-related services, pharmaceuticals and supplies at no \ncost to Pennsylvanians of reproductive age who are not otherwise eligible for MA and have \nincome at or below 215 percent of the Federal Poverty Limit and who are not pregnant.  Family \nplanning-related services are medical diagnosis and treatment services provided in a family \nplanning setting as part of, or as follow-up to, a family planning visit and includes services for \nthe prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.  FPS is designed to assist \nindividuals who have a medical necessity for family planning services, so that they can establish \nthe timing, number, and spacing of their children, and maintain optimal reproductive health. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 29 of 83\nPlanned Parenthood facilities are a significant provider of services to Pennsylvanians as part of \nthe FPS program. \n101.  Rhode Island:  Nearly one-third of all Rhode Islanders—more than 300,000 \npeople—are covered by Rhode Island’s Medicaid program. Medicaid provides critical health \ninsurance coverage for low-income Rhode Island families with children, pregnant women, older \nadults (age 65 and over) and people with disabilities and special needs who otherwise might not \nbe able to pay for or obtain access to affordable health care.  The Medicaid program in Rhode \nIsland is administered by the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services. \n102.  Vermont:  Vermont’s Department of Vermont Health Access (DVHA) is \nresponsible for administering Vermont’s Medicaid program.  Vermont Medicaid provides low-\nincome individuals with comprehensive healthcare coverage and access to affordable, integrated, \nhigh-quality healthcare at no or low cost.  Vermont Medicaid coverage includes coverage for \nreproductive health and preventative services. \n103.  DVHA is one of the largest healthcare payers in Vermont with Medicaid covering \n32 percent of the state’s population. In total Vermont Medicaid insures approximately 200,000 \npeople.  Vermont Medicaid is authorized and funded in part through the Medicaid federal-state \npartnership.  Vermont administers Vermont Medicaid pursuant to broad federal requirements as \nwell as the terms of its CMS-approved State Plan, and its 1115 Global Commitment \nDemonstration waiver approved by CMS. \n104.  In state fiscal year 2024, Vermont’s total expenditures for federal Medicaid and \nCHIP were approximately $ 2.4 billion, accounting for approximately 27 percent of the Vermont \nstate budget.  In state fiscal year 2024, total federal participation accounted for approximately 62 \npercent of overall Medicaid spending in Vermont. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 30 of 83\n105.  Washington:  Apple Health is the umbrella term in Washington for Medicaid and \nCHIP.  Apple Health provides free or low-cost health insurance coverage to qualifying \nindividuals and families, including children, pregnant women, adults, seniors, and individuals \nwith disabilities.  The Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA) is responsible for \nadministering Medicaid, which HCA does under its CMS-approved State Plan.  HCA is the \nlargest healthcare purchaser in Washington, as Medicaid and other Apple Health programs cover \nabout 20 percent of the state’s population.  In total, Medicaid insures approximately 1.9 million \npeople including approximately 850,000 children.  In 26 of Washington’s 39 counties, more than \nhalf of all children are covered by Medicaid.  Most Apple Health enrollees are eligible for \ncoverage paid for by joint federal and state funding.  The state uses federal dollars to pay for a \nsignificant portion of its Apple Health costs – approximately 67 percent, with the state covering \nthe remaining costs. \n106.  Wisconsin:  Wisconsin has multiple state Medicaid programs that help nearly 1.3 \nmillion Wisconsin residents obtain quality healthcare.13  The most common Wisconsin state \nMedicaid program is BadgerCare Plus.  Generally, federal funds account for roughly 60 percent \nof the funding for services covered by Wisconsin’s Medicaid programs.  Federal funding, \nhowever, accounts for roughly 90 percent of Wisconsin’s Medicaid coverage for family planning \nservices.  In fiscal year 2023, Wisconsin’s state spending on its Medicaid programs amounted to \nover $3 billion.   \n107.  The Wisconsin Department of Health Services is responsible for administering \nWisconsin’s Medicaid programs.

Stat. § 49.46(2)(a)4.f.  \n108.  Separate from its responsibility for administering Wisconsin’s Medicaid \nprograms, Wisconsin law also requires the Department of Health Services to maintain a maternal \nand child health program that promotes the reproductive health of individuals and the growth, \ndevelopment, health and safety of children.  Wis. Stat. § 253.02(2).  Wisconsin law further \nrequires the Department to submit a state plan for maternal and child health services to federal \nauthorities that is designed to secure the maximum amount of federal aid which can be secured \nfor Wisconsin.  Wis. Stat. § 253.03. \nII.  THE DEFUND PROVISION IN THE 2025 BUDGET BILL  \n109.  On May 22, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a massive budget \nbill, H.R. 1, referred to as the “Big Beautiful Bill” and the “budget reconciliation bill” \n(hereinafter, “budget bill”).  On July 1, 2025, the Senate passed a modified version of the budget \nbill, which the House of Representatives subsequently adopted.  On July 4, 2025, President \nTrump signed the budget bill. \n110.  The budget bill was passed during the reconciliation process, in which Congress \ncan bypass the Senate’s typical 60-vote supermajority requirement, allowing the reconciliation \nbill to be passed with a simple majority in the Senate.  Provisions related only to spending or \nrevenue changes are allowed in a reconciliation bill. \n111.  The Defund Provision, which is included in the budget bill, bars federal Medicaid \nfunds from being “used to make payments” to a “prohibited entity” “for items and services \nfurnished during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act [i.e., July \n4, 2025].”  Pub. L. No. 119-21, § 44126, 138 Stat. 482 (2025).  Despite prohibiting payments \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 32 of 83\nstarting on July 4, 2025, the Defund Provision applies only to entities that meet the statutory \ndefinition of “prohibited entities” “as of the first day of the first quarter beginning after the date \nof enactment of this Act,” i.e., October 1, 2025. \n112.   The Defund Provision defines a “prohibited entity” as an entity, “including its \naffiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and clinics,” that meets four criteria (Prohibited Entity(ies)):   \na.  It “provides for abortions,” other than abortions in the case of rape or \nincest or when the woman’s life is in danger;  \nb.  It “is an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \nRevenue Code . . . and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such \nCode”; \nc.  It “is an essential community provider described in” 45 C.F.R. § 156.235 \n“that is primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive \nhealth, and related medical care;” and \nd.  “for which the total amount of Federal and State expenditures under the \nMedicaid program . . . in fiscal year 2023 made directly, or by a covered \norganization, to the entity or to any affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, or \nclinics of the entity, or made to the entity or to any affiliates, subsidiaries, \nsuccessors, or clinics of the entity as part of a nationwide health care \nprovider network, exceeded $800,000.”  \n113.  In sum, the Defund Provision prohibits the use of any federal Medicaid funds to \nreimburse for care and services provided by Prohibited Entities—regardless of whether the \nparticular care provided, such as cancer and STI screening, would otherwise be covered by \nMedicaid. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 33 of 83\nIII.  THE DEFUND PROVISION IMPERMISSIBLY TARGETS PLANNED PARENTHOOD \nHEALTH CENTERS \n114.  The Defund Provision specifically targets PPFA and the Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers for their political advocacy in support of abortion rights.  By virtue of its four \ncriteria, the Defund Provision applies to the overwhelming majority of Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers but excludes from its scope almost all other abortion providers.  In fact, according \nto the federal government, the Defund Provision purportedly may apply to all Planned \nParenthood member health centers in the country, regardless of whether they individually \nreceived more than $800,000 from Medicaid in fiscal year 2023 or provide abortion care, simply \nbecause they are associated with PPFA.14   \n115.  The facts show that the Defund Provision was aimed at PPFA and the Planned \nParenthood health centers, due to their advocacy for abortion rights and access:  \na.  In 2015, then candidate-Trump stated that he would support “get[ting] rid \nof Planned Parenthood money.”15  That same year, he stated that he was \n“not supporting Planned Parenthood” and would be “totally opposed to \nfunding” Planned Parenthood as long as they provided abortion care.16  A \nfew months later, he stated that he “would defund [Planned parenthood] as \nlong as they’re doing abortion.”17  \nb.  In 2016, Trump stated that he would “defund” Planned Parenthood \n“because [he’s] pro-life.”18  That same year, he stated that he was \n“committed to . . . [d]efunding Planned Parenthood as long as they \ncontinue to perform abortions.”19  \nc.  In 2017, President Trump again called for the “Defunding” of Planned \nParenthood.20  Heeding that call, Congress tried (but failed) to pass \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 34 of 83\nlegislation nearly identical to the Defund Provision on multiple occasions.  \nSee American Health Care Act of 2017, H.R. 1628, 115th Cong. (2017); \nS. Amend. 267, 1115th Cong. (2017).  The proposed provisions in those \nbills did not explicitly name Planned Parenthood, but during \nCongressional debates several Congressional members made clear that \nPPFA and its health centers were the target, with Representative Matt \nGaetz “implor[ing] [his] conservative colleagues to vote for his bill” \nbecause it would “defund[] Planned Parenthood,”21 and Representative \nKevin Brady stating, “I am proud to defund Planned Parenthood once and \nfor all.”22  \n \n14 See Defs.’ Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for a Prelim.

With President Trump heading back into office, House Speaker Johnson \nconfirmed in 2024 that “defunding” Planned Parenthood continued to be a \npriority.24  He stated that he was planning to “axe” funding for Planned \nParenthood, and then stated that the “one big beautiful bill . . . is going to \nredirect funds away from Big Abortion.”25  \ng.

As these statements demonstrate, the passage of the Defund Provision was the \nculmination of a years-long campaign to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood health \ncenters because of the centers’ and PPFA’s unique role with regard to abortion rights and access \nacross the country.   \n117.  What this repeated messaging ignores is that Planned Parenthood health centers \ndo not have as their “primary purpose” to “do abortions”:  in 2023, Planned Parenthood health \ncenters provided 9,450,743 services, less than 5 percent of which were abortion services \n(402,230 abortion services).29 \n118.  The perception that Planned Parenthood health centers “primarily” exist to \nprovide abortion care stems from PPFA’s and the Planned Parenthood health centers’ public \nsupport for and advocacy to advance the right to obtain abortion care.  Through the Defund \nProvision, Congress and the President seek to punish that support and advocacy by starving \nPlanned Parenthood health centers of funding for the vast majority of the healthcare services that \nthey provide, and that Medicaid typically covers, such as STI testing and treatment, \ncontraceptive services, cancer screenings, and other reproductive, non-abortion healthcare.   \n119.  In fact, the specific and narrow criteria to qualify as a “prohibited entity” under \nthe Defund Provision reveals that the purpose is to withhold essential federal funds from just \nPlanned Parenthood health clinics, with only a few additional clinics swept in as cover to avoid \n \n27 Oriana González, The Mission to Defund Planned Parenthood Likely Won’t Make It \nInto Reconciliation, NOTUS (Feb. 7, 2025), https://www.notus.org/policy/republicans-\nreconciliation-planned-parenthood.  \n28 171 Cong. Rec. 255 (2025) (statement of Rep. Christopher Smith). \n29 Planned Parenthood Fed’n of America, Inc., A Force for Hope: Annual Report 2023-\n2024 23 (2024) (hereinafter 2023-2024 PPFA Annual Report). \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 37 of 83\nsurvive the Senate’s reconciliation procedure.  Only two entities that are not Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers have been publicly announced as also purportedly falling within the “prohibited \nentities” definition if they continue to provide abortion care on October 1, 2025: Maine Family \nPlanning in Maine, and Health Imperatives in Massachusetts.  As discussed herein, however, it is \nunclear whether any final determination by CMS is definitive, or whether the final determination \nfalls to the states.  \n120.  The Defund Provision retaliates against the Planned Parenthood health centers for \ntheir support for and advocacy to advance reproductive rights, including abortion care.  \nAccordingly, the Defund Provision violates the First Amendment’s protection for freedom of \nspeech.  The Defund Provision also violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection \nguarantees, which prohibit government retaliation for the exercise of constitutional rights.   \n121.  The Defund Provision also punishes the Planned Parenthood health centers’ \nassociations with each other and with PPFA, in violation of the First Amendment’s protections \nfor associational rights.  Using language that PPFA uses to describe its relationship with its \nmember health centers, the Defund Provision sweeps any “affiliate” of a Prohibited Entity into \nthe definition of “prohibited entity,” even if that affiliated entity does not independently qualify \nunder the Defund Provision.  Given the narrow scope of the Defund Provision, and the evidence \nshowing that PPFA and its members are the clear target of the legislation, the Defund Provision \neffectively punishes PPFA and its members for associating with each other.  Given that their \nassociation stems from their outspoken support and advocacy for abortion rights, that affiliation \nis expressive.  As such, the Defund Provision infringes on the free association rights guaranteed \nby the First Amendment. \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 38 of 83\n122.  Because the Defund Provision punishes the Planned Parenthood health centers \nwith a severe consequence, namely full-scale ineligibility for federal Medicaid reimbursement, \nwithout the protections of a trial and concomitant due process, the Defund Provision also \nviolates Article I’s prohibition on bills of attainder.     \n123.  As the history of the Defund Provision reveals, the incidental inclusion of other \nhealth centers in the “prohibited entity” definition is the result only of Congress’s attempt to \novercome its own procedural hurdles to target the Planned Parenthood health centers.  For \nexample, in 2017, Congress almost passed a nearly identical bill, H.R. 1628, except that the \nprohibition would apply only to a network of health centers who collectively received $350 \nmillion from the Medicaid program—i.e., the amount that Planned Parenthood health centers had \ncollectively received.  After the Senate Parliamentarian ruled that the provision improperly \ntargeted a single entity and could not be passed through the reconciliation process, the Senate \ntried to pass a version with a $1 million condition, thus sweeping in an additional entity and \npermitting Congress to go after its true target: the Planned Parenthood health centers.  With the \nDefund Provision, the Senate lowered the amount of received Medicaid funding to $800,000 to \nfurther ensure that the Senate Parliamentarian proved no obstacle.  Throughout the process, \nhowever, Congress has been clear that it was unconstitutionally targeting PPFA and the Planned \nParenthood health centers. \n124.  Because of the federal-state nature of Medicaid, this provision ultimately requires \nthe Plaintiff States to carry out this unconstitutional agenda.  To ensure federal dollars are not \nspent through a “State Plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act or a waiver of such plan,” \nwhether through “a contract or other arrangement between a State and covered organization,” the \nPlaintiff States will be required either to exclude the Planned Parenthood health centers from \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 39 of 83\nparticipation in a State Plan and/or terminate or alter existing contracts and agreements with \nPlanned Parenthood health centers, or lose federal reimbursements by funding Planned \nParenthood health centers exclusively out of state funds.   \n125.  This provision presents the Plaintiff States with an untenable choice: exclude the \nPlanned Parenthood health centers from any state Medicaid program and lose critical healthcare \ninfrastructure, or, for those States that can, to choose to fully or partially fund services obtained \nat Planned Parenthood health centers using only state dollars—foregoing hundreds millions of \ndollars in reimbursement that otherwise would, and should, be provided by the federal \ngovernment under the Medicaid Act.     \n126.  The Defund Provision thus conditions the Plaintiff States’ receipt of federal \nMedicaid funds for the services that the Planned Parenthood health centers provide on the \nPlaintiff States’ willingness to force their Medicaid program enrollees to forego services from \nPlanned Parenthood health centers and attempt to obtain covered services from alternative \nhealthcare providers, which may or may not be available in their area.  As such, to obtain those \nfederal Medicaid funds, the Defund Provision requires the Plaintiff States to effectuate \nCongress’s and the President’s unconstitutional retaliation against the Planned Parenthood health \ncenters, resulting in harm to the Plaintiff States through either the diversion of millions of state \ndollars from other state programs or through long-term increases in state Medicaid expenses \nfrom the delays in care that will result from the closure of Planned Parenthood health centers. \n127.  Because the Defund Provision targets Planned Parenthood health centers, the \nPlaintiff States have some sense of the scope of the providers who qualify as Prohibited Entities.  \nBut, on its face, the legislation tasks Plaintiff States with excluding Prohibited Entities without \nproviding guidance as to how Plaintiff States are to determine which multi-state entities meet the \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 40 of 83\ndefinition on October 1, 2025.  Plaintiff States do not have records of Medicaid payments made \nto multi-state healthcare entities by other states’ Medicaid programs or whether those entities \nprovide abortions within their scope of care.  Absent such information, Plaintiff States may not \nbe able to ascertain whether a multi-state healthcare entity that fails to meet the definition of \n“prohibited entity” because it received less than $800,000 from the State’s Medicaid program \nand/or does not provide abortion care nonetheless must be excluded because it is an “affiliate” of \nan entity that received greater than $800,000 in total from all States in which it operates and/or \nprovides abortion care.        \nIV.  THE DEFUND PROVISION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE PLAINTIFF STATES \n128.  The Defund Provision unquestionably causes injury to the Plaintiff States because \nit prevents the Plaintiff States from making payments to Planned Parenthood health centers \nthrough their State Medicaid programs using federal Medicaid dollars.  Each of the Plaintiff \nStates was permitted to make such payments to Planned Parenthood health centers, and did make \nsuch payments, before the Defund Provision was enacted.  By targeting Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers (and incidentally purportedly sweeping in a couple of other abortion providers to \nsurvive the Senate reconciliation procedure), the Defund Provision has already impacted many \nPlaintiff States by imposing administrative burdens to facilitate Congress’s unconstitutional \ntargeting of the Planned Parenthood health centers.  The Defund Provision will also impose \nadditional public healthcare costs on the Plaintiff States.  By targeting Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers, which are the largest providers of contraception; screening for cancers, such as \nbreast and cervical cancer; screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections; as well as \npregnancy care, the Defund Provision effectively strips that care from Medicaid enrollees, many \nof whom will likely go without care—including cost-saving preventative care—until they have \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 41 of 83\nno choice.  The result will be, among other things, delayed diagnoses of cancer and STIs and \nincreased unintended pregnancies, which will result not only in widespread and devastating \neffects on the health of vulnerable residents of the Plaintiff States, but also in increased costs to \nthe Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs, which fund care for those individuals. \nA.  The Defund Provision Puts States’ Medicaid Funding at Risk \n129.  States are the entities tasked with enforcing the Defund Provision by screening \nMedicaid reimbursement claims submitted by Prohibited Entities and directing Medicaid \nprogram enrollees to healthcare providers other than providers who qualify as “prohibited \nentities,” as defined in the provision.   \n130.  The Defund Provision, however, does not provide adequate guidance, definition, \nor notice to Plaintiff States as to which entities satisfy the conditions of the Defund Provision \nsuch that an entity may be permitted to continue to receive restricted Medicaid funding.  The \nDefund Provision is also ambiguous about the timing for enforcement of its prohibitions on \nfederal Medicaid funding for “prohibited entities.”  The Defund Provision requires that \nProhibited Entities stop receiving federal Medicaid funding as of the date of enactment, which is \nJuly 4, 2025.  But the definition of Prohibited Entity turns on whether an entity satisfies all four \ncriteria as of “the first day of the first quarter beginning after the date of enactment of th[e] Act,” \nwhich is October 1, 2025.   \n131.  The Defund Provision nevertheless tasks Plaintiff States with excluding \nProhibited Entities from their Medicaid programs.  But it is silent as to whether Plaintiff States \nare to make the initial determination of who to exclude, or whether that decision must be made \nby CMS.  Plaintiff States do not have access to claims data for other states, which is necessary to \ndetermine whether healthcare entities received more than $800,00 in Medicaid payments in \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 42 of 83\nfiscal year 2023, or to information concerning the types of services provided by a healthcare \norganization in other states to determine whether the organization is “primarily engaged in \nfamily planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”  And if the Plaintiff \nStates are not correct in their determinations, they risk either losing out on federal funding for \ncritical services for their residents, or they risk cutting off funding for entities that should receive \nfederal funding and thereby endangering healthcare access for their residents. \nB.  The Defund Provision Administratively Burdens Plaintiff States \n132.  The Defund Provision imposes administrative burdens on many Plaintiff States, \nwhich must educate their Medicaid providers about the Defund Provision and adjust their claims \nprocessing infrastructure to segregate out any claims from Planned Parenthood health centers \nand the few additional impacted providers so that those claims are not submitted for federal \nreimbursement.  Those impacts have already imposed harm on many Plaintiff States and will \ncontinue to do so while the Defund Provision remains in force.  For instance: \n133.  In California, DHCS, which is tasked with ensuring Medi-Cal complies with the \nrequirements of the Defund Provision, has had to restructure its policies and systems to segregate \nany claims submitted by an entity affected by the Defund Provision to ensure that DHCS does \nnot fund those claims using federally provided dollars.  That restructuring has required staff time \nand resources, which constitute harm.  Nor is the restructuring a self-inflicted harm:  if they \nfailed to incorporate the necessary infrastructure changes, DHCS and the Medi-Cal program \nwould have to return any federal funds used to pay claims submitted by entities defined under \nthe Defund Provision, thereby placing the costs directly onto California and reducing federally \nprovided matching Medicaid funds.     \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 43 of 83\n134.  DHCS has also had to issue guidance to California-based Medicaid providers, and \ndrafting, reviewing, and issuing these sets of guidance-imposed harms on California through the \nexpense of staff time and resources.  Due to the ambiguity regarding the entities that qualify as \nProhibited Entities and the timing of when the Defund Provision actually takes effect, DHCS \nwill likely face inquiries from potentially affected entities, which will also take staff time and \nresources.  In short, California has already suffered and will continue to suffer economic harm \nthrough the expense of staff time and resources to enforce the Defund Provision.  \n135.  In another example, the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and \nFinancing, which administers Colorado’s Medicaid program, will need to expend significant \nstaff and contractor time to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Defund Provision.  \nColorado’s compliance with the Defund Provision will require, at a minimum: (1) developing \nand deploying a system to ensure the state does not make any fee-for-service physical health \npayments to Planned Parenthood; (2) communicating to 5,000 Medicaid members who use \nPlanned Parenthood as a primary care medical provider that Planned Parenthood is no longer \ncontracted with Colorado’s manage care entities as a primary care medical provider; (3) \ndisaffiliating Planned Parenthood from managed care networks; (4) determining which Colorado \ngrants Planned Parenthood may receive as an integrated behavioral health provider; (5) \nevaluating alternative payment methodologies to determine whether any bundled payments or \nother alternative payments can reimburse Planned Parenthood for medically necessary services; \n(6) evaluating the modification of pharmacy payment systems to exclude Planned Parenthood; \n(7) identifying alternative sources of care and assisting with referrals for Health First Colorado \nand/or CHP+ members previously seen at Planned Parenthood for healthcare visits; and (7) \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 44 of 83\nevaluating potential conflicts with Colorado statues and regulations to ensure alignment with the \nDefund Provision. \n136.  Given the significant work required to comply with the Defund Provision, \nColorado is still determining how to provide payment guidance to our managed care entities, \nproviders and, most importantly, Health First Colorado and/or CHP+ members. \n137.  For Connecticut, regardless of whether it is able to allocate state funds to cover \nthe lost federal reimbursements for Planned Parenthood health centers or is forced to require \nparticipants in all state administered medical assistance programs to forego care at Planned \nParenthood health centers, Connecticut will incur administrative costs to implement the \nDefunding Provision. In either scenario, DSS will need to make alterations to its Medicaid \nprogram, potentially excluding Planned Parenthood health centers from its Medicaid program \nthrough a State Plan amendment, altering their current new provider agreement, or both.   \n138.  If Connecticut is able to allocate state funds to cover the lost federal \nreimbursement for Planned Parenthood health centers, DSS will need to make systematic and \nprogrammatic changes to segregate claims from the health centers to ensure that no claims are \nsubmitted to the federal government for reimbursement.  DSS will need to expend time and \nfunds to modify computer systems, update reporting, provide guidance to providers, and train \nstaff.  If DSS does not take these steps, and claims from Planned Parenthood health centers are \nsubmitted to CMS for reimbursement, then the State could be required to return those funds to \nthe CMS. \n139.  If Connecticut is unable to allocate state funds to cover the lost federal match and \nis forced to exclude Planned Parenthood health centers from its medical assistance programs, \nthen DSS will need to take steps to ensure that any claims from Planned Parenthood health \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 45 of 83\ncenters under federally funded Medicaid programs are rejected.  DSS will also need to expend \ntime and resources on guidance to inform Medicaid participants that they can no longer receive \ncare at Planned Parenthood health centers under HUSKY and to help participants identify and \naccess alternate providers for care. \n140.   Hawaiʻi’s Med-QUEST Division, in turn, has already been administratively \nburdened by the Defund Provision.  Med-QUEST has had to ensure that all managed care \norganizations hold any claims from Planned Parenthood health centers until Med-QUEST has \ndetermined how to comply with the Defund Provision.  Besides the managed care plans, Med-\nQUEST has had to work with their own fiscal agent to identify all Planned Parenthood health \ncenters and hold all their claims until determining how to comply.  The fiscal agent must now re-\nprocess claims manually.   \n141.  It is also not clear how the Defund Provision will affect other essential \ncommunity health care providers, in addition to Planned Parenthood.  This uncertainty has led to \ndifficulty for the Med-QUEST Division in determining how to comply with the Defund \nProvision. \n142.  In response to threats made to reproductive rights coming from Defendants and \nother federal officials, Massachusetts has been forced to identify state funds to support \nuninterrupted access to sexual and reproductive health care and other essential services at \nPlanned Parenthood in Massachusetts.  Specifically, in July 2025, Governor Maura Healey \nannounced that $2,000,000 appropriated by the Legislature for this purpose would be made \navailable to the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts to help defray the cost of critical \nnon-abortion services—such as cancer screenings, breast exams, contraception and STI testing \nand treatment critical—that the federal government will no longer cover.   \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 46 of 83\n143.  Additionally, Planned Parenthood is not the only organization in Massachusetts \nthat delivers abortion services and non-abortion services; a comprehensive, multi-service \norganization called Health Imperatives does as well.  And though MassHealth initially \ndetermined that Health Imperatives does not meet the definition of “prohibited entity” within the \nDefund Provision, HHS has assumed the opposite position in separate litigation involving \nPlanned Parenthood.  Yet Defendants have not published guidance to assist states in making that \ndetermination or said whether it is the state’s determination to make.  This added uncertainty \nharms Massachusetts because 1) absent clear guidance on how to implement the law, \nMassHealth may be at risk of applying the law differently than HHS and 2) even if the \ndetermination is Massachusetts’s to make, the state will have to take on the new administrative \nburden of developing an approach for gathering relevant data and information about providers to \nsupport such determination \n144.  For Minnesota, whether or not the state is able to allocate state funds to cover the \nlost federal reimbursements for Planned Parenthood health centers, Minnesota will suffer \nadministrative burdens if the Defund Provision is allowed to continue.  The definition of \nProhibited Entities will be difficult to apply because it is vaguely defined, and Minnesota will be \nrequired to invest staff time and resources in order to create a process to filter out such providers. \nFor example, the Defund Provision includes that the Prohibited Entity be an essential community \nprovider that “primarily engages in family planning services, reproductive health, and related \nmedical care.”  MDHS has never had to determine what type of services its participating \nproviders “primarily engage in,” nor does the statute set out criteria for making that \ndetermination.  If MDHS fails to comply with the Defund Provision, though, MDHS could face \nsignificant penalties from CMS for noncompliance, such as a claw back of funds issued to a \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 47 of 83\nProhibited Entity or stalled federal funding.  In sum, MDHS will have to expend time and \nresources to implement the Defund Provision or risk significant penalties from CMS. \n145.  New Jersey’s Department of Human Services (“NJDHS”), which administers \nNew Jersey’s Medicaid program, must ensure that NJ FamilyCare complies with the Defund \nProvision.  This will impose a significant administrative burden on the state. \n146.  The definition of Prohibited Entities is unworkable and vague.  New Jersey does \nnot have a system in place that can identify and exclude only certain providers from Medicaid \nparticipation based on the criteria specified in the Defund Policy.  NJDHS will need to exclude \nPlanned Parenthood health centers from its Medicaid program by building and applying \nindividual provider-based blocks to billing in its FFS and managed care systems.  This will \nimpose an additional administrative burden on the state and NJDHS. \n147.  New Jersey has not budgeted for these contingencies.  Nevertheless, if NJDHS \ndoes not promptly take steps to comply with the Defund Provision, the state could be subject to \nfederal audits, claw back demands, or set offs of future payments \n148.  New York will similarly suffer administrative burdens if the Defund Provision \nremains in effect because the definition of Prohibited Entities is unworkable, and no \ninfrastructure currently exists to filter out such providers.  New York’s DOH, which administers \nthe State Medicaid program, currently has no system in place to identify and exclude only \ncertain providers from Medicaid participation based on the criteria specified in the Defund \nPolicy.  Implementing the Defund Policy would cost money and time as DOH would be required \nto build a new enforcement system from scratch to identify and remove providers that violate the \npolicy.  The Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), the system that manages \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 48 of 83\nclaims, payments, and other related data for the state’s Medicaid program, is approximately 30 \nyears old and is extremely inflexible. Minor changes to this system often take over 12 months. \n149.  DOH will struggle to identify providers who qualify as Prohibited Entities \nbecause the term Prohibited Entity is vaguely defined.  Specifically, the statute includes among \nits criteria that the Prohibited Entity be an essential community provider that “primarily engages \nin family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”  As with Minnesota’s \nMDHS, New York’s DOH likewise has never had to determine what type of services its \nparticipating providers “primarily engage in,” nor does the statute set out criteria for making that \ndetermination.  \n150.  For example, the Defund Provision does not specify whether “primarily engage \nin” is assessed by self-designation of the entity in question, which DOH does not currently ask \nfor, or whether the State is to make that determination itself.  And if it is the latter, the Defund \nProvision does not describe how the State should go about doing so; the Defund Provision does \nnot specify what universe the “primarily engage in” criterion is measured against—whether it is \nlimited to the universe of Medicaid billing or whether it includes services billed to private \ninsurance or private pay, which data the New York does not collect.  And assuming it can even \nbe determined under the Defund Provision’s vague terms which entities are considered \nprohibited, New York will also have to provide guidance to participating providers about \nwhether they are or are not considered prohibited.  \n151.  DOH must comply in order to ensure that federal dollars are spent consistently \nwith federal law, with significant penalties for noncompliance.  CMS is authorized to defer, \ndisallow, or claw back funds that were issued to a Prohibited Entity.  A failure to spend federal \nMedicaid dollars in accordance with federal strictures is grounds for negative audits and \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 49 of 83\npenalties from federal authorities.  Worse yet, CMS could invalidate the program, pull back \nawards, or stall funding if compliance could not be validated. \n152.  Because participating providers have 90 days to submit bills to Medicaid, DOH \nwill have to provide guidance to existing participating providers who may fall under the category \nof Prohibited Entities as to how the restrictions impact billing for services already provided and \ncurrently being provided, and communicate with Prohibited Entity providers to direct them not \nto bill for any services because the provision has ostensibly gone into effect.  N.Y. Comp. Codes \nR. & Regs. tit. 18, § 540.6.  \n153.  In sum, New York State DOH will have to expend time and resources creating a \nnew system to determine which entities are considered prohibited, collect data it does not \ncurrently collect, and create resources, materials, and communications that do not currently exist, \nin order to comply with the Defund Provision, at risk of significant penalties from CMS. \n154.  North Carolina’s NCDHHS, which administers North Carolina’s Medicaid \nprogram, in turn will need to retool its Medicaid claims processes in order to ensure that \nProhibited Entities do not submit claims or receive reimbursements. NCDHHS will need to \nexpend considerable time and resources implementing these changes, retraining staff, and \nredirecting NC Medicaid participants to alternative providers where available. \n155.  In Oregon, OHA, which is tasked with ensuring the state Medicaid programs \ncomply with federal law, has been forced to devote significant staff time and resources to \nadjusting its Medicaid payment review and processing systems to account for the Defund \nProvision.  OHA’s Reproductive Health Program, which administers CCare, and OHA’s \nMedicaid program, which administers OHP, have had to coordinate across programs to develop \nunique guidance for Coordinated Care Organizations and Planned Parenthood health centers to \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 50 of 83\ninstruct them about how to process claims in compliance with OHP and CCare as well as the \nDefund Provision.  Further, OHA has been required to develop entirely new processes for all \nclaims from all Planned Parenthood health centers to be held and then reviewed manually to \ndetermine whether the services provided are eligible for federal Medicaid funds.  Before the \nDefund Provision, both OHP and CCare claims were processed in a streamlined, efficient, and \nautomated way.  The efforts to comply with the Defund Provision have cost OHA extensive staff \ntime and resources.  Oregon has suffered and will continue to suffer harm by spending staff time \nand resources to implement the Defund Provision. \n156.  Like many states, Vermont is facing federal funding cuts impacting a broad range \nof essential state programs and services.  State budgets are not infinite, and Vermont will \nultimately be required to make extremely difficult decisions about which impacted programs and \nservices it will be able to step in and support using those resources.  Regardless of whether \nVermont is able to allocate state funds to cover the lost federal reimbursements for Planned \nParenthood health centers or is forced to require participants in all state-administered medical \nassistance programs to forego care at those health centers, Vermont will incur administrative \ncosts to implement the Defunding Provision. \n157.  In Washington, in federal fiscal year 2023, Planned Parenthood health centers \nreceived approximately $23.8 million in Apple Health funding, which includes approximately \n$11.8 million in federal funding.  Planned Parenthood is an important Apple Health provider, \noffering services such as preventative care and cancer screenings.  Given Planned Parenthood’s \nimportant role in the Apple Health program, Washington Governor Bob Ferguson, on July 9, \n2025, agreed to make state funding available to cover any lost federal funds if litigation \nchallenging the Defund Provision is unsuccessful.  This will ensure that Washingtonians \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 51 of 83\ncontinue to have access to medically necessary care.  However, this funding will come at the \nexpense of other essential state services. \n158.  Washington’s HCA, which is tasked with ensuring that the State complies with \nthe Defund Provision, still has needed to expend significant time and resources to comply with \nthe Defund Provision and ensure that HCA does not use any federal funds to pay for any claims \nsubmitted by entities affected by it.  For example, HCA has restructured its policies and systems \nto segregate any affected claims. \n159.  In addition, HCA and its contracted actuarial consultants will need to expend \nsignificant time and resources to update HCA’s payment rates to managed care organizations \n(MCOs) for calendar year 2025.  HCA has contracts with five MCOs who ensure the provision \nof services to Apple Health clients; HCA will need to amend those contracts.  In particular, HCA \nwill need to remove the cost experience for claims from affected entities from the payment \nrates.  HCA also will need to amend the rate certification, which is required by federal rules. \n160.  In Wisconsin, the Defund Provision will administratively burden the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health Services.  The Department will have to reconfigure its system to ensure \nthat federal funds are not paid to those providers in Wisconsin who would satisfy the criteria for \na “prohibited entity.”  Currently, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services does not \nmaintain information on whether an essential community provider, as described in 45 C.F.R § \n156.235, is primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related \nmedical care, or whether an entity provides for abortions other than those enumerated in the \nDefund Provision.  The Wisconsin Department of Health Services will need to invest system and \nstaff resources into verifying and maintaining this information, and it will need to expend time \nand resources to modify impacted systems to accommodate these changes. \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 52 of 83\nC.  The Defund Provision Imposes Economic Harm and Burdens Public \nHealth   \n161.  In addition to administrative burdens, the Defund Provision will force Plaintiff \nStates either to use states funds to keep Planned Parenthood health centers operating and forgo \nmatching federal funds, or exclude the Planned Parenthood health centers from any state \nMedicaid program and lose critical healthcare infrastructure.  Plaintiff States are also facing an \nunprecedented number of federal funding cuts impacting a broad range of essential state \nprograms and services.  State budgets are not infinite, and many Plaintiff States will ultimately \nbe required to make extremely difficult decisions on which programs and services they will be \nable to step in and support using those finite resources. \n162.  For Plaintiff States that cannot fully fund Medicaid services at Planned \nParenthood health centers with their state funds, the Defund Provision will result in those health \ncenters predictably having to close or significantly limit their services.  Those restrictions in turn \nwill have widespread negative impacts on the public health of vulnerable residents of the \nPlaintiff States, resulting in increased public health expenses to the Plaintiff States that cannot \nafford to fully fund the Medicaid services at the clinics.  And it will frustrate the interests of the \nPlaintiff States who have, within their sovereign authority to regulate public health and welfare, \nchosen to promote widespread access to the full range of reproductive health care services, \nincluding cancer screening, STI screening and treatment, and access to family planning services. \n1.  Planned Parenthood Health Centers Provide Highly Specialized \nHealthcare and Have Particular Expertise that Cannot Be \nReplicated with Existing Healthcare Centers \n163.  PPFA estimates that the Defund Provision risks the closure of nearly 200 Planned \nParenthood health centers throughout 24 states,30 with the few additional health centers \n \n30 BREAKING: New CBO Report Shows “Defunding” Planned Parenthood Would Cost \n(continued…) \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 53 of 83\nincidentally swept into the provision also potentially shutting down.  PPFA further estimates that \n“more than 1.1 million patients could lose access to care.”31     \n164.  In California, losing access to Medicaid reimbursements will mean California \nPlanned Parenthood health centers will lose nearly two-thirds of their funding.32  California’s \nPlanned Parenthood health centers are critical to the Medi-Cal program’s sexual and \nreproductive health care provider network:  they annually provide approximately $425 million of \nservices to patients covered by Medi-Cal and its related programs, with $328 million (i.e., 77 \npercent) paid by federal funds.33  In 2024, Planned Parenthood health centers provided care to \n800,000 Medi-Cal members, resulting in 2.2 million submitted claims for the healthcare services \nthey provided.  California’s Planned Parenthood health centers serve residents throughout the \nstate, in rural, suburban, and urban areas, often as one of the few—if not only—location to \nprovide healthcare in their areas.  One California Planned Parenthood member estimates that 80 \npercent of its current patients will no longer be able to access healthcare.34  Already, Planned \nParenthood Mar Monte, a California member, has announced the closure of five of its clinics.35 \n165.  In Connecticut, which provides coverage for comprehensive family planning \nservices through HUSKY, Planned Parenthood health centers play an essential role in providing \nthose services.  Planned Parenthood health centers provided 72 percent of all contraceptive \n \nTaxpayers $52 Million Over 10 Years, Planned Parenthood Action Fund (June 29, 2025), \nhttps://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/pressroom/breaking-new-cbo-report-shows-\ndefunding-planned-parenthood-would-cost-taxpayers-52-million-over-10-years.  \n31 Id.  \n32 Decl. of Jenna Tosh in Supp. of Pls.’ Emergency Mot. for Temp.

Overall, Planned Parenthood health centers \nprovide care to over 26,000 patients through Husky each year in Connecticut.   \n166.  For Fiscal Year 2024, the state paid Planned Parenthood health centers $11.9 \nmillion for services provided to HUSKY participants.  Of that total, $3.6 million was for fully \nstate-funded services and $29,000 was for fully state-funded program participants.  For the \nremaining $8.3 million, the state paid $2.2 million, and the federal government paid $6.1 million.  \nThe  average  federal  reimbursement  rate  for  CHIP  participants  receiving  care  at  Planned \nParenthood health centers in Connecticut was 65 percent and for all other participants in federally \nfunded Medicaid programs was 74 percent. \n167.  Maine's family planning care network consists of 18 Maine Family Planning \n(MFP) health centers, 4 Planned Parenthood Northern New England (PPNNE) health centers, 32 \nFederally Qualified Health Centers, and 8 School-based health centers.  MFP is a Maine non-\nprofit that offers a range of family planning, reproductive health, and primary care services.   \n168.  MFP directly operates 18 health care centers in Augusta, Bangor, Belfast, Calais, \nDamariscotta, Dexter, Ellsworth, Farmington, Fort Kent, Houlton, Lewiston, Machias, Norway, \nPresque Isle, Thomaston, Rumford, Skowhegan, and Waterville.  MFP also has a mobile health \nclinic.  MFP provides funding through subcontracts that support 44 additional sites.  Two MFP \nclinics are listed as an “essential community provider” in the family planning category on the \nHHS Rolling Draft Essential Community Provider (ECP) List for the Federally-facilitated \nMarketplace (the “ECP List”).  By definition, essential community providers serve \n“predominantly low-income, medically underserved individuals.” 45 C.F.R. § 156.235(c).  In \ncalendar year 2024, MFP clinics served over 8,000 patients, including 7,215 family planning \npatients.  Family planning patients had over 10,000 visits and primary care patients had over \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 55 of 83\n2,000 visits.  In calendar year 2024, 49.8% of patients who received services other than abortion \ncare at MFP were enrolled in MaineCare.  Without MaineCare, many of these patients could not \nafford to see a health care provider and might postpone or forgo care altogether.   \n169.  MFP provides a range of critical family planning and reproductive health care \nservices, including contraceptive services; pregnancy testing and options counseling; family \nplanning (or preconception) counseling; referrals for adoption; prenatal consultation; \ngynecological biopsies; annual wellness visits; gynecological exams; breast exams; pap tests; \ncolposcopies; screening for cervical and breast cancer; screening, diagnosis, and treatment of \nSTIs, vaginal infections, and urinary tract infections; intrauterine insemination; vasectomy; \nconsultations and prescriptions for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis; miscarriage care; gender-\naffirming health care; and family support services for pregnant women, new mothers, and their \nfamilies. \n170.  In the 2024 fiscal year, 27 percent of the 7,100 patients who received care at \nPPNNE health centers in Maine were on MaineCare.  PPNNE’s health centers in Maine \nprovided care for these patients for more than 2,800 visits.  PPNNE’s health centers offer a broad \nrange of essential health care services to Maine patients, including well-patient checkups with \nsome primary care services; annual gynecological exams; screening for cervical, colorectal and \nbreast cancer; family planning counseling; erectile dysfunction treatment; birth control and \ncontraception services; preconception consultation; screening, diagnosis and treatment of urinary \ntract, vaginal, and sexually transmitted infections; biopsies for gynecological issues; vaccines for \ninfluenza, human papilloma virus, and monkeypox; perimenopause and menopause care; and \nmiscarriage and abortion care.   \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 56 of 83\n171.  Maine patients already face significant barriers to care, including financial and \nlogistical challenges of accessing providers, challenges that are particularly acute in the more \nrural areas of the state.  Maine also faces a shortage of heath care providers, including primary \ncare providers.  PPNNE does not currently receive state family planning funding.  Medicaid \nfunding is essential to both PPNNE Maine and MFP health centers and allows PPNNE and MFP \nto serve low-income patients in Maine. \n172.  Massachusetts’s MassHealth paid Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts \napproximately $4.8 million in Medicaid payments during federal fiscal year 2023.  Of those \npayments, $1.8 million were for non-abortion family planning and related services.  MassHealth \nclaimed 90 percent federal reimbursements on the non-abortion services.  While MassHealth \nclaims federal reimbursement for expenditures for family planning services and other non-\nabortion reproductive health care, it covers abortion care at all state cost whether provided fee-\nfor-service or by the Commonwealth’s contracted managed care entities. \n173.  Minnesota’s Medical Assistance program provides coverage for comprehensive \nsexual and reproductive health services.  A significant percentage of Medical Assistance \nrecipients need access to full-scope reproductive healthcare.  Planned Parenthood health centers \nplay an essential role in providing those services.  Overall, Planned Parenthood health centers \nprovide care to over 24,000 patients through Medical Assistance each year in Minnesota.  The \nestimated cost to the State of Minnesota of fully covering the services offered by Planned \nParenthood is approximately $9 million. \n174.  In New Jersey, there are two Planned Parenthood members: Planned Parenthood \nof Northern, Central, and Southern New Jersey and Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan New \nJersey.  These two members operate 20 centers across the state.  Both NJ FamilyCare enrollees \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 57 of 83\nand Plan First participants access services at Planned Parenthood locations in the state.  In FY \n2023, for example, approximately 28,990 NJ FamilyCare enrollees received care at New Jersey \nPlanned Parenthood clinics.  The two New Jersey Planned Parenthood members collectively \nbilled $6.9 million to NJ FamilyCare in FY 2023 for fee-for-service and managed care services.  \nNew Jersey paid approximately $1.4 million of those claims, and the federal government paid \n$5.4 million. \n175.  Nevada’s Medicaid program provides coverage for comprehensive family \nplanning services.  Planned Parenthood locations in Nevada provide early pregnancy \nmanagement including pregnancy testing, miscarriage management, diagnosis of ectopic \npregnancies, postpartum counseling, and contraception; STI testing and treatment; education; \nand other necessary family planning services to recipients of Nevada Medicaid.  The loss of 60 \npercent FMAP for these services will cause financial and health care related harms to Nevada \nand Nevada Medicaid recipients. \n176.  In New York, New York’s Medicaid program, which is overseen by New York \nDepartment of Health (DOH), provides comprehensive health coverage to more than 7.5 million \nNew Yorkers (as of December 2023).  Medicaid pays for a wide range of services, depending on \nthe enrollee’s age, financial circumstances, family situation, or living arrangements through a \nlarge network of health care providers. \n177.  The costs of services, including sexual and reproductive health services, provided \nthrough New York’s Medicaid programs are shared between the state and federal government, \nwith a Federal Medical Assistance Percentage that varies, but is 50% for most services and up to \n90% for defined Family Planning services.  Covered services include, sexual and reproductive \nhealth care services, including for family planning/contraception, sexually transmitted infection \n57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 58 of 83\nscreenings, diagnosis and treatment and primary and preventative health care. (Abortion is 0% \nfederally funded.) \n178.  Many New Yorkers have a personal need for sexual and reproductive health \nservices.  In 2022, there were 3,881,117 women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years old) in the \nstate.  Whether enrolled in Medicaid, or any non-Medicaid health plan, New Yorkers need \naccess to sexual and reproductive health services across our state. \n179.  In 2023, the most recent year for which complete data are available, \napproximately 88,500 individual Medicaid enrollees sought care at Planned Parenthood \nmembers across the state, with approximately 156,000 claims for services provided to Medicaid \nmembers processed.  \n180.  New York provides sexual and reproductive health service coverage to Medicaid \neligible individuals and an expanded population through its Family Planning Benefit Program \n(FPBP), a public health insurance program for New Yorkers who need family planning services \nonly.  FPBP is intended to increase access to confidential family planning services and to enable \nteens, women, and men of childbearing age to prevent and/or reduce the incidence of unintended \npregnancies.  Individuals may be eligible if they meet residential, citizenship, and income \nrequirements, and are not already enrolled in Medicaid.  However, an individual who already has \nhealth coverage through Medicaid may still apply for only the family planning services.  \n181.  The estimated additional cost to the State of New York of fully covering the \nservices offered by Planned Parenthood health centers, if matching federal funds cannot be \naccessed, is $21 million.  Those funds are not allocated in the current fiscal year budget, which \nwas finalized on May 9, 2025.  New York was not aware, nor could it have anticipated that \nCongress would take the unprecedented step of eliminating Medicaid funding to a specific \n58 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 59 of 83\ncategory of providers.  In order to cover the shortfall, New York would have to reallocate State \nfunding from other budget allocations not yet spent, or possibly convene a special session of the \nstate legislature to attempt to pass a budget amendment if sufficient funds from existing \nallocations cannot be identified. \n182.  In North Carolina, for State Fiscal Year 2024, Planned Parenthood health centers \nin North Carolina received over $862,000 in Medicaid reimbursements.  The majority of these \nreimbursements covered services such as annual exams, pap smears, birth control (including \nIUDs and vasectomies), labs, preventative screenings, colposcopies, and vaccinations. \n183.  Two Planned Parenthood members that operate health centers in Oregon are both \nenrolled providers under OHP and certified providers under CCare.  They are Planned \nParenthood of the Columbia Willamette (PPCW) and Planned Parenthood of Southwestern \nOregon (PPSO).  PPCW and PPSO are the only providers in Oregon subject to the Defund \nProvision.  Together, PPCW and PPSO operate 11 health centers in Oregon and one in \nVancouver, Washington, which is across the river from Portland.  In state fiscal year 2025, OHP \nreimbursed PPCW and PPSO for 56,989 family planning and reproductive health visits or \nencounters provided to 35,096 unique patients.  In that same time period, CCare reimbursed \nPPCW and PPSO for 8,466 family planning visits or encounters provided to 5,730 unique CCare \npatients.  Together, PPCW and PPSO health centers provide a substantial portion of all \nMedicaid-funded reproductive health care and family planning services in Oregon.  For example, \nPPCW and PPSO health centers served 65 percent of unique CCare patients in state fiscal year \n2025 \n184.  In Rhode Island, Planned Parenthood Rhode Island is one of fifteen health centers \noperated by Planned Parenthood Southern New England, Inc.  Planned Parenthood Rhode Island \n59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 60 of 83\nprovides essential health services, including sexual and reproductive health care services, family \nplanning, cancer screenings and testing, treatment and preventative care for sexually transmitted \ninfections to over 10,000 patients.  Approximately a quarter of those patients are Medicaid enrollees. \n185.  The cost of services provided through the Rhode Island Medicaid program are shared \nby the State of Rhode Island and federal government, with the federal government covering the \nmajority of these costs.  The elimination of this FMAP for services provided by Planned Parenthood \nwould representative a significant funding shortfall for the state. In order to ensure the continued \ndelivery of care for the Medicaid population in Rhode Island and compensate for this sudden loss of \nfunding for services that the state was expecting to be covered pursuant to its FMAP, Rhode Island’s \nGeneral Assembly would have to reconvene to determine a reallocation of state monies, away from \nother services and programs that were deemed necessary and essential to the well-being of Rhode \nIslanders. \n186.  Beyond the direct monetary harm that will befall Rhode Island as a result of this \ncancellation of promised Medicaid funds, Rhode Island’s health care delivery system would be \noverwhelmed by the sudden closure of a facility that currently provides basic, essential primary \ncare services to over 10,000 patients per year.  Rhode Island is experiencing a crisis in lack of \naccess to primary care.  Many Rhode Islanders lack primary care providers and are forced to \naccess care for acute needs through alternative sites, such as urgent care centers and emergency \ndepartments.  Other facilities, such as clinics and pharmacies, provide critically important \nscreenings, vaccinations and other routine, preventative and essential health care services that \nwould otherwise be unavailable to Rhode Islanders in light of the severity of the persevering \nprimary care shortage.  Rhode Island’s health care delivery system cannot absorb the 10,000 \n60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 61 of 83\npatients who would be displaced by a failure of Planned Parenthood Rhode Island to continue the \nservices they provide. \n187.  If the Defund Provision goes into effect, the impact for Wisconsinites will be \ndramatic.  Planned Parenthood plays a central and critical role in Wisconsin’s reproductive \nhealthcare system. Planned Parenthood serves over 47,000 patients in Wisconsin annually at \nover 20 health centers, and the overwhelming majority of the care it provides (roughly 90 \npercent) involves contraception and STI services.36  In 2021, one in five female Wisconsin \nMedicaid patients aged 15 to 49 received family planning services at Planned Parenthood.37 \n188.  Other Wisconsin providers would not likely be able to absorb Planned \nParenthood’s patient caseload. For example, the Guttmacher Institute estimates that without \nPlanned Parenthood clinics, other Wisconsin community health centers would have to increase \ntheir contraceptive patient caseload by 144 percent.38 \n189.  Moreover, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services anticipates that the \nDefund Provision would increase spending in other benefit areas, such as transportation services \nand medical costs, because Wisconsin Medicaid members may need to seek these necessary \ncovered services at providers outside of their geographic area or may forgo critical preventative \ncare, which can result in a need to seek more costly medical treatment or emergency services. \n190.

Nor are these circumstances unique.  For example, the current medical care \necosystem for Medicaid enrollees, which is already stretched thin,39 is unlikely to be able to \nabsorb the contraceptive care patients that Planned Parenthood health centers will no longer \nserve.  According to research by the Guttmacher Institute, “[n]ationwide, Planned Parenthood \nclinics served 1.6 million (33 percent) of the 4.7 million contraceptive clients served by safety-\nnet family planning centers in 2020.”40  Each Planned Parenthood health center serves an \naverage of approximately 2,600 female contraceptive clients per year.41    \n192.  Alternatives to Planned Parenthood, such as federally qualified health centers \n(FQHCs), public health departments, and hospital-based centers, lack that specialization, \nfocusing instead on primary care for their patients, as evidenced by their care statistics.  \nAccording to research by the Guttmacher Institute, FQHCs annually serve an average of \napproximately 330 female patients seeking contraception; public health department sites serve an \naverage of approximately 320 such patients; hospital-based centers serve an average of \napproximately 640 such patients; and centers operated by other types of agencies serve an \naverage of approximately 410 such patients.42   \n193.  The Guttmacher Institute determined that excluding Planned Parenthood health \ncenters from federal programs such as Medicaid, would require these other types of health \n \n39 The Commonwealth Fund, Community Health Centers’ Progress and Challenges in \nMeeting Patients’ Essential Primary Care Needs (Aug. 8, 2024), \nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/aug/community-health-\ncenters-meeting-primary-care-needs-2024-FQHC-survey.  \n40 Guttmacher FQHC Research, supra note 38. \n41 Id. \n42 Id. \n62 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 63 of 83\ncenters to “dramatically increase their contraceptive client caseloads to serve the patients \ncurrently obtaining contraceptive services at Planned Parenthood health centers.43  FQHCs \n“offering contraceptive care would have to increase their capacity to provide these services by \n56 percent, or an additional one million contraceptive clients”; “[h]ealth department sites \noffering contraceptive care would have to increase their capacity to provide these services by 28 \npercent, or an additional 168,000 contraceptive clients”; “[h]ospital sites offering contraceptive \ncare would have to increase their capacity to provide these services by 53 percent, or an \nadditional 344,000 contraceptive clients”; and “[o]ther sites offering contraceptive care, such as \nthose operated by independent agencies, would have to increase their capacity to provide these \nservices by 55 percent, or an additional 189,000 contraceptive clients.”44      \n194.    Experience with state-based exclusion of Planned Parenthood health centers \nfrom receiving public funds demonstrates the likely devastating impacts.  For example, research \nin Texas following that state’s exclusion of Planned Parenthood health centers from receiving \npublic funds for healthcare shows that alternative healthcare entities are unlikely to absorb their \npatient population.  Looking at the two years before and after Texas’ exclusion of Planned \nParenthood health centers from public funding, researchers found that significant decreases in \nthe number of Medicaid claims for long-acting, reversible contraceptives (35.5 percent decrease) \nand for injectable contraception (31.1 percent decrease).45  Medicaid-covered childbirths \nincreased by 1.9 percentage points.46 \n \n43 Id.

The reduction in access to these critical services will mean that many Medicaid \nenrollees are denied access to care altogether.  This will dramatically increase the costs to the \nPlaintiff States’ public fisc and frustrate their ability to effectuate their public policy of providing \nwidespread access to the full range of reproductive health care services. \n2.  Patients’ Lack of Access to Cancer Screening and Treatment as a \nResult of the Defund Provision Will Negatively Impact Plaintiff \nStates \n196.  Because Planned Parenthood health centers are a crucial structure in the medical \necosystem for low-income and vulnerable populations, the Defund Provision will have \nwidespread impacts on the public health in the Plaintiff States and will result in increases in the \nPlaintiff States’ costs to provide medical care for those residents. \n197.  First, the Defund Provision severely curtails access to cancer screening and \nprevention.  Planned Parenthood health centers and other abortion providers in the Plaintiff \nStates provide clinical breast exams and screening for both cervical and breast cancer.47  Their \nin-clinic services not only screen for reproductive cancers but can actually help prevent those \ncancers, such as through treatment of pre-cancerous cervical lesions to help prevent development \nof those lesions into cervical cancer.  The clinics also provide the HPV vaccine, which \neffectively reduces the likelihood of developing cervical cancer.  Indeed, in 2023, nationwide \nPlanned Parenthood clinics provided 426,268 cancer screening and prevention services, \nincluding 191,197 breast care services; 173,397 Pap tests; 40,247 HPV vaccinations; 11,513 \ncolposcopy procedures; 1,321 LEEP procedures; 1,626 cryotherapy procedures; and 6,967 other \ncancer diagnostic procedures.48  In 2024, California’s Planned Parenthood health centers \nprovided nearly 100,000 cancer screenings.   \n \n47 2023-2024 PPFA Annual Report, supra note 29, at 23. \n48 Id. \n64 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 65 of 83\n198.  Breast and cervical cancer screenings and prevention are particularly effective at \nreducing deaths, with breast cancer screenings resulting in 28 to 30 percent fewer deaths from \nbreast cancer and 80 to 87 percent fewer deaths from cervical cancer.49  Both types of screenings \nalso detect the cancers earlier, when they are easier and less expensive to treat.50   \n199.  Patients who would otherwise have received cancer screenings and preventative \nservices at Planned Parenthood health centers are unlikely to access such cancer screenings and \npreventative services at other health centers.  Research from Texas following its 2021 exclusion \nof Planned Parenthood health centers from its Medicaid program found that Medicaid enrollees \nwho previously had used Planned Parenthood health centers “faced difficulties accessing care \nelsewhere, including same-day appointments and on-site medications.”51  “Consequences \nincluded delayed or forgone reproductive health care, including contraception, and emotional \ndistress.”52  Similarly, after Iowa tried to replace publicly-funded Planned Parenthood health \ncenters with a state-funded family planning program, there was an “85 percent decline in \nindividual use” of the program.53  \n \n49 Simar Bajaj, Here’s What You Need To Know About Cancer Screening, N.Y.

As a result of patients forgoing these cancer screenings and preventative \ntreatments, many of those patients will not receive reproductive cancer diagnoses until such \ncancers have further progressed and are much harder—and more expensive—to treat.54  In light \nof the fact that the majority of Planned Parenthood health centers patients qualify for Medicaid, \nfor Plaintiff States that cannot fund these health centers without federal matching funds, those \nPlaintiff States are likely to face increased healthcare costs in their Medicaid programs as a result \nof those later-diagnosed reproductive cancers.  In other words, instead of the Plaintiff States \nmaking smaller payments through their Medicaid programs in the short-term for cancer \nscreenings and preventative treatments that result in early diagnoses and less expensive \ntreatment plans, the Defund Provision will cause the Plaintiff States to pay larger amounts in the \nlong-term for more expensive cancer treatments due to delayed diagnoses.   \n3.  Patients’ Lack of Access to STI Screenings and Treatments as a \nResult of the Defund Provision Will Negatively Impact Plaintiff \nStates \n201.  In addition to cancer screening and prevention, Planned Parenthood and other \nabortion providers also provide crucial access to STI screening, treatment, and prevention.  In \n2023, nationwide, Planned Parenthood clinics provided 5,132,330 STI tests and treatments, \nconsisting of 4,330,310 STI tests (such as for gonorrhea and chlamydia); 769,851 HIV tests; \n16,824 genital warts (HPV) treatments; and 15,345 other STI prevention and treatments.55  The \nvast majority of Planned Parenthood clinics also provide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and \npost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), medications that effectively reduce the chances of HIV-\nnegative individuals from acquiring HIV.  In 2024, California Planned Parenthood health centers \nprovided 2.6 million tests for STIs and provided PrEP and PEP to more than 6,000 patients.   \n \n54 CDC Cervical Cancer Intervention Benefits, supra note 50; CDC Breast Cancer \nIntervention Benefits, supra note 50. \n55 2023-2024 PPFA Annual Report, supra note 29, at 23. \n66 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 67 of 83\n202.  Patients who would otherwise have received STI screenings and treatments at \nPlanned Parenthood health centers are unlikely to access such STI screenings and treatments at \nother health centers.  Iowa, for example, not only saw a significant decrease in residents \naccessing family planning care after removing Planned Parenthood health centers from public \nfunding, but the state also saw spikes in the rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis.56   \n203.  As a result of patients forgoing STI screenings and treatments, a certain \npercentage of those patients are likely to not receive diagnoses of STI until the diseases have \nprogressed and are much harder—and more expensive—to treat.57  For example, untreated \nchlamydia and gonorrhea infections in women can result in pelvic inflammatory disease, which \nin turn can significantly impact fertility by causing scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes as well \nas causing ectopic pregnancies.58  Untreated syphilis infections can result in numerous negative \nhealth outcomes.  Because STIs are contagious, patients forgoing screenings and treatments due \nto the closure of Planned Parenthood health centers will most likely have the effect of increasing \nthe spread of STIs in Plaintiff States.   \n204.  This increased prevalence of STIs coupled with the fact that the majority of \nPlanned Parenthood health centers’ patients qualify for Medicaid will result in Plaintiff States \nwho cannot fully fund the health centers out of state funds having to pay increased healthcare \ncosts in their Medicaid programs.  In other words, instead of the Plaintiff States making smaller \npayments through their Medicaid programs in the short-term for STI screenings and early STI \ntreatments that result in less expensive treatment plans, the Defund Provision forces the Plaintiff \n \n56 Iowa’s Family Planning Service Use, supra note 53. \n57 Ctrs. for Disease Control, About Chlamydia (Jan. 31, 2025), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/chlamydia/about/index.html (hereinafter CDC About Chlamydia); Ctrs. for \nDisease Control, About Gonorrhea (Jan. 31, 2025), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/gonorrhea/about/index.html (hereinafter CDC About Gonorrhea) \n58 CDC About Chlamydia, supra note 57; CDC About Gonorrhea, supra note 57.   \n67 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 68 of 83\nStates to pay larger amounts in the long-term for more expensive STI treatments due to delayed \ndiagnoses and healthcare. \n4.  Patients’ Lack of Access to Contraceptive Care as a Result of the \nDefund Provision Will Have Negative Impacts on Plaintiff States \n205.  Planned Parenthood health centers are crucial providers of contraceptive care, \nparticularly to the vulnerable patient populations that constitute Medicaid enrollees.  As detailed \nabove, in 2020, for example, Planned Parenthood health centers nationally served 1.6 million (33 \npercent) of the 4.7 million contraceptive clients served by safety-net family planning centers in \n2020.59  \n206.  Defunding Planned Parenthood will cause many of these clients to lose access to \nhigh-quality contraceptive care with devastating consequences for individual patients and the \nPlaintiff States. \n207.  Contraceptives are among the most widely used medical products in the United \nStates, with 99 percent of sexually active women having used at least one type of contraception \nin their lifetimes.60  \n208.  The benefits afforded women who can control their reproductive choices are \nmonumental.  Due to the positive impact of contraception for women and society, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that family planning, including access to \nmodern contraception, was one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th \ncentury.61  \n \n59 Guttmacher FQHC Research, supra note 38. \n60 Contraceptive Use in the United States by Demographics, Guttmacher Inst.

In contrast, unintended pregnancy has negative health, fiscal, and societal impacts \nacross the United States.  In 2019, an estimated 41.6 percent of all pregnancies in the United \nStates were unintended.62  Unintended pregnancies are associated with increases in maternal and \nchild morbidity, including increased odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, and the potentially \nlife-long negative health effects of premature birth, all of which affect public health and in turn \nhave impacts on Plaintiff States’ public fiscs.63  Significantly, the risk of unintended pregnancy \nis greatest for the most vulnerable women:  young, low-income, minority women without a high \nschool or college education—a group that also makes up a significant percentage of the Plaintiff \nStates’ Medicaid enrollees.64   \n210.  The use of contraception has resulted in lower unintended pregnancy and abortion \nrates in the United States.  The Guttmacher Institute has found that the two-thirds of women who \nare at risk for unintended pregnancy and use contraception consistently account for only 5 \npercent of unintended pregnancies.65  Another study showed that, from the early 1990s to early \n \n62 Ctrs. for Disease Control, Unintended Pregnancy (May 15, 2024), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/hcp/unintended-\npregnancy/index.html#:~:text=Overview,2010 percent20to percent2035.7 percent20in \npercent202019. \n63 See Heidi D.

Increased access to contraceptives has resulted in the rate of abortions being at an \nall-time low.  A 2018 report from the CDC shows that the national abortion rate declined 26 \npercent between 2006 and 2015, hitting the lowest level that the government has on record.67  \nThe CDC credits access to healthcare services and specifically access to contraception as a \nsignificant factor influencing the decrease.68 \n212.  Further evidencing the benefits of contraception to the Plaintiff States and their \nresidents, with the decrease in unintended pregnancies, there is also a corresponding decrease in \nthe risk of maternal mortality, adverse child outcomes, behavior problems in children, and \nnegative psychological outcomes associated with unintended pregnancies for both mothers and \nchildren.69  \n213.  Significantly, access to contraceptive coverage helps women to delay \nchildbearing and pursue additional education, spend additional time in their careers, and have \nincreased earning power over the long-term.  Contraceptive use also allows for spacing between \npregnancies, which is important because there is an increased risk of adverse health outcomes for \npregnancies that are too closely spaced, and is especially critical for the health of women with \n \n66 John S.

There are additional benefits of contraceptive use for treating \nmedical conditions, including menstrual disorders and pelvic pain, and long-term use of oral \ncontraceptives has been shown to reduce women’s risk of endometrial cancer, pelvic \ninflammatory disease, and some breast diseases.70 \n214.  Contraceptive use unsurprisingly achieves significant cost savings to states, due \nin large part to the fact that contraceptives are much less costly than maternal deliveries.  In \n2002, the direct medical cost of unintended pregnancy in the United States was nearly $5 billion, \nwith contraception use saving an estimated $19.3 billion.71  Nationwide, in 2010, the \ngovernment expended an estimated $21 billion to cover the medical costs for unplanned births, \nmiscarriages and abortions.72  And in California, 48 percent of all pregnancies were unintended \nin 2010.  Of those unplanned pregnancies that resulted in births, 64.3 percent of those births \nwere publicly funded, costing California $689.3 million on unintended pregnancies. \n215.  The Defund Provision will significantly undermine the benefits of widespread \ncontraception use by targeting the biggest contraceptive coverage provider nationwide, Planned \nParenthood health centers.  By precluding Planned Parenthood health centers from receiving \nfederal funds from their care of Medicaid patients, the Defund Provision will necessarily result \nin millions being unable to access contraceptive care, resulting in increases in unintended \npregnancies and increased costs to the Plaintiff States that cannot fully fund the Prohibited \nEntities with their own state funds. \n \n70 Adolf E. Schindler, Non-Contraceptive Benefits of Oral Hormonal Contraceptives, 11 \nInt’l J. of Endocrinology & Metabolism 41, 41 (Dec. 2012), \nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3693657/  \n71 James Trussell, The Cost of Unintended Pregnancy in the United States, 75 \nContraception 168, 168 (Mar. 2007), https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17303484/ \n72 Sonfield et al, supra note 63.  \n71 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 72 of 83\n216.  These effects are not hypothetical:  Texas, which excluded Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers from receiving public funding more than a decade ago, saw significant decreases \nin claims for long-acting contraceptives, and increases in the number of Medicaid-covered \nchildbirths.73 \n217.  Further exacerbating the negative impacts on those Plaintiff States is the \nrestriction of access to abortion healthcare as a result of the Defund Provision, thereby \nexacerbating the negative outcomes from diminished access to contraceptive care and the \nresulting increase in unintended pregnancies.  The Defund Provision is likely to result in the \nclosure of one in four abortion providers nationwide and threatens to shut down half of abortion-\nproviding Planned Parenthood health centers.74  More than 90 percent of health center closures \nwould occur in states where abortion is protected and legal.75  \n218.  In sum, the Defund Provision will limit access to contraception for the Plaintiff \nStates’ vulnerable residents, resulting in both increased health risks for those residents and \nincreased unintended pregnancies.   \n219.  As a result, the Plaintiff States that cannot fully fund the Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers will face increased healthcare costs as the number of unintended pregnancies \nincrease.   \n \n73 Stevenson et al., supra note 45. \n74 Planned Parenthood Action Fund Statement on Senate Republicans’ Vote to “Defund” \nPlanned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood Action Fund (July 1, 2025), \nhttps://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/pressroom/planned-parenthood-action-fund-\nstatement-on-senate-republicans-vote-to-defund-planned-parenthood \n75 Id. \n72 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 73 of 83\nV.  THE DEFUND PROVISION IS AN IMPERMISSIBLY RETROACTIVE CONDITION ON \nMEDICAID \n220.  At the time that the Plaintiff States agreed to participate in Medicaid, and \nthroughout the past seven decades of its administration, Congress has never conditioned \nMedicaid funding on the exclusion of a particular provider from the program based on their \noffering abortions or other healthcare services outside of the Medicaid program.  Indeed, the \nonly provider exclusions permitted under Medicaid relate to commission of crimes and violation \nof federal law—neither of which are at issue here.  \n221.  Such an exclusion, targeting certain family planning providers for their \nconstitutional, legal activities outside of the Medicaid program, is not the type of condition that \nStates could, and should, have expected when they agreed to participate in the Medicaid \nprogram.  See Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 523 (2012). \n222.  This provision instead “surprises” states with a new condition on Medicaid funds \nbeyond what a state could have anticipated as part of their participation in the program.  Id. (“A \nState could hardly anticipate that Congress’s reservation of the right to “alter” or “amend” the \nMedicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically”). \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  \nSpending Clause: Lack of Clear Notice \nU.S. Const. art. I, section 8, cl. 1 \n223.  The Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation of the \nprior paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n224.  The Defund Provision conditions receipt of federal Medicaid funds for the non-\nabortion health care services that the Prohibited Entities provide on the Plaintiff States directing \n73 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 74 of 83\nof its Medicaid program enrollees to healthcare providers other than providers who qualify as \nProhibited Entities, as defined in the provision.  \n225.  The Defund Provision does not provide clear notice of the Plaintiff States’ \nobligations to satisfy the conditions to receive the restricted federal Medicaid funding.  See \nPennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981) (“The legitimacy of \nCongress’ power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the State \nvoluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’”) \n226.  The Defund Provision is ambiguous about the timing for enforcement of its \nprohibitions on federal Medicaid funding for Prohibited Entities.  The Defund Provision requires \nthat Prohibited Entities stop receiving federal Medicaid funding as of the date of enactment, \nwhich is July 4, 2025.  But the definition of Prohibited Entity turns on whether an entity satisfies \nall four criteria as of “the first day of the first quarter beginning after the date of enactment of \nth[e] Act,” which is October 1, 2025.  As such, the Defund Provision does not provide the \nPlaintiff States with clear notice of their obligations to satisfy the conditions necessary to access \nfederal Medicaid funds.  \n227.  The Defund Provision also is ambiguous because it fails to identify who is to \ndetermine which healthcare providers are Prohibited Entities.  The Defund Provision tasks \nPlaintiff States with excluding Prohibited Entities from their Medicaid programs.  But it is silent \nas to whether Plaintiff States or CMS will make the initial determination of which entities to \nexclude.  Plaintiff States also do not have access to claims data for other states, which may be \nnecessary to determine whether multi-state healthcare entities received more than $800,00 in \nMedicaid payments in fiscal year 2023 where those entities have not received such amount from \nthe Plaintiff State.  Nor do Plaintiff States have access to information concerning the types of \n74 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 75 of 83\nservices provided by a multi-state healthcare organization in other states to conclude either that \nan organization offers abortion care or “primarily engages in” the type of care outlined in the \nDefund Provision.  The Defund Provision, in fact, is silent as to how Plaintiff States will have to \ndetermine whether an organization “is primarily engaged in family planning services, \nreproductive health, and related medical care.”  As such, the Defund Provision does not provide \nthe Plaintiff States with clear notice of their obligations to satisfy the conditions necessary to \naccess federal Medicaid funds. \n228.  The Defund Provision further violates the “clear notice” requirement because it \nconstitutes a retroactive condition that Plaintiff States could not have anticipated at the time they \njoined Medicaid.  There has never been a similar restriction prohibiting the expenditure of \nfederal dollars through Medicaid to specific medical providers based solely upon the provision \nof a certain type of care outside of the Medicaid program.  As noted above, since Medicaid’s \nstart, States have retained significant discretion to determine which providers participate in their \nState Plans, with little federal oversight—a feature of the Medicaid system that has existed since \nenactment. \n229.  Accordingly, the Defund Provision fails to provide sufficiently clear notice of the \nPlaintiff States’ obligations as to render the provision an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’s \nSpending Clause power. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nSpending Clause: Unconstitutional Provisions \nU.S. Const. art. I, section 8, cl. 1 \n230.  The Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation of the \nprior paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   \n75 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 76 of 83\n231.  Because Medicaid is a state-federal partnership in which the states administer \nclaims from medical providers for Medicaid reimbursements, the states—not the federal \ngovernment—would ultimately be required to ensure that the Planned Parenthood health centers \nare effectively excluded from federal funding under the Defund Provision. \n232.  Because the Defund Provision unlawfully targets PPFA for their speech, \nDefendants are conscripting the States into effectuating this unconstitutional conduct. \n233.  The Defund Provision violates the First Amendment of the Constitution by \nretaliating against PPFA and the Planned Parenthood health centers for their First Amendment-\nprotected speech supporting and advocating for full reproductive rights, including rights to \nreceive abortion care.  The Defund Provision also violates the First Amendment of the \nConstitution by retaliating against Planned Parenthood health centers for exercising their First \nAmendment-protected right to associate with PPFA and each to engage in such advocacy.  The \nDefund Provision also treats Planned Parenthood health centers differently because of their \nexercise of First Amendment protected rights, thereby violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nEqual Protection Clause.  The Defund Provision also punishes PPFA and the Planned \nParenthood health centers by prohibiting the Planned Parenthood health centers from receiving \nfederal Medicaid funding, in violation of Article I’s prohibition on bills of attainder.  The \nDefund Provision does not reflect a health policy choice but was drafted to single out PPFA and \nPlanned Parenthood health centers for their abortion advocacy.  \n234.  The Defund Provision conditions the Plaintiff States’ receipt of federal Medicaid \nfunding on the Plaintiff States’ willingness to effectuate the Defund Provision’s unconstitutional \ntargeting of PPFA and the Planned Parenthood health centers.   \n76 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 77 of 83\n235.  Accordingly, the Defund Provision constitutes an “otherwise unconstitutional” \nexercise of Congress’s Spending Clause power.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF  \nWHEREFORE, the States respectfully request that this Court:  \n1.  Declare that the Defund Provision is unconstitutional;  \n2.  Enter a preliminary and permanent injunction against Defendants and any other \nagency or employee acting on behalf of Defendants prohibiting enforcement of the Defund \nProvision;   \n3.  Award the States’ costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and,  \n4.  Award such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.   \n \n \n \nDate:  July 29, 2025  Respectfully Submitted,  \nANDREA JOY CAMPBELL  ROB BONTA \nAttorney General  Attorney General \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts  State of California \n   \n/s/ Allyson Slater                                             /s/ Erica Connolly \nALLYSON SLATER (BBO No. 704545)  ERICA CONNOLLY* \nDirector, Reproductive Justice Unit  Deputy Attorney General  \nOffice of the Attorney General   NELI PALMA*  \nOne Ashburton Place, 20th Floor   Senior Assistant Attorney General  \nBoston, MA 02108   KARLI EISENBERG* \n(617) 963-2811  Supervising Deputy Attorney General  \nAllyson.slater@mass.gov  1300 I Street \nAttorneys for Plaintiff Commonwealth of  Sacramento, CA 95814 \nMassachusetts  (916) 210-7755 \n  Erica.Connolly@doj.ca.gov \n  Attorneys for Plaintiff State of California \n   \n \n77 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 78 of 83\n \n \n   \nLETITIA JAMES  WILLIAM TONG \nAttorney General  Attorney General \nState of New York  State of Connecticut \n    \n /s/ Galen Sherwin   /s/ Alma Nunley \nGALEN SHERWIN*  ALMA NUNLEY* \nSpecial Counsel for Reproductive Justice  Special Counsel for Reproductive Rights \nRABIA MUQADDAM*  JANELLE R.

At the end of the day on September 30, 2025, the appropriations act that had been \nfunding the Department of Justice expired and those appropriations to the Department lapsed.  The \nsame is true for the majority of other Executive agencies, including the federal Defendants.  The \nDepartment does not know when such funding will be restored by Congress. \n2.  Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the \nfederal Defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited \ncircumstances, including “emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of \nproperty.”  31 U.S.C. § 1342.   \n3.  Undersigned counsel for the Department of Justice therefore requests a stay of all \nproceedings in this case, including Defendants’ October 15, 2025, deadline to respond to Plaintiffs’ \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 67     Filed 10/01/25     Page 2 of 5\nMotion for a Preliminary Injunction, set by Court order at ECF No. 66, until Congress has restored \nappropriations to the Department.  \n4.  If this motion for a stay is granted, undersigned counsel will notify the Court as \nsoon as Congress has appropriated funds for the Department.  The Government requests that, at \nthat point, all current deadlines for the parties be extended commensurate with the duration of the \nlapse in appropriations – i.e., each deadline would be extended by the total number of days of the \nlapse in appropriations.  \n5.  The Government has conferred with opposing counsel, who opposed the motion. \n  Therefore, although we greatly regret any disruption caused to the Court and the other \nlitigants, the Government hereby moves for a stay of proceedings in this case until Department of \nJustice attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions. \nDated: October 1, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  BRETT A.

As this \nCourt has already recognized, the Defund Provision impermissibly and unconstitutionally targets \nPlanned Parenthood health centers for their advocacy and their exercise of associational rights.   \nBut the Defund Provision is unconstitutional for another reason:  in crafting a provision \nthat would both target Planned Parenthood health centers and satisfy the budget reconciliation \nprocess, Congress ran afoul of limits on its spending power.  The Defund Provision is wholly—\nand unconstitutionally—ambiguous.1  It fails to adequately define the scope of providers who \nqualify as “prohibited entities”; fails to provide clear notice of the timing of its implementation; \nand constitutes a change that Plaintiff States could not have anticipated when joining Medicaid.   \nPlaintiff States seek a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants Health and Human \nServices Secretary Robert F. Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services \n(collectively “HHS”), and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz and \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (collectively “CMS”) (with HHS, “Defendants”) from \nenforcing the Defund Provision against them.  If allowed to stay in effect, the Defund Provision \nwill result in irreparable harm to Plaintiff States.  As such, the balance of equities and the public \ninterest favor Plaintiff States as well.  This Court should grant Plaintiff States’ request. \n \n1 Plaintiff States are the States of California, New York, Connecticut, Colorado, \nDelaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New \nMexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, and the District of \nColumbia, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 7 of 31\n \nBACKGROUND \nI.  FACTUAL HISTORY \nA.  State Administration of Medicaid \n“The Medicaid program . . . is a cooperative endeavor in which the Federal Government \nprovides financial assistance to participating States to aid them in furnishing health care to needy \npersons.”  Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 308 (1980).  The Medicaid Act “gives the States \nsubstantial discretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and duration limitations on \ncoverage, as long as care and services are provided in ‘the best interests of the recipients.’”  \nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985).  Because States “have traditionally exercised \nprimary responsibility over ‘matters of health and safety,’ including the regulation of the practice \nof medicine,” the Supreme Court has emphasized that states enjoy broad discretion to determine \nwhich providers “qualify” for the Medicaid program.  Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic, \n145 S. Ct. 2219, 2227 (2025).  \nEach State designs and operates its own Medicaid program within boundaries set by \nfederal law, established in a State plan that is subject to review and approval by the federal \ngovernment.  See id. at 2226–27.  States administer claims for care from providers or managed \ncare plans, with CMS providing federal funds to States.  See Req. for Jud. Notice (“RJN”), Ex. 4, \nDoc. No. 61-4 at 4-5; Defs. Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Planned Parenthood Fed’n of \nAm., Inc. v. Kennedy, No. 1:25-cv-11913-IT (hereinafter “PPFA Litigation”), Doc. No. 53 at 41 \n(July 14, 2025) (hereinafter “PPFA Litigation Doc. No. 53”) (“Planned Parenthood receives \npayment from the states, not the Federal Government.”).  It is thus States—not CMS—that \ndetermine whether provider claims qualify for payment from state and federal Medicaid funds.  \nEach quarter, States provide CMS with estimates of their Medicaid expenses for that quarter, \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 8 of 31\n \nand, using those estimates, CMS provides federal matching funds.  Doc. No. 61-4 at 4-5.  \nCombining those federal funds with state funds, States pay claims to Medicaid providers, with \nthe federal portion constituting 50-90% of the payments.  Id.  Following the end of the quarter, \nStates report actual expenditures to CMS and engage in a review and reconciliation process \nthrough which States either return overpayments or CMS provides additional funds for \nunderpayments.  Id.   \nAlthough Congress has restricted federal Medicaid funds from paying for certain services, \nsuch as abortion care, Pub. L. 94-439, § 209 (initial version of Hyde Amendment), Congress has \nnever conditioned Medicaid funding on the exclusion of a particular provider based on their \noffering any healthcare services outside of the Medicaid program.  Indeed, the only provider \nexclusions permitted under Medicaid relate to commission of crimes and violation of federal \nlaw—neither of which are at issue here.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(a). \nB.  The Defund Provision \nThe federal budget bill, which was enacted on July 4, 2025, contains the Defund Provision.  \nThe Defund Provision provides that no federal Medicaid funds “shall be used to make payments \nto a prohibited entity for items and services furnished during the 1-year period beginning on the \ndate of the enactment of” the budget bill.  Pub. L. No. 119-21, § 71113, 139 Stat. 300 (2025) \n(hereinafter “Section 71113”).  It defines the term “prohibited entity” as providers that satisfy \nfour criteria as of October 1, 2025: 1) being a 501(c)(3) entity; 2) being an “essential community \nprovider” under 45 C.F.R. § 156.235 that “is primarily engaged in family planning services, \nreproductive health, and related medical care”; 3) “provid[ing] for abortions,” other than for \npregnancies resulting from rape or incest or where women are “in danger of death unless an \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 9 of 31\n \nabortion is performed”; and 4) receipt of more than $800,000 in state and/or federal Medicaid \nfunds in 2023.  Section 71113.   \nThe Defund Provision is the product of a years-long effort to block Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers from receiving federal Medicaid funds.  See, e.g., Declaration of Erica Connolly \n(“E. Connolly Decl.”) Exs. 1, 2, Doc. Nos. 62-1, 62-2; 163 Cong. Rec. H2373, H2409, 2433 \n(daily ed. Mar. 24, 2017) (statements of Reps. Matt Gaetz, Kevin Brady).  Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America (“PPFA”) and the Planned Parenthood health centers that constitute its \nmembers have advocated for abortion access for decades, see, e.g., RJN Ex. 1, Doc. No. 61-1 at \n5-6, 7, and as a result have long been a political target for those opposed to abortion access, see, \ne.g., Doc. No. 62-1, 62-2; E. Connolly Decl. Ex. 3, Doc. No. 62-3 at 24.  The Defund Provision \nis the fruition of that targeted opposition.  \nThe Defund Provision was included as part of the budget reconciliation process, which \nbypasses the filibuster and requires only a simple majority for passage of budget bills.  2 U.S.C. \n§ 641(e).  To clear the Defund provision through the narrow budget reconciliation rules, \nhowever, Congress crafted impermissibly ambiguous terms upon which Plaintiff States must \nnow rely to determine whether they can use federal Medicaid funds to reimburse providers for \nfamily planning and reproductive healthcare services.      \nC.  The Defund Provision’s Impact on Plaintiff States \n  The Defund Provision is already impacting Plaintiff States through increased \nadministrative burdens and compliance costs.  For example, Plaintiff States have had to \nrestructure their claims-processing infrastructure to try to accommodate the Defund Provision’s \nrequirements.  See, e.g., J. Connolly Decl. (MN), Doc. No. 62-15 at 7; Peterson Decl. (HI), Doc. \nNo. 62-10 at 5; Phelan Decl. (IL), Doc. No. 62-11 at 4; Probert Decl. (ME), Doc. No. 62-13 at 9; \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 10 of 31\n \nAdelman Decl. (NJ), Doc. No. 62-18 at 7; Smith Decl. (NM), Doc. No. 62-19 at 9; Morne Decl. \n(NY), Doc. No. 62-20 at 7-8; Standridge Decl. (WI), Doc. No. 62-24 at 5.  And the Defund \nProvision’s ambiguity has resulted in Plaintiff States having to field questions from providers \nand draft guidance to try to address the ambiguities.  See, e.g., Gilbert Decl. (CA), Doc. No. 62-6 \nat 8-9; Doc. No. 62-10 at 5; Doc. No. 62-13 at 9; Doc. No. 62-15 at 7; Doc. No. 62-18 at 7-8; \nDoc. No. 62-20 at 8; Sandoe Decl. (OR), Doc. No. 62-21 at 9-10. \n  In addition to these administrative changes, the Defund Provision will also result in \nsignificant increases in Plaintiff States’ healthcare expenses.  By targeting Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers as well as other known (and likely unknown) “prohibited entities,” the Defund \nProvision intentionally disrupts Plaintiff States’ healthcare ecosystems, which will lead to short-\nand long-term increases in Plaintiff States’ healthcare costs.   \nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn July 29, 2025, Plaintiff States filed their complaint against Defendants, alleging two \ncauses of action: 1) violation of the Spending Clause due to lack of clear notice; and 2) violation \nof the Spending Clause due to the inclusion of unconstitutional provisions.  Doc. No. 1.  Plaintiff \nStates have served Defendants with the Complaint.  Doc. Nos. 56, 56-1, 56-2.   \nThis case is related to the PPFA Litigation, in which PPFA, on behalf of its members and \nalongside two members as plaintiffs, alleged that the Defund Provision unconstitutionally \nviolated their rights.  Compl., PPFA Litigation, Doc. No. 1 (July 7, 2025).  This Court \npreliminarily enjoined the Defund Provision as to the plaintiffs.  Planned Parenthood Fed’n of \nAm., Inc. v. Kennedy, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2025 WL 2101940 (D. Mass. 2025).  On September 11, \n2025, the First Circuit issued an unpublished order granting Defendants’ motion to stay the \ninjunction pending resolution of the appeal of the injunction.  Order, Planned Parenthood Fed’n \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 11 of 31\n \nof Am., Inc. v. Kennedy, Nos. 25-1755, 25-1698 (1st Cir. Sept. 11, 2025).  The court stated, “we \nconclude that defendants have met their burden to show their entitlement to a stay of the \npreliminary injunctions pending the disposition of their appeals of the same” but did not further \nexplain the reasons for that conclusion.  Id. at *2. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“Before it grants a preliminary injunction, a district court is required to consider (1) the \nmovant’s likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the likelihood of the movant suffering \nirreparable harm; (3) the balance of equities; and (4) whether granting the injunction is in the \npublic interest.” Shurtleff v. City of Boston, 928 F.3d 166, 171 (1st Cir. 2019).  \nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFF STATES ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS \nThe Defund Provision is unconstitutional because it violates Congress’ spending powers.2  \nAlthough “Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the \nStates,” when it “attaches conditions to a State’s acceptance of federal funds, the conditions must \nbe set out ‘unambiguously.’”  Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, \n296 (2006).  “‘[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a \ncontract,’ and therefore, to be bound by ‘federally imposed conditions,’ recipients of federal \nfunds must accept them ‘voluntarily and knowingly.’”  Id.  “States cannot knowingly accept \nconditions of which they are ‘unaware’ or which they are ‘unable to ascertain.’”  Id.  This Court \nmust “view the [Defund Provision] from the perspective of a state official” and “ask whether \n \n2 Although the Defund Provision unconstitutionally targets Planned Parenthood health \ncenters (the subject of PPFA’s litigation and a claim in this case), Plaintiff States are uniquely \npositioned to raise the Spending Clause claim and move on this basis. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 12 of 31\n \nsuch a state official would clearly understand” the Defund Provision’s obligations, i.e., whether \nthe Defund Provision “furnishes clear notice.”  Id.   \nThe Defund Provision conditions receipt of federal Medicaid funds on Plaintiff States not \nproviding those funds to “prohibited entities.”  Section 71113(A).  But the Defund Provision fails \nto provide clear notice to Plaintiff States in two ways:  1) the definition of “prohibited entities” \nand the timing of the prohibition on federal reimbursements to such entities is impermissibly \nambiguous; and 2) the provision is an unprecedented incursion into Plaintiff States’ traditional \ndiscretion over the regulation of medicine that Plaintiff States could not have anticipated when \njoining Medicaid.  \nA.  The Defund Provision Fails to Provide Clear Notice \nThe Defund Provision does not provide clear notice about the scope of providers that \nqualify as “prohibited entities” or the timing for prohibitions on payments to such “prohibited \nentities.”  Although Planned Parenthood health centers are the clear target of the Defund \nProvision, Congress nevertheless crafted impermissibly ambiguous legislation to comply with \nthe budget reconciliation process.  As such, Plaintiff States have no way to determine 1) the full \nscope of the Defund Provision or 2) how to comply with its timing requirements. \nFirst, the Defund Provision fails to provide clear notice to Plaintiff States of which \nproviders qualify as “prohibited entities.”  Section 71113(b)(1) defines a “prohibited entity” as \nan “entity” that among other things, is an “essential community provider . . . primarily engaged \nin family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care,” that “provides for \nabortions” and received over $800,000 in Medicaid expenditures in 2023. Section 71113(A), (B).  \nThe Defund Provision also applies to those providers’ “affiliates.”  Id.  \nThe Defund Provision provides no guidance about how Plaintiff States are to determine if \na provider is “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 13 of 31\n \nmedical care.”  See, e.g., Doc. No. 62-15 at 7;  Doc. No. 62-20 at 8.  For example, details such as \nwhat percentage of services renders a provider “primarily” a provider of reproductive health \nservices; what counts as “family planning services”; and whether providers must be evaluated on \nthe basis of patients served or strictly by billing numbers all go unexplained by the Defund \nProvision, leaving Plaintiff States in the dark as to methods of determination.  Plaintiff States \nalso have no way to know what entities qualify under the criterion for receiving $800,000 in total \nMedicaid payments in 2023.  Many healthcare providers operate in multiple states and/or may \nsee patients from—and therefore receive Medicaid reimbursements from—multiple states.  But \nPlaintiff States only track their own Medicaid payments from state and federal funds; they do not \ntrack the total amount of Medicaid payments that providers who operate in multiple states may \nreceive.  See, e.g., Doc. No. 62-6 at 9; Doc. No. 62-15 at 7.  The Defund Provision provides no \nguidance about how the amount of Medicaid payments in 2023 is to be measured.  And if \nPlaintiff States are wrong in any of their interpretations, they risk Defendants requiring \nrepayment of federal reimbursements that Plaintiff States have already made.  See Doc. No. 61-4 \nat 4-5; see also Flores-Brennan Decl. (CO), Doc. No. 62-7 at 10; Doc. No. 62-13 at 9; Doc. No. \n62-15 at 7; Doc. No. 62-18 at 8-9.  \nFurther, the Defund Provision sweeps in all “affiliates” of providers that otherwise qualify \nas “prohibited entities.”  But Plaintiff States do not track the “affiliates” of Medicaid providers, \nparticularly if those “affiliates” operate outside of their respective borders.  See, e.g., Doc. No. \n62-15 at 7.  Nor could they, given the vagueness of the term “affiliate.”  Without further \nguidance from the provision, Plaintiff States can use only general resources to ascertain who to \ninclude as “affiliates.”  One dictionary defines “affiliate” expansively.  Affiliate, Merriam \nWebster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affiliate (last visited Sept. 12, \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 14 of 31\n \n2025).  The Defund Provision offers no limitation on the scope of the term nor does it provide \nguidance about the form of relationships that qualify.  Compare Section 71113 with 19 U.S.C. § \n1677(33) (defining term “affiliated” and “affiliated persons”).     \nThe position taken by Defendants in their litigation with PPFA about the term “affiliate” \nfurther muddles Plaintiff States’ obligations.  See PPFA Litigation Doc. No. 53.  There, \nDefendants argue that PPFA members who do not otherwise qualify as “prohibited entities” \nnevertheless could qualify as “affiliates” of qualifying members exclusively through membership \nin PPFA.  Id. at 27-30.  Defendants contend that they must “probe” the relationship between \nPPFA and its members to determine whether there is sufficient “control” for all PPFA members \nto qualify as “affiliates” of each other.  Id. at 27.  Even if Defendants could make that \ndetermination for PPFA members—the obvious intended target of the Defund Provision, see \nsupra Section Background.I.B—that determination says nothing about other potential \n“prohibited entities.”  This is not information Plaintiff States currently collect.  See, e.g., Doc. \nNo. 62-15 at 7; Doc. No. 62-18 at 8.  And it would require Plaintiff States to launch intrusive \nprobes into providers’ relationships and services that are wholly unrelated to the purpose of the \nMedicaid program, which is the delivery of essential healthcare to needy individuals.  See \nSchweiker v. Hogan, 457 U.S. 569, 590 (1982). \nViewing this provision from the perspective of Plaintiff State officials, the Defund \nProvision does not provide adequate notice about the conditions under which they can accept \nfederal Medicaid reimbursements.  It tasks Plaintiff States with not only examining whether \nproviders within their boundaries satisfy the criteria—which they cannot do—but also with \ndetermining whether providers have an association with entities that would otherwise qualify as \n“prohibited entities”—again, a nearly impossible task.  See Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 15 of 31\n \nP.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 219 (2022) (“Recipients cannot ‘knowingly accept’ the deal with the \nFederal Government unless they ‘would clearly understand … the obligations’ that would come \nalong with doing so.”); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981) \n(“There can, of course, be no knowing acceptance if a State is unaware of the conditions or is \nunable to ascertain what is expected of it.”). \nSecond, the Defund Provision fails to provide clear notice with regard to its irreconcilable \ntiming provisions.  The Defund Provision sets its “effective” date as the date of its enactment \n(i.e., July 4, 2025) but sets the date for determination of providers’ “prohibited entity” status as \nthe “first day of the first quarter after the date” of its enactment (i.e., October 1, 2025).3  Section \n71113(A)(i)-(iii).  In other words, the Defund Provision prohibits payments to “prohibited \nentities” as of July 4, despite the status of “prohibited entity” not being set until October 1, 2025.  \nBetween July 4 and October 1, however, Plaintiff States are obligated to make payments on \nproviders’ claims within thirty days of submission, see 42 C.F.R. § 447.45(d), and nothing in the \nDefund Provision requires CMS to provide notice to Plaintiff States of which providers qualify \nas “prohibited entities.”  As such, Plaintiff States may end up using federal Medicaid funds \nduring this period to reimburse providers that CMS later decides are “prohibited entities”—\nthereby requiring repayment of those funds.      \nDefendants’ arguments in the related PPFA litigation only underscore the irreconcilability.  \nSee PPFA Litigation Doc. No. 53 at 40-41.  They argue that “a Medicaid provider in any given \nstate can generally expect to receive payment from the state within 30 days of submitting a \nclaim,” at which point Plaintiff States “incur an expenditure to include in the state’s” reporting to \n \n3 Those three criteria are:  1) being a 501(c)(3) organization; 2) being an essential \ncommunity provider primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and \nrelated medical care; 3) and providing for abortions.  Section 71113(A)(i)-(iii). \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 16 of 31\n \nCMS.  Id. at 40.  But Defendants further explain that “under Section 71113, states will not know \nwhether a provider is a prohibited entity until October 1; thus, they will not be able to \ndefinitively deny any claims until that date.”  Id. at 41.  The only clue Defendants offer about \nhow States should proceed is to contend that CMS will “adjust[]” federal reimbursements by \nsometime in April 2026.  Id. at 41 n.3.  In other words, if Plaintiff States pay providers who have \nnot yet qualified as “prohibited entities” but ultimately are found to qualify, CMS will expect \nPlaintiff States to repay those funds.  Id. at 41 n.3.  But, as Defendants acknowledge, definitive \ninformation about providers’ status cannot be known until October 1.  Id. at 41; see also 42 \nC.F.R. § 447.45.  The Defund Provision thus fails to provide Plaintiff States with clear notice of \nthe conditions attached to the funding in question.  See Arlington, 548 U.S. at 296 (“States \ncannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are . . . ‘unable to ascertain.’”).  As such, the \nDefund Provision unconstitutionally fails to provide clear notice. \nB.  The Defund Provision Is an Unprecedented Incursion on State Authority \nthat States Could Not Have Anticipated at the Time They Entered into the \nMedicaid Program \nThe Defund Provision is unprecedented in the history of the Medicaid program.  By \nrestricting the providers who can receive federal Medicaid reimbursements, the Defund \nProvision steps into Plaintiff States’ traditional role governing the medical profession for the \nvery first time.  Congress cannot “surprise[e] participating States with post acceptance” \nconditions that so dramatically change the relationship between States and the federal \ngovernment.  Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 25.    \n“States have traditionally exercised primary responsibility over ‘matters of health and \nsafety,’ including the regulation of the practice of medicine.”  Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2227; cf. De \nBuono v. NYSA-ILA Med. & Clinical Servs. Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 814 (1997) (“[T]he historic \npolice powers of the State include the regulation of matters of health and safety”).  Consistent \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 17 of 31\n \nwith that traditional role, for the past sixty years, the Medicaid program has left to States the \ndetermination of which providers “qualify” for Medicaid participation.  42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(23)(A); Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2227.   \nThe Defund Provision, however, undercuts Plaintiff States’ traditional discretion in \ndetermining providers’ qualifications and usurped their policy judgments.  See Medina, 145 S. \nCt. at 2227; see also Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991) (“[T]he States retain substantial \nsovereign powers under our constitutional scheme, powers with which Congress does not readily \ninterfere.”).  In an unprecedented shift, the Defund Provision requires Plaintiff States to prohibit \nproviders from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursement based on federal criteria that have \nnothing to do with providers’ qualifications, looking instead to unrelated criteria:  their tax \nstatus; the types of services they provide, including services that Medicaid does not fund; their \nfunding level from 2023; and their affiliations with other providers.  See Section 71113(A), (B).  \nGiven that throughout the sixty-year history of Medicaid, States—not the federal government—\nhave determined whether providers “qualify” for the Medicaid program, Plaintiff States could \nnot have anticipated this type of unprecedented change.  See Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2227.  By \ndeeming a category of providers unfit for federal Medicaid reimbursement, the Defund Provision \nis wholly unprecedented, not just an “adjustment[] to the Medicaid program as it developed.”  \nNat’l Fed. of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 583 (2012); see also Barnett v. Short, 129 \nF.4th 534, 541 (8th Cir. 2025) (“[W]e consider whether a prospective funding recipient, at the \ntime it decided whether to accept federal dollars, would have been aware” of conditions).   \nII.  PLAINTIFF STATES ARE SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM \nBecause of the Defund Provision, Plaintiff States are “likely to suffer irreparable harm in \nthe absence of preliminary relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 18 of 31\n \n“‘Irreparable injury’ in the preliminary injunction context means an injury that cannot adequately \nbe compensated for either by a later-issued permanent injunction, after a full adjudication on the \nmerits, or by a later-issued damages remedy.”  Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan, 397 \nF.3d 56, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).  “District courts have broad discretion to evaluate the irreparability \nof alleged harm and to make determinations regarding the propriety of injunctive relief.”  K-Mart \nCorp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 915 (1st Cir. 1989).  States’ irreparable harm can \ninclude “obligation of new debt,” “inability to pay existing debt,” and “impediments to planning, \nhiring, and operations.” See New York v. Trump, 133 F.4th 51, 73 (1st Cir. 2025). \nA.  Plaintiff States’ Administrative Costs \nPlaintiff States are currently burdened with administrative costs to try to implement the \nDefund Provision and its wholly ambiguous terms.  These kind of “[u]nrecoverable compliance \ncosts” qualify as irreparable harm.  See State of Tenn. v. Dept. of Educ., 104 F.4th 577, 613 (6th \nCir. 2024); see also Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 432 (5th Cir. 2016) (“Indeed, ‘complying with \na regulation later held invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable \ncompliance costs.’”).  \nFor example, Hawaii “has already had to implement billing system changes and finance \nsystem holds” and has had to address inquiries due to the Defund Provision’s ambiguity.  Doc. \nNo. 62-10 at 5.  And Wisconsin will “need to update the financial reporting system to \nappropriately exclude” prohibited entities and “establish a process to identify if any other entity \nmeets the definition.”  Doc. No. 62-24 at 5.  New York is conducting a review of its claims \npayment and processing system to identify the necessary changes that will have to be made \nbecause no infrastructure currently exists to filter out New York providers falling under the \ndefinition of “prohibited entities.”  Doc. No. 62-20 at 7-8. Moreover, New York’s data \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 19 of 31\n \nmanagement information system that handles claims, payments, and other related data for the \nstate’s Medicaid program is extremely difficult to modify, with minor changes often taking over \n12 months.  Id.   \nOther Plaintiff States similarly are already undertaking, or will shortly have to undertake, \nadministrative burdens to try to comply.  See, e.g., Doc. No. 62-6 at 8-9; Doc. No. 62-7 at 9-10; \nDoc. No. 62-11 at 4; Doc. No. 62-13 at 9; Doc. No. 62-15 at 7; Doc. No. 62-18 at 7-8; Doc. No. \n62-19 at 9; Doc. No. 62-21 at 9-10; Fotinos Decl. (WA), Doc. No. 62-23 at 7-8.  These \nadministrative burdens cost Plaintiff States staff time and resources that Plaintiff States cannot \nrecoup from Defendants.  See, e.g., Doc. No. 62-6 at 7-8; Doc. No. 62-7 at 9-10; Doc. No. 62-10 \nat 5; Doc. No. 62-11 at 4; Doc. No. 62-13 at 9; Doc. No. 62-15 at 7-8; Doc. No. 62-18 at 7-8; \nDoc. No. 62-19 at 9; Doc. No. 62-20 at 7-8; Doc. No. 62-21 at 9-10; Doc. No. 62-23 at 8 Doc. \nNo. 62-24 at 5.  Plaintiff States can only avoid these costs by this Court enjoining the Defund \nProvision while its constitutionality is addressed.   \nFurther, even if Plaintiff States were able to administer the Defund Provision, it interferes \nwith  operation of their Medicaid programs by restricting Plaintiff States’ ability to decide which \nproviders qualify to participate in their State Medicaid programs and restricting States from \ndirecting federal funds to certain providers.  Such interference with States’ operation of their \nown programs qualifies as irreparable harm.  See, e.g., Ohio v. EPA, 144 S. Ct. 2040, 2053 \n(2024) (citing States’ “sovereign interests in regulating their own industries and citizens”). \nB.  Plaintiff States’ Increased Healthcare Costs \nThe Defund Provision also significantly impacts the healthcare ecosystems in Plaintiff \nStates.  By targeting providers who offer essential reproductive and family planning healthcare, \nthe Defund Provision will cause 1) a material decrease in providers offering such critical care; 2) \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 20 of 31\n \nleading to overwhelmed alternative health centers that cannot absorb those providers’ patients; 3) \nand those providers’ patients not receiving critical care, including screenings for STIs and \ncancer; 4) resulting in increased short- and long-term healthcare costs to Plaintiff States that \nconstitute irreparable harm.    \nFirst, by prohibiting federal Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood health centers and \nother “prohibited entity” health centers that were swept into Congress’ attack on Planned \nParenthood, many of those health centers will, at the very least, restrict treatment for Medicaid \npatients in Plaintiff States.  For example, PPFA has stated that the Defund Provision “is already \nforcing [PPFA) Members to turn away patients enrolled in Medicaid” and will result in its \nmembers having “to severely curtail the services they provide to many of their low-income \npatients.”  See Doc. No. 61-1 at 4; see also id. at 17; RJN Exs. 2, 3, Doc. No. 61-2 at 44, Doc. \nNo. 61-3 at 16; Groen Decl. (MI), Doc. No. 62-14 at 7.  Indeed, the brief periods when the \nDefund Provision was in effect before this Court’s preliminary injunction already caused the \nclosure of five Planned Parenthood health centers in California.  E. Connolly Decl., Ex. 4, Doc. \nNo. 62-4.  And Maine Family Planning (“MFP”), which has been swept into the Defund \nProvision, Doc. No. 62-13 at 7-8, has detailed how its clinics “are no longer accepting new \npatients enrolled in Medicaid who are seeking primary care” and will stop providing care to \nMedicaid patients by October 31, 2025.  RJN Ex. 5, Doc. No. 61-5 at 11, 12.  \nSecond, the loss of services that Planned Parenthood health centers and other “prohibited \nentities” provide to Medicaid patients will result in significant disruption to the healthcare \necosystems in Plaintiff States.  In 2022, Planned Parenthood health centers served up to 72% of \npatients in Plaintiff States who rely on government funding for seeking sexual and reproductive \nhealthcare.  Kavanaugh Decl., Doc. No. 62-5 at 16.  In eight of the Plaintiff States, Planned \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 21 of 31\n \nParenthood health centers served at least 50% of such patients.4  Id.  And in Maine, MFP and \nPlanned Parenthood of Northern New England (“PPNNE”) served 43% of all Medicaid patients \nreceiving family planning or reproductive healthcare.  Doc. No. 62-13 at 8.   \nBecause of the high volume of patients that Planned Parenthood health centers and other \npotential “prohibited entities” treat, other healthcare centers not targeted by the Defund Provision \nwill not be able to care for those patients.  Doc. No. 62-5 at 23-24; see also Doc. No. 62-6 at 10, \n26-27; Doc. No. 62-7 at 8; Halsey Decl. (CT), Doc. No. 62-8 at 7-8; Wilson Decl. (DE), Doc. \nNo. 62-9 at 6-7; Doc. No. 62-10 at 5-6; Doc. No. 62-13 at 8-9; Doc. No. 62-14 at 6-7; Woodrich \nDecl. (MN), Doc. No. 62-16 at 6; Bush Decl. (NC), Doc. No. 62-17 at 5; Doc. No. 62-18 at 6-7; \nDoc. No. 62-21 at 7; Sousa Decl. (RI), Doc. No. 62-22 at 5-6; Doc. No. 62-23 at 7, 9; Doc. No. \n62-24 at 4.  These alternative healthcare centers would have to increase their caseloads \nsignificantly:  federally qualified health centers (“FQHCs”) by 56%5; health departments by \n28%; hospitals by 53%; and other miscellaneous sites by 55%.  Doc. No. 62-5 at 23-24.  In seven \nof the Plaintiff States, FQHCs would have to increase their caseloads by more than 100% to \nabsorb the patients no longer treated by Planned Parenthood health centers,6 and in two other \nPlaintiff States, FQHCs would have to increase their caseloads by more than 80%.7  Id. at 24-25.    \nIn addition, likely “prohibited entities,” such as Planned Parenthood health centers, provide \nspecialized reproductive healthcare that alternative health centers do not.  Doc. No. 62-5 at 17-\n \n4 The eight states are California (49%), Connecticut (72%), Minnesota (66%), New \nJersey (58%), Oregon (57%), Vermont (68%), Washington (59%), and Wisconsin (59%).  Doc. \nNo. 62-5 at 16. \n5 FQHCs are “[f]ederally funded nonprofit health centers or clinics that serve medically \nunderserved areas and populations.”  See Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), \nHealthcare.gov, https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federally-qualified-health-center-fqhc/ (last \nvisited Sept. 11, 2025). \n6 Those seven states are Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, Vermont, Washington, and \nWisconsin.  Doc. No. 62-5 at 24. \n7 Those two states are California and Maryland.  Doc. No. 62-5 at 24. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 22 of 31\n \n18; see also Doc. No. 62-7 at 8.  For example, they are more likely than alternative health centers \nto offer 1) the widest range of contraceptive methods; 2) 12-month supplies of oral contraceptive \npills; 3) same-day IUD and contraceptive implant insertion; and 4) cervical cancer screenings, \nmedication for HIV prevention, and HPV vaccination.  Doc. No. 62-5 at 18-21.  Even if \nalternative health centers could extend their capacity to take up the additional patient caseload, \nthey would not provide the same specialized care to serve those patients’ needs.  Id.    \nThird, because of both the restriction of services at Planned Parenthood health centers and \nother “prohibited entities” and the improbability of alternative health centers absorbing the influx \nof patients, Medicaid-eligible patients in Plaintiff States are likely to face more barriers to \nhealthcare, which predictably will result in those patients foregoing early screenings and \ntreatments and Plaintiff States facing increased healthcare expenses.  See, e.g., Doc. No. 62-6 at \n10-11; Doc. No. 62-7 at 10; Doc. No. 62-8 at 8; Doc. No. 62-9 at 6-7; Doc. No. 62-10 at 5-6; \nBoyle Decl. (MA), Doc. No. 62-12 at 6; Doc. No. 62-14 at 7-8; Doc. No. 62-13 at 10-11; Doc. \nNo. 62-16 at 6; Doc. No. 62-17 at 6; Doc. No. 62-19 at 7-8; Doc. No. 62-20 at 9-10; Doc. No. \n62-21 at 7-8; Doc. No. 62-22 at 6; Doc. No. 62-23 at 9; Doc. No. 62-24 at 4.  After Planned \nParenthood health centers lost Title X federal funding following the 2019 Title X Final Rule, \ntheir patients were less likely to have received recent contraceptive care and were less likely to \nreport use of a contraceptive method with which they were satisfied.  Doc. No. 62-5 at 26-27.   \nBoth Iowa and Texas have independently excluded Planned Parenthood health centers \nfrom their state Medicaid funding, and studies following those decisions demonstrate the \nlikelihood that low-income patients will not get necessary care.  Id. at 27-31.  There was an 86% \ndecline in low-income patients served within Iowa’s family planning program after the policy \nchange.  Id. at 27.  And Iowa saw spikes in cases of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in the \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 23 of 31\n \nyear following the policy change.  Id. at 34.  Likewise, in Texas, patients had to pay more for \ncontraceptive services after that state’s exclusion of Planned Parenthood health centers from its \nMedicaid program, and there was both a significant decrease in the use of long-acting \ncontraception and a concomitant increase in Medicaid-covered childbirths.  Id. at 30-31.  \nThe restriction of services at Planned Parenthood health centers and other potential \n“prohibited entities” will also result in patients not receiving critical testing and treatment of \nsexually transmitted infections (“STIs”) and reproductive cancers.  Id. at 31-32; see also Doc. \nNo. 62-21 at 7-8 (“each additional 10 minutes of driving time” “associated with significant \ndecreases in the receipt of preventive care”).  The services that Planned Parenthood health \ncenters provided in 2023 alone accounted for the prevention of an estimated 82,000 chlamydia \ninfections; 9,500 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease; 820 ectopic pregnancies; 1,600 cases of \ninfertility; 130 HIV infections; and 200 cervical cancer cases.  Doc. No. 62-5 at 33. \nThe decrease in preventative care for these patients will result in increased healthcare costs \nfor Plaintiff States in both the immediate and longer term.  See, e.g., Doc. No. 62-6 at 10; Doc. \nNo. 62-16 at 7-8.  For example, a study of Medicaid claims data showed that the cost for \ncontraception is only 6.6% of the cost for unintended pregnancies.  Doc. No. 62-21 at 9.  Another \nstudy looking at publicly funded family planning services showed that the care patients receive at \nthose visits results in net government savings of $7.00 for every $1.00 that governments spend.  \nId.  And treatment for later-stage breast and cervical cancer is much more expensive than \nscreenings and early or preventative treatment.  RJN Exs. 6, 7, Doc. No. 61-6, Doc. No. 61-7. \nFourth, because of the Defund Provision’s impact on their healthcare ecosystems, Plaintiff \nStates must make a difficult choice (if their fiscs even allow them to make this choice) to either:  \n1) supplement the withheld federal Medicaid funds with money from their own coffers, thereby \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 24 of 31\n \nnot only foregoing federal funds to which they would otherwise be entitled but also diverting \nresources away from other programs, such schools, transportation funds, and emergency \nservices; or 2) not supplement those funds, with Planned Parenthood health centers and other \npotential “prohibited entities” predictably not seeing Medicaid patients (or closing altogether), \nand those Medicaid patients not receiving preventative care that avoids long-term higher \nhealthcare costs.  See, e.g., Doc. No. 62-6 at 11; Doc. No. 62-7 at 11; Doc. No. 62-8 at 8-9; Doc. \nNo. 62-9 at 6-7; Doc. No. 62-10 at 6; Doc. No. 62-13 at 10-11; Doc. No. 62-14 at 8; Doc. No. \n62-15 at 6-7; Doc. No. 62-16 at 6-8; Doc. No. 62-17 at 6; Doc. No. 62-18 at 9; Doc. No. 62-19 at \n9; Doc. No. 62-20 at 9-10; Doc. No. 62-21 at 8-9; Doc. No. 62-22 at 6; Doc. No. 62-23 at 9; Doc. \nNo. 62-24 at 6.  The Defund Provision thus risks significant irreparable harm to Plaintiff States.  \nSee Cook Cnty., Ill. v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 208, 233 (7th Cir. 2020) (“significant increase in costs,” \n“higher . . . risk” of “communicable diseases,” and having to “divert resources away from \nexisting programs” qualify as irreparable harm). \nIII.  BALANCE OF EQUITIES AND PUBLIC INTEREST SUPPORT THE PLAINTIFF STATES’ \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION REQUEST \nThe equities and public interest further favor the Plaintiff States’ requested relief.  See, \ne.g., Does 1-6 v. Mills, 16 F.4th 20, 37 (1st Cir. 2021) (these factors “merge when the \n[g]overnment is the opposing party”).  “The public has an important interest in making sure \ngovernment agencies follow the law.”  Neighborhood Ass’n of the Back Bay, Inc. v. Fed. Transit \nAdmin., 407 F. Supp. 2d 323, 343 (D. Mass. 2005).  In contrast, CMS has “no interest in \nenforcing an unconstitutional law, [and] the public interest is harmed by the enforcement of laws \nrepugnant to the United States Constitution.”  N.H. Indonesian Community Support v. Trump, \n765 F. Supp. 3d 102, 112 (D.N.H. 2025) (alteration in original). \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 25 of 31\n \nBoth the balance of equities and the public interest favor Plaintiff States’ requested \npreliminary injunction.8  As Plaintiff States explained above, the Defund Provision fails to \nprovide them with clear notice and therefore is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’ \nspending power.  See supra Section Arg.I.A.  And Plaintiff States are already suffering and will \ncontinue to suffer irreparable harm in the form of administrative burdens and immediate and \nlonger-term costs to their public fiscs in the form of increased public healthcare costs if the \nDefund Provision remains in effect.  See supra Section Arg.II. \nIn contrast, a preliminary injunction would not impose monetary harm on the federal \ngovernment.9  Defendants are theoretically willing to fund the underlying care that the \n“prohibited entities” offer, just not when Planned Parenthood health centers happen to provide it.  \nAnd given the disruptions to Plaintiff States’ healthcare ecosystems and the resulting negative \nimpact on patient healthcare, see supra Section Arg.II.B, the public interest weighs heavily \nagainst implementation of the Defund Provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant Plaintiff States’ preliminary injunction request. \n \n \n \n8 Nor does the timing of Plaintiff States’ motion change the balance of equities.  The \nCourt’s preliminary injunction in the PPFA litigation ensured that Plaintiff States could continue \nproviding federal reimbursement to Planned Parenthood health centers that are the targets of the \nDefund Provision and also provide a significant proportion of Medicaid-funded family planning \nand reproductive healthcare services in Plaintiff States.  See supra Section Arg.II.B.  The First \nCircuit’s stay of that injunction makes even more imminent the potential harms from the Defund \nProvision, thereby justifying Plaintiff States’ motion at this time.  \n9 The Court should not require a bond for issuance of the preliminary injunction.  The \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure ordinarily require “security in an amount the court considers \nproper” before a preliminary injunction may issue. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). “However, the First \nCircuit has recognized an exception to the bond requirement in suits to enforce important federal \nrights or public interests, as is precisely the case here.” New York v. McMahon, 784 F. Supp. 3d \n311, 373 (D. Mass. 2025).  \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 63     Filed 09/24/25     Page 26 of 31\n \nDate:  September 24, 2025  Respectfully Submitted,  \n   \nROB BONTA \nANDREA JOY CAMPBELL \nAttorney General \nAttorney General \nState of California \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts \n \n \n/s/ Erica Connolly \n/s/ Allyson Slater                                      ERICA CONNOLLY* \nALLYSON SLATER (BBO No. 704545)  Deputy Attorney General  \nDirector, Reproductive Justice Unit  NELI PALMA*  \nSenior Assistant Attorney General  \nMORGAN CARMEN (BBO No. Pending) \nKARLI EISENBERG* \nAssistant Attorney General \nSupervising Deputy Attorney General  \nOffice of the Attorney General  \n1300 I Street \nOne Ashburton Place, 20th Floor   Sacramento, CA 95814 \nBoston, MA 02108   (916) 210-7755 \n(617) 963-2811  Erica.Connolly@doj.ca.gov \nAllyson.slater@mass.gov  Attorneys for Plaintiff State of California \n \nAttorneys for Plaintiff Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts \n \n \n   \n   \nLETITIA JAMES  WILLIAM TONG \nAttorney General  Attorney General \nState of New York  State of Connecticut \n    \n /s/ Galen Sherwin   /s/ Alma Nunley \nGALEN SHERWIN*  ALMA NUNLEY* \nSpecial Counsel for Reproductive Justice  Special Counsel for Reproductive Rights \nRABIA MUQADDAM*  JANELLE R.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 65     Filed 09/29/25     Page 1 of 11\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS \n \n   \nSTATE OF CALIFORNIA, et al.,   \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \n   \nv.   \n  No. 1:25-cv-12118-IT \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND   \nHUMAN SERVICES, et al., \n \n \nDefendants. \nJOINT MOTION FOR A BRIEFING SCHEDULE ON  \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND TO STAY \nDEFENDANTS’ DEADLINE TO RESPOND TO THE COMPLAINT PENDING \nRESOLUTION OF THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION MOTION \n  Plaintiff States and Defendants jointly move the Court to set the briefing schedule on \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for  a Preliminary Injunction (ECF  No. 60) proposed below and to  stay \nDefendants’ obligation to file a response to the Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12 pending resolution of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.  In support, the parties \nstate as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs filed the instant action on July 29, 2025 and completed service on August 14, \n2025.  See ECF No. 1. \n2.  On September 24, 2025, Plaintiffs moved for a Preliminary Injunction.  ECF No. 60. \n3.  The  parties thereafter agreed that  Defendants’ response to  Plaintiffs’  Motion for  a \nPreliminary Injunction shall be due on October 15, 2025. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 65     Filed 09/29/25     Page 2 of 11\n4.  The parties further agreed that Plaintiff’s reply shall be due on October 29, 2025. \n5.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(a)(2), the United States and its officers and \nemployees sued in their official capacity must respond to a complaint within 60 days after service \non the United States attorney. \n6.  Because Plaintiffs completed service on August 14, 2025, Defendants’ current deadline to \nrespond to the Complaint is October 14, 2025. \n7.  The parties respectfully request a  stay of Defendants’ obligation to respond to  the \nComplaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 pending resolution of the motion for a \npreliminary injunction.  There is good cause to grant the requested stay during the pendency of \nPlaintiffs’ motion.  See Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997) (stating that a “[d]istrict Court \nhas broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its power to control its own docket”).  \nAny order on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction necessarily will inform Defendants’ \nresponse to the Complaint and shape the next steps in the litigation.  Accordingly, considerations \nof party and judicial economy would benefit from resolution of the motion for preliminary \ninjunction before moving on to further proceedings in this case. \n8.  The parties propose that they file a joint status report addressing further proceedings within \n14 days of the issuance of an order resolving Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \n \nWHEREFORE, the parties respectfully request that this Motion be allowed and the Court \nenter the agreed-upon briefing schedule proposed above—whereby Defendants’ response to \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction will be due on October 15, 2025 and Plaintiffs’ \nReply will  be due on October 29, 2025—and stay Defendants’ deadline to  respond to the \nComplaint pending resolution of the preliminary injunction motion. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12118-IT     Document 65     Filed 09/29/25     Page 3 of 11\nDated: September 29, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  BRETT A.
