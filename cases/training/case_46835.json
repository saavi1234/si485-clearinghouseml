          "description": "MINUTE ORDER (paperless), upon consideration of plaintiffs' 17 Emergency Motion for Clarification of the Denial of the TRO, which motion helpfully and expeditiously includes defendants' statement in opposition, DENYING plaintiffs' motion. Whether framed as a motion for clarification, as presented by plaintiffs, or a motion for reconsideration, as defendants urge, see Pls.' Mot. at 2, plaintiffs' motion is denied because plaintiffs were afforded no relief on their motion for the temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") that may require \"clarification,\" as explained orally and for the reasons stated on the record, see 18 Tr. of July 31, 2025, TRO Hearing (\"TRO Tr.\"), at 56:19-66:5. Plaintiffs explain their \"understand[ing]\" that the Court \"determined [] there was no irreparable harm because Plaintiffs currently have the option to draw down funds unless and until the Policy Notice is enforced against them,\" id. at 1, citing as the basis for this determination that defendants made clear \"it is not independently unlawful to draw down funds with a certification 'under protest' as they did when 'fil[ing] their continuing grant applications,'\" id. (quoting Defs.' Opp'n Mot. TRO at 2, ECF No. 14). The Court indeed used this example as one reason why the plaintiffs' showing of irreparable harm was inadequate. See 18 TRO Tr. at 63:20-64:14 (\"Plaintiffs... also frame their irreparable harm as the difficult choice they have between foregoing the sole funding for their sex education programs or drawing down funds at the risk of arbitrary enforcement..., but that choice does not constitute irreparable harm.\"). Contrary to plaintiffs' suggestion, however, this was not the sole basis for the denial of the requested TRO. See id. at 62:15-63:14 (explaining how neither plaintiffs nor the Court know how the challenged July 1 Program Policy Notice will be interpreted and enforced). To be sure, plaintiffs are rightly concerned that withdrawing funds accompanied by plaintiffs' certification of compliance poses a risk of enforcement consequences, but defendants, not the Court, are the source of identifying the option of making such certification \"under protest,\" Defs.' Opp'n Mot. TRO at 2, raising the possibility that following this path may mitigate plaintiffs' risks down the line, though this Court offers no opinion on this possibility.The bottom line is that the July 1, 2025, Teenage Pregnancy Prevention (\"TPP\") Program Policy Notice has not been enforced against plaintiffs and, as defendants pointed out, this Notice is \"not self-effectuating.\" See 18 TRO Tr. at 47:22-23. The risk that such enforcement may occur in a form that is existentially threatening to plaintiffs' TPP programs, at some possible point in the future, possibly after review by the agency of, and possible conferral among plaintiffs and the agency about any possible alterations to, plaintiffs' program materials, rests on too many possibilities and, consequently, is too speculative to constitute the \"certain and great\" concrete, imminent irreparable harm required for the extraordinary emergency injunctive relief requested. Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Signed by Judge Beryl A. Howell on August 2, 2025. (lcbah4)"

Defendants move to transfer this case to Judge Kelly under D.D.C. Local Rule 40.5(c)(2), which allows for transferring of \"related cases\" to the judge \"having the earlier case.\" See 19 Defs.' Mot. at 1, 4. Judge Kelly presided over a case involving the plaintiffs here as well as other Planned Parenthood entities challenging guidance issued by HHS in March 2025 regarding plaintiffs' applications for annual continuation funding for their Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program grants. See Planned Parenthood of Greater N.Y. v. HHS, No. 25-cv-1334 (TJK), Complaint, ECF No. 1 (May 1, 2025). The plaintiffs in the prior case filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which was denied in late June due to a lack of irreparable harm, see id., 2025 WL 1768100 (D.D.C. June 26, 2025), and Judge Kelly then set an expedited summary judgment briefing schedule with briefs set to be ripe August 21, 2025, see id., Min. Order (July 8, 2025). After plaintiffs' grants were approved on July 2, 2025, plaintiffs dismissed that case, despite a Program Policy Notice being issued the same day articulating similar substantive requirements to those in the challenged application guidance. See id., Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, ECF No. 34 (July 11, 2025). The case before Judge Kelly was closed on July 14, 2025. A subset of those plaintiffs later challenged that Program Policy Notice issued on July 2, 2025, in the instant case, which upon filing on July 29, 2025, was randomly assigned to this Court. See 1 Complaint. Similar subject matters and similar parties, as present here, do not make the cases \"related\" under the Local Rules and thus do not warrant transfer. Under Local Rule 40.5(a)(4), where a case is dismissed \"and a second case is filed involving the same parties and relating to the same subject matter,\" the second case shall be deemed related to the dismissed case. That rule has been strictly interpreted such that \"'the same parties' means 'identical parties,'\" not parties in interest and not overlapping parties. Wilderness Soc'y v. Bernhardt, No. 20-cv-1176 (BAH), 2021 WL 2849635, at *2 (D.D.C. June 2, 2020) (emphasis added) (quoting Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, No. 2-cv-928 (RCL), 2002 WL 31100839, at *1 (D.D.C.

Plaintiffs here are Planned Parenthood of Greater New York; Planned Parenthood California Central Coast; and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Inc. Plaintiffs in the other case, 25-cv-1334, are those three parties plus two additional Planned Parenthood entities: Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, and Kentucky; and Planned Parenthood Mar Monte. These two additional parties make the parties to the two cases not identical, but merely overlapping, and therefore the cases are technically not related under Local Rule 40.5(a)(4). Transfer based on the related case rule is therefore not appropriate here. Signed by Judge Beryl A. Howell on August 13, 2025. (lcbah4)"

They sued HHS and its secretary under the Due Process Clause and the Administrative Procedure Act in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On June 26, 2025, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that plaintiffs would not face irreparable harm for at least a few more months. On July 11, 2025, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Filed on July 29, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this lawsuit was brought against HHS and its Secretary as a refiling of the May 12 action and renews the challenge to the federal government&rsquo;s authority to impose new ideological and policy-based conditions on public health grant funding. The plaintiffs asserted claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that the policy was &ldquo;arbitrarily and capriciously&rdquo; imposed and lacked congressional authorization, and under the Fifth Amendment, alleging the policy was vague and retroactively applied after the grant cycle had begun. Judge Beryl A. Howell was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs challenged content-based restrictions in the new policy, including an anti-DEI mandate, a prohibition on certain LGBTQ+ content, and a ban on material that \"encourages, normalizes, or promotes sexual activity for minors.\" They alleged that the mandate threatened grantees with suspension, termination, and potential claw-back of previously allocated funds. Accessing approved funding required certifying compliance with the mandate. They described their position as an &ldquo;impossible situation&rdquo;: comply with requirements they believed would compromise their mission, or forgo TPP funds, risking program cuts and layoffs.</p>\r\n<p>Alongside the complaint, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the new policy.

The court further found that the challenged policy had not yet been enforced against the plaintiffs and was &ldquo;not self-effectuating.&rdquo; On August 11, 2025, the defendants moved to transfer the case to Judge Kelly, who presided over Planned Parenthood of Greater New York v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, No. 1:25-cv-01334. The court denied the motion on August 13, ruling that the present case was not related to the earlier, dismissed action due to all of the parties not being the same.</p>\r\n<p>On August 25, 2025 plaintiffs moved for summary judgment and asked the court to vacate the policy in its entirety due to it being &ldquo;contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, unconstitutionally vague, and ultra vires.&rdquo; The government then proceeded to file their own motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\r\n<p>The case remains ongoing.</p>",

This case challenges the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) \nunlawful  imposition  of  sweeping  new  requirements  on  grantees  under  Tier  1  of  the  Teen \nPregnancy  Prevention  (TPP)  Program,  a  successful  evidence-based  public  health  initiative \nintended  to  reduce  unintended  teen  pregnancy  and  associated  risk  factors.  Plaintiffs—three \nnonprofits that receive funding from the Tier 1 program to provide sexual education programs \nacross the country—bring this action to challenge Defendants’ unlawful attempts to rewrite the \nTPP Program’s requirements in ways that would fundamentally undermine the program. \n2.  The same day HHS approved Plaintiffs’ continued funding through June 2026, \nHHS  published  the  OASH  Teen  Pregnancy  Prevention  Program  Policy  Notice  (Program \nMandate), which upended the statutory framework governing the TPP Program by conditioning \ncontinued access to funding on compliance with harmful mandates that are contrary to law, and \nthat directly contravene the TPP Program’s purpose—to provide effective, medically accurate \nprogramming to reduce teen pregnancy and associated health risks.  \n3.  HHS’s actions represent a pattern of agency overreach that threatens to gut a \nsuccessful, bipartisan, evidence-based public health program. Through these agency actions, HHS \nhas imposed novel and undefined requirements, including that grantees “align” their programs \nwith all current Presidential Executive Orders—regardless of relevance, legality, or scientific \nvalidity—and introduce a host of additional content-based restrictions that are vague, unrelated to \nthe purpose of and fundamentally incompatible with the statutory mandate Congress  established \nfor the TPP Program. \n4.  HHS’s unlawful new Program Mandate threatens grantees that fail to comply with \nits requirements with suspension, termination, and other consequences including the claw-back of \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 3 of 51\nalready allocated funds. But these new programmatic requirements are not only unlawful, they are \nalso unworkable. They force grantees to guess how the agency will enforce a requirement \nmandating “alignment,” to censor medically accurate and inclusive content, and to abandon \nprogramming that has already been rigorously evaluated and approved by HHS itself. \n5.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief on both administrative law and \nconstitutional grounds—to preserve the integrity of the TPP Program, to protect the communities \nthey serve, and to ensure that federal funding decisions are made based on law and science. \n6.  HHS’s actions are unlawful and dangerous. They jeopardize years of progress in \nreducing teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, particularly among underserved \ncommunities. They force grantees to choose between compromising their missions or losing \ncritical funding. And they send a chilling message: that evidence, expertise, and equity can be \ndiscarded in favor of ideology. \n7.  This Court should not allow it. Plaintiffs respectfully ask the Court to enjoin the \nenforcement of the Program Mandate, declare it unlawful, and, in doing so, preserve the ability of \nPlaintiffs to continue delivering the high-quality, evidence-based programming that Congress \nintended the TPP Program to support. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331, because the action arises under federal law, including the U.S. Constitution and the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq. An actual controversy exists between \nthe parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), and this Court may grant declaratory relief, \ninjunctive relief, and other appropriate relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 and 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 704-06. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 4 of 51\n9.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because this action seeks \nrelief against federal agencies and officials acting in their official capacities; at least one defendant \nresides in this district; and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim \noccurred in this district. \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff Planned Parenthood of Greater New York (PPGNY) is a not-for-profit \ncorporation organized under the laws of New York. PPGNY provides high-quality, affordable, \nevidence-based sexual health care and education throughout New York. PPGNY was awarded a \nfive-year TPP grant in June 2023. PPGNY’s request for year three funding was approved on July \n2, 2025.  \n11.  Plaintiff Planned Parenthood California Central Coast (PPCCC) is a not-for-\nprofit  corporation  organized  under  the  laws  of  California.  PPCCC  provides  high-quality, \naffordable, evidence-based sexual health care and education in three counties along the Central \nCoast of California. PPCCC’s mission is to improve its communities’ sexual health outcomes \nthrough healthcare, education, and advocacy. PPCCC was awarded a five-year TPP grant in June \n2023. PPCCC’s request for year three funding was approved on July 2, 2025. \n12.  Plaintiff  Planned  Parenthood  of  the  Heartland  (PPH)  is  a  not-for-profit \norganization organized under the laws of Minnesota. PPH provides high-quality, affordable, \nevidence-based sexual health care and education throughout Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North \nDakota, and South Dakota. PPH’s mission is to provide, promote, and protect reproductive and \nsexual health through high quality care, education, and advocacy. PPH was awarded a five-year \nTPP grant in June 2023. PPH’s request for for year three funding was approved on July 2, 2025. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 5 of 51\n13.  Defendant HHS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government \nand is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). HHS is the federal agency responsible \nfor  awarding  and  administering  funds  under  the  TPP  Program.  Since  2019,  the  Office  of \nPopulation Affairs, within the Department of Health and Human Services, has administered the \nTPP Program. \n14.  Defendant Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is Secretary of HHS and is sued in his official \ncapacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA. Teenage Pregnancy in the United States  \n15.  While unintended teenage pregnancy rates in the United States have steadily \ndecreased since the 1960s, teenage pregnancy continues to be a “significant public health concern” \nin  this  country  “because  of  the  range  of  health,  social,  and  economic  effects  adolescent \nchildbearing can have on adolescents, their children, and broader society.”1  \n16.  At the time Congress passed the TPP Program, “teen childbearing in the U.S. cost[] \ntaxpayers (federal, state, and local) at least $9.4 billion annually.”2 These costs included direct \ncosts of supporting perinatal and infant healthcare as well as costs related to public assistance, \nfoster care, and other services needed by teen parents and their children. \n \n1 Alexandria K. Mickler & Jessica Tollestrup, Cong. Rsrch. Serv., R45184, Teen Births in the \nUnited  States:  Overview  and  Recent  Trends,  at  1  (2025),  https://www.congress.gov/crs-\nproduct/R45184. \n2  OAH,  HHS,  Results  from  the  OAH  Teen  Pregnancy  Prevention  Program, \nhttps://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/tpp-results-factsheet.pdf. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 6 of 51\n17.  Public  health  organizations,  including  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and \nPrevention, agree that reducing unintended teenage pregnancy and preventing sexually transmitted \ninfections (STIs) is in the best interest of not only teenagers, but society as a whole.3 \n18.  Since the 1980s, Congress has authorized—and HHS has administered—programs \nwith a focus on adolescent pregnancy prevention.4 \nB. The TPP Program \n19.  In 2009, Congress created the TPP Program to fund a wide array of evidence-based, \nscientifically  rigorous  approaches  to  combating  unintended  teen  pregnancy  and  additional \nevaluation and development of evidence-based programs.5 Congress designed the TPP Program \n“to  create  evidence-based  social  policy  initiatives  to  improve  policymaking  and  program \noutcomes” using “new initiatives to build rigorous data, rather than treating evaluation as an \nafterthought[.]”6  \n20.  Consistent with those objectives, Congress initially appropriated $110 million in \nfunds to the TPP Program in fiscal year (FY) 2010, directing that such funds “shall be for making \ncompetitive contracts and grants to public and private entities to fund medically accurate and age \nappropriate programs that reduce teen pregnancy and for the Federal costs associated with \nadministering and evaluating such contracts and grants.”7 \n \n3 Jessica Tollestrup, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R45183, Adolescent Pregnancy: Federal Prevention \nPrograms 1 (2024), https:// www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45183. \n4 Id. \n5 Id. \n6 Evelyn M. Kappeler & Amy Feldman Farb, Historical Context for the Creation of the Office of \nAdolescent Health and the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, 54 J. ADOLESC. HEALTH S1, S2 \n(2014). \n7 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-117, 123 Stat. 3034, 3253 (2009). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 7 of 51\n21.  HHS has consistently incorporated and described the reduction of STIs as part of \nthe goal and objective of the program.8  \n22.  Congress requires HHS to fund two tiers of TPP Programs, “Tier 1” and “Tier 2.”  \n23.  Tier 1 grantees “replicat[e]” “medically accurate and age appropriate programs” \nthat have “been proven effective through rigorous evaluation to reduce teenage pregnancy, \nbehavioral  risk  factors  underlying  teenage  pregnancy,  or  other  associated  risk  factors.” \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460,  671 (2024). \n24.  HHS designates which programs are eligible for replication by Tier 1 grantees. \nPrograms eligible for “replication” are identified by HHS through the agency’s Teen Pregnancy \nPrevention Evidence Review (TPPER) process, a rigorous process akin to expert peer review.9 \nHHS then puts the eligible Tier 1 programs on a list, and applicants must in turn select from this \nmenu of HHS-designated options when making their project proposals (i.e., their proposals for \nimplementation of HHS’s approved programs).   \n25.  Tier 2 grantees are responsible for “develop[ing], replicat[ing], refin[ing], and \ntest[ing]”  new  “medically  accurate  and  age  appropriate  programs”  “for  preventing  teenage \npregnancy.”  138 Stat. at 671.  In other words, “Tier 2 lets grantees test new programs, and \nprograms that prove effective then become eligible for Tier 1.” Planned Parenthood of Greater \nWash. & N. Idaho v. HHS (PPGWNI), 946 F.3d 1100, 1106 (9th Cir. 2020).  \n \n8  See  OASH,  OPA,  About  the  Teen  Pregnancy  Prevention  Program,  HHS, \nhttps://opa.hhs.gov/grant-programs/teen-pregnancy-prevention-program/about-tpp-program  (last \nvisited July 29, 2025); see also OASH, OPA, Updated Findings from the HHS Teen Pregnancy \nPrevention  Evidence  Review,  HHS,  https://opa.hhs.gov/research-evaluation/teen-pregnancy-\nprevention-program-evaluations/tpp-evidence-review (last visited July 29, 2025). \n9 OASH, OPA, Updated Findings from the HHS Teen Pregnancy Prevention Evidence Review, \nsupra n.8.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 8 of 51\n26.  TPP Program grant recipients, including Plaintiffs in this case, receive project \nfunding through two types of application processes: a competitive award cycle and an annual non-\ncompetitive continuing award process.  \n27.  Consistent  with  HHS’s  regulations,  45  C.F.R.  §  52.6,  the  TPP  Program’s \ncompetitive award cycle necessarily begins with a notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), by \nwhich the agency declares its intention to award funds and outlines the program goals, objectives, \nand conditions for applying. See, e.g., HHS, OASH, OPA, Advancing Equity in Adolescent Health \nthrough Evidence-Based Teen Pregnancy Prevention Programs and Services, Notice of Funding \nOpportunity, AH-TP1-23-001 (2023 NOFO), at 5-6 (attached hereto as Ex. A).  \n28.  HHS grants these awards for a “project period,” during which HHS “intends to \nsupport the project without requiring the project to recompete for funds.” 45 C.F.R. § 52.6(c).  \n29.  Each  year,  grantees  submit  a  non-competing  continuation  award  application \nconsisting of “a progress report for the current budget year, and work plan, budget and budget \njustification for the upcoming year.” 2023 NOFO, Ex. A at 56.  \n30.  Continuous funding is “contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory \nprogress of the project, adequate stewardship of Federal funds, and the best interests of the \nGovernment.” 2023 NOFO, Ex. A at 17. \nC. Plaintiffs’ TPP Programs  \n31.  PPGNY’s TPP Program: PPGNY operates a Tier 1 TPP program with annual \nfunding of approximately $1,091,185. Through its project, Supporting Teens’ Access and Rights \n(STAR), PPGNY works to advance health equity and to improve the sexual health outcomes of \nyouth in New York City. The project replicates age-appropriate, medically accurate, and evidence-\nbased education programs across a network of PPGNY’s partners in 15 community districts \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 9 of 51\nthroughout New York City and includes a parent-to-parent peer education component for parents, \nguardians, and other adults in young people’s lives. Programming is offered in three settings: \nmiddle and high schools, after school and out-of-school time programs offered by community-\nbased organizations, and residential facilities serving youth experiencing homelessness. \n32.  PPGNY implements various evidence-based programs selected from the HHS-\napproved  list  resulting  from  its  TPPER  process,  which  were  determined  to  be  culturally \nappropriate and proven effective to impact sexual risk behaviors within the target populations \nidentified by PPGNY. PPGNY’s most recent non-competing continuation award application (NCC \nApplication) for year three of this five-year project was approved on July 2, 2025.  \n33.  PPCCC’s TPP Program: PPCCC operates a Tier 1 TPP program with annual \nfunding of approximately $798,636. Through its project, “Central Coast Comprehensive Sex \nEducation”  (CSEC),  PPCCC  has  implemented  a  systems-based  teen  pregnancy  prevention \ninitiative with overarching goals of improving sexual health outcomes, promoting positive youth \ndevelopment and empowerment, and advancing health equity and inclusivity for adolescents, their \nfamilies,  and  communities  through  replication  of  medically  accurate  and  age-appropriate \nevidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs. CSEC is focused on underserved areas of \nthe  Central  Coast  region  in  three  California  counties.  It  aims  to  provide  the  marginalized \ncommunities on the Central Coast with inclusive, culturally relevant, and medically accurate sex \neducation.  \n34.

PPCCC’s most recent NCC Application for year three of this five-year project was \napproved on July 2, 2025.  \n35.  PPH’s TPP Program: PPH operates a Tier 1 TPP program with annual funding of \napproximately  $773,619.  PPH’s  TPP  project,  titled  “Community-Responsive,  Youth-Driven \nComprehensive Sexual and Reproductive Health Interventions to Achieve Optimal Health for \nAdolescents in Western Iowa and Eastern Nebraska,” was designed to implement evidence-based \nprograms in each community served; to mobilize parents, adults, and communities through health \nfairs and training; and to provide continuous quality improvement by measuring outcomes. \n36.  PPH  implements  various  evidence-based  programs  selected  from  the  HHS-\napproved  list  resulting  from  its  TPPER  process,  which  were  determined  to  be  culturally \nappropriate and proven effective to impact sexual risk behaviors within the target populations \nidentified by PPH. PPH’s most recent NCC Application for year three of this five-year project was \napproved on July 2, 2025.  \nD. Defendants’ Imposition of Unlawful Requirements on the TPP Program \n37.  Over the past several months, HHS has engaged in a pattern of escalating efforts to \nundermine the statutory goals of the TPP Program—first through the imposition on Plaintiffs’ \nNCC applications of an Executive Order “alignment” requirement, and now through a sweeping \nPolicy Mandate that not only cements the Executive Order “alignment” requirement as a condition \nof continued funding, but also introduces a host of additional unlawful and harmful restrictions \nthat  invite  arbitrary  enforcement  and  are  fundamentally  incompatible  with  the  statutory \nrequirements of the TPP Program. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 11 of 51\nHHS Issues the Tier 1 NCC Notice and Litigation Ensues \n38.  On March 31, 2025, roughly two weeks before the April 15, 2025, Tier 1 NCC \napplication deadline for year three of the current five-year grant cycle, OPA unexpectedly emailed \nTPP Tier 1 funding recipients an updated NCC Notice, imposing, for the first time, a requirement \nthat Tier 1 recipients “align” their programs with all Executive Orders.10 \n39.  PPCCC and PPH made some modifications to their programs in response to the \nunlawful new requirements in the NCC Notice. PPGNY did not make any changes. Plaintiffs all \ntimely submitted their NCC applications under protest, and made explicit that they were submitting \ntheir applications without certifying “alignment” with Executive Orders.  \n40.  On May 1, 2025, PPGNY, PPCCC, and PPH filed suit alongside other TPP Tier 1 \ngrantees challenging the imposition of the alignment requirement to the Tier 1 NCC application \nprocess. See Plaintiffs’ Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Planned Parenthood of \nGreater N.Y. v. HHS (PPGNY), No. 25-1334 (TJK) (D.D.C. May 1, 2025).  \n41.   On June 26, 2025, the District Court denied emergency relief solely on the ground \nthat plaintiffs had not demonstrated irreparable harm. PPGNY, 2025 WL 1768100, at *6, 9 (D.D.C. \nJune 26, 2025), Dkt. No. 27. The order did not address the likelihood of success on the merits. \n42.  On July 2, 2025, HHS granted Plaintiffs’ NCC applications. As a result, Plaintiffs \nno longer faced the potential that their applications would be denied and voluntarily dismissed \ntheir case on July 11, 2025.  \n \n10 OPA, Guidance for Preparing a Non-Competing Continuation (NCC) Award Application, Teen \nPregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program Recipients (AH-TP1-23-001), HHS (2025) (hereinafter the \n“NCC Notice”) (attached hereto as Ex. B).  \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 12 of 51\n43.  Notwithstanding their NCC applications being granted, the Plaintiffs are now \nsubject to the Program Mandate that HHS subsequently issued for the entire TPP program, which \nis discussed further below. \nHHS Issues the Program Mandate \n44.  HHS’s efforts to impose unlawful and harmful directives culminated with the \npublication of the Program Mandate, which imposes numerous harmful and unlawful requirements \non all TPP program participants that are subject to arbitrary enforcement.  \n45.  On July 2, 2025, HHS published an update to its website titled “HHS Issues Policy \nto Stop the Radical Indoctrination of Children and Ensure Parental Oversight for Teen Pregnancy \nPrevention Program Grants.”11 The update includes a link to a word document titled OASH Teen \nPregnancy Prevention Program Policy Notice (Program Mandate), attached hereto as Exhibit C. \nAlthough the Program Mandate is dated July 1, 2025, it was not posted publicly until July 2, 2025, \naround 9:00 AM EST.  \n46.  Notably, the Program Mandate was published on the same day that HHS granted \nthe Plaintiffs’ NCC applications. In other words, while HHS granted the Plaintiffs’ applications \nnotwithstanding  their  refusal  to  certify  compliance  with  the  Executive  Order  “alignment” \nrequirements in connection with their application materials, it then turned around and made their \nprojects subject to a host of unlawful requirements through a new mechanism and under a new \nmethod of enforcement. \n \n11 OASH, HHS, HHS Issues Policy to Stop the Radical Indoctrination of Children and Ensure \nParental Oversight for Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program Grants (HHS Issues Policy) (Jul. 29, \n2025), https://health.gov/news/hhs-issues-policy-stop-radical-indoctrination-children-and-ensure-\nparental-oversight-teen. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 13 of 51\n47.  The Program Mandate states that “TPP Program grant recipients are expected to \nensure all program materials comply” with its directives. Program Mandate, Ex. C at 5. The \nProgram Mandate threatens that TPP Program grantees “determined [to be] noncompliant with the \n[Program Mandate] may face grant suspension under 45 C.F.R. § 75.371 and grant termination \nunder 45 C.F.R. § 75.372(a) before October 1, 2025, and, starting October 1, 2025, termination \nunder 2 CFR §§ 200.340(a)(1)-(4).” Id. OASH also warns that it “may re-evaluate the effectiveness \nof programs consistent with the statutory text and [the Program Mandate]” and “may impose \nadditional conditions on grantees that fail to comply with any Federal statutes, regulations or terms \nand conditions that apply to their awards.”  Id. at 6 (citing 45 C.F.R. § 75.371). 45 C.F.R. § 75.371 \nsets forth a range of “remedies” for noncompliance ranging from “temporary withhold[ing]” of \nfunds, the initiation of “suspension . . . proceedings” or “enforcement actions” by the agency, or \n“other remedies that may be legally available.”  \n48.  While HHS characterizes its Program Mandate as a “policy notice” that merely \n“clarif[ies] OASH policy,” the Program Mandate in fact imposes new and substantive harmful \nconditions on continued funding.  \nExecutive Order “Alignment” Requirement \n49.  The Program Mandate codifies the NCC Notice’s requirement that TPP participants \n“align” their programs with “all current Presidential Executive Orders.” Program Mandate, Ex. C \nat 1 (emphasis added). The Program Mandate leaves the term “align” entirely undefined thereby \nfailing to impose constraints on how agency officials may evaluate alignment with the more than \n170 Executive Orders issued since January 20, 2025—and granting them unchecked discretion to \nenforce the requirement in an arbitrary or discriminatorily selective manner. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 14 of 51\n50.   Of the 170 Executive Orders issued since January 20, 2025, most (if not all) are \nentirely  irrelevant  to  teenage  pregnancy  prevention,  ranging  from  everything  from  national \nsecurity and immigration, to reorganization of federal agencies, to cultural‑renaming initiatives.12 \nMany of those Executive Orders contain vague, undefined, or underdefined terms. Many have \nbeen enjoined.13 \n51.  Notably, the Program Mandate does not require applicants to “comply” with the \nExecutive Orders—presumably because the Executive Orders themselves are not self-executing \nas to private entities (i.e., they direct agencies to take various actions) and, therefore, do not \nthemselves  create  any  new  obligations  for  funding  recipients.14  Instead,  Defendants  take  a \nsweeping and indecipherable approach by demanding “alignment.”  \n52.  While the Program Mandate requires TPP grantees to be aware of all Executive \nOrders, it highlights five specific Executive Orders that “may be of most relevance to the work of \nthe TPP program.” Program Mandate, Ex. C at 1. Those Executive Orders are: Defending Women \nFrom Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government (EO \n \n12 See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14161, 90 Fed. Reg. 8451 (Jan. 20, 2025) (entitled “Protecting the \nUnited States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats”); \nExec.  Order  No.  14222,  90  Fed.  Reg.  11095  (Feb.  26,  2025)  (entitled  “Implementing  the \nPresident’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative”); Exec. Order No. \n14172, 90 Fed. Reg. 8629 (Jan. 20, 2025) (entitled “Restoring Names that Honor American \nGreatness”). \n13 See, e.g., Chicago Women in Trades v. Trump, No. 25-cv-2005, 2025 WL 1118659, at *1 (N.D. \nIll. Apr. 15, 2025) (enjoining enforcement of EOs 14151 and 14173 insofar as they mandated \ntermination of equity-related grant or compliance certification by grantee); see also Litigation \nTracker:  Legal  Challenges  to  Trump  Administration  Actions,  Just Security  (July  22, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/8JKK-NJUG  (collecting  cases  in  which  injunctions  have  been  issued).  The \nProgram Mandate’s failure to distinguish those Executive Orders that remain in effect from others \ncompounds both the arbitrariness and vagueness of the “alignment” requirements. \n14 H. COMM. ON GOV’T OPERATIONS, 85th Cong., EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND PROCLAMATIONS: A \nSTUDY OF A USE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWERS 1 (Comm. Print 1957) (“Executive orders are generally \ndirected to, and govern actions by, Government officials and agencies. They usually affect private \nindividuals only indirectly.”). \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 15 of 51\n14168), Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling (EO 14190), Protecting Children From \nChemical and Surgical Mutilation (EO 14187), Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI \nPrograms and Preferencing (EO 14151), and Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-\nBased Opportunity (EO 14173). \n53.  A brief review of the five enumerated Executive Orders that grantees are now \nrequired to “align” with reveals that the “alignment” requirement is fundamentally at odds with \nthe statutory mandates and underlying public health goals of the Teen Pregnancy Prevention \nProgram, and also that the “alignment requirement” violates the Constitution and the APA. \n54.  Executive Order 14151. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder 14151, titled Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing. \n90 Fed. Reg. 8,339 (Jan. 29, 2025). Order 14151 directs the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget “to coordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI.” \nIt further directs all agency heads to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, DEI \noffices, programs, and positions, as well as ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts.” The Order does \nnot define “illegal DEI” or what it means for a grant to be “equity-related.” \n55.  Executive Order 14168. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder 14168, titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological \nTruth to the Federal Government. 90 Fed. Reg. 8,615 (Jan. 30, 2025). Order 14168 states that “[i]t \nis the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female,” which “are not \nchangeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.” It then defines “female” \nand “male” based on whether an individual belongs, “at conception, to the sex that produces the \nlarge reproductive cell” or “the small reproductive cell.” It further defines “gender ideology” as \n“replac[ing] the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 16 of 51\nidentity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice \nversa,” which “includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from \none’s sex.” In its operative provisions, Order 14168 directs agencies to adopt the definitions set \nforth in the Order and to “take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding \nof gender ideology.” It further directs agencies to “assess grant conditions and grant preferences \nand ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.” \n56.  Order 14168 also instructs the Secretary of HHS to “provide guidance expanding \non the sex-based definitions set forth in th[e] order.” On February 19, 2025, HHS adopted guidance \npursuant to the Order, largely repeating its language and adopting the Order’s definitions. The \nguidance provides that “[a] person’s sex is unchangeable and determined by objective biology” \nand that “[r]ecognizing the immutable and biological nature of sex is essential to ensure the \nprotection of women’s health, safety, private spaces, sports, and opportunities.” Guidance for \nFederal  Agencies,  External  Partners,  and  the  Public  Implementing  Executive  Order  14168, \nDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the \nFederal Government (Feb. 19, 2025), http://bit.ly/44eLQmz. According to the guidance, “[s]ex is \na person’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.” “Female is a person of \nthe sex characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing eggs \n(ova).” “Male is a person of the sex characterized by a reproductive system with the biological \nfunction of producing sperm.” “Woman is an adult human female.” “Girl is a minor human \nfemale.” “Man is an adult human male.” “Boy is a minor human male.” “Mother is a female \nparent.” “Father is a male parent.” Id.   \n57.  Executive Order 14173. On January 21, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder 14173, titled Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity. 90 \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 17 of 51\nFed. Reg. 8,633 (Jan. 31, 2025). Order 14173 directs that “[t]he head of each agency shall include \nin every contract or grant award … [a] term requiring that the contractual counterparty or grant \nrecipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination \nlaws is material to the government’s payment decisions” and “[a] term requiring such counterparty \nor recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any \napplicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.” The government has publicly taken the position that \nmerely “tout[ing] [one’s] commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion” may, in its view, warrant \ninvestigation for unlawful discrimination.15  \n58.  Executive Order 14187. On January 28, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder 14187, titled Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation which directs \nagency heads to “immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal \nresearch or education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.” 90 Fed. Reg. \n8,771 (Feb. 3, 2025).  \n59.  Executive Order 14190. On January 29, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder 14190, titled Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling. 90 Fed. Reg. 8,853 (Feb. 3, \n2025). Order 14190 directs agencies to develop recommendations to “eliminat[e] Federal funding \nor support for illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including \nbased  on  gender  ideology  and  discriminatory  equity  ideology.”  It  further  directs  that  such \nrecommendations shall contain and analyze “[a]ll Federal funding sources and streams, including \ngrants or contracts, that directly or indirectly support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or \npromotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology” and shall outline a “process to \n \n15  See  Equal  Emp.

None of the Executive Orders highlighted in the Program Mandate as “most \nrelevan[t]” to the TPP program mention teen pregnancy or sexual education. Nor do they identify \nwhat characteristics an evidence-based program to prevent teen pregnancy must have to “align” \nwith the order. \nNew Content Mandates   \n61.  In addition to the Executive Order “alignment” requirement, the Program Mandate \nsets forth sweeping content-based restrictions. At best, the requirements set forth in the Program \nMandate are impossibly vague; at worst, they conflict with statutory requirements and run afoul \nof well-established scientific consensus.  \n62.  As detailed below, the Program Mandate imposes five content mandates: (1) an \nanti-DEI mandate; (2) a prohibition of certain LGBTQ+ content; (3) an anti-“normalizing” sex \nmandate; (4) the redefining of what qualifies as “medically accurate” information; and (5) the \nimposition of an opt-out requirement. \n63.  The Program Mandate’s prohibition may cover an untold number of undefined \n“ideologies.” Aside from three ideologies mentioned in the Program Mandate: (1) “content at issue \nin Mahmoud,” (2) “gender ideology,” and (3) “discriminatory equity ideology,” Program Mandate, \nEx. C at 4, it is entirely unclear what criteria the agency will use in assessing which “ideologies” \nare not acceptable or how ideologies are to be excluded from TPP programs and materials. That \nis, while the Program Mandate identifies certain “ideologies,” it wholly fails to define them. At \nleast as commonly used, the term “ideology” means “a systematic body of concepts especially \nabout  human  life  or  culture.”  Ideology,  Merriam-Webster,  https://www.merriam-\n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 19 of 51\nwebster.com/dictionary/ideology (last visited July 29, 2025). The Program Mandate does not \ndirect that teenagers must be educated absent any ideology (assuming that is even possible), only \nthat the programs must not include ideology that Administration views as “harmful.” The use of \n“ideology” as a benchmark for funding is thus particularly prime for arbitrary enforcement and—\ncritically—viewpoint discrimination. \nAnti-DEI Mandate  \n64.  The Program Mandate imposes what can be described as an anti-DEI mandate—a \nvague  set  of  requirements  prohibiting  programming  from  including  “discriminatory  equity \nideology,” and “diversity, equity, or inclusion-related discrimination.” Program Mandate, Ex. C at \n4-5. The Program Mandate also broadly forbids programs from promoting ideologies that the \nadministration deems “harmful,” though it fails to define what those ideologies are. Id. at 4. \n65.  The Program Mandate expressly prohibits TPP programs from “teaching minors” \nabout  “discriminatory  equity  ideology,”  as  “defined  in  Executive  Order  14190.”  Program \nMandate, Ex. C at 2; see also HHS Issues Policy, supra n.2 (“Program materials . . . may not \npromote anti-American ideologies such as discriminatory equity ideology.”). \n66.  Executive Order 14190 defines “discriminatory equity ideology” as follows: \nan ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, \nrather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of \nimmoral generalizations, including that: \n(i) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently \nsuperior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; \n(ii) An individual, by virtue of the individual's race, color, sex, or national origin, \nis inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; \n(iii)  An  individual’s  moral  character  or  status  as  privileged,  oppressing,  or \noppressed is primarily determined by the individual's race, color, sex, or national \norigin; \n(iv) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not \nattempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin; \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 20 of 51\n(v) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, \nbears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological \ndistress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or \nshould receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other \nmembers of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual \nplayed no part; \n(vi) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, \nshould be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, \nequity, or inclusion; \n(vii) Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, \nand racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a \nparticular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, \ncolor, sex, or national origin; or \n(viii)  the  United  States  is  fundamentally  racist,  sexist,  or  otherwise \ndiscriminatory.16 \n67.  The Program Mandate also states that “OASH is concerned” about the definitions \nof several terms OASH has adopted in prior NOFOs.17 The Program Mandate does not identify \nwhat exactly in those definitions is “concern[ing].” Instead, the Program Mandate states that the \nterms “health equity,” “equitable environment,” “inclusivity,” and “adolescent-friendly services” \n“should  not  be  construed  to  .  .  .  permit  unlawful  diversity,  equity,  or  inclusion-related \ndiscrimination.” The Program Mandate does not explain the basis for its concerns, nor how or why \nthese terms would be construed unlawfully, nor does it offer alternative definitions for “health \nequity,” “equitable environment,” “inclusivity,” or “adolescent-friendly services.”  \n68.  The  Program  Mandate  does  not  define  “diversity,  equity,  or  inclusion”  or \n“diversity, equity, or inclusion-related discrimination.” Nor do any of the referenced Executive \nOrders. See generally Exec. Order No. 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025); see also Am. \nPub. Health Assoc. v. Nat’l Inst. of Health, 2025 WL 1822487, at *5 (D. Mass. July 2, 2025) (“The \n \n16 Exec.

Reg. 8853 (Jan. 29, 2025). \n17 Those terms are “adolescent-friendly services,” “age appropriateness,” “equitable environment,” \n“health equity,” “inclusivity,” and “medical accuracy.” Program Mandate, Ex.

No one has ever \ndefined it to this Court—and this Court has asked multiple times.”). \n69.  The Program Mandate imposes prohibitions on “discriminatory equity ideology” \nand  “diversity,  equity,  or  inclusion-related  discrimination”  without  articulating  any  limiting \nprinciples, thereby granting agency officials broad discretion to determine—based on subjective \nor discriminatory judgments—when a program has violated these vague standards, enabling \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.. \n70.  Public  reporting  reflects  that  the  government  has  deemed  grant-funded \nprogramming to amount to prohibited DEI for “including words like ‘trauma,’ barriers,’ ‘equity,’ \nand ‘excluded.’”18 \n71.  “The phrase ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ commonly denotes ‘a set of values \nand related policies and practices focused on establishing a group culture of equitable and inclusive \ntreatment and on attracting and retaining a diverse group of participants, including people who \nhave historically been excluded or discriminated against.’” Nat’l Educ.

Vague regulatory language like “DEI” and “discriminatory equity ideology” can \nlead to arbitrary or even discriminatory enforcement thereby bestowing upon the agency unfettered \ndiscretion to decide how to weaponize the term.

Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 182 (2018) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (“Vague laws also threaten to transfer legislative power to police and \nprosecutors,  leaving  to  them  the  job  of  shaping  a  vague  statute’s  contours  through  their \nenforcement decisions.”); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972) (“A vague \nlaw impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution \non an ad hoc and subjective basis.”). \n73.  It is “no surprise” that federal courts across the country have struck down similar \nDEI prohibitions as unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary and capricious. Nat’l Educ. Ass’n, 2025 \nWL 1188160, at *19; see also, e.g., Santa Cruz Lesbian & Gay Cmty. Ctr. v. Trump, 508 F. Supp. \n3d 521, 529, 543-45 (N.D.

July 2, 2025) (“Without a definition of DEI, [the agency] embarked on \na fool’s errand resulting in arbitrary and capricious action.”). \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 23 of 51\nProhibition of LGBTQ+ Content  \n74.  The Program Mandate also prohibits the inclusion of various  LGBTQ+-inclusive \ncontent  in  TPP  programming  through  a  combination  of  harmful  and  sweeping  restrictions, \nincluding explicitly banning so-called “gender ideology” and referencing the “content at issue in \nMahmoud,”  which  were  materials  depicting  same-sex  marriage  and  LGBTQ+  identities. \nCollectively, these requirements could effectively be enforced to mandate the exclusion of any \naffirming or inclusive content related to gender identity or sexual orientation. \n75.  The Program Mandate does not define “gender ideology.” Instead, the Program \nMandate refers to “gender ideology” “as such terms are defined in Executive Order 14190.” \nProgram Mandate, Ex. C at 2. Executive Order 14190 does not define “gender ideology,” but does \nadopt the definitions of Executive Order 14168, which states the following: \n“Gender ideology” replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of \nself-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus \nbecome women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false \nclaim as true.  Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders \nthat are disconnected from one’s sex.  Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it \ndiminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is \npossible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. \n“Gender identity” reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from \nbiological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a \nmeaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. \n76.  The  Program  Mandate’s  prohibition  on  “gender  ideology”  can  be  arbitrarily \nenforced to disallow lesson plans or language that are inclusive of and respect the existence of \ntransgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary program participants. Such a prohibition can \nbe enforced to preclude discussions about gender roles and expectations, which are essential to \nhelping  young  people  learn  about  the  way  that  people  may  behave  in  relationships  and \ncorresponding skills that are important in TPP programs such as how to communicate, negotiate, \nand refuse unprotected sexual activity.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 24 of 51\n77.  Moreover, a review of studies on teen pregnancy prevention programs shows that \nprograms  that  address  issues  of  gender  are  more  likely  to  result  in  reductions  of  sexually \ntransmitted diseases and teen pregnancy. Examining how gender roles and expectations may \ninfluence how adolescents engage in relationships is an important component of pregnancy \nprevention.  Gender  norms  and  expectations  can  influence  sexual  risk-taking  behavior.  For \nexample, gender norms can influence the perception of which person is responsible for preventing \nteen pregnancy when in fact both people are responsible. HHS did not provide any justification for \nits change of position on why, contrary to previous research on effective teen pregnancy prevention \nprograms, “gender ideology” is outside the scope of the TPP Program. \n78.  Additionally, the Program Mandate’s requirement that TPP programs maintain the \n“biological reality of sex” as including only “males and females” contravenes the statutory \nrequirement that TPP programs be “medically accurate.”  HHS’s assertion that “information” is \nnot “medically accurate” if it “denies the biological reality of sex or otherwise fails to distinguish \nappropriately between males and females,” Program Mandate, Ex. C at 5, runs directly contrary to \nwidely available scientific evidence, see, e.g., Tiffany Jones, Intersex Studies: A Systematic Review \nof International Health Literature, 8 SAGE OPEN 2 (April 2018) (“Research has generally \nestimated that 1.7% to 4% of people go on to actually have intersex variations.”); Claire Ainsworth, \nSex Redefined, 518 NATURE 288, 288-90 (February 19, 2015) (“[D]octors have long known that \nsome people straddle the boundary—their sex chromosomes say one thing, but their gonads \n(ovaries or testes) or sexual anatomy say another.”). The agency’s decision to redefine sex—and \nin doing so erase the existence of individuals with intersex characteristics—therefore cannot be \nsustained because it “rests upon a factual premise that is unsupported by substantial evidence.” \nGenuine Parts Co. v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 890 F.3d 304, 346 (D.C. Cir. 2018). \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 25 of 51\n79.  The  Program  Mandate  also  identifies  the  “content  at  issue  in  Mahmoud”  as \n“ideological content” to be excluded from TPP Programming and argues that the Mahmoud \ndecision “confirms that the best reading of the TPP statute does not contemplate such ideological \ncontent.” Program Mandate, Ex. C at 3. The Program Mandate identifies the “content at issue” in \nMahmoud as “LGBTQ+-inclusive” books and content that “portrayed messages and images about \nsame-sex marriage and gender ideology.” Id. at 2. The Program Mandate thus bans any material \nthat the agency may determine falls within these categories from program material.  \n80.  The  Program  Mandate  places  no  limits  on  how  the  agency  can  enforce  the \nrequirement that TPP grantees exclude certain LGBTQ+ content from their programs. Nor does it \naddress that several Tier 1 projects are required to reach underserved communities with the highest \nunmet needs, including LGBTQ+ youth, as a part of their contractual agreements with HHS.  For \nexample, in the 2023 Tier 1 NOFO, HHS, citing public health data, identified the need for teen \npregnancy prevention projects that addressed the existing health disparities between LGBTQ+ \nyouth and their heterosexual and cisgender peers, with LGBTQ+ youth experiencing higher rates \nof unintended teen pregnancy and STIs than their counterparts. 2023 NOFO, Ex. A at 5, 7.  \n81.  Requiring Tier 1 recipients to change their curriculum around these ideological \nrequirements is also incompatible with the statutory mandate that TPP Program funding recipients \nreplicate the evidence-based programs already approved by the agency. \nAnti-Normalizing Sex Mandate   \n82.  The Program Mandate also prohibits “content that encourages, normalizes, or \npromotes sexual activity for minors.” Asserting, in a conclusory fashion, that such content is \n“outside the scope of the TPP,” the Program Mandate does not define the terms “encourages,” \n“normalizes,” or “promotes.” And this problem is compounded by the fact that any discussion of \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 26 of 51\nteen pregnancy prevention necessarily requires discussion, and acknowledgment, of sexual activity \nas an essential element of the curriculum to ensure that the program is effective. The Program \nMandate provides no standards that the agency will use in  determining what materials or \ninstructions constitute “encouraging,” “normalizing,” or “promoting” sexual activity for minors, \nthereby granting agency officials broad discretion to enforce the provision based on subjective \ninterpretations—enabling  arbitrary  and  discriminatory  enforcement  in  violation  of  the  Fifth \nAmendment. \n83.  A prohibition on “normaliz[ing]” sex within TPP programs could, in effect, be \nenforced as a requirement that programs adopt abstinence-only curriculum, even if not explicitly \nlabeled  as  such.  Generally,  effective  sexual  education  programs  teach  about  contraception, \nconsent, healthy relationships, and strategies for reducing “other risk factors” associated with teen \npregnancy that acknowledge the reality that some adolescents are or will become sexually active. \nIf such instruction is deemed to “normalize” sex and is therefore restricted, educators may be \nlimited to promoting abstinence as the only acceptable behavior to prevent teen pregnancy. But \neven abstinence-only programs could be construed as “normalizing” sex as activities in those \nprograms—such as role plays to help young people learn to refuse sex—could be viewed as \nnormalizing the idea that sex could occur among teenagers. \n84.  Abstinence-only-until-marriage programs have been shown to be ineffective in \nchanging adolescent sexual behavior. Thus, by framing medically accurate, developmentally \nappropriate, and evidence-based information and programs about safe sex as impermissible \n“normalization,” the anti-normalizing sex mandate would effectively suppress critical health \neducation and undermines the statutory goals of the TPP program aimed at reducing unintended \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 27 of 51\nteenage pregnancy, behavioral risk factors underlying teenage pregnancy, and other associated risk \nfactors. \n85.  The Program Mandate also excludes from the scope of the program content “that is \nnot related to, or counter to the aim of reducing teen pregnancy,” listing “anal and oral sex.” These \ntopics are vital to the TPP Program’s goal of reducing rates of STIs and are an important \ncomponent of effective sexual education. Mandating exclusion of such content disregards rising \nrates of STIs among young people and the importance of addressing topics related to behaviors \nthat pose a risk of STI transmission among program participants. See also, e.g., Cora C. Breuner, \nMD, MPH et al., Sexuality Education for Children and Adolescents, 138 Am. Acad. Pediatricts 2, \ne2 (2016) (“All children and adolescents need to receive accurate education about sexuality to \nunderstand ultimately how to practice healthy sexual behavior.”).  \nRedefining “Medically Accurate”   \n86.  The Program Mandate also abandons the agency’s prior, evidence-based standard \nfor determining whether content is “medically accurate” in favor of a vague and ideologically \ndriven formulation.  \n87.  Under prior NOFOs, OSHA defined medical accuracy as follows: \nMedical  accuracy  -  Verified  or  supported  by  the  weight  of  research \nconducted in compliance with accepted scientific methods; and published \nin peer-reviewed journals, where applicable or comprising information that \nleading professional organizations and agencies with relevant expertise in \nthe field recognize as accurate, objective, and complete.19 \n88.  This definition is not only consistent with a well-established and longstanding \nmeaning of medical accuracy within public health and evidence-based policy, but is also identical \n \n19 Program Mandate, Ex. C at 5. \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 28 of 51\nto the definition of “medically accurate and complete” in 42 U.S.C. § 713(e)(2), as a part of the \nPersonal Responsibility Education Program.  \n89.  The  Program  Mandate  indicates  that  “OASH  is  concerned”  about  the  prior \ndefinition, but does not identify the cause of these concerns, and what weight, if any, this prior \ndefinition still holds. Instead, the Program Mandate instructs as follows: \n“Medically  accurate”  materials  or  instructions  with  pharmaceutical  or  health-\nrelated recommendations are expected to include information on a full range of \nhealth risks, so that minors and their parents or guardians can make fully informed \ndecisions.  Content  that  is  not  “medically  accurate”  may  include  inaccurate \ninformation about methods of contraception, including associated health risks, or \ninformation that denies the biological reality of sex or otherwise fails to distinguish \nappropriately between males and females, such as for the purpose of body literacy. \nProgram Mandate, Ex. C. at 4-5.   \n90.  The Program Mandate insists that “OASH will determine whether program content \nis ‘medically accurate’ consistent with the statutory language,” Program Mandate, Ex. C at 5, but \nthen provides no explanation of what is wrong with the prior definition or any justification for why \nthe agency is changing its position on how to define “medically accurate.” \n91.  Moreover, the Program Mandate does not merely “clarify” what it considers to be \nmedically accurate, but also imposes a novel obligation that TPP programs instruct participants on \nthe “full range of health risks” associated with contraceptives. \n92.  TPP programs are not clinical settings, and it is neither practical nor appropriate \nwithin  the  context  of  a  TPP  program  to  require  facilitators—who  may  not  be  medical \nprofessionals—to provide individualized medical guidance about contraception. Moreover, the \nmandate to present a “full range of health risks” is harmful and unworkable, and raises serious \nquestions about whether, for instance, every mention of contraception must be accompanied by an \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 29 of 51\nexhaustive, disclaimer-style disclosure beyond that which is required in TV ads for prescription \ndrugs.20  \n93.  OASH cannot impose new affirmative obligations on TPP programs under the \nguise of “clarifying” a statutory term. See Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 385 \n(2024) (“The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to exercise their independent judgment \nin deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority[.]”). \nOpt-Out Requirement  \n94.  The Program Mandate, invoking the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Mahmoud v. \nTaylor, 606 U.S. ___ (2025), imposes yet another new requirement on TPP programs: to “provide \nparents advance notice (including relevant specifics) and the ability to opt out of any content or \nactivities, especially those related to sexuality, that may burden their religious exercise.” Program \nMandate, Ex. C at 3. \n95.  The  Program  Mandate’s  opt-out  requirement  delegates  sweeping  enforcement \ndiscretion to agency officials by failing to specify how the agency will assess the propriety of an \nopt-out advance notice provided or what content is subject to it. By requiring grantees to allow \nparents to opt out of content that “may burden” their religious exercise—without defining the \nscope of that burden or the types of content implicated—the Mandate enables enforcement based \non subjective and potentially discriminatory assessments. This standardless framework permits \nofficials to selectively enforce the opt-out requirement depending on viewpoint, creating a serious \n \n20 Compare Program Mandate, Ex. C at 5 (requiring that “methods about contraception” must be \naccompanied by “information on a full range of health risks”) (emphasis added), with FDA, \nPrescription Drug Advertising - Questions and Answers, (Jun. 19, 2015) (requiring only disclosure \nof “the drug’s most important risks”) (emphasis added), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/prescription-\ndrug-advertising/prescription-drug-advertising-questions-and-answers#non_requirements.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 30 of 51\nrisk of arbitrary and discriminatory application. As such, the opt-out provision is unconstitutionally \nvague under the Fifth Amendment.  \nThreat of Non-Compliance \n96.  TPP funds are made available via Payment Management Services (PMS), a service \nprovider that processes grant payments for the federal government. Through the process of \naccessing funds already awarded to them via an electronic reimbursement process–i.e., “drawing \ndown” the awarded funds–TPP funding recipients certify that they will comply with program \npolicies, including the Program Mandate.  \n97.  However,  if  an  agency  determines  that  a  recipient  of  TPP  funds  has  been \nnoncompliant, it may pursue a series of remedies including suspension and termination of funding. \nIn certain circumstances, HHS regulations allow for recoupment of funds that the agency deems \nwrongfully issued through the “clawback” of funds previously issued to reimburse grantees for \nexpenses and costs associated with the program. \nHARMS SUFFERED BY PLAINTIFFS \n98.  Plaintiffs  are  nonprofit  organizations  dedicated  to  providing  comprehensive, \nmedically accurate, developmentally appropriate, and inclusive sexual education programming. In \nresponse to the TPP Tier 1 FY 2023 NOFO, Plaintiffs devised and operationalized five-year \nprojects implementing evidence-based curricula that were designed—and approved—to provide \nservices to communities with the highest unmet needs. The continued existence of these projects \nis threatened by the Program Mandate.  \n99.  Presently, Plaintiffs’ TPP Projects have been approved for Year 3 funding for the \nbudget year of July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026. Each of these TPP Projects’ contents and \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 31 of 51\nmaterials have been approved by the agency directly or through the TPPER process before the \naward of TPP funding. \n100.  In order to access funds awarded to them, the Plaintiffs must certify compliance \nwith the Program Mandate. However, if Plaintiffs draws down funds subject to the Program \nMandate, HHS may arbitrarily and abruptly decide that Plaintiffs’ TPP Projects violate aspects of \nthe Program Mandate and subject Plaintiffs to “noncompliance” proceedings, including requiring \nPlaintiffs to repay funds provided to reimburse costs and expenses incurred to carry out TPP \nPrograms  using  materials  and  content  that  the  agency  had  previously  approved.  That  is, \nPlaintiffs—nonprofits that operate on tight budgets—face the prospect of being required to pay \nback funds already spent on agency-approved programming. \n101.  Drawing down the TPP funds that have been awarded to Plaintiffs is critical for \ntheir ability to continue their TPP programs. But because the Program Mandate forces funding \nrecipients to agree to various new requirements, the need to draw down funds and the resulting \nthreat of noncompliance creates an impossible situation, either: (1) agree to comply with the \nProgram  Mandate’s  harmful  requirements  under  the  threat  of  arbitrary  enforcement;  or  (2) \nrelinquish TPP funds and end their respective programs.  Plaintiffs fear the chilling effect that the \nProgram Mandate will have on their ability to carry out their TPP programs in accordance with \ntheir missions, values, and the underlying purpose of the TPP Program   \n102.  For  example,  Plaintiffs  fear  that  approved,  evidence-based  programs  that \nacknowledge that young people may consider being sexually active and discuss the importance of \nusing contraception to prevent unintended teen pregnancy or STIs may lead to accusations that \nthey are  in violation of the prohibition against “normalizing” sexual activity for minors. Or simply \nacknowledging disproportionate rates of unintended teen pregnancy and/or STI rates within certain \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 32 of 51\npopulations and communities in an effort to explain the purpose of the program could be deemed \nby agency officials as violating the Program Mandate’s anti-“normalizing” sex mandate.  \n103.  As  another  example,  Plaintiffs  implement  HHS-approved,  evidence-based \ncurricula that include activities during which program participants practice declining to engage in \nunsafe sexual behavior in different scenarios. Given the undefined nature of Program Mandate’s \nmany terms, some Plaintiffs fear that HHS would allege such activities violate the Program \nMandate’s prohibition against “role play.”  \n104.  Because Plaintiffs are required to replicate the curricula approved by the agency, \nthey are unable to simply discard chapters or substance from these materials without violating the \nTPP statutory requirement. \n105.  Plaintiffs, at the direction of HHS, committed significant resources, time, and \ncapacity-building efforts to design and implement projects that are focused on communities and \npopulations with the greatest needs and facing significant health disparities within their respective \ncommunities. In response to the 2023 NOFO, Plaintiffs carefully developed their projects based \non public health data identifying rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs among adolescents that \nrecognized the unique needs of many communities. \n106.  Choosing to relinquish TPP funds places the future of Plaintiffs’ TPP Projects and \ntheir programming in peril. \n107.  PPGNY: PPGNY provides evidence-based programming that is, by design and in \nresponse to the 2023 NOFO, intended to provide high-quality, fact-based sexual education to \ncommunities that PPGNY has identified as facing significant disparities in rates of unintended teen \npregnancy and STIs. Consequently, PPGNY’s TPP programming—entitled Project STAR—\naddresses the unique needs of youth who identify as LGBTQ+, immigrant and/or English language \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 33 of 51\nlearners, and youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities. PPGNY’s programming is \ntaught in a variety of settings, including schools, community based organizations, and residential \nsettings. Through implementation of various HHS-approved, evidence-based programs, PPGNY’s \nprogramming  involves  a  curriculum  that  covers  a  wide  array  of  topics  ranging  from  HIV \nprevention to educating parents on how to normalize conversations with their children about \nsexuality. Likewise, PPGNY’s educators are trained on how to answer student questions in an \naccurate, developmentally appropriate, and non-judgmental manner and ensure that lessons are \ninclusive to the experiences and identities of all participants. \n108.  Under the Program Mandate, PPGNY would have to substantially modify its \nprograms to mitigate accusations of noncompliance in a manner that is inconsistent with the \norganization’s values and mission and would dilute the quality of sexual education programming \nthat it offers and go against TPP requirements that EBPs be implemented with fidelity.  \n109.  The Program Mandate would have a chilling effect on PPGNY’s program staff, \nwho would be forced to censor discussions related to and cease all programming that they fear \ncould be considered by the agency to “promote gender ideology” or LGBTQ+ inclusion, or remove \nkey content related to inclusivity, equity, trauma-informed practices, or youth identities, which \nwould defeat the purpose of Project STAR. All of these changes would damage PPGNY’s \nreputation in the community as a source of medically accurate and evidence-based information \nand services. It would also damage the goodwill that PPGNY has built with its community \npartners. For these reasons and absent relief, PPGNY will not draw down funds while the Program \nMandate is enforceable against it.  \n110.  Relinquishing TPP funds places future of Project STAR in peril. Without access to \nTPP funds, PPGNY will be limited in the sexual education programming that it can continue to \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 34 of 51\noffer. The loss of TPP funds will result in the loss of irreplaceable funds and require termination \nof programming, layoffs of highly trained PPGNY staff, and the end of partnerships that PPGNY \nhas established with communities that are often overlooked and underserved.  \n111.  Because of its limited financial resources as a nonprofit and obligations to third \nparties in relation to its ability to provide expected programming, PPGNY must decide this week \nas to the future of its program.  \n112.  PPCCC: PPCCC’s TPP Program, CSEC, is a teen pregnancy prevention initiative \nthat  aims  to  improve  sexual  health  outcomes;  promote  positive  youth  development  and \nempowerment; and advance health equity and inclusivity for adolescents, their families and \ncommunities through replication of medically accurate and age-appropriate evidence-based teen \npregnancy prevention programs. CSEC engages in public education activities that work with \nbilingual community health educators to deliver sexual education and information to adults, teens, \nand families.  \n113.  Because  of  the  Program  Mandate,  PPCCC  is  forced  to  choose  between  (1) \ncontinuing the program as approved under the threat of investigation and claw back of funding; \n(2) being forced to make further changes that render the program less effective and run contrary \nto PPCCC’s mission and even then still risk being deemed non-compliant with a vague directive \nin the Program Mandate; or (3) foregoing the third year of funding, which already has been \nawarded, shutting down the project and laying off program staff. \n114.  PPCCC has to make a decision imminently because PPCCC cannot operate the \nprogram, pay staff, and incur program related costs without a guarantee that those costs will be \nreimbursed. Moreover, PPCCC’s education department’s future has been placed in jeopardy as it \nis unable to make pressing decisions, including related to renewing contracts and properly \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 35 of 51\ninforming staff as to the potential termination of their roles. Every passing day adds further expense \nand risk.   \n115.  PPCCC fears it may be subject to arbitrary accusations of noncompliance if it \nchooses to stay in the program. For example, while non of the educational materials that PPCCC \nuses depict sexual activity or anatomy in an erotic or explicit manner, PPCCC fears that its HHS \napproved evidence-based programming could be accused of “promoting” or “normalizing” sexual \nactivity. The Program Mandate’s changes to the definitions of “age appropriate” and “medical \naccuracy” and the scope of the program have a chilling effect on the content that PPCCC’s \neducators can provide and restrict their ability to be transparent about the risks of sexual behavior \nand the safety measures needed to help prevent teen pregnancies and STIs, as they have done for \nthe last few years under their grant. In addition, PPCCC is concerned that the agency could \ndetermine that the Program Mandate required PPCCC’s educators to make inappropriate and \ninaccurate disclosures about contraception and potentially restricts educators from answering \nquestions in a straight-forward and honest way.   \n116.  PPCCC’s continued participation in the program would put it at risk of arbitrary \nand discriminatory investigation and enforcement. Additionally, if an investigation resulted in the \nclaw-back of funds that were already spent in reliance on the expectation of reimbursement under \nthe TPP grant, this could jeopardize PPCCC’s financial viability.  \n117.  The Program Mandate also threatens irreparable harm to PPCCC’s reputation \namong contracting partners and the communities it serves.  For some of those communities, \nremoving  content  and  material  that  acknowledges  their  community’s  unique  needs  will  be \nperceived as betraying a commitment to provide effective and inclusive sex education. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 36 of 51\n118.  Finally, PPCCC is concerned that under the Program Mandate, it may be required \nto make further changes to its approved, evidence-based programming that would likely defeat the \nvery purpose of PPCCC’s program: to ensure that sexual education and information is delivered \nto adults, teens, and families experiencing the highest unmet needs in the area in a manner that is \neffective,  medically  accurate, and appropriate to  their  individualized circumstances.  Further \nprogramming changes would also entail additional unrecoverable costs, including staff time \nnecessary to review and modify program materials. \n119.  If, on the other hand, PPCCC leaves the TPP Program, it will no longer be able to \ncontinue to run CSEC. This absence will harm the communities that have come to rely on CSEC \nprogramming. Further, PPCCC will be forced to lay off CSEC staff and find alternative funding \nfor staff who were partially supported by TPP funding. This will reduce PPCCC’s capacity and \nability to serve its mission. Having to terminate the program early will also irreparably damage \nPPCCC’s relationships with community partners and its reputation in the community.  \n120.  Because PPCCC must submit its revised workplan to HHS on August 15, 2025, and \nin doing so certify compliance with the Program Mandate, relief is urgently needed before that \ndate.  PPCCC cannot operate its programs and incur programming expenses under the HHS’s \nthreat of compliance proceedings and potential claw-backs, and thus will be forced to withdraw \nfrom the TPP Program absent judicial relief.   \n121.  PPH:  PPH’s  TPP  Project  offers  sexual  education  programming  designed,  in \nresponse to the 2023 NOFO, to meet the needs of communities in Iowa and Nebraska counties, \nincluding the Ponca and Winnebago Tribes of Nebraska, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color \n(BIPOC), and LGBTQIA2S+ communities.  \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 37 of 51\n122.  Because of the Program Mandate, PPH is forced to decide between (1) continuing \nthe program as approved and risking an arbitrary investigation or enforcement of the Program \nMandate; (2) incorporating further changes that render the program less effective and even then \nstill risk being deemed non-compliant with a vague directive in the Program Mandate; (3) or \nleaving the program and shutting down the project.  \n123.  PPH is committed to providing comprehensive and inclusive sexual education that \nmeets young people where they are, and relies on programming proven to be effective by research. \nWhile PPH’s use of specific EBPs has been approved, PPH fears arbitrary enforcement of many \nof  the  terms  of  the  Program  Mandate,  notwithstanding  the  approval.  PPH  fears  that  in \nimplementing the EBPs and materials approved by the HHS, they will be accused of violating the \nProgram Mandate. PPH also fears that HHS may accuse it of violating aspects of the Program \nMandate such as the “anti-normalization” mandate in circumstances where educators are willing \nto answer young people’s questions about sex and pregnancy prevention in a developmentally \nappropriate and medically accurate manner, especially in live presentation and question/answer \nenvironments that are a central feature of the program.   \n124.  Additionally, the Program Mandate’s anti-DEI mandate and prohibition on some \nLGBTQ+ content goes against PPH’s TPP project goals, designed in response to the 2023 NOFO, \nwhich are to increase the community’s capacity to engage with BIPOC and LGBTQIA2S+ youth \naround their sexual health in an effort to decrease teen pregnancy and STI rates across Nebraska \nand Iowa. These project goals are undermined by the requirements of the Program Mandate, \nincluding the restrictions on inclusion of lawful diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) language, \nreferences to gender identity, disability, and related components. \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 38 of 51\n125.  Alternatively, if PPH were to relinquish its TPP funding, the results would be \ndevastating. PPH’s infrastructure depends on PPH’s ability to obtain TPP funds. PPH would be \nforced to lay off staff and would have to cease its TPP programming, meaning that it would not be \nable to support subgrantees and other partners. This would have a negative impact on communities \nwhere PPH is a trusted partner and at times, the primary provider of sexual health information and \nresources, and cause PPH to suffer reputational harm.   \n126.  Given the options currently before PPH, and the irreparable impacts that would \nresult without its TPP funds, PPH anticipates drawing down funds in order to stave off those \nalternate  harms.  PPH  must  make  this  decision  imminently  because  it  has  limited  financial \nresources readily accessible to operate such programs. But once PPH draws down its funding, it \nmust accept the Project Mandate’s terms and conditions and will thereby be subject to the risk of \nother harms stemming from arbitrary accusations of noncompliance.  \n127.  As set forth above, HHS’s actions undermine public health initiatives crucial to \nteen pregnancy prevention, threatening decades of progress in evidence-based public policy and \nplace  at  risk  the  ability  of  underserved  communities  to  access  important  public  health \nprogramming. \n128.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT – \nTHE PROGRAM MANDATE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE  \nFIFTH AMENDMENT’S DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n129.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n130.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). The APA \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 39 of 51\nalso allows the reviewing court to “issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the \neffective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review \nproceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n131.  The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that no person \nshall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. U.S. CONST. amend V. A \nfundamental aspect of due process is that government-imposed obligations must be stated with \nsufficient  clarity  to  provide  fair  notice  and  prevent  arbitrary  enforcement.  A  law  is \nunconstitutionally vague if it invites arbitrary enforcement. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. \n104 (1972). In FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239 (2012), the Court emphasized \nthat regulations must provide clear guidance to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \n132.  Termination or suspension of Plaintiffs’ ongoing funding implicates Plaintiffs’ \nprotected liberty and property interests.  \n133.  The Program Mandate threatens to terminate and suspend TPP Program grantees’ \nfunding if grantees fail to (1) “align” their programs with Executive Orders and (2) comply with a \nseries of content mandates. These requirements are unconstitutionally vague because they are not \nstated with sufficient clarity to “define what conduct is sanctionable and what is not,” inviting \narbitrary enforcement. Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 156 (2018). \n134.  The Program Mandate requires grantees to “revise their projects to align with \nExecutive Orders that are currently in force as necessary in order to receive continuation funding.” \nProgram Mandate, Ex. C at 1. While TPP grantees are expected to “review and be aware of all \ncurrent Presidential Executive Orders,” the Program Mandate identifies five “of most relevance to \nthe work of the TPP program.” Id. at 1-2 (emphasis added). \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 40 of 51\n135.  Of the over 170 Executive Orders issued since January 20, 2025, most (if not all) \nare entirely irrelevant to teenage pregnancy prevention, ranging from everything from national \nsecurity and immigration, to reorganization of federal agencies, to cultural‑renaming initiatives.21 \nMany of those Executive Orders contain vague, undefined, or underdefined terms. Many have \nbeen enjoined.22 \n136.  The Program Mandate fails to define: how the agency will enforce the request for  \n“alignment” with these Executive Orders; how it expects funding recipients to reconcile potentially \nconflicting directives within these Executive Orders; or the standards or criteria OPA will use to \nevaluate “alignment.” \n137.  The  five  Executive  Orders  identified  as  “most  relevant”  contain  broad  and \nundefined or underdefined terms, leading to significant vagueness concerns.  \n138.  The Program Mandate imposes five content-based mandates: (1) an anti-DEI \nmandate; (2) a prohibition of LGBTQ+ content; (3) an anti-“normalizing” sex mandate; (4) the \nredefining of what qualifies as “medically accurate” information; and (5) the imposition of an opt-\nout requirement. Each of these mandates is unconstitutionally vague. For example, \na.  Anti-DEI mandate: The Program Mandate imposes a vague set of requirements \nprohibiting programming from including “discriminatory equity ideology,” and \n“diversity, equity, or inclusion-related discrimination.” Program Mandate, Ex. C at \n4-5. But the Program Mandate fails to clearly set forth how the agency will define \n“discriminatory equity ideology” and “DEI” in assessing noncompliance. \n \n21 See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14161, 90 Fed. Reg. 8451 (Jan. 20, 2025) (entitled “Protecting the \nUnited States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats”); \nExec.  Order  No.  14222,  90  Fed.  Reg.  11095  (Feb.  26,  2025)  (entitled  “Implementing  the \nPresident’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative”). \n22 See supra note 13. \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 41 of 51\nb.  Prohibition of LGBTQ+ content: The Program Mandate prohibits the inclusion \nof certain LGBTQ+-inclusive content by explicitly banning so-called “gender \nideology”  and  by  referencing the “content  at issue in Mahmoud,”  which  the \nProgram Mandate identifies as “LGBTQ+-inclusive” content. The scope of this \nprohibition is vague. The Program Mandate does not clearly define how the agency \nwill determine which LGBTQ+ content cannot be included in programming or how \nTPP  Programs  are  supposed  to  exclude  “gender  ideology,”  a  vague  and \nunderdefined term.  \nc.  Anti-normalizing  sex  mandate:  The  Program  Mandate  prohibits  TPP \nprogramming from including “content that encourages, normalizes, or promotes \nsexual activity for minors.” The Program Mandate does not define the terms \n“encourages,” “normalizes” or “promotes.” The Program Mandate fails to provide \nany guidance on what materials or instructions it considers to be encouraging, \nnormalizing, or promoting sexual activity for minors, leaving grantees at risk of \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \nd.  Redefining “medically accurate”: While the Program Mandate articulates that \n“OASH is concerned” about several definitions used in prior NOFOs, the Program \nMandate does not identify what exactly in those definitions is “concern[ing]” or \nhow TPP grantees are supposed to modify their programs, if at all, to comply with \nthe concerns within those definitions. The Program Mandate’s new definition of \n“medically  accurate”  in  particular  requires  that  TPP  programming  instruct \nparticipants on the “full range of health risks” associated with contraceptives. This \nmandate is vague and unworkable, inviting arbitrary enforcement.  \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 42 of 51\ne.  Imposition of opt-out requirement: The Program Mandate requires that TPP \nPrograms “provide parents advance notice (including relevant specifics) and the \nability to opt out of any content or activities, especially those related to sexuality, \nthat may burden their religious exercise.” Program Mandate, Ex. C at 3. But the \nProgram Mandate fails to provide any meaningful guidance or standards setting \nforth how the agency will enforce this requirement or assess whether a TPP \nProgram has properly complied with this requirement  \n139.  These open-ended, content-based requirements confer broad discretion on agency \nofficials to determine compliance on an ad hoc basis, enabling arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement untethered to any objective standard. \n140.  Moreover, the vague requirements in the Program Mandate are ripe for arbitrary, \nor even discriminatory enforcement. See Dimaya, 584 U.S. at 182 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n(“Vague laws also threaten to transfer legislative power to police and prosecutors, leaving to them \nthe job of shaping a vague statute’s contours through their enforcement decisions.”); Grayned, 408 \nU.S. at 108-09 (“A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, \nand juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.”). \n141.  As a result, the Program Mandate’s requirements are unconstitutionally vague, \nviolating the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the requirements of the APA, and \nrendering the notices invalid under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n142.  The Program Mandate must be declared unlawful. \n143.  The Program Mandate must be vacated and “set aside” under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n144.  If the Program Mandate is not enjoined, vacated, and declared unlawful, Plaintiffs \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury. \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 43 of 51\n145.  This Court should therefore enjoin the enforcement of the Program Mandate \npending conclusion of these proceedings by ordering Defendants to refrain from relying on the \nProgram Mandate, or its requirements, in making determinations about Plaintiffs’ compliance with \nTPP Program requirements.  \nCOUNT II  \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT – \nTHE PROGRAM MANDATE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE  \nFIRST AMENDMENT \n \n146.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n147.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). The APA \nalso allows the reviewing court to “issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the \neffective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review \nproceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n148.  The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the \nfreedom  of  speech[.]”  U.S.  Const.  amend.  I.  The  government  cannot  “punish  or  suppress \ndisfavored expression,” Nat’l Rifle Ass’n v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175, 188 (2024), or retaliate against \nsuch expression, Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, 585 U.S. 87, 90 (2018). As such, “the \ngovernment may not deprive an individual of a ‘valuable government benefit[]’ in retaliation for \nhis or her exercise of First Amendment rights.” Barton v. Clancy, 632 F.3d 9, 23 (1st Cir. 2011). \nMoreover, the government may not exert undue pressure against First Amendment rights through \na regime of “thinly veiled threats” and “informal censorship.” Am. Ass’n of Univ. Professors v. \nRubio, No. CV 25-10685-WGY, 2025 WL 1235084, at *19 (D. Mass. Apr. 29, 2025) (quoting \nBantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 66-67 (1963)). \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 44 of 51\n149.  The Program Mandate’s vague prohibition on ideologies it deems “harmful” and \nrequirement that TPP grantees instead instruct content that adheres to the Administration’s \npolitical ideologies violates Plaintiffs’ free speech rights and chills protected speech. See, e.g., Am. \nAss’n of Univ. Professors v. Rubio, No. CV 25-10685-WGY, 2025 WL 1235084, at *19 (D. Mass. \nApr. 29, 2025) (noting a regulation “that is unwritten or vague but enforced with harsh penalties \nwould seem more likely to chill broad swaths of speech than one that clearly defines what is \nforbidden”). \n150.  As a result, the Program Mandate’s requirements unconstitutionally chill and \nsuppress  protected  speech,  violating  the  First  Amendment’s  Free  Speech  Clause  and  the \nrequirements of the APA, and rendering the notices invalid under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n151.  The Program Mandate must be declared unlawful. \n152.  The Program Mandate must be vacated and “set aside” under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n153.  If the Program Mandate is not enjoined, vacated, and declared unlawful, Plaintiffs \nwill suffer substantial injury. \nCOUNT III   \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT – \nTHE PROGRAM MANDATE IS CONTRARY TO LAW \n \n154.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs.  \n155.  Under the APA, courts shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). The APA also allows reviewing courts to “issue all necessary and appropriate process \nto postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion \nof the review proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 45 of 51\n156.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706, authorizes federal courts to set aside agency action that \nis contrary to law. \n157.  The  statutory  authority  for  the  TPP  Program,  as  provided  in  the  relevant \nappropriations statutes, allocates funds for “medically accurate and age appropriate programs that \nreduce teen pregnancy,” with specific allocation Tier 1 funding “for replicating programs that have \nbeen proven effective through rigorous evaluation.” 138 Stat. at 671. \n158.  The Program Mandate’s requirements for grantees to “align” their programs with \nExecutive Orders and adhere to certain content mandates imposes additional obligations not \ncontemplated by, and inconsistent with, the statutory framework established by Congress for the \nTPP Program. \n159.  Contrary to the statutory requirement that TPP programs be “medically accurate,” \nthe Program Mandate requires Plaintiffs to “align” with medically inaccurate Executive Orders \nand adhere to medically inaccurate assertions about sex. \n160.  For Tier 1 projects, Congress has mandated that Tier 1 funding be used for \n“replicating programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation to reduce \nteenage pregnancy, behavioral risk factors underlying teenage pregnancy, or other associated risk \nfactors.” 138 Stat. at 671. The Program Mandate violates the statutory requirement that Tier 1 \nprograms “replicat[e] programs that have been proven effective,” because it expressly “require[s] \nsome grantees to revise their TPP Program curricula and content”—apparently on an ad hoc \nbasis—to adhere the Program Mandate’s newly imposed requirements. \n161.  By imposing funding requirements contrary to law on Plaintiffs’ ongoing funding, \nthe Program Mandate constitutes agency action that is not in accordance with law, in violation of \nthe APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 46 of 51\n162.  The Program Mandate must be declared unlawful. \n163.  The Program Mandate must be vacated and “set aside” under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n164.  If the Program Mandate is not enjoined, vacated, and declared unlawful, Plaintiffs \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury. \n165.  This Court should therefore enjoin the enforcement of the Program Mandate \npending conclusion of these proceedings by ordering Defendants to refrain from relying on the \nProgram Mandate in making determinations about Plaintiffs’ compliance with TPP Program \nrequirements.  \nCOUNT IV \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT – \nTHE PROGRAM MANDATE IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS  \n \n166.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n167.  Under the APA a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The APA also allows the \nreviewing court to “issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of \nan agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 705. \n168.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706, authorizes federal courts to set aside agency action that \nis arbitrary and capricious. \n169.  The Program Mandate’s requirements are arbitrary and capricious because the \nagency fails to provide any reasoned explanation for (a) imposing these new mandates or (b) how \nthe agency will enforce these mandates in assessing noncompliance. There is no evidence that the \nagency considered, for example: \na.  Whether the Executive Orders bear any rational nexus to teen-pregnancy outcomes; \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 47 of 51\nb.  The scientific evidence that inclusive programming increases the effectiveness of \nTPP programs; \nc.  How alignment with each Executive Order could be operationalized and content \nmandates imposed in evidence-based curricula; \nd.  The significant risk of undermining Plaintiffs’ contractual agreements; \ne.  The nature and degree of Plaintiffs’ reasonable reliance interests—including prior \nresources and investments in developing and implementing specific, agency pre-\napproved programming under earlier guidance; \nf.  The burdens imposed by requiring TPP Programs to modify content and materials \nof pre-approved programs;  \ng.  Whether already-approved, evidence-based programs can be modified to adhere to \nthe new content requirements and, if so, whether those changes will nullify the \neffectiveness of the programs and violate the statutory mandates; \nh.  The impact that the new requirements could have on Plaintiffs’ partnerships and \nthe young people who benefit from Plaintiffs’ TPP programing, which Plaintiffs \nintentionally  implemented  in  high-risk  and  high-need  communities  at  HHS’s \nrequest; \ni.  Potential conflicts between the objectives of the Executive Orders and content \nmandates and the criteria endorsed by HHS’s own TPPER; \nj.  Potential conflicts with state laws that require sexual education to be, inter alia, \nmedically accurate, comprehensive, and/or inclusive; \nk.  Whether any exceptions or hardship waivers would be provided for grantees unable \nto comply; \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 48 of 51\nl.  Seeking  or  considering  feedback  from  existing  TPP  grantees,  state  health \ndepartments, community‐based partners, and other impacted stakeholders on the \nfeasibility and impact of the new requirements; \nm. Less intrusive means of advancing any legitimate policy goals before imposing a \nbinding, high-stakes requirement. \n170.  The Program Mandate is arbitrary and capricious because the agency provided no \nempirical justification or reasoned analysis for the requirements in the Program Mandate. \n171.  The Program Mandate’s purported delineation of activities outside of the scope of \nthe TPP Program is also arbitrary and capricious because it failed to provide good reason for \nadopting these definitions, failed to consider an important aspect of the problem in the imposition \nof  its  new  additional  requirements  and  restrictions,  imposed    additional  requirements  and \nrestrictions on TPP grantees that are contrary to statutory mandate, the purpose of the program, \nadopts  internally  inconsistent  reasoning,  unjustifiably  changed  existing  policy,  and  are \nunsupported by substantial scientific evidence.  \n172.  Moreover, the Program Mandate is so vague in what it purports to require that it \nfails to provide “fair notice” and “reasoned decision-making” required by the APA. \n173.  By imposing requirements that are arbitrary and capricious, the Program Mandate \nconstitutes agency action that is not in accordance with law, in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n174.  The Program Mandate must be declared unlawful. \n175.  The Program Mandate must be vacated and “set aside” under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n176.  If the Program Mandate is not enjoined, vacated, and declared unlawful, Plaintiffs \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury. \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 49 of 51\n177.  This Court should therefore enjoin the enforcement of the Program Mandate \npending conclusion of these proceedings by ordering Defendants to refrain from relying on the \nProgram Mandate, in making determinations about Plaintiffs’ compliance with TPP Program \nrequirements. \nCOUNT V \nTHE PROGRAM MANDATE IS ULTRA VIRES \n \n178.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n179.  HHS, through its officials, may exercise only the authority conferred by statute. \n180.  The TPP Program, as provided in the relevant appropriations statutes, allocates \nfunds for “medically accurate and age appropriate programs that reduce teen pregnancy,” with \nspecific allocation “for replicating programs that have been proven effective through rigorous \nevaluation” and “for research and demonstration grants to develop, replicate, refine, and test \nadditional models and innovative strategies for preventing teenage pregnancy.” 138 Stat. at 671.  \n181.  The Program Mandate’s requirements for grantees to align their programs with \nspecific Executive Orders and to adhere to certain content mandates imposes additional obligations \nnot contemplated by the statutory framework established by Congress for the TPP Program. \n182.  Moreover, Defendants’ actions are patently outside of their statutory authority \nbecause the Program Mandate, which requires Plaintiffs to “align” with medically inaccurate \nExecutive Orders and adhere to medically inaccurate assertions about sex, is incompatible with \nCongress’ mandate that TPP Programs be “medically accurate.” \n183.  By  conditioning  access  to  awarded  appropriated  funds  on  compliance  with \nstandardless requirements irreconcilable with Congress’ criteria, Defendants have violated the \nseparation of powers and encroached upon Congress’s Spending authority and thereby acted ultra \nvires. \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 50 of 51\n184.  The Program Mandate must be declared unlawful. \n185.  If the Program Mandate is not declared unlawful, Plaintiffs will suffer substantial \ninjury, including irreparable injury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request an order: \na)  declaring unlawful the new requirements imposed in the Program Mandate; \nb)  enjoining  the  enforcement  of  the  Program  Mandate  pending  conclusion  of  these \nproceedings by permitting Plaintiffs to operate their programs and draw down funds for \nYear 3 under their approved NCC Applications, so long as they remain in compliance with \nthe Materials Review Guidance dated January 2025; \nc)  ordering  Defendants  to  refrain  from  relying  on  the  Program  Mandate  in  making \ndeterminations about Plaintiffs’ current and ongoing funding; \nd)  vacating and setting aside the Program Mandate under 5 U.S.C. § 706; \ne)  preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants, their agents, employees, appointees, \nsuccessors,  and  anyone  acting  in  concert  or  participation  with  Defendants  from \nimplementing, maintaining, or giving effect to the new requirements in the Program \nMandate; \nf)  requiring HHS to submit status reports every 30-days after the date of the entry of the \nCourt’s order to ensure prompt and complete compliance with the Court’s directive, up and \nuntil HHS completely complies with the Court’s directive in its entirety; \ng)  awarding Plaintiffs reasonable costs and attorney’s fees in accordance with law including \nbut not limited to 28 U.S.C. § 2412; and \nh)  issuing any and all other such relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02453     Document 1     Filed 07/29/25     Page 51 of 51\nDated: July 29, 2025        Respectfully submitted,  \n            By:   /s/ Andrew T.
