    "summary": "<p>In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an \"Endangerment Finding,\" concluding that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare. This finding, based on extensive peer-reviewed scientific research, led to regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. However, in March 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) created a secret Climate Working Group. The group, composed of individuals known for their skepticism of climate science, was tasked with creating a report to provide a \"balanced\" view and challenge the existing scientific consensus. The group's report was submitted to the EPA in May 2025 and was allegedly used by the EPA to justify a proposed rule to rescind the Endangerment Finding. This case challenges the proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 12, 2025, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the DOE and its Secretary, the EPA and its Administrator, and the Climate Working Group. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions were ultra vires and violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Administrative Procedure Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent CWG from meeting or acting until the defendants complied with FACA; an order requiring disclosure of all emails, draft documents, and related records to the plaintiffs and the public; an order enjoining the DOE and EPA from using or relying on the CWG&rsquo;s report; and a writ of mandamus compelling the defendants to perform their duties under FACA.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated FACA by creating a secret, unaccountable advisory group whose existence, meetings, and records were concealed from the public. They further argued that the group&rsquo;s five members were deliberately selected for their skepticism of climate science, which was contrary to FACA&rsquo;s requirements for transparency and balanced representation. Additionally, the plaintiffs argued under the Administrative Procedure Act that the EPA&rsquo;s proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding was arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful because it relied on a report produced by the CWG, which had been established in violation of FACA. They maintained that because the report resulted from a tainted process, any agency action grounded in it was invalid.</p>\r\n<p>On August 12, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction, stay, or alternatively, summary judgment. The plaintiffs asserted they faced irreparable harm from being excluded from the group&rsquo;s meetings and records, and that the public interest favored transparency in climate policymaking. In the alternative, they requested summary judgment, arguing that the record already established FACA violations beyond dispute.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs alleged that the DOE unlawfully created the CWG, a secret advisory group composed of climate science skeptics, in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). They argued that the EPA’s reliance on the CWG’s report rendered its proposed rescission arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to block the CWG from meeting, disclosure of its records, a prohibition on using its report, and a writ of mandamus to enforce FACA duties. On August 12, 2025, they moved for a preliminary injunction, a stay, or alternatively summary judgment, citing irreparable harm and the public interest in transparency. This case is ongoing.",

The causes of climate change and the resulting harms to millions of people are \namong the most important scientific issues that federal policymakers have ever confronted. The \nfederal government’s science-based regulation of greenhouse gas emissions is vital to protecting \nand advancing public health, a flourishing economy, a healthy environment, and the livability of \nour planet for generations to come. \n2.  In 2009, faced with a mountain of scientific data on the human causes and \ndevastating effects of climate change, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally \ndetermined that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare of the American people, \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 2 of 40\n \nand that emissions from motor vehicles and engines contribute to the greenhouse gas pollution \nthat threatens public health and welfare (the “Endangerment Finding”). The Endangerment \nFinding reflects the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community—conclusions that \nmajor American and international scientific bodies and the federal government have reaffirmed \ntime and again since the Endangerment Finding was first issued, including during the first Trump \nadministration. This science-based assessment of the causes of climate change and the harms that \nit is already inflicting on the American people, which EPA issued after a transparent rulemaking \nprocess with a full opportunity for public comment, has underpinned EPA actions to reduce \nclimate-disrupting pollution from new cars and trucks and other sources.    \n3.  But now, in the span of a few months, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and \nEPA have sought to manufacture a basis to reject this overwhelming scientific consensus. And \nthey have done so through a plan hatched and carried out in secret. In March 2025, shortly after \nbeing confirmed to office, Secretary of Energy Christopher Wright quietly arranged for five \nhand-picked skeptics of the effects of climate change to form a Climate Working Group. Wright \ntasked the group with preparing a report that would provide “balance” against the consensus \nviews of climate scientists1 and “cut against the prevailing narrative that climate change is an \nexistential threat.”2  \n4.   The Climate Working Group worked in secret for months to produce a report for \nDOE and EPA that would provide justification for their predetermined goal of rescinding the \nEndangerment Finding. In May, unbeknownst to the public, the group transmitted its report to \nEPA, and EPA then relied extensively on the report in preparing its proposal to rescind the \n \n1 Climate Working Group, A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions at viii (July 23, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/Y6QJ-QYQR. \n2 Travis Fisher, Why I Helped Organize the Department of Energy’s Climate Report, CATO at Liberty (Aug. 6, \n2025, 10:25 AM), https://perma.cc/CQ87-WCYF. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 3 of 40\n \nEndangerment Finding. It was not until the same day that EPA released that proposal, July 29, \nthat the existence and work of the group was made public. Secrecy was so important to \nDefendants that when the New York Times asked one of the group’s members in early July \nabout his role at DOE, the member obscured his work for the group and simply said that he is an \n“unpaid person who’s available to them if they need it.”3       \n5.  But federal law does not permit agencies to create or rely on such secret, \nunaccountable groups when engaged in policymaking. In the Federal Advisory Committee Act \n(FACA), Congress mandated transparency in the establishment and operation of any federal \nadvisory committee, including by requiring that the group’s formation be promptly disclosed and \nthat its meetings, emails, and other records be open to the public. Here, Defendants did not \ndisclose the Climate Working Group’s existence until months after it began working, and not a \nsingle meeting or record has been made public other than the group’s report. Defendants also \nviolated FACA’s prohibition on stacking an advisory committee with adherents of only one point \nof view; the Climate Working Group’s members were all chosen for their skepticism of climate \nscience, and the group does not have a single member that agrees with the consensus of the \noverwhelming majority of the scientific community on the effects of climate change. \n6.

In 2009, EPA issued the “Endangerment Finding,” a determination that \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future \ngenerations, and that emissions from motor vehicles and engines contribute to the greenhouse \ngas pollution that threatens public health and welfare. See Endangerment and Cause or \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 7 of 40\n \nContribute Finding for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, 74 Fed. \nReg. 66,496 (Dec. 15, 2009).  \n22.  The EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding was supported by an “ocean of \nevidence.” Coal. for Responsible Regul., Inc. v. EPA, 684 F.3d 102, 123 (D.C. Cir. 2012), cert. \ndenied in relevant part sub nom. Chamber of Commerce v. EPA, 571 U.S. 951 (2013). Following \nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), which held that \nEPA has clear authority to regulate greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act, EPA \nembarked on a lengthy evaluation process that involved several rounds of public input—\nincluding over 380,000 comments and two public hearings, rigorous peer review, and an \nexhaustive investigation of contemporary climate science literature. See 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,500, \n66,510. EPA’s final finding rested on a vast body of rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific research \nconfirming that greenhouse gas pollution is driving destructive changes in our climate that pose a \ngrave and growing threat to Americans’ health, security, and economic well-being.  \n23.  Over time, the scientific evidence supporting the Endangerment Finding has only \nbecome stronger. The interagency expert body charged by Congress with assessing the impacts \nof climate change on the United States—the U.S. Global Change Research Program—has issued \na series of National Climate Assessments, most recently by the Trump Administration in 2018 \nand the Biden Administration in 2023. Each Assessment has been developed through a rigorous \nprocess involving peer review, public comment, and expert review by the National Academy of \nSciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Those National Climate Assessments confirm that climate \nchange resulting from greenhouse gas emissions is causing extensive and increasingly severe \nharms throughout the country, including stronger hurricanes with more intense flooding that can \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 8 of 40\n \ndamage property and harm people, and more frequent and intense heat waves that contribute to \nincreased illnesses and medical emergencies.4 Climate change from greenhouse gas emissions \nhas increased dry conditions across the Western United States and helped to fuel wildfires that \nendanger homes and businesses, threaten basic services like electricity provision, and directly \naffect the health and lives of people.  \n24.  Since its issuance in 2009, the Endangerment Finding has provided support for \nvarious EPA actions to limit climate pollution from coal- and gas-fired power plants, new \npassenger cars and trucks as well as medium and heavy-duty freight trucks and buses, and the oil \nand gas industry. See, e.g., Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and \nCorporate Average Fuel Economy Standards, 75 Fed. Reg. 25,324 (May 7, 2010).  \n25.  On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order directing the \nEPA Administrator to work with other agency heads to submit recommendations on the “legality \nand continuing applicability” of EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding. See Executive Order \n14154, Unleashing American Energy, § 6(f). That same executive order condemned what the \nPresident called “burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations” that have “impeded the \ndevelopment of” fossil fuels. See id. § 1.  \n26.  In March 2025, consistent with the President’s direction, EPA Administrator Lee \nZeldin announced EPA’s intention to reconsider the Endangerment Finding.5 The Administrator \n \n4 The government recently took down the website that hosted the most recent edition of the National Climate \nAssessment.

Because the overwhelming scientific consensus—and the federal government’s \nown expert analyses and reports—demonstrate the lack of any scientific basis to reconsider the \nEndangerment Finding, the Administration decided to manufacture purported expert opinions \nupon which the Administration could rely.  \n28.  Specifically, in March 2025, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright secretly devised a \nplan to convene a “climate working group” of individuals from outside the government.7 The \nexpress purpose of the group would be to issue a report that would “challenge the mainstream \nconsensus”8 and “cut against the prevailing narrative that climate change is an existential \nthreat.”9 The existence and work of the group was not publicly disclosed until July 29, 2025, the \nsame day that EPA released its notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind the Endangerment \nFinding. \n29.  From the outset, Secretary Wright knew who he wanted to serve on the working \ngroup. The Secretary asked Travis Fisher, the director of energy and environmental policy \nstudies at the Cato Institute, to assemble Drs. John Christy, Judith Curry, Steven Koonin, Ross \nMcKitrick, and Roy Spencer, to serve as members of the working group. Wright personally \ncalled the members to ask them to serve on the working group.10 All five of these individuals \n \n6 Id. \n7 Fisher, supra note 2. \n8 CWG Report at x. \n9 Fisher, supra note 2. \n10 Benjamin Storrow, How Chris Wright Recruited a Team to Upend Climate Science, E&E News (Aug. 11, 2025, \n6:15 AM), https://perma.cc/TNJ5-J4M4. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 10 of 40\n \nhave a history of questioning the impacts of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions on climate \nchange, and asserting that leading scientific assessments have overstated the impacts of climate \nchange on human health and welfare and that the costs of climate change mitigation exceed the \nbenefits.  \n30.  Dr. Christy is well known for his questioning of established, peer-reviewed \nclimate science and raising doubts about the extent to which human activity has caused global \nwarming.11 He has been linked in the past to the Heartland Institute, an advocacy group that \nfrequently questions the scientific consensus on climate change.12 In a 2007 editorial in the Wall \nStreet Journal, Christy wrote that he “see[s] neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking \ngun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see,” a view that he \nacknowledged was out of step with a “majority” of his climate scientist colleagues.13 In \ntestimony to Congress on multiple occasions, Christy has argued that climate models should not \nbe used for predicting future changes in climate or for policy decisions.14 \n31.  On July 8, 2025, it was reported that Christy was listed in DOE’s internal registry \nas an “expert” assisting Secretary Wright. When asked by the New York Times in July about this \nrole, Christy affirmatively obscured his work for the Climate Working Group, stating that he was \nan “unpaid person who’s available to them if they need it.”15 Christy’s role with the group was \nnot publicly disclosed until the release of its report on July 29. \n \n11 Joselow, supra note 3. \n12 Andrew Zinin, U.S. Energy Department Misrepresents Climate Science in New Report, Phys.org (Aug. 1, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/V84A-3XZ7. \n13John R.

Dr. Curry founded a private weather forecasting company, Climate Forecast \nApplications Network, that provides paid consulting services to clients with interests in limiting \nthe government’s role in addressing climate change, such as oil companies, electric utilities, and \nnatural gas energy traders. Like Christy, Curry has been linked to the Heartland Institute. She \nalso hosts a blog, Climate Etc., which has been described as part of the climate change “denial \nblogosphere.”16 In a 2010 profile in Scientific American, Curry accused the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change, which most climate scientists view as representing the “consensus on \nclimate science,” of “corruption.”17 Curry’s role on the Climate Working Group was not publicly \ndisclosed until the release of the CWG Report on July 29. \n33.  Dr. Koonin is a Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution and \nformerly served as a non-resident Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Koonin \npreviously worked for five years as the Chief Scientist for BP. In 2019, Koonin was reportedly \none of the main drivers behind the effort at EPA to launch a “red-team, blue team” exercise to \nquestion broadly supported conclusions in climate science.18 In 2021, Koonin published a book \non climate change that was widely condemned for promoting climate denial, “cherry-pick[ing] \nand misrepresent[ing] outdated material to downplay the seriousness of the climate crisis.”19 On \nJuly 8, 2025, it was reported that Koonin was listed as a “special government employee” in \nDOE’s internal registry. Koonin’s role on the Climate Working Group was not publicly \ndisclosed, however, until the release of the CWG Report on July 29.

Dr. McKitrick is a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, a Canadian libertarian \nthink tank known for promoting skepticism about the benefits and effectiveness of climate \nregulations. McKitrick has several affiliations with organizations denying the consensus view on \nclimate change, including serving on the academic advisory board of the Global Warming \nFoundation. McKitrick is also an endorser of the Cornwall Alliance’s “An Evangelical \nDeclaration on Global Warming,” which denies that carbon dioxide is a pollutant and opposes \nclimate mitigation policies. McKitrick’s role on the Climate Working Group was not publicly \ndisclosed until the release of the CWG Report on July 29. \n35.  Dr. Spencer is a Principal Research Scientist at the University of Alabama in \nHuntsville. He is a long-time skeptic of the well-supported and assessed findings of climate \nscience and is affiliated with several organizations promoting those views, including the \nHeartland Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the Cornwall Alliance. In describing his \nparticipation on the Climate Working Group, Spencer stated, regarding climate change: “It’s just \nnot a ‘crisis,’ and nothing we see in severe weather has been tied to human greenhouse gas \nemissions.”20 Spencer has testified in support of fossil fuel companies in the past, such as his \n2015 testimony before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on behalf of Peabody Energy, \na coal company.21 Spencer’s role on the Climate Working Group was not publicly disclosed until \nthe release of the CWG Report on July 29. \n \n20 Roy Spencer, The DOE Scientific Report Underpinning the EPA’s Decision to Reconsider the 2009 \nEndangerment Finding (July 29, 2025), https://perma.cc/CY5X-N2CJ. \n21 John Abraham, Peabody Coal’s Contrarian Scientist Witnesses Lose Their Court Case, The Guardian (May 2, \n2016), https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/may/02/peabody- \ncoals-contrarian-scientist-witnesses-lose-their-court-case. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 13 of 40\n \n36.  The members of the Climate Working Group have a history of working together \nto advance their views relating to climate change.22 In 2017, when the then-EPA Administrator \nproposed the idea of pitting “climate contrarians” against their mainstream counterparts in a “red \nteam, blue team” exercise, the Heartland Institute sent EPA a list of climate skeptics that \nincluded four of the report’s authors—Christy, Curry, Koonin, and Spencer.23 Dr. Spencer \nrecently stated that Secretary Wright “asked who I would recommend for other authors of the \nreport,” and Wright “had on his list of potential contributors the others who now appear on the \nreport with me.”24 \n37.  All five authors are well known for holding “contrarian views on climate science \nthat are out of step with the mainstream.”25 None of the members represents the overwhelming \nconsensus view among climate scientists that human activities, “principally through emissions of \ngreenhouse gases,” have “unequivocally” caused global warming, that widespread and rapid \nchanges in the atmosphere have occurred that are already affecting weather and climate extremes \nthroughout the globe, that climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health, \nand that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a discernible slowdown in global \nwarming that would reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems.26  \n \n22 Richard Banks, WBHM, Alabama’s John Christy May Be The Country’s Best Known And Most Criticized \nClimate Change Skeptic (Sept. 1, 2023), https://perma.cc/96DR-53H9 (noting that Dr. Christy reached his \nconclusions on climate change while working with Dr. Spencer); American Physical Society, Climate Change \nStatement Review Workshop, https://perma.cc/JU9Z-UTV2 (transcript of a forum coordinated by Dr. Koonin and \nfeaturing Dr. Christy and Dr. Curry to argue against consensus views of climate change). \n23 Storrow, supra note 10. \n24 Spencer, supra note 20. \n25 Paul Voosen, Contrarian Climate Assessment From U.S. Government Draws Swift Pushback, Science (July 30, \n2025, 5:45 PM), https://www.science.org/content/article/contrarian-climate-assessment-u-s-government \n-draws-swift-pushback/. \n26 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2023 Synthesis Report: Summary for \nPolicymakers, https://perma.cc/J7HH-9JD5.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 14 of 40\n \n38.  By April 2025, DOE had assembled the Climate Working Group, and it began \nworking in secret on its report. Over the next two months, the group sought to rewrite decades of \nclimate science research.  \n39.  On May 27, 2025, the working group submitted its report to Secretary Wright, \nand the report was contemporaneously sent to EPA. According to Curry, although the group \ncompleted the CWG Report in May, its publication “was delayed to coincide with the release of \nEPA’s proposal” to rescind the Endangerment Finding.27 \n40.  On July 29, 2025, DOE published the CWG Report, titled A Critical Review of \nImpacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.  \n41.  Secretary Wright wrote a foreword in the report. There, he confirmed that he \n“commissioned this report” to “provide clarity and balance,” because he believes that “media \ncoverage often distorts the science” of climate change.28 He criticized the mainstream narrative \nthat places too much blame on “hydrocarbon-based fuels” and acknowledged that the report’s \nconclusions “differ in important ways from the mainstream narrative.” Id. Although the report is \nlabeled a draft, Wright concluded that “it faithfully reports the state of climate science today.” Id. \n42.

In the CWG Report, the authors assert that DOE commissioned the report to \nadvise the federal government on “climate science relevant for energy policymaking.”  \n45.  Carrying out this mandate, CWG Report advises policymakers that “U.S. policy \nactions are expected to have undetectably small direct impacts on the global climate and any \neffects will emerge only with long delays.” The report is replete with conclusions and advice \naimed at policymakers, such as that the economic effects of carbon-dioxide-induced warming \n“are too small to justify aggressive abatement policy and that trying to ‘stop’ or cap global \nwarming . . . would be worse than doing nothing.”31 \n46.  The CWG Report also advises broadly that global warming is on balance more \nbeneficial than harmful, that cold temperatures are the greater threat, and that extreme weather \nevents are no worse than they have been historically.  \n47.  Climate scientists immediately denounced the report, noting that “[t]o say that \n[the report’s] claims defy the consensus is an understatement.”32 Joellen Russell, an \noceanographer at the University of Arizona, observed that the report “is basically designed to \nsuppress science.”33  \n48.

When a federal agency establishes an advisory committee like the Climate \nWorking Group, the agency must comply with the requirements of the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (FACA).  \n56.  Congress enacted FACA in 1972 in response to concerns that federal advisory \ncommittees were neither transparent nor accountable to the American people. See Meghan M. \nStuessy & Kathleen E. Marchsteiner, Cong. Research Serv., R47984, The Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (FACA): Overview and Considerations for Congress 1 (2024). Specifically, \n“[t]he lack of public scrutiny of the activities of advisory committees was found to pose the \ndanger that subjective influence not in the public interest could be exerted on . . . Federal \ndecisionmakers.” Id. (quoting Senate Comm. on Gov’t Operations, The Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act, report to accompany S. 3529, 92nd Cong., 2nd sess., September 7, 1972, S. Rept. \n92-1098 (1972)). \n57.  Congress accordingly passed FACA to enhance “the public accountability of \nadvisory committees established by the Executive Branch.” Pub. Citizen v. DOJ, 491 U.S. 440, \n459 (1989). Congress formally found and declared, among other things, that “new advisory \ncommittees should be established only when they are determined to be essential and their \nnumber should be kept to the minimum necessary,” “standards and uniform procedures should \ngovern the establishment, operation, administration, and duration of advisory committees,” and \n“Congress and the public should be kept informed with respect to the number, purpose, \nmembership, activities, and cost of advisory committees.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 1002(b)(2), (4), (5). \n58.  Congress also sought to “ensure that persons or groups directly affected by the \nwork of a particular advisory committee would have some representation on the committee.” \nNat’l Anti-Hunger Coal. v. Exec. Comm. of President’s Priv. Sector Surv. on Cost Control, 711 \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 19 of 40\n \nF.2d 1071, 1074 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Congress was particularly concerned that “special interest \ngroups may use their membership on [advisory committees] to promote their private concerns,” \nciting as an example an Industrial Waste Committee where “[n]o representatives of conservation, \nenvironment, clean water, consumer, or other public interest groups were present.” H.R. Rep. \nNo. 92-1017, at 6 (1972), as reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3491, 3496. \n59.  To achieve its goals, FACA imposes a number of requirements on the \nestablishment, operations, and use of federal advisory committees. FACA broadly defines an \n“advisory committee” as any “committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task \nforce, or other similar group . . . established or utilized to obtain advice or recommendations for \nthe President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government and that is . . . \nestablished or utilized by one or more agencies.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 1001(2)(A)(iii), 1003(a). \n60.  FACA’s implementing regulations require that, before forming a new advisory \ncommittee, an agency head must first consult with the General Service Administration’s \nCommittee Management Secretariat (the “Secretariat”). 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.60(a). As part of this \nconsultation, agency heads “should provide the Secretariat with a full understanding of the \nbackground and purpose behind the advisory committee.” Id. The agency head “must” provide \nan explanation as to “why the advisory committee is essential to the conduct of agency business \nand in the public interest” and “why the advisory committee’s functions cannot be performed by \nthe agency, another existing committee, or other means such as a public hearing.” Id. § 102-\n3.60(b)(1)-(2). \n61.  Once the Secretariat completes its review, the agency then “must” publish a \nnotice in the Federal Register announcing that the advisory committee is being established. Id. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 20 of 40\n \n§ 102-3.65(a). The notice “must describe the nature and purpose of the advisory committee and \naffirm that the advisory committee is necessary and in the public interest.” Id. \n62.  Every advisory committee must also have a charter. 5 U.S.C. § 1008(c)(1). The \ncommittee “shall not meet or take any action until [the] advisory committee charter has been \nfiled” with “the head of the agency to whom the advisory committee reports; and . . . the \nstanding committees of the Senate and House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction \nover the agency to which the advisory committee reports.” Id.; see also 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.70. \nThe charter “shall contain,” among other information, “the committee’s official designation,” the \ncommittee’s “objectives and the scope of its activity,” a “description of the duties for which the \ncommittee is responsible,” and “the estimated number and frequency of committee meetings.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 1008(c)(2); see also 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.75. The charter is then uploaded to a FACA \ndatabase and can be accessed and downloaded from www.facadatabase.gov.  \n63.  Agency heads must also designate an officer “to chair or attend each meeting of \n[the] advisory committee,” and the committee “shall not conduct any meeting in the absence of \nthat designated officer or employee of the Federal Government.” 5 U.S.C. § 1009(e); see also 41 \nC.F.R. § 102-3.120. \n64.  FACA also imposes procedural and substantive requirements for selecting the \nmembers of an advisory committee.  \n65.  Substantively, committee membership must be “fairly balanced in terms of the \npoints of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 1004(b)(2).  \n66.  The agency forming an advisory committee also must make “appropriate \nprovisions to assure that the advice and recommendations of the advisory committee will not be \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 21 of 40\n \ninappropriately influenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest, but will instead \nbe the result of the advisory committee’s independent judgment.” Id. § 1004(b)(3).  \n67.  Agencies must follow myriad procedural steps in furtherance of these substantive \nrequirements, including to provide GSA a “Membership Balance Plan” describing how the \nagency will “attain fairly balanced membership, as appropriate based on the nature and functions \nof the advisory committee.” 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.60(b)(3). The plan “must be uploaded to the \nFACA database when the agency files the Federal advisory committee charter with [GSA].” Id. \nThe plan “shall describe the agency’s conclusions regarding the points of view that would \npromote fairly balanced committee membership,” and “shall describe the agency’s intended \nselection criteria and approach.” Id. § 102-3.60(b)(3)(i). \n68.  Once the agency “identifie[s] the points of view that would promote a fairly \nbalanced advisory committee membership,” agencies must “conduct broad outreach, using a \nvariety of means and methods, to ensure that the call for nominees reaches the interested parties \nand stakeholder groups likely to possess those points of view.” Id. § 103.360(b)(3)(ii). The \nmembership balance plan “shall describe the agency’s intended outreach efforts to accomplish \nthese goals.” Id. \n69.  DOE’s own manual on advisory committees emphasizes these requirements. See \nDOE, Advisory Committee Management Program Manual (“DOE Manual”) at 20 (2007), \nhttps://perma.cc/FVE9-BZ9D. The manual requires that the proposal package for a new advisory \ncommittee include an “Action Memorandum” addressed to the Secretary of Energy, which “must \ninclude,” among other things, “[a] description of the plan for ensuring a fairly balanced \ncommittee membership in terms of the viewpoints represented and the functions to be \nperformed.” Id. at 20. Proposal packages for advisory committee appointments must likewise \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 22 of 40\n \ninclude “a matrix/table presenting the members’ attributes (e.g., geographic location; residential, \nor commercial consumer) to demonstrate that balance criteria have been met.” Id. at 40. To \nensure balanced membership, “[c]onsideration will also be given to factors such as the \ngeographic region of the country; minority groups; women’s organizations; public and private \nacademic institutions, including Black colleges and universities; physically challenged \nindividuals and groups; and the public at large.” Id. at 37. \n70.  Once a committee is established and begins its work, FACA imposes significant \ntransparency requirements on the committee’s operations.  \n71.  With limited exceptions, all “meetings” of the advisory committee members must \nbe open to the public. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(a); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.150(a). FACA’s implementing \nregulations broadly define a “meeting” as “any gathering of advisory committee members \n(whether in person or electronically, such as using telecommunications or through a virtual \nplatform), held with the approval of an agency, and with a Designated Federal Officer in \nattendance, for the purpose of deliberating on the matters upon which the advisory committee \nprovides advice or recommendations.” 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.25. \n72.  All meetings must be timely noticed in the Federal Register, at least fifteen days \nbefore the meeting is to be held. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(a); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.150(a). \n73.  Interested members of the public must also “be permitted to attend, appear before, \nor file statements with any advisory committee,” subject only to “such reasonable rules or \nregulations as the Administrator [of General Services] may prescribe.” 5 U.S.C. § 1009(a)(3). \nEach advisory committee meeting must be “held at a reasonable time and in a manner or place \nreasonably accessible to the public,” and in a place sufficient to accommodate “a reasonable \nnumber of interested members of the public.” 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.140(a)(1)-(2). And if an \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 23 of 40\n \nadvisory committee meeting is conducted through an “electronic medium,” such as \nteleconference or videoconference, it still must be accessible to the public. Id. § 102-3.140(a)(5). \n74.  FACA imposes open records requirements as well. Section 10(b) of FACA \nprovides that “the records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, \nstudies, agenda, or other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by each \nadvisory committee shall be available for public inspection and copying at a single location in \nthe offices of the advisory committee or the agency to which the advisory committee reports,” \nsubject only to FOIA’s disclosure exceptions (except advisory committees may not invoke the \ndeliberative process privilege to shield FACA records). 5 U.S.C. § 1009(b); see Heartwood, Inc. \nv. U.S. Forest Serv., 431 F. Supp. 2d 28, 36 (D.D.C. 2006). \n75.  FACA also requires that “[d]etailed minutes of each meeting of each advisory \ncommittee shall be kept and shall contain a record of the persons present, a complete and \naccurate description of matters discussed and conclusions reached, and copies of all reports \nreceived, issued, or approved by the advisory committee.” Id. § 1009(c). Transcripts of advisory \ncommittee meetings “shall” be made available to the public. Id. § 1010(b). \n76.  Federal agencies must proactively make available all records and materials \nsubject to disclosure; members of the public need not submit a records request as would be \nneeded under FOIA. Food Chem. News v. HHS, 980 F.2d 1468, 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Thus, \n“agencies may not require members of the public or other interested parties to use FOIA \nprocedures in order to obtain records available under sec. 10(b) of the Act.” 41 C.F.R. § 102-\n3.170. The regulations further confirm that “Section 10(b) of the Act . . . provides for the \ncontemporaneous availability of advisory committee records.” Id. (emphasis added). \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 24 of 40\n \n77.  “Official records generated by or for an advisory committee must be retained for \nthe duration of the advisory committee. Upon termination of the advisory committee, the records \nmust be processed in accordance with the Federal Records Act.” 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.175(e). \nMembers of Advisory Committees Are Subject to Ethical Requirements  \n78.  Advisory committee members are also subject to ethics restrictions and \nrequirements. \n79.  As is typically the case across the government, for advisory committees \nestablished by DOE, “[m]embers serving as experts” rather than representatives of a group “must \nbe appointed as SGEs,” meaning special government employees. DOE Manual at II-3. \n80.  Under federal law, SGEs may not “participate[] personally and substantially,” \nincluding through “the rendering of advice,” in any “particular matter in which, to his \nknowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as \nofficer, director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom \nhe is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial \ninterest.” 18 U.S.C. § 208(a). A “particular matter” includes “policy-making that is narrowly \nfocused on the interests of such a discrete and identifiable class of persons,” but “does not extend \nto the consideration or adoption of broad policy options that are directed to the interests of a \nlarge and diverse group of persons.” 5 C.F.R. § 2635.402(b)(3). \n81.  The DOE Manual likewise provides that “[a]dvisory committee members must \nnot participate in particular matters before the committee, such as grants or contracts, that might \nhave a direct and predictable impact on the companies, organizations, or agencies with which \nthey are associated or in which they have a financial interest.” DOE Manual IV-7. \n82.  To identify and prevent conflicts of interest, “[p]rior to becoming advisory \ncommittee members,” DOE requires individuals to “disclose in writing (by annually filing either \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 25 of 40\n \nan SF 278, Public Financial Disclosure Report, OGE 450, Confidential Financial Disclosure \nReport, or an alternate Executive Branch Confidential Financial Disclosure Report with the \nOffice of the Assistant General Counsel for General Law) any financial or other interest that may \nbe affected by the work of the committee or create the appearance of a conflict of interest.” Id.  \nDefendants Have Violated and Are Violating FACA  \n83.  The Climate Working Group satisfies all of the elements of being an “advisory \ncommittee” within the meaning of FACA. DOE established the group to provide advice and \nrecommendations to DOE and EPA, and EPA has already utilized the CWG Report in EPA’s \nproposed reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and vehicle regulations. The \nClimate Working Group has an organized structure, a fixed membership, and a specific purpose \nthat Secretary Wright laid out in his Foreword to the CGW Report—“to critically review the \ncurrent state of climate science, with a focus on how it relates to the United States.” CWG \nReport at viii.   \n84.  Yet Defendants have not complied with any of FACA’s procedural and \nsubstantive requirements. Secretary Wright did not consult with GSA before establishing the \ngroup. The Climate Working Group lacks a charter and a designated federal officer. Secretary \nWright did not provide a Membership Balance Plan to GSA, and DOE did not conduct the \noutreach to different communities and stakeholders that the regulations require when selecting \ncommittee members.  \n85.  The Climate Working Group is not fairly balanced in terms of points of view; \nmost glaringly, it does not include a single member that concurs in the overwhelming scientific \nconsensus regarding the causes and effects of climate change. The group also lacks balance in \nterms of representing a range of disciplines, perspectives, and institutions. There are also no \nprovisions in place to prevent inappropriate influence of the group, and the group has been \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 26 of 40\n \ninappropriately influenced by being tasked with preparing a report that had a predetermined goal \nand outcome.  \n86.  Defendants have also violated all of FACA’s transparency requirements. \nDefendants did not publish notice of the Climate Working Group’s meetings and did not make \nthe meetings open to the public. Defendants did not even disclose the existence of the group until \nreleasing its reports.  \n87.  Defendants have not made public any of the records and other documents that the \nClimate Working Group must make public under Section 10(b) of FACA. Defendants likewise \nhave not kept or made public minutes of the Climate Working Group’s meetings. \n88.  In short, Defendants’ establishment and utilization of the Climate Working Group \nis wholly inconsistent with the processes, transparency, and public input that must be followed \nby federal advisory committees under federal law.  \nDefendants’ Legal Violations Harm Plaintiffs \n89.  Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists have strong \ninterests in the work of the Climate Working Group and have suffered concrete injuries from \nDefendants’ violations of FACA. EDF is dedicated to protecting human health and the \nenvironment, and its mission is to secure a vital earth for everyone. EDF employs hundreds of \nscientists, economists, policy analysts, engineers, business school graduates, lawyers, and other \nprofessionals to help solve public health and environmental problems and to educate \npolicymakers and the public on the causes and effects of climate change. The Climate and \nEnergy Group at UCS is likewise made up of approximately seventy scientists, analysts, \nengineers, organizers, and advocates, working together to prevent the worst impacts of climate \nchange. The program works on a range of related issues, including climate science, impacts, \nresilience, clean energy, and pushing back against disinformation on science and solutions. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 27 of 40\n \n90.  EDF’s work critically depends on access to information regarding governmental \nresearch and actions—including assessments of the causes, harms, and solutions regarding \nclimate change, and details of the processes and participants that contribute to such assessments. \nAccess to this information is necessary so that EDF can understand and evaluate the information \non which federal climate policy is based, and provide information from its own experts and \nresearch to help inform public policy. EDF seeks to ensure that government actions and policies \nare grounded in rigorous scientific findings. \n91.  UCS seeks to ensure that the views of the scientific community are represented in \ngovernment and has a distinct interest in ensuring that the advice given to DOE and the EPA by \nfederal advisory committees fairly reflects the experience and expertise of UCS members and the \nscientific community as a whole. Further, UCS works to support the transparency and public \nparticipation elements of the federal advisory committee process as a vital form of public \nparticipation and engagement with evidence-based policymaking. UCS has long advocated for \nfairly balanced advisory committees, their regular meetings and adherence to their charters, and \navoidance of conflicts of interest in advisory committee membership. UCS has also nominated \nstaff and members for participation on federal advisory committees, submitted written \ncomments, delivered oral comments, and advocated for independent science advisory bodies. \n92.  UCS scientists and experts work to help ensure that the best available climate \nscience is used to inform policies to protect communities from the impacts of climate change and \nlimit the heat-trapping emissions driving climate change. UCS staff have contributed to the \nNational Climate Assessments and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. UCS has a \nstrong interest in being confident of high standards of transparency, peer review, and scientific \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 28 of 40\n \nintegrity for the credibility of climate assessment reports that federal agencies rely on for \npolicymaking.   \n93.  Access to information concerning the government’s assessment of climate \nscience, and the underlying scientific information and advice upon which the government relies, \nis central to EDF’s and UCS’s missions.  \n94.  Plaintiffs have suffered informational injuries from Defendants’ failures to file a \ncharter for the Climate Working Group, to designate a federal officer, to provide timely notice of \nand public access to its meetings, and to make the group’s records publicly available. Plaintiffs \nhave a statutory right to information about the formation, operations, and decisions of the \nClimate Working Group, since it is an advisory committee subject to FACA, and Defendants \nhave failed to provide this information. Plaintiffs would have attended the Climate Working \nGroup’s meetings had they been made open to the public as required, and Plaintiffs will attend \nthe group’s future meetings if open to the public. Plaintiffs would have participated in group \nmeetings as members of the public, as provided for by FACA. Plaintiffs likewise would review \nthe group’s records that FACA requires to be disclosed.  \n95.  Plaintiffs intend to submit comments to DOE on the CWG Report and to EPA on \nits proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding and vehicle emission standards, and to \nparticipate in the EPA public hearings on the rescindment proposal. Plaintiffs also intend to \neducate the public on the report and the proposed rule. Access to information about the Climate \nWorking Group’s records and meetings would significantly inform EDF’s and UCS’s comments \nand public education efforts. Lack of access to such information impedes Plaintiffs’ ability to \ncomment on the CWG Report and EPA proposal, and to inform the public about the extent of \nthese government actions that are based on the report.  \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 29 of 40\n \n96.  Plaintiffs and UCS’s members are also injured by the Climate Working Group’s \nlack of fair balance and inappropriate influence. Defendants have denied Plaintiffs a \nrepresentative voice on the group. Instead, the group’s members also hold viewpoints that are \ncontrary to the scientific consensus on climate change, and the group was given a mandate to \nreach a predetermined outcome. The CWG Report would have been materially different if the \ngroup had included members sharing the same viewpoint as Plaintiffs.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nUnlawful Establishment and Utilization of a Federal Advisory Committee \nAPA Cause of Action \n \n97.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of the \nComplaint as if set forth herein. \n98.  Defendants’ establishment and utilization of the Climate Working Group are final \nagency actions subject to review under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \n99.  The Climate Working Group is an advisory committee within the meaning of \nFACA because it is a group established by DOE to obtain advice or recommendations to the \nfederal government, and has been utilized and will continue to be utilized by DOE and EPA. 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 1001(2)(A)(iii). The group is not composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-\ntime, officers or employees of the Federal Government, and is not a committee that is created by \nthe National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration. Id. § \n1001(2)(A). \n100.  The Climate Working Group has an organized structure, fixed membership, and \nspecific purpose. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 30 of 40\n \n101.  Defendants DOE and Secretary Wright have failed to take the steps that FACA, \nits implementing regulations, and the DOE Manual require in establishing an advisory \ncommittee, including but not limited to: \na.  Consulting with the Secretariat about the establishment of the Climate \nWorking Group and providing the Secretariat with a full understanding of the \nbackground and purpose behind the advisory committee, 41 C.F.R. § 102-\n3.60(b)(1);  \nb.  Providing an explanation as to “why the [Climate Working Group] is essential \nto the conduct of agency business and in the public interest” and “why the \nadvisory committee’s functions cannot be performed by the agency, another \nexisting committee, or other means such as a public hearing,” id. § 102-\n3.60(b)(2); \nc.  Publishing a notice in the Federal Register announcing the creation of the \nClimate Working Group as an advisory committee, id. § 102-3.65(a); \nd.  Filing a charter for the Climate Working Group, or otherwise publishing the \ninformation required for a charter under 5 U.S.C. § 1008(c)(2), see id. § \n1008(c)(1)-(2); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.70;  \ne.  Designating a federal officer “to chair or attend each meeting of [the] advisory \ncommittee,” 5 U.S.C. § 1009(e); see also 41 C.F.R. § 102–3.120;  \nf.  Submitting a Membership Balance Plan to GSA describing DOE’s “plan to \nattain fairly balanced membership,” which “shall describe the agency’s \nconclusions regarding the points of view that would promote fairly balanced \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 31 of 40\n \ncommittee membership” and “shall describe the agency’s intended outreach \nefforts to accomplish these goals,” 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.60(b)(3); \ng.  “Conduct[ing] broad outreach, using a variety of means and methods, to \nensure that the call for nominees reaches the interested parties and stakeholder \ngroups likely to possess [the] points of view” that would promote fairly \nbalanced membership, id. § 102-3.60(b)(3)(ii); \nh.  Giving consideration in choosing members “to factors such as the geographic \nregion of the country; minority groups; women’s organizations; public and \nprivate academic institutions, including Black colleges and universities; \nphysically challenged individuals and groups; and the public at large,” DOE \nManual at 37; \ni.  Making appropriate provisions “to assure that the advice and \nrecommendations of the advisory committee will not be inappropriately \ninfluenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest, but will \ninstead be the result of the advisory committee’s independent judgment,” 5 \nU.S.C. § 1004(b)(3);  \nj.  Designating “an Advisory Committee Management Officer” within DOE \n“who shall exercise control and supervision over the establishment, \nprocedures, and accomplishments of” the Climate Working Group, 5 U.S.C. § \n1007(b)(1). \n102.  Each “action” that the Climate Working Group took—including drafting and \nreleasing the CWG report—violates FACA because “[a]n advisory committee shall not . . . take \nany action until an advisory committee charter has been filed . . . with (i) the head of the agency \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 32 of 40\n \nto whom the advisory committee reports, and (ii) the standing committees of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over the agency to which the advisory \ncommittee reports.” 5 U.S.C. § 1008(c). \n103.  Defendants’ actions utilizing the Climate Working Group, including DOE’s \npublishing the CWG Report and EPA’s reliance on and citations to the CWG Report in its \nproposed rule, are unlawful because Defendants failed to comply with the requirements for \nutilizing an advisory committee, including but not limited to the requirements listed above and in \nthe subsequent counts.  \n104.  Defendants’ actions in establishing and utilizing the Climate Working Group are \narbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with law, in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, and without observance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C), \n(D). In addition or in the alternative, Defendants have unlawfully withheld or unreasonably \ndelayed agency actions under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nCOUNT TWO \nFailure to Comply with Meeting Requirements \nAPA Cause of Action \n105.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of the \nComplaint as if set forth herein. \n106.  Defendants’ planning and holding of Climate Working Group meetings, and \ninstructing and permitting the group to plan and hold meetings, are final agency actions subject \nto review under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n107.  Defendants have failed to comply with the requirements for advisory committee \nmeetings. \n108.  Defendants have violated FACA’s prohibition that “[a]n advisory committee shall \nnot meet . . . until an advisory committee charter has been filed” with the heads of the agencies to \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 33 of 40\n \nwhich the advisory committee reports and with the standing committees of Congress having \njurisdiction over those agencies. 5 U.S.C. § 1008(c). \n109.  Defendants have violated other requirements for advisory committee meetings, \nincluding but not limited to the requirements that meetings be: \na.  Open to the public. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(a); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.150(a).  \nb.  Noticed in the Federal Register at least fifteen days before the meeting. 5 \nU.S.C. § 1009(a); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.150(a). \nc.  Accessible for the public “to attend, appear before, or file statements.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 1009(a)(3).  \nd.  “[H]eld at a reasonable time and in a manner or place reasonably accessible to \nthe public,” and in a place sufficient to accommodate “a reasonable number of \ninterested members of the public.” 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.140(a)(1)-(2).  \n110.  Defendants’ actions in planning and holding Climate Working Group meetings, \nand instructing and permitting the group to plan and hold meetings, are arbitrary, capricious, not \nin accordance with law, in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, and without \nobservance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C), (D). In addition or in the \nalternative, Defendants have unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed agency actions under \n5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nCOUNT THREE \nFailure to Comply with Records Requirements  \nAPA Cause of Action \n111.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of the \nComplaint as if set forth herein. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 34 of 40\n \n112.  Defendants’ establishment, operation, and utilization of the Climate Working \nGroup, without complying or ensuring compliance with FACA’s records requirements, are final \nagency actions subject to review under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n113.  Defendants have failed to comply with FACA’s records requirements. \n114.  Defendants DOE and Wright have failed to “assemble and maintain the reports, \nrecords, and other papers of” the Climate Working Group, and to “carry out . . . the provisions of \nsection 552 of this title with respect to such reports, records, and other papers.” 5 U.S.C. § \n1007(b)(2)-(3). Defendant Wright has failed to designate a DOE official to undertake these \nduties. Id. \n115.  Defendants have failed to contemporaneously make available to the public, or \nensure that there is contemporaneously available to the public, “the records, reports, transcripts, \nminutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents which were \nmade available to or prepared for or by” the Climate Working Group. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(b); 41 \nC.F.R. § 102-3.170.  \n116.  Defendants have failed to keep and publicly post, or ensure that there is kept and \npublicly posted, the minutes of the Climate Working Group’s meetings, including “[a]n accurate \ndescription of each matter discussed” in each meeting. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(c); 41 C.F.R. § 102-\n3.165(b)-(c). \n117.  Defendants’ establishment, operation, and utilization of the Climate Working \nGroup, without complying or ensuring compliance with FACA’s records requirements, are \narbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with law, in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, and without observance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C), \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 35 of 40\n \n(D). In addition or in the alternative, Defendants have unlawfully withheld or unreasonably \ndelayed agency actions under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nCOUNT FOUR \nLack of Fair Balance and Failure to Prevent Inappropriate Influence  \nAPA Cause of Action \n118.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of the \nComplaint as if set forth herein. \n119.  FACA requires that an advisory committee be “fairly balanced in terms of the \npoints of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 1004(b)(2).  \n120.  As set forth above, the members of the Climate Working Group are not fairly \nbalanced in terms of their points of view on the issues addressed in the CWG Report. All five \nmembers hold views contrary to the overwhelming consensus of climate scientists, including on \nthe effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. None of the members represents the \nconsensus view among climate scientists that human activities—principally through greenhouse \ngas emissions—have unequivocally caused global warming, that widespread and rapid changes \nin the atmosphere have occurred that are already affecting weather and extreme climate events \nthroughout the globe, that climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health, \nand that deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a discernible slowdown in \nglobal warming that would reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems. \n121.  Moreover, the Climate Working Group has been “inappropriately influenced by \nthe appointing authority or by any special interest.” 5 U.S.C. § 1004(b)(3). Secretary Wright \ninappropriately influenced the group by establishing the CWG and specially selecting its \nmembers with a predetermined goal to provide “balance” against the “media coverage [that] \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 36 of 40\n \ndistorts the science” of climate change.39 Wright had a “plan” that the group write a report that \n“cut against the prevailing narrative that climate change is an existential threat,”40 rather than by \nrecruiting scientists to provide neutral and objective views on climate science.  \n122.  By violating FACA, Defendants have acted in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, not in accordance with law, in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, and without observance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C), \n(D). In addition or in the alternative, Defendants have unlawfully withheld or unreasonably \ndelayed agency actions under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nCOUNT FIVE \nNonstatutory Review and Ultra Vires Actions \n123.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of the \nComplaint as if set forth herein. \n124.  To the extent that relief is not available against Defendants under the foregoing \nCounts, the Court must enjoin Defendants’ ultra vires actions that are plainly “in excess of \n[Defendants’] delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the statute that is clear \nand mandatory.” Fed. Express Corp. v. Dep’t of Com., 39 F.4th 756, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \nDefendants’ actions are “clear departure[s]” from their “statutory mandate[s]” under FACA, and \nrepresent “blatantly lawless” agency actions. Id. at 764. \nCOUNT SIX \nMandamus \n125.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of the \nComplaint as if set forth herein. \n \n39 CWG Report at viii. \n40 Travis Fisher, Why I Helped Organize the Department of Energy’s Climate Report, CATO at Liberty (Aug. 6, \n2025, 10:25 AM), https://perma.cc/CQ87-WCYF. \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 37 of 40\n \n126.  The Court has authority over “any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an \nofficer or employee of the United States or an agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the \nplaintiff.” 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \n127.  The Climate Working Group is clearly obligated to comply with, and to be \nconstituted in accordance with, federal law, including FACA and its implementing regulations. \n128.  The Climate Working Group is clearly not in compliance with law because it has \nno charter, no federal officer has been designated, it lacks fair balance, is not adequately \nprotected from inappropriate influence, and has not complied with FACA’s transparency \nrequirements for holding meetings and maintaining and disclosing records. \n129.  Plaintiffs have no adequate alternative remedy against the Climate Working \nGroup and its members. \n130.  The Climate Working Group and its members are therefore subject to mandamus. \n131.  To the extent that relief is not available against Defendants other than the Climate \nWorking Group and its members under any of the foregoing Counts, mandamus is warranted to \ncompel such Defendants to comply with their clear legal duties under FACA and its \nimplementing regulations. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court  \nA.  Declare that the Climate Working Group is an advisory committee subject to \nFACA and all of its requirements;  \nB.  Declare unlawful the establishment and utilization of the Climate Working Group \nby Defendants DOE, EPA, Secretary Wright, and Administrator Zeldin;  \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 38 of 40\n \nC.  Declare that Defendants violated FACA by not complying with the requirements \nfor holding advisory committee meetings and maintaining and disclosing advisory committee \nrecords; \nD.  Declare that Defendants violated FACA because the Climate Working Group \ndoes not have a fairly balanced membership and was inappropriately influenced by the \nappointing authority or by any special interest; \nE.  Postpone the effective date of, and vacate, the establishment of the Climate \nWorking Group, including the selection and appointment of its members;  \nF.  Postpone the effective date of, and vacate, each action taken by the CWG, \nincluding the drafting and completion of the CWG Report and the transmission of the CWG \nReport to Defendants’ DOE, EPA, Secretary Wright, and Administrator Zeldin; \nG.  Postpone the effective date of, and vacate, Defendants’ actions utilizing the \nClimate Working Group, including DOE’s publishing the CWG Report and transmitting it to \nDefendants EPA and Administrator Zeldin, and EPA’s reliance on the CWG Report in its \nproposed rule to rescind the Endangerment Finding and the vehicle emissions standards; \nH.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Climate Working Group from meeting, \nadvising Defendants or any other federal officials or agencies, or otherwise conducting Climate \nWorking Group business, and enjoin Defendants DOE, EPA, Secretary Wright, and \nAdministrator Zeldin from facilitating any meetings or business of the Climate Working Group \nand receiving advice from the group or its members, unless and until Defendants comply with all \nrequirements for the group to operate legally as an advisory committee;   \nI.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin or compel Defendants to immediately \ndisclose all records and minutes required to be disclosed under 5 U.S.C. §§ 1009(b)-(c), and to \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 1     Filed 08/12/25     Page 39 of 40\n \nproduce a Vaughn index for any materials related to the Climate Working Group in any way that \nare withheld from disclosure for any reason;  \nJ.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants DOE, EPA, Secretary Wright, \nand Administrator Zeldin from relying on or citing to the CWG Report and any other \nrecommendations, advice, or reports of the Climate Working Group, in any agency actions or \nproceedings; \nK.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the current deadlines for public comments \non the CWG Report and the EPA NPRM to rescind the Endangerment Finding and the vehicle \nemissions standards until the statutory violations described above are remedied; \nL.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants EPA and Zeldin to maintain a \npublic comment period on the proposed rescissions of the Endangerment Finding and vehicle \nemissions standards for at least 45 days from the date that Defendants release all records and \nminutes required to be disclosed under 5 U.S.C. §§ 1009(b)-(c); \nM.

Secretary of Energy Christopher Wright has \nstated that he “commissioned” the group, “select[ed]” its members, and endowed it with specific \npurposes. Robinson Decl. Ex. A (CWG Report) at viii. The group then jointly authored a report \nthat provides direct advice and recommendations to federal policymakers, including on the \n“approach . . . it is essential” to take, the “realistic assumptions” that “it will be important to \nmake,” and the factors that “must be weighed” in setting climate policy. Id. at 130. The group’s \nmembers are not full-time or permanent part-time federal employees. The CWG is clearly an \nadvisory committee. \n  Once that is established, there is no dispute that Defendants violated all of FACA’s \nrequirements. They did not publicize the group’s creation, did not comply with the procedural \nand substantive requirements for ensuring fairly balanced membership, and failed to make the \ngroup’s records and meetings available to the public. The establishment of the CWG, and “any \naction” it has taken, is therefore unlawful. 5 U.S.C. § 1005(c)(1).    \n  Plaintiffs file this motion to bring an immediate end to the lawless operation of and \nreliance on the CWG, before it is too late to repair the enormous harm being caused to Plaintiffs \nand their members. The relief entered must meet the brazenness of the legal violations and the \nimpact they will cause. Plaintiffs request that the Court preliminarily enjoin, and postpone under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Defendants’ unlawful actions in establishing, \noperating, and utilizing the CWG. Plaintiffs further request that the Court order Defendants to \ndisclose all records that FACA requires to be disclosed, to cease any meetings of the CWG, and \n   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 6 of 25\nto cease operations of the group entirely unless and until Defendants comply with the law. In the \nalternative, because Defendants’ own words and the statutory text resolve this case, there is no \nmaterially disputed fact and the Court may enter summary judgment.  \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The Federal Advisory Committee Act \n“Congress enacted FACA in substantial part to provide uniform standards for the \ncreation, operation, and management of advisory committees.” Union of Concerned Scientists v. \nWheeler, 954 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2020) (citation omitted). FACA imposes “a statutory duty to \nensure transparency and a balanced membership in forming advisory committees.” Nat’l Ass’n of \nConsumer Advocs. v. Uejio, 521 F. Supp. 3d 130, 135 (D. Mass. 2021). When Congress enacted \nFACA, one of the principal concerns was that “special interest groups may use their membership \non [advisory committees] to promote their private concerns.” H.R. Rep. No. 92-1017, at 6 \n(1972), as reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3491, 3496. \nFACA and its implementing regulations impose clear requirements on an agency seeking \nto establish an advisory committee. An agency must consult with the General Services \nAdministration (GSA) and justify the need for the committee. 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.60(a). The \nagency must publish notice of a committee’s establishment in the Federal Register, and must file \na charter containing specific information. 5 U.S.C. § 1008(a)(2), (c); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.65. “An \nadvisory committee shall not meet or take any action until an advisory committee charter has \nbeen filed.” 5 U.S.C. § 1008(c)(1). Agencies must also appoint a designated federal officer and \nan Advisory Committee Officer Manager to attend each meeting and oversee the committee’s \noperations. Id. §§ 1007(b)(1), 1009(e).  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 7 of 25\nFACA also imposes procedural and substantive requirements for selecting committee \nmembers. Substantively, committee membership must be “fairly balanced in terms of the points \nof view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 1004(b)(2). The agency forming a committee also must make “appropriate provisions to assure \nthat the advice and recommendations of the advisory committee will not be inappropriately \ninfluenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest.” Id. § 1004(b)(3). The agency \nmust follow specific procedural steps in furtherance of these substantive requirements, including \nproviding GSA a “Membership Balance Plan” on how it will meet these requirements, and must \n“conduct broad outreach” in soliciting applicants to be members. 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.60(b)(3). \nOnce a committee is established and begins its work, FACA imposes significant \ntransparency requirements on the committee’s operations. With limited exceptions, all \n“meetings” of the advisory committee members must be open to the public. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(a). \nFACA imposes open records requirements as well, requiring that “the records, reports, \ntranscripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents \nwhich were made available to or prepared for or by each advisory committee shall be available” \nto the public, subject only to limited exceptions. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(b). \nB.  The Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 Endangerment Finding  \nIn 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the “Endangerment \nFinding,” a determination that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare of current \nand future generations, and with it a determination that emissions from motor vehicles and \nengines contribute to the greenhouse gas pollution that threatens public health and welfare. See \n74 Fed. Reg. 66,496 (Dec. 15, 2009).  \nThe Endangerment Finding rests on a vast body of scientific evidence and extensive \npublic engagement. Id. at 66,517-18, 66,524, 66,531. EPA issued the finding following a lengthy \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 8 of 25\nevaluation process that involved several rounds of public input—including over 380,000 \ncomments, two public hearings, and an exhaustive investigation of rigorous, peer-reviewed \nscientific research. Id. at 66,500, 66,510. Since its issuance in 2009, the Endangerment Finding \nhas provided support for various EPA actions to limit climate pollution from the largest emitters: \ncoal- and gas-fired power plants, new passenger cars and trucks, medium and heavy-duty freight \ntrucks and buses, and the oil and gas industry. See, e.g., 75 Fed. Reg. 25,324 (May 7, 2010).  \nOn his first day in office, the President signed an executive order directing the EPA \nAdministrator to work with other agency heads to submit recommendations on the “legality and \ncontinuing applicability” of the Endangerment Finding. See Executive Order 14154, Unleashing \nAmerican Energy, § 6(f). In March 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced EPA’s \nintention to reconsider the Endangerment Finding.  \nAccording to records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), on \nFebruary 13, 2025, Dr. Koonin—a future member of the CWG—emailed Administrator Zeldin’s \nChief of Staff to “offer technical assistance from me and colleagues in the review of the \nEndangerment Finding.” Robinson Decl. Ex. L. \nC.  The Department of Energy Establishes the Climate Working Group  \nIn March 2025, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright decided to convene a “climate working \ngroup.” Robinson Decl. Ex. B (8/6/25 Fisher Blog). The group’s express mandate was to issue a \nreport that would “challenge the mainstream consensus,” CWG Report at x, and “cut against the \nprevailing narrative that climate change is an existential threat,” see 8/6/25 Fisher Blog. The \ngroup’s existence was not publicly disclosed until July 29, 2025, the same day EPA released its \nnotice of proposed rulemaking to rescind the Endangerment Finding. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 9 of 25\nSecretary Wright hand-picked the five individual members of the working group: Drs. \nJohn Christy, Judith Curry, Steven Koonin, Ross McKitrick, and Roy Spencer. All five have a \nhistory of questioning the impacts of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions on climate \nchange, and have asserted that the costs of climate change mitigation exceed the benefits. Dilling \nDecl. ¶ 20; Ekwurzel Decl. ¶ 6. For example, Dr. Christy has written that he “see[s] neither the \ndeveloping catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of \nthe warming we see,” a view that he acknowledged was out of step with a “majority” of his \nclimate scientist colleagues. Robinson Decl. Ex. C (Christy Op-ed). Dr. Spencer has stated that \nclimate change is not a “crisis” and that “nothing we see in severe weather has been tied to \nhuman greenhouse gas emissions.” Robinson Decl. Ex. D (Spencer Blog). The other members \nlikewise are known for their “contrarian views on climate science that are out of step with the \nmainstream.” Robinson Decl. Ex. E (Science Article).  \nIt is indisputable that the Department of Energy (DOE) and Secretary Wright did not \nfollow any of FACA’s requirements in forming the CWG. \nD.  The Climate Working Group Prepares Its Report \nIn April 2025, the CWG began preparing its report. The group completed its work in \nunder two months, working in secret without holding any public meetings or soliciting public \ninput. The group submitted a draft report to Secretary Wright on May 27, 2025, and the report \nwas contemporaneously sent to EPA. See 90 Fed. Reg. at 36,292. \nOn July 29, 2025, DOE published the CWG Report, titled A Critical Review of Impacts of \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate. Secretary Wright wrote a foreword stating that \nhe confirmed that he “commissioned this report” to “provide clarity and balance,” because the \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 10 of 25\n“media coverage often distorts the science” of climate change. CWG Report at viii. Although the \nreport is labeled a draft, Wright concluded that “it faithfully reports the state of climate science \ntoday.” Id. \nThe CWG Report bears DOE’s official seal, but the Preface explains that there was “no \neditorial oversight by the Secretary, the Department of Energy, or any other government \npersonnel.” Id. at x. Dr. Curry stated that “each CWG author . . . approved this document on a \nline-by-line basis.” Robinson Decl. Ex. F (Curry Blog). She added that “[t]he CWG expects to \nexpend considerable time responding to the comments that are submitted on the draft report,” \nand presumably “will be charged with writing a revised, more comprehensive report that \nresponds to the external comments.” Id. \nIn the CWG Report, the authors explain that DOE commissioned the report to advise the \nfederal government on “climate science relevant for energy policymaking.” CWG Report at x. \nCarrying out this mandate, the body of the report advises policymakers on a number of issues; \nfor example, that the economic effects of carbon-dioxide-induced warming “are too small to \njustify aggressive abatement policy and that trying to ‘stop’ or cap global warming . . . would be \nworse than doing nothing.” Id. at 116. The report’s “Concluding thoughts” provides direct advice \nand recommendations to federal policymakers, including on the type of “approach for informing \nclimate policy” that should be taken, the factors that “must be weighed” in setting policy, why “it \nis important” to make certain “realistic assumptions,” and that “it is essential” for policymakers \nto “acknowledge[] both the potential risks and benefits of CO .” Id. at 130.  \n2\nClimate scientists immediately denounced the report and objected that it mischaracterized \ntheir research, including UCS board member Ben Santer, who stated that the report \n“fundamentally misrepresents” his work. Robinson Decl. Ex. G. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 11 of 25\nOn August 1, 2025, DOE published a “Notice of Availability” of the report and has \nallowed members of the public only thirty-two days to provide comments. 90 Fed. Reg. 36,150. \nThe comment period will close on September 2, 2025. Id. \nE.  EPA Relies on the CWG Reports for Its Proposed Rescissions  \nOn July 29, 2025, EPA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind the \nEndangerment Finding and all light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle and engine greenhouse \ngas emission standards. See 90 Fed. Reg. 36,288 (Aug. 1, 2025). In the preamble, EPA states that \nit “reviewed and relied upon” the CWG Report “in formulating” its proposal. See 90 Fed. Reg. at \n36,292. The proposed rule further states that the EPA Administrator personally “received and \nevaluated the draft report submitted by the [CWG].” Id. \nEPA relies on the CWG Report extensively throughout the proposed rule, citing it 22 \ntimes. EPA relies upon the report for each of the central assertions in EPA’s “Climate Science \nDiscussion,” including that: “reducing GHG emissions from all vehicles and engines in the \nUnited States to zero would not have a scientifically measurable impact on GHG emission \nconcentrations or global warming potential”; “extreme weather events have not demonstrably \nincreased relative to historical highs”; the models that the Endangerment Finding relied upon \n“may be based on inaccurate assumptions”; and “increases in CO  concentrations have \n2\nsubstantial beneficial impacts on plant growth and agricultural productivity, and . . . this benefit \nhas been significantly greater than previously believed.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 36,307–10. Public \nhearings on EPA’s proposal are scheduled for August 19, 20, and 21, and comments are due on \nSeptember 22. See EPA, Extension of Public Comment Period, https://perma.cc/3HSS-Z7QK.  \nF.  Procedural History \n  Plaintiffs Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) \nfiled a complaint in this action on August 12, 2025. EDF is a nonprofit membership organization \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 12 of 25\ndedicated to protecting human health and the environment. Dilling Decl. ¶ 3. UCS represents the \ninterests of the scientific community in public policy and advocates for the role of scientists in \nfederal policymaking. Ekwurzel Decl.  ¶ 3 Plaintiffs and their members have strong interests in \nthe work of the CWG, and they intend to submit comments on the CWG Report and EPA’s \nproposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding. Dilling Decl. ¶ 22-27; Ekwurzel Decl. ¶ 6; \nBrock Decl. ¶ 8-10. Plaintiffs now move for a preliminary injunction and stay, or, in the \nalternative for summary judgment. \nARGUMENT \n  In evaluating a request for preliminary relief, the “district court must consider the \nmovant’s likelihood of success on the merits; whether and to what extent the movant will suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief; the balance of relative \nhardships . . . ; and . . . the public interest.” US Ghost Adventures, LLC v. Miss Lizzie’s Coffee \nLLC, 121 F.4th 339, 347 (1st Cir. 2024) (cleaned up).  All of these factors favor Plaintiffs here. \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \n  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits because the CWG is a federal advisory \ncommittee, and Defendants did not comply with FACA’s requirements for such committees.  \nA. The CWG Is a Federal Advisory Committee \n1.  The CWG Meets the Statutory Definition of an Advisory Committee \nThe CWG meets the statutory criteria for being an “advisory committee.” The CWG is a \n“group . . . established or utilized to obtain advice or recommendations for . . .  or one or more \nagencies or officers of the Federal Government,” was “established or utilized by one or more \nagencies,” and is not “composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or \nemployees of the Federal Government.” 5 U.S.C. § 1001(2).   \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 13 of 25\n First, DOE “established” the CWG. Secretary Wright made this clear in the Foreword to \nthe CWG Report, writing: “I commissioned this report.” CWG Report at viii. He added: “I asked \na diverse team of independent experts to critically review the current state of climate science, \nwith a focus on how it relates to the United States.” CWG Report at viii. CWG member Roy \nSpencer confirmed that Wright personally called and asked him to participate, and that Wright \n“had on his list” other eventual members of the group. Robinson Decl. Ex. D (Spencer Blog). \nMember Judith Curry also confirmed that Wright personally invited her to join. Id. Ex. H \n(StorrowArticle). Wright not only “chose” the CWG’s members, CWG Report at viii, but also \nrecruited Travis Fisher from the Cato Institute to come to DOE on a detail to “organize” the \ngroup and “coordinate” its activities. Id. Ex. I (Fisher LinkedIn). By commissioning the group, \npicking its members, assigning it a core task, and organizing and coordinating its activities, DOE \nclearly “established” the CWG.1 SeeHeartwood, Inc. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 431 F. Supp. 2d 28 \n \n(D.D.C. 2006). \nSecond, the CWG was “established or utilized to obtain advice or recommendations for” \nDOE and EPA. Secretary Wright stated in the Foreword that he assembled the CWG to advise \nhim and other policymakers on “the current state of climate science, with a focus on how it \nrelates to the United States.” CWG Report at viii. The CWG members likewise understood that \nthe report would advise the federal government on “climate science relevant to energy \npolicymaking.” Id. at ix. Carrying out this mandate, the CWG Report is replete with advice and \nrecommendations for federal policymakers. For example, on specific modeling issues, the report \nrecommends that agencies, “account for the uncertainty” in the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity \n \n1 It suffices that DOE clearly established the CWG, but DOE and EPA also “utilized” the CWG in assigning it a \nspecific task and managing its work, which DOE and EPA intended to use and did use for official purposes, \nincluding to justify the Endangerment Finding rescission. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 14 of 25\nwhen “policy making,” advises that data from the Atlantic basin “is most relevant to U.S. \npolicymakers,” and suggests that estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon are “too variable to be \nuseful for policymakers.” Id. at 25, 48, 125. The report also contains broader advice, including \nthat the economic effects of carbon-dioxide induced warming “are too small to justify aggressive \nabatement policy and . . . trying to ‘stop’ or cap global warming even at levels well above the \nParis target would be worse than doing nothing.” Id. at 116. \nThe “Concluding thoughts” to the CWG Report then provide direct advice and \nrecommendations to agencies on climate regulations and policymaking. It states:  \nThis report supports a more nuanced and evidence-based approach for informing climate \npolicy that explicitly acknowledges uncertainties. The risks and benefits of a climate \nchanging under both natural and human influences must be weighed against the costs, \nefficacy, and collateral impacts of any “climate action”, considering the nation’s need \nfor reliable and affordable energy with minimal local pollution. . . . An approach that \nacknowledges both the potential risks and benefits of CO , rather than relying on flawed \n2\nmodels and extreme scenarios, is essential for informed and effective decision-making. \n \nId. at 130. This passage leaves no doubt that the CWG provided “advice or recommendations for \n. . .  one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government.” 5 U.S.C. § 1001(2)(A).  \n  Finally, the CWG is not “composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers \nor employees of the Federal Government.” 5 U.S.C. § 1001(2)(B)(i). There is no indication that \nany of the five committee members held a position with the federal government at the time the \nCWG began its work. And there is no indication that Drs. Curry or McKitrick have held any \nposition or title within the federal government since the CWG Report was convened, which \nalone means this FACA exception could not apply.  \nAs for the other members, it was reported in July that Drs. Koonin, Christy, and Spencer \nwere listed in DOE’s internal registry as a “special government employee,” an “expert,” and a \n“consultant,” respectively. Robinson Decl. Exs. J (E&E Article); K (CNN Article). But none of \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 15 of 25\nthose positions are “full-time” or “permanent part-time” positions. By law, “experts and \nconsultants” are “procured by contract” for “temporary (not in excess of 1 year) or intermittent \nservices,” and their hiring and pay are not governed by the provisions applicable to federal \nemployees. 5 U.S.C. § 202. Special government employees must end their roles once they have \nworked for 135 days. 18 U.S.C. § 202. Indeed, by default at DOE and across the government, \nadvisory committee members serve as special government employees, because that is not a full-\ntime or permanent part-time role. Robinson Decl. Ex. M at II-III (DOE, Advisory Committee \nManagement Program Manual); Office of Government Ethics, Memorandum to Designated \nAgency Ethics Officials (July 19, 2004). \n2.  The CWG Meets the Multi-Part Test Other Circuits Have Applied  \n  Some courts outside of this Circuit have applied a separate multi-part test for determining \nwhether a group qualifies as an advisory committee. That test asks whether an advisory group \nhas, “in large measure, an organized structure, a fixed membership, and a specific purpose.” \nVoteVets Action Fund v. U.S. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 992 F.3d 1097 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (quotations \nomitted). Some courts have added a fourth requirement that “the group must also render advice \nor recommendations, as a group, and not as a collection of individuals.” Am. First Legal Found. \nv. Cardona, 630 F. Supp. 3d 170, 177 (D.D.C. 2022) (quotations omitted). This Court is not \nbound to apply that test. But regardless, the CWG meets all of those criteria as well. \n  The CWG has an organized structure. “The ‘organized structure’ requirement is not a \nhigh bar to clear.” Cardona, 630 F. Supp. 3d at 181. In VoteVets, the D.C. Circuit found this \nrequirement met for three individuals advising the Department of Veterans Affairs, even where \nthey had no formal name and the agency did not organize them as a discrete group, where the \nindividuals referred to themselves as a “unit” or a “team.” 992 F.3d at 1105. Here, by contrast, \nDOE “assembled” the members into a group, gave the group the official name of the “Climate \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 16 of 25\nWorking Group,” and tasked it with writing a report on specific topics by a specific deadline of \nMay 28. CWG Report at x. The group thus had an organized structure.  \n  The group has a “fixed membership”: the CWG is and has always been composed of Drs. \nChristy, Curry, Koonin, McKitrick, and Spencer. \n  The group has a specific purpose. In the group’s own words, its task was “to write a \nreport on issues in climate science relevant for energy policymaking, including evidence and \nperspectives that challenge the mainstream consensus,” CWG Report at x, or, as Secretary \nWright put it, “to critically review the current state of climate science, with a focus on how it \nrelates to the United States.” Id. at viii. “The ‘specific purpose’ requirement, like the ‘organized \nstructure’ requirement, is not a high bar to clear,” and the CWG’s assigned charge easily clears \nit. Cardona, 630 F. Supp. 3d at 183; see also VoteVets, 992 F.3d at 1105. \n  Finally, the CWG rendered its advice “as a group.” Cardona, 630 F. Supp. 3d at 177. The \n“Climate Working Group” is the listed author of the CWG Report, and the authors refer to \nthemselves in the Preface as “[t]he writing team.” CWG Report iii, x. No portion is attributed to \nindividual members; every section represents the group’s collective product. \nB.  Defendants Violated FACA’s Requirements for Establishing and Utilizing \nAdvisory Committees \nBecause Defendants did not comply with any of FACA’s requirements, the merits of this \ncase should be uncontested if the Court concludes that the CWG is as an advisory committee.  \nTo name just some of FACA’s requirements that Defendants did not follow for \nestablishing and utilizing an advisory committee, DOE did not:  \n●  Consult with GSA and provide an explanation on why the group was “essential to the \nconduct of agency business and in the public interest” and why its “functions cannot \nbe performed by the agency,” 41 C.F.R. §§ 102-3.60(b)(1)-(2); \n●  Publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the CWG, id. § 102-3.65(a); \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 17 of 25\n●  File a charter for the CWG containing certain required information, 5 U.S.C. § \n1008(c)(2), see id. § 1008(c)(1)-(2); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.70; \n●  Designate a federal officer “to chair or attend each meeting of [the] advisory \ncommittee,” 5 U.S.C. § 1009(e); see also 41 C.F.R. § 102–3.120; \n●  Submit a Membership Balance Plan to GSA describing DOE’s “plan to attain fairly \nbalanced membership,” 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.60(b)(3); \n●  “Conduct broad outreach, using a variety of means and methods,” to “the interested \nparties and stakeholder groups likely to possess [the] points of view” needed for fairly \nbalanced membership, id. § 102-3.60(b)(3)(ii); or \n●  Designate “an Advisory Committee Management Officer” within DOE “who shall \nexercise control and supervision over the establishment, procedures, and \naccomplishments of” the Climate Working Group, 5 U.S.C. § 1007(b)(1). \n  Each of these violations is actionable and warrants relief. See, e.g., NAACP Legal Def. & \nEduc. Fund, Inc. v. Barr, 496 F. Supp. 3d 116, 143–44 (D.D.C. 2020); W. Org. of Res. Councils \nv. Bernhardt, 412 F. Supp. 3d 1227, 1236–37 (D. Mont. 2019). \nThe failure to file and publish a charter in particular carries significant legal \nconsequences. Congress provided that “[a]n advisory committee shall not meet or take any \naction until an advisory committee charter has been filed . . . with (i) the head of the agency to \nwhom the advisory committee reports, and (ii) the standing committees of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over the agency to which the advisory \ncommittee reports.” 5 U.S.C. § 1008(c) (emphasis added). Thus, every action the CWG has \ntaken—including drafting the report, transmitting it or causing it to be transmitted to EPA, and \npublishing it—has been unlawful. And every future action it takes will be illegal, unless and until \nthe group is reestablished and reconstituted in accordance with FACA’s requirements. \nC.  Defendants Violated FACA’s Meeting Requirements  \n  Defendants also did not comply with FACA’s open meetings requirements, which are \nessential to FACA’s transparency aims. The CWG lacked authority to meet at all given no \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 18 of 25\ncharter was filed. 5 U.S.C. § 1008(c). That aside, Defendants failed to provide notice of meetings \nin the Federal Register and did not allow the public “to attend, appear before, or file statements” \nat the meetings. Id. § 1009(a)(2)-1(3); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.150(a). Plaintiffs and the broader public \nhad no way to know that the CWG even existed, let alone when it was meeting. \nD.  Defendants Violated FACA’s Records Requirements \nDefendants’ violations of FACA’s records requirements are equally straightforward. \n“[U]nder section 10(b) of FACA, an agency is generally obligated to make available for public \ninspection and copying all materials that were made available to or prepared for or by an \nadvisory committee.” Food Chem. News v. HHS, 980 F.2d 1468, 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1992) \n(emphasis added). That includes all “records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working \npapers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents which were made available to or prepared for \nor by” the committee. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(b). In addition, minutes from every committee meeting \nmust be disclosed, which must include “[a]n accurate description of each matter discussed” in \neach meeting. Id. § 1009(c); 41 C.F.R. § 102-3.165(b)-(c). \nAs the agency that established the CWG, DOE must “assemble and maintain” all of these \nmaterials. 5 U.S.C. § 1007(b)(2)-(3). And Section 10(b) “affirmatively obligates [DOE] to \nprovide access to the identified materials”—proactively—“even in the absence of a particular \nrequest.” Cummock v. Gore, 180 F.3d 282, 289 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Agencies cannot delay this \nduty; they must ensure “contemporaneous availability of advisory committee records.” 41 C.F.R. \n§ 102-3.170. (emphasis added). And they may not withhold FACA materials based on the \ndeliberative process privilege. Heartwood, Inc. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 431 F. Supp. 2d 28, 36 \n(D.D.C. 2006). \nHere, DOE had a duty to affirmatively disclose all CWG records falling under Section \n10(b). This duty encompasses, at a minimum, all emails, draft documents, and other written \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 19 of 25\nmaterials shared among the full group of five members. Such materials were “made available to \nor prepared for or by” the CWG. 5 U.S.C. § 1009(b). Defendants also must disclose any record \nprepared or received by a group member “if it was created or obtained with the intent to disclose \nit to the advisory committee.” Order at 2, Lawyers’ Comm. for Civil Rights under Law v. Pres. \nComm’n on Elec. Integrity, No. 17-cv-01354, ECF No. 28 (D.D.C. Aug. 30, 2017). \nE.  Defendants Violated FACA’s Fair Balance and Influence Requirements  \n \nFACA “requires [an agency] to maintain a fair balance on its committees and to avoid \ninappropriate influences by both the appointing authority and any special interest.” Union of \nConcerned Scientists, 954 F.3d at 20. These requirements are justiciable. Id. at 19.   \nThere can be no question that the CWG—which was formed for the express purpose of \n“challeng[ing] the mainstream consensus” on climate science, CWG Report at x—violates \nFACA’s fair balance requirement. Most glaringly, it does not include a single member that \nconcurs in the overwhelming scientific consensus regarding the causes and effects of climate \nchange. The group also lacks balance in terms of representing a range of disciplines and \nperspectives. DOE’s “deliberate and explicit effort to avoid the representation of any competing \nviewpoints on the subject matter of [the] advisory committee” is unlawful. NAACP, 496 F. Supp. \n3d at 143-44 (holding that advisory committee on improving law enforcement lacked fair \nbalance because all of its members were from “law enforcement,” and there were no members \nfrom civil rights groups, defense attorneys, or academics); see also Nw. Ecosystem All. v. Off. of \nU.S. Trade Representative, 1999 WL 33526001, at *7-8 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 9, 1999) (holding \nthat forest products advisory committees lacked fair balance because they consisted entirely of \nindustry representatives without any environmental representatives).  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 20 of 25\nDOE also violated FACA by failing to implement “appropriate provisions to assure that \nthe advice and recommendations of the advisory committee will not be inappropriately \ninfluenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest.” 5 U.S.C. § 1004(b)(3). DOE \nput no provisions in place to prevent inappropriate influence on the group, and Secretary Wright \ninappropriately influenced the group by specially tasking it with a predetermined goal to provide \n“balance” against the “media coverage [that] distorts the science” of climate change. CWG \nReport at viii. While there may be cases where a lack of fair balance or inappropriate influence \nare difficult to determine, “certainly this is not such a case.” NAACP, 496 F. Supp. 3d at 144. \nII.  Absent an Injunction, Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm  \n  Plaintiffs are suffering several types of irreparable harm. Plaintiffs and their members \nurgently need access to the CWG records to inform Plaintiffs’ comments on the CWG Report \n(due September 2) and the proposed rescissions of the Endangerment Finding and emissions \nregulations (due September 22). Dilling Decl. ¶¶ 22-27; Ekwurzel Decl. ¶ 6-7; Brock Decl. ¶¶ 8-\n10; see Nat’l Ass’n of Consumer Advocs. v. Uejio, 521 F. Supp. 3d 130, 142-43 (D. Mass. 2021). \nPlaintiffs also require this information to inform the public and advocate on behalf of their \nmembers on an “ongoing proceeding[] of national importance.” Ctr. for Pub. Integrity v. DOD, \n411 F. Supp. 3d 5, 12 (D.D.C. 2019); see Dilling Decl. ¶¶ 12, 26-27. Courts have repeatedly held \nthat the withholding of information in such contexts results in irreparable harm. See, e.g., id.; \nAm. Oversight v. Dep’t of State, 414 F. Supp. 3d 182, 186-87 (D.D.C. 2019) (finding irreparable \nharm where requested information related to ongoing impeachment proceedings); Washington \nPost v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 459 F. Supp. 2d 61, 75 (D.D.C. 2006) (same where information \nrequested related to “current national debate”). \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 21 of 25\n  Plaintiffs will also be irreparably harmed if the CWG keeps meeting without complying \nwith FACA’s open meetings requirements. Dr. Curry has stated that the CWG will keep working \nto respond to public comments, Robinson Decl. Ex. F, and Plaintiffs have the right to attend and \nparticipate in those meetings. If meetings continue to occur “behind closed doors,” Plaintiffs \n“will be denied, perhaps for all time . . . that which Congress expressly protected through \nFACA,” i.e.,“[t]he right to view the advisory committee’s discussion of policy matters in \npublic.” Pub. Citizen v. Nat’l Econ. Comm’n, 703 F. Supp. 113, 129 (D.D.C. 1989).  \nPlaintiffs are also severely harmed by the group’s lack of fair balance and Secretary \nWright’s inappropriate influence. It is well-established that being denied “access to a \nrepresentative voice” on an advisory committee is a cognizable injury to parties “directly \nimpacted” by the committee’s work, like Plaintiffs and their members are here. NAACP, 496 F. \nSupp.3d at 128-29; see Uejio, 521 F. Supp. 3d at 145; Cardona, 630 F. Supp. 3d at 180. And \ngiven EPA’s and DOE’s real-time reliance on the CWG’s work, Plaintiffs’ inability “to \ninfluence” the committee is an injury that “cannot be remedied” after the fact. Nw. Ecosystem \nAll., 1999 WL 33526001, at *7; see Dilling Decl. ¶¶ 20-21, 25; Ekwurzel Decl. ¶ 6. \nFinally, Plaintiffs are irreparably harmed by the CWG’s illegal creation, and every action \nit has unlawfully taken since. The secret creation of the CWG, the stacking of its membership \nwith persons of one point of view, and the assignment it was given to produce a report \nundermining the scientific consensus on climate change, all cut to the core of Plaintiffs’ missions \nand their members’ interests. See Dilling Decl. ¶ 20; Brock Decl. ¶¶ 4-5. Plaintiffs and their \nmembers suffer continuing injury every day that this illegally constituted advisory committee \ncontinues to exist, with every action the CWG unlawfully takes, and every time that EPA or \nDOE impermissibly relies on its work. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 22 of 25\nIII.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Merit a Preliminary Injunction \n  The equities and public interest weigh decisively in favor of a preliminary injunction. \nFACA’s purpose is to vindicate “the public[’s] . . . right to know how its government is \nconducting the public’s business.” Pub. Citizen, 703 F. Supp. at 129. That public interest is at its \npeak here: the CWG may be the most consequential advisory committee ever, given the purposes \nfor which the government is relying on it. The report is playing a key role in EPA’s proposed \nrescission of the Endangerment Finding, providing the entire scientific basis for it.  \n  By contrast, Defendants would not suffer cognizable harm by having to comply with their \nFACA obligations. “[I]gnor[ing] the strictures imposed by FACA to prevent unbalanced \ncommissions . . . leav[es] the public to pay any concomitant price.” Dunlap v. Presidential \nAdvisory Comm’n on Election Integrity, 286 F. Supp. 3d 96, 111 (D.D.C. 2017). And an \ninjunction requiring Defendants to comply with FACA before relying on the CWG Report would \nhelp prevent injury to the government, by ensuring that EPA does not devote substantial time and \neffort on its proposed rulemaking only to then later have its linchpin declared unlawful. \nIV.  The Court Should Alternatively Enter Summary Judgment  \n  The Court should alternatively enter summary judgment for Plaintiffs or consolidate the \npreliminary injunction with a trial on the merits under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2). Summary \njudgment is appropriate here because Defendants’ own words establish that the CWG qualifies \nas an advisory committee, and there is no dispute that Defendants did not comply with FACA. \nV.  The Court Should Enter Relief Matching the Breadth of the Violations \n  Several remedies are appropriate here. First, if the Court enters summary judgment, the \nCourt should declare that the CWG is an advisory committee subject to FACA, that Defendants’ \nestablishment and utilization of the CWG is unlawful, and that “any action” taken by the CWG is \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 23 of 25\nunlawful. 5 U.S.C. § 1005(c)(1); see Uejio, 521 F. Supp. 3d at 144 (successful FACA plaintiffs \nmay receive “a declaration that the Defendants’ creation and administration of the [committee] \nviolated FACA and its implementing regulations”); Order at 3, NAACP, No. 20-cv-01132 \n(D.D.C. Oct. 1, 2020) (entering such relief); Nw. Env’t Def. Ctr. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, \n2013 WL 1294647, at *9 (D. Or. Mar. 27, 2013) (same). For Plaintiffs’ APA claims against DOE \nand EPA, the Court should further “set aside” DOE’s unlawful actions in establishing the CWG \nand transmitting its report to EPA, and EPA’s unlawful action in utilizing the CWG report in the \nproposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). If the Court does not enter \nsummary judgment, it should preliminarily provide for this APA relief, by postponing the \neffective date of these actions under 5 U.S.C. § 705, see Orr v. Trump, 788 F. Supp. 3d 394, 431-\n32 (D. Mass. 2025), or “preliminarily set[ting] aside” the actions under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), see \nTrump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2567 (2025) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \n  Second, the Court should enter a preliminary or permanent injunction, and a writ of \nmandamus,2 that prohibits meetings or any other actions by the CWG until Defendants come into \ncompliance with FACA. See, e.g., Order at 2, NAACP, No. 20-cv-01132 (D.D.C. Oct. 1, 2020) \n(“[U]ntil the requirements of the [FACA] have been satisfied, . . . the Commission shall not hold \nfurther meetings . . . .”); Uejio, 521 F. Supp. 3d at 144 (a committee operating unlawfully may be \n“enjoined from meeting, advising the [government], or otherwise conduct[ing] business”).  \n  Third, to remedy Defendants’ violations of FACA’s open records requirements, the Court \nshould enjoin Defendants and/or enter mandamus to make all emails, draft documents, and other \nrecords falling under Section 10(b) available to Plaintiffs and the public on a rolling basis, with \n \n2 The Court may enter relief against defendant agencies and officials under the APA, see Union of Concerned \nScientists, 954 F.3d at 17, and based on ultra vires actions, and against all Defendants under the Mandamus Act, see \nNAACP, 496 F. Supp. 3d at 145 (issuing writ of mandamus compelling advisory committee to comply with FACA). \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 24 of 25\nproduction to be completed within two weeks of the Court’s order. The Court should specify that \nDefendants may not redact Section 10(b) documents pursuant to the deliberative process \nprivilege. The Court should further require Defendants to produce a Vaughn index for all emails \nand other records that CWG members or Defendants possess that broadly relate to the CWG and \nDefendants do not disclose. Defendants should be “expected to err on the side of caution in \ncreating the index” and any “document [that] was created or obtained by a [CWG] member in the \ncourse of his or her work for the [CWG] should be included in the index.” Order at 2, Lawyers’ \nComm, No. 17-cv-01354, ECF No. 28. Courts have ordered a Vaughn index in cases involving \nFACA or other causes of actions seeking information outside of FOIA. Id.; Wash. Legal Found. \nv. U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, 17 F.3d 1446, 1452 (D.C. Cir. 1994). \n  Fourth, the Court should enjoin DOE, EPA, and their officials from using or relying on \nthe unlawfully produced CWG Report. Allowing Defendants to take actions of enormous import \nin reliance on a patently unlawful advisory committee “would circumvent the very policy that \nserves as the foundation of [FACA].” Alabama-Tombigbee Rivers Coal. v. Dep’t of Interior, 26 \nF.3d 1103, 1107 (11th Cir. 1994) (affirming injunction prohibiting agency from using the \n“product of a tainted procedure” that violated FACA). It would also “effectively render FACA a \nnullity.” Cal. Forestry Ass’n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 102 F.3d 609, 614 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see also \nW. Org. of Res. Councils, 412 F. Supp. 3d at 1242 (enjoining agency from relying on committee \nrecommendations or work product because of FACA violation); Uejio, 521 F. Supp. 3d at 144 ( \ncourts may “enjoin[] the use of a committee’s recommendations”). \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should issue a preliminary injunction and a writ of mandamus or, alternatively, \nenter summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs.  \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 16     Filed 08/14/25     Page 25 of 25\nAugust 14, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ Megan M.

ANALYSIS \n \nA. Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nThe Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is \nDENIED.  \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a movant must make a \nclear showing that it is “likely to succeed on the merits, that \nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” \nStarbucks Corp. v. McKinney, 602 U.S. 339, 346 (2024) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  “A preliminary injunction is an \n‘extraordinary’ equitable remedy that is ‘never awarded as of \nright.’”  Id. at 345–46 (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)). \nThis Court rules that the Plaintiffs have failed to \ndemonstrate irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, and therefore, the motion is denied.  The Plaintiffs \nallege that they will suffer such harm in the absence of this \ncourt’s order requiring the Defendants to provide them with the \n \n5 Elec. Clerk’s Notes, ECF No. 53. \n[3] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 57     Filed 09/17/25     Page 4 of 10\nClimate Working Group records.6  ECF No. 16 at 16.  They point to \nthe impending close of public comment on the proposed \nrescissions of the Endangerment Finding and emissions \nregulations by the EPA on September 22nd, 2025, as constituting \nthe core of their informational injury.  In addition, the \nPlaintiffs point to their impaired ability to “inform the public \nand advocate on behalf of their members on an ‘ongoing \nproceeding[] of national importance.’”  Id. (citation omitted). \nInformational injuries have been recognized by other courts \nto warrant preliminary relief in the FACA context.  See Pub. \nCitizen v. Nat'l Econ. Comm'n, 703 F. Supp. 113, 129 (D.D.C. \n1989) (granting a temporary restraining order and temporary \ninjunctive relief in a FACA dispute).  \nIn this case, the Plaintiffs are injured by their inability \nto make informed comments regarding the Climate Working Group to \nEPA during the comment period.  Yet this injury is not \nirreparable.  Any challenge to the EPA’s ultimate decision \nregarding the 2009 Endangerment Finding will likely arise in \nfuture proceedings.  If the Plaintiffs proceed with their \nlitigation and succeed, there is no indication that they will \nnot receive those documents in time to challenge a possible \n \n6 The Defendants – including the Climate Working Group – are \nall represented by the Department of Justice. See Notice of \nAppearance, ECF No. 25. \n[4] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 57     Filed 09/17/25     Page 5 of 10\nfuture recission of the Endangerment Finding in court. Cf. Ctr. \nfor Pub. Integrity v. United States Dep't of Def., 411 F. Supp. \n3d 5 (D.D.C. 2019) (in which requested documents would be useful \nonly for the historical record, as closure of the impeachment \nproceedings themselves were imminent).  The Plaintiffs have \nsubmitted comments regarding their concerns about the validity \nof the Climate Working Group Report to the EPA as a part of the \ncomment process.  While these comments may not be as fully \ninformed as they would otherwise have been had they had the \ndocuments they seek, their inability to submit them at this \nstage of the EPA’s consideration of the Endangerment Finding \ndoes not constitute an irreparable injury.  The Plaintiffs may \nchallenge any final agency action that relies on the Climate \nWorking Group Report in the future, once this challenge has been \nmore thoroughly litigated. \n \nB. Motion for Summary Judgement \nThe Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED \nin part.  Summary judgment is appropriate where “there is \nno genuine dispute of material fact.”  Quintana-Dieppa v. \nDep't of Army, 130 F.4th 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2025) (citing Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(a)).  “The moving party bears the initial \nburden of demonstrating that ‘the nonmoving party has \nfailed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element \nof her case with respect to which she has the burden of \n[5] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 57     Filed 09/17/25     Page 6 of 10\nproof.’”  Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Sharp, 692 F. Supp. \n3d 9, 10–11 (D. Mass. 2023) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)).  That being said, \n“[w]hen the moving party also bears the burden at trial, . \n. . its burden of proof includes ‘producing \nincontrovertible prima facie evidence of its claims.’”  Id. \n(quoting Atlantic Specialty Ins. Co. v. Karl's Boat Shop, \nInc., 480 F.Supp.3d 322 (D. Mass. 2020)).  “This is so \nbecause, even were the evidence supporting the party with \nthe burden of proof uncontroverted, the fact finder could \nchoose to disbelieve it.”  Atlantic Specialty Ins. Co., 480 \nF. Supp.3d at 329 n. 2 (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing \nProd., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 151 (2000)). \nThe Plaintiffs ask this court to declare the Climate \nWorking Group an advisory committee subject to FACA.  The \nDefendants oppose this motion for summary judgement on the \ngrounds that the Climate Working Group is exempt from FACA \nbecause it was “assembled to exchange facts or information with \na Federal official.” 41 C.F.R. 102-3.40(e).  \nThis Court rules that the Climate Working Group was not \nassembled to “exchange facts or information” in a manner that \nwould bring it into the claimed exception.  The 3.40(e) \nexception has, in the past, been held to apply to “ad hoc, \nindividualized group[s]” rather than defined, organized groups. \n[6] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 57     Filed 09/17/25     Page 7 of 10\nSee Heartwood, Inc. v. U.S. Forest Service, 431 F.Supp.2d 28, 35 \n(2006).  An example of a committee that would fall into this \nexception was described in Nader v. Baroody, 396 F. Supp. 1231 \n(D.D.C. 1975), in which a White House program brought in a group \nof entirely new individuals every two weeks to “encourage an \nexchange of views” between Executive officials and the private \nsector.  See Nader, 396 F. Supp. at 1232.  Conversely, the \nexception was held inapplicable to a group that was “assembled \nfor the single purpose” of drafting an ecological assessment to \ninform agency policy-making.  Heartwood, 431 F.Supp.2d at 35. \nEven though the convening agency in Heartwood expressly asked \nthe committee not to provide any recommendations in their draft \nreport and emphasized that it made “no management decisions or \nrecommendations”, the court found the committee’s work to have \nbeen done “in the interest of obtaining advice or \nrecommendations for ... one or more agencies.”  Id. (quoting \nwhat is now 5 U.S.C. 10 §1001(2)(A)). \nThe Defendants allege that a “mutual exchange [of] facts or \ninformation” between government officials at DOE and the Climate \nWorking Group “undisputably” occurred.7  A single act of \n \n7 See Opp’n, ECF No. 43, at 10. (“Dr. Curry explained that \n‘[t]he reviews [by DOE] were quite interesting and varied, and \nseveral were very useful. The CWG made a number of fairly minor \nchanges to the Report in response to the reviews, and added a \nnumber of references, and we are responding in detail to their \ncomments.’ Id.”)  \n[7] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 57     Filed 09/17/25     Page 8 of 10\nincorporating feedback on a draft of an otherwise independent8 \nreport, however, is not analogous to the prolonged exchanges \n  \nbetween indeterminate groups described in Nader and Food & Water \nWatch v. Trump, 357 F. Supp. 3d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2018).  In both of \nthose cases, no reports were ever produced and the informational \nexchange between government officials and the groups were the \nprimary focus, rather than incidental byproduct, of the \ncommittees.  \nThe Defendants’ citation to Nat'l Anti-Hunger Coal. v. \nExec. Comm. of President's Priv. Sector Surv. on Cost Control, \n557 F. Supp. 524 (D.D.C.), aff'd, 711 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1983) \nis inapposite.  There, the “task forces” determined to be exempt \nfrom FACA were created by a FACA Committee itself – whereas the \nundisputed facts in the instant case show that Secretary Wright \nhimself invited the members of the Climate Working Group to \nparticipate.  Res. Statement. Facts, ECF No. 45 at 5.  Even in \nthe case where an agency “expressly asked [the committee] not to \nprovide any recommendations in their draft reports” and the \n“final publication emphasizes that it ‘makes no management \n \n8 “We agreed to undertake the work on the condition that \nthere would be no editorial oversight by the Secretary, the \nDepartment of Energy, or any other government personnel. This \ncondition has been honored throughout the process and the \nwriting team has worked with full independence.” CWG Report at \nx, ECF No. 17-1. \n[8] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 57     Filed 09/17/25     Page 9 of 10\ndecisions or recommendations’”, that court found FACA to apply.  \nHeartwood, 431 F.Supp.2d at 35. \nSo it is here.  The conclusion of the report itself shows \nthat it is no mere “review” of the literature.  To suggest \notherwise borders on sophistry. The report states that it \nsupports  a  more  nuanced  and  evidence-based  approach  for \ninforming  climate  policy  that  explicitly  acknowledges \nuncertainties. The risks and benefits of a climate changing \nunder  both  natural  and  human  influences  must  be  weighed \nagainst the costs, efficacy, and collateral impacts of any \n“climate action”, considering the nation’s need for reliable \nand affordable energy with minimal local pollution. Beyond \ncontinuing precise, un-interrupted observations of the global \nclimate  system,  it  will  be  important  to  make  realistic \nassumptions  about  future  emissions,  re-evaluate  climate \nmodels  to  address  biases  and  uncertainties,  and  clearly \nacknowledge  the  limitations  of  extreme  event  attribution \nstudies.  An  approach  that  acknowledges  both  the  potential \nrisks  and  benefits  of  CO2,  rather  than  relying  on  flawed \nmodels and extreme scenarios, is essential for informed and \neffective decision-making.  \n \nCWG Report, ECF 17-1, at 130.  By advocating for an approach \nthat “acknowledges both the potential risks and benefits of CO2” \nand “weighing” risks and benefits against costs and collateral \nimpacts, the authors of this report have provided “advice or \nrecommendations.”  5 U.S.C. § 1001(2)(A).  No reasonable jury \ncould find that these words, arranged as they are, do not \nconstitute advice or recommendations for a renewed approach to \nclimate policy. \nSince this Court rules that the 3.40(e) exception does not \napply to the Climate Working Group, the Plaintiff’s Motion for \n[9] \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12249-WGY     Document 57     Filed 09/17/25     Page 10 of 10\nSummary Judgement is GRANTED but as to non-applicability of the \nexception only.
