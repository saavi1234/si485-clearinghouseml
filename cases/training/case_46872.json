    "summary": "<p>During his first eight months in office, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders that directed government agencies to add new conditions to federal grants, including, Executive Order 14168, which instructed agencies to end funding of &ldquo;gender ideology&rdquo; and ensure grants did not promote it, &nbsp;Executive Order 14173, which directed agencies to ban programs promoting Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and make compliance &ldquo;material&rdquo; under the False Claims Act, and Executive Order 14332 which required discretionary grants to advance the President&rsquo;s policy priorities and prohibited use of funds for racial preferences, denial of the sex binary, or &ldquo;anti-American values.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 20, 2025, several cities and counties in California, as well as the Monroe County Airport Authority in New York, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and its Secretary; and several other federal agencies and their respective leadership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs challenged conditions Defendants imposed on federal grants to coerce compliance with executive policy objectives as outlined in President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Orders. Plaintiffs alleged that these conditions were unconstitutionally vague and violated Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, and the Fifth and Tenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs also alleged that implementation of conditions imposed by Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Plaintiffs requested declarations from the court that grant conditions outlined by Defendants were unlawful, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from imposing or enforcing the grant conditions or any materially similar terms or conditions.</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, 2025, the case was assigned to Chief United States District Judge Richard Seeborg. That same day, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) asking the court to immediately halt enforcement of grant conditions that required compliance with President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Orders. On August 27, 2025, Judge Seeborg granted the TRO. First, looking at jurisdictional concerns, standing, and ripeness, the court found the challenged grant conditions constituted &ldquo;final agency action&rdquo; under the APA because they imposed an &ldquo;&lsquo;immediate and significant practical burden&rsquo; on Plaintiffs.&rdquo; Judge Seeborg then turned to the merits, finding that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed. In weighing the harms, Judge Seeborg found that Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if the grant conditions were not enjoined because Plaintiffs would be forced to choose between complying with grant conditions that were &ldquo;likely unconstitutional\" or &ldquo;forgoing key federal grant funding.&rdquo; The court denied Defendants&rsquo; request for a bond, finding that there was &ldquo;no realistic likelihood of harm&rdquo; to Defendants by enjoining their conduct. The court additionally held that the public interest was &ldquo;served&rdquo; by allowing Plaintiffs clarity in the funding they would be allotted, which would then be used to provide key services to the public. 2025 WL 2469330.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;On September 8, 2025, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, naming four additional Plaintiffs, expanding venue to San Francisco and Oakland Division to include the new Plaintiffs and adding additional allegations of fact, as to specific grant programs and projects that were affected by the Executive Orders&rsquo; grant conditions. Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, with their arguments for a preliminary injunction mirroring those accepted by Judge Seeborg when he granted Plaintiffs&rsquo; TRO. The court granted the preliminary injunction on September 23, 2025. The court found that the agencies&rsquo; actions in imposing grant conditions were arbitrary and capricious and &ldquo;in excess of statutory authority,&rdquo; in violation of the APA. The grant conditions were also &ldquo;contrary to the constitution&rdquo; because they violated due process and separation of power. Thus, Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim. The court also weighed the harms as it did when it granted Plaintiffs&rsquo; TRO, and again found that Plaintiffs stood to face irreparable harm. 2025 WL 2721390.</p>\r\n<p>This case remains ongoing. While TROs are not appealable, preliminary injunctions are. It is possible that the administration will appeal, though this had not happened as of October 1.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "In his first eight months as president, Donald Trump signed several orders that changed the rules for getting money from the federal government. One order blocked funding for anything related to “gender ideology.” Another order stopped support for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, and said groups could face serious consequences if they broke these rules. A third order said that grants had to match the president’s priorities. This order also banned giving money based on racial preferences, denying the idea that there are only two sexes, or promoting “anti-American values.”\r\nOn August 20, 2025, some cities and counties in California, along with an airport group in New York State, sued the government. They filed their case in a federal court in California. They said the new grant rules were unfair, too confusing, possibly unconstitutional, and didn’t follow the proper steps when making new rules. They asked the court to stop the government from using these rules.\r\n\r\nThe case went to Chief Judge Richard Seeborg. On August 27, the judge said the government had to stop using the new rules for now. He said the rules hurt the cities and counties, probably violated the law, and could cause serious problems if they continued. He also said the public should know exactly what the funding rules are.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, the plaintiffs (the cities, counties, and airport group) added more people and more examples to their lawsuit. They also asked the judge to keep blocking the new rules for a longer time. On September 23, the judge agreed with them again and said the government agencies went too far, did not follow the law, and possibly violated the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe case is still ongoing.",

INTRODUCTION \n2 Plaintiffs bring this action reluctantly, only after the current Administration’s actions have left \n3 them no other means of protecting the federal funding essential to their communities.  For years, \n4 Plaintiffs have relied on congressionally authorized grant programs to deliver core public services that \n5 safeguard public safety and health, connect residents to opportunity, and sustain local economies.  They \n6 have endeavored to work cooperatively with federal agencies to administer these programs, but the \n7 lawful and predictable administration of these grants has now been upended. \n8 The Constitution vests Congress—not the Executive—with the authority to make laws and \n9 appropriate federal funds.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8; Cunningham v. Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 83–84 (1890).  \n10 While the Executive Branch is charged with faithfully executing the laws enacted by Congress, that duty \n11 does not include the power to unilaterally rewrite or expand the statutory terms under which federal \n12 funds are awarded.  City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931, 945 (9th Cir. 2019); City & Cnty. of San \n13 Francisco v. Barr, 965 F.3d 753, 766 (9th Cir. 2020). \n14 Here, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the U.S. Department of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and the U.S. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Department of Transportation (“DOT”)—including its operating administrations1 such as the Federal \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Transit Administration (“FTA”), the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”), and the Federal \nN\nN\nE 18 Aviation Administration (“FAA”) (collectively, the “Defendants”)—have imposed vague and \nR\n19 unauthorized conditions on federal grants to coerce compliance with executive policy preferences.  These \n20 actions exceed Defendants’ constitutional and statutory authority, erode the separation of powers, and \n21 disregard core constitutional and statutory protections, including the Tenth Amendment’s anti-\n22 commandeering principle, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the Administrative \n23 Procedure Act’s (“APA”) procedural safeguards. \n24 Defendants’ overbroad interpretation and enforcement of these conditions are not hypothetical.  \n25 On or around August 18, 2025, the City of Fresno received an email from HUD notifying it that HUD “is \n26  \n1 The FAA, FTA, FHWA, and similar modal agencies within the DOT are officially known as \n27 “Operating Administrations.”  See 49 C.F.R. § 9.3 (defining ‘operating administrations’ to include FAA, \nFTA, FHWA, and others within the Department of Transportation); 49 C.F.R. pt. 1, subpt. D (delegating \n28 authority to Operating Administrations). \n    -3-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 4 of 108\n1 questioning the accuracy of the City of Fresno’s certification that the Community Development Block \n2 Grant (CDBG) funds described in its Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action Plan (the Plan) will be \n3 administered in conformity with applicable laws, including Executive Orders.”  HUD has directed Fresno \n4 to remove all references to the words “equity,” “environmental justice,” and all transgender references, \n5 and provide assurances that “[t]he City of Fresno shall not use grant funds to promote ‘gender ideology,’ \n6 as defined in Executive Order (E.O.) 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and \n7 Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”  HUD directed Fresno to take these actions no \n8 later than 12:00 pm EDT Thursday, August 21, 2025, and provided that “failure to address HUD’s \n9 concerns regarding the certification may result in HUD determining that the certification is inaccurate or \n10 unsatisfactory, which will result in disapproval of the Plan.”  Defendants’ unlawful attempts to repurpose \n11 congressionally established grant programs to serve unilateral policy goals have placed at risk hundreds \n12 of millions of dollars in funding already awarded or soon to be awarded to Plaintiffs.  If allowed to stand, \n13 these unauthorized and unlawful conditions will severely compromise Plaintiffs’ ability to maintain safe \n14 and reliable transportation infrastructure, ensure aviation safety, public health, and sustain essential \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 transit services.  These consequences would ripple across the economy, leaving Plaintiffs more \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 vulnerable to accidents, service failures, and disinvestment.  Plaintiffs, therefore, have been forced to file \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 this suit not out of preference, but out of necessity, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent \nN\nN\nE 18 the enforcement of these unlawful conditions and to preserve their ability to carry out the federally \nR\n19 funded programs their residents depend on. \n20 II.  JURISDICTION \n21 1.  The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  This Court has further remedial \n22 authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202 et seq. \n23 2.  Venue properly lies within the Northern District of California because this is an action \n24 against an officer or employee of the United States and an agency of the United States, Plaintiffs County \n25 of Marin, City of Eureka, City of Alameda and City of Redwood City reside in this judicial district, and a \n26 substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this district.  28 U.S.C. § \n27 1391(e)(1). \n28  \n    -4-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 5 of 108\n1 3.  Divisional Assignment: Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 3-2(d), except as provided in Civil \n2 L.R. 3-2(c), all civil actions that arise in the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San \n3 Francisco, San Mateo or Sonoma shall be assigned to the San Francisco Division or the Oakland \n4 Division..  This action arises in various counties, including the counties of Alameda, Marin, and San \n5 Mateo.   \n6 III.  PARTIES \n7 4.  Plaintiff City of Fresno is a municipal corporation and charter city organized and existing \n8 under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California.  Fresno’s city-operated airports have been \n9 allocated approximately $50 million in FAA grants for capital improvement projects and anticipate \n10 approximately $100 million in additional grant funding to complete planned airport infrastructure \n11 improvements, including the construction of a new air traffic control tower.  If Fresno does not accept the \n12 FAA’s newly imposed conditions and submit its reimbursement request by the end of September, more \n13 than $13 million in already allocated and expended grant funds will lapse, leaving Fresno unable to \n14 recover those funds. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 5.  Fresno has also been awarded or allocated approximately $11.7 million annually in HUD \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 grants administered through various programs under HUD’s Office of Community Planning and \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Development (“CPD”), over $100 million in DOT grants, described further below, to fund a broad range \nN\nN\nE 18 of transportation and infrastructure projects, and $2.2 million in Brownfields grants from the EPA. In \nR\n19 addition, as a Designated Subrecipient of Caltrans, Fresno was approved for a $600,000 grant from DOT \n20 through Caltrans for the construction of a pedestrian bridge over Highway 99. Fresno was also awarded a \n21 5339a grant for $1,264,735 this June for Fresno’s ongoing Facility Improvement project for the Fresno \n22 Area Express (“FAX”) yard, which houses Fresno’s public transit buses.  \n23 6.  Plaintiff County of Sacramento is a political subdivision of the State of California and a \n24 home rule charter County.  County of Sacramento owns and operates the County’s Airport System, \n25 consisting of four airports: Sacramento International (“SMF”), Mather (“MHR”), Sacramento Executive \n26 (“SAC”), and Franklin Field (“F72”)—through its Department of Airports, except for SAC, which is \n27 leased from the City of Sacramento.  The Airport System operates as a self-supporting enterprise fund, \n28 relying solely on airport revenues and federal funding, with no local tax dollars.  \n    -5-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 6 of 108\n1 7.  County of Sacramento depends heavily on FAA grants, including Airport Improvement \n2 Program (“AIP”) entitlement and discretionary grants, and Airport Infrastructure Grants (“AIG”) and \n3 Airport Terminal Program (“ATP”) grants.  From 2021 through 2023, the County received a total of \n4 $22,498,822 in AIP grants.  In 2024, the FAA awarded the Airport System $14,573,636 in AIP grants.  \n5 To date, the FAA also has awarded $45,166,763 in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”) \n6 grants to the Airport System.  In addition to these grants, the FAA has set aside approximately $70 \n7 million to relocate and construct a new air traffic control tower at SMF.  The County expects to receive \n8 approximately $9.5 million in grant funding for additional rehabilitation work on Runway 4R/22L at \n9 MHR.  To continue meeting the needs of the Airport System’s rapidly growing catchment area, the \n10 Department also will apply for, and anticipates receiving, an additional $167.5 million in combined AIP \n11 and IIJA grants to finance various capital projects.   \n12 8.  In 2024, County of Sacramento secured a Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \n13 Innovation Act (“TIFIA”) loan from DOT’s Build America Bureau, which provides low-cost loans to \n14 eligible large-scale infrastructure projects.  The $36.1 million TIFIA loan is also financing the Pedestrian \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Walkway Project, which is scheduled to open in the summer of 2026. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 9.  County of Sacramento’s Department of Health Services encompasses Behavioral Health \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Services, Public Health, Primary Care Services, and Correctional Health Services.  The County also \nN\nN\nE 18 owns and operates a federally qualified health center (“FQHC”), known as the County of Sacramento \nR\n19 Health Center.  The County’s Health budget relies on many millions of dollars in federal funding, \n20 including sizeable grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and its \n21 divisions.  Currently, the County holds direct and sub-recipient federal grant allocations from HHS, \n22 including HRSA, CDC, SAMHSA, and other DHHS Administrative agencies, totaling nearly $148 \n23 million.  \n24 10.  County of Sacramento receives HUD funding for the support of critical and essential \n25 homeless services and housing programs and projects as a passthrough subrecipient entity from \n26 Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency (“SHRA”) and Sacramento Steps Forward (“SSF”), \n27 the lead agency for Sacramento’s Continuum of Care (“CoC”).  Currently, about $277,500 of Emergency \n28 Solutions Grant (“ESG”) and $363,000 Community Development Block Grant Programs (“CDBG”) \n    -6-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 7 of 108\n1 Public Service funds are used to operate the Mather Community Campus Singles Shelter, which provides \n2 shelter, supportive services, and re-housing for up to 150 adults.  \n3 11.  County of Sacramento relies on federal funding from the DOT, FHWA, and FTA to \n4 provide critical transportation planning and improvements.  For FY2025, the County was allocated \n5 $463,882 in Section 5311 grant funds and has received the updated FTA Certifications and Assurances \n6 that must be executed within the next few weeks to maintain eligibility for continued FTA formula \n7 grants.  In FYs 2023–2024 and 2024–2025, the County received approximately $47,991,689 in FHWA \n8 funds to support bridge replacement, street rehabilitation, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, and \n9 other critical projects, and for FY 2025–2026 it has budgeted an additional $33 million in FHWA \n10 funding for similar work.  The County has also been awarded two discretionary FHWA grants: $800,000 \n11 from the Bridge Investment Program and $1,859,680 from the Advanced Transportation Technology and \n12 Innovation Program for its County of Sacramento Complete Pedestrian Trips project.  In total, these \n13 federal transportation funds amount to approximately $84 million. \n14 12.  Plaintiff City of South Lake Tahoe is a municipal corporation organized under the existing \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 laws of the State of California.  The City of South Lake Tahoe owns and operates the Lake Tahoe Airport \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 (“TVL”) as a division of its Public Works Department and serves as the airport sponsor for purposes of \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 federal grant funding.  TVL is a general aviation airport and is the only airport within the Lake Tahoe \nN\nN\nE 18 Basin, thereby serving an important role in the area’s economy and a critical role in public safety for \nR\n19 aircraft access and emergency response staging during large-scale emergencies such as wildfires. \n20 13.  The City of South Lake Tahoe depends on FAA grants to support critical capital projects \n21 and maintenance to comply with federally imposed safety requirements, including AIP entitlement and \n22 discretionary grants, and AIG grants.  Annually, the City of South Lake Tahoe receives approximately \n23 $150,000 in AIP entitlement funds and was allocated $556,000 in AIG grants for Fiscal Years 2022–\n24 2025.  The City currently holds FAA grant allocations totaling approximately $1,050,000 for critical \n25 capital projects, including its Pavement Maintenance and Management Program and Airport Master Plan.  \n26 The City of South Lake Tahoe anticipates needing approximately $20 million in FAA funding over the \n27 next three years for Taxiway Alpha Reconstruction, a project necessary to maintain compliance with \n28 federal safety standards and ensure safe aircraft operations. \n    -7-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 8 of 108\n1 14.  Plaintiff City of Eureka is a municipal corporation and charter city organized and existing \n2 under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California.  Eureka is a recipient of substantial federal \n3 funding administered by both HUD and the DOT.  The City will be seeking $5,000,000 in Safe Streets \n4 and Roads for All (“SS4A”) grants for future implementation projects and $1,030,111 in Emergency \n5 Solutions Grant (“ESG”) funding. Eureka also frequently utilizes other HUD programs, including \n6 Community Development Block Grants (“CDBG”) and Continuum of Care grants, and intends to pursue \n7 additional grant opportunities in upcoming funding cycles. \n8 15.  Plaintiff City of Saint Paul is a municipal corporation organized and existing under and by \n9 virtue of the laws of the State of Minnesota.  It is a charter city.  Saint Paul is a recipient of substantial \n10 federal funding administered by both HUD and the DOT.  Through HUD, Saint Paul receives entitlement \n11 grants allocated by statutory formula, including CDBG, HOME, ESG, as well as congressionally directed \n12 earmark funding.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2 A.  HUD Grant Programs \n3 54.  Congress established HUD in 1965 to promote the “sound development of the Nation’s \n4 communities and metropolitan areas” by, among other things, administering programs that “provide \n5 assistance for housing” and “development.”  Department of Housing and Urban Development Act, 1965 \n6 § 2, Pub. L. No. 89-174, 79 Stat. 667.  The HUD Secretary is responsible for all actions taken by the \n7 Department and its component offices.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 3533, 3535; 24 C.F.R. Part 5.  HUD \n8 administers both competitive and formula grant programs.  Competitive grant programs “allocate[] a \n9 limited pool of funds to state and local applicants whose applications are approved by” a federal agency.  \n10 City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 F.3d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir. 2019).  Entitlement grant programs \n11 (sometimes referred to as formula grant programs) “are awarded pursuant to a statutory formula” wherein \n12 “Congress determines who the recipients are and how much money each shall receive.”  City of Los \n13 Angeles v. McLaughlin, 865 F.2d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 1989) (cleaned up).  HUD administers grants \n14 directly and through its program offices, including the Office of Community Planning & Development \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 (CPD), and regional field offices.  See 24 C.F.R. subchapter C (CPD-administered programs); id. § \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 982.101 (allocating budget authority for Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program to field offices).  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 1.  Continuum of Care Grant Program \nN\nN\nE 18 55.  Congress established the Continuum of Care (“CoC”) program through the enactment of \nR\n19 the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (the “Homeless Assistance Act”). 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301, \n20 11381.  The program’s “purpose” is to “promote community-wide commitment to the goal of ending \n21 homelessness” by “provid[ing] funding for efforts by nonprofit providers and State and local \n22 governments to quickly rehouse homeless individuals and families.”  Id. §11381.  In addition, the CoC \n23 program is designed to promote access to and effective utilization of mainstream programs by homeless \n24 individuals and families; and to optimize self-sufficiency among those experiencing homelessness.  Id.   \n25 56.  The Homeless Assistance Act directs the Secretary of HUD (the “HUD Secretary”) to \n26 award CoC grants on a competitive basis using statutorily prescribed selection criteria.  42 U.S.C. \n27 §11382(a).  These grants fund critical homelessness services administered by grant recipients either \n28 directly or through service providers contracted by the grant recipient.  The CoC program funds a variety \n    -15-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 16 of 108\n1 of programs that support homeless individuals and families, including through the construction of \n2 supportive housing, rehousing support, rental assistance, and supportive services, including childcare, job \n3 training, healthcare, mental health services, trauma counseling, and life skills training.  Id. §11360 (29), \n4 11383.  \n5 57.  Grants are awarded to local coalitions, or “Continuums,” that may include representatives \n6 from local governments, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, advocacy groups, public housing \n7 agencies, universities, and other stakeholders.  24 C.F.R § 578.3.  Each Continuum designates an \n8 applicant to apply for CoC funding on behalf of the Continuum.  Id.  \n9 a.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and HUD Promulgates Rules, \n10 Regarding CoC Grant Conditions  \n11 58.  HUD’s administration of the CoC program, including the award of CoC grants, is \n12 authorized and governed by statutory directives.  Congress has specified what activities are eligible for \n13 funding under the CoC program, the selection criteria HUD must apply in awarding CoC grants, and \n14 program requirements HUD can require recipients agree to as conditions for receiving funds.  See 42 \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 U.S.C. §§ 11383, 11386, 11386a. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 59.  Section 422 of the Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11382, contains Congress’s \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 overarching authorization for HUD to award CoC grants. Subsection (A) of that section states: \nN\nEN 18 The Secretary shall award grants, on a competitive basis, and using the \nR\nselection criteria described in section 11386a of this title, to carry out \neligible activities under this part for projects that meet the program \n19\nrequirements under section 11386 of this title, either by directly awarding \nfunds to project sponsors or by awarding funds to unified funding agencies. \n20\n21\n60.  Section 427 of the Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11386a, provides for the HUD \n22\nSecretary to establish selection criteria to evaluate grant applications and sets forth specific criteria the \n23\nHUD Secretary must use.  These required criteria include things like the recipient’s previous \n24\nperformance in addressing homelessness, whether the recipient has demonstrated coordination with other \n25\npublic and private entities serving homeless individuals, and the need within the geographic area for \n26\nhomeless services.  Id. (b)(1)-(2). \n27\n28\n    -16-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 17 of 108\n1 61.  Section 426 of the Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11386, sets forth “[r]equired \n2 agreements” to which grant recipients must adhere.  Recipients must agree to, among other things, \n3 “monitor and report to the [HUD] Secretary the progress of the project,” “take the educational needs of \n4 children into account when families are placed in emergency or transitional shelter,” “place families with \n5 children as close as possible to their school of origin,” and obtain various certifications from direct \n6 service providers. 42 U.S.C. § 11386(b). \n7 62.  The Homeless Assistance Act does not authorize HUD to condition CoC funding on \n8 opposition to all forms of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies and initiatives through the guise \n9 of federal nondiscrimination law, nor on participating in aggressive and lawless immigration \n10 enforcement, exclusion of transgender people, or cutting off access to information about lawful \n11 abortions. \n12 63.  Congress has authorized the Secretary to promulgate regulations establishing, inter alia, \n13 other selection criteria and “other terms and conditions” on grant funding “to carry out [the CoC \n14 program] in an effective and efficient manner.”  Id. §§ 11386(b)(8), 11386a(b)(1)(G), 11387. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 64.  Pursuant to this authority, HUD has promulgated the Continuum of Care Program rule at \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 24 C.F.R. part 578 (the “CoC Rule”), which, among other things, sets forth additional conditions to \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 which grant recipients must agree in the CoC grant agreements they execute with HUD.  Id. § 578.23(c). \nN\nN\nE 18 While CoC Rule permits HUD to require CoC recipients to comply with additional “terms and \nR\n19 conditions,” such terms and conditions must be “establish[ed] by” a Notice of Funding Opportunity \n20 (NOFO).2  Id. § 578.23(c)(12). \n21 65.  The CoC Rule does not impose any conditions on CoC funding related to prohibiting all \n22 kinds of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or \n23 prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” Congress has not delegated \n24 authority that would permit an agency to adopt such conditions. \n25\n26  \n2 The terms NOFO, “Notice of Funding Availability,” and “Funding Opportunity Announcement” refer \n27 to a formal announcement of the availability of federal funding. As part of an effort to standardize \nterminology, most federal agencies now use the term NOFO. For clarity, this Complaint uses the term \n28 NOFO.  \n    -17-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 18 of 108\n1 b.  Congress Appropriates CoC Grant Funding and Authorizes HUD to \n2 Issue a NOFO for Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 \n3 66.  Funding for CoC grants comes from congressional discretionary appropriations. \n4 67.  Most recently, Congress appropriated funds for the CoC program in the Consolidated \n5 Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25 (the “2024 Appropriations Act”).  \n6 68.  The 2024 Appropriations Act contains additional directives to HUD regarding CoC \n7 funding.  For instance, it requires the Secretary to “prioritize funding. . . to continuums of care that have \n8 demonstrated a capacity to reallocate funding from lower performing projects to higher performing \n9 projects,” and requires the Secretary to “provide incentives to create projects that coordinate with \n10 housing providers and healthcare organizations to provide permanent supportive housing and rapid re-\n11 housing services.”  Id., 138 Stat. 362-363. \n12 69.  The 2024 Appropriations Act also authorized HUD to issue a two-year NOFO for Fiscal \n13 Years 2024 and 2025 program funding.  Id., 138 Stat. 386. \n14 70.  By statute, the HUD Secretary must announce recipients within five months after the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 submission of applications for funding in response to the NOFO.  42 U.S.C. § 11382(c)(2). \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 71.  The HUD Secretary’s announcement is a “conditional award,” in that the recipient must \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 meet “all requirements for the obligation of those funds, including site control, matching funds, and \nN\nN\nE 18 environmental review requirements.”  Id. § 11382(d)(1)(A). \nR\n19 72.  Once the recipient meets those requirements, HUD must obligate the funds within 45 \n20 days.  Id. § 11382(d)(2) (providing that “the Secretary shall obligate the funds”). \n21 73.  None of the 2024 Appropriations Act’s directives to HUD or any other legislation \n22 authorize HUD to impose CoC grant fund conditions related to prohibiting all kinds of DEI, facilitating \n23 enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \n24 “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n25 c.  HUD Conditionally Awards CoC Grants  \n26 74.  In July 2024, HUD posted a biennial NOFO announcing a competition for CoC funding \n27 for Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 (the “FYs 2024 & 2025 NOFO”).  See U.S. Dep’t of Housing & Urban \n28 Dev., Notice of Funding Opportunity for FY 2024 and FY 2025 Continuum of Care Competition and \n    -18-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 19 of 108\n1 Renewal or Replacement of Youth Homeless Demonstration Program (Jul. 24, 2024), \n2 https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/CPD/documents/FY2024_FY2025_CoC_and_YHDP_NOFO_FR-6800-\n3 N-25.pdf. \n4 75.  The FYs 2024 & 2025 NOFO directed Continuums to consider policy priorities in their \n5 applications, including “Racial Equity” and “Improving Assistance to LGBTQ+ Individuals.”  Id. at 9.  \n6 The FYs 2024 & 2025 NOFO specified that “HUD is emphasizing system and program changes to \n7 address racial equity within CoCs and projects. Responses to preventing and ending homelessness should \n8 address racial inequities . . . .”  Id.  The FYs 2024 & 2025 NOFO further specified that “CoC should \n9 address the needs of LGBTQ+, transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary individuals and \n10 families in their planning processes.  Additionally, when considering which projects to select in their \n11 local competition to be included in their application to HUD, CoCs should ensure that all projects \n12 provide privacy, respect, safety, and access regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.”  Id.  \n13 76.  The NOFO did not include any grant conditions prohibiting DEI efforts, facilitating \n14 enforcement of federal immigration laws, verifying immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  Nor did any of the 2024 Appropriations Act’s directives to \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 HUD or any other legislation authorize HUD to impose such conditions on CoC grants. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 77.  CoC grants fund permanent supportive housing programs, which provide long-term, \nN\nN\nE 18 affordable housing combined with supportive services for individuals and families experiencing, or at \nR\n19 risk of homelessness.  Such supportive services include case management which provides links to \n20 healthcare, job training, and other resources that facilitate their ability to obtain and keep their housing.  \n21 These programs allow participating individuals and families to live independently and stably in their \n22 communities.   \n23 2.  Community Development Block Grant Program \n24 78.  Congress established the Community Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) program \n25 through Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the “HCD Act”), Pub. L. 93-\n26 383, 88 Stat. 633, and subsequent amendments.  The program’s stated “primary objective” is to promote \n27 “development of viable urban communities” through “decent housing,” a “suitable living environment,” \n28 and “expan[sion of] economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income.”  42 \n    -19-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 20 of 108\n1 U.S.C. § 5301(c).  Specific objectives include “conserv[ing] and expan[ding] the Nation’s housing stock” \n2 especially for low- and moderate-income households, promoting mixed-income communities, and \n3 enhancing the “diversity and vitality of neighborhoods” by eliminating slums or blight and revitalizing \n4 “deteriorating or deteriorated neighborhoods,” among other goals.  Id. § 5301(c)(1), (c)(3), (c)(6). \n5 79.  The CDBG program is codified at title 42, chapter 69 of the U.S. Code.  The program \n6 provides flexible funding through annual block grants awarded on a formula basis to state and local \n7 governments for purposes related to economic and community development.  In enacting the program, \n8 Congress consolidated “a number of complex and overlapping” grant programs such that funding would \n9 be provided “on an annual basis, with maximum certainty and minimum delay,” and communities could \n10 “rely [on funding] in their planning.”  Id. § 5301(d).  The HCD Act permits communities to tailor \n11 program activities to meet local needs so long as they advance national objectives identified by Congress, \n12 including benefiting low- and moderate-income persons, preventing or eliminating slums or blight, or, in \n13 certain cases, responding to serious and immediate threats to community health or welfare where other \n14 funds are unavailable.  Id. §§ 5301(c), 5304(b)(4). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 80.  The HCD Act authorizes the HUD Secretary to award CDBG funds using statutorily \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 prescribed selection criteria.  42 U.S.C. §§ 5303–04.  The HUD Secretary must distribute funds annually \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 using a formula that considers population and measures of distress including poverty, age of housing, \nN\nN\nE 18 housing overcrowding, and growth lag.  Id. §§ 5303–04, 5306.  These grants fund vital urban community \nR\n19 development projects and public services administered by grant recipients either directly or through \n20 service providers contracted by the grant recipient.  See id. § 5305 (listing activities eligible for \n21 assistance). \n22 d.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and HUD Promulgates Rules \n23 Regarding CDBG Grant Conditions  \n24 81.  HUD’s administration of the CDBG program, including the award of block grants, is \n25 authorized and governed by statutory directives.  Congress has specified what activities are eligible for \n26 funding under the CDBG program, the selection criteria HUD must apply in awarding CDBG grants, and \n27 program requirements HUD can require recipients agree to as conditions for receiving funds.  See 42 \n28 U.S.C. §§ 5301, 5304–05.   \n    -20-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 21 of 108\n1 82.  Section 103 of the HCD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 5303, contains Congress’s overarching \n2 authorization to award CDBG funding.  That provision states in relevant part: “The Secretary is \n3 authorized to make grants to States, units of general local government, and Indian tribes to carry out \n4 activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.” \n5 83.  In addition to the statutory objectives and allocation formula discussed above, Congress \n6 has imposed other requirements on CDBG funds.  For instance, 42 U.S.C. § 5305 limits the use of \n7 CDBG funds to enumerated eligible activities.  The HCD Act also mandates that recipients use at least \n8 70% of CDBG funds on activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, id. \n9 § 5301(c), and prescribes eligibility criteria for such activities, id. § 5305(c).  Grant recipients must also \n10 submit annual plans to the HUD Secretary describing their priority nonhousing community development \n11 needs eligible for CDBG funding pursuant to procedures set out in the HCD Act.  Id. § 5304(m).  Finally, \n12 Congress has enumerated various certifications that CDBG recipients must make as a condition of \n13 receiving funds, including that the recipient will develop and follow a citizen participation plan, comply \n14 with statutory transparency requirements, ensure funds are consistent with the HCD Act’s objectives, and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 administer programs in conformity with nondiscrimination laws.  Id. § 5304(a)(3), (b). \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 84.  The HCD Act does not authorize HUD to condition CDBG funding on prohibiting all \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or \nN\nN\nE 18 prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  \nR\n19 85.  The HCD Act indicates congressional intent to benefit historically disadvantaged groups.  \n20 For example, the Act requires the Secretary to set aside some of the funds appropriated for the CDBG \n21 program for “special purpose grants,” which may include, among other things, grants to “historically \n22 Black colleges.”  42 U.S.C. § 5307(b)(2).  The Act further provides that, of the amount set aside for \n23 special purpose grants, the Secretary “shall” make grants to institutions of higher education “for the \n24 purpose of providing assistance to economically disadvantaged and minority students who participate in \n25 community development work study programs and are enrolled in” qualifying degree programs.  Id. \n26 § 5307(c).  The Act also authorizes urban development action grants to cities and urban counties \n27 experiencing severe economic distress, but only if the HUD Secretary determines the city or county has \n28 “demonstrated results in,” among other things, “providing equal opportunity in housing and employment \n    -21-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 22 of 108\n1 for low- and moderate-income persons and members of minority groups.”  Id. § 5318(a)–(b).  \n2 86.  Congress has authorized the HUD Secretary to promulgate “rules and regulations” \n3 necessary to carrying out the Secretary’s “functions, powers, and duties.”  42 U.S.C. § 3535(d). \n4 87.  Pursuant to this authority, HUD has promulgated the CDBG program rule at 24 C.F.R. \n5 part 570 (the “CDBG Rule”), which, among other things, imposes additional restrictions on the use of \n6 CDBG funds.  See 24 C.F.R. § 570.207.  The CDBG Rule also obligates grant recipients to submit \n7 annual consolidated plans in accordance with 24 C.F.R. part 91. 24 C.F.R. § 570.302.  These annual \n8 consolidated plans must include additional certifications enumerated in HUD regulations, including that \n9 the recipient complies with lead-based paint procedures and has policies barring the use of excessive \n10 force against non-violent civil rights demonstrators.  24 C.F.R. § 91.225. \n11 88.  The CDBG Rule does not impose any conditions on CDBG funding related to prohibiting \n12 all forms of DEI policies and initiatives, participating in immigration enforcement, verification of \n13 immigration status, opposing transgender acceptance, or cutting off access to information about lawful \n14 abortions. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 e.  Congress Appropriates CDBG Grant Funding \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 89.  Funding for CDBG grants comes from congressional discretionary appropriations. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 90.  Most recently, Congress appropriated funds for the CDBG program in the 2024 \nN\nN\nE 18 Appropriations Act.  The 2024 Appropriations Act contains additional directives to HUD regarding \nR\n19 CDBG funding.  For instance, it requires that no more than 20% of any grant under the CDBG program \n20 may be expended for certain planning and administrative purposes and imposes limitations on funds \n21 provided to for-profit entities.  138 Stat. 358–59. \n22 91.  None of the 2024 Appropriations Act’s directives to HUD or any other legislation \n23 authorize HUD to impose CDBG grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating \n24 enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \n25 “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n26\n27\n28\n    -22-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 23 of 108\n1 3.  Emergency Solutions Grant Program \n2 a.  Congress Authorizes the Establishment of the Emergency Solutions \n3 Grant Program Through the HEARTH Act \n4 92.  In 2009, Congress established the Emergency Solutions Grant (“ESG”) program through \n5 the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (“HEARTH”) Act, Pub. L. 111-\n6 22, 123 Stat. 1663.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 11371–11378.  In enacting the HEARTH Act, Congress sought to \n7 remedy the “lack of affordable housing and limited scale of housing assistance programs” that it found to \n8 be “the primary causes of homelessness” and “establish a Federal goal of ensuring that individuals and \n9 families who become homeless return to permanent housing within 30 days.”  HEARTH Act, § 1002, \n10 123 Stat. 1664. 317.   \n11 93.  The HEARTH Act amended the Homeless Assistance Act to expand what had been \n12 known as the Emergency Shelter Grant program, which provided formula funding to state and local \n13 governments for the short-term needs of homeless individuals.  Reflecting a broadened focus on factors \n14 that lead to homelessness, the HEARTH Act expanded the activities eligible for funding under the new \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 ESG program to include short- or medium-term rental assistance and housing relocation and stabilization \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 services, in addition to emergency shelters, homelessness prevention, and supportive services, which had \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 been covered under the original program.  See 42 U.S.C. § 11374(a). \nN\nN\nE 18 94.  The Homeless Assistance Act, as amended by the HEARTH Act, directs the Secretary of \nR\n19 HUD to award ESG grants to cities, urban counties, and states on a non-competitive basis using HUD’s \n20 formula for allocating CDBG funds, discussed above.  42 U.S.C. §§ 11372, 11373(a).  These grants fund \n21 programs that address the most critical and immediate needs of those experiencing or at risk of \n22 homelessness, including programs for preventing homelessness, immediately rehousing individuals who \n23 become homeless, and providing emergency shelter to those experiencing homelessness.  Id. § 11374(a). \n24 b.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directive, and HUD Promulgates Rules, \n25 Regarding ESG Grant Conditions  \n26 95.  HUD’s administration of the ESG program, including the award of ESG funds, is \n27 authorized and governed by statutory directives.  Congress has specified what activities are eligible for \n28 funding under the ESG program, the responsibilities of ESG recipients, and specific certifications ESG \n    -23-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 24 of 108\n1 recipients must agree to as a condition of receiving funds.  42 U.S.C. §§ 11374(a), 11375. \n2 96.  Congress’s overarching direction to HUD to award ESG grants is codified at 42 U.S.C. \n3 § 11372, which provides: \n4 The Secretary shall make grants to States and local governments (and to \nprivate nonprofit organizations providing assistance to persons \n5 experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, in the case of grants \nmade with reallocated amounts) for the purpose of carrying out activities \n6 described in section 11374 of this title.  \n7 97.  Section 11374 of Title 42 limits the activities for which ESG funds may be used to \n8 specific services: maintaining, operating, or renovating emergency shelters; providing supportive \n9 services related to emergency shelter or street outreach; paying short- or medium-term rental assistance; \n10 and providing housing relocation or stabilization services for homeless or at-risk individuals and \n11 families. \n12 98.  Section 11375 of Title 42 sets forth certifications that recipients must make to the \n13 Secretary of HUD regarding their use of ESG funds.  Recipients must certify that, among other things, \n14 they will operate facilities that receive funding as homeless shelters for a specified number of years, any \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 ESG-funded renovation will be sufficient to ensure the shelter is safe and sanitary, they will assist \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 homeless individuals in obtaining permanent housing and services such as medical and mental health \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 treatment and counseling, and they will involve homeless individuals and families through employment, \nN\nN\nE 18 volunteer services, or otherwise, in constructing and operating shelters to the maximum extent \nR\n19 practicable. 42 U.S.C. § 11375(c). \n20 99.  The HEARTH Act does not authorize HUD to condition ESG funding on prohibiting all \n21 forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or \n22 prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n23 100.  Section 11376 of Title 42 authorizes the Secretary of HUD “by notice” to “establish such \n24 requirements as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of” the ESG program.  “Such requirements \n25 shall be subject to section 553 of title 5,” which requires rulemaking to occur pursuant to notice and \n26 comment procedures.  42 U.S.C. § 11376.  \n27 101.  Pursuant to this authority, HUD has promulgated the ESG Rule at 24 C.F.R. part 576, \n28 which sets forth additional requirements and conditions on ESG funding.  See 24 C.F.R. §§ 576.400–\n    -24-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 25 of 108\n1 576.409.  For instance, the ESG Rule requires ESG recipients to meet minimum safety, sanitation, and \n2 privacy standards for emergency shelters; integrate ESG services with other programs targeted to \n3 homeless individuals in the area; coordinate with local Continuums; conduct initial evaluations of \n4 program participants consistent with HUD requirements; and abide by recordkeeping and reporting \n5 requirements.  Id. §§ 576.400, 576.401, 576.403(b), 576.500.  \n6 102.  The ESG Rule also obligates ESG recipients to submit and obtain HUD approval of a \n7 consolidated plan in accordance with the requirements in 24 C.F.R. part 91.  Id. § 576.200. HUD’s \n8 consolidated planning regulations set forth additional certifications that must be included in a \n9 consolidated plan, including that the jurisdiction will affirmatively further fair housing, is in compliance \n10 with anti-lobbying requirements, and possesses the legal authority to carry out programs for which it is \n11 seeking funding, among other certifications.  Id. § 91.225(a). \n12 103.  Neither the ESG Rule nor HUD’s consolidated planning regulations impose any \n13 conditions on ESG funding related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \n14 immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 ideology” or “elective abortion.”  Congress has not delegated authority that would permit an agency to \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 adopt such conditions.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 104.  Funding for the ESG program comes from congressional discretionary appropriations. \nN\nN\nE 18 105.  Most recently, Congress appropriated funds for the ESG program in the 2024 \nR\n19 Appropriations Act, 138 Stat. at 362.  \n20 106.  Nothing in the 2024 Appropriations Act or any other legislation authorizes HUD to \n21 impose ESG grant fund conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of \n22 federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n23 ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n24 4.  HOME Investment Partnerships Program \n25 107.  Congress established the HOME program through the HOME Investment Partnerships \n26 Act (HOME Act), under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (“NAHA”), \n27 Pub. L. No. 101–625, 104 Stat. 4079, and subsequent amendments.  The HOME program is a formula \n28 grant program that aims to help state and local governments implement local housing strategies to \n    -25-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 26 of 108\n1 increase affordable housing opportunities for low-income families.  The HOME program requires the \n2 HUD Secretary “to make funds available to participating jurisdictions for investment to increase the \n3 number of families served with decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing and expand the long-term \n4 supply of affordable housing.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 12741, 12747(b). \n5 108.  Participating jurisdictions may use HOME grants for a variety of housing activities.  \n6 These include providing “incentives to develop and support affordable rental housing and \n7 homeownership affordability through the acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, or moderate or \n8 substantial rehabilitation of affordable housing.”  42 U.S.C. § 12742(a)(1).  \n9 109.  Participating jurisdictions must allocate matching funds to affordable housing projects \n10 equivalent to at least 25 percent of the HOME funds the jurisdictions use.  42 U.S.C. § 12750. \n11 a.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and HUD Promulgates Rules, \n12 Regarding HOME Grant Conditions \n13 110.  HUD’s administration of the HOME program is authorized and governed by statutory \n14 directives.  The HOME Act specifies the eligibility requirements to become a participating jurisdiction, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 the permissible and prohibited uses of HOME funds, the maximum incomes of families who may receive \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 HOME funds, and what housing qualifies as affordable for purposes of the program.  42 U.S.C. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 §§ 12742, 12744, 12475, 12476. \nN\nN\nE 18 111.  The HOME Act does not grant HUD discretion in designating which jurisdictions may \nR\n19 participate and under what circumstances those jurisdictions shall receive HOME funds.  It instead \n20 directs the HUD Secretary to establish by regulation the statutorily specified procedures with which \n21 states and local governments must comply to be designated as participating jurisdictions and receive \n22 allocations of HOME funds.  42 U.S.C. § 12746.  The HOME Act provides that such regulations “shall \n23 only provide for the” requirements for allocation, eligibility, notification, submission, reallocation, \n24 revocation, and reduction of funds listed in the statute.  Id. § 12746(1)–(10) (emphasis added).  Once a \n25 jurisdiction meets the statutory formula and complies with the listed requirements, HUD “shall \n26 designate” it “a participating jurisdiction” and the jurisdiction “shall remain a participating jurisdiction \n27 for subsequent fiscal years” unless certain revocation conditions are met.  Id. § 12746(7)–(8) (emphasis \n28 added). \n    -26-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 27 of 108\n1 112.  The HOME Act further directs the HUD Secretary to “establish by regulation an \n2 allocation formula that reflects each jurisdiction’s share of total need among eligible jurisdiction[s] for an \n3 increased supply of affordable housing for very low-income and low-income families of different size.”  \n4 42 U.S.C. § 12747(b)(1)(A).  This formula must be based on the “objective measures” specified in the \n5 HOME Act.  Id. \n6 113.  The Home Act further directs the HUD Secretary to establish a HOME Investment Trust \n7 Fund for each participating jurisdiction, along with a line of credit that includes the participating \n8 jurisdiction’s allocated HOME funds.  42 U.S.C. § 12748(a)–(b). \n9 114.  As directed by Congress, HUD promulgated the HOME program rule at 24 C.F.R. part 92 \n10 (the “HOME Rule”).  The HOME Rule implements the allocation formula prescribed by Congress, along \n11 with the eligibility and related requirements listed in the HOME Act.  See, e.g., 24 C.F.R. §§ 92.50, \n12 92.102–07, 92.150, 92.200–22.  The HOME Rule also lists other federal requirements with which \n13 participating jurisdictions must comply, including the nondiscrimination requirements that apply to all \n14 HUD Programs, listed at 24 C.F.R. § 5.105(a), as well as the nondiscrimination requirements in the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 HOME Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12832, addressed below.  24 C.F.R. § 92.350. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 115.  Neither Congress nor HUD’s regulations authorize HUD to condition HOME funding on \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of \nN\nN\nE 18 immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \nR\n19 116.  NAHA and the HOME Act indicate congressional intent to benefit historically \n20 disadvantaged groups.  One of Congress’s objectives in enacting NAHA was to “improve housing \n21 opportunities for all residents of the United States, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities, on \n22 a nondiscriminatory basis.”  42 U.S.C. § 12702(3).  The HOME Act requires participating jurisdictions \n23 “to establish and oversee a minority outreach program . . . to ensure the inclusion, to the maximum extent \n24 possible, of minorities and women, and entities owned by minorities and women . . . in all contracts[] \n25 entered into by the participating jurisdiction . . . to provide affordable housing authorized under this Act.”  \n26 Id. § 12831(a).  The HOME Act also forbids participating jurisdictions from denying benefits to or \n27 otherwise discriminating against any person “on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion, or \n28 sex.”  Id. § 12832. \n    -27-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 28 of 108\n1 117.  In January 2025, HUD issued a final rule amending the HOME Rule “to update, simplify, \n2 or streamline requirements, better align the program with other Federal housing programs, and \n3 implement recent amendments to the HOME statute.”  HOME Investment Partnerships Program: \n4 Program Updates and Streamlining, 90 Fed. Reg. 746, 746 (Jan. 6, 2025).  The revised HOME Rule does \n5 not add any grant conditions related to DEI, immigration enforcement, verification of immigration status, \n6 “gender ideology,” or abortion.  The revised HOME Rule was originally set to become effective \n7 February 5, 2025, but HUD delayed parts of the Rule until October 2025.  HOME Investment \n8 Partnerships Program: Program Updates and Streamlining—Delay of Effective Date, Withdrawal, and \n9 Correction, 90 Fed. Reg. 16085 (Apr. 17, 2025). \n10 b.  Congress Appropriates HOME Grant Finding   \n11 118.  Funding for the HOME program comes from congressional discretionary appropriations. \n12 119.  Most recently, Congress appropriated $1,250,000,000 for the HOME program in the 2024 \n13 Appropriations Act. 38 Stat. 360.  The 2024 Appropriations Act contains additional directives to HUD \n14 regarding HOME funding.  For instance, it extends the statutory deadline for participating jurisdictions to \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 draw funds from their HOME Investment Trust Fund.  Id. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 120.  None of the 2024 Appropriations Act’s directives to HUD or any other legislation \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 authorize HUD to impose HOME grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating \nN\nN\nE 18 enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \nR\n19 “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n20 5.  The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program \n21 121.  Congress established the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (“HOPWA”) \n22 program through the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act, Subtitle D of Title VIII of NAHA, Pub. L. No. \n23 101–625, 104 Stat. 4079, and subsequent amendments.  The objective of the HOPWA program is “to \n24 provide States and localities with the resources and incentives to devise long-term comprehensive \n25 strategies for meeting the housing needs of persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and \n26 families of such persons.”  42 U.S.C. § 12901.  To meet this aim, the program authorizes formula grants \n27 and competitively awarded grants to provide housing assistance and related supportive services to meet \n28 the housing needs of low-income persons living with HIV or AIDS and their families. \n    -28-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 29 of 108\n1 122.  The HOPWA program permits grant recipients to use HOPWA funds for a number of \n2 housing programs for persons living with HIV or AIDS, including providing information and services, \n3 short-term housing, rental assistance, development of single room occupancy dwellings, and \n4 development and operation of community residences.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12906–910. \n5 123.  Ninety percent of HOPWA funds must be allocated pursuant to a statutory formula based \n6 on total population, the number of persons living with HIV or AIDS, fair market rents, and poverty data.  \n7 42 U.S.C. § 12903(c)(1)(A).  The HUD Secretary must award the remaining 10 percent of grant funds on \n8 a competitive basis to states and local governments not eligible for a formula grant, or to states, local \n9 governments, or nonprofits seeking funding for “special projects of national significance.”  Id. \n10 § 12903(c)(5)(A), (C). \n11 a.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and HUD Promulgates Rules \n12 Regarding HOPWA Grant Conditions \n13 124.  To be eligible for HOPWA funds, states and local governments must submit an \n14 application for the HUD Secretary’s approval.  42 U.S.C. § 12903(d).  Congress instructed the HUD \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Secretary to establish by regulation procedures for the submission of applications using specified \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 requirements.  Id. § 12903(d)(1)–(6).  Congress also permitted the HUD Secretary to require “other \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 information or certifications” but only to the extent “necessary to achieve the purposes of this section,” \nN\nN\nE 18 i.e., to award formula and competitive grants pursuant to the statutorily listed criteria.  Id. § 12903(d)(6). \nR\n19 125.  Pursuant to this authority, HUD promulgated the HOPWA program rule at 24 C.F.R. part \n20 574 (the “HOPWA Rule”).  The HOPWA Rule implements the allocation formula prescribed in the \n21 statute, as well as the permissible uses of HOPWA funds.  24 C.F.R. §§ 574.110, 130, 300.  The Rule \n22 also creates an application process for competitive grants, requiring applications “comply with the \n23 provisions of the Department’s Notice of Funding Availability (“NOFA”) for the fiscal year.”  Id. \n24 § 574.240.  The HOPWA Rule also sets out conditions grantees and project sponsors must agree to, \n25 including compliance with HUD regulations and “such other terms and conditions . . . as HUD may \n26 establish for purposes of carrying out the program in an effective and efficient manner.”  Id. § 574.500 \n27 (emphasis added).  The HOPWA Rule further lists other federal requirements with which participating \n28 jurisdictions must comply, including the nondiscrimination requirements that apply to all HUD programs \n    -29-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 30 of 108\n1 listed at 24 C.F.R. § 5.105(a).  24 C.F.R. § 574.603. \n2 126.  Neither NAHA nor the HOPWA Rule permit HUD to condition HOPWA funding on \n3 prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of \n4 immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n5 127.  As discussed above, NAHA, which established the HOPWA program, indicates \n6 congressional intent to benefit historically disadvantaged groups, including the aim to “improve housing \n7 opportunities for . . . members of disadvantaged minorities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12702(3). \n8 b.  Congress Appropriates HOPWA Grant Funding \n9 128.  Funding for HOPWA grants comes from congressional discretionary appropriations.  See \n10 42 U.S.C. § 12912. \n11 129.  Most recently, Congress appropriated $505,000,000 for the HOPWA program in the 2024 \n12 Appropriations Act.  38 Stat. 358.  The 2024 Appropriations Act contains additional directives to HUD \n13 regarding HOPWA funding.  For instance, it instructs HUD to “renew or replace all expiring contracts \n14 for permanent supportive housing . . . before awarding funds for new contracts.”  Id. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 130.  None of the 2024 Appropriations Act’s directives to HUD or any other legislation \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 authorize HUD to impose HOPWA grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \nN\nN\nE 18 “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  \nR\n19 6.  Other HUD Grants \n20 131.  HUD and its program offices administer a range of other competitive and formula grant \n21 programs that some plaintiffs have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to \n22 receive.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on \n23 these other HUD grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of \n24 immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n25 ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n26 132.  Congress annually appropriates funding for HUD grant programs.  In the annual \n27 appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the Secretary of HUD with \n28 respect to funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \n    -30-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 31 of 108\n1 conditions on HUD grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of \n2 immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n3 ideology” or “elective abortion.” See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 \n4 Stat. 1865–1902; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, 136 Stat. 725–766; \n5 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. 117-328, 136 Stat 5138–5181; Consolidated \n6 Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 344–386. \n7 133.  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Eureka, City of Saint Paul, City of Alameda, City of \n8 Redwood City, County of Monroe, County of Marin, County of San Diego, and County of Sacramento, \n9 (collectively the “HUD Plaintiffs”) have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible \n10 to receive HUD grants, including CoC grants, CDBG grants, ESG grants, HOME grants, HOPWA \n11 grants, and/or other HUD grant funding.  These Plaintiffs rely on millions of dollars in appropriated \n12 federal funds from HUD grant programs.  \n13 134.  The HUD Plaintiffs rely on HUD block grant programs, including the block programs \n14 described above (CDBG, ESG, HOME, and HOPWA), to provide decent, affordable housing and a \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 suitable living environment, and to increase economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 persons throughout their jurisdictions.  The programs that these grants support are extensive and \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 essential.  These funds are used for programs like the creation and preservation of affordable rental \nN\nN\nE 18 housing, homeownership rehabilitation and weatherization, food banks, childcare and afterschool \nR\n19 programs, community development capital improvements, home weatherization, and job training \n20 programs.  They help those plaintiffs provide basic needs services, including food distribution, basic \n21 chore assistance for homebound seniors and disabled persons, support for children who have experienced \n22 violence or neglect, and domestic violence prevention for the benefit of low-income individuals and \n23 households.  They also help those plaintiffs provide housing services, including rental assistance, housing \n24 case management, downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and capital development for \n25 affordable housing to benefit low-income individuals and households and to create affordable housing, \n26 provide rental assistance, and address homelessness in the region.  They help prevent and address \n27 homelessness, including by supporting emergency shelter services.   \n28\n    -31-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 32 of 108\n1 B.  DOT Grant Programs \n2 135.  Congress established DOT in 1966 “to assure the coordinated, effective administration of \n3 the transportation programs of the Federal Government.”  Department of 4 Transportation Act, 1966, \n4 Pub. L. 89-670, 80 Stat. 931.  DOT administers both competitive and entitlement (sometimes referred to \n5 as formula) grant programs.  Competitive grant programs “allocate[] a limited pool of funds to state and \n6 local applicants whose applications are approved by” a federal agency.  City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 \n7 F.3d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir. 2019).  In administering grant programs, DOT manages certain grant programs \n8 centrally through the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST).  However, DOT often acts through \n9 its operating administrations, including the FTA, FHWA, FAA, and FRA.  By law, the DOT Secretary is \n10 responsible for all acts taken by its operating administrations.  The administrators of the FTA, FHWA, \n11 FAA, and FRA report directly to the DOT Secretary.  49 U.S.C. § 103(b), (d), (g)(1) (FRA); id. \n12 §§ 104(b)(1), (c)(1) (FHWA); id. §§ 106(b)(1)(E), (f)(3)(A) (FAA); id. §§ 107(b), (c) (FTA); see also 49 \n13 C.F.R. Part 1 (organization and authority of DOT). \n14 136.  Congress has established by statute a wide variety of grant programs administered by \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 DOT centrally through the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (“OST”).  This includes, but is not \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 limited to, the Innovative Finance and Asset Concession (“IFAC”) Grant Program.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 137.  Section 71001 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act created an asset concession \nN\nN\nE 18 program.  The Act directs the DOT Secretary to establish a program to facilitate access to expert services \nR\n19 and to provide grants to states, tribes, and local governments to enhance the technical capacity of eligible \n20 entities and facilitate and evaluate public-private partnerships for transportation infrastructure projects, \n21 including through asset concessions.  23 U.S.C. § 611(b).  The Act requires appropriation of $100 million \n22 over five years to fund IFAC grants.  IFAC grants are awarded on a competitive basis.  \n23 138.  Congress must annually authorize $20,000,000 to be made available for IFAC grants until \n24 expended.  23 U.S.C. § 611(g)(2).  In the annual appropriation legislation, Congress sets forth priorities \n25 and directives to the DOT Secretary with respect to transportation funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of \n26 Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on IFAC grants related to a \n27 prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of immigration laws, verification of \n28 immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”.  See, \n    -32-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 33 of 108\n1 e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1826; Consolidated \n2 Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117- 103, 136 Stat. 687; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. \n3 L. 117-328, 136 Stat. 5097; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 301. \n4 139.  Plaintiff the City of Saint Paul has been awarded an IFAC grant and is currently in the is \n5 in the post-award phase of negotiating with DOT the terms and conditions of the Cooperative Agreement \n6 for the disbursement of funds. Saint Paul is relying on $805,000 in awarded federal funds from DOT to \n7 identify assets that can provide opportunities for public-private partnership and increase the efficiency of \n8 the City’s public transit system.  \n9 1.  FTA Grant Programs  \n10 140.  Congress has established by statute a wide variety of grant programs administered by \n11 DOT, acting through the FTA, that provide federal funds to state and local governments for public transit \n12 services.  These include, but are not limited to, programs codified in title 49, chapter 53 of the U.S. Code, \n13 as amended by the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act of 2015, Pub. L. 114-94, 129 \n14 Stat. 1312, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 141.  For instance, section 5307 authorizes the Secretary of DOT (the “DOT Secretary”) to \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 make urbanized area formula grants (“UA Formula Grants”), which go toward funding the operating \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 costs of public transit facilities and equipment in urban areas, as well as certain capital, planning, and \nN\nN\nE 18 other transit-related projects.  See 49 U.S.C. § 5307(a)(1).  Section 5307 imposes specific requirements \nR\n19 on UA Formula Grant recipients related to the recipient’s operation and control of public transit systems.  \n20 See id. § 5307(c).  None of these requirements pertain to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or facilitating \n21 the enforcement of federal immigration laws.   \n22 142.  Section 5309 establishes certain fixed guideway capital investment grants (“Fixed \n23 Guideway Grants”).  See 49 U.S.C. § 5309(b).  This program funds certain state and local government \n24 projects that develop and improve “fixed guideway” systems—meaning public transit systems that \n25 operate on a fixed right-of-way, such as rail, passenger ferry, or bus rapid transit systems.  Id. \n26 §§ 5302(8), 5309(b).  Section 5309 imposes specific requirements on Fixed Guideway Grant recipients \n27 related to, for example, the recipient’s capacity to carry out the project, maintain its equipment and \n28 facilities, and achieve budget, cost, and ridership outcomes.  See id. § 5309(c).  None of these \n    -33-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 34 of 108\n1 requirements pertain to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or facilitating the enforcement of federal \n2 immigration laws. \n3 143.  Section 5337 authorizes grants to fund state and local government capital projects that \n4 maintain public transit systems in a state of good repair, as well as competitive grants for replacement of \n5 rail rolling stock (“Repair Grants”).  See 49 U.S.C. § 5337(b), (f).  Section 5337 specifically limits what \n6 projects may be eligible for Repair Grants, id. § 5337(b), and imposes specific requirements on multi-\n7 year agreements for competitive rail vehicle replacement grants, id. § 5337(f)(7).  It does not, however, \n8 impose any conditions on Repair Grants related to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or facilitating the \n9 enforcement of federal immigration laws. \n10 144.  Section 5339 authorizes grants to fund the purchase and maintenance of buses and bus \n11 facilities (“Bus Grants”).  See 49 U.S.C. § 5339(a)(2), (b), (c).  The Bus Grant program incorporates the \n12 specific funding requirements set forth in section 5307 for UA Formula Grants and imposes other \n13 requirements on Bus Grant recipients.  See id. § 5339(a)(3), (7), (b)(6), (c)(3).  Section 5339 does not, \n14 however, impose any conditions on Bus Grants related to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or local \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 participation in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 145.  Congress annually appropriates funding for FTA grant programs, including the programs \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 identified above.  In the annual appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to \nN\nN\nE 18 the DOT Secretary with respect to transportation funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever \nR\n19 imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on FTA grants related to a prohibition on all forms of \n20 DEI, facilitating enforcement of immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \n21 “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n22 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1182, 1854; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, \n23 136 Stat. 716, 724; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub.

FHWA Grant Programs  \n3 147.  Congress has established by statute a variety of grant programs administered by DOT, \n4 acting through the FHWA, that provide federal funds to state and local governments for road and street \n5 infrastructure projects.  These include, but are not limited to, programs codified in title 23 of the U.S. \n6 Code and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429. \n7 148.  For instance, Section 24112(b) of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, established \n8 Safe Streets and Roads for All, or SS4A, a competitive grant program that provides funding for \n9 improving roadway safety through the development, refinement, and subsequent implementation of \n10 comprehensive safety action plans.  135 Stat. 815–817.  The Act requires the DOT Secretary to consider, \n11 among other things, the extent to which applicants and their proposed projects will ensure “equitable \n12 investment in the safety needs of underserved communities in preventing transportation-related fatalities \n13 and injuries” and “achieve[] such other conditions as the Secretary considers to be necessary.”  See id. \n14 § 24112(c)(3).  None of these considerations pertain to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or facilitating \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 the enforcement of federal immigration laws. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 149.  In February 2024, DOT posted a Notice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”)—which it \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 updated in April 2024—announcing a competition for SS4A grant funding for Fiscal Year 2024 (the “FY \nN\nN\nE 18 2024 SS4A NOFO”).

The FY 2024 SS4A NOFO directed applicants to consider policy priorities in their \n22 applications, including “Equity and Barriers to Opportunity” and “Climate Change and Environmental \n23 Justice.”  Id. at 39; see also id. at 27, 29 (listing “Equity” as a selection criterion for grants).  The FY \n24 2024 SS4A NOFO specified that “[e]ach applicant selected for SS4A grant funding must demonstrate \n25 effort to improve equity and reduce barriers to opportunity as described in Section A” and stated “the \n26 Department seeks to award funds under the SS4A grant program that will create proportional impacts to \n27 all populations in a project area, remove transportation related disparities to all populations in a project \n28 area, and increase equitable access to project benefits.”  Id. at 12, 39.  \n    -35-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 36 of 108\n1 151.   The FY 2024 SS4A NOFO strongly emphasized equity considerations throughout.  The \n2 NOFO defined “equity” as “[t]he consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all \n3 individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such \n4 treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific \n5 Islanders, and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, \n6 transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and \n7 persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.”  Id. at 4.  The NOFO did not \n8 include any grant conditions related to prohibiting all kinds of DEI or facilitating the enforcement of \n9 federal immigration laws. \n10 152.  In addition to SS4A, FHWA administers the Federal Highway-Aid Program, which \n11 provides federal formula funding for the construction, maintenance and operation of the country’s 3.9-\n12 million-mile highway network, including the Interstate Highway System, primary highways, and \n13 secondary local roads. \n14 153.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorized $356.5 billion for fiscal years 2022 \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 through 2026 to be used for the Federal Highway-Aid Program.  Currently, there are nine core formula \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 funding programs within the Federal Highway-Aid Program: the National Highway Performance \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Program, 23 U.S.C. § 119; the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (“STBG”), 23 U.S.C. § 133; \nN\nN\nE 18 the Highway Safety Improvement Program (“HSIP”), 23 U.S.C. § 148 and 23 C.F.R. Part 924; the \nR\n19 Railway-Highway Crossings Program, 23 U.S.C. § 130 and 23 C.F.R. Part 924; the Congestion \n20 Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (“CMAQ”), 23 U.S.C. § 149; the Metropolitan \n21 Planning Program, 23 U.S.C. § 104(d); the National Highway Freight Program, 23 U.S.C. § 167; the \n22 Carbon Reduction Program, 23 U.S.C. § 175; and the PROTECT Formula Program, 23 U.S.C. § 176.  \n23 None of these statutes authorizes DOT or FHWA to impose a prohibition on DEI or a requirement to \n24 facilitate the enforcement of federal immigration laws as a precondition to receiving federal grants.  \n25 154.  Section 11118 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act created the Bridge \n26 Investment Program (BIP) to assist states, tribes, and local governments with rehabilitating or replacing \n27 bridges to improve safety and efficiency for people and freight moving across bridges.  23 U.S.C. \n28 § 124(b)(2).  The Act directs the DOT Secretary to consider factors such as cost considerations, safety \n    -36-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 37 of 108\n1 benefits, and mobility improvements.  Id. §§ 124(f)(3)(B); (g)(4)(B).  No part of the BIP’s authorizing \n2 language describes immigration enforcement or ending DEI as considerations for the grant.  \n3 155.  Section 21203 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act created the National Culvert \n4 Removal, Replacement, and Restoration Grant Program, also known as the Culvert Aquatic Organism \n5 Passage Program (“Culvert AOP Program”) to assist states, tribes, and local governments with projects \n6 that would meaningfully improve or restore passage for anadromous fish (species that are born in \n7 freshwater such as streams and rivers, spend most of their lives in the 19 marine environment, and \n8 migrate back to freshwater to spawn).  49 U.S.C. § 6703.  The Act directs the DOT Secretary to prioritize \n9 projects that would improve fish passage for certain categories of anadromous fish stocks or that would \n10 open more than 200 meters of upstream habitat before the end of the natural habitat.  Id. § 6703(e).  The \n11 FHWA administers some Culvert AOP Program grants on behalf of DOT.  No part of the Culvert AOP \n12 Program’s authorizing language describes immigration enforcement or ending DEI as considerations for \n13 the grant. \n14 156.  The FHWA also administers the FY 2023-24 Advanced Transportation Technology and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Innovation (ATTAIN) grant program, as directed by Congress in 23 U.S.C. § 503(c)(4).  Section \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 503(c)(4) directs the DOT Secretary to provide grants “to deploy, install, and operate advanced \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 transportation technologies to improve safety, mobility, efficiency, system performance, intermodal \nN\nN\nE 18 connectivity, and infrastructure return on investment.”  The DOT Secretary was directed to develop \nR\n19 selection criteria that included an enumerated list of considerations, including how the deployment of \n20 technology would “improve the mobility of people and goods,” “protect the environment and deliver \n21 environmental benefits that alleviate congestion and streamline traffic flow,” and “reduce the number and \n22 severity of traffic crashes and increase driver, passenger, and pedestrian safety.”  Id.  Nothing in the \n23 statutory provisions authorizing the ATTAIN grant program describes immigration enforcement or \n24 ending DEI as considerations for the grant. \n25 157.  In fulfillment of the statutory authorization of FHWA grant programs, including the ones \n26 identified above, Congress annually appropriates funding for FHWA grants.  In appropriations \n27 legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the DOT Secretary with respect to \n28 transportation funding, but Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives \n    -37-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 38 of 108\n1 for or conditions on FHWA grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement \n2 of immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n3 ideology” or “elective abortion.”  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 19 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, \n4 134 Stat. 1835–1842; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117- 103, 136 Stat. 697–705; \n5 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. 117-328, 136 Stat. 5109– 5117; Consolidated \n6 Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 315–324.  \n7 158.  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Eureka, City of Saint Paul, City of Alameda, County of \n8 Marin, County of San Diego, and County of Sacramento (collectively, the “FHWA Plaintiffs”) have \n9 previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive FHWA grants.  These \n10 Plaintiffs rely on millions of dollars in appropriated federal funds from FHWA direct or pass-through \n11 grant programs for transportation-related projects undertaken for the benefit of their communities. \n12 3.  FAA Grant Program \n13 159.  Congress has established by statute a variety of grant programs administered by DOT, \n14 acting through the FAA, that provide federal funds to public agencies for planning and development of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 airports.  These include, but are not limited to, programs codified in title 49 of the U.S. Code, as well as \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 160.  For instance, the Airport Improvement Program (“AIP”) is codified under title 49, chapter \nN\nN\nE 18 471 of the U.S. Code.  Under the AIP, the DOT Secretary is authorized to make formula and \nR\n19 discretionary grants to recipients (referred to as “sponsors”) for the planning and development of certain \n20 public-use airports.  49 U.S.C. 47101 et seq.  The DOT Secretary may approve AIP grant applications \n21 only if the sponsor and project meet certain statutory requirements.  For example, requiring consistency \n22 with plans for development of the surrounding area, financial capacity, and ability to complete the project \n23 “without unreasonable delay,” and only if the sponsor makes certain written assurances based on the type \n24 of grant at issue, such as “the airport will be available for public use on reasonable conditions and \n25 without unjust discrimination” and “the airport and facilities on or connected with the airport will be \n26 operated and maintained suitably, with consideration given to climatic and flood conditions”.  49 U.S.C. \n27 §§ 47106, 47107. \n28\n    -38-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 39 of 108\n1 161.  Congress has been precise in the requirements that attach to grant recipients and has set \n2 those forth in statute, which has been implemented by DOT through contractual “Grant Assurances” that \n3 are terms of every grant agreement.  None of the statutory requirements pertain to a prohibition on DEI \n4 or a requirement of local participation in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. \n5 162.  AIP funding levels are established periodically by reauthorization acts, such as the FAA \n6 Reauthorization Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-254, 132 Stat. 3186, and the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, \n7 Pub. L. 118-63, 138 Stat. 1025.  The reauthorization acts define the AIP authorization levels, amend the \n8 various AIP statutes, and set out directives to the DOT Secretary with respect to airport improvement \n9 funding, but they do not impose or authorize directives for or conditions on AIP grants related to a \n10 prohibition on DEI or requirement of local participation in federal immigration enforcement.   \n11 163.  Similarly, the Airport Infrastructure Grants (“AIG”) program is authorized under the \n12 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 1416–1418.  Under the AIG \n13 program, the DOT Secretary is authorized to make formula and discretionary grants for runways, \n14 taxiways, airport safety and sustainability projects, as well as terminal, airport transit connections, and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 roadway projects.  Grants made under the AIG program are treated as having been made pursuant to the \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 DOT Secretary’s authority for project grants issued under the AIP statute.  135 Stat. 1417–1418.  The \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act sets forth the AIG funding levels but does not impose any \nN\nN\nE 18 conditions on AIG grants related to prohibitions on DEI or the requirement of local participation in the \nR\n19 enforcement of federal immigration laws.   \n20 164.  In fulfillment of the statutory authorization of FAA grant programs, including the ones \n21 identified above, Congress annually appropriates funding for FAA grants.  In the annual appropriations \n22 legislation, Congress sets forth additional priorities and directives to the DOT Secretary with respect to \n23 transportation funding, but Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing directives for or conditions \n24 on FAA grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of immigration laws, \n25 verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective \n26 abortion.”  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1830–1835, \n27 1939–1941; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, 136 Stat. 691–697; Consolidated \n28 Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. 117-328, 136 Stat. 5101–5108; Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n    -39-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 40 of 108\n1 2024, Pub. L. 118- 42, 138 Stat. 307–314. \n2 165.  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of South Lake Tahoe, County of Marin, County of San \n3 Diego, County of Sacramento, County of Monroe, and Monroe Airport Authority (collectively, the “FAA \n4 Plaintiffs”) have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive FAA grants.  \n5 These Plaintiffs rely on millions of dollars in appropriated federal funds from FAA direct or pass-through \n6 grant programs for transportation-related projects undertaken for the benefit of their communities. \n7 4.  Other DOT Grants  \n8 166.  DOT and its operating administrations administer a range of other competitive and \n9 formula grant programs that some Plaintiffs have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise \n10 eligible to receive.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \n11 conditions on these other DOT grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating \n12 enforcement of immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of \n13 “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n14 167.  Congress annually appropriates funding for DOT grant programs.  In the annual \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the Secretary of DOT with \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 respect to funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 conditions on HUD grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of \nN\nN\nE 18 immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \nR\n19 ideology” or “elective abortion.” See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 \n20 Stat. 1182, 1835–1842, 1854; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, 136 Stat. 697–\n21 705, 716, 724; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. 117-328, 136 Stat. 5109– 5117, 5129, \n22 5138; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118- 42, 138 Stat. 315–324, 334, 342.  \n23 168.  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of South Lake Tahoe, City of Eureka, City of Saint Paul, \n24 City of Alameda, City of Redwood City, County of San Diego, County of Marin, County of Sacramento, \n25 County of Monroe, and Monroe Airport Authority (collectively, the “DOT Plaintiffs”) have previously \n26 received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive DOT grants.  These Plaintiffs rely on \n27 millions of dollars in appropriated federal funds from DOT direct or pass-through grant programs for \n28 transportation-related projects undertaken for the benefit of their communities. \n    -40-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 41 of 108\n1 C.  HHS Grant Programs \n2 169.  Congress established the precursor to HHS—the cabinet-level Department of Health, \n3 Education, and Welfare—in 1953.  After a separate Department of Education was created in 1979, HHS \n4 took its current name.  Today, HHS is the largest grant-making agency in the United States.  It \n5 administers both competitive grant programs and formula and block grant programs that provide funds to \n6 local governments to enhance the health and well-being of their communities.  In administering grant \n7 programs, HHS often acts through its operating divisions and agencies, such as the Centers for Disease \n8 Control and Prevention (“CDC”), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Health \n9 Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n10 Administration (“SAMHSA”), and the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), among others.  See U.S. \n11 Dep’t Health & Hum. Servs., HHS Agencies & Offices, \n12 https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/hhsagencies-and-offices/index.html (last visited June 27, 2025).  \n13 The Secretary of HHS is responsible for overseeing the actions of its operating divisions and agencies.  \n14 See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 290aa (similar for SAMHSA and its head; authority of HHS Secretary); 42 U.S.C. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 § 242c (appointment and authority of CDC Director; functions of HHS Secretary); 42 U.S.C. § 282 \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 (appointment and authority of NIH Director; functions of HHS Secretary); 42 U.S.C. §§ 202–203 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 (organization of Public Health Service, which includes NIH, within HHS); 42 U.S.C. § 1317 \nN\nN\nE 18 (appointment of CMS Administrator); U.S. Dep’t Health & Hum. Servs., Centers for Medicare & \nR\n19 Medicaid Services, 66 Fed. Reg. 35437 (Jul. 5, 2001) (establishing CMS and delegating authority from \n20 HHS Secretary to CMS Administrator).  Some examples of the grants administered by HHS and its \n21 operating divisions and agencies are discussed below. \n22 1.  Health Resources and Services Administration Programs  \n23 170.  The Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) within HHS awards grant \n24 funding to more than 3,000 recipients, including state and local governments, to support health services \n25 projects, such as training health care workers and providing specific health services.  Elayne J. Heisler, \n26 Cong. Rsch. Serv., R46001, HRSA FY2020 President’s Budget Request and Agency Funding History: In \n27 Brief (Nov. 12, 2019).  \n28\n    -41-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 42 of 108\n1 171.  HRSA awards a variety of competitive and formula grants in several program areas, \n2 including Primary Care/Health Centers, Health Workforce Training, HIV/AIDS, Organ Donation, \n3 Maternal and Child Health, Rural Health, and other areas.  Grants, U.S. Dep’t Health & Hum. Servs., \n4 Health Res. & Servs. Admin., https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/grants (last updated May 20, 2025). \n5 172.  Among HRSA’s largest grant programs are the Health Center Program (HCP) and the \n6 Ryan White HIV/AIDS (RWHA) program. \n7 a.  The Health Center Program \n8 173.   Congress authorized the federal HCP program through Section 330 of the Public Health \n9 Service Act (“PHSA”), as amended.  42 U.S.C. § 254b.  The HCP program funds grants to support \n10 qualified outpatient facilities that provide primary care to low-income individuals and other underserved \n11 communities, as specified in the statute. \n12 174.  In particular, the HCP program supports four types of health centers: (1) community \n13 health centers (“CHCs”), (2) health centers for the homeless (“HCHs”), (3) health centers for residents of \n14 public housing, and (4) migrant health centers.  See 42 U.S.C. §254b(a), (g), (h), (i).  The majority of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 these are CHCs, which must provide “primary health services” to medically underserved populations and \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 serve all residents of the CHC’s services area.  Id. § 2549(a).  HCHs provide services to individuals \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 experiencing or at risk of homelessness and are required to provide all services CHCs provide as well as \nN\nN\nE 18 substance abuse treatment.  Id. § 2549(h).  Health centers for residents of public housing are located in, \nR\n19 and offer primary care services to those who reside in or near, public housing facilities.  Id. § 2549(i).  \n20 Finally, migrant health centers provide care to migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their \n21 families.  Id. § 2549(g). \n22 175.  Funding for the HCP program comes from a combination of discretionary funding, \n23 appropriated by Congress each year, and mandatory funding from the Community Health Center Fund.  \n24 By statue, HCH programs receive 8.7% of HCP funds. \n25 176.  In addition to the HCP grants themselves, health centers that receive funding under \n26 Section 330 of the PHSA become eligible for other congressionally authorized benefits.  For instance, \n27 such health centers are eligible for designation as Federally Qualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”), which \n28 entitles them to higher, cost-based Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.  42 U.S.C. \n    -42-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 43 of 108\n1 §§ 1395i(a)(1)(z), 1395m(o), 1395x(aa)(3).  FQHCs may also receive drug discounts under Section 340B \n2 of the PHSA.  Id. § 256b.  \n3 177.  Section 330 of the PHSA sets out numerous requirements that health centers must meet to \n4 ensure that HCP-funded facilities serve as part of a safety net for underserved communities.  In addition \n5 to the requirements set forth above, Congress requires that HCP-funded health centers provide services to \n6 all patients regardless of ability to pay.  42 U.S.C. § 254b(k)(3).  Recipients must therefore have fee \n7 schedules consistent with locally prevailing wages while covering operating costs, and must offer \n8 discounts based on the patient’s ability to pay.  Id. § 254b(k)(3)(G).  They must also be located in areas \n9 or serve populations that the HHS Secretary has designated as “medically underserved.”  Id. \n10 §§ 254b(a)(1), (b)(3), (c)(1), (e)(1)(A).  The statute sets forth additional detailed funding conditions \n11 concerning Medicaid coordination and reimbursement, governance, provision of services, reporting, and \n12 quality assurance.  Id. §§ 254b(b)(1), (k)(3)(C), (F), (H), (I), (q). \n13 178.  Section 330 of the PHSA does not authorize conditions on HCP grants related to \n14 prohibiting DEI in all forms, excluding transgender individuals, denying services to immigrants, or \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 incorporating executive orders unrelated to providing health care to underserved populations. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 179.  The HHS Secretary has promulgated regulations further governing the HCP program at 42 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 C.F.R. parts 51c and 56 (the “HCP Rule”).  Among other things, the HCP Rule sets forth additional \nN\nN\nE 18 limitations on the use of HCP funds, 42 C.F.R. § 51c.107, and enumerates project requirements and \nR\n19 criteria the HHS Secretary will consider in awarding grants based on the purpose of the funds, id. \n20 §§ 51c.203, 51c.204, 51c.303, 51c.305, 51c.403, 51c.404., 51c.504.  For instance, in reviewing proposals \n21 to plan or develop new health centers, the HHS Secretary must consider the relative need of the \n22 population to be served by the proposed project, the health center’s potential for developing new and \n23 effective methods for providing services, and the distribution of resources across the country.  Id. \n24 § 51c.204.  The HCP Rule also sets forth specific requirements for migrant health centers, including a \n25 requirement that they provide specific services to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers’ needs, such \n26 as supportive services, environmental health services, accident prevention, and prevention and treatment \n27 of health conditions related to pesticide exposure.  42 C.F.R. § 56.102(g). \n28\n    -43-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 44 of 108\n1 180.  The HCP Rule does not impose any conditions on HCP grants related to prohibiting DEI \n2 in all forms, excluding transgender individuals, or incorporating executive orders unrelated to providing \n3 health care to underserved populations. \n4 b.  Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program  \n5 181.  In 1990, Congress established the Ryan White HIV/AIDS (“RWHA”) program as part of \n6 the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act, Pub. L. 101-381, 104 Stat. 576, and \n7 has revised and extended it several times, including in the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment \n8 Modernization Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109-415, 120 Stat. 2767, and the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment \n9 Extension Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-87, 123 Stat. 2885.  The program is codified at Title 42, Subchapter \n10 XXIV of the U.S. Code and contains four major parts.  Among these are Part A, which provides grants to \n11 urban areas and mid-sized cities, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300ff-11 to 300ff-20; Part B, which provides grants to \n12 states and territories, id. §§ 300ff-21 to 300ff-38; and Part C, which funds HIV outpatient primary care to \n13 low-income and medically underserved people living with HIV/AIDS, id. §§ 300ff–51 to 300ff–67. \n14 i.  RWHA Part A Program \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 182.  Part A of the RWHA program provides grants for medical and support services to eligible \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 metropolitan areas with high levels of reported AIDS cases in the previous five years.  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-\nBn\nPE UAttor 17 11(a).  HRSA distributes two-thirds of appropriated Part A grants non-competitively to eligible \nN\nN\nE 18 metropolitan areas based on a statutory formula, id. § 300ff-13(a)(2)–(3), and the remaining one-third via \nR\n19 competitive supplemental grants awarded based on the applicant’s demonstrated need, id. § 300ff-13(b).  \n20 With respect to the two-thirds comprised of formula grants, the Secretary has no discretion to withhold \n21 funding and is required to allocate grants based on a formula that considers how many individuals are \n22 living with HIV/AIDS in the jurisdiction.  See id. § 300ff-13(a)(2), (3). \n23 183.  Congress has imposed detailed conditions on RWHA Part A grants. For instance, Part A \n24 grant recipients must spend 75% of awarded funds on “core medical services,” which are defined to \n25 include outpatient/ambulatory medical care services, AIDS pharmaceutical assistance, home health care, \n26 and mental health and substance abuse outpatient services, among others.  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-14(c).  The \n27 remaining Part A funds must go toward “support services,” such as outreach, medical transportation, and \n28 referrals, as well as statutorily permitted administrative expenses.  Id. § 300ff-14(c)(1), (d).  Congress has \n    -44-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 45 of 108\n1 also mandated that grant recipients establish HIV Health Services Planning Councils to set priorities for \n2 care delivery and has prescribed several related requirements.  Id. § 300ff-12(b). \n3 184.  Congress has also enacted statutory factors that HRSA must consider in awarding \n4 competitive supplemental grants to applicants based on demonstrated need.  These include the rates of \n5 HIV/AIDS, impacts of co-morbid factors, and prevalence of homelessness in the applicant’s area.  42 \n6 U.S.C. § 300ff-13(b)(2)(B). \n7 185.  Neither the statutes governing the RWHA Part A program nor any other legislation \n8 authorizes HRSA to impose grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, exclusion of \n9 transgender individuals, denying services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to \n10 providing health services for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS. \n11 ii.  RWHA Part B Program \n12 186.  The RWHA Part B program provides grants to each of the 50 states, the District of \n13 Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands for services such as drug treatments, home and community-\n14 based health care, support services, or health insurance coverage for low income individuals living with \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 HIV/AIDS, among other services.  42 U.S.C. §§ 30ff-22–26. Some of these states and territories pass \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 through RWHA Part B funds to subrecipients, including local governments.  One portion of RWHA \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Part B is the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (“ADAP”), which receives separate appropriations from \nN\nN\nE 18 Congress.  Id. § 300ff-26.  The remaining funding goes toward Part B base grants and supplemental \nR\n19 grants.  Base grants are awarded pursuant to a formula based on the number of individuals living with \n20 HIV/AIDS cases in the state or territory relative to various comparators.  Id. § 300ff-28.  Supplemental \n21 grants under RWHA Part B are awarded to states and territories with a demonstrated need based on \n22 increasing rates of HIV/AIDS cases, unmet needs for services, and other factors.  Id. § 300ff-29a. \n23 187.  Congress has imposed detailed conditions on RWHA Part B grants.  For instance, as in \n24 the Part A program, recipients of Part B funds must spend 75% of awarded funds on “core medical \n25 services” and 25% on “support services,” which are each limited to specifically defined activities.  42 \n26 U.S.C. § 300ff-22.  The Part B program also authorizes states and territories to award grants to \n27 subrecipients and imposes additional requirements on such sub-awards based on the type of services the \n28 subrecipient will provide.  See id. §§ 300ff-23–24.  For example, Congress has authorized states and \n    -45-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 46 of 108\n1 territories to award grants for home- and community-based health services, but requires states and \n2 territories to prioritize providers who serve low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS and participate in an \n3 HIV care consortium.  Id. § 300ff-24(b). \n4 188.  The statute authorizes the Secretary of HHS to require other “agreements, assurances, and \n5 information” from states and territories, but only to the extent “necessary to carry out” the Secretary’s \n6 authority to “make grants to . . . enable . . . States to improve the quality, availability and organization of \n7 health care and support services for individuals and families with HIV/AIDS.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 300ff-27(a), \n8 300ff-21. \n9 189.  Congress has also authorized states and territories to award grants using RWHA Part B \n10 funds to certain associations, called HIV care consortia, comprised of public or private service providers \n11 and community-based organizations in areas most affected by HIV/AIDS.  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-23.  In \n12 doing so, Congress set forth specific agreements and assurances related to the purposes of the Part B \n13 program that HIV care consortia must make as a condition to receiving funds.  For instance, HIV care \n14 consortia must “agree to use such assistance for the planning, development and delivery . . . of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 comprehensive outpatient health and support services for individuals with HIV/AIDS.”  Id. § 300ff-\nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 23(a)(2).  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 190.  The assurances and application requirements Congress specified for HIV care consortia \nN\nN\nE 18 under RWHA Part B indicate a statutory purpose to address the needs of minority and underserved \nR\n19 communities.  For instance, each HIV care consortium must provide an assurance that “the populations \n20 and subpopulations of individuals and families with HIV/AIDS have been identified by the consortium, \n21 particularly those experiencing disparities in access and services and those who reside in historically \n22 underserved communities.” Id. § 300ff-23(b)(1)(A).  The consortium must also provide an assurance that \n23 it has established a service plan that “addresses the special care and service needs of” such historically \n24 underserved communities.  Id. § 300ff-23(b)(1)(B).  Finally, Congress specified grant application \n25 requirements that HIV care consortia must meet to be eligible for funding, including that the application \n26 “demonstrates that adequate planning occurred to address disparities in access and services and \n27 historically underserved communities.” Id. § 300ff-23(c)(1)(F). \n28 191.  Neither the statutes governing the RWHA Part B program nor any other legislation \n    -46-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 47 of 108\n1 authorizes HRSA to impose grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, exclusion of \n2 transgender individuals, denying services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to \n3 providing health services for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS. \n4 iii.  RWHA Part C Program \n5 192.  RWHA Part C grants emphasize services designed to intervene early to improve health \n6 outcomes for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS.  HRSA awards RWHA Part C grants \n7 competitively to eligible facilities, including municipal health facilities, that serve medically underserved \n8 populations.  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-52(a).  Congress has mandated that HRSA prioritize applicants \n9 experiencing increased burdens on HIV/AIDS services when awarding RWHA Part C grants.  Id. \n10 § 300ff-53. \n11 193.  Like Part A and Part B grants, Part C grants are subject to specific statutory requirements.  \n12 For instance, Part C grant recipients must also provide a mix of statutorily prescribed “core services” and \n13 “supportive serves.”  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-51(b)(1).  At least half of allocated funding must go toward such \n14 services that focus on early intervention, including HIV/AIDS testing and referrals.  Id. § 300ff-51(b)(2).  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 The statute also requires applicants to agree to certain funding conditions, including that the applicant \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 will only use funds for statutorily authorized purposes, will establish fiscal control and accounting \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 procedures, and will establish a clinical quality management program, among others.  Id. § 300ff-64(g).  \nN\nN\nE 18 Finally, Congress has mandated conditions on the use of funds for HIV/AIDS counseling, including that \nR\n19 counseling programs may not directly promote intravenous drug use or sexual activity and must educate \n20 patients on the availability of hepatitis a and b vaccines.  Id. § 300ff-67. \n21 194.  Neither the statutes governing the RWHA Part C program nor any other legislation \n22 authorizes HRSA to impose grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, exclusion of \n23 transgender individuals, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to providing early intervention \n24 services for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS. \n25 2.  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Programs  \n26 195.  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within \n27 HHS, “funds organizations providing substance use and mental health services, research, technical \n28 assistance, and training to advance the behavioral health and to improve the lives of individuals living \n    -47-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 48 of 108\n1 with mental and substance use disorders, and their families.”  Grants, SAMHSA, \n2 https://www.samhsa.gov/grants (last visited July 1, 2025).  SAMHSA administers both competitive, \n3 discretionary grant programs and “noncompetitive, formula grant” programs “mandated by the U.S. \n4 Congress.”  Id.  Examples of these noncompetitive block grants include the Community Mental Health \n5 Services Block Grant and the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant. \n6 196.  SAMHSA’s authority to issue grants under its various programs is conferred by statute.  \n7 See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 290dd-3 (Grants for reducing overdose deaths), 290dd-4 (Program to support \n8 coordination and continuation of care for drug overdose patients), 290ee (Opioid overdose reversal \n9 medication access, education, and co-prescribing grant programs), 290ee-1 (First responder training), \n10 290ee-2 (Building communities of recovery), 290ee-3 (State demonstration grants for comprehensive \n11 opioid abuse response), 290ee-3a  (Grant program for State and Tribal response to opioid use disorders), \n12 290ee-5a (Sobriety treatment and recovery teams), 290ee-9 (Services for families and patients in crisis).  \n13 These statutes list the required criteria for a grant application and allowable uses for grant funds.  None \n14 of the statutes establishing these programs authorize conditions on these grants related to prohibiting all \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 forms of DEI, exclusion of transgender individuals, denying services to immigrants, or adherence to \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 197.  One of the requirements provided in SAMHSA’s Notices of Award (NOA) is a “Disparity \nN\nN\nE 18 Impact Statement (DIS),” which includes “[a] quality improvement plan for how [recipients will use \nR\n19 program data] to monitor and manage program outcomes by race, ethnicity, and LGBT status, when \n20 possible.”  SAMHSA also required the quality improvement plan to “include strategies for how processes \n21 and/or programmatic adjustments will support efforts to reduce disparities for the identified sub-\n22 populations.”  The NOAs do not include any grant conditions related to prohibiting all kinds of DEI, \n23 exclusion of transgender people, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to overdose response.  \n24 3.  Center for Disease Control and Prevention Grant Programs   \n25 198.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within HHS describes itself as \n26 “the nation’s leading science-based, data-driven, service organization that protects the public’s health.” \n27 Home, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/ (last accessed June 30, 2025).  CDC provides much of the funding to \n28 support public health systems and activities by state and local governments.  Josh Michaud, et al., CDC’s \n    -48-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 49 of 108\n1 Funding for State and Local Public Health: How Much and Where Does it Go?, KFF, \n2 https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/cdcs-funding-for-state-and-local-publichealth-how-much-and-\n3 where-does-it-go/ (Apr. 7, 2025).  In FY 2023, CDC obligated almost $15 billion to state and local \n4 jurisdictions.  Id.  The CDC’s funding supports a range of programs including HIV/AIDS, Viral \n5 Hepatitis, STI, and TB Prevention; Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; Public Health \n6 Preparedness and Response; and Injury Prevention and Control.  Grant Funding Profiles – Funding \n7 Category View, CDC, https://fundingprofiles.cdc.gov/Category/Category (last visited June 30, 2025). \n8 199.  For example, one of the grants awarded by CDC is the High-Impact HIV Prevention and \n9 Surveillance Programs for Health Departments grant, which is a part of CDC’s funding for HIV/AIDS, \n10 Viral Hepatitis, STI, and TB Prevention. As explained by the most recent 2024 NOFO for this program, \n11 the grant funds recipients “to implement a comprehensive, person-centered HIV prevention and \n12 surveillance program to prevent new HIV infections and improve the health of people with HIV.” \n13 200.  The NOFO for this program includes as a required element, “Addressing Social and \n14 Structural Factors.”  The NOFO recognizes that “[t]he impact of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 stigma significantly exacerbates the health disparities experienced among communities \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 disproportionately affected by HIV.  Health equity is a desirable goal that entails special efforts to \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 improve the health of those who have experienced social or economic disadvantage.”  With respect to the \nN\nN\nE 18 “Population(s) of Focus,” the NOFO explains that “Applicants must provide HIV services to populations \nR\n19 within the jurisdiction that are disproportionately impacted by HIV as identified by their epidemiological \n20 data, gaps in services, or need,” and “Examples to consider based on national and local data, include \n21 transgender women, cisgender Black or African American women, gay and bisexual men, American \n22 Indian or Alaska Native gay and bisexual men, people who inject drugs (PWID), youth, pregnant and \n23 postpartum persons and their infants, and other populations with disproportionately higher rates of HIV \n24 diagnosis including individuals involved in the justice system and people experiencing housing \n25 insecurity.” \n26 201.  The NOFO did not include any grant conditions related to prohibiting all kinds of DEI, \n27 exclusion of transgender people, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to HIV/AIDS surveillance \n28 and prevention. \n    -49-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 50 of 108\n1 202.  Statutory authority for the Fiscal Year 2024 High-Impact HIV Prevention and \n2 Surveillance Programs for Health Departments grant comes from 42 U.S.C. § 247c(b)–(c) and the \n3 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, Pub. L. 114-113, 129 Stat. 2242. 42 U.S.C. § 247c authorizes \n4 HHS to make grants like the High-Impact HIV Prevention and Surveillance Programs for Health \n5 Departments grant.  It also identifies authorized conditions on the grants, including recordkeeping \n6 requirements, 42 U.S.C. § 247c(e)(3), and patient confidentiality mandates, id. § 247c(e)(5).  Neither 42 \n7 U.S.C. § 247c nor the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 authorizes or impose conditions on this \n8 grant related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, exclusion of transgender individuals, denying services to \n9 immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to HIV/AIDS surveillance and prevention.  \n10 4.  Other HHS Grants \n11 203.  HHS and its operating divisions and agencies administer a range of other grant programs \n12 that some plaintiffs have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive.  \n13 Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on these \n14 other HHS grants related to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI, exclusion of transgender people, denying \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 204.  Congress annually appropriates funding for HHS grant programs.  In the annual \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the Secretary of HHS with \nN\nN\nE 18 respect to funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \nR\n19 conditions on HHS grants related to a prohibition on DEI, exclusion of transgender people, denying \n20 services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant.  See, e.g., \n21 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1523–28, 1567–98; Consolidated \n22 Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub.

EPA Grant Programs  \n3 206.  Congress established the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) in 1970 through \n4 Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, 35 Fed. Reg. 15623 (Oct. 6, 1970), which consolidated many \n5 environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency.  Every year, EPA awards \n6 more than $4 billion in funding for grants and other assistance agreements to state and local \n7 governments, tribes, universities, nonprofit recipients, and other entities to protect human health and the \n8 environment.  See U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, EPA Grants Overview for Applicants and Recipients, \n9 https://www.epa.gov/grants/epa-grants-overview-applicants-and-recipients.  The EPA Administrator is \n10 responsible for overseeing all agency programs and offices, supervising the administration of grants and \n11 other funding, and ensuring the agency’s actions comply with statutory and executive requirements.  See, \n12 e.g., 42 U.S. Code §§ 6912; 9628; 13103(a).   \n13 1.  Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program \n14 207.  The EPA’s Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program provides funds to states, Tribal \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Nations, communities, and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up, and \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 sustainably reuse contaminated or potentially contaminated properties, commonly referred to as \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 “brownfields.”  See U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, EPA Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund Grants Program \nN\nN\nE 18 Overview, https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-08/Program%20Overview_RLF.pdf.  \nR\n19 Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) Grants provide funding to a grant recipient for capitalizing an RLF \n20 program.  RLF programs provide loans and subgrants to eligible entities to carry out cleanup activities at \n21 brownfield sites contaminated with hazardous substances.   \n22 2.  Congress Authorized the Establishment of Brownfields and Land \n23 Revitalization Grants \n24 208.  Congress authorized the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program through the Small \n25 Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-118, 115 Stat. \n26 2356 (2002).  This statute amended section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n27 Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and established EPA’s Brownfields Program in its current \n28 form.  Congress authorized the EPA to award assessment grants, cleanup grants, revolving loan fund \n    -51-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 52 of 108\n1 (“RLF”) grants, and job training grants.  See 42 U.S.C. § 9604(k)(2)–(6).  The RLF program, set forth in \n2 42 U.S.C. § 9604(k)(3), enables eligible entities to establish loan funds that can be used to finance \n3 cleanup activities at brownfield sites.   \n4 3.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and EPA Promulgates Rules \n5 Regarding the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program  \n6 209.  EPA’s administration of the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program, including the \n7 award of RLF grants, is authorized and governed by statutory directives.  Congress has specified what \n8 activities are eligible for funding under the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program, the \n9 responsibilities of grant recipients, and specific certifications that grant recipients must agree to as a \n10 condition of receiving funds.  For example, assessment grants may only be used for inventorying, \n11 characterizing, assessing, and conducting planning activities related to brownfield sites.  42 U.S.C. \n12 § 9604(k)(2).  RLF grants must be used either to capitalize revolving loan funds or, in certain cases, \n13 directly for remediation at sites owned by the grantee or an eligible nonprofit.  Id. § 9604(k)(3).  \n14 Congress also imposed clear prohibitions on the use of funds.  No grant or loan may be used to pay \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 penalties or fines, to satisfy a federal cost-share requirement, to pay cleanup costs at a site where the \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 recipient is a potentially responsible party under CERCLA § 107, or to cover compliance costs under \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 other federal environmental laws (except those associated with cleanup).  Id. § 9604(k)(5)(B). \nN\nN\nE 18 210.  Additionally, every grant or loan agreement must require the recipient to comply with all \nR\n19 applicable federal and state laws and provide a 20 percent non-federal matching share in cash or in-kind \n20 contributions, unless EPA determines that such a match would cause undue hardship.  42 U.S.C. \n21 § 9604(k)(10)(B).  Congress further directed EPA to weigh community involvement and equity \n22 considerations in awarding grants.  The ranking criteria established by statute requires consideration of \n23 the extent to which projects provide for meaningful local community participation in cleanup and reuse \n24 decisions, and “the extent to which a grant would address or facilitate the identification and reduction of \n25 threats to the health or welfare of children, pregnant women, minority or low-income communities, or \n26 other sensitive populations.”  Id. § 9604(k)(6)(C)(x). \n27 211.  The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 does not \n28 authorize EPA to condition funding on prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \n    -52-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 53 of 108\n1 immigration laws, certifying certain facts are material for the purposes of the False Claims Act, or \n2 prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  Funding for the Brownfields \n3 and Land Revitalization Program comes from congressional appropriations.  Most recently, Congress \n4 appropriated funds for the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program in the Consolidated \n5 Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 252–263.  Nothing in the 2024 Appropriations Act \n6 or any other legislation authorizes EPA to impose grant fund conditions related to prohibiting all forms \n7 of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, certifying certain facts are material for the \n8 purposes of the False Claims Act, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective \n9 abortion.”   \n10 4.  Other EPA Grants \n11 212.  EPA and its operating divisions and agencies administer a range of other grant programs \n12 that some plaintiffs have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive.  \n13 Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on these \n14 other EPA grants related to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI, exclusion of transgender people, denying \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 213.  Congress annually appropriates funding for EPA grant programs.  In the annual \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the Administrator of EPA with \nN\nN\nE 18 respect to funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \nR\n19 conditions on EPA grants related to a prohibition on DEI, exclusion of transgender people, denying \n20 services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant.

Following President Trump’s Inauguration, Defendants Unilaterally Impose New \n3 Conditions on Federal Grants. \n4 1.  President Trump Issues Executive Orders Directing Federal Agencies to \n5 Impose New Conditions on Federal Grants  \n6 215.  Since taking office, President Trump has issued numerous executive orders directing the \n7 heads of executive agencies to impose conditions on federal funding that bear little or no connection to \n8 the purposes of the grant programs Congress established, lack statutory authorization, conflict with the \n9 law as interpreted by the courts, and are even at odds with the purposes of the grants they purport to \n10 amend.  Instead, the conditions appear to require federal grant recipients to agree to promote the political \n11 agenda President Trump campaigned on during his run for office and has continued espousing since, \n12 including prohibiting all kinds of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification \n13 of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  \n14 Plaintiffs cannot comply with Defendants’ vague, ambiguous, and unauthorized conditions without \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 exposing themselves to substantial legal liability or forgo critical federal funding.   \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 216.  The “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” executive \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 order directs each federal agency head to include “in every contract or grant award” a term that the \nN\nN\nE 18 contractor or grant recipient “certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI” that would \nR\n19 violate federal antidiscrimination laws.  Exec. Order 14173 § 3(b)(iv)(B), 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, \n20 2025) (the “DEI Order”).  The certification is not limited to programs funded with federal grants.  Id. \n21 § 3(b)(iv).   \n22 217.  The DEI Order also directs each agency head to include a term requiring the contractor or \n23 grant recipient to agree that its compliance “in all respects” with all applicable federal nondiscrimination \n24 laws is “material to the government’s payment decisions” for purposes of the False Claims Act (FCA), \n25 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et seq. Id. § 3(b)(iv)(A).  The FCA imposes liability on “any person” who “knowingly \n26 presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.”  31 U.S.C. \n27 § 3729(a)(1)(A).  For FCA liability to attach, the alleged misrepresentation must be “material to the \n28 Government’s payment decision”—an element the U.S. Supreme Court has called “demanding.” \n    -54-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 55 of 108\n1 Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176, 192, 194 (2016).  Each \n2 violation of the FCA is punishable by a civil penalty of up to $27,894, plus mandatory treble damages \n3 sustained by the federal government because of that violation.  31 U.S.C. § 3729(a); 28 C.F.R. § 85.5(a).  \n4 Given the demands of proving materiality and the severity of penalties imposed by the FCA, the \n5 certification term represents another effort to coerce compliance with the President’s policies by \n6 effectively forcing grant recipients to concede an essential element of an FCA claim. \n7 218.  The DEI Order does not define the term “DEI.”  As explained below, subsequent \n8 executive agency memoranda and letters make clear that the Trump Administration’s conception of what \n9 federal antidiscrimination law requires, including what constitutes a purportedly “illegal” DEI program, \n10 is inconsistent with the requirements of federal nondiscrimination statutes as interpreted by the courts. \n11 219.  The “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” executive order directs all agency \n12 heads to ensure “that Federal payments to States and localities do not, by design or effect, facilitate the \n13 subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to \n14 shield illegal aliens from deportation.”  Executive Order 14218 § 2(ii), 90 Fed. Reg. 10581 (Feb. 19, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 2025) (the “Immigration Order”). \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 220.  The Immigration Order also purports to implement the Personal Responsibility and Work \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Opportunity Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”), pursuant to which certain federal benefits are limited to \nN\nN\nE 18 individuals with qualifying immigration status.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1611(a).  In particular, the Immigration \nR\n19 Order directs all agency heads to “identify all federally funded programs administered by the agency that \n20 currently permit illegal aliens to obtain any cash or non-cash public benefit” and “take all appropriate \n21 actions to align such programs with the purposes of this order and the requirements of applicable Federal \n22 law, including … PRWORA.”  Id. § 2(i).  \n23 221.  On April 28, 2025, President Trump issued additional executive orders related to \n24 immigration and law enforcement.  The “Protecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens” \n25 executive order states that “some State and local officials … continue to use their authority to violate, \n26 obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” and directs the Attorney General in \n27 coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify “sanctuary jurisdictions,” take steps to \n28 withhold federal funding from such places, and develop “mechanisms to ensure appropriate eligibility \n    -55-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 56 of 108\n1 verification is conducted for individuals receiving Federal public benefits … from private entities in a \n2 sanctuary jurisdiction, whether such verification is conducted by the private entity or by a governmental \n3 entity on its behalf.”  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/protecting-american-\n4 communities-from-criminal-aliens/.  The “Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to \n5 Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens” executive order directs the Attorney General to, among \n6 other things, “prioritize prosecution of any applicable violations of Federal criminal law with respect to \n7 State and local jurisdictions” whose officials “willfully and unlawfully direct the obstruction of criminal \n8 law, including by directly and unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement officers from carrying out duties \n9 necessary for public safety and law enforcement” or “unlawfully engage in discrimination or civil-rights \n10 violations under the guise of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives that restrict law enforcement \n11 activity or endanger citizens.”  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-\n12 and-unleashing-americas-law-enforcement-to-pursue-criminals-and-protect-innocent-citizens/.  \n13 222.  The “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological \n14 Truth to the Federal Government” executive order directs agency heads to “take all necessary steps, as \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology” and “assess grant conditions and \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 grantee preferences” to “ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.”  Exec. Order No. 14168 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 § 3(e), (g), 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 20, 2025) (the “Gender Ideology Order”).  The Gender Ideology \nN\nN\nE 18 Order states that “‘[g]ender ideology’ replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting \nR\n19 concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus \n20 become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.”  \n21 Id. § 2(f).  It goes on to state that “[g]ender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of \n22 genders that are disconnected from one’s sex” and is therefore “internally inconsistent, in that it \n23 diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a \n24 person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”  Id. \n25 223.  The “Enforcing the Hyde Amendment” executive order declares it the policy of the United \n26 States “to end the forced use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion.”  Exec. \n27 Order No. 14182, 90 Fed. Reg. 8751 (Jan. 24, 2025) (the “Abortion Order”).  The Acting Director of the \n28 U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum to the heads of the executive \n    -56-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 57 of 108\n1 agencies providing guidance on how agencies should implement the Abortion Order.

The OMB Memo told agency heads that the Trump \n5 Administration’s policy is “not to use taxpayer funds to fund, facilitate, or promote abortion, including \n6 travel or transportation to obtain an abortion, consistent with the Hyde Amendment and other statutory \n7 restrictions on taxpayer funding for abortion.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The OMB Memo further instructed \n8 agency heads to “reevaluate” policies and other actions to conform with the Abortion Funding Order, \n9 audit federally funded activities suspected to contravene the Abortion Funding Order, and submit a \n10 monthly report to OMB on each agency’s progress in implementing the OMB Memo.  Id. \n11 224.  On August 7, 2025 President Trump issued another executive order titled, Improving \n12 Oversight of Federal Grantmaking that requires that discretionary grant awards “demonstrably advance \n13 the President’s policy priorities” and “shall not be used to fund, promote, encourage, subsidize, or \n14 facilitate” “racial preferences or other forms of racial discrimination by the grant recipient,” “denial by \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 the grant recipient of the sex binary in humans or the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 characteristic,” or “any other initiatives that compromise public safety or promote anti-American values.”  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Exec. Order No. 14332, 90 Fed. Reg. 38929 (Aug. 7, 2025) (the “Grantmaking Oversight Order”). \nN\nN\nE 18 2.  HUD Attaches New Conditions to HUD Grants \nR\n19 225.  Since President Trump’s issuance of the executive orders described above and Defendant \n20 Turner’s confirmation as HUD Secretary, HUD has implemented President Trump’s Executive Orders by \n21 attaching new and unlawful conditions (collectively, the “HUD Grant Conditions”) across the expansive \n22 portfolio of HUD grants established by Congress; demanding grant recipients’ agreement to those new \n23 conditions and issuing agency-wide letters and statements about how HUD will enforce those conditions. \n24 a.  HUD issues new policy terms for all financial assistance incorporating \n25 the unlawful conditions \n26 226.  In or around April 2025, HUD amended its General Administrative, National, and \n27 Departmental Policy Requirements and Terms for HUD’s Financial Assistance Programs (the “HUD \n28 Policy Terms”), which set forth “various laws and policies that may apply to recipients of” HUD grant \n    -57-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 58 of 108\n1 awards.  This document is posted on HUD’s website at \n2 https://www.hud.gov/sites/default/files/CFO/documents/Administrative-Requirements-Addendum-\n3 FY2025.pdf.  Among such potentially applicable policies, the document lists several of President \n4 Trump’s executive orders as well as language implementing those orders.  \n5 227.  For example, in a section labelled “Compliance with Immigration Requirements,” the \n6 HUD Policy Terms list the Immigration Order and summarize the potentially applicable policy: \n7 No state or unit of general local government that receives HUD funding \nunder may use that funding in a manner that by design or effect facilitates \n8 the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration or abets policies that \nseek to shield illegal aliens from deportation. \n9  \n10 228.  Next, in a section labelled “Other Presidential Executive Actions Affecting Federal \n11 Financial Assistance Programs,” HUD Policy Terms state that “Recipients of Federal Awards must \n12 comply with applicable existing and future Executive Orders, as advised by the Department, including \n13 but not limited to . . . :” followed by a “non-exhaustive list” of nine executive orders—including the \n14 Immigration Order, the Abortion Order, the DEI Order, and the Gender Ideology Order—as “applicable” \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 conditions.  The HUD Policy Terms then summarize the potentially applicable policies reflected in those \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 executive orders. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 a. First, the HUD Policy Terms state that the Immigration Order “prohibits taxpayer \nN\nN\nE 18 resources and benefits from going to unqualified aliens.” \nR\n19 b. Second, the HUD Policy Terms summarize the Abortion Order as “prohibit[ing] the use of \n20 Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion.” \n21 c. Third, the HUD Policy Terms state that the DEI Order “requires Federal agencies to \n22 terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences.” \n23 d. Fourth, the HUD Policy Terms summary the Gender Ideology Order as “set[ting] forth \n24 U.S. policy recognizing two sexes, male and female.” \n25 229.  These requirements outlined in the HUD Policy Terms are unlawful because the \n26 requirements violate the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-\n27 vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n28\n    -58-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 59 of 108\n1 b.  HUD attaches a new, unlawful anti-DEI certification to its standard \n2 assurances and certifications \n3 230.  In or around May 2025, HUD updated its standard Applicant and Recipient Assurances \n4 and Certifications (the “HUD Certifications”) on Form HUD-424-B, which must be submitted as part of \n5 any application for HUD funding or post-award submission.  These changes implemented President \n6 Trump’s executive orders, including the DEI Order, by imposing a new anti-DEI certification that is not \n7 authorized by any of the statutes that establish HUD grant programs, any appropriations law \n8 appropriating funds for HUD grant programs, or HUD’s own regulations.  In particular, the HUD \n9 Certifications require HUD grant applicants to certify that the applicant: \n10 Will not use Federal funding to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion \n(DEI) mandates, policies, programs, or activities that violate any applicable \n11 Federal antidiscrimination laws. \n12 231.  This certification is unlawful, as explained further below, because the anti-DEI \n13 certification violates the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-\n14 vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 c.  HUD attaches new, unlawful conditions to CoC grants \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 232.  In or around June 2025, following President Trump’s issuance of the executive orders \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 described above, HUD presented recipients with CoC grant agreements for CoC funds awarded.  These \nN\nN\nE 18 grant agreements contained additional grant conditions not included in the FYs 2024 & 2025 NOFO, and \nR\n19 are not authorized by the Homeless Assistance Act, the Appropriations Act, or the Rule HUD itself \n20 promulgated to implement the CoC program.  HUD has required Plaintiffs with CoC grant awards to \n21 agree to these conditions to receive funds they are entitled to.  \n22 233.  The CoC grant agreements contain substantially the same unlawful, new terms and \n23 conditions, including the following (collectively, the “CoC Grant Conditions”): \n24 234.  First, the CoC grant agreements state that “[t]his Agreement, the Recipient’s use of funds \n25 provided under this Agreement . . . , and the Recipient’s operation of projects assisted with Grant Funds” \n26 are “governed by” not only certain specified statutes, rules and grant-related documents, but also by “all \n27 current Executive Orders.” The CoC grant agreements further require recipients to comply with \n28 “applicable requirements that . . . may [be] establish[ed] from time to time to comply with . . . other \n    -59-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 60 of 108\n1 Executive Orders” (together, the “CoC EO Condition”). \n2 235.  Second, a grant recipient must certify that: \nit does not operate any programs that violate any applicable Federal anti-\n3\ndiscrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n4\nThe recipient must further agree that this condition is “material” for purposes of the FCA by agreeing \n5\nthat: \n6\nits compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination \n7 laws is material to the U.S. Government’s payment decisions for purposes \nof [the FCA]. \n8\n9 (together, the “CoC Discrimination Condition”) \n10 236.  While Plaintiffs have routinely certified compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws \n11 as a condition of federal funding in the past, the Administration’s communications to federal grant \n12 recipients make clear that the agencies seek compliance with the Trump Administration’s novel, \n13 incorrect, and unsupported interpretation of federal nondiscrimination law as barring any and all DEI \n14 programs. Without Congress passing his anti-DEI agenda, President Trump instead purports to legislate \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 by executive order and impose his decrees on state and local governments seeking grant funding. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 237.  Third, the CoC Grant Agreements provide: \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Nthois  sgtaraten to mr uanyi tu osef  gtheante fruanl dloincgal i gno av merannmneenr tt hthaat tb rye cdeeisviegsn f ourn definfegc tu nder \nN\nEN 18 facilitates the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration or abets \nR\npolicies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation . . . . \n19\nThe CoC Grant Agreements further require compliance with “applicable requirements that . . . may [be] \n20\nestablish[ed] from time to time to comply with . . . [the Immigration Order] . . or immigration laws” \n21\n(together, the “CoC Enforcement Condition”).3 \n22\n238.  Fourth, the CoC Grant Agreements impose requirements purportedly related to PRWORA \n23\nand other immigration eligibility and verification requirements: \n24\nThe recipient must administer its grant in accordance with all applicable \n25 immigration restrictions and requirements, including the eligibility and \nverification requirements that apply under title IV of [PRWORA] and any \n26\n \n27 3 More recent grant agreements contain updated language that recites the Immigration Order. In these, \nthe last part of this condition reads “. . . or abets so-called “sanctuary” policies that seek to shield illegal \n28 aliens from deportation. \n    -60-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 61 of 108\napplicable requirements that HUD, the Attorney General, or the U.S. \n1 Center for Immigration Services [sic] may establish from time to time to \ncomply with PRWORA, Executive Order 14218, or other Executive Orders \n2 or immigration laws. \n3 … \n4 Subject to the exceptions provided by PRWORA, the recipient must use \n[the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system], or an \n5 equivalent verification system approved by the Federal government, to \nprevent any Federal public benefit from being provided to an ineligible \n6 alien who entered the United States illegally or is otherwise unlawfully \npresent in the United States. \n7\n8 (the “CoC Verification Condition”). \n9 239.  Fifth, the CoC Grant Agreements require the recipient to agree that it “shall not grant \n10 funds to promote ‘gender ideology,’ as defined in” the Gender Ideology Order (the “CoC Gender \n11 Ideology Condition”). \n12 240.  Finally, the CoC Grant Agreements require the recipient to agree that it “shall not use any \n13 Grant Funds to fund or promote elective abortions, as required by” the Abortion Order. \n14 (the “CoC Abortion Condition”). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 241.  These conditions are unconstitutional and unlawful for several reasons.  As an initial \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 matter, neither the Homeless Assistance Act, the Appropriations Act, PRWORA, nor any legislation \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 authorizes HUD to attach these conditions to federal funds appropriated for CoC grants. \nN\nN\nE 18 d.  HUD announces it will attach new, unlawful conditions to Office of \nR\n19 Community Planning and Development grants \n20 242.  In or around June 2025, HUD’s CPD, which administers the CDBG, ESG, HOME, and \n21 HOPWA programs, among others, issued guidance announcing that it will attach new conditions to \n22 Fiscal Year 2025 agreements governing all CPD-administered grants. \n23 243.  In particular, on June 5, 2025, CPD General Deputy Assistant Secretary Claudette \n24 Fernandez issued a letter to the executive directors of two organizations representing states and local \n25 jurisdictions that administer CPD grant programs (the “Fernandez Letter”).  The Fernandez Letter states \n26 that CPD “[g]rantees are . . . encouraged to review the White House Executive Orders as they develop \n27 their consolidated plan and annual action plans,” which are required under the CDBG, HOME, HOPWA, \n28 and ESG programs.

The Fernandez Letter goes on to state that “FY2025 grant agreement[s]” that are issued \n5 after a recipient submits their consolidated and action plans will “emphasize conformity with applicable \n6 Administration priorities and executive orders.”  It clarifies that, “[u]nder the FY 2025 grant agreement, \n7 conformity means” that the recipient will be required to abide by a list of specific conditions.  These \n8 include the following (collectively, the “CPD Grant Conditions”): \n9 245.  First, grant recipients will be required to agree not to “not use grant funds to promote \n10 ‘gender ideology,’ as defined in [the Gender Ideology Order]” (the “CPD Gender Ideology Condition”). \n11 246.  Second, each recipient must “certif[y] that it does not operate any programs that violate \n12 any applicable Federal antidiscrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”  Each \n13 recipient must also “agree[] that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n14 discrimination laws is material to the U.S. Government’s payment decisions for purposes of [the FCA]” \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 (together, the “CPD Discrimination Condition”).  \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 247.  Third, grant recipients must agree that: \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 [i]f applicable, no state or unit of general local government that receives \nN funding under this grant may use that funding in a manner that by design or \nN\nRE 18 effect facilitates the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration or \nabets policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.  \n19  \n20 (the “CPD Enforcement Condition”). \n21 248.  Fourth, each recipient must agree to conditions purportedly related to PRWORA and other \n22 immigration eligibility and verification requirements, specifically: \n23 The Grantee must administer its grant in accordance with all applicable \nimmigration restrictions and requirements, including the eligibility and \n24 verification requirements that apply under title IV of the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, as \n25 amended (8 U.S.C. 1601-1646) (PRWORA) and any applicable \nrequirements that HUD, the Attorney General, or the U.S. Citizenship and \n26 Immigration Services may establish from time to time to comply with \nPRWORA, Executive Order 14218, or other Executive Orders or \n27 immigration laws. \n28 . . . . \n    -62-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 63 of 108\nUnless excepted by PRWORA, the Grantee must use SAVE, or an \n1 equivalent verification system approved by the Federal government, to \nprevent any Federal public benefit from being provided to an ineligible \n2 alien who entered the United States illegally or is otherwise unlawfully \npresent in the United States.  \n3\n(together, the “CPD Verification Condition”). \n4\n249.  Fifth, “[u]nless excepted by PRWORA,” grant recipients “must use SAVE, or an \n5\nequivalent verification system approved by the Federal government, to prevent any Federal public benefit \n6\nfrom being provided to an ineligible alien who entered the United States illegally or is otherwise \n7\nunlawfully present in the United States.” \n8\n250.  Finally, grant recipients must agree that they will “not use any grant funds to fund or \n9\npromote elective abortions, as required by [the Abortion Order]” (the “CPD Abortion Condition”). \n10\n251.  In addition to imposing these conditions through grant agreements, HUD is threatening to \n11\ndisapprove consolidated plans—including plans that have already been submitted—unless jurisdictions \n12\nresubmit revised plans that (1) include assurances that the jurisdictions will comply with the CPD Grant \n13\nConditions and (2) strip the plans of certain words that HUD claims, in and of themselves, violate the \n14\n P\nU related EOs, such as “equity” and “environmental justice.” HUD is requiring these revisions and \nO\nGRw  15\nW La commitments with as little as 24 hours’ notice. \nLLIC Aeys at  16 252.  The CPD Grant Conditions are unlawful for the same reasons the other conditions are \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN unlawful, as explained above.  In particular, and as explained further below, the CPD Grant Conditions \nN\nE 18\nR\nviolate the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness \n19\ndoctrine, and the APA. \n20\n3.  DOT and its Operating Administrations Attach New Conditions to DOT \n21\nGrants  \n22\n253.  Since Secretary Duffy’s confirmation, DOT and its operating administrations have \n23\nimplemented President Trump’s Executive Orders by attaching new and unlawful conditions \n24\n(collectively, the “DOT Grant Conditions”) across the expansive portfolio of DOT grants established by \n25\nCongress; demanding grant recipients’ agreement to those new conditions, sometimes on very short \n26\ntimelines; and issuing agency-wide letters and statements about how DOT will enforce those conditions.  \n27\n254.  The DOT’s broad conception of these new conditions is confirmed in a letter from DOT \n28\n    -63-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 64 of 108\n1 Secretary Sean Duffy to all recipients of DOT funding stating that “[w]hether or not described in neutral \n2 terms, any policy, program, or activity that is premised on a prohibited classification, including \n3 discriminatory policies or practices designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals, presumptively violates \n4 Federal Law.”  Letter from Sean Duffy, DOT Secretary, to All Recipients of DOT Funding (April 24, \n5 2025) (“April Duffy Letter”), https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-\n6 04/Follow%20the%20Law%20Letter%20to%20Applicants%204.24.25.pdf.    \n7 255.  The April Duffy Letter announced DOT’s “policy” of imposing immigration enforcement \n8 and anti-DEI conditions on all DOT-funded grants as a requirement of receiving funding, and makes \n9 clear that DOT interprets federal nondiscrimination law to presumptively prohibit “any policy, program, \n10 or activity that is premised on a prohibited classification, including discriminatory policies or practices \n11 designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals.”  It further asserts that recipients’ “legal obligations require \n12 cooperation generally with Federal authorities in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating \n13 with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other Federal offices and \n14 components of the Department of Homeland Security in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.”  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 The April Duffy Letter also threatens “vigorous[] enforcement,” ranging from comprehensive audits, \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 claw-back of grant funds, and termination of grant awards to enforcement actions and loss of any future \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 federal funding from DOT.  \nN\nN\nE 18 256.  Pursuant to the new policy set forth in the April Duffy Letter, DOT and its operating \nR\n19 administrations have attached substantially similar conditions relating to discrimination, immigration \n20 enforcement, and executive orders to all grant agreements.  \n21 a.  DOT and the FTA attach new, unlawful conditions to FTA Grants  \n22 257.  For instance, on March 26, 2025, the FTA issued an updated Master Agreement \n23 applicable to all funding awards authorized under specified federal statutes, including the FTA grant \n24 programs discussed above. \n25 258.  The March 26 Master Agreement imposed a new condition on all FTA grants \n26 implementing President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to condition federal grant funds \n27 on recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede this requirement is material for purposes of \n28 the FCA (“FTA Discrimination Condition”).  While FTA grants have long required compliance with \n    -64-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 65 of 108\n1 nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the FCA, the March 26 Master Agreement provided: \n2 (1) Pursuant to section (3)(b)(iv)(A), Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the \n3 Recipient agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable \nFederal antidiscrimination laws is material to the government’s payment \n4 decisions for purposes of [the FCA]. \n5 (2) Pursuant to section (3)(b)(iv)(B), Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, by entering \n6 into this Agreement, the Recipient certifies that it does not operate any \nprograms promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that \n7 violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. \n8 259.  That the FTA plans to enforce these new conditions more broadly than current \n9 nondiscrimination law is reinforced by the March 26 Master Agreement’s requirement that the recipient \n10 “comply with other applicable federal nondiscrimination laws, regulations, and requirements, and follow \n11 federal guidance prohibiting discrimination.”  \n12 260.  The FTA Discrimination Condition is in apparent tension with other requirements in the \n13 March 26 Master Agreement.  For example, the March 26 Master Agreement requires compliance with \n14 2 C.F.R. § 300.321, which states, “[w]hen possible, the recipient or subrecipient should ensure that small \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 businesses, minority businesses, women’s business enterprises, veteran- owned businesses, and labor \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 surplus area firms” are, inter alia, “included on solicitation lists” and “solicited” when “deemed eligible.”  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 261.  The FTA Discrimination Condition is also in apparent tension with DOT’s own \nN\nN\nE 18 regulations.  For example, 49 C.F.R. 21.5, which prohibits discrimination, states, “[w]here prior \nR\n19 discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin to exclude \n20 individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under \n21 any program or activity … the applicant or recipient must take affirmative action to remove or overcome \n22 the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or usage.”  49 C.F.R. 21.5(b)(7).  \n23 262.  Further, the March 26 Master Agreement defined “Federal Requirement” to include “[a]n \n24 applicable federal law, regulation, or executive order” (the “FTA EO Condition”).  The March 26 Master \n25 Agreement refers to President Trump’s DEI Order as an executive order “pursuant to” which the \n26 recipient must comply and certify, with no explanation of how the DEI Order relates to funding of mass \n27 transit.  \n28\n    -65-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 66 of 108\n1 263.  The April Duffy Letter to all recipients of DOT grants (including the FTA grants) further \n2 addresses the broad scope of the Administration’s anti-DEI agenda and how it expands and conflicts with \n3 established interpretations of federal nondiscrimination law, taking the position that any policy, program, \n4 or activity “designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals”—even if “described in neutral terms”—\n5 ”presumptively” violates federal nondiscrimination laws.  The April Duffy Letter also threatens \n6 “vigorous[] enforcement,” ranging from comprehensive audits, claw-back of grant funds, and termination \n7 of grant awards to enforcement actions and loss of any future federal funding from DOT.  \n8 264.  On April 25, 2025, the FTA issued another updated Master Agreement applicable to all \n9 funding awards authorized under specified federal statutes, including the FTA grant programs discussed \n10 above.  \n11 265.  The April 25 Master Agreement (“FTA Master Agreement”) contains the same FTA \n12 Discrimination Condition and the same FTA EO Condition set forth above.  But the FTA Master \n13 Agreement contains an additional condition requiring recipients to cooperate with federal immigration \n14 enforcement efforts (the “FTA Enforcement Condition”).  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 266.  In particular, the FTA Enforcement Condition amends an existing provision addressing \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 free speech and religious liberty as follows (new language emphasized): \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 The Recipient shall ensure that Federal funding is expended in full \nN accordance with the U.S. Constitution, Federal Law, and statutory and \nN\nRE 18 public policy requirements: including, but not limited to, those protecting \nfree speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, and \n19 prohibiting discrimination; and the Recipient will cooperate with Federal \nofficials in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating with and \n20 not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other \nFederal offices and components of the Department of Homeland Security \n21 in the enforcement of Federal immigration law. \n22 267.  The April Duffy Letter to all recipients of DOT grants (including the FTA grants) states \n23 that “DOT expects its recipients to comply with Federal law enforcement directives and to cooperate \n24 with Federal officials in the enforcement of Federal immigration law” and that “[d]eclining to cooperate \n25 with the enforcement of Federal immigration law or otherwise taking action intended to shield illegal \n26 aliens from ICE detection contravenes Federal law and may give rise to civil and criminal liability.” \n27 268.  In May 2025, FTA retroactively applied the April 2025 FTA Master Agreement to grants \n28 that were executed pursuant to earlier versions of the agreement.  By substituting those earlier \n    -66-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 67 of 108\n1 agreements with the FTA Master Agreement, the FTA purported to unilaterally add new substantive \n2 conditions to previously awarded grants without notifying the grant recipients.  \n3 269.  Neither the statutory provisions creating the FTA grants, the relevant appropriations acts, \n4 nor any other legislation authorizes the FTA to condition these funds on the recipient’s certification that \n5 it does not “promote DEI,” its admission that its compliance with this prohibition is material for purposes \n6 of the FCA, or its agreement to “cooperate” with federal immigration enforcement efforts.  Federal grant \n7 recipients are required to comply with nondiscrimination and other applicable federal laws.  But \n8 executive orders and letters from agency heads cannot change what these laws require under existing \n9 court decisions. \n10 270.  In sum and as further explained below, the FTA Discrimination Condition, the FTA EO \n11 Condition, and the FTA Enforcement Condition (collectively, the “FTA Grant Conditions”) violate the \n12 Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti- commandeering principle, the \n13 Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n14 b.  DOT and the FHWA attach new, unlawful conditions to FHWA \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Grants  \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 271.  On March 17, 2025, DOT issued revised General Terms and Conditions applicable to \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Fiscal Year 2024 SS4A grants (“FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions”). \nN\nN\nE 18 272.  The FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions imposed a new condition on all Fiscal \nR\n19 Year 2024 SS4A grants implementing President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to \n20 condition federal grant funds on recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede this \n21 requirement is material for purposes of the FCA (“SS4A Discrimination Condition”).  While SS4A \n22 grants have long required compliance with nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the FCA, the \n23 FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions provided:  \n24 (b)  Pursuant to Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination \nand Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the Recipient agrees that its \n25 compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination \nlaws is material to the government’s payment decisions for purposes of [the \n26 FCA]. \n27 (c)  Pursuant to Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination \nand Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, by entering into this agreement, \n28 the Recipient certifies that it does not operate any programs promoting \n    -67-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 68 of 108\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that violate any applicable \n1 Federal anti-discrimination law. \n2 273.  The SS4A Discrimination Condition is in apparent tension with other requirements in the \n3 FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions.  For example, the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and \n4 Conditions require compliance with 2 C.F.R. § 300.321, which states, “[w]hen possible, the recipient or \n5 subrecipient should ensure that small businesses, minority businesses, women’s business enterprises, \n6 veteran-owned businesses, and labor surplus area firms” are, inter alia, “included on solicitation lists” \n7 and “solicited” when “deemed eligible.”  \n8 274.  The SS4A Discrimination Condition is also in apparent tension with DOT’s own \n9 regulations.  For example, 49 C.F.R. 21.5, which prohibits discrimination, states, “[w]here prior \n10 discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin to exclude \n11 individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under \n12 any program or activity . . . the applicant or recipient must take affirmative action to remove or overcome \n13 the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or usage.”  49 C.F.R. 21.5(b)(7). \n14 275.  The FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions contain an additional condition \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 requiring recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts (the “SS4A Enforcement \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Condition”).  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 276.  In particular, the SS4A Enforcement Condition amends a pre-existing provision \nN\nN\nE 18 addressing free speech and religious liberty as follows (new language emphasized): \nR\n19 The Recipient shall ensure that Federal funding is expended in full \naccordance with the United States Constitution, Federal law, and statutory \n20 and public policy requirements: including but not limited to, those \nprotecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, \n21 and prohibiting discrimination; and Recipient will cooperate with Federal \nofficials in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating with and \n22 not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other \nFederal offices and components of the Department of Homeland Security \n23 in the enforcement of Federal immigration law. \n24 277.  Exhibit A to the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions also requires the recipient \n25 to assure and certify that it will “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, \n26 policies, guidelines, and requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal \n27 funds for this Project” (the “SS4A EO Condition”).  While this requirement existed in a similar form in \n28 prior agreements, Exhibit A to the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions lists President Trump’s \n    -68-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 69 of 108\n1 DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order (among other recent Trump Administration executive orders), as \n2 well as two criminal immigration statutes (8 U.S.C. § 1324 and 8 U.S.C. § 1327) as “provisions” \n3 purportedly “applicable” to SS4A grant agreements, with no explanation of how those Orders or statutes \n4 relate to roadway grants or even apply to local governments.  \n5 278.  Also on March 17, 2025, DOT issued revised General Terms and Conditions applicable to \n6 Fiscal Year 2023 SS4A grants and to Fiscal Year 2022 SS4A grants.  Those revised General Terms and \n7 Conditions, and the revised Exhibit A to each, contain provisions identical to the SS4A Discrimination \n8 Condition, the SS4A Immigration Condition, and the SS4A EO Condition discussed above. \n9 279.  On April 22, 2025, the FHWA issued Competitive Grant Program General Terms and \n10 Conditions purportedly applicable to all FHWA competitive grants (“2025 FHWA General Terms and \n11 Conditions”). \n12 280.  The 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions imposed a new condition on all FHWA \n13 competitive grants (including the BIP, Culvert AOP Program, and ATTAIN program discussed above) \n14 implementing President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order and further explained in the April \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Duffy letter, to condition federal grant funds on recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 this requirement is material for purposes of the FCA (“FHWA Discrimination Condition”).  While \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 FHWA grants have long required compliance with nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the \nN\nN\nE 18 FCA, the 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions provide: \nR\n19 (b) Pursuant to Section (3)(b)(iv)(A), Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the \n20 Recipient agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable \nFederal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment \n21 decisions for purposes of [the FCA]. \n22 (c) Pursuant to Section (3)(b)(iv)(B), Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, by entering \n23 into this agreement, the Recipient certifies that it does not operate any \nprograms promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that \n24 violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. \n25 281.  The 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions contain an additional condition requiring \n26 recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts (the “FHWA Enforcement \n27 Condition”). \n28\n    -69-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 70 of 108\n1 282.  In particular, the FHWA Enforcement Condition incorporates immigration enforcement \n2 into a provision addressing compliance with federal law and policy as follows 8 (immigration \n3 enforcement language emphasized): \n4 The Recipient shall ensure that Federal funding is expended in full \naccordance with the United States Constitution, Federal law, and statutory \n5 and public policy requirements: including but not limited to, those \nprotecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, \n6 and prohibiting discrimination; and the Recipient will cooperate with \nFederal officials in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating \n7 with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement  (ICE)  \nand other Federal offices and components of the Department of Homeland \n8 Security in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.  \n9 283.  The Exhibits to the 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions—dated April 30, 2025 \n10 and applicable to FHWA competitive grants—further require the recipient to assure and certify that it \n11 will “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, policies, guidelines, and \n12 requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal funds for this Project” (the \n13 “FHWA EO Condition”).  The Exhibits list President Trump’s DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order \n14 (among other recent Trump Administration executive orders), as well as two criminal immigration \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 statutes (8 U.S.C. § 1324 and 8 U.S.C. § 1327), as “provisions” purportedly “applicable” to FHWA \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 competitive grant agreements, with no explanation of how those Orders or statutes relate to highway \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 grants or even apply to local governments. \nN\nN\nE 18 284.  Additionally, the April Duffy Letter (described in paragraphs 85 and 86 above) was \nR\n19 directed to all recipients of DOT grants, including those receiving FHWA grants. \n20 285.  Neither the statutory provisions creating the FHWA grants, the relevant appropriations \n21 acts, nor any other legislation authorizes the FHWA or DOT to condition these funds on the recipient’s \n22 certification that it does not “promote DEI,” its admission that its compliance with this prohibition is \n23 material for purposes of the FCA, or its agreement to “cooperate” with federal immigration enforcement \n24 efforts.  Federal grant recipients are required to comply with nondiscrimination and other applicable \n25 federal laws.  But executive orders and letters from agency heads cannot change what these laws require \n26 under existing court decisions.  \n27 286.  In sum and as further explained below, the SS4A Discrimination Condition, the SS4A \n28 Enforcement Condition, the SS4A EO Condition, the FHWA Discrimination Condition, the FHWA \n    -70-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 71 of 108\n1 Enforcement Condition, and the FHWA EO Condition (collectively, the “FHWA Grant Conditions”) \n2 violate the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti- commandeering \n3 principle, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n4 c.  DOT and the FAA attach new, unlawful conditions to FAA Grants   \n5 287.  Implementing the April Duffy Letter and the Trump Administration Executive Orders, on \n6 April 25, 2025, the FAA issued a proposal labeled “Notice of modification of Airport Improvement \n7 Program grant assurances; opportunity to comment,” providing notice and soliciting public comments on \n8 modifications to the Grant Assurances (“2025 FAA Grant Assurances”).  In its notice, the FAA stated \n9 that the 2025 FAA Grant Assurances would become effective immediately, notwithstanding the \n10 opportunity to comment.  \n11 288.  The 2025 FAA Grant Assurances require the sponsor to assure and certify that it will \n12 “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, policies, guidelines, and \n13 requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal funds for this Grant.”  \n14 While this requirement existed in a similar form in prior versions of the Grant Assurances, the 2025 FAA \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Grant Assurances list President Trump’s DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order (among other recent \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Trump Administration executive orders), and incorporates all other executive orders, including the \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Immigration Order, as “provisions” purportedly “applicable” to grant agreements, even though these \nN\nN\nE 18 Orders on their face do not apply to non-federal entities and do not relate to funding of airport \nR\n19 development or infrastructure.  Congress has not directed or authorized that the DEI Order, Gender \n20 Ideology Order, or Immigration Order be imposed as Grant Assurances. \n21 289.  Implementing the April Duffy Letter and the Trump administration Executive Orders, on \n22 May 6, 2025, FAA posted on its website a revised grant agreement template for 2025 for AIG grants with \n23 added terms and conditions that did not appear in prior iterations of FAA grant agreements (“FY 2025 \n24 FAA AIG Grant Template”).  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template has not been circulated for \n25 comment, as is statutorily required for changes to Grant Assurances. \n26 290.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template imposes a new condition on all AIG grants that \n27 implements President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to condition federal grant funds on \n28 recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede that this requirement is material for purposes of \n    -71-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 72 of 108\n1 the FCA (the “FAA Discrimination Condition”).  While FAA grants have long required compliance with \n2 nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the FCA, the FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template \n3 provides: \n4 Pursuant to Section (3)(b)(iv), Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal \nDiscrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the sponsor: \n5\na. Agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n6 discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment decisions for \npurposes of [the FCA]; and  \n7\nb. certifies that it does not operate any programs promoting diversity, \n8 equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that violate any applicable Federal \nanti-discrimination laws. \n9  \n10 291.  The FAA Discrimination Condition is in apparent tension with statutorily required Grant \n11 Assurances imposed on sponsors with respect to FAA grant funds.  For example, one of the statutorily \n12 required Grant Assurances sponsors must make for airport development grants is that the airport sponsor \n13 will take necessary action to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that at least 10 percent of all \n14 businesses at the airport selling consumer products or providing consumer services to the public are small \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 business concerns owned and controlled by “a socially and economically disadvantaged individual” or \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 other small business concerns in historically underutilized business zones.  49 U.S.C. § 47107(e)(1).  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 “Socially and economically disadvantaged individual” is defined to include “Black Americans, Hispanic \nN\nN\nE 18 Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities,” as well as women.  \nR\n19 49 U.S.C. § 47113(a)(2); 15 U.S.C. § 637(d). \n20 292.  The FAA Discrimination Condition is also in apparent tension with DOT’s own \n21 regulations.  For example, 49 C.F.R. 21.5, which prohibits discrimination, states, “[w]here prior \n22 discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin to exclude \n23 individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under \n24 any program or activity … the applicant or recipient must take affirmative action to remove or overcome \n25 the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or usage.”  49 C.F.R. 21.5(b)(7).  And the FAA \n26 Discrimination Condition is in tension with other provisions of the FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template.  \n27 For example, the FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template states that the “sponsor’s [Disadvantaged Business \n28 Enterprise] and [Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise] programs as required by \n    -72-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 73 of 108\n1 49 C.F.R. Parts 26 and 23, and as approved by DOT, are incorporated by reference in this agreement.”  \n2 But 49 C.F.R. 23.25(e), for instance, requires the use of “race-conscious measures” in implementing the \n3 Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program when race-neutral measures, standing \n4 alone, are not projected to be sufficient to meet an overall goal, and sets forth examples of race-conscious \n5 measures airports can implement. \n6 293.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template contains an additional condition requiring \n7 sponsors to cooperate with the enforcement of any federal law, including federal immigration \n8 enforcement efforts (the “FAA Enforcement Condition”).  \n9 294.  In particular, the FAA Enforcement Condition incorporates immigration enforcement into \n10 a provision addressing free speech and religious liberty as follows (immigration enforcement language \n11 emphasized): \n12 The Sponsor shall ensure that Federal funding is expended in full \naccordance with the United States Constitution, Federal law, and statutory \n13 and public policy requirements: including but not limited to, those \nprotecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, \n P 14 and prohibiting discrimination; and the Sponsor will cooperate with \nU\nO Federal officials in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating \nGRw  15 with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 aSnecdu ortihtye rin F aendde rtahle o efnfifcoersc eamnde ncto omf pFoendeenrtasl  oifm tmhei gDraetpiaornt mlaewn.t   of Homeland \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 295.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template further states with respect to immigration: “Title \nN\nN\nE 18 8 - U.S.C., Chapter 12, Subchapter II - Immigration.  The sponsor will follow applicable federal laws \nR\n19 pertaining to Subchapter 12, and be subject to the penalties set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1324, Bringing in and \n20 harboring certain aliens, and 8 U.S.C. § 1327, Aiding or assisting certain aliens to enter.”  The FY 2025 \n21 FAA AIG Grant Template does not explain how those criminal immigration statutes relate to airport \n22 grants or even apply to local governments.  \n23 296.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template also requires the sponsor to assure and certify \n24 that it will “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, policies, guidelines, \n25 and requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal funds for this Grant” \n26 (the “FAA EO Condition”).  While this requirement existed in a similar form in prior agreements, the \n27 FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template lists President Trump’s DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order \n28 (among other recent Trump Administration executive orders), and incorporates all other executive orders, \n    -73-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 74 of 108\n1 including the Immigration Order, as “provisions” purportedly “applicable” to grant agreements, with no \n2 explanation of how those Orders relate to funding of airport development or infrastructure or apply to \n3 local governments. \n4 297.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template also states that the “FAA may terminate this \n5 agreement and all of its obligations under this agreement” in certain circumstances, including if “FAA \n6 determines that termination of this agreement is in the public interest”; and further states that “[i]n \n7 terminating this agreement under this section, the FAA may elect to consider only the interests of the \n8 FAA” (the “FAA Termination Condition”).  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template does not define \n9 “the public interest” or “the interests of the FAA” that would support a termination decision or expressly \n10 limit those interests to the funding of airport development or infrastructure.  \n11 298.  AIP and AIG grant agreements require sponsors to certify a number of sponsor assurances \n12 (i.e., the Grant Assurances described above) that require sponsors to maintain and operate their facilities \n13 safely, efficiently, and in accordance with specified conditions, including compliance with numerous \n14 statutes, agency rules, and executive orders. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 299.  Additionally, The April Duffy Letter was directed to all recipients of DOT grants, \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 including those receiving FAA grants.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 300.  Neither the statutory provisions authorizing the FAA grants, the relevant appropriations \nN\nN\nE 18 acts, nor any other legislation authorizes the FAA or DOT to condition the granting of these funds on the \nR\n19 recipient’s certification that it does not “promote DEI,” its admission that its compliance with this \n20 prohibition is material for purposes of the FCA, or its agreement to “cooperate” with federal immigration \n21 enforcement efforts.  Federal grant recipients are required to comply with nondiscrimination and other \n22 applicable federal laws.  But executive orders and letters from agency heads cannot change what these \n23 laws require under existing court decisions.  \n24 301.  In sum and as further explained below, the FAA Discrimination Condition, the FAA \n25 Enforcement Condition, the FAA EO Condition, the FAA Termination Condition (collectively, the “FAA \n26 Grant Conditions”), including in the 2025 Grant Assurances, FAA AIG Grant Template, and any other \n27 agreement, template, assurances, or other terms and conditions, violate the Separation of Powers, the \n28 Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti- commandeering principle, and the Fifth Amendment’s \n    -74-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 75 of 108\n1 void-for-vagueness doctrine. \n2 4.  HHS and its Operating Divisions and Agencies Attach New Conditions to \n3 HHS Grants \n4 302.  HHS and its operating divisions and agencies have implemented President Trump’s \n5 Executive Orders by making changes to HHS policy and attaching new and unlawful conditions \n6 (collectively, the “HHS Grant Conditions”) across the expansive portfolio of HHS grants established by \n7 Congress and demanding grant recipients’ agreement to those new conditions. \n8 303.  For example, on April 16, 2025, HHS issued an updated HHS Grants Policy Statement \n9 (2025 HHS GPS) applicable to discretionary grants that is “incorporated by reference in the official \n10 Notice of Award (NoA) as a standard term and condition.”  It applies to “awards and award \n11 modifications that add funding made on or after April 16, 2025,” includes “supplements to award, \n12 competing and non-competing continuations,” and applies to “all HHS recipients and the requirements \n13 flow down to subrecipients.”  The 2025 HHS GPS “is incorporated by reference as a standard term and \n14 condition of awards.”  The 2025 HHS GPS states that it does not apply to nondiscretionary awards, but \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 that “HHS agencies have the discretion to apply certain parts of the GPS to non-discretionary awards and \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 other policies to” non-discretionary awards.4 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 304.  The 2025 HHS GPS imposed a new condition on HHS grants implementing President \nN\nN\nE 18 Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to condition federal grant funds on recipients’ agreement \nR\n19 not to promote DEI and to concede this requirement is material for purposes of the FCA (“HHS \n20 Discrimination Condition”).  While HHS grants have long required compliance with nondiscrimination \n21 laws and have been subject to the FCA, the 2025 HHS GPS states that in addition to filing Form HHS \n22 690 (Assurance of Compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws, which was previously required \n23 under older versions of the GPS), “recipients must comply with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination \n24 laws material to the government’s payment decisions for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 372(b)(4).”  Further, \n25 the 2025 HHS GPS states that “By accepting the grant award, recipients are certifying that . . . [t]hey do \n26 not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or \n27\n \n28 4 The 2025 HHS GPS does not apply to NIH grant awards. \n    -75-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 76 of 108\n1 promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws . . \n2 . .” For this purpose, the following definitions apply: \n3 (a) DEI means “diversity, equity, and inclusion.”  \n4 (b) DEIA means “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.” \n5 (c) Discriminatory equity ideology has the meaning set forth in Section \n2(b) of Executive Order 14190 of January 29, 2025. \n6\n. . . . \n7\n(e) Federal anti-discrimination laws means Federal civil rights law that \n8 protect individual Americans from discrimination on the basis of race, \ncolor, sex, religion, and national origin.  \n9  \n10 305.  In July 2025, HHS released a revised 2025 GPS in which all mention of DEI was \n11 removed. Instead, the updated 2025 GPS simply stated, “By applying for or accepting federal funds . . . \n12 recipients certify compliance with all federal antidiscrimination laws and that complying with those laws \n13 is a material condition.” This revised version became effective as of July 24, 2025. \n14 306.  However, recently, HHS released an updated 2025 GPS, effective on October 1, 2025, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 doubling down on the imposition of new conditions. The 2025 GPS states that “[a]ll recipients subject to \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Title IX requirements must also adhere to the following term.” The terms referenced are as follows: \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Bdrya wacdcoewptni nogf  tahwisa radw faurndd, sin, crelucdipiniegn tth cee rotbifliiegsa taiso nfo, lelxopwesn: diture, or \nN\nN\nE 18\nR •  Recipient is compliant with Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972, as amended, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq., including \n19\nrequirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled \nDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring \n20\nBiological Truth to the Federal Government, and Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq., and recipient \n21\nwill remain compliant for the duration of the Agreement.  \n22\n•  The above requirements are conditions of payment that go the \nessence of the Agreement are therefore material terms of the \n23\nAgreement. \n24\n•  Payments under the Agreement are predicated on compliance with \nthe above requirements, and therefore Recipient is not eligible for \n25\nfunding under the Agreement or to retain any funding under the \nAgreement absent compliance with the above requirements. \n26\n•  Recipient acknowledges that this certification reflects a change in \n27\nthe government’s position regarding the materiality of the foregoing \nrequirements and therefore any prior payment of similar claims \n28\n    -76-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 77 of 108\ndoes not reflect the materiality of the foregoing requirements to this \n1 Agreement. \n2 •  Recipient acknowledges that a knowing false statement relating to \nRecipient’s compliance with the above requirements and/or \n3 eligibility for the Agreement may subject Recipient to liability \nunder the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, and/or criminal \n4 liability, including under 18 U.S.C. §§ 287 and 1001.  \n5\n307.  Furthermore, the newest 2025 GPS warns that Recipients who knowingly make false \n6\nstatements “relating to Recipient’s compliance with the above requirements and/or eligibility for the \n7\nAgreement may subject Recipient to liability under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, and/or \n8\ncriminal liability, including under 18 U.S.C. §§ 287 and 1001.” \n9\n308.  In addition to these agency-wide conditions, several HHS operating divisions and \n10\nagencies have issued their own requirements.  For example, CDC recently issued updated general terms \n11\nand conditions for both research and non-research awards.  Those updated general terms and conditions \n12\nincorporate the 2025 HHS GPS as applicable grants policy with which recipients must comply. \n13\n309.  SAMHSA recently issued updated general terms and conditions for discretionary grants.  \n14\n P\nU Those updated general terms and conditions incorporate the 2025 HHS GPS as applicable grants policy \nO\nGRw  15\nW La with which recipients must comply.  Moreover, in April 2025, SAMHSA updated its Notice of Funding \nLLIC Aeys at  16 Opportunity (NOFO) Application Guide to state that “[a]ll activities proposed in your application and \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN budget narrative must be in alignment with the current Executive Orders” (the “SAMHSA EO \nN\nE 18\nR\nCondition”) and that “[f]unds cannot be used to support or provide services, either directly or indirectly, \n19\nto removable or illegal aliens” (the “SAMHSA Immigration Condition”). \n20\n310.  On July 25, 2025, HRSA issued updated general terms and conditions applicable to “all \n21\nactive awards.”  The revised HRSA terms and conditions incorporate the 2025 HHS GPS as applicable \n22\ngrants policy with which recipients must comply.  They also contain the following provision (the “HRSA \n23\nGender Ideology Condition”): \n24\nBy accepting this award, including the obligation, expenditure, or \n25 drawdown of award funds, recipients, whose programs, are covered by \nTitle IX certify as follows: \n26\n•  Recipient is compliant with Title IX of the Education Amendments \n27 of 1972, as amended, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq., including the \nrequirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled \n28 Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and \n    -77-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 78 of 108\nRestoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government, and Title VI \n1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq., and \nRecipient will remain compliant for the duration of the Agreement. \n2\n•  The above requirements are conditions of payment that go the \n3 essence of the Agreement and are therefore material terms of the \nAgreement. \n4\n•  Payments under the Agreement are predicated on compliance with \n5 the above requirements, and therefore Recipient is not eligible for \nfunding under the Agreement or to retain any funding under the \n6 Agreement absent compliance with the above requirements.  \n7 •  Recipient acknowledges that this certification reflects a change in \nthe government’s position regarding the materiality of the foregoing \n8 requirements and therefore any prior payment of similar claims \ndoes not reflect the materiality of the foregoing requirements to this \n9 Agreement. \n10 •  Recipient acknowledges that a knowing false statement relating to \nRecipient’s compliance with the above requirements and/or \n11 eligibility for the Agreement may subject Recipient to liability \nunder the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, and/or criminal \n12 liability, including under 18 U.S.C. §§ 287 and 1001.  \n13 311.  It is not clear if HRSA’s assertion that compliance with Title IX (or any other \n14 nondiscrimination law) purportedly now requires agreement to the Gender Ideology Order is shared by \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 other HHS operating divisions and agencies, or is implicitly imported into other operating divisions and \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 agencies’ conditions requiring compliance with nondiscrimination laws that do not expressly contain this \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 added gloss. \nN\nN\nE 18 312.  Meanwhile, on May 6, 2025, HHS sent a “Dear Colleague” letter to medical schools \nR\n19 receiving federal funds, providing “[HHS’s] current interpretation of federal law.”  Regarding DEI, the \n20 letter stated “some American educational institutions . . . have adopted race-conscious policies under a \n21 broader umbrella of concepts known as ‘systemic and structural racism’ and ‘diversity, equity, and \n22 inclusion’ (DEI) to incorporate race-based criteria into training and discipline,” and “[a]dditionally, \n23 certain DEI programs may confer advantages or impose burdens based on generalizations associated with \n24 racial identity, rather than evaluating individuals on their own merits.  Such programs can create a hostile \n25 environment, denying a student the ability to participate fully in school life because of the student’s \n26 race.” The letter also warned that institutions “found to be out of compliance with federal civil rights law \n27 may, consistent with applicable law, be subject to investigation and measures to secure compliance with \n28 may, if unsuccessful, affect continued eligibility for federal funding” and stated HHS would “prioritize \n    -78-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 79 of 108\n1 investigations” of institutions that, among other things, require DEI or diversity statements in connection \n2 with hiring.

In a May 14, 2025 statement to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n6 Pensions regarding President Trump’s FY 2026 budget, HHS Secretary Kennedy stated, among other \n7 things, that HHS is “committed to restoring a tradition of gold-standard, evidence based science—not \n8 one driven by politicized DEI, gender ideology, nor sexual identity.”  Secretary Kennedy also stated that \n9 “NIH will no longer issue grants to promote radical gender ideology to the detriment of America’s youth, \n10 or fund dangerous gain-of-function research, though related research will continue consistent with \n11 Administration policy and oversight.  Our Administration is committed to eliminating radical gender \n12 ideologies that poison the minds of Americans.”  Statement by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on the President’s \n13 Fiscal Year 2026 Budget before Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (May 14, 2025), \n14 https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/b1b74b8b-0612-8b5d-1904-\n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 a50babc1deea/HELP%20Secretary%20Kennedy%20Testimony.pdf.  \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 314.  Neither the statutory provisions creating the HHS grants described in this Complaint, the \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 relevant appropriations acts, nor any other legislation authorizes HHS, itself or through its operating \nN\nN\nE 18 divisions and agencies, to condition these funds on the recipient’s certification that it does not “promote” \nR\n19 DEI or gender ideology or its admission that its compliance with these prohibitions is material for \n20 purposes of the FCA.  Nor are Plaintiffs aware of any statute authorizing HHS, itself or through its \n21 operating divisions and agencies, to impose such conditions on any other HHS grants that Plaintiffs have \n22 previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive.  Federal grant recipients must \n23 comply with nondiscrimination and other federal laws.  But executive orders and statements from agency \n24 heads cannot change what these laws require under existing court decisions. \n25 315.  In sum and as further explained below, the HHS Grant Conditions violate the Separation \n26 of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle, the Fifth \n27 Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the APA.  \n28\n    -79-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 80 of 108\n1 5.  EPA Attaches New Conditions to EPA Grants \n2 316.   EPA and its operating divisions and agencies have implemented President Trump’s \n3 Executive Orders by attaching new and unlawful conditions (collectively, the “EPA Grant Conditions”) \n4 across the expansive portfolio of EPA grants established by Congress and demanding grant recipients’ \n5 agreement to those new conditions. \n6 317.  For example, on April 3, 2025, EPA issued an updated General Terms and Conditions, \n7 which included a new condition that states:  \n8 By accepting this EPA financial assistance agreement, (A) the recipient \nagrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n9 discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment decisions for \npurposes of [the Federal Claims Act]; and (B) the recipient certifies that it \n10 does not operate any programs promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \nthat violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. \n11  \n12 U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, EPA General Terms and Conditions effective October 1, 2024 or later, \n13 https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-\n14 10/fy_2025_epa_general_terms_and_conditions_effective_october_1_2024_or_later.pdf.  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 318.  The revised EPA General Terms and Conditions impose this new condition on EPA grants \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 implementing President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to condition federal grant funds \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 on recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede this requirement is material for purposes of \nN\nN\nE 18 the FCA (“EPA Discrimination Condition”).  While EPA grants have long required compliance with \nR\n19 nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the FCA, executive orders and letters from agency \n20 heads cannot change what the laws require under existing court decisions.  The EPA Discrimination \n21 Condition requiring recipients to certify that compliance “in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n22 discrimination laws” is always “material” for purposes of the FCA, is unauthorized by Congress and \n23 unconstitutionally vague.  Furthermore, “materiality,” under the FCA, “is a functional rather than \n24 formulistic, inquiry” that requires courts to evaluate three factors, only one of which is whether the \n25 government’s payment was conditioned on compliance.  See United States ex rel. Bashir v. Boeing Co., \n26 765 F. Supp. 3d 1111, 1128–29 (W.D. Wash. 2025).  To determine materiality, a court also considered \n27 the government’s past enforcement of the requirement and the magnitude of the violation.  Id.  \n28 Accordingly, the EPA Discrimination Condition imposes an impermissibly vague legal standard that is \n    -80-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 81 of 108\n1 broader than the statute allows. \n2 319.  In sum and as further explained below, the EPA Grant Conditions violate the Separation \n3 of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle, the Fifth \n4 Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the APA.  \n5 6.  The New Grant Conditions Implementing and Incorporating the Executive \n6 Orders Are Unlawful \n7 a.  Incorporation of the Executive Orders is Unlawful \n8 320.  The conditions discussed above purport to incorporate executive orders as governing the \n9 use of federal funds.  These orders in many ways purport to adopt new laws by presidential fiat, amend \n10 existing laws, and overturn court precedent interpreting laws.  In so doing, the new grant conditions seek \n11 to usurp Congress’s prerogative to legislate and its power of the purse, as well as the judiciary’s power to \n12 say what the law means. \n13 321.  Furthermore, the executive orders are the President’s directives to federal agencies.  These \n14 orders are unintelligible and vague as applied to grant recipients, and as implemented in the unlawful \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 conditions at issue.   \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 322.  Without Congress passing his anti-DEI agenda, President Trump purports to have granted \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 himself unchecked Article II powers to legislate by executive order and impose his decrees on state and \nN\nN\nE 18 local governments seeking grant funding. \nR\n19 b.  The Discrimination Condition is Unlawful \n20 323.  While Plaintiffs have routinely certified compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws \n21 as a condition of federal funding in the past, the Trump Administration’s communications to federal \n22 grant recipients make clear that the agencies seek compliance with the Trump Administration’s novel, \n23 incorrect, and unsupported interpretation of federal nondiscrimination law as barring any and all DEI \n24 programs.  The Trump Administration’s conception of an “illegal” DEI program is contrary to actual \n25 nondiscrimination statutes and is inconsistent with what any court has endorsed when interpreting them.   \n26 324.  For instance, a February 5, 2025 letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi to DOJ \n27 employees states that DOJ’s Civil Rights Division will “penalize” and “eliminate” “illegal DEI and \n28 DEIA” activities and asserts that such activities include any program that “divide[s] individuals based on \n    -81-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 82 of 108\n1 race or sex”—potentially reaching affinity groups or teaching about racial history.  Letter from Pam \n2 Bondi, Attorney General, to all DOJ Employees (Feb. 5, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/ \n3 1388501/dl?inline.   \n4 325.  Defendant Turner has stated that “HUD is carrying out Present Trump’s executive orders, \n5 mission, and agenda,” by “[a]lign[ing] all programs, trainings, and grant agreements with the President’s \n6 Executive Orders, removing diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI).” Press Release No. 25-059, HUD \n7 Delivers Mission-Minded Results in Trump Administration’s First 100 Days, https://www.hud.gov/news/ \n8 hud-no-25-059 (emphasis added). \n9 326.  Neither the text of Title VI nor any other statute or other condition enacted by Congress \n10 prohibits recipients of federal funding from considering issues of diversity, equity, or inclusion.  The \n11 Supreme Court has never interpreted Title VI to prohibit diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.  \n12 Indeed, existing case law rejects the Trump Administration’s expansive views on nondiscrimination law \n13 with respect to DEI.  The President has no authority to declare, let alone change, federal \n14 nondiscrimination law by executive fiat.  Yet, the DEI Order seeks to impose his views on DEI as if they \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 were the law by using federal grant conditions and the threat of FCA enforcement to direct and coerce \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 federal grant recipients into acquiescing in his Administration’s unorthodox legal interpretation of \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 nondiscrimination law.  \nN\nN\nE 18 327.  Accepting these conditions would permit Defendants to threaten Plaintiffs with \nR\n19 burdensome and costly enforcement action, backed by the FCA’s steep penalties, if they refuse to align \n20 their activities with President Trump’s political agenda.  This threat is intensified by the grant conditions \n21 that purport to have recipients concede the DEI certification’s “materiality”—an otherwise “demanding” \n22 element of an FCA claim.  Further, even short of bringing a suit, the FCA authorizes the Attorney \n23 General to serve civil investigative demands on anyone reasonably believed to have information related \n24 to a false claim—a power that could be abused to target grant recipients with DEI initiatives the Trump \n25 Administration disapproves of.  See 31 U.S.C. § 3733. \n26 328.  The FCA is intended to discourage and remedy fraud perpetrated against the United \n27 States—not to serve as a tool for the Executive to impose unilateral changes to nondiscrimination law, \n28 which is instead within the province of Congress in adopting the laws and the Judiciary in interpreting \n    -82-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 83 of 108\n1 them.  Requiring recipients to certify that compliance “in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n2 discrimination laws” is always “material” for purposes of FCA imposes an impermissibly vague standard \n3 that is broader than the statute allows. \n4 c.  The Immigration Enforcement Condition is Unlawful \n5 329.  Congress has not delegated to Defendants the authority to condition grant funding on a \n6 recipient’s agreement not to “promot[e] . . . illegal immigration” or “abet[] policies that seek to shield \n7 illegal aliens from deportation.”  It is also unclear what type of conduct this might encompass, leaving \n8 federal grant recipients without fair notice of what activities would violate the prohibition and giving \n9 federal agencies free rein to arbitrarily enforce it. \n10 330.  Indeed, on April 24, 2025, Judge William H. Orrick of the United States District Court for \n11 the Northern District of California preliminarily enjoined the federal government from “directly or \n12 indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds from” sixteen cities and \n13 counties on the basis of Section 2(a)(ii) of the Immigration Order, which directs that no “Federal \n14 payments” be made to states and localities if the “effect,” even unintended, is to fund activities that the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Administration deems to “facilitate” illegal immigration or “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies.”  City & \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 25-CV-01350- WHO, 2025 WL 1186310 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2025).  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 The court ruled that the direction “to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funding apportioned to \nN\nN\nE 18 localities by Congress, violate[s] the Constitution’s separation of powers principles and the Spending \nR\n19 Clause”; “violate[s] the Fifth Amendment to the extent [it is] unconstitutionally vague and violate[s] due \n20 process”; and “violate[s] the Tenth Amendment because [it] impose[s] [a] coercive condition intended to \n21 commandeer local officials into enforcing federal immigration practices and law.”  Id. at *2. \n22 d.  The Verification Condition is Unlawful  \n23 331.  Further, PRWORA does not authorize the Verification Condition for at least two reasons.  \n24 First, PRWORA explicitly does not require states to have an immigration status verification system until \n25 twenty-four months after the Attorney General promulgates certain final regulations.  8 U.S.C. § 1642(b).  \n26 Those regulations must, among other things, establish procedures by which states and local governments \n27 may verify eligibility and procedures for applicants to prove citizenship “in a fair and nondiscriminatory \n28 manner.”  Id. § 1642(b)(ii), (iii).  The Attorney General has issued interim guidance and a proposed \n    -83-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 84 of 108\n1 verification rule, but has not implemented a final rule.  See Interim Guidance on Verification of \n2 Citizenship, Qualified Alien Status and Eligibility Under Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and \n3 Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, 62 Fed. Reg. 61344 (Nov. 17, 1997); Verification of \n4 Eligibility for Public Benefits, 63 Fed. Reg. 41662 (Aug. 4, 1998) (proposed rule).  This failure to \n5 promulgate a final regulation left in place DOJ’s Interim Guidance, which requires only the examination \n6 of identity and immigration documentation.  62 Fed. Reg. at 61348–49.  Absent implementing \n7 regulations, Plaintiffs are not required to verify participants’ immigration status using SAVE or an \n8 equivalent verification system.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1320b-7.  Requiring recipients to do so exceeds the \n9 authority created in PRWORA. \n10 332.  Second, SAVE is a database operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, \n11 acting through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, that is sometimes used to assist federal \n12 immigration enforcement actions.  The Verification Condition would require Plaintiffs to gain access to \n13 this system, train their own employees how to use the system, and require them to enter immigration \n14 information.  Such an effort to commandeer local resources for matters related to federal immigration \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 enforcement is counter to federal law, as well as applicable local and state laws precluding local \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 participation in federal immigration enforcement. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 e.  The Gender Ideology Condition is Unlawful  \nN\nN\nE 18 333.  The Gender Ideology Condition improperly seeks to force federal grant recipients to no \nR\n19 longer recognize transgender, gender diverse, and intersex people by restricting funding that promotes \n20 “gender ideology.”  This violates HUD’s own regulations, which require that grant recipients and \n21 subrecipients ensure “[e]qual access to CPD programs, shelters, other buildings and facilities, benefits, \n22 services, and accommodations is provided to an individual in accordance with the individual’s gender \n23 identity, and in a manner that affords equal access to the individual’s family,” including facilities with \n24 “shared sleeping quarters or shared bathing facilities.”  24 C.F.R. § 5.106(b)–(c).  HUD regulations also \n25 prohibit subjecting an individual “to intrusive questioning or asked to provide anatomical information or \n26 documentary, physical, or medical evidence of the individual’s gender identity.” Id. § 5.106(b)(3). \n27 334.  While Defendant Turner announced HUD will no longer enforce these regulations, the \n28 regulations remain in effect and applicable to the CPD programs. \n    -84-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 85 of 108\n1 335.  The Gender Ideology Condition is also vague.  The definition of “gender ideology” is not \n2 only demeaning, but also idiosyncratic and unscientific.  Further, given the expansive meaning of \n3 “promote,” federal agencies have free rein to punish recipients who merely collect information on gender \n4 identity, which has long been authorized and encouraged by HUD in its binding regulations, as such \n5 information can be used to improve the quality and efficacy of homeless services. \n6 336.  The Trump Administration has already terminated federal funding as a result of agency \n7 action carrying out the Gender Ideology Order and related executive orders.  For example, one of the \n8 largest free and reduced-cost healthcare providers in Los Angeles reported that the U.S. Centers for \n9 Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) terminated a $1.6 million grant that would have supported the \n10 clinic’s transgender health and social health services program.  The CDC ended the grant in order to \n11 comply with the Gender Ideology Order.  See Kristen Hwang, LA clinics lose funding for transgender \n12 health care as Trump executive orders take hold, Cal Matters (Feb. 4, 2025), https://calmatters.org/health/ \n13 2025/02/trump-executive-order-transgender-health/.  \n14 337.  On February 28, 2025, Judge Lauren King of the United States District Court for the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Western District of Washington enjoined enforcement of the Gender Ideology Order in part (including \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 parts the Gender Ideology Condition it incorporates by references), holding that the plaintiffs had shown \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 a likelihood of success on their claims that the Order violates the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal \nN\nN\nE 18 protection and the separation of powers.  Washington v. Trump, 768 F. Supp. 3d 1239, 1261-77 (W.D. \nR\n19 Wash. 2025). \n20 338.   Particularly relevant here, the Court ruled that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in \n21 showing that “[b]y attaching conditions to federal funding that were . . . unauthorized by Congress,” \n22 subsections 3(e) and (g) of the Gender Ideology Order “usurp Congress’s spending, appropriation, and \n23 legislative 11 powers.”  Id. at *1261.  The Court explained that the Gender Ideology Order “reflects a \n24 ‘bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group’” by “deny[ing] and denigrat[ing] the very existence of \n25 transgender people.”  Id. at 1277 (citation omitted). \n26 f.  The Abortion Condition is Unlawful \n27 339.  The Abortion Condition (including the Abortion Order incorporated by reference) does \n28 not implement, but rather exceeds, the Hyde Amendment’s narrow prohibition on using federal funds to \n    -85-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 86 of 108\n1 pay for, or require others to perform or facilitate, abortions.  While it purports to apply the Hyde \n2 Amendment—a provision that has been enacted in successive appropriations acts that limits the use of \n3 federal funds for abortions (subject to narrow exceptions)—in reality, it goes well beyond the Hyde \n4 Amendment.  The Hyde Amendment to the 2024 Appropriations Act specifically and narrowly prohibits \n5 the use of appropriated funds to “require any person to perform, or facilitate in any way the performance \n6 of, any abortion” or to “pay for an abortion, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if \n7 the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape or incest.” Pub. L. 118-42, §§ 202, 203, 138 Stat. 25 \n8 (March 9, 2024).  But the Hyde Amendment to the 2024 Appropriations Act does not require grant \n9 recipients to refrain from “promot[ing] abortion”—a vague prohibition that is susceptible to arbitrary \n10 enforcement.  And in doing so, the Abortion Condition usurps Congress’s spending, appropriations, and \n11 legislative power.  In sum and as further explained below, Defendants’ imposition of the Abortion \n12 Condition violates the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void- for-\n13 vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n14 340.  In sum and as further explained below, Defendant’s imposition of the EO Grant \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Conditions violates the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void- for-\nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 F.  Multiple Courts Have Issued Injunctions Preventing the Imposition of the Unlawful \nN\nN\nE 18 Grant Conditions  \nR\n19 341.  Since President Trump issued the executive orders directing federal agencies to impose \n20 new conditions on grant funding and terminate funding for noncompliance, numerous plaintiffs—\n21 including states, cities, and nonprofit organizations—have filed lawsuits seeking to enjoin the \n22 implementation of these directives.  In response, courts across the country have granted preliminary \n23 injunctions to halt enforcement of these unlawful conditions while litigation proceeds.  See e.g. Chicago \n24 Women in Trades v. Trump, No. 25 C 2005, 2025 WL 1114466 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 14, 2025); City & Cnty. of \n25 San Francisco v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01350-WHO, 2025 WL 1186310 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2025), \n26 opinion clarified, No. 25-CV-01350-WHO, 2025 WL 1358492 (N.D. Cal. May 9, 2025); S. Educ. Found. \n27 v. United States Dep’t of Educ., No. CV 25-1079 (PLF), 2025 WL 1453047 (D.D.C. May 21, 2025); \n28 Martin Luther King, Jr. Cnty. v. Turner, No. 2:25-CV-814, 2025 WL 1582368 (W.D. Wash. June 3, \n    -86-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 87 of 108\n1 2025); San Francisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01824-JST, 2025 WL 1621636 (N.D. Cal. \n2 June 9, 2025). \n3 342.  On July 2, 2025, presumably in response to the numerous injunctions granted against \n4 DOT and HUD, DOT Secretary Sean Duffy sent another letter to all recipients of DOT funding, \n5 attempting to walk back his earlier statements in the April Duffy Letter (described in paragraphs 85 and \n6 86 above).  The July Duffy Letter states: \n7 “I write to clarify that the Department will no longer enforce [Biden’s \nexecutive policies], or any other requirements incorporated into its Federal \n8 financial assistance agreements that are inconsistent with the policy \nobjectives of this Administration and current DOT leadership…This letter \n9 does not impose new conditions or requirements, but instead serves merely \nto provide notice that DOT will not enforce or require adherence to any of \n10 the [Biden executive policies]” \n11 Letter from Sean Duffy, DOT Secretary, to All Recipients of DOT Funding (July 2, 2025) (“July Duffy \n12 Letter”), https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-07/SecDOT%20letter%20to%20 \n13 recipients%20of%20FFA%2007022025.pdf.   \n14 343.  The July Duffy Letter directly contradicts his earlier April Letter, the Executive Orders, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 and the June 5th Letter from Claudette Fernandez.  Furthermore, the July letter completely ignores the \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 provisions of Trump’s Executive Orders, which Defendants have implemented, that directs each federal \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 agency head to include “in every contract or grant award” a term that the contractor or grant recipient \nN\nN\nE 18 “certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI,” and directs all agency heads to ensure \nR\n19 “that Federal payments to States and localities do not, by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or \n20 promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens \n21 from deportation.”    \n22 344.  The conditions placed on HUD and DOT funding require more than compliance with pre-\n23 existing law.  The DEI Order, the Immigration Order, and subsequent agency letters broadly reinterpret \n24 the law to prohibit all DEI and require affirmative cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, \n25 indicating these new conditions are not reflective of existing law and instead are intended to further the \n26 Trump administration’s policy goals—not Congress’s.   \n27 345.  Although the July Duffy Letter purports to “clarify” the Department’s position, it does not \n28 retract or disavow the Administration’s prior threats to vigorously enforce its sweeping and unlawful \n    -87-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 88 of 108\n1 interpretation of federal law.  Nowhere does the July Duffy Letter state that DOT will cease enforcing \n2 this Administration’s novel, overbroad, and contradictory interpretation of federal law, nor does it \n3 acknowledge the numerous official statements by federal officials warning that noncompliance with \n4 these policies will result in the loss of funding.   \n5 G.  Plaintiffs, as Recipients of Pass-Through Grants, have a Reasonable Concern that \n6 the Challenged Conditions Apply to them \n7 346.  Local government entities that receive federal grant funds may receive the funds directly \n8 from a federal agency (as a direct recipient) or indirectly from a pass-through entity (as a sub-recipient).  \n9 Where a pass-through entity (for example, a state) provides federal funds to a sub- recipient (for \n10 example, a city or county within the state), the pass-through entity is responsible for ensuring the sub-\n11 recipient complies with applicable federal requirements.  See 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.332(b)(2) (pass-through \n12 entity must provide to the sub-recipient information regarding “[a]ll requirements of the subaward, \n13 including requirements imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the \n14 Federal award”), 200.332(e) (pass-through entity must “[m]onitor the activities of a subrecipient as \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 necessary to ensure that the subrecipient complies with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 conditions of the subaward”); 2 C.F.R. Part 2400 (incorporating 2 C.F.R. Part 200 requirements with \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 respect to federal awards made by HUD to non-federal entities); 2 C.F.R. Part 1201 (same for DOT).  \nN\nN\nE 18 347.  Consistent with 2 CFR § 200.332, the grant agreements and terms and conditions at issue \nR\n19 in this case incorporate applicable federal requirements against any sub-recipients.  \n20 348.  For example, the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions require that the recipient \n21 “monitor activities under this award, including activities under subawards and contracts, to ensure … that \n22 those activities comply with this agreement,” and state that “[i]f the Recipient makes a subaward under \n23 this award, the Recipient shall monitor the activities of the subrecipient in compliance with 2 C.F.R. \n24 200.332(e).”  Exhibit A to the 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions—which incorporates the DEI \n25 and Gender Ideology Orders and two criminal immigration statutes as “applicable provisions” as \n26 discussed above—states that “[p]erformance under this agreement shall be governed by and in \n27 compliance with the following requirements, as applicable, to the type of organization of the Recipient \n28 and any applicable sub-recipients.”  The 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions, the Exhibits \n    -88-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 89 of 108\n1 thereto, as well as the 2025 FAA Grant Assurances and FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template, contain \n2 similar language.   \n3 349.  The FTA Master Agreement requires that grant recipients take measures to assure that \n4 “Third Party Participants” (defined to include sub-recipients) “comply with applicable federal laws, \n5 regulations, and requirements, and follow applicable federal guidance, except as FTA determines \n6 otherwise in writing.”  \n7 350.  Plaintiffs receive federal grant funds via pass-through grants (i.e., as sub-recipients) and \n8 has a reasonable concern, based on the April Duffy Letter, applicable regulations, and the grant \n9 agreement language discussed above, that the challenged grant conditions apply to their use of the pass-\n10 through funds. \n11 H.  Plaintiffs face an Impossible Choice of Accepting Illegal Conditions, or Forgoing \n12 Federal Grant Funding for Critical Programs and Services \n13 351.  The grant conditions that Defendants seek to impose leave Plaintiffs with the Hobson’s \n14 choice of accepting illegal conditions that are unauthorized by Congress, violate the Constitution, and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 accompanied by poison pill provisions that increase the risk of FCA claims, or forgoing the grant \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 funds—funds paid (at least partly) through local federal taxes—that are essential for vital local services.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 The uncertainty caused by these illegal conditions has impeded Plaintiffs’ ability to budget and plan for \nN\nN\nE 18 services covered by the grants.  \nR\n19 352.  Defendants’ overbroad interpretation and enforcement of the EO Conditions is not \n20 hypothetical.  On or around August 18, 2025, the City of Fresno received an email from HUD notifying it \n21 “that the Department is questioning the accuracy of the City of Fresno’s certification that the Community \n22 Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds described in its Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action \n23 Plan (the Plan) will be administered in conformity with applicable laws, including Executive Orders.”  In \n24 the email, HUD explained that it had “identified language in Fresno’s 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action \n25 Plan “that is not consistent with Executive Order 14148 Additional Rescissions of Harmful Executive \n26 Orders and Actions, Executive Order 14151 Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs \n27 and Preferencing, Executive Order 14173 Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based \n28 Opportunity, and Executive Order 14168 Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and \n    -89-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 90 of 108\n1 Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”  Specifically, HUD took issue with the \n2 following statements from Fresno’s 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action Plan: \n3 “The DRIVE Plan has goals to improve housing affordability and stability, \nreduce racial and economic isolation and support environmental justice \n4 and sustainability, most of which are addressed in the strategic plan.”  \n5 “Emergency shelter for all genders and their dependent children who \nare fleeing domestic violence.” (emphasis added by HUD). \n6\n353.  HUD stated that “[t]his language includes provisions that appear to be inconsistent with \n7\nthe implementation of federal programs pursuant to the referenced executive orders, and directed Fresno \n8\nto “[r]emove or replace all ‘equity’ references throughout the document,” “[r]emove or replace all \n9\n“environmental justice” references throughout the document,” “[r]emoving all “transgender” references \n10\nthroughout the document,” and provide assurances that “[t]he City of Fresno shall not use grant funds to \n11\npromote ‘gender ideology,’ as defined in Executive Order (E.O.) 14168, Defending Women from Gender \n12\nIdeology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”   \n13\n354.  HUD directed Fresno to take these actions no later than 12:00 pm EDT Thursday, August \n14\n P\nU 21, 2025, and provided that “failure to address HUD’s concerns regarding the certification may result in \nO\nGRw  15\nW La HUD determining that the certification is inaccurate or unsatisfactory, which will result in disapproval of \nLLIC Aeys at  16 the Plan.” \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN 355.  Plaintiffs, the City of Redwood City, City of Saint Paul, and the County of Marin have \nN\nE 18\nR\nreceived similar notices from HUD.   \n19\n356.  Additionally, Defendants’ unlawful conduct has already occurred, causing delay and \n20\nuncertainty in Plaintiffs’ budgeting and long-term planning processes.  Furthermore, the deadlines for \n21\nPlaintiffs to submit assurances and agreements containing the unlawful conditions to Defendants are \n22\nimminent.   \n23\n357.  For example, on or around August 14, 2025, the City of Fresno received an additional \n24\nGrant Offer and Agreement letter from the FAA regarding an ATP grant.  The Grant Offer included the \n25\n2025 FAA Grant Assurances, which, as discussed above, incorporate the unlawful EO Conditions, as \n26\n“provisions” purportedly “applicable” to grant agreements.

Additionally, Fresno has already spent $13 million of FAA funding allocated for Fresno’s \n4 use on FAT’s terminal expansion project.  Those funds are set to expire on September 30, 2025.  If \n5 Fresno and the other FAA Plaintiffs do not submit for reimbursement by the end of September, which \n6 requires assuring compliance with the 2025 FAA Grant Assurances, they will lose out on millions of \n7 previously allocated federal funds.   \n8 359.  Fresno was also recently awarded a Brownfields and Land Revitalization RFL grant of \n9 $750,000 on August 5, 2025, with the mailing date of August 8, 2025.  For an RFL grant, the recipient \n10 demonstrates its commitment to carry out the award by either drawing down funds within 21 days after \n11 the EPA award or amendment mailing date.  Additionally, the City of Fresno has received notice from \n12 the EPA that it intends to award the City an additional grant that will also be subject to the unlawful EO \n13 Conditions. \n14 360.  Nor is the heightened FCA risk merely speculative.  A May 19, 2025, letter from Deputy \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Attorney General Todd Blanche to certain DOJ divisions and offices and all U.S. Attorneys states that \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 DOJ is setting up a “Civil Rights Fraud Initiative”—co-led by DOJ’s Civil Fraud Section and Civil \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Rights Division—that will “utilize the [FCA] to investigate and, as appropriate, pursue claims against \nN\nN\nE 18 any recipient of federal funds that knowingly violates civil rights laws.”  The letter asserts the FCA “is \nR\n19 implicated whenever federal-funding recipients or contractors certify compliance with civil rights laws \n20 while knowingly engaging in racist preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities, including \n21 through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that assign benefits or burdens on race, ethnicity, \n22 or national origin.”  It further states that the Civil Fraud Section and Civil Rights Division will “engage \n23 with the Criminal Division, as well as with other federal agencies that enforce civil rights requirements \n24 for federal funding recipients” (including HUD) and “will also establish partnerships with state attorneys \n25 general and local law enforcement to share information and coordinate enforcement actions.”  Finally, \n26 the letter states that DOJ “strongly encourages” private lawsuits under the FCA and “encourages anyone \n27 with knowledge of discrimination by federal-funding recipients to report that information to the \n28 appropriate federal authorities so that [DOJ] may consider the information and take any appropriate \n    -91-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 92 of 108\n1 action.”  Letter from Todd Blanche, Deputy Attorney General, to DOJ Offices, 19 Divisions, and U.S. \n2 Attorneys (May 19, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/dag/media/1400826/dl?inline.  \n3 361.  Withholding HUD grants from the HUD Plaintiffs could result in a loss of millions of \n4 dollars in funding for housing and other services that Plaintiffs have adopted to meet the basic needs of \n5 their residents.  It would result in Plaintiffs being unable to serve their residents resulting in the loss of \n6 access to housing, healthcare, counseling, and other assistance.  This funding represents a significant \n7 percentage of those Plaintiffs’ total budgets for housing and community support programs, including \n8 community development and infrastructure improvements, affordable housing creation and rehabilitation, \n9 and homelessness services such as outreach, shelter, prevention, and rapid re-housing.  The loss of this \n10 funding would have devastating effects on Plaintiffs and their residents.  \n11 362.  Withholding DOT grants from Plaintiffs would result in the loss of hundreds of millions \n12 of dollars in funding for critical services and projects for their residents.   \n13 363.  Withholding FTA grants from the FTA Plaintiffs would result in the loss of funding for \n14 public transit services, including capital projects, maintenance, and improvements, which would cause \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 long-lasting harm to Plaintiffs’ finances and lead to delays in or the elimination of critical transit projects.  \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 The loss of this funding, which represents a significant percentage of those Plaintiffs’ total budgets for \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 public transit services, would threaten transit improvements and safety initiatives and have severe \nN\nN\nE 18 negative impacts on these services. \nR\n19 364.  Withholding FHWA grants from the FHWA Plaintiffs would result in the loss of funding \n20 for street and roadway improvements, including enhancing pedestrian safety, reconfiguring major \n21 roadways to decrease crashes and improve transit, and building bike lanes, that will result in long-lasting \n22 harm to Plaintiffs’ finances, delays to or elimination of critical infrastructure and safety projects, and \n23 diversion of funds from other crucial local projects.  The loss of this funding, which represents a \n24 significant percentage of those Plaintiffs total budgets for street and roadway projects, would threaten \n25 roadway improvement and safety initiatives and have severe negative impacts on these projects. \n26 365.  Withholding FAA grants from the FAA Plaintiffs would result in the loss of funding for \n27 ongoing and future airport projects—including development and improvement of runways, taxiways, \n28 terminals, and control tower as well as airport transit, safety, and sustainability projects—that will result \n    -92-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 93 of 108\n1 in long-lasting harm to those Plaintiffs’ finances, delays to or elimination of critical airport infrastructure \n2 and safety projects, and diversion of funds from other crucial projects.  The loss of this funding, which \n3 represents a significant percentage of those Plaintiffs’ total budgets for airport development and \n4 infrastructure projects, would threaten airport improvement and safety initiatives and have severe \n5 negative impacts on these critical projects. \n6 366.  Withholding HHS grants from the HHS Plaintiff would threaten or eliminate critical \n7 individual and public health services for millions of residents.  Loss of funding could decimate public \n8 health budgets and cause residents, including those most vulnerable, to lose access to meals, medical \n9 care, housing, and lifesaving social safety net services.  Loss of funding could also devastate local public \n10 health and child welfare agencies, which may be forced to conduct significant layoffs and operational \n11 reductions. \n12 367.  Withholding EPA grants from the EPA Plaintiffs would result in the loss of funding for \n13 environmental protection and infrastructure projects, including brownfields mitigation and sustainability \n14 development, which would cause long-lasting harm to Plaintiffs’ finances and lead to delays in or \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 elimination of critical environmental and public health projects.  The loss of this funding would have \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 severe negative impacts on public health and environmental safety. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 368.  The prospective loss of these federal funds would be so catastrophic to Plaintiffs’ finances \nN\nN\nE 18 that the essential services it provides—including housing support, public transportation, street and \nR\n19 roadway safety improvements, and airport operations—would be effectively halted.  Plaintiffs cannot \n20 replace these funds with local revenue without drastically cutting other critical services or abandoning \n21 their obligations to vulnerable populations.  Yet agreeing to the vague, unauthorized, and contradictory \n22 grant conditions—even if Plaintiffs were to make a good faith effort to revise their policies to comply—\n23 would expose them to significant liability.  Certifying compliance with these conditions carries an \n24 intolerable risk of enforcement under the False Claims Act, and constitutional and statutory challenges \n25 from stakeholders who could assert that Plaintiffs have adopted discriminatory or otherwise unlawful \n26 policies in violation of their rights.  Plaintiffs thus face an impossible dilemma: either accept legal \n27 jeopardy by complying with the conditions, or forfeit funding that is essential to the health, safety, and \n28 well-being of their residents. \n    -93-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 94 of 108\n1 V.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n2 Count 1: Separation of Powers \n(All Grant Conditions) \n3\n4 369.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though \n5 fully set forth herein. \n6 370.  The Constitution “exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \n7 President.”  City & Cnty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018).  This power is \n8 “directly linked to [Congress’s] power to legislate,” and “[t]here is no provision in the Constitution \n9 that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  Id. (second alteration in \n10 original) (quoting Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998)). \n11 371.  The Constitution vests Congress—not the Executive—with legislative powers, see \n12 U.S. Const. art. 1, § 1, the spending power, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1, and the appropriations \n13 power, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 9, cl. 7.  Absent an express delegation, only Congress is entitled to \n14 attach conditions to federal funds.  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 372.   “The Framers viewed the legislative power as a special threat to individual liberty, so \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 they divided that power to ensure that ‘differences of opinion’ and the ‘jarrings of parties’ would \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 ‘promote deliberation and circumspection’ and ‘check excesses in the majority.’”  Seila Law LLC v. \nN\nN\nE 18 Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 223 (2020) (quoting The Federalist No. 70, at 475 (A. \nR\n19 Hamilton) and citing id., No. 51, at 350). \n20 373.  “As Chief Justice Marshall put it, this means that ‘important subjects … must be \n21 entirely regulated by the legislature itself,’ even if Congress may leave the Executive ‘to act under \n22 such general provisions to fill up the details.’”  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 737 (2022) \n23 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (quoting Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42–43, 6 L. Ed. 253 (1825)). \n24 374.  The separation of powers doctrine thus represents perhaps the central tenet of our \n25 Constitution.  See, e.g., Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 637–38 (2024); West Virginia v. \n26 EPA, 597 U.S. at 723–24; Seila Law LLC, 591 U.S. at 227; see also Clinton v. City of New York, \n27 524 U.S. 417, 450 (1998) (“Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to \n28 transgress the separation of powers” (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  Consistent with these principles, \n    -94-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 95 of 108\n1 the executive acts at the lowest ebb of his constitutional authority and power when he acts contrary \n2 to the express or implied will of Congress.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, \n3 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n4 375.  Pursuant to the separation of powers doctrine, the Executive Branch may not “claim[] \n5 for itself Congress’s exclusive spending power, . . . [or] coopt Congress’s power to legislate.”  City \n6 & Cnty. of S.F., 897 F.3d at 1234.  Indeed, the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the \n7 President to notify and request authority from Congress to rescind or defer the expenditure of funds \n8 before acting to withhold or pause federal payments.  2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq.  The President has not \n9 done so. \n10 376.  Congress has not conditioned the provision of Defendants’ grants on compliance with \n11 a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification \n12 of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  \n13 Nor has Congress delegated to Defendants the authority to attach the EO Grant Conditions \n14 unilaterally. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 377.  By imposing the EO Grant Conditions on grant recipients, Defendants are unilaterally \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 attaching new conditions to federal funding without authorization from Congress.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 378.  Further, the “[t]he interpretation of the meaning of statutes, as applied to justiciable \nN\nN\nE 18 controversies,” is “exclusively a judicial function.”  Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 \nR\n19 U.S. 369, 411–13 (2024) (internal quotations omitted). \n20 379.  Here, Defendants seek to impose conditions that purport to require compliance with \n21 the law interpreted and envisioned by the Executive, contrary to Congress’s authority to legislate \n22 and the Judiciary’s interpretation of the law’s meaning. \n23 380.  For these reasons, Defendants’ conditioning of grants on compliance with the EO \n24 Grant Conditions violates the separation of powers doctrine.  \n25 Count 2: Spending Clause \n(All Grant Conditions) \n26  \n27 381.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n28 set forth herein. \n    -95-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 96 of 108\n1 382.  The Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress”—not the \n2 Executive—”shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts \n3 and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States …”  U.S. Const. art. I, \n4 § 8, cl. 1. \n5 383.  As described above, Defendants violate the separation of powers because the EO Grant \n6 Conditions are neither expressly nor impliedly authorized by Congress.  For the same reasons, \n7 Defendants violate the Spending Clause.  \n8 384.  The Spending Clause also requires States to have fair notice of conditions that apply to \n9 federal funds disbursed to them.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 25 (1981).  \n10 The grant conditions must be set forth “unambiguously.”  Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. \n11 Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006). \n12 385.  Moreover, funding restrictions may only impose conditions that are reasonably related to \n13 the federal interest in the project and the project’s objectives.  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207, 208 \n14 (1987). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 386.  Finally, federal funds “may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities that \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 would themselves be unconstitutional.”  Id. at 210. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 387.  Even if Congress had delegated authority to the Executive and HUD, DOT, HHS, or EPA \nN\nN\nE 18 to condition grant funding on terms prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \nR\n19 immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n20 ideology” or “elective abortion.”, the EO Grant Conditions would violate the Spending Clause by: \n21 a.  imposing conditions that are ambiguous, see Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17; \n22 b.  imposing conditions that are so severe as to be coercive; \n23 c.  imposing conditions that are not germane to the stated purpose of grant program funds, \n24 see Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (“[C]onditions on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are \n25 unrelated ‘to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs.’”); and  \n26 d.  with respect to the prohibition on promotion of “gender ideology,” imposing a condition \n27 that purports to require grant recipients to act unconstitutionally by discriminating on the \n28 basis of gender identity and sex, see id. at 210. \n    -96-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 97 of 108\nCount 3: Tenth Amendment \n1 (All Grant Conditions) \n \n2\n388.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n3\nset forth herein. \n4\n389.  The Tenth Amendment provides that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by \n5\nthe Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the \n6\npeople.”  U.S. Const. amend X. \n7\n390.  Legislation that “coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own” “runs \n8\ncontrary to our system of federalism.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577–78 \n9\n(2012).  States must have a “legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for \n10\nfederal funds.”  Id. at 578. \n11\n391.  Even if Congress had delegated authority to the Executive or Defendants to condition \n12\ngrant funds on any policy that “promotes” the Administration’s conception of an “illegal” DEI program \n13\nor on participation in the Administration’s enforcement of federal immigration laws, the EO Grant \n14\n P\nU Conditions would violate the Tenth Amendment by imposing conditions so severe as to coerce recipients \nO\nGRw  15\nW La of such funds to adopt the Administration’s reinterpretation of the law.  See id. at 579 (Congress may not \nLLIC Aeys at  16 impose conditions so severe that they “cross[] the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion.”).   \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN Count 4: Fifth Amendment Due Process – Vagueness  \nN\nRE 18 (All Grant Conditions) \n19 392.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n20 set forth herein. \n21 393.  Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, a governmental enactment, like \n22 an executive order, is unconstitutionally vague if it “fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair \n23 notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory \n24 enforcement.”  United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008). \n25 394.  The EO Grant Conditions are unconstitutionally vague. \n26 395.  Initially, each of the EO Conditions is vague in purporting to incorporate all executive \n27 orders.  Executive orders are the President’s directives to federal agencies and do not apply to federal \n28 grant recipients.  The purported incorporation of all executive orders into the recipient or sponsor’s use of \n    -97-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 98 of 108\n1 grant funds renders the other new grant conditions vague.  \n2 396.  Each of the Discrimination Conditions fails to clearly define what conduct is prohibited \n3 and fails to specify clear standards for enforcement.  This uncertainty is amplified by agency letters and \n4 statements, including the April Duffy Letter and Turner statements, that conflict with federal statutes and \n5 case law. \n6 397.  The HUD Enforcement Condition (which incorporates by reference the Immigration \n7 Order) fails to define the terms “facilitates,” “subsidization,” or “promotion” with respect to “illegal \n8 immigration,” leaving federal grant recipients without fair notice of what would violate the prohibition. \n9 398.  Similarly, each of the DOT Enforcement Conditions fails to define the terms “cooperate,” \n10 “cooperating,” “impeding,” and “enforcement” with respect to “Federal immigration law,” leaving \n11 federal grant recipients without fair notice of what would violate the prohibition. \n12 399.  Similarly, the FAA Termination Condition does not define “the public interest” or “the \n13 interests of the FAA” that would support a termination decision or expressly limit those interests to the \n14 funding of airport development or infrastructure, leaving federal grant recipients without fair notice of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 what would trigger termination of their grants. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 400.  The definition of “gender ideology” adopted in the Gender Ideology Condition is so vague \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 as to require people of ordinary intelligence to guess as to what is prohibited.  By the same token, the \nN\nN\nE 18 Gender Ideology Condition affords unfettered discretion to Defendants to determine, based on their \nR\n19 subjective interpretation, whether a federal grant is used to “promote gender ideology.”   \n20 401.  The meaning of the phrase “promote elective abortion” is also vague, leaving federal grant \n21 recipients without fair notice of what activities would violate the prohibition and affording Defendants \n22 unfettered discretion.  \n23 402.  The vague terms and conditions described above are likely to chill individuals from \n24 engaging in First Amendment-protected speech on matters of public concern \n25 403.  Thus, the EO Grant Conditions are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth \n26 Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n27\n28\n    -98-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 99 of 108\n1 Count 5: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \n2 Arbitrary and Capricious \n(All Grant Conditions) \n3\n4 404.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n5 set forth herein. \n6 405.  Defendant HUD, HHS, EPA, and DOT, as well as the DOT operating administrations (the \n7 FTA, the FHWA, and the FAA), are all “agenc[ies]” as defined in the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  \n8 Additionally, the HUD Grant Agreements, the FTA Master Agreement, the FY 2024 SS4A General \n9 Terms and Conditions, the 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions, the 2025 FAA Grant \n10 Assurances, the FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template, HHS’s revised Grants Policy Statement, and the \n11 EPA’s updated General Terms and Conditions are all agency actions subject to review under the APA.   \n12 406.  Final agency actions (1) “mark the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decision making \n13 process” and (2) are ones “by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,’ or from which ‘legal \n14 consequences will flow.’”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 407.  The HUD Grant Agreements are final agency actions because they reflect final \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 decisions—in accord with presidential directives—to require grant recipients to comply with various \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Trump Administration policy priorities as a condition to receiving federal HUD funds.  See State ex rel. \nN\nN\nE 18 Becerra v. Sessions, 284 F. Supp. 3d 1015, 1031–32 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (holding that agency decision to \nR\n19 impose new conditions on federal grants satisfies both tests for final agency action because it \n20 “articulate[s] that certain funds” will “require adherence to the” new conditions and “opens up the \n21 [recipient] to potential legal consequences,” including withholding of funds if the recipient declines to \n22 accept the conditions); Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 337 \n23 F. Supp. 3d 308, 328–29 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (same). \n24 408.  Similarly, the FTA Master Agreement, the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions, \n25 the 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions, the 2025 FAA Grant Assurances, the FY 2025 FAA \n26 AIG Grant Template, HHS’s revised Grants Policy Statement, and the EPA’s updated General Terms and \n27 Conditions are final agency actions because they reflect final decisions—in accord with presidential \n28 directives—to require grant recipients to comply with various Administration policy priorities as a \n    -99-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 100 of 108\n1 condition to receiving federal funds. \n2 409.  These actions determine rights and obligations and produce legal consequences because \n3 they exercise purported authority to create new conditions on already awarded funds that would obligate \n4 recipients to comply with the Executive’s policy priorities. \n5 410.  Under the APA, a “court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n6 and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n7 accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n8 411.  “An agency action qualifies as ‘arbitrary’ or ‘capricious’ if it is not ‘reasonable and \n9 reasonably explained.’”  Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024) (quoting FCC v. Prometheus Radio \n10 Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021)).  A court must therefore “ensure, among other things, that the agency \n11 has offered ‘a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between the facts \n12 found and the choice made.’”  Id. (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm \n13 Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  “[A]n agency cannot simply ignore ‘an important \n14 aspect of the problem’” addressed by its action.  Id. at 293. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 412.  HUD has provided no reasoned explanation for its decision to impose conditions related to \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verifying immigration \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 status, and prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” and “elective abortion” on HUD funds \nN\nN\nE 18 that have no connection to those issues. \nR\n19 413.  HUD has provided no reasoned basis for withholding funds Congress appropriated for \n20 disbursement, except to the extent the HUD Grant Agreements make clear HUD is enacting the \n21 President’s policy desires, as expressed in Executive Orders 14168, 14173, 14182, and 14218, in place of \n22 Congress’s intent. \n23 414.  HUD also ignores essential aspects of the “problem” it purports to address via the CPD \n24 programs, including the Plaintiff’s reasonable and inevitable reliance on now at-risk funds, the \n25 expectation of reimbursement from already appropriated funds, and the potential impacts on low-income \n26 and homeless individuals and families who may be dissuaded from accepting services if they must verify \n27 their immigration status or are unable to use their identified gender in doing so. \n28\n    -100-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 101 of 108\n1 415.  Similarly, neither DOT nor its OAs have provided any reasoned basis for anti-DEI-related \n2 conditions to the FTA, FHWA, and FAA grants, seeking to impose the Administration’s view on all \n3 policies and programs, even when they are unrelated to programs receiving such grants.  Moreover, DOT \n4 and its EOs failed to explain how Plaintiffs could simultaneously comply with each of the DOT \n5 Discrimination Conditions, while also complying with statutory, regulatory, and other requirements that \n6 are in apparent tension with those Conditions. \n7 416.  Nor has HHS or the EPA provided a reasoned basis for imposing conditions related to \n8 “cooperation” with federal immigration enforcement on federal funds that have no connection to that \n9 issue. \n10 417.  Defendants have also ignored Plaintiffs’ reasonable reliance on awarded, but not yet \n11 obligated, funds and the expectation of reimbursement from already appropriated funds. \n12 418.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n13 that Defendants imposing the EO Grant Conditions violates the APA because it is arbitrary and \n14 capricious; provide preliminary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and preliminarily and permanently enjoin \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Defendants from imposing those Conditions without complying with the APA.  \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Count 6: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Contrary to the Constitution  \nN (All Grant Conditions) \nN\nE 18\nR\n19 419.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n20 set forth herein. \n21 420.  Under the APA, a “court shall … hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n22 and conclusions found to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. \n23 § 706(2)(B).  \n24 421.  As described above, Defendants’ imposition of the EO Grant Conditions violates bedrock \n25 constitutional provisions and principles, including the separation of powers between the President and \n26 Congress, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment. \n27 422.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n28 that Defendants imposing the EO Grant Conditions violates the APA because it is contrary to \n    -101-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 102 of 108\n1 constitutional rights, powers, privileges, or immunities; provide preliminary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; \n2 and preliminary and permanently enjoin Defendants from imposing those Conditions without complying \n3 with the APA.  \n4 Count 7: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \n5 In Excess of Statutory Authority  \n(All Grant Conditions) \n6\n7 423.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n8 set forth herein. \n9 424.  Under the APA, a “court shall … hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n10 and conclusions found to be … in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \n11 statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n12 425.  Defendants may exercise only authority granted to them by statute or the Constitution. \n13 426.  No law or provision of the Constitution authorizes Defendants to impose extra- statutory \n14 conditions not authorized by Congress on congressionally-appropriated funds. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 427.  Neither the Housing and Community Development Act, the Cranston-Gonzalez National \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Affordable Housing Act, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the AIDS Housing \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Opportunity Act nor any other legislation authorizes HUD to impose conditions on HUD grant funding \nN\nN\nE 18 related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification \nR\n19 of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”. \n20 428.  Similarly none of the statutes authorizing the HHS, EPA, FTA, FHWA, and FAA grants, \n21 nor the relevant appropriations acts, authorize Defendants to impose conditions on federal funding \n22 prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of \n23 immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”. \n24 429.  Indeed, by threatening to unilaterally withhold funds on the basis of unauthorized agency-\n25 imposed grant conditions, Defendants attempts to circumvent the process established in the \n26 Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which requires the President to notify and request authority from \n27 Congress to rescind or defer the expenditure of funds before acting to withhold or pause federal \n28 payments.  2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq. \n    -102-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 103 of 108\n1 430.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n2 that Defendants imposing the EO Grant Conditions violates the APA because it is in excess of \n3 Defendants’ statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; provide \n4 preliminary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from \n5 imposing those Conditions without complying with the APA.  \n6 Count 8: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \n7 Agency Action Contrary to Regulation \n(HUD Grant Conditions) \n8\n9 431.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n10 set forth herein. \n11 432.  Under the APA, a “court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n12 and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n13 accordance with law” or “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n14 433.  The NOFOs under which Plaintiffs were awarded HUD funding for FY 2024 contain no \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 terms or conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 immigration laws, verifying immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 “elective abortion.”  \nN\nN\nE 18 434.  By imposing new terms and conditions on the HUD Grant Agreements not included in the \nR\n19 NOFO or authorized elsewhere, HUD failed to comply with its own regulations governing the formation \n20 of CPD grant agreements and failed to observe the procedure required by law. \n21 435.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n22 that imposing the HUD Grant Conditions violates the APA because it is contrary to HUD’s own \n23 regulations and thus not in accordance with law and without observance of procedure required by law; \n24 provide preliminary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and preliminarily and permanently enjoin HUD from \n25 imposing the HUD Grant Conditions without complying with the APA. \n   \n26\n27\n28\n    -103-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 104 of 108\n1 Count 9: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \n2 Agency Action Without Procedure Required By Law \n(HUD, FTA, and FFA Grant Conditions) \n3\n4 436.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n5 set forth herein. \n6 437.  Under the APA, a “court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n7 and conclusions found to be . . . without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n8 § 706(2)(D). \n9 438.  An agency “must abide by its own regulations.”  Fort Stewart Schs. v. Fed. Labor Rels. \n10 Auth., 495 U.S. 641, 654 (1990). \n11 439.  HUD has adopted regulations requiring it to proceed by notice-and-comment rulemaking \n12 including for “matters that relate to . . . grants.”  24 C.F.R. § 10.1 (“It is the policy of the Department of \n13 Housing and Urban Development to provide for public participation in rulemaking with respect to all \n14 HUD programs and functions, including matters that relate to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 contracts . . . .”); 24 C.F.R. § 10.2 (definition of “rule”); 24 C.F.R. §§ 10.7–10.10 (notice-and-comment \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 procedures); Yesler Terrace Cmty. Council v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 442, 447, 448 (9th Cir. 1994). \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 440.  The FTA is subject to statutory notice-and-comment requirements for certain statements \nN\nN\nE 18 pertaining to grants issued under title 49, chapter 53 of the U.S. Code (including the FTA Grants).  \nR\n19 Specifically, “[t]he Administrator of the [FTA] shall follow applicable rulemaking procedures under \n20 section 553 of title 5 before the [FTA] issues a statement that imposes a binding obligation on recipients \n21 of Federal assistance under this chapter.”  49 U.S.C. § 5334(k)(1).  For this purpose, “binding obligation” \n22 means “a substantive policy statement, rule, or guidance document issued by the [FTA] that grants rights, \n23 imposes obligations, produces significant effects on private interests, or effects a significant change in \n24 existing policy.”  Id. § 5334(k)(2). \n25 441.  The FTA, and the FAA have also adopted regulations requiring those agencies to proceed \n26 by notice-and-comment rulemaking when they promulgate substantive rules.  See 49 C.F.R. \n27 §§ 601.22(a), 601.24–601.28 (FTA); 14 C.F.R. Part 11 (FAA). \n28\n    -104-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 105 of 108\n1 442.  Through the HUD Grant Conditions, HUD has not just continued preexisting \n2 requirements to comply with nondiscrimination laws and the other types of conditions approved by and \n3 consistent with the relevant statutes and regulations, but also attached new conditions on HUD Grant \n4 Agreements that require grant recipients to comply with various Administration directives as a condition \n5 to receiving federal funds.  These new conditions thus comprise a substantive rule, not an interpretive \n6 rule or general statement of policy.  See, e.g., Yesler Terrace Cmty. Council, 37 F.3d at 449 (“Substantive \n7 rules … create rights, impose obligations, or effect a change in existing law pursuant to authority \n8 delegated by Congress.”); Erringer v. Thompson, 371 F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir. 2004) (explaining that a \n9 rule is substantive, i.e., “legislative,” inter alia, if there is no “adequate legislative basis for enforcement \n10 action” without the rule, or if the rule “effectively amends a prior legislative rule”). \n11 443.  In imposing the HUD Grant Conditions, HUD failed to comply with the notice-and-\n12 comment requirements set forth in its own regulations, and thus failed to observe the procedure required \n13 by law. \n14 444.  Through the FTA and FAA Grant Conditions the FTA and the FAA have not just \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 continued preexisting requirements to comply with nondiscrimination laws and the other types of \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 conditions approved by and consistent with the relevant statutes and regulations, but attached new terms \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 and conditions to FTA and FAA Grants that require grant recipients to comply with various \nN\nN\nE 18 Administration directives as a condition to receiving federal transit, and airport funds, which are \nR\n19 substantive policy statements, rules, or guidance documents that impose obligations or effect significant \n20 changes in existing policy, not interpretive rules or general statements of policy. \n21 445.  In imposing the FTA Grant Conditions, the FTA failed to comply with the notice- and-\n22 comment requirements set forth in 49 U.S.C. § 5334(k)(1) and its own regulations, and thus failed to \n23 observe procedure required by law. \n24 446.  In imposing the FAA Grant Conditions, the FAA failed to comply with the notice- and-\n25 comment requirements set forth in its own regulations, and thus failed to observe procedure required by \n26 law.  \n27 447.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n28 that imposing the HUD Grant Conditions, the FTA Grant Conditions, and the FAA Grant Conditions \n    -105-   \n   \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - CASE NO.: 3:25-CV-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 35     Filed 09/08/25     Page 106 of 108\n1 violates the APA because it is without observance of procedure required by law; provide preliminary \n2 relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and preliminary and permanently enjoin Defendants from imposing those \n3 Conditions without complying with the APA. \n4 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n5 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief: \n6 A.

INTRODUCTION \n2 Plaintiffs now move for a preliminary injunction to preserve the status quo and prevent the U.S. \n3 Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the U.S. Department of Transportation \n4 (“DOT”)—including the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”), Federal Highway Administration \n5 (“FHWA”), and Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”)—the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n6 Services (“HHS”), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) (collectively, “Defendants”) \n7 from enforcing unlawful and unauthorized conditions imposed on critical federal grant programs.  In \n8 granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, this Court recognized both the imminent \n9 and irreparable harm Plaintiffs face in being compelled to accept these unlawful and unauthorized \n10 conditions or forgo critical federal funding, and Plaintiffs’ strong likelihood of success on the merits of \n11 their constitutional and statutory claims.  See Dkt. 27 (Minute Order Granting Motion for TRO); see also \n12 Dkt. 28 (Order Granting Motion for TRO).  Those findings remain equally true today and apply equally \n13 to the new plaintiffs (the County of San Diego, County of Marin, City of Alameda, and City of Redwood \n14 City) who have joined the First Amended Complaint. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 The grant conditions at issue—imposed without statutory authority, in disregard of the U.S. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Constitution, and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act—threaten hundreds of millions of \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 dollars in essential funding that Plaintiffs depend on to provide core public services and maintain vital \nN\nN\nE 18 transportation and infrastructure systems.  Plaintiffs cannot comply with these vague and unauthorized \nR\n19 conditions without exposing themselves to substantial legal liability, nor can they forgo critical federal \n20 funds without severe and immediate consequences for their communities. \n21 Because the TRO is set to expire on September 23, 2025, a preliminary injunction is necessary to \n22 ensure that Defendants are enjoined from imposing or enforcing the unlawful conditions, or any \n23 materially similar conditions, throughout the duration of this litigation.  Only such relief will preserve the \n24 status quo, prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and their residents, and protect against further unlawful \n25 executive overreach while this case proceeds to final judgment. \n26 II.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n27 A.  Defendants Unilaterally Impose New Conditions on Federal Grant Funds \n28 Following President Trump’s inauguration, he issued a series of executive orders (“EOs”) \n-1- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 16 of 56\n1 directing executive agencies to impose new conditions on federal grants.  These EOs include EO \n2 No. 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs \n3 and Preferencing); EO No. 14168, 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 30, 2025) (Defending Women from Gender \n4 Ideology Extremism); EO No. 14173, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 31, 2025) (Ending Illegal Discrimination \n5 and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity); EO No. 14182, 90 Fed. Reg. 8751 (Jan. 31, 2025) (Enforcing \n6 the Hyde Amendment); EO No. 14218, 90 Fed. Reg. 10581 (Feb. 19, 2025) (Ending Taxpayer \n7 Subsidization of Open Borders); EO No. 14287, 90 Fed. Reg. 18761 (Apr. 28, 2025) (Protecting \n8 American Communities From Criminal Aliens); and EO No. 14332, 90 Fed. Reg. 38929 (Aug. 7, 2025) \n9 (Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking).  Pursuant to these EOs and other policy directives, \n10 Defendants have incorporated new conditions into grant programs’ terms and conditions and agreements. \n11 1.  HUD Conditions  \n12 In or around April 2025, HUD revised its General Administrative, National, and Departmental \n13 Policy Requirements and Terms for HUD’s Financial Assistance Programs (“General HUD Terms”) to \n14 require recipients of HUD grant funding to comply with all existing and future EOs, including those \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 enumerated above.  See Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Ex. A.  The General HUD Terms require \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 that “[r]ecipients of Federal Awards must comply with applicable existing and future Executive Orders, \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 as advised by the Department, including but not limited to” a “non-exhaustive list” of nine executive \nN\nN\nE 18 orders, including the EOs related to DEI, gender ideology, immigration, and elective abortions.  Id. at 10 \nR\n19 (the “HUD EO Condition”).  The General HUD Terms also provide, “[n]o state or unit of general local \n20 government that receives HUD funding under [sic] may use that funding in a manner that by design or \n21 effect facilitates the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration or abets policies that seek to shield \n22 illegal aliens from deportation.”  Id. at 2 (the “HUD Immigration Enforcement Condition”).   \n23 HUD’s revised General Terms were followed by public statements affirming the agency’s \n24 commitment to the President’s agenda.  On or about May 15, 2025, Defendant Turner stated that “HUD \n25 is carrying out President Trump’s EOs, mission, and agenda,” by “[a]lign[ing] all programs, trainings, \n26 and grant agreements with the President’s EOs, removing diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI).”  RJN, Ex. \n27 B, Press Release No. 25-059, at 4. \n28 In or around June 2025, HUD distributed a revised HUD-424B Assurances and Certifications \n-2- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 17 of 56\n1 form.  The HUD-424B form is a required certification document for applicants and recipients of \n2 Continuum of Care (“CoC”) grants and grants administered through HUD’s Office of Community \n3 Planning and Development (“CPD”), including the Community Development Block Grant (“CDBG”), \n4 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (“HOME”), and Emergency Solutions Grants (“ESG”) \n5 Program.  The revised HUD-424B form includes conditions that were not included in the FY 2024 or FY \n6 2025 Notices of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”) and are not authorized by the statutory provisions \n7 governing the grant programs.  Specifically, the revised form requires recipients to assure that they \n8 “[w]ill not use Federal funding to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) mandates, policies, \n9 programs, or activities that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.”  See RJN, Ex. C at 1 \n10 (the “HUD DEI Condition”).  Recipients of HUD grants were already required to comply with all federal \n11 anti-discrimination laws.  The legal effect of the HUD DEI Condition prohibiting recipients from \n12 “promot[ing]” DEI policies “or” any applicable anti-discrimination law appears to impose an additional \n13 condition beyond existing applicable law.   \n14 On June 5, 2025, CPD General Deputy Assistant Secretary Claudette Fernandez issued a letter, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 “[o]n behalf of Secretary Scott Turner,” to the executive directors of two organizations representing \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 states and local jurisdictions that administer CPD grant programs.  See RJN, Ex. Q (“Fernandez Letter”).  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 The Fernandez Letter “encouraged” grantees “to review the White House Executive Orders as they \nN\nN\nE 18 develop their consolidated plan and annual action plans” to ensure “conformity with applicable \nR\n19 Administration priorities and executive orders.”  Id. at 2.  The Fernandez Letter provided that “[u]nder \n20 the FY 2025 grant agreement, conformity means that a grantee…shall not use grant funds to promote \n21 ‘gender ideology,’ as defined in [the Gender Ideology EO]” (the “HUD Gender Ideology Condition”), \n22 must “agree[] that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is \n23 material to the U.S. Government’s payment decisions for purposes of [the FCA].”  Id.  And that grant \n24 recipients must agree that they will “not use any grant funds to fund or promote elective abortions, as \n25 required by E.O. 14182.”  Id. (the “HUD Elective Abortion Condition”). \n26 In March 2025, HUD began circulating new CoC grant agreements that included additional grant \n27 conditions not included in the FYs 2024 & 2025 NOFOs.  See e.g. Warhuus Decl., Ex. A.  The CoC \n28 Grant Agreements state that “[t]his Agreement, the Recipient’s use of funds provided under this \n-3- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 18 of 56\n1 Agreement … , and the Recipient’s operation of projects assisted with Grant Funds” are “governed by … \n2 all current Executive Orders.”  Id. at 1 (the “CoC EO Condition”).  The CoC Agreements also provide \n3 that the recipient “shall not use grant funds to promote “gender ideology” as defined in E.O. 14168…”  \n4 Id. at 3 (the “CoC Gender Ideology Condition”).  The CoC Agreements also provide that recipients “shall \n5 not use any Grant Funds to fund or promote elective abortions, as required by E.O. 14182…”  Id. (the \n6 “CoC Elective Abortion Condition”).  Additionally, the CoC Agreements require the recipient to \n7 “certif[y] that it does not operate any programs that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination \n8 laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964” and “agrees that its compliance in all respects \n9 with applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the U.S. Government’s payment decisions \n10 for purposes of [the FCA].  Warhuus Decl., Ex. A at 3 (the “CoC Discrimination Condition”). \n11 The CoC Agreements further contain a CoC Immigration Enforcement Condition identical to the \n12 HUD Immigration Enforcement Condition, as well as an additional condition requiring the recipient to \n13 “administer its grant in accordance with all applicable immigration restrictions and requirements, \n14 including the eligibility and verification requirements that apply under title IV of the Personal \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) and any applicable \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 requirements that HUD, the Attorney General, or the U.S. Center for Immigration Services [sic] may \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 establish from time to time to comply with PRWORA, Executive Order 14218, or other Executive Orders \nN\nN\nE 18 or immigration laws.”  Warhuus Decl., Ex. A at 3.  The CoC Agreements further require that” [s]ubject \nR\n19 to the exceptions provided by PRWORA, the recipient must use [Systematic Alien Verification for \n20 Entitlements (SAVE)], or an equivalent verification system approved by the Federal government, to \n21 prevent any Federal public benefit from being provided to an ineligible alien who entered the United \n22 States illegally or is otherwise unlawfully present in the United States.”  Id. (the “CoC PRWORA \n23 Verification Condition”). \n24 Defendants have unilaterally imposed the HUD EO Condition, the HUD DEI Condition, the HUD \n25 Immigration Enforcement Condition, the HUD Gender Ideology Condition, the HUD Elective Abortion \n26 Condition, the CoC Discrimination Condition, the CoC Elective Abortion Condition, the CoC Gender \n27 Ideology Condition, the CoC EO Condition, the CoC Immigration Enforcement Condition, and the CoC \n28 PRWORA Verification Condition, collectively referred to as the HUD Conditions, on HUD grants relied \n-4- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 19 of 56\n1 upon by Plaintiffs, without prior authorization from Congress.  \n2 2.  DOT Conditions \n3 DOT has similarly revised its grant agreements and assurances.  The FTA, FHWA, and FAA \n4 have all incorporated language into grant conditions requiring compliance with the EOs.  On April 24, \n5 2025, Secretary Duffy sent a letter to transportation agencies nationwide announcing DOT’s new policy \n6 governing the terms of all DOT-funded grants.  See RJN, Ex. P (“April Duffy Letter”).  The letter stated \n7 that it was DOT’s “policy” to impose immigration enforcement and anti-DEI conditions as requirements \n8 for receiving funding and explained that DOT interprets federal nondiscrimination law to presumptively \n9 prohibit “any policy, program, or activity that is premised on a prohibited classification, including \n10 discriminatory policies or practices designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals.”  Id.  The Duffy letter \n11 further declared that recipients’ “legal obligations require cooperation generally with Federal authorities \n12 in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and \n13 Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other Federal offices and components of the Department of Homeland \n14 Security in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.”  Id.  To underscore the seriousness of these \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 new conditions, the letter warned that DOT would “vigorous[ly] enforce[]” compliance, including \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 through “comprehensive audits, claw-back of grant funds, and termination of grant awards,” as well as \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 potential “enforcement actions and loss of any future federal funding from DOT.”  Id.   \nN\nN\nE 18 DOT has incorporated these conditions into its grant agreements.  For example, on May 7, 2025, \nR\n19 Plaintiff City of Saint Paul received an Innovative Finance and Asset Concession (“IFAC”) grant \n20 program Cooperative Agreement from DOT.  See Bacher Decl. ¶¶ 28-31, Ex. 8.  The IFAC Agreement \n21 requires recipients to “cooperate with Federal officials in the enforcement of federal law, including \n22 cooperating with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement (ICE) and other federal \n23 offices and components of the Department of Homeland Security in the enforcement of Federal \n24 immigration law.”  Id., Ex. 8 (the “DOT Immigration Enforcement Condition”).  The IFAC agreement \n25 also requires that the recipient include certain clauses in all subcontracting contracts or agreements, \n26 including a requirement that the subcontractor “comply” with several EOs, including those regarding \n27 gender ideology and DEI.  Id., Ex. 8, Appendix E (the “DOT EO Condition”).  The agreement \n28 specifically provides:   \n-5- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 20 of 56\npursuant to Section (3)(b)(iv)(A) [of the DEI EO], the Recipient agrees that its compliance \n1 in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the \ngovernment’s payment decisions for purposes of [the FCA]; and pursuant to Section \n2 (3)(b)(iv)(B) [of the DEI EO], by entering into this agreement, the Recipient certifies that \nit does not operate any programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) \n3 initiatives that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.   \n4\nId. (the “DOT DEI Condition”).   \n5\nThe DOT’s operating administrations have also included the unlawful conditions in their \n6\nagreements and terms and conditions.  \n7\na.  FTA \n8\nOn March 26, 2025, the FTA issued an updated Master Agreement applicable to all funding \n9\nawards authorized under specified federal statutes.  RJN, Ex. D.  The March 26 Master Agreement \n10\nprovides: \n11\n(1) Pursuant to section (3)(b)(iv)(A), Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal \nDiscrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the Recipient agrees that its \n12\ncompliance in all respects with all applicable Federal antidiscrimination laws is material \nto the government’s payment decisions for purposes of [the FCA]. \n13\n(2) Pursuant to section (3)(b)(iv)(B), Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal \n14\n UP Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, by entering into this Agreement, \nO\nGRw  15 the Recipient certifies that it does not operate any programs promoting diversity, equity, \nW La and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination \nLLIC Aeys at  16 laws. \nPE UBAttorn 17 Id. at 58 (the “FTA DEI Condition”).  It also requires recipients to “comply with other applicable federal \nN\nN nondiscrimination laws, regulations, and requirements, and follow federal guidance prohibiting \nE 18\nR\ndiscrimination.”  Id.  Federal guidance, such as the April Duffy Letter, as well as Defendants’ actual \n19\nenforcement of the DEI Conditions (infra, Section II(B)), shows that these new conditions are broader \n20\nthan existing nondiscrimination law.  These conditions have also been incorporated into FTA’s FY 2025 \n21\nCertifications and Assurances, which require grant recipients to “comply with all applicable requirements \n22\nof all other Federal laws, executive orders, regulations, and policies governing the program under which \n23\nit is applying for assistance.”  See Darrow Decl., Ex. A at 4 (the “FTA EO Condition”).   \n24\nb.  FWHA \n25\nThe FHWA has incorporated similar conditions into its terms and grant agreements.  On April 22, \n26\n2025, the FHWA issued updated Competitive Grant Program General Terms and Conditions applicable \n27\nto all FHWA competitive grants.  RJN Ex. E.  The 2025 FHWA General Terms imposed new conditions \n28\n-6- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 21 of 56\n1 on all FHWA competitive grants, including the BIP, Culvert AOP Program, and ATTAIN programs \n2 utilized by Plaintiffs.  The FHWA General Terms include an FHWA DEI Condition identical to the DOT \n3 DEI Condition discussed above.  Id. at 25.  The FHWA General Terms also contain an FHWA \n4 Immigration Enforcement Condition identical to the DOT Immigration Enforcement Condition.  Id.   \n5 The Exhibits to the 2025 FHWA General Terms, dated April 30, 2025, further require the \n6 recipient to assure and certify that it will “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive \n7 orders, policies, guidelines, and requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of \n8 Federal funds for this Project” RJN Ex. E at 34.  The Exhibits, imposing a condition similar to the DOT \n9 EO Condition discussed above, list President Trump’s EOs regarding DEI and gender ideology (among \n10 other recent Trump Administration executive orders), as well as two criminal immigration statutes (8 \n11 U.S.C. § 1324 and 8 U.S.C. § 1327), as “provisions” purportedly “applicable” to FHWA competitive \n12 grant agreements, with no explanation of how those EOs or statutes relate to highway grants or even \n13 apply to local governments.  Id. (the “FHWA EO Condition”).  FHWA has included identical or similar \n14 conditions in additional program terms and conditions, such as the FY 2024 Safe Streets for All \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 (“SS4A”) General Terms and Conditions.  See RJN Ex. R.  FHWA also retroactively revised the SS4A \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 General Terms and Conditions for 2022 and 2023 to include the same unlawful conditions.  See RJN, Ex. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 S (FY 2023), Ex. T (FY 2022). \nN\nN\nRE 18 c.  FAA \n19 Implementing the April Duffy Letter and the President’s EOs, on April 25, 2025, the FAA issued \n20 a proposal labeled “Notice of modification of Airport Improvement Program grant assurances; \n21 opportunity to comment,” providing notice and soliciting public comment, for a 14-day period,  on \n22 modifications to the Grant Assurances.  See RJN, Ex. G.  In its notice, the FAA stated that the 2025 FAA \n23 Grant Assurances would take effect immediately, notwithstanding the expedited comment period.  The \n24 2025 FAA Grant Assurances are included with all FAA grants and require sponsors1 to assure and certify \n25 that they will “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, policies, \n26\n \n27 1 The FAA refers to grant recipients under its Airport Improvement Program and related funding statutes \nas “sponsors.”  See, e.g., 49 U.S.C. § 47102(26) (defining “sponsor” to mean, in relevant part, a public \n28 agency or private owner that submits an application for financial assistance under the Act). \n-7- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 22 of 56\n1 guidelines, and requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal funds for \n2 this Grant,” specifically incorporating the EOs related to DEI and gender ideology as “provisions” \n3 purportedly “applicable” to grant agreements.  Id. at 2–3 (the “FAA EO Condition”). \n4 On May 6, 2025, FAA posted on its website a revised grant agreement template for 2025 Airport \n5 Infrastructure Grants (“AIG”) with added terms and conditions that did not appear in prior iterations of \n6 FAA grant agreements.  See RJN, Ex. F.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template imposes a new \n7 condition on all AIG grants implementing the directives of the April Duffy Letter.  The FY 2025 FAA \n8 AIG Grant Template contains conditions substantively identical to the DOT DEI Condition (id. at 10–11) \n9 and the DOT Immigration Enforcement Condition (id. at 11), although the language varies slightly.  For \n10 example. the FAA agreements provide: \nPursuant to Section (3)b)(iv), Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and \n11\nRestoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the sponsor: \n12 a. Agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination \nlaws is material to the government’s payment decisions for purposes of 31 U.S.C. \n13 3729(b)(4); and  \nb. certifies that it does not operate any programs promoting diversity, equity, and \n14\n UP inclusion (DEI) initiatives that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. \nO\nGRw  15\nW La Id. at 10–11 (the “FAA DEI Condition”).  The agreements also include a condition identical to the DOT \nLLIC Aeys at  16 Immigration Enforcement Condition, as well as a requirement that sponsors agree to “follow applicable \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN federal laws pertaining to Subchapter 12, and be subject to the penalties set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1324, \nN\nE 18\nR\nBringing in and harboring certain aliens, and 8 U.S.C. § 1327, Aiding or assisting certain aliens to enter” \n19\n(“the “FAA Immigration Condition”).  Id. at 11.  These conditions have been implemented across both \n20\nAIG and Airport Improvement Program (“AIP”) grant agreements.  See, e.g., Moore Decl., Exs. A \n21\n(FY2025 AIP), C (FY2025 AIG).   \n22\nDefendants have unilaterally imposed the DOT EO Condition, the DOT DEI Condition, the DOT \n23\nImmigration Enforcement Condition, the FTA DEI Condition, the FTA EO Condition, the FHWA DEI \n24\nCondition, the FHWA Immigration Enforcement Condition, the FHWA EO Condition, the FAA EO \n25\nCondition, FAA Immigration Condition, and the FAA DEI Condition, collectively referred to as the DOT \n26\nConditions, on grants relied upon by Plaintiffs, without prior authorization from Congress.  \n27\n28\n-8- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 23 of 56\n3.  HHS Conditions \n1\nSimilarly, HHS and its operating divisions and agencies have attached unlawful grant conditions \n2\nacross the expansive portfolio of HHS grants established by Congress, including grants from the Health \n3\nResources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n4\nAdministration (“SAMHSA”), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”).   \n5\nOn April 16, 2025, HHS issued an updated HHS Grants Policy Statement (“April 2025 HHS \n6\nGPS”) that “is incorporated by reference in the official Notice of Award (NoA) as a standard term and \n7\ncondition” and applicable to discretionary grants.  RJN, Ex. H at 3.  The April 2025 HHS GPS applies to \n8\n“awards and award modifications that add funding made on or after April 16, 2025.”  Id.  The April 2025 \n9\nHHS GPS states that “By accepting the grant award, recipients are certifying that . . . [t]hey do not, and \n10\nwill not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote \n11\nDEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws . . . .”  Id. \n12\nat 19.  The April HHS GPS defines DEI to mean “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” DEIA to mean \n13\n“diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” and provides that “[d]iscriminatory equity ideology has \n14\n P\nU the meaning set forth in Section 2(b) of Executive Order 14190 of January 29, 2025.”  Id. at 19 (the \nO\nGRw  15\nW La “April HHS GPS DEI Condition”). \nLLIC Aeys at  16 In July 2025, HHS released a revised 2025 GPS, effective as of July 24, 2025, removing all \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN mention of DEI.  See RJN, Ex. U.  Instead, the updated July GPS simply stated, “By applying for or \nN\nE 18\nR\naccepting federal funds . . . recipients certify compliance with all federal antidiscrimination laws and that \n19\ncomplying with those laws is a material condition.”  Id. at 19 (the “July 2025 HHS GPS Discrimination \n20\nCondition”).  However, recently, HHS again revised its GPS, to become effective on October 1, 2025, \n21\nwhich now provides: \n22\nBy accepting this award, including the obligation, expenditure, or drawdown of award \nfunds, recipient certifies as follows: \n23\n•  Recipient is compliant with Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n24 1972, as amended, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq., including requirements set \nforth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women from \n25 Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal \nGovernment, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \n26 §§ 2000d et seq., and recipient will remain compliant for the duration of \nthe Agreement.  \n27\n•  The above requirements are conditions of payment that go [sic] the essence \nof the Agreement are therefore material terms of the Agreement. \n28\n-9- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 24 of 56\n1 RJN Ex. V, October 2025 HHS GPS at 22 (the “October HHS GPS Gender Ideology Condition”).  The \n2 time at which a specific grant award was issued determines which HHS GPS applies.   \n3 In addition to these department-wide conditions, agencies have issued their own requirements.  In \n4 July 2025, CDC issued updated its General Terms and Conditions for both research and non-research \n5 awards.  The general terms and conditions for research and non-research grants require grant recipients to \n6 “comply with…grants policy contained in applicable HHS Grants Policy Statements…[and] applicable \n7 Executive Orders” without designating which EOs are applicable.  See RJN Ex. W (Research Grants) at \n8 1; id. Ex. X (Non-Research Grants) at 1 (the “CDC EO Condition”).  Both CDC General Terms and \n9 Conditions also include identical provisions that provide: \nBy applying for or accepting federal funds from HHS, recipients certify compliance with \n10\nall federal antidiscrimination laws and these requirements and that complying with those \nlaws is a material condition of receiving federal funding streams. Recipients are \n11\nresponsible for ensuring subrecipients, contractors, and partners also comply. \n12\nRJN Ex. W at 1; id., Ex. X at 1. (the “CDC Discrimination Condition”). \n13\nIn April 2025, SAMHSA updated its Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) Application Guide \n14\n P\nU to state that “[a]ll activities proposed in your application and budget narrative must be in alignment with \nO\nGRw  15\nW La the current Executive Orders” (the “SAMHSA EO Condition”) and that “[f]unds cannot be used to \nLLIC Aeys at  16 support or provide services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens.”  RJN Ex. J at 31 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN (the “SAMHSA Immigration Condition”). \nN\nE 18\nR\nOn July 25, 2025, HRSA issued updated general terms and conditions applicable to “all active \n19\nawards.”  See RJN Ex. Y.  The revised HRSA terms and conditions incorporate the HHS GPS and \n20\ninclude an HRSA Discrimination Condition identical to the CDC Discrimination Condition described \n21\nabove.  The General Terms and individual HRSA Grant Agreements also contain a condition identical to \n22\nthe October HHS GPS Gender Ideology Condition.  Id. at 4; see Lutz Decl., Exs. A-B, D, F– I (the \n23\n“HRSA Gender Ideology Condition”).   \n24\nDefendants have unilaterally imposed the April HHS GPS DEI Condition, the July 2025 HHS \n25\nGPS Discrimination Condition, the October HHS GPS Gender Ideology Condition, the CDC EO \n26\nCondition, the CDC Discrimination Condition, the CDC Discrimination Condition, the SAMHSA EO \n27\nCondition, the SAMHSA Immigration Condition, the HRSA Discrimination Condition, and the HRSA \n28\n-10- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 25 of 56\n1 Gender Ideology Condition, collectively referred to as the HSS Conditions, on grants relied upon by \n2 Plaintiffs, without prior authorization from Congress. \n3 4.  EPA Conditions \n4 The EPA has incorporated similar unlawful DEI Conditions into its General Terms and \n5 Conditions applicable to all EPA grants.  On April 3, 2025, EPA updated its General Terms and \n6 Conditions.  See RJN, Ex. K.  This update included a term that provides: \nBy accepting this EPA financial assistance agreement, (A) the recipient agrees that its \n7\ncompliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material \nto the government’s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, \n8\nUnited States Code; and (B) the recipient certifies that it does not operate any programs \npromoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion that violate any applicable Federal anti-\n9\ndiscrimination laws. \n10\nId. at 44.  On August 25, the EPA again updated its General Terms and revised the last clause of the \n11\nabove-described term to, “the recipient certifies that it does not operate any programs violating any \n12\napplicable Federal antidiscrimination law or promoting any such violation.”  See RJN, Ex. Z, August \n13\n2025 Update at 44 (emphasis added) (EPA DEI Condition).  Defendants have unilaterally imposed the \n14\n P\nU EPA DEI Conditions (“EPA Condition”) on all EPA grants, including the grants relied upon by \nO\nGRw  15\nW La Plaintiffs, without prior authorization from Congress. \nLBLIC Aneys at  16 B.  Plaintiffs Confront Harm and Uncertainty Under Defendants’ Unlawful Federal \nPE UAttor 17 Grant Conditions  \nN\nN\nE 18 Defendants’ grant conditions place Plaintiffs in an untenable position: either accept the vague and \nR\n19 unlawful requirements or forfeit crucial funds that, in many cases, have already been awarded and \n20 incorporated into Plaintiffs’ budgets and planned infrastructure projects.  The loss of these funds would \n21 cause immediate, irreparable, and far-reaching harm.  Moreover, even if Plaintiffs agreed to the \n22 conditions, the lack of clarity in the application of the conditions would leave them exposed to arbitrary \n23 enforcement, unpredictable penalties, and legal liability.  The First Amended Complaint and the \n24 supporting declarations concurrently filed with this motion describe, in greater detail than is possible in \n25 this memorandum, the numerous awarded, pending, and anticipated grant funds on which Plaintiffs rely.  \n26 The discussion below highlights only a few examples and identifies which Plaintiffs receive grant funds \n27 from which Defendants. \n28 Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Eureka, City of Saint Paul, City of Alameda, City of Redwood \n-11- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 26 of 56\n1 City, County of Sacramento, County of Marin, County of San Diego, and County of Monroe \n2 (collectively, the “HUD Plaintiffs”), receive, directly or indirectly, grant funds administered by HUD.  \n3 For example, Fresno receives an annual allocation of approximately $11.7 million in federal funding for \n4 housing and development projects from HUD.  Skei Decl. ¶ 7.  On August 18, 2025, HUD notified \n5 Fresno that its FY 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action Plan would not be approved unless the City removed \n6 references to “equity,” “environmental justice,” and “transgender,” and certified compliance with EO \n7 14168.  Id. ¶¶ 13–14.  When Fresno requested additional time to respond, HUD formally disapproved the \n8 Plan on August 22, 2025, citing unsatisfactory certifications.  As a result, Fresno has been forced to \n9 pause use of CDBG funds pending resolution of this dispute.  Id. ¶ 15.  Plaintiffs the City of Redwood \n10 City, City of Saint Paul, and the County of Marin have received similar notices from HUD.  Diaz Decl. ¶ \n11 15; Bacher Decl. ¶ 19–20; Thomas Decl. ¶ 11.  These grant funds, along with the others detailed in \n12 Plaintiffs’ supporting declarations, are subject to the unlawful HUD Grant Conditions discussed above.  \n13 Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Alameda, City of Eureka, City of South Lake Tahoe, City of \n14 Saint Paul, County of Marin, County of Sacramento, County of San Diego, County of Monroe, and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Monroe Airport Authority (collectively, the “DOT Plaintiffs”), receive grant funds, directly or indirectly, \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 administered by DOT and its operating administrations.  For example, Frederick Douglass Greater \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Rochester International Airport, leased to the Monroe County Airport Authority by the County of \nN\nN\nE 18 Monroe, has applied for over $12 million in federal grants for the 2025 fiscal year.  Moore Decl. ¶ 7.  \nR\n19 Between July 28, 2025, and July 30, 2025 the airport received seven grant agreements from the FAA.  Id. \n20 ¶ 9.

See \n26 Dkt. 24-2.  Pursuant to this Court’s TRO, Defendants are enjoined from “failing or refusing to process \nand otherwise implement grants signed with changes or other objections to conditions enjoined by this \n27 Order.”  Plaintiffs are presently working with Defendants to implement the TRO and finalize execution \nof these agreements.  However, as of this filing, those agreements have not been executed, and it is \n28 unclear whether they will remain operative absent further injunctive relief. \n-12- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 27 of 56\n1 “HHS Plaintiffs”), receive, directly or indirectly, grant funds administered by HHS.  For example, the \n2 County of Sacramento receives tens of millions of dollars annually in HHS support, including funding \n3 from HRSA, Ryan White Part A and B, multiple CDC programs, and SAMHSA grants.  Lutz Decl. ¶ 8.  \n4 The County of Marin likewise depends on HHS grants, including Aging Cluster grants, Ryan White \n5 funds, CDC and DHCS public health funding, SAMHSA Adult Drug grants, and significant Title IV-E \n6 and Adoption Assistance funds administered through the Administration for Children and Families.  \n7 Warhuus Decl. ¶ 6.  These grant funds, along with the others detailed in Plaintiffs’ supporting \n8 declarations, are subject to the unlawful HHS Grant Conditions discussed above.  \n9 Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Redwood City, and the City of Alameda (collectively, the “EPA \n10 Plaintiffs”), receive, directly or indirectly, grant funds administered by EPA.  For example, Fresno has \n11 been awarded approximately $2.25 million in grants from the EPA, including a Brownfields Revolving \n12 Loan Fund (RFL) grant totaling $1,750,000 and a Brownfields Assessment grant in the amount of \n13 $500,000.  Clark Decl. ¶ 9.  The City of Alameda has a pending application before the EPA for a $2.5 \n14 million Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant.  Ott Decl. ¶ 5.  These grant funds, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 along with the others detailed in Plaintiffs’ supporting declarations, are subject to the unlawful EPA \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Grant Conditions discussed above.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Without injunctive relief, Plaintiffs will be forced to either forgo hundreds of millions of dollars \nN\nN\nE 18 in federal funds or attempt to comply with unlawful conditions that are impermissibly vague and directly \nR\n19 conflict with the grant programs’ authorizing statutes.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs bring this motion seeking \n20 injunctive relief to prevent irreparable harm to themselves and their residents. \n21 III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n22 “To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish (1) a likelihood of success on the \n23 merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of \n24 equities favors the plaintiff, and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.” Geo Group, Inc. v. \n25 Newsom, 50 F.4th 745, 753 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \n26 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  Where “the party opposing injunctive relief is a government entity, the third and \n27 fourth factors—the balance of equities and the public interest—’merge.’”  Fellowship of Christian \n28 Athletes v. San Jose Unified Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 82 F.4th 664, 695 (9th Cir. 2023).   \n-13- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 28 of 56\nIV.  ARGUMENT  \n1\nA.  Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Unlawful Grant Conditions \n2\n“A proper case or controversy exists only when at least one plaintiff establishes that she has \n3\nstanding to sue.”  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57 (2024) (quotations and alterations omitted).  “A \n4\n‘loss of funds promised under federal law[ ] satisfies Article III’s standing requirement.’” City & Cnty. of \n5\nSan Francisco v. Trump (“San Francisco I”), 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Organized Vill. \n6\nof Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 965 (9th Cir. 2015)).  “It [is] enough that, if the plaintiffs’ \n7\ninterpretation [of the law is] correct, the plaintiffs [] face serious repercussions in the absence of \n8\nsignificant and costly compliance measures.”  Id. at 1236 (cleaned up) (citing Virginia v. Am. Booksellers \n9\nAss’n, 484 U.S. 383, 392 (1988)).      \n10\nHere, Plaintiffs receive federal funding through grants administered by Defendants.  Defendants \n11\nhave imposed unlawful conditions described above that force Plaintiffs to choose between agreeing to \n12\nvague and unlawful conditions at the risk of incurring financial penalties, or giving up funds they were \n13\nalready awarded and, in many cases, accounted for in budget and project planning.  Loss of those funds \n14\n P\nU would result in immediate, irreparable, and reverberating harm to Plaintiffs.  These facts establish \nO\nGRw  15\nW La Plaintiffs’ standing to challenge the unlawful grant conditions.  See San Francisco I, 897 F.3d at 1236 \nLLIC Aeys at  16 (“the Counties have demonstrated that, if their interpretation of the Executive Order is correct, they will \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN be forced to either change their policies or suffer serious consequences”).  And, as this Court recognized \nN\nE 18\nR\nbefore granting the temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs face a genuine threat that the Defendants will \n19\nenforce the unlawful grant conditions in the absence of further injunctive relief once the restraining order \n20\nexpires.  See Dkt. 28 at 6–7 (citing San Francisco I, 879 F.3d at 1236).   \n21\nB.  This Court Has the Power to Review the Lawfulness of Defendants’ Grant Condi-\n22 tions \n23 1.  This Court Can Enjoin the DOT and the FAA from Imposing the Unlawful \nGrant Conditions \n24\nDefendants have asserted that this Court lacks jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. § 46110 “[t]o the \n25\nextent Plaintiffs challenge DOT and FAA orders here.”  Dkt. 24 at 16.  Not so.  Section 46110 specifies \n26\nthat the courts of appeal have exclusive jurisdiction for challenges to an “order issued” by the Secretary \n27\nof Transportation or the FAA Administrator “with respect to aviation duties and powers designated to be \n28\n-14- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 29 of 56\n1 carried out by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration … in whole or in part under this \n2 part, part B, or subsection (l) or (r) of section 114.”  49 U.S.C. § 46110(a) (emphasis added).   \n3 Indeed, the only decision that Plaintiffs are aware of involving the unlawful grant conditions \n4 rejected Defendants’ argument that 49 U.S.C. § 46110 forecloses jurisdiction over the claims involving \n5 the FAA.  See California v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1711531, at *1 (D.R.I. \n6 June 19, 2025).  As that court explained, this “jurisdictional statute[] [does] not apply here because the \n7 U.S. DOT is not exercising its authority ‘under’ the specific statutes listed in these jurisdictional \n8 provisions.  Rather, it is the Duffy Directive issued by the U.S. DOT that the States challenge, and thus \n9 jurisdiction is proper in the district court.”  Id. at *1; see National Ass’n of Mfrs. v. Dep’t of Defense, 583 \n10 U.S. 109, 124 (2018) (“the prepositional phrase—’under section 1311’—is most naturally read to mean \n11 that the effluent limitation or other limitation must be approved or promulgated ‘pursuant to’ or ‘by \n12 reason of authority of’ § 1311”). \n13 Further, under a well-established “exception[]” to section 46110, “[c]laims remain in district \n14 court if they [] involve agencies not covered by § 46110.”  Magassa v. Mayorkas, 52 F.4th 1156, 1165 \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 (9th Cir. 2022); see, e.g., Latif v. Holder, 686 F.3d 1122, 1128-29 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Plaintiffs’ procedural \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 challenge requires judicial review of orders issued both by TSA, which is named in § 46110, and by \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 TSC, which is not.”).  For claims challenging the DOT’s overarching policies, “jurisdiction rests with the \nN\nN\nE 18 district court,” in contrast to the cases Defendants cite (see Dkt. 24 at 16:8-12), which “tended to involve \nR\n19 relatively simple rules issued by a single [sub-]agency.”  Loan Syndications & Trading Ass’n v. S.E.C., \n20 818 F.3d 716, 722 (D.C. Cir. 2016); see also City of Los Angeles v. F.A.A., 2239 F.3d 1033, 1036-37 (9th \n21 Cir. 2001).  Because Plaintiffs’ claims involve various agencies not covered by section 46110 and \n22 challenge EOs and agency guidance not issued under the relevant statutes, this Court has jurisdiction. \n23 2.  The Tucker Act Does Not Preclude This Court’s Review. \n24 As this Court has previously recognized, Plaintiffs’ claims do not enforce contractual rights and \n25 do not seek an order mandating payment by the government.  Instead, they seek an order holding the \n26 action unlawful and setting it aside.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); Nat’l Institutes of Health v. Am. Pub. Health \n27 Ass’n, 606 U.S. ---, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2 (U.S. Aug. 21, 2025) (Barrett, J., concurring in the partial \n28 grant of the application for stay) (“[T]he District Court was likely correct to conclude that it had \n-15- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 30 of 56\n1 jurisdiction to entertain an APA challenge to the [internal agency] guidance, and it would be confusing \n2 for our disposition of this application to suggest that the CFC [Court of Federal Claims] is the right \n3 forum for that claim”).  Plaintiffs’ claims “aris[e] under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United \n4 States,” 28 U.S.C. § 1331, are subject to the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, 5 U.S.C. § 702, and \n5 thus are squarely within this Court’s jurisdiction.  Nothing in the Tucker Act deprives this Court of \n6 jurisdiction to grant the declaratory and injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek. \n7 The Tucker Act confers jurisdiction on the CFC and waives federal sovereign immunity for \n8 damages claims “founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United States” or upon \n9 certain constitutional or statutory provisions that mandate the payment of money.  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a). \n10 Defendants do not contend that Plaintiffs’ constitutional or statutory claims establish the type of “money-\n11 mandating” obligation to which the Tucker Act applies.  See Maine Cmty. Health Options v. United \n12 States, 590 U.S. 296, 322 (2020) (citation omitted).  Instead, they assert Plaintiffs’ claims are essentially \n13 contract claims seeking money damages.  Dkt. 24 at 16-18.  But this suit is not “‘at its essence’ a contract \n14 action.”  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  Claims involving “rights and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 remedies” that “are statutorily or constitutionally based” are not subject to the Tucker Act.  United \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Aeronautical Corp. v. U.S. Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 2023) (cleaned up). \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 As courts have held in similar cases, constitutional and APA claims seeking declaratory and \nN\nN\nE 18 injunctive relief from unlawful grant conditions are properly subject to the jurisdiction of the district \nR\n19 courts.  See, e.g., San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. v. AmeriCorps, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL \n20 1180729, at *6–11 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 23, 2025) (Tucker Act did not deprive court of jurisdiction to enter a \n21 TRO enjoining defendants from imposing and enforcing new conditions on plaintiff’s AmeriCorps \n22 grants); Martin Luther King, Jr. Cnty. v. Turner, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1582368, at *12 (W.D. \n23 Wash. June 3, 2025) (similar conclusion regarding HUD and DOT grant conditions); City & Cnty. of San \n24 Francisco v. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1282637, at *37 n.12 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2025); \n25 President and Fellows of Harvard College v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., --- F. Supp. 3d ----, \n26 2025 WL 2528380, at *14 (D. Mass. Sept. 3, 2025) (exercising jurisdiction as to plaintiffs’ First \n27 Amendment and Title VI challenges to freeze orders and termination letters, as well as plaintiffs’ APA \n28 challenges to the freeze orders, but not the termination letters). \n-16- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 31 of 56\n1 Defendants primarily rely on the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in Department of Education v. \n2 California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) (per curiam), and NIH, 606 U.S. ---, 2025 WL 2415669 (per curiam).  \n3 But those cases are distinguishable and in fact support Plaintiffs’ position.  In California, the Supreme \n4 Court stayed an order enjoining the defendants “from terminating any individual . . . grant for recipients \n5 in Plaintiff States, except to the extent the final agency action is consistent with . . . the grant terms and \n6 conditions,” California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. CV 25-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 760825, at *5 (D. Mass. \n7 Mar. 10, 2025) (emphasis added).  Thus, the Supreme Court construed the injunction as effectively an \n8 order “‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money.’”  Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto \n9 v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, 137 F.4th 932, 939 (9th Cir. 2025) (quoting \n10 California, 145 S. Ct. at 968).   \n11 In NIH, the Supreme Court granted the Government’s application to stay “as to the District \n12 Court’s judgments vacating the Government’s termination of various research-related grants” since the \n13 APA’s “‘limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity’ does not provide the District Court with jurisdiction to \n14 adjudicate claims ‘based on’ the research-related grants or to order relief designed to enforce any \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 ‘obligation to pay money’ pursuant to those grants.”  NIH, 606 U.S. ---, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1.  But it \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 “otherwise denied” a stay of the judgments insofar as they vacated internal agency guidance.  Id. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from newly attaching unlawful conditions \nN\nN\nE 18 to grant agreements, not from enforcing the terms of existing grant agreements.  Dkt. 28 at 5 & n.1.  \nR\n19 Indeed, Justice Barrett’s concurrence is instructive as to this distinction, particularly when viewed along \n20 with Chief Justice Roberts’ concurrence (which was joined by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson).  \n21 See NIH, 2025 WL 2415669, at *3 (Barrett, J., concurring) (“my preliminary judgment is that the \n22 plaintiffs’ challenges to the grant terminations belong in the CFC, and their APA challenges to the \n23 guidance belong in district court”); id. at *3 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part) (explaining that “the \n24 District Court’s vacatur of the challenged directives distinguishes this case from Department of Ed. v. \n25 California,” “has prospective and generally applicable implications beyond the reinstatement of specific \n26 grants,” and “falls well within the scope of the District Court’s jurisdiction under the Administrative \n27 Procedure Act”); cf. id. at *5 n.2 (Gorsuch, J., concurring and dissenting in part) (noting that the \n28 plaintiffs “also asserted injuries from the guidance based on the government’s alleged failure to process \n-17- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 32 of 56\n1 new grant applications” but that those allegations could not form a basis for the judgments vacating \n2 internal agency guidance because “the district court declined to pass on those allegations”). \n3 C.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \n4 1.  The Federal Grant Conditions Violate the U.S. Constitution \n5 Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating that the HUD Conditions, DOT Conditions, HHS \n6 Conditions, and EPA Conditions (collectively the Federal Grant Conditions) violate the Constitution.  \n7 a.  Plaintiffs’ non-APA claims for equitable relief are independently \n3\nactionable.  \n8\n“The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the creation of \n9\ncourts of equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to \n10\nEngland.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015); see also Corr. Servs. \n11\nCorp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001) (“injunctive relief has long been recognized as the proper \n12\nmeans for preventing entities from acting unconstitutionally”).   \n13\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, courts have regularly entertained constitutional claims seeking \n14\n P\nU prospective equitable relief against federal officials.  See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \nO\nGRw  15\nW La 343 U.S. 579, 589 (1952) (entertaining action against Secretary of Commerce based on President’s order \nLLIC Aeys at  16 directing Secretary to take possession of and operate most of the Nation’s steel mills and concluding that \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN the “seizure order cannot stand”); Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 \nN\nE 18\nR\nU.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010) (entertaining action against Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and \n19\nits members; noting that “equitable relief ‘has long been recognized as the proper means for preventing \n20\nentities from acting unconstitutionally” and “[i]f the Government’s point is that an Appointments Clause \n21\nor separation-of-powers claim should be treated differently than every other constitutional claim, it offers \n22\nno reason and cites no authority why that might be so”); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 263 n.1 (2021) \n23\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (“I assume the shareholders have brought such a cause of action here and have a \n24\nlegal right to obtain equitable relief if they can show they suffered an injury traceable to a Government \n25\naction that violates the Constitution.”); cf. United States v. McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1172 (9th Cir. \n26\n27  \n3 This Court directed the parties to “address in their preliminary injunction briefing whether the private \n28 right of action arises for the non-APA claims.”  Dkt. 28 at 9 n.3.   \n-18- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 33 of 56\n1 2016) (“When Congress has enacted a legislative restriction like § 542 that expressly prohibits DOJ from \n2 spending funds on certain actions, federal criminal defendants may seek to enjoin the expenditure of \n3 those funds”). \n4 To be sure, Congress may limit a court’s equitable power to enjoin acts violating federal law.  See \n5 Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327-28.  But courts “begin with the strong presumption that Congress intends \n6 judicial review of administrative action” and require “a showing of ‘clear and convincing evidence’ of a \n7 contrary legislative intent” to “restrict access to judicial review.”  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 670-71; see also \n8 Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 328-29 (finding intent to foreclose equitable relief for violations of the Medicaid \n9 Act).  And here, as the Ninth Circuit has explained, the 1976 amendment to 5 U.S.C. “§ 702 enacted a \n10 broad unqualified waiver for all non-monetary claims for relief against federal agencies,” including non-\n11 APA claims.  Navajo Nation v. Dep’t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, 1171 (9th Cir. 2017) (“the text of \n12 the second sentence of § 702 contains no limitation to ‘final agency action,’ to APA cases, or to APA and \n13 constitutional cases”); see also The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United States, 870 F.2d 518, 525 \n14 (9th Cir. 1989); accord United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 227 & n.32 (1983) (noting that in 1976 \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Congress “enacted a general consent” to suits for “declaratory, injunctive or mandamus relief against the \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Secretary”).  As explained above, because this case involves unlawful conditions for future grants and \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 not grant terminations, it is not a situation where another “statute that grants consent to suit expressly or \nN\nN\nE 18 impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”  5 U.S.C. § 702. \nR\n19 What’s more, even “[i]n the absence of a statutory waiver, the Supreme Court has permitted \n20 judicial review of presidential [or executive branch] actions in two circumstances.”  Murphy Co. v. \n21 Biden, 65 F.4th 1122, 1128 (9th Cir. 2023); see also E.V. v. Robinson, 906 F.3d 1082, 1090 (9th Cir. \n22 2018) (“[A] suit against a federal official for specific relief is not considered to be against the \n23 government, and thus not barred by sovereign immunity, where the plaintiff alleges:  (1) action by \n24 officers beyond their statutory powers or (2) even though within the scope of their authority, the powers \n25 themselves or the manner in which they are exercised are constitutionally void.” (cleaned up)).   \n26 “First, the Court has recognized constitutional challenges to presidential” and subordinate \n27 executive actions are “reviewable.”  Murphy, 65 F.4th at 1128 (citing Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 \n28 U.S. 788, 790-91 (1992)); see also Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 691 \n-19- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 34 of 56\n1 (1949) (recognizing exception when plaintiff contends that federal officials “were acting \n2 unconstitutionally or pursuant to an unconstitutional grant of power”); E.V., 906 F.3d at 1090 (“E.V.’s \n3 two constitutional claims are not ‘against the government’ for purposes of sovereign immunity” (citing \n4 Larson, 337 U.S. at 689-90)); Pollack v. Hogan, 703 F.3d 117, 120 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (constitutional right-\n5 to-travel claim against federal officials not barred because it is “well-established that sovereign immunity \n6 does not bar suits for specific relief against government officials where the challenged actions of the \n7 officials are alleged to be unconstitutional or beyond statutory authority” (cleaned up)); Strickland v. \n8 United States, 32 F.4th 311, 365 (4th Cir. 2022) (reaching similar conclusion with respect to Fifth \n9 Amendment claims).   \n10 Of course, not “every action by the President, or by another executive official, in excess of his \n11 statutory authority is ipso facto in violation of the Constitution.”  Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 472 \n12 (1994).  But “[w]hile ‘an action taken by the President in excess of his statutory authority [does not] \n13 necessarily violate[] the Constitution,’ specific allegations regarding separation of powers may suffice.”  \n14 Murphy Co., 65 F.4th at 1130 (quoting and altering Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473).  Thus, in Murphy, which \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 involved a claim that President Obama had violated the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Wagon Road Grant Lands Act when he issued a proclamation under the Antiquities Act expanding the \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument—the Ninth Circuit concluded that “the core of Murphy’s claim—\nN\nN\nE 18 that the President violated separation of powers by directing the Secretary to act in contravention of a \nR\n19 duly enacted law—could be considered constitutional and therefore reviewable.”  Id. \n20 “Second, the Court has held that actions by subordinate Executive Branch officials that extend \n21 beyond delegated statutory authority—i.e., ultra vires actions—are reviewable.”  Murphy, 65 F.4th at \n22 1129 (citing Larson, 337 U.S. at 689-90).  Put another way, “sovereign immunity does not shield an \n23 executive officer from suit for actions in ‘conflict with the terms of his valid statutory authority.’”  Id. \n24 (quoting Larson, 337 U.S. at 695).  This ultra vires exception “applies only when an agency has taken \n25 action entirely in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in a statute.”  \n26 Nuclear Regul. Comm’n v. Texas, 605 U.S. 665, 681 (2025).  Here, Plaintiffs’ non-APA claims are \n27 independently viable under the foregoing principles.  Section 702 effects a broad waiver of sovereign \n28 immunity for actions seeking equitable relief against unconstitutional or ultra vires actions.  Even if \n-20- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 35 of 56\n1 section 702’s statutory waiver of immunity did not apply, Plaintiffs could maintain their non-APA claims \n2 under the exceptions articulated in Murphy, Larson, and E.V. \n3 b.  The Federal Grant Conditions are unconstitutionally vague. \n4 Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating that the Federal Grant Conditions violate the \n5 Fifth Amendment’s vagueness doctrine by imposing opaque prohibitions that leave Plaintiffs without fair \n6 notice of their legal obligations and confer unbridled enforcement discretion on Defendants.  A \n7 government-imposed requirement is unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth Amendment if it either \n8 (1) fails to provide a “person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is \n9 prohibited” or (2) fails to “provide explicit standards for those who apply” the requirement, thereby \n10 encouraging “arbitrary and discriminatory application.”  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, \n11 108–09 (1972).  The Federal Grant Conditions fail on both counts.   \n12 Additionally, under the Spending Clause, “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant \n13 of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. \n14 1, 17 (1981) (emphasis added).  When determining the ambiguity of conditions on federal grants, the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Court evaluates “whether [a recipient]…would clearly understand…the obligations of the [conditions].”  \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).   \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Here, the vague and ambiguous Federal Grant Conditions leave Plaintiffs guessing whether \nN\nN\nE 18 previously permissible activities—such as hosting community workshops, providing space for local \nR\n19 affinity groups’ programs and events, or even just using words like “diversity” or “equity”—violate the \n20 Federal Grant Conditions.  This uncertainty not only forces Plaintiffs to self-censor but also implicates \n21 their constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty and property without due process of law, \n22 particularly in light of the exposure to potentially severe penalties under the False Claims Act. \ni.  The EO Conditions \n23\nDefendants have imposed various EO Conditions that ambiguously incorporate the President’s \n24\nEOs and require recipients to “comply” with them.  Some of the EO Conditions provide a “non-\n25\nexhaustive list” of specific EOs, such as the HUD EO Condition and the DOT EO Condition, while \n26\nothers simply refer to “all current Executive Orders” generally, such as the CoC EO Condition.  \n27\nHowever, none of the EOs at issue directly impose requirements on grant recipients; rather, they direct \n28\n-21- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 36 of 56\n1 the heads of executive agencies to impose conditions on federal funding.  Accordingly, it is nonsensical \n2 to require Plaintiffs to “comply” with the EOs, and unclear what requirements they impose on Plaintiffs.   \n3 This uncertainty renders the EO Conditions unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous under both \n4 the Due Process Clause and the Spending Clause.  First, due process requires that laws and conditions on \n5 federal funding be set forth with sufficient clarity to give ordinary recipients fair notice of what is \n6 required or prohibited.  See Cnty of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 534 (N.D. Cal. 2017) \n7 (citing Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108–09); San Francisco AIDS Foundation v. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, \n8 2025 WL 1621636, at *20 (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2025).  A condition that simply directs compliance with \n9 “all current Executive Orders” provides no meaningful guidance as to what conduct is expected, \n10 tolerated, or prohibited.  Executive orders vary in scope and subject matter, are subject to change at any \n11 time, and are addressed exclusively to executive branch actors.  A local government recipient is left to \n12 guess whether, and how, a particular EO applies to its conduct and risks loss of critical federal funding \n13 and FCA liability if it guesses incorrectly.  \n14 Second, the EO Conditions invite arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  By incorporating \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 executive orders in sweeping, undefined terms, the Conditions vest federal officials with unfettered \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 discretion to determine whether a recipient is “in compliance” without reference to any objective \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 standards.  This discretion enables the administration to wield grant funding as a tool of coercion, \nN\nN\nE 18 selectively enforcing vague obligations against disfavored recipients while overlooking the same conduct \nR\n19 by others.  The ambiguity of the EO Conditions thus makes them ripe for use as a mechanism of \n20 retaliation against entities that express viewpoints or pursue policies disfavored by the current \n21 administration.  The absence of clear guidelines transforms the grant process into a tool of political \n22 leverage, where recipients must conform to shifting executive priorities or risk losing essential funding. \n23 Third, the Spending Clause requires that conditions attached to federal funds be stated \n24 “unambiguously” so that state and local governments may exercise their choice knowingly and \n25 voluntarily.  See Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17; SFUSD, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 1713360, at *18.  The \n26 EO Conditions fail this standard.  Plaintiffs cannot knowingly agree to comply with “all current \n27 Executive Orders” because that phrase does not inform them of what specific obligations they are \n28 undertaking, much less what obligations might be imposed in the future.  The “non-exhaustive list” \n-22- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 37 of 56\n1 approach fares no better, since it signals that additional, unspecified EOs may be enforced against \n2 recipients at the government’s discretion.  A condition that operates as a moving target—changing with \n3 each new Executive Order—cannot satisfy the Spending Clause’s prohibition of ambiguous conditions. \nii.  DEI and Discrimination Conditions  \n4\nThe DEI Conditions suffer from many of the same infirmities as the EO Conditions.  Although \n5\nthe various DEI Conditions differ slightly, they all essentially require recipients to certify that they \n6\n“[w]ill not use Federal funding to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) mandates, policies, \n7\nprograms, or activities that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.”  See RJN, Ex. C at 1.  \n8\nOn its face, this provision appears redundant because recipients are already required to comply with all \n9\napplicable federal anti-discrimination laws.  The additional prohibition on using funds to “promote DEI” \n10\ninitiatives, however, introduces a new and undefined condition.  None of the Defendants in the various \n11\npolicies or agreements define the terms “diversity,” “equity,” or “inclusion,” nor do they explain what it \n12\nmeans for a program to “promote” DEI.  It is unclear whether routine housing equity programs, cultural \n13\ncompetency and implicit bias training, or public health programs aimed at reducing racial disparities in \n14\n P\nU\nGROw  15 health outcomes may be seen as “promoting DEI” and result in the loss of funding or FCA liability.  \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Such vagueness not only undermines the ability of grantees to comply with the terms and conditions of \nPE UBAttorn 17 their grant agreements but also creates a substantial risk of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.   \nN\nN Several courts have recently held that analogous anti-DEI and anti-equity conditions related to \nE 18\nR\nPresident Trump’s EOs are likely impermissibly vague.  See San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. v. \n19\nAmeriCorps, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2025 WL 1713360, at *22 (N.D. Cal. June 18, 2025); San Francisco \n20\nA.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2025 WL 1621636 at *21 (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2025); Nat’l \n21\nAss’n of Diversity Officers in Higher Educ. v. Trump, 767 F. Supp. 3d 243, 279–80 (D. Md.), opinion \n22\nclarified, 769 F. Supp. 3d 465 (D. Md. 2025); Nat’l Educ. Ass’n v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 779 F. \n23\nSupp. 3d 149, 188–89 (D.N.H. 2025); Nat’l Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. U.S. Dep’t of \n24\nEduc., 779 F. Supp. 3d 53, 66–67 (D.D.C. 2025). \n25\nDefendants’ recent revisions to some of the DEI Conditions do not cure these constitutional \n26\ndefects.  For example, the revised EPA Discrimination Condition requires recipients to certify that they \n27\ndo “not operate any programs violating any applicable Federal antidiscrimination law or promoting any \n28\n-23- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 38 of 56\n1 such violation.”  RJN, Ex. Z at 44.  This language remains impermissibly vague.  It fails to specify what \n2 constitutes “applicable Federal antidiscrimination law,” leaving recipients uncertain whether that phrase \n3 refers solely to duly enacted statutes such as Title VI and Title VII, or whether Defendants broadly \n4 interpret the language to incorporate Executive Orders and agency directives.  The condition also \n5 introduces the undefined concept of “promoting” a violation of the law.  It is unclear what it means for a \n6 program that itself complies with antidiscrimination law to nonetheless be deemed to “promote” a \n7 violation.  Such phrasing leaves recipients to speculate whether ordinary activities—such as public \n8 statements or campaigns affirming DEI principles, employee resource groups or affinity networks, or \n9 inclusive curriculum or educational programming—might be construed as violations.  By replacing \n10 explicit references to “DEI” with equally indeterminate prohibitions, the revised Discrimination \n11 Conditions perpetuate the same vagueness problems, depriving grantees of clear notice and enabling \n12 arbitrary enforcement. \niii.  Gender Ideology Conditions \n13\nThe Gender Ideology Conditions imposed across HUD, CoC, HHS, and HRSA grants are \n14\n P\nU\nGROw  15 unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous because they fail to provide clear, enforceable standards, \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 thereby inviting arbitrary enforcement.  Although EO 14168 contains a definition of “gender ideology,” \nPE UBAttorn 17 that definition is itself sweeping, subjective, and infused with ideological judgments.  Terms such as \nN\nN “ever-shifting,” “false claim,” and “vast spectrum” provide no objective criteria for determining when a \nE 18\nR\nrecipient’s conduct “promotes” gender ideology.  A grantee cannot reasonably discern whether inclusive \n19\nnondiscrimination policies, recognition of transgender individuals, provision of gender-affirming care, or \n20\neven simply using the term “genders” constitutes a violation.  This lack of clarity leaves recipients \n21\nguessing at the scope of their obligations under threat of severe funding consequences and FCA liability.  \n22\nSuch open-ended and ideologically charged conditions cannot satisfy constitutional requirements. \n23\niv.  Elective Abortion Conditions \n24\nThe HUD and CoC Elective Abortion Conditions are also unconstitutionally vague under the Due \n25\nProcess Clause and ambiguous under the Spending Clause.  While the Conditions reference EO 14182, \n26\nneither the EO nor the grant terms define what constitutes an “elective” abortion or what it means to \n27\n“promote” one.  It is unclear whether “promotion” encompasses counseling, referrals, provision of \n28\n-24- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 39 of 56\n1 information, or advocacy by subgrantees, or whether “elective” excludes procedures performed for \n2 health, fetal anomaly, or other non-life-threatening medical reasons.  Such indeterminate and malleable \n3 terms do not put grantees on notice and invite selective enforcement. \nv.  Immigration Enforcement Conditions \n4\nSimilarly, the HUD and DOT Immigration Enforcement Conditions are unconstitutionally vague \n5\nand ambiguous.  The HUD Condition prohibits the use of funds in a manner that “facilitates the \n6\nsubsidization or promotion of illegal immigration” or “abets policies that seek to shield illegal aliens \n7\nfrom deportation,” but offers no definition of what constitutes “facilitates,” “subsidization,” or \n8\n“promotion.”  See RJN, Ex. A at 2.  Likewise, the DOT Condition requires recipients to “cooperate with \n9\nFederal officials” and refrain from “impeding” immigration enforcement, yet does not define “cooperate” \n10\nor “impeding.”  See Bacher Decl., Ex. 8; RJN Ex. E at 25, . \n11\nThese open-ended terms leave recipients without fair notice of what conduct is prohibited.  It is \n12\nunclear, for example, whether providing housing assistance to mixed-status families, adopting \n13\nconfidentiality policies to encourage crime reporting, or limiting local law enforcement’s role in federal \n14\n P\nU\nGROw  15 immigration enforcement constitutes a violation.  The ambiguity of these terms forces recipients to guess \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 at their obligations while allowing federal officials to decide after the fact what conduct is prohibited. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 c.  The Federal Grant Conditions violate the Separation of Powers. \nN\nN The Constitution “exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.”  San \nE 18\nR\nFrancisco I, 897 F.3d at 1231.  Accordingly, there is no inherent executive authority to place conditions \n19\non the receipt of federal funds—any such authority must be given to the executive by the legislature.  See \n20\nCity of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931, 945 (9th Cir. 2019) (agency grant conditions imposed without \n21\nstatutory authority were “ultra vires”).  Absent an express delegation of congressional authority, the \n22\nPresident’s power to impose conditions on grants “is at its lowest ebb.”  San Francisco I, 897 F.3d at \n23\n1233 (cleaned up).  Similarly, “unless and until Congress confers power on” them, agencies have \n24\n“literally . . . no power to act . . . .”  Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  \n25\nHere, no statute gives Defendants the power to impose conditions on federal grants remotely \n26\napproaching those at issue.  The various DEI and Discrimination Conditions attempt to prohibit the use \n27\nof funds for undefined categories of “DEI mandates” or “equity ideology” even though Congress has \n28\n-25- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 40 of 56\n1 never enacted legislation barring grantees from supporting such initiatives.  See San Francisco A.I.D.S. \n2 Found., 2025 WL 1621636, at *25. \n3 The HUD and CoC Gender Ideology Conditions, as well as the HHS GPS Gender Ideology \n4 Conditions, similarly attempt to bind recipients to the policy dictates of Executive Order 14168, yet \n5 Congress has never authorized the Executive to use Title IX or Title VI as vehicles for prohibiting \n6 “gender ideology.”  In fact, the Gender Ideology Conditions facially discriminate based on transgender \n7 status, violating the Separation of Powers by contravening antidiscrimination laws.  See San Francisco \n8 A.I.D.S. Found., 2025 WL 1621636, at *27. \n9 The HUD, CoC, and DOT Immigration Enforcement Conditions purport to require cooperation \n10 with federal immigration enforcement and prohibit policies that “facilitate” or “promote” “illegal \n11 immigration,” even though Congress has repeatedly declined to enact legislation cutting off federal funds \n12 for so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions.”  See San Francisco I, 897 F.3d at 1231 (holding that Executive \n13 Branch may not withhold federal grants from sanctuary cities without congressional authorization). \n14 The HUD and CoC Elective Abortion Conditions purport to “enforce” the Hyde Amendment, but \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 they go far beyond what that statute actually requires.  The Hyde Amendment, enacted as an annual \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 appropriations rider, prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 or where the life of the mother is at risk.  See Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 810, 138 Stat. 591 (2024).  In \nN\nN\nE 18 contrast, the Elective Abortion Conditions prohibit grantees from using federal funds to “fund or promote \nR\n19 elective abortions” in all contexts, extending the restriction beyond the prohibitions of the Hyde \n20 Amendment, imposing obligations on recipients not contemplated by Congress.  See also Martin Luther \n21 King, Jr. Cnty. v. Turner, No. 2:25-CV-814, 2025 WL 2322763 at *13 n.9 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 12, 2025) \n22 These Conditions effectively rewrite the terms of numerous longstanding grant programs without \n23 any statutory basis.  By converting funds appropriated by Congress into leverage for the Executive to \n24 pursue policy goals that Congress has either declined to enact into law or chosen to address differently, \n25 Defendants usurp Congress’s “power of the purse” and violate bedrock separation of powers principles.   \n26 d.  The Federal Grant Conditions are not germane. \n27 The Federal Grant Conditions are especially problematic because they exceed even Congress’ \n28 power to condition federal funds.  The Spending Clause only permits Congress to impose “reasonable \n-26- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 41 of 56\n1 conditions relevant to federal interest in the project and to the over-all objectives thereof.”  South Dakota \n2 v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987) (cleaned up).  Accordingly, any Federal Grant Conditions must have \n3 some “nexus” with the purpose of the grant funds at issue.  See Cnty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. \n4 Supp. 3d at 532.  The same nexus requirement applies to Executive Branch–imposed conditions.  Id.  \n5 There is no nexus whatsoever between the challenged Federal Grant Conditions and the federal interest \n6 in the grant funds at issue here.   \n7 The DEI-related condition prohibits recipients from using funds to “promote” diversity, equity, \n8 and inclusion mandates, policies, or programs.  However, HUD’s CPD and CoC programs are designed \n9 to fund affordable housing, prevent homelessness, provide community infrastructure, and deliver services \n10 to vulnerable populations—activities that frequently require outreach to historically underserved \n11 communities.  The DEI condition is untethered to these statutory purposes and invites enforcement based \n12 on ideological disagreement rather than project compliance.  Likewise, FTA’s fixed guideway capital \n13 investment, urbanized area formula, state-of-good-repair, and bus facility grants, which support \n14 infrastructure projects, vehicle purchases, and system maintenance, have no connection to limitations on \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 DEI.  The same is true for FHWA’s roadway safety, bridge repair, aquatic ecosystem restoration, \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 transportation technology programs, FAA’s airport improvement and infrastructure grants, and DOT \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 IFAC grants.  The DEI restriction bears no relationship to engineering, safety, environmental, transit \nN\nN\nE 18 development, or aviation objectives.  Similarly, the HHS grants, which are intended to support public \nR\n19 health programs and services, and the EPA grants, which are intended to fund environmental protection \n20 and remediation efforts, have no nexus to the DEI conditions. \n21 The Immigration Enforcement Conditions are equally unrelated to HUD and DOT grant \n22 programs.  The HUD programs have no statutory mandate to enforce immigration laws, and immigration \n23 policy has no bearing on community development, affordable housing, or homelessness.  The absence of \n24 any nexus is even more apparent with DOT, FTA, FHWA, and FAA grants, whose purposes are to \n25 construct, maintain, and improve transit, highway, and aviation systems.  As Cnty. of Santa Clara v. \n26 Trump held, immigration enforcement has no connection to programs focused on transportation, health, \n27 or housing.  See 250 F. Supp. 3d at 532.   \n28 The HUD and HHS Gender Ideology Conditions are also unrelated to the grants at issue.  HUD’s \n-27- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 42 of 56\n1 housing programs are tasked with meeting fair housing obligations, preventing homelessness, and \n2 addressing community needs; this ideological restriction has nothing to do with the provision of shelter \n3 or compliance with the Fair Housing Act.  Transportation and aviation programs are concerned with \n4 building and maintaining infrastructure, not regulating gender identity.  Similarly, the prohibition on \n5 using grant funds to fund or promote “elective abortions,” as set out in E.O. 14182, is entirely unrelated \n6 to the purposes of the federal grant programs at issue.  Across all programs, the Federal Grant Conditions \n7 are unconnected to the purposes of the federal programs and instead impose broad social policy \n8 restrictions divorced from the statutory objectives Congress enacted.  Their enforcement would exceed \n9 even Congress’s conditional spending authority, let alone the Executive’s.  \n10 e.  The Immigration Enforcement Condition violates the Tenth \nAmendment.   \n11\nThe Immigration Enforcement Condition also violates the Tenth Amendment because it imposes \n12\na coercive condition intended to commandeer local officials into enforcing federal immigration practices \n13\nand law.  The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from “commandeering” state and local \n14\n P\nU officials to help enforce federal law.  See Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997).  The Ninth Circuit \nO\nGRw  15\nW La has held that forcing state and local governments to assist with federal immigration enforcement would \nLLIC Aeys at  16 violate the Tenth Amendment.  United States v. California, 921 F.3d 865, 888–91 (9th Cir. 2019).  And \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN the federal government cannot do indirectly through coercive grant conditions what it could not do \nN\nE 18\nR\ndirectly.  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 578 (2012).  Yet that is exactly what \n19\nDefendants are doing—holding a gun to recipients’ heads to force them to use local resources to \n20\ncooperate with federal officials in enforcing immigration law.  See id. at 581.  Accordingly, just as the \n21\nImmigration Enforcement Condition is impermissibly coercive under the Spending Clause, it also \n22\nviolates the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering principles.  Religious Sisters of Mercy v. Azar, 513 \n23\nF. Supp. 3d 1113, 1151 (D.N.D. 2021) (“The Spending Clause’s coercion backstop is closely linked to \n24\nthe Tenth Amendment concept that the federal government may not commandeer the states to enact or \n25\nadminister a federal regulatory program” (cleaned up)). \n26\n27\n28\n-28- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 43 of 56\n2.  The Federal Grant Conditions Violate the APA \n1\na.  Defendants’ unlawful grant conditions are not committed to agency \n2 discretion by law. \n3 Defendants erroneously argue 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) precludes judicial review.  Dkt. 24 at 24-25.  \n4 Under that section, a court may not conduct APA review if the “agency action is committed to agency \n5 discretion by law.”  This “quite narrow[]” exception to the “basic presumption of judicial review” under \n6 the APA does not apply here.  Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 771, 772 (2019) (cleaned \n7 up); see also SFUSD, 2025 WL 1180729, at *3 (rejecting similar argument). \n8 First, an agency action “is committed to agency discretion by law” only “where a statute is drawn \n9 in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply, and the court would have no meaningful \n10 standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 592 \n11 (1988).  Only in those “rare instances” in which there is “truly no law to apply” is it appropriate to follow \n12 section 701(a)(2).  Jajati v. U.S. Customs & Border Prot., 102 F.4th 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2024).  Even \n13 when Congress intended to create a wide zone of agency discretion, the agency still must meet \n14 “permissible statutory objectives.”  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 193 (1993). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Defendants rely heavily on Lincoln, 508 U.S. 182, and Amica Ctr. for Immigrant Rights v. U.S. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Dep’t of Justice, 2025 WL 1852762 (D.D.C. July 6, 2025).  Dkt. 24 at 25.  But Lincoln involved a \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 “‘lump sum appropriation,’” which “‘reflects a congressional recognition that an agency must be allowed \nN\nN\nE 18 flexibility to shift funds within a particular appropriation account so that the agency can make necessary \nR\n19 adjustments for unforeseen developments and changing requirements.’”  SFUSD, 2025 WL 1180729, at \n20 *4 (quoting Lincoln).  Indeed, in Amica Ctr. for Immigrant Rights, two of the three cancelled programs \n21 “were discretionarily funded through EOIR’s lump sum appropriations.”  2025 WL 1852762 at *14.  As \n22 for the third program, “‘no statute or regulation even mention[ed]’” it, and it was also not specifically \n23 referenced in the relevant earmark or appropriations act.  2025 WL 1852762 at *14 (quoting Lincoln).   \n24 Here, in stark contrast, there is no indication that Congress, in authorizing the grant programs at \n25 issue, intended to commit Defendants’ imposition of grant conditions to agency discretion, thereby \n26 exempting such actions entirely from judicial review.  The grant programs are authorized and governed \n27 by statutes setting forth the purpose, selection criteria, recipient requirements, and grant conditions, \n28 among other things.  See, e.g., 23 U.S.C § 24112 (SS4A); 42 U.S.C. §§ 5303–5305 (CDBG); id. \n-29- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 44 of 56\n1 §§ 11372, 11374–11375 (ESG); id. §§ 12742, 12744, 12475, 12476 (HOME); id. §§ 12903(d)(1)–(6) \n2 (HOPWA); id. § 254b(HCP); id. § 9604(k) (Brownfields); 49 U.S. Code § 47106 (AIP). \n3 Defendants’ new conditions exceed their statutory authority under those provisions.  Because the \n4 statutes provide a basis for this Court to exercise judicial review, Defendants’ actions are not “committed \n5 to agency discretion by law” and thus section 701(a)(2) does not preclude Plaintiffs’ APA claim.  See \n6 King County, 2025 WL 1582368 at *12-13 (“each of these enabling statutes provides substantial \n7 guidance as to how the agencies’ discretion should be exercised in implementing these programs, and for \n8 the Court to evaluate whether that discretion is being exercised in a reasonable manner”); SFUSD, 2025 \n9 WL 1180729, at *3–5 (concluding similarly in APA challenge to AmeriCorps grant conditions); see also \n10 Bowen, 487 U.S. at 898 (noting legislative history indicates Congress understood APA would “authorize \n11 judicial review of the ‘administration of Federal grant-in-aid programs’”).4   \n12 b.  The federal agency actions at issue are “final agency action” \nreviewable under the APA. \n13\nCourts have regularly found that “the new funding conditions at issue here are ‘final agency \n14\n P\nU actions’ for purposes of APA review.”  King County, 2025 WL 1582368, at *14 n.18; Rhode Island \nO\nGRw  15\nW La Coalition Against Domestic Violence v. Bondi, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 2271867, at *6 (D.R.I. Aug. \nLLIC Aeys at  16 8, 2025) (“Accordingly, the Court sides with courts that have found that agency placement of new \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN conditions on grant funding amounts to final agency action”); San Francisco Unified School Dist., 2025 \nN\nE 18\nR\nWL 1713360, at *13-15 (concluding that AmeriCorps Directive stating that “All aspects of AmeriCorps \n19\ngrants/awards must comply with President Trump’s executive orders …” was final agency action under \n20\nthe APA).  Indeed, as this Court previously explained:  “The E.O. Grant Conditions are reviewable here \n21\nas final agency action:  they take definitive legal positions that the Executive Orders and Executive Grant \n22\n \n23 4 Even if Defendants’ actions were “discretionary,” section 701(a)(2) does not preclude judicial review of \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claims.  Absent clear congressional intent, section 701(a)(2) does not bar review \n24 of colorable constitutional claims arising from agency actions.  See Webster, 486 U.S. at 603 \n(“heightened showing” is required “in part to avoid the serious constitutional question that would arise if \n25 a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim” (cleaned \nup)); see also Nguyen v. Kissinger, 528 F.2d 1194, 1199 (9th Cir. 1975) (“nothing in the [APA] purports \n26 to sanction the violation of constitutional rights committed under the guise of the exercise of discretion”); \nWong v. Warden, FCI Raybrook, 171 F.3d 148, 149 (2d Cir. 1999) (“It is well-established that judicial \n27 review exists over allegations of constitutional violations even when the agency decisions underlying the \nallegations are discretionary”); SFUSD, 2025 WL 1180729, at *6 (section 701(a)(2) did not bar review of \n28 constitutional challenge to AmeriCorps directive imposing new grant conditions). \n-30- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 45 of 56\n1 Conditions are enforceable against Plaintiffs; this position poses an immediate and significant practical \n2 burden on Plaintiffs; and the disputed legal authority underlying the positions are fully fit for judicial \n3 review.”  Dkt. 28 at 5 (cleaned up). \n4 c.  The Federal Grant Conditions are in excess of statutory jurisdiction.  \n5 Under the APA, a court may set aside an agency action that is “contrary to constitutional right, \n6 power, privilege, or immunity” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \n7 statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B), (C).  As discussed above, the Federal Grant Conditions are \n8 unconstitutional in several respects.  See supra, IV(C)(1).  Accordingly, this Court may enjoin the \n9 imposition of the conditions under § 706(2)(B).  Furthermore, Defendants violate § 706(2)(C) because \n10 their promulgation of the Federal Grant Conditions does not derive from any statutory authority.  In fact, \n11 in several respects, the Federal Grant Conditions are contrary to statutory requirements.  \ni.  Congress has not authorized the HUD Grant Conditions. \n12\nCongress has established various grant programs administered by HUD through CPD.  Several of \n13\nthese programs are codified in title 42 of the U.S. Code and were created (or later reauthorized) by the \n14\n P\nU\nGROw  15 Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93 383, 88 Stat. 633; the Cranston Gonzalez \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101 625, 104 Stat. 4079; the Stewart B. McKinney \nPE UBAttorn 17 Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100 77, 101 Stat. 482, as amended by the HEARTH Act \nN\nN of 2009, Pub. L. 111 22, 123 Stat. 1663; and the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101 \nE 18\nR\n625.   42 U.S.C. §§ 5303–5304 (CDBG program), 11372 (ESG program), 12741 (HOME program), \n19\n12903 (HOPWA program).   \n20\nCongress has enumerated various certifications and requirements that CPD grant recipients must \n21\nadhere to as a condition of receiving funds.  Such certifications include that the recipient will develop \n22\nand follow a citizen participation plan, comply with statutory transparency requirements, ensure funds \n23\nare consistent with statutory objectives, and administer programs in conformity with nondiscrimination \n24\nlaws.  42 U.S.C. § 5304(a)(3), (b); see also id. §§ 11375(c), 11375(c).  None of these statutes authorize \n25\nHUD to condition CPD grant funding on prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \n26\nimmigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n27\nideology” or “elective abortion.”  \n28\n-31- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 46 of 56\n1 Far from barring diversity-related “inclusion,” Congress requires consideration of diversity when \n2 allocating HUD funds.  For instance, the HUD Secretary is required to set aside CDBG funds for \n3 “[s]pecial purpose grants,” including grants to “historically Black colleges.” 42 U.S.C. § 5307(b)(2); see \n4 also id. § 5307(c) (requiring CDBG funds be allocated to provide “assistance to economically \n5 disadvantaged and minority students”).  And in authorizing the HOME and HOPWA programs, Congress \n6 acted to “improve housing opportunities for all residents of the United States, particularly members of \n7 disadvantaged minorities, on a nondiscriminatory basis.”  Id. § 12702(3).  Congress also requires HOME \n8 recipients “to establish and oversee a minority outreach program...to ensure the inclusion, to the \n9 maximum extent possible, of minorities and women, and entities owned by minorities and women...in all \n10 contracts[ ] entered into by the participating jurisdiction.”  Id. § 12831(a). \n11 Moreover, Defendants’ ability to impose the challenged conditions on the CPD grants is further \n12 constrained by 42 U.S.C. § 12711, which prohibits HUD from “denying funds made available under \n13 [HUD] programs...based on the adoption, continuation, or discontinuation” of any lawful local policies.  \n14 Stated differently, “HUD may not … condition funding on changes to local policies.”  Cnty. of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 Westchester v. U.S. Dep’t of Housing and Urban Dev., 802 F.3d 413, 433 (2d Cir. 2015).   \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 HUD also administers the CoC grant program enacted by Congress pursuant to the McKinney-\nBn\nPE UAttor 17 Vento Homeless Assistance Act (the “Homeless Assistance Act”).  42 U.S.C. §§ 11301, 11381.  The \nN\nN\nE 18 Homeless Assistance Act directs the HUD Secretary to award CoC grants on a competitive basis using \nR\n19 statutorily prescribed selection criteria.  Id. §11382(a).  Section 427 of the Homeless Assistance Act, 42 \n20 U.S.C. § 11386a, provides for the HUD Secretary to establish selection criteria to evaluate grant \n21 applications and sets forth specific criteria the HUD Secretary must use.  These required criteria include \n22 factors such as the recipient’s previous performance in addressing homelessness, whether the recipient \n23 has demonstrated coordination with other public and private entities serving homeless individuals, and \n24 the need for homeless services within the geographic area.  Id. (b)(1)-(2).  Section 426 of the Homeless \n25 Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11386, sets forth “[r]equired agreements” to which grant recipients must \n26 adhere.  Recipients must agree to, among other things, “monitor and report to the [HUD] Secretary the \n27 progress of the project,” “take the educational needs of children into account when families are placed in \n28 emergency or transitional shelter,” “place families with children as close as possible to their school of \n-32- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 47 of 56\n1 origin,” and obtain various certifications from direct service providers.  Id. § 11386(b).  The Homeless \n2 Assistance Act does not establish any statutory requirements that: prohibit DEI initiatives, promoting \n3 “gender ideology” or “elective abortions”; mandate local participation in the enforcement of federal \n4 immigration laws; or authorize the President or the HUD Secretary to impose such conditions. \n5 Additionally, PRWORA does not authorize the CoC PRWORA Verification Condition.  \n6 PRWORA explicitly does not require states to have an immigration status verification system until \n7 twenty-four months after the Attorney General promulgates certain final regulations.  8 U.S.C. § 1642(b).  \n8 Those regulations must, among other things, establish procedures by which states and local governments \n9 may verify eligibility and procedures for applicants to prove citizenship “in a fair and nondiscriminatory \n10 manner.”  Id. § 1642(b)(ii), (iii).  The Attorney General has issued interim guidance and a proposed \n11 verification rule, but has not implemented a final rule.  See Interim Guidance on Verification of \n12 Citizenship, Qualified Alien Status and Eligibility Under Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and \n13 Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, 62 Fed. Reg. 61344 (Nov. 17, 1997); Verification of \n14 Eligibility for Public Benefits, 63 Fed. Reg. 41662 (Aug. 4, 1998) (proposed rule).  This failure to \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 promulgate a final regulation left in place DOJ’s Interim Guidance, which requires only the examination \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 of identity and immigration documentation.  62 Fed. Reg. 61348–49 (Nov. 17, 1997).  Absent \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 implementing regulations, Plaintiffs are not required to verify participants’ immigration status using \nN\nN\nE 18 SAVE or an equivalent verification system.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1320b-7.  Requiring recipients to do so \nR\n19 exceeds the authority created in PRWORA. \nii.  Congress has not authorized the DOT Grant Conditions. \n20\nThe purposes of each DOT grant program, including the conditions required for participation, are \n21\ndescribed in the programs’ authorizing statutes.  For example, for the IFAC grant program, codified in 23 \n22\nU.S.C. § 611, the statutory requirements relate to conducting, evaluating, publishing, and implementing \n23\nasset concessions and infrastructure development.  The statute does not restrict eligible entities’ DEI-\n24\nrelated activities or require them to support federal immigration enforcement.  \n25\nFor FTA programs codified in 49 U.S.C. ch. 53—including urbanized area formula grants \n26\n(§ 5307), fixed guideway capital investment grants (§ 5309), state-of-good-repair grants (§ 5337), and \n27\nbus and bus facility grants (§ 5339)—the statutory requirements relate to eligible transit purposes, \n28\n-33- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 48 of 56\n1 operational capacity, long-term asset maintenance, and project performance.  There are no statutory \n2 restrictions on DEI-related activities or mandates to facilitate immigration enforcement.  Congress \n3 annually appropriates funds for these programs and has never attached or authorized such conditions. \n4 FHWA grant programs likewise are created and governed by specific statutory authorizations, \n5 including the SS4A program (§ 24112 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”)), the \n6 Federal-Aid Highway Program (23 U.S.C. §§ 119, 133, 148, 149, 167, 175, 176), as well as specialized \n7 programs like the BIP program (23 U.S.C. § 124), the Culvert AOP Program (49 U.S.C. § 6703), and the \n8 ATTAIN program (23 U.S.C. § 503(c)(4)).  The statutory criteria for these programs address \n9 transportation safety, mobility, environmental performance, and infrastructure condition—not \n10 immigration enforcement or the prohibition of DEI.   \n11 FAA airport grant programs, including the AIP program and the AIG program under IIJA (49 \n12 U.S.C. §§ 47101 et seq.), also include statutorily defined conditions and assurances related to safety, \n13 capacity, environmental compliance, and nondiscriminatory public use.  See 49 U.S.C. § 47107.  The \n14 statutorily based conditions and assurances include requiring consistency with plans for development of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 the surrounding area, financial capacity, ability to complete the project “without unreasonable delay,” \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 and requiring sponsor to make certain written assurances based on the type of grant at issue, such as “the \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 airport will be available for public use on reasonable conditions and without unjust discrimination” and \nN\nN\nE 18 “the airport and facilities on or connected with the airport will be operated and maintained suitably, with \nR\n19 consideration given to climatic and flood conditions”.  49 U.S.C. §§ 47106, 47107.  No DEI, gender \n20 ideology, or immigration enforcement related conditions are included in the assurances authorized by \n21 statute.  Reauthorization acts, such as the FAA Reauthorization Acts of 2018 and 2024, likewise do not \n22 prohibit DEI or mandate immigration-enforcement cooperation. \n23 Furthermore, many FTA, FHWA, and FAA grant programs that provide federal financial \n24 assistance for airport, transit, or highway infrastructure projects require minority and disadvantaged \n25 business participation through the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) Program.  See, e.g., 23 \n26 U.S.C. § 177(e)(2); 49 U.S.C. § 47113.  The DBE Program is a Congressionally mandated program \n27 established by statutes and implemented through 49 C.F.R. Part 26.  The DBE Program requires \n28 recipients of federal aviation, highway, and transit funds to set participation goals for small businesses \n-34- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 49 of 56\n1 owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including minority- and \n2 women-owned firms. See 49 C.F.R. § 26.5 (establishing race and gender as criteria to be considered \n3 socially and economically disadvantaged).  The program’s purpose is to remedy the effects of \n4 discrimination in transportation contracting and ensure disadvantaged businesses have a fair opportunity \n5 to compete.  The President’s DEI and Gender Ideology EOs and related DOT Conditions seek to \n6 discourage or prohibit race- and gender-conscious contracting measures, directly undermining the \n7 statutory goals of the DBE Program. \n8 Across DOT and all relevant operating administrations—FTA, FHWA, and FAA—Congress has \n9 been precise in defining both the purposes for which federal transportation funds may be used and the \n10 conditions recipients must meet.  Those statutory conditions are comprehensive, specific, and limited to \n11 program-related requirements.   Where, as here, Congress has spoken and has not authorized the \n12 conditions now asserted through executive order, the Executive Branch lacks authority to impose them. \niii.  Congress has not authorized the HHS Grant Conditions. \n13\nThe HHS grant programs are established by Congress through statute.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 247c(b)–\n14\n P\nU\nGROw  15 (c) (High-Impact HIV Prevention and Surveillance Program), 254b (HCP program), 290dd et seq. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 (SAMHSA programs); 300ff et seq. (RWHA program).  These statutes provide specific eligibility and \nPE UBAttorn 17 criteria requirements.  For example, 42 U.S.C. § 247c establishes requirements for the High-Impact HIV \nN\nN Prevention and Surveillance Programs grant, including recordkeeping requirements and patient \nE 18\nR\nconfidentiality mandates.  42 U.S.C. §§ 247c(e)(3), (5).  There are no statutory requirements conditioning \n19\nthe availability of these grants that prohibit DEI initiatives or promoting “gender ideology.” \n20\nThe HHS Gender Ideology Conditions (the October HHS GPS Gender Ideology Condition and \n21\nthe HRSA Gender Ideology Condition) invoke Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 as a \n22\nsupposed statutory basis for the incorporation of EO 14168.  This contention is unsupportable because \n23\nthe Gender Ideology Conditions actually contravene Title IX.  EO 14168 mandates that “[f]ederal funds \n24\nshall not be used to promote gender ideology” and requires grant recipients to “recognize two sexes, male \n25\nand female” and that “[t]hese sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and \n26\nincontrovertible reality.”  But nothing in Title IX mandates such understandings.  To the contrary, courts \n27\nhave concluded that failure to recognize an individual’s transgender status constitutes discrimination \n28\n-35- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 50 of 56\n1 under Title IX.  See e.g., Roe v. Critchfield, 137 F.4th 912, 928 (9th Cir. 2025); Grimm v. Gloucester \n2 Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 616– 17 (4th Cir. 2020); A.C. by M.C. v. Metro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville, \n3 75 F.4th 760, 769 (7th Cir. 2023); see also Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644, 683 (2020) \n4 (recognizing transgender as a protected category under Title VII).  Contrary to enforcing Title IX, HHS’s \n5 Gender Ideology Conditions seek to graft contradictory requirements into the statute. \n6 Defendants’ HHS Conditions have no basis in statute, and their imposition on the grant programs \n7 at issue exceeds their statutory authority.   \niv.  Congress has not authorized the EPA Grant Conditions. \n8\nCongress authorized the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program through the Small \n9\nBusiness Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-118, 115 Stat. \n10\n2356 (2002).  The Act authorizes the EPA to award Brownfields assessment grants, cleanup grants, \n11\nrevolving loan fund (“RLF”) grants, and job training grants.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 9604(k)(2)–(6).  The RLF \n12\nprogram (§ 9604(k)(3)) allows eligible entities to establish loan funds for cleanup activities at brownfield \n13\nsites.  Congress has specified eligible activities and prohibited uses.  Funds may not pay penalties or \n14\n P\nU\nGROw  15 fines, satisfy federal cost-share requirements, cover cleanup at sites where the recipient is a potentially \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 responsible party under CERCLA § 107, or cover compliance costs under other federal environmental \nPE UBAttorn 17 laws except those associated with cleanup.  Id. § 9604(k)(5)(B).  Grant and loan agreements must require \nN\nN compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and a 20% non-federal match unless EPA waives it \nE 18\nR\nfor hardship.  Id. § 9604(k)(10)(B).   \n19\nThe Brownfields Revitalization Act does not prohibit consideration of diversity or equity.  To the \n20\ncontrary, statutory ranking criteria require consideration of community involvement and equity, including \n21\nmeaningful participation in cleanup and reuse decisions and the extent to which projects address threats \n22\nto sensitive populations, such as children, pregnant women, and minority or low-income communities.  \n23\nId. § 9604(k)(6)(C)(x). \n24\nd.  The Federal Grant Conditions are arbitrary and capricious. \n25\nThe Federal Grant Conditions are arbitrary and capricious because they fail the basic requirement \n26\nthat agency action be “reasonable and reasonably explained.”  Ohio v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 603 U.S. 279, \n27\n292 (2024) (cleaned up).  To satisfy this requirement, an agency must offer “a satisfactory explanation \n28\n-36- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 51 of 56\n1 for its action” and can neither “rel[y] on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider” nor \n2 simply ignore “an important aspect of the problem . . . .”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State \n3 Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (“State Farm”), 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  While agencies are free to change \n4 their existing policies, they must “display awareness that” they are doing so, provide “good reasons for \n5 the new policy,” and demonstrate that they have taken account of “reliance interests” engendered by the \n6 prior policy.  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  Here, Defendants have \n7 not satisfied any of these requirements.   \n8 First, “an agency must defend its actions based on the reasons it gave when it acted, not with post \n9 hoc rationalizations.”  Lotus Vaping Techs., LLC v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 73 F.4th 657, 668 (9th \n10 Cir. 2023) (cleaned up).  Here, Defendants neither followed required notice-and-comment procedures nor \n11 contemporaneously articulated reasons for imposing the new Federal Grant Conditions.  Even taking at \n12 face value the after-the-fact explanations scattered through various administration communications, they \n13 do not supply a reasoned, non-arbitrary basis for the Federal Grant Conditions.  See King County, 2025 \n14 WL 1582368 at *17 (concluding “that Defendants have failed to demonstrate that the new funding \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 conditions were the result of ‘reasoned decisionmaking,’ let alone have been ‘reasonably explained.’”) \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 Regarding the conditions related to immigration, HUD Secretary Turner stated that the President \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 ordered the changes, describing the Secretary’s “responsibility to effectively implement” EO 14173 and \nN\nN\nE 18 promising senior leadership review to “ensure that HUD programs are compliant” with that order.  See \nR\n19 U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., Letter to Grantees and Stakeholders (Apr. 4, 2025), \n20 https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/2025-04-04-HUD-Grantee-and-Stakeholder-Letter.pdf.  \n21 However, “an executive order is not ‘law,’” California v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 72 F.4th 308, 318 (D.C. \n22 Cir. 2023), and such an order does not exempt an agency from the APA’s requirements of “reasoning, \n23 deliberation, and process,” nor permit “flip-flop[s]” “on the whims of each new administration.”  \n24 California v. Bernhardt, 472 F. Supp. 3d 573, 600–01 (N.D. Cal. 2020).  Invoking a presidential \n25 directive does not relieve an agency of its duty to grapple with “important aspect[s] of the problem,” \n26 State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, including defining critical terms, assessing statutory authority, addressing \n27 programmatic impacts, and considering reliance interests.  The Turner Letter does none of this.   \n28 Similarly, HUD’s Gender Ideology condition is unexplained in light of the Department’s own \n-37- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 52 of 56\n1 binding regulations, which mandate “[e]qual access” to covered programs according to participants’ self-\n2 identified gender.  24 C.F.R. § 5.106(b)–(c).  Neither the Turner Letter nor HUD’s April 2025 press \n3 release addresses this conflict or offers a policy justification for discarding the prior interpretation. \n4 The Secretary Duffy’s communications do not fare any better.  His April 24 letter asserts that \n5 policies “designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals[] presumptively violate[] Federal law” and that DOT \n6 “must ensure that discrimination based on [protected status] does not exist” in funded programs.  RJN, \n7 Ex. P, April Duffy Letter.  However, that statement is not a reasoned explanation for what the Federal \n8 Grant Conditions actually impose—that recipients certify they do not operate any DEI program that DOT \n9 deems impermissible (federally funded or not).  The Duffy Letter also does not acknowledge, much less \n10 explain, its departure from several court decisions holding that affinity groups and other DEI programs \n11 premised on racial, gender, or other classifications and open to all comply with equal protection and \n12 federal nondiscrimination law.  See, e.g., Diemert v. City of Seattle, No. 2:22-cv-1640, 2025 WL 446753, \n13 at *17–18 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 10, 2025) (affinity groups “open to any City employee” did not violate \n14 equal protection); cf. Moranski v. Gen. Motors Corp., 433 F.3d 537, 540–41 (7th Cir. 2005) (recognition \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 of affinity groups based on common social identity did not violate Title VII).  \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 None of these communications provides the kind of contemporaneous, evidence-based reasoning \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 the APA demands.  They do not show that the agencies “considered the relevant factors” or “articulated a \nN\nN\nE 18 rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; see also \nR\n19 Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 785 (the requirement of reasoned decision making ensures agencies provide \n20 genuine justifications subject to judicial and public scrutiny; accepting contrived reasons would render \n21 judicial review an “empty ritual”).  Instead, they reflect bare assertions of presidential direction or \n22 political preference, untethered to statutory authority or the agencies’ missions, and are therefore \n23 arbitrary and capricious.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in establishing that attaching the Federal Grant \n24 Conditions exceeded the agencies’ statutory jurisdiction, violated the Constitution, and was arbitrary and \n25 capricious in violation of the APA.  See Rhode Island Coal. Against Domestic Violence v. Bondi, --- \n26 F.Supp.3d ----, 2025 WL 2271867, at *8 (D.R.I. Aug. 8, 2025). \n27 D.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm If the Conditions Are Not Enjoined \n28 Plaintiffs allege several forms of irreparable harm that are either presently occurring or are likely \n-38- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 53 of 56\n1 to occur in the absence of injunctive relief.  Defendants have put Plaintiffs in the position of having to \n2 choose between accepting unlawful conditions or risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in \n3 federal grant funding, including funding that they have already budgeted and are committed to spending.  \n4 Even if Plaintiffs accepted the vague and unlawful conditions, they would still be at risk of arbitrary \n5 enforcement and legal liability.  It is this looming risk itself that is the injury, and one that Plaintiffs are \n6 already suffering.  Courts evaluating similar circumstances have recognized that this injury of acute \n7 budgetary uncertainty is irreparable.  Cnty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d at 537.  Moreover, \n8 Plaintiffs have submitted substantive and detailed evidence through declarations illustrating the ways in \n9 which a loss of the federal grant funds would be devastating and irreparable if these risks in fact \n10 materialize.  See, e.g., Skei Decl. ¶ 17–18; Bacher Decl.  ¶ 32–37, 39–40; Warhuus Decl. ¶ 20, 31, 32; \n11 Dickinson Decl. ¶ 14–15; Stevenson Diaz Decl. ¶ 28, 30, 32–34; Chen Decl. ¶ 29–30; Liss Decl. ¶ 20–\n12 22, 26; Moore Decl. ¶ 5, 9.  The loss of those funds would result in immediate, irreparable, and \n13 reverberating harms to Plaintiffs—including upending their budgets, pausing crucial infrastructure \n14 projects, and terminating essential public services.  Warhuus Decl. ¶ 20, 31, 32; Stevenson Diaz Decl. ¶ \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15 28, 30, 32–34.  Transportation projects in particular require years of planning and, often, years to \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16 complete.  Without injunctive relief, Plaintiffs will need to divert resources from other projects to \nBn\nPE UAttor 17 compensate or plan around the uncertainty of whether they can accept federal funds, straining their \nN\nN\nE 18 resources and putting other projects in jeopardy.  See, e.g., Barfield Decl. ¶ 9; Darrow ¶ 16–17; Warhuus \nR\n19 Decl. ¶ 20, 31, 32; Dickinson Decl. ¶ 14–15; Stevenson Diaz Decl. ¶ 28, 30, 32–34; Chen Decl. ¶ 29–30; \n20 Liss Decl. ¶ 20–22, 26; Moore Decl. ¶ 5, 9.  Without these funds, planned projects may become too \n21 expensive to undertake, requiring them to be modified or canceled.  See, e.g., Barfield Decl. ¶ 9; Darrow \n22 ¶ 16–17; Warhuus Decl. ¶ 20, 31, 32; Dickinson Decl. ¶ 14–15; Stevenson Diaz Decl. ¶ 28, 30, 32–34; \n23 Chen Decl. ¶ 29–30; Liss Decl. ¶ 20–22, 26; Moore Decl. ¶ 5, 9.  As a result of potential loss and \n24 uncertainty surrounding these grants, Plaintiffs will face dire consequences for their transportation \n25 infrastructure and resident safety.  The harms Plaintiffs allege are “quintessentially” irreparable.  See \n26 Martin Luther King, Jr. Cnty. v. Turner, 2025 WL 2322763, at *16. \n27 Additionally, as shown above, the Federal Grant Conditions likely violate due process, Separation \n28 of Powers, the Spending Clause, and the Tenth Amendment.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have also made a \n-39- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 54 of 56\n1 sufficient showing of irreparable harm that would result from enforcement of those provisions, as it is \n2 “well established that the deprivation of constitutional rights ‘unquestionably constitutes irreparable \n3 injury.’” Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 994 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 \n4 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012)).   \n5 E.  The Balance of Equities Weighs in Plaintiffs’ Favor, and a Preliminary Injunction Is \nin the Public Interest \n6\nThe equities and public interest, which merge when the government is a party, tip sharply in \n7\nPlaintiffs’ favor.  Wolford v. Lopez, 116 F.4th 959, 976 (9th Cir. 2024).  Plaintiffs face immediate and \n8\nirreparable harm from the enforcement of grant conditions that threaten vital funding for public programs \n9\nand services.  By contrast, the federal government’s interest in imposing these new conditions before the \n10\nlegality of its actions has been adjudicated is minimal.  Preserving Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and \n11\npreventing the government from enforcing potentially unlawful conditions, clearly serves the public \n12\ninterest.  See Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1002 (“[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of \n13\na party’s constitutional rights.”) (cleaned up). \n14\n P\nU Whatever interest the Executive may have in introducing new grant conditions at this stage of the \nO\nGRw  15\nW La grant cycle, and in enforcing them during the pendency of this litigation, that interest pales in comparison \nLLIC Aeys at  16 to the constitutional and programmatic harms Plaintiffs will suffer.  As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, \nBn\nPE UAttor 17\nN “by establishing a likelihood that [the government’s] policy violates the U.S. Constitution,” Plaintiffs \nN\nE 18\nR\nhave also “established that both the public interest and the balance of the equities favor a preliminary \n19\ninjunction.” Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1069 (9th Cir. 2014).  Accordingly, the \n20\nbalance of equities and the public interest decisively support interim relief here. \n21\nV.  CONCLUSION \n22\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue a preliminary \n23\ninjunction enjoining Defendants from imposing or enforcing the Federal Grant Conditions or any \n24\nmaterially similar terms or conditions to any federal funds received by or awarded to Plaintiffs, directly \n25\nor indirectly, in accordance with Plaintiffs’ Proposed Preliminary Injunction Order accompanying this \n26\nfiling.  Immediate relief is necessary to preserve the status quo, prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and \n27\ntheir residents, and uphold the constitutional and statutory limits on executive authority. \n28\n-40- \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION – CASE NO. 3:25-cv-07070-RS \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 36     Filed 09/08/25     Page 55 of 56\n1  \nDated:  September 8, 2025  RENNE PUBLIC LAW GROUP \n2\n \n \n3\nBy:   /s/ Jonathan V.

INTRODUCTION \n2  Plaintiffs bring this action reluctantly, only after the current Administration’s actions have left \n3  them no other means of protecting the federal funding essential to their communities.  For years, \n4  Plaintiffs have relied on congressionally authorized grant programs to deliver core public services that \n5  safeguard public safety and health, connect residents to opportunity, and sustain local economies.  They \n6  have endeavored to work cooperatively with federal agencies to administer these programs, but the \n7  lawful and predictable administration of these grants has now been upended. \n8  The Constitution vests Congress—not the Executive—with the authority to make laws and \n9  appropriate federal funds.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8; Cunningham v. Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 83–84 (1890).  \n10  While the Executive Branch is charged with faithfully executing the laws enacted by Congress, that duty \n11  does not include the power to unilaterally rewrite or expand the statutory terms under which federal \n12  funds are awarded.  City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931, 945 (9th Cir. 2019); City & Cnty. of San \n13  Francisco v. Barr, 965 F.3d 753, 766 (9th Cir. 2020). \n14  Here, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the U.S. Department of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and the U.S. \nW La\nLLIC Aeys at  16  Department of Transportation (“DOT”)—including its operating administrations1 such as the Federal \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Transit Administration (“FTA”), the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”), and the Federal \nN\nN\nRE 18  Aviation Administration (“FAA”) (collectively, the “Defendants”)—have imposed vague and \n19  unauthorized conditions on federal grants to coerce compliance with executive policy preferences.  These \n20  actions exceed Defendants’ constitutional and statutory authority, erode the separation of powers, and \n21  disregard core constitutional and statutory protections, including the Tenth Amendment’s anti-\n22  commandeering principle, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the Administrative \n23  Procedure Act’s (“APA”) procedural safeguards. \n24  Defendants’ overbroad interpretation and enforcement of these conditions are not hypothetical.  \n25  On or around August 18, 2025, the City of Fresno received an email from HUD notifying it that HUD “is \n26   \n1 The FAA, FTA, FHWA, and similar modal agencies within the DOT are officially known as \n27  “Operating Administrations.”  See 49 C.F.R. § 9.3 (defining ‘operating administrations’ to include FAA, \nFTA, FHWA, and others within the Department of Transportation); 49 C.F.R. pt. 1, subpt. D (delegating \n28  authority to Operating Administrations). \n    -3-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 4 of 96\n1  questioning the accuracy of the City of Fresno’s certification that the Community Development Block \n2  Grant (CDBG) funds described in its Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action Plan (the Plan) will be \n3  administered in conformity with applicable laws, including Executive Orders.”  HUD has directed Fresno \n4  to remove all references to the words “equity,” “environmental justice,” and all transgender references, \n5  and provide assurances that “[t]he City of Fresno shall not use grant funds to promote ‘gender ideology,’ \n6  as defined in Executive Order (E.O.) 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and \n7  Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”  HUD directed Fresno to take these actions no \n8  later than 12:00 pm EDT Thursday, August 21, 2025, and provided that “failure to address HUD’s \n9  concerns regarding the certification may result in HUD determining that the certification is inaccurate or \n10  unsatisfactory, which will result in disapproval of the Plan.” \n11  Defendants’ unlawful attempts to repurpose congressionally established grant programs to serve \n12  unilateral policy goals have placed at risk hundreds of millions of dollars in funding already awarded or \n13  soon to be awarded to Plaintiffs.  If allowed to stand, these unauthorized and unlawful conditions will \n14  severely compromise Plaintiffs’ ability to maintain safe and reliable transportation infrastructure, ensure \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  aviation safety, public health, and sustain essential transit services.  These consequences would ripple \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  across the economy, leaving Plaintiffs more vulnerable to accidents, service failures, and disinvestment.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Plaintiffs, therefore, have been forced to file this suit not out of preference, but out of necessity, seeking \nN\nN\nRE 18  declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of these unlawful conditions and to preserve \n19  their ability to carry out the federally funded programs their residents depend on. \n20  II.  JURISDICTION \n21  1.  The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  This Court has further remedial \n22  authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202 et seq. \n23  2.  Venue properly lies within the Northern District of California because this is an action \n24  against an officer or employee of the United States and an agency of the United States, Plaintiff City of \n25  Eureka resides in this judicial district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this \n26  action occurred in this district.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \n27  3.  Divisional Assignment:  Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 3-2, except as provided in Civil \n28  L.R. 3-2(c), all civil actions that arise in Humboldt County, except for cases not assigned to the \n    -4-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 5 of 96\n1  Magistrate Judges pursuant to the Court’s Assignment Plan, shall be assigned to the Eureka Division.  \n2  This action arises in Humboldt County.   \n3  III.  PARTIES \n4  4.  Plaintiff City of Fresno is a municipal corporation and charter city organized and existing \n5  under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California.  Fresno’s city-operated airports have been \n6  allocated approximately $50 million in FAA grants for capital improvement projects and anticipate \n7  approximately $100 million in additional grant funding to complete planned airport infrastructure \n8  improvements, including the construction of a new air traffic control tower.  If Fresno does not accept the \n9  FAA’s newly imposed conditions and submit its reimbursement request by the end of September, more \n10  than $13 million in already allocated and expended grant funds will lapse, leaving Fresno unable to \n11  recover those funds. \n12  5.  Fresno has also been awarded or allocated approximately $11.7 million annually in HUD \n13  grants administered through various programs under HUD’s Office of Community Planning and \n14  Development (“CPD”), over $100 million in DOT grants, described further below, to fund a broad range \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  of transportation and infrastructure projects, and $2.2 million in Brownfields grants from the EPA.  \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  6.  Plaintiff County of Sacramento is a political subdivision of the State of California and a \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  home rule charter County.  County of Sacramento owns and operates the County’s Airport System, \nN\nN\nRE 18  consisting of four airports: Sacramento International (“SMF”), Mather (“MHR”), Sacramento Executive \n19  (“SAC”), and Franklin Field (“F72”)—through its Department of Airports, except for SAC, which is \n20  leased from the City of Sacramento.  The Airport System operates as a self-supporting enterprise fund, \n21  relying solely on airport revenues and federal funding, with no local tax dollars.  \n22  7.  County of Sacramento depends heavily on FAA grants, including Airport Improvement \n23  Program (“AIP”) entitlement and discretionary grants, and Airport Infrastructure Grants (“AIG”) and \n24  Airport Terminal Program (“ATP”) grants.  From 2021 through 2023, the County received a total of \n25  $22,498,822 in AIP grants.  In 2024, the FAA awarded the Airport System $14,573,636 in AIP grants.  \n26  To date, the FAA also has awarded $45,166,763 in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”) \n27  grants to the Airport System.  In addition to these grants, the FAA has set aside approximately $70 \n28  million to relocate and construct a new air traffic control tower at SMF.  The County expects to receive \n    -5-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 6 of 96\n1  approximately $9.5 million in grant funding for additional rehabilitation work on Runway 4R/22L at \n2  MHR.  To continue meeting the needs of the Airport System’s rapidly growing catchment area, the \n3  Department also will apply for, and anticipates receiving, an additional $167.5 million in combined AIP \n4  and IIJA grants to finance various capital projects.   \n5  8.  In 2024, County of Sacramento secured a Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \n6  Innovation Act (“TIFIA”) loan from DOT’s Build America Bureau, which provides low-cost loans to \n7  eligible large-scale infrastructure projects.  The $36.1 million TIFIA loan is also financing the Pedestrian \n8  Walkway Project, which is scheduled to open in the summer of 2026. \n9  9.  County of Sacramento’s Department of Health Services encompasses Behavioral Health \n10  Services, Public Health, Primary Care Services, and Correctional Health Services.  The County also \n11  owns and operates a federally qualified health center (“FQHC”), known as the County of Sacramento \n12  Health Center.  The County’s Health budget relies on many millions of dollars in federal funding, \n13  including sizeable grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and its \n14  divisions.  Currently, the County holds direct and sub-recipient federal grant allocations from HHS, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  including HRSA, CDC, SAMHSA, and other DHHS Administrative agencies, totaling nearly $148 \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  million.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  10.  County of Sacramento receives HUD funding for the support of critical and essential \nN\nN\nRE 18  homeless services and housing programs and projects as a passthrough subrecipient entity from \n19  Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency (“SHRA”) and Sacramento Steps Forward (“SSF”), \n20  the lead agency for Sacramento’s Continuum of Care (“CoC”).  Currently, about $277,500 of Emergency \n21  Solutions Grant (“ESG”) and $363,000 Community Development Block Grant Programs (“CDBG”) \n22  Public Service funds are used to operate the Mather Community Campus Singles Shelter, which provides \n23  shelter, supportive services, and re-housing for up to 150 adults.  \n24  11.  County of Sacramento relies on federal funding from the DOT, FHWA, and FTA to \n25  provide critical transportation planning and improvements.  For FY2025, the County was allocated \n26  $463,882 in Section 5311 grant funds and has received the updated FTA Certifications and Assurances \n27  that must be executed within the next few weeks to maintain eligibility for continued FTA formula \n28  grants.  In FYs 2023–2024 and 2024–2025, the County received approximately $47,991,689 in FHWA \n    -6-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 7 of 96\n1  funds to support bridge replacement, street rehabilitation, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, and \n2  other critical projects, and for FY 2025–2026 it has budgeted an additional $33 million in FHWA \n3  funding for similar work.  The County has also been awarded two discretionary FHWA grants: $800,000 \n4  from the Bridge Investment Program and $1,859,680 from the Advanced Transportation Technology and \n5  Innovation Program for its County of Sacramento Complete Pedestrian Trips project.  In total, these \n6  federal transportation funds amount to approximately $84 million. \n7  12.  Plaintiff City of South Lake Tahoe is a municipal corporation organized under the existing \n8  laws of the State of California.  The City of South Lake Tahoe owns and operates the Lake Tahoe Airport \n9  (“TVL”) as a division of its Public Works Department and serves as the airport sponsor for purposes of \n10  federal grant funding.  TVL is a general aviation airport and is the only airport within the Lake Tahoe \n11  Basin, thereby serving an important role in the area’s economy and a critical role in public safety for \n12  aircraft access and emergency response staging during large-scale emergencies such as wildfires. \n13  13.  The City of South Lake Tahoe depends on FAA grants to support critical capital projects \n14  and maintenance to comply with federally imposed safety requirements, including AIP entitlement and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  discretionary grants, and AIG grants.  Annually, the City of South Lake Tahoe receives approximately \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  $150,000 in AIP entitlement funds and was allocated $556,000 in AIG grants for Fiscal Years 2022–\nBn\nPE UAttor 17  2025.  The City currently holds FAA grant allocations totaling approximately $1,050,000 for critical \nN\nN\nRE 18  capital projects, including its Pavement Maintenance and Management Program and Airport Master Plan.  \n19  The City of South Lake Tahoe anticipates needing approximately $20 million in FAA funding over the \n20  next three years for Taxiway Alpha Reconstruction, a project necessary to maintain compliance with \n21  federal safety standards and ensure safe aircraft operations. \n22  14.  Plaintiff City of Eureka is a municipal corporation and charter city organized and existing \n23  under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California.

Congress established HUD in 1965 to promote the “sound development of the Nation’s \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  communities and metropolitan areas” by, among other things, administering programs that “provide \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  assistance for housing” and “development.”  Department of Housing and Urban Development Act, 1965 \nN\nN\nRE 18  § 2, Pub. L. No. 89-174, 79 Stat. 667.  The HUD Secretary is responsible for all actions taken by the \n19  Department and its component offices.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 3533, 3535; 24 C.F.R. Part 5.  HUD \n20  administers both competitive and formula grant programs.  Competitive grant programs “allocate[] a \n21  limited pool of funds to state and local applicants whose applications are approved by” a federal agency.  \n22  City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 F.3d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir. 2019).  Entitlement grant programs \n23  (sometimes referred to as formula grant programs) “are awarded pursuant to a statutory formula” wherein \n24  “Congress determines who the recipients are and how much money each shall receive.”  City of Los \n25  Angeles v. McLaughlin, 865 F.2d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 1989) (cleaned up).  HUD administers grants \n26  directly and through its program offices, including the Office of Community Planning & Development \n27  (CPD), and regional field offices.  See 24 C.F.R. subchapter C (CPD-administered programs); id. § \n28  982.101 (allocating budget authority for Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program to field offices).  \n    -10-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 11 of 96\n1  1.  Community Development Block Grant Program \n2  36.  Congress established the Community Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) program \n3  through Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the “HCD Act”), Pub. L. 93-\n4  383, 88 Stat. 633, and subsequent amendments.  The program’s stated “primary objective” is to promote \n5  “development of viable urban communities” through “decent housing,” a “suitable living environment,” \n6  and “expan[sion of] economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income.”  42 \n7  U.S.C. § 5301(c).  Specific objectives include “conserv[ing] and expan[ding] the Nation’s housing stock” \n8  especially for low- and moderate-income households, promoting mixed-income communities, and \n9  enhancing the “diversity and vitality of neighborhoods” by eliminating slums or blight and revitalizing \n10  “deteriorating or deteriorated neighborhoods,” among other goals.  Id. § 5301(c)(1), (c)(3), (c)(6). \n11  37.  The CDBG program is codified at title 42, chapter 69 of the U.S. Code.  The program \n12  provides flexible funding through annual block grants awarded on a formula basis to state and local \n13  governments for purposes related to economic and community development.  In enacting the program, \n14  Congress consolidated “a number of complex and overlapping” grant programs such that funding would \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  be provided “on an annual basis, with maximum certainty and minimum delay,” and communities could \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  “rely [on funding] in their planning.”  Id. § 5301(d).  The HCD Act permits communities to tailor \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  program activities to meet local needs so long as they advance national objectives identified by Congress, \nN\nN\nRE 18  including benefiting low- and moderate-income persons, preventing or eliminating slums or blight, or, in \n19  certain cases, responding to serious and immediate threats to community health or welfare where other \n20  funds are unavailable.  Id. §§ 5301(c), 5304(b)(4). \n21  38.  The HCD Act authorizes the HUD Secretary to award CDBG funds using statutorily \n22  prescribed selection criteria.  42 U.S.C. §§ 5303–04.  The HUD Secretary must distribute funds annually \n23  using a formula that considers population and measures of distress including poverty, age of housing, \n24  housing overcrowding, and growth lag.  Id. §§ 5303–04, 5306.  These grants fund vital urban community \n25  development projects and public services administered by grant recipients either directly or through \n26  service providers contracted by the grant recipient.  See id. § 5305 (listing activities eligible for \n27  assistance). \n28   \n    -11-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 12 of 96\n1  a.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and HUD Promulgates Rules \n2  Regarding CDBG Grant Conditions  \n3  39.  HUD’s administration of the CDBG program, including the award of block grants, is \n4  authorized and governed by statutory directives.  Congress has specified what activities are eligible for \n5  funding under the CDBG program, the selection criteria HUD must apply in awarding CDBG grants, and \n6  program requirements HUD can require recipients agree to as conditions for receiving funds.  See 42 \n7  U.S.C. §§ 5301, 5304–05.   \n8  40.  Section 103 of the HCD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 5303, contains Congress’s overarching \n9  authorization to award CDBG funding.  That provision states in relevant part: “The Secretary is \n10  authorized to make grants to States, units of general local government, and Indian tribes to carry out \n11  activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.” \n12  41.  In addition to the statutory objectives and allocation formula discussed above, Congress \n13  has imposed other requirements on CDBG funds.  For instance, 42 U.S.C. § 5305 limits the use of \n14  CDBG funds to enumerated eligible activities.  The HCD Act also mandates that recipients use at least \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  70% of CDBG funds on activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, id. § \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  5301(c), and prescribes eligibility criteria for such activities, id. § 5305(c).  Grant recipients must also \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  submit annual plans to the HUD Secretary describing their priority nonhousing community development \nN\nN\nRE 18  needs eligible for CDBG funding pursuant to procedures set out in the HCD Act.  Id. § 5304(m).  Finally, \n19  Congress has enumerated various certifications that CDBG recipients must make as a condition of \n20  receiving funds, including that the recipient will develop and follow a citizen participation plan, comply \n21  with statutory transparency requirements, ensure funds are consistent with the HCD Act’s objectives, and \n22  administer programs in conformity with nondiscrimination laws.  Id. § 5304(a)(3), (b). \n23  42.  The HCD Act does not authorize HUD to condition CDBG funding on prohibiting all \n24  forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or \n25  prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  \n26  43.  The HCD Act indicates congressional intent to benefit historically disadvantaged groups.  \n27  For example, the Act requires the Secretary to set aside some of the funds appropriated for the CDBG \n28  program for “special purpose grants,” which may include, among other things, grants to “historically \n    -12-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 13 of 96\n1  Black colleges.”  42 U.S.C. § 5307(b)(2).  The Act further provides that, of the amount set aside for \n2  special purpose grants, the Secretary “shall” make grants to institutions of higher education “for the \n3  purpose of providing assistance to economically disadvantaged and minority students who participate in \n4  community development work study programs and are enrolled in” qualifying degree programs.  Id. § \n5  5307(c).  The Act also authorizes urban development action grants to cities and urban counties \n6  experiencing severe economic distress, but only if the HUD Secretary determines the city or county has \n7  “demonstrated results in,” among other things, “providing equal opportunity in housing and employment \n8  for low- and moderate-income persons and members of minority groups.”  Id. § 5318(a)–(b).  \n9  44.  Congress has authorized the HUD Secretary to promulgate “rules and regulations” \n10  necessary to carrying out the Secretary’s “functions, powers, and duties.”  42 U.S.C. § 3535(d). \n11  45.  Pursuant to this authority, HUD has promulgated the CDBG program rule at 24 C.F.R. \n12  part 570 (the “CDBG Rule”), which, among other things, imposes additional restrictions on the use of \n13  CDBG funds.  See 24 C.F.R. § 570.207.  The CDBG Rule also obligates grant recipients to submit \n14  annual consolidated plans in accordance with 24 C.F.R. part 91. 24 C.F.R. § 570.302.  These annual \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  consolidated plans must include additional certifications enumerated in HUD regulations, including that \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  the recipient complies with lead-based paint procedures and has policies barring the use of excessive \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  force against non-violent civil rights demonstrators.  24 C.F.R. § 91.225. \nN\nN\nRE 18  46.  The CDBG Rule does not impose any conditions on CDBG funding related to prohibiting \n19  all forms of DEI policies and initiatives, participating in immigration enforcement, verification of \n20  immigration status, opposing transgender acceptance, or cutting off access to information about lawful \n21  abortions. \n22  b.  Congress Appropriates CDBG Grant Funding \n23  47.  Funding for CDBG grants comes from congressional discretionary appropriations. \n24  48.  Most recently, Congress appropriated funds for the CDBG program in the 2024 \n25  Appropriations Act.  The 2024 Appropriations Act contains additional directives to HUD regarding \n26  CDBG funding.  For instance, it requires that no more than 20% of any grant under the CDBG program \n27  may be expended for certain planning and administrative purposes and imposes limitations on funds \n28  provided to for-profit entities.  138 Stat. 358–59. \n    -13-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 14 of 96\n1  49.  None of the 2024 Appropriations Act’s directives to HUD or any other legislation \n2  authorize HUD to impose CDBG grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating \n3  enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \n4  “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n5  2.  Emergency Solutions Grant Program \n6  a.  Congress Authorizes the Establishment of the Emergency Solutions \n7  Grant Program Through the HEARTH Act \n8  50.  In 2009, Congress established the Emergency Solutions Grant (“ESG”) program through \n9  the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (“HEARTH”) Act, Pub. L. 111-\n10  22, 123 Stat. 1663.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 11371–11378.  In enacting the HEARTH Act, Congress sought to \n11  remedy the “lack of affordable housing and limited scale of housing assistance programs” that it found to \n12  be “the primary causes of homelessness” and “establish a Federal goal of ensuring that individuals and \n13  families who become homeless return to permanent housing within 30 days.”  HEARTH Act, § 1002, \n14  123 Stat. 1664. 317.   \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  51.  The HEARTH Act amended the Homeless Assistance Act to expand what had been \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  known as the Emergency Shelter Grant program, which provided formula funding to state and local \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  governments for the short-term needs of homeless individuals.  Reflecting a broadened focus on factors \nN\nN\nRE 18  that lead to homelessness, the HEARTH Act expanded the activities eligible for funding under the new \n19  ESG program to include short- or medium-term rental assistance and housing relocation and stabilization \n20  services, in addition to emergency shelters, homelessness prevention, and supportive services, which had \n21  been covered under the original program.  See 42 U.S.C. § 11374(a). \n22  52.  The Homeless Assistance Act, as amended by the HEARTH Act, directs the Secretary of \n23  HUD to award ESG grants to cities, urban counties, and states on a non-competitive basis using HUD’s \n24  formula for allocating CDBG funds, discussed above.  42 U.S.C. §§ 11372, 11373(a).  These grants fund \n25  programs that address the most critical and immediate needs of those experiencing or at risk of \n26  homelessness, including programs for preventing homelessness, immediately rehousing individuals who \n27  become homeless, and providing emergency shelter to those experiencing homelessness.  Id. § 11374(a). \n28   \n    -14-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 15 of 96\n1  b.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directive, and HUD Promulgates Rules, \n2  Regarding ESG Grant Conditions  \n3  53.  HUD’s administration of the ESG program, including the award of ESG funds, is \n4  authorized and governed by statutory directives.  Congress has specified what activities are eligible for \n5  funding under the ESG program, the responsibilities of ESG recipients, and specific certifications ESG \n6  recipients must agree to as a condition of receiving funds.  42 U.S.C. §§ 11374(a), 11375. \n7  54.  Congress’s overarching direction to HUD to award ESG grants is codified at 42 U.S.C. § \n8  11372, which provides: \n9  The Secretary shall make grants to States and local governments (and to \nprivate nonprofit organizations providing assistance to persons \n10  experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, in the case of grants \nmade with reallocated amounts) for the purpose of carrying out activities \n11  described in section 11374 of this title.  \n12  55.  Section 11374 of Title 42 limits the activities for which ESG funds may be used to \n13  specific services: maintaining, operating, or renovating emergency shelters; providing supportive \n14  services related to emergency shelter or street outreach; paying short- or medium-term rental assistance; \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  and providing housing relocation or stabilization services for homeless or at-risk individuals and \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  families. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  56.  Section 11375 of Title 42 sets forth certifications that recipients must make to the \nN\nN\nRE 18  Secretary of HUD regarding their use of ESG funds.  Recipients must certify that, among other things, \n19  they will operate facilities that receive funding as homeless shelters for a specified number of years, any \n20  ESG-funded renovation will be sufficient to ensure the shelter is safe and sanitary, they will assist \n21  homeless individuals in obtaining permanent housing and services such as medical and mental health \n22  treatment and counseling, and they will involve homeless individuals and families through employment, \n23  volunteer services, or otherwise, in constructing and operating shelters to the maximum extent \n24  practicable. 42 U.S.C. § 11375(c). \n25  57.  The HEARTH Act does not authorize HUD to condition ESG funding on prohibiting all \n26  forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or \n27  prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n28  58.  Section 11376 of Title 42 authorizes the Secretary of HUD “by notice” to “establish such \n    -15-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 16 of 96\n1  requirements as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of” the ESG program.  “Such requirements \n2  shall be subject to section 553 of title 5,” which requires rulemaking to occur pursuant to notice and \n3  comment procedures.  42 U.S.C. § 11376.  \n4  59.  Pursuant to this authority, HUD has promulgated the ESG Rule at 24 C.F.R. part 576, \n5  which sets forth additional requirements and conditions on ESG funding.  See 24 C.F.R. §§ 576.400–\n6  576.409.  For instance, the ESG Rule requires ESG recipients to meet minimum safety, sanitation, and \n7  privacy standards for emergency shelters; integrate ESG services with other programs targeted to \n8  homeless individuals in the area; coordinate with local Continuums; conduct initial evaluations of \n9  program participants consistent with HUD requirements; and abide by recordkeeping and reporting \n10  requirements.  Id. §§ 576.400, 576.401, 576.403(b), 576.500.  \n11  60.  The ESG Rule also obligates ESG recipients to submit and obtain HUD approval of a \n12  consolidated plan in accordance with the requirements in 24 C.F.R. part 91.  Id. § 576.200. HUD’s \n13  consolidated planning regulations set forth additional certifications that must be included in a \n14  consolidated plan, including that the jurisdiction will affirmatively further fair housing, is in compliance \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  with anti-lobbying requirements, and possesses the legal authority to carry out programs for which it is \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  seeking funding, among other certifications.  Id. § 91.225(a). \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  61.  Neither the ESG Rule nor HUD’s consolidated planning regulations impose any \nN\nN\nRE 18  conditions on ESG funding related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \n19  immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n20  ideology” or “elective abortion.”  Congress has not delegated authority that would permit an agency to \n21  adopt such conditions.  \n22  62.  Funding for the ESG program comes from congressional discretionary appropriations. \n23  63.  Most recently, Congress appropriated funds for the ESG program in the 2024 \n24  Appropriations Act, 138 Stat. at 362.  \n25  64.  Nothing in the 2024 Appropriations Act or any other legislation authorizes HUD to \n26  impose ESG grant fund conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of \n27  federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n28  ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n    -16-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 17 of 96\n1  3.  HOME Investment Partnerships Program \n2  65.  Congress established the HOME program through the HOME Investment Partnerships \n3  Act (HOME Act), under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (“NAHA”), \n4  Pub. L. No. 101–625, 104 Stat. 4079, and subsequent amendments.  The HOME program is a formula \n5  grant program that aims to help state and local governments implement local housing strategies to \n6  increase affordable housing opportunities for low-income families.  The HOME program requires the \n7  HUD Secretary “to make funds available to participating jurisdictions for investment to increase the \n8  number of families served with decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing and expand the long-term \n9  supply of affordable housing.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 12741, 12747(b). \n10  66.  Participating jurisdictions may use HOME grants for a variety of housing activities.  \n11  These include providing “incentives to develop and support affordable rental housing and \n12  homeownership affordability through the acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, or moderate or \n13  substantial rehabilitation of affordable housing.”  42 U.S.C. § 12742(a)(1).  \n14  67.  Participating jurisdictions must allocate matching funds to affordable housing projects \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  equivalent to at least 25 percent of the HOME funds the jurisdictions use.  42 U.S.C. § 12750. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  a.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and HUD Promulgates Rules, \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Regarding HOME Grant Conditions \nN\nN\nRE 18  68.  HUD’s administration of the HOME program is authorized and governed by statutory \n19  directives.  The HOME Act specifies the eligibility requirements to become a participating jurisdiction, \n20  the permissible and prohibited uses of HOME funds, the maximum incomes of families who may receive \n21  HOME funds, and what housing qualifies as affordable for purposes of the program.  42 U.S.C. §§ \n22  12742, 12744, 12475, 12476. \n23  69.  The HOME Act does not grant HUD discretion in designating which jurisdictions may \n24  participate and under what circumstances those jurisdictions shall receive HOME funds.  It instead \n25  directs the HUD Secretary to establish by regulation the statutorily specified procedures with which \n26  states and local governments must comply to be designated as participating jurisdictions and receive \n27  allocations of HOME funds.  42 U.S.C. § 12746.  The HOME Act provides that such regulations “shall \n28  only provide for the” requirements for allocation, eligibility, notification, submission, reallocation, \n    -17-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 18 of 96\n1  revocation, and reduction of funds listed in the statute.  Id. § 12746(1)–(10) (emphasis added).  Once a \n2  jurisdiction meets the statutory formula and complies with the listed requirements, HUD “shall \n3  designate” it “a participating jurisdiction” and the jurisdiction “shall remain a participating jurisdiction \n4  for subsequent fiscal years” unless certain revocation conditions are met.  Id. § 12746(7)–(8) (emphasis \n5  added). \n6  70.  The HOME Act further directs the HUD Secretary to “establish by regulation an \n7  allocation formula that reflects each jurisdiction’s share of total need among eligible jurisdiction[s] for an \n8  increased supply of affordable housing for very low-income and low-income families of different size.”  \n9  42 U.S.C. § 12747(b)(1)(A).  This formula must be based on the “objective measures” specified in the \n10  HOME Act.  Id. \n11  71.  The Home Act further directs the HUD Secretary to establish a HOME Investment Trust \n12  Fund for each participating jurisdiction, along with a line of credit that includes the participating \n13  jurisdiction’s allocated HOME funds.  42 U.S.C. § 12748(a)–(b). \n14  72.  As directed by Congress, HUD promulgated the HOME program rule at 24 C.F.R. part 92 \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  (the “HOME Rule”).  The HOME Rule implements the allocation formula prescribed by Congress, along \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  with the eligibility and related requirements listed in the HOME Act.  See, e.g., 24 C.F.R. §§ 92.50, \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  92.102–07, 92.150, 92.200–22.  The HOME Rule also lists other federal requirements with which \nN\nN\nRE 18  participating jurisdictions must comply, including the nondiscrimination requirements that apply to all \n19  HUD Programs, listed at 24 C.F.R. § 5.105(a), as well as the nondiscrimination requirements in the \n20  HOME Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12832, addressed below.  24 C.F.R. § 92.350. \n21  73.  Neither Congress nor HUD’s regulations authorize HUD to condition HOME funding on \n22  prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of \n23  immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n24  74.  NAHA and the HOME Act indicate congressional intent to benefit historically \n25  disadvantaged groups.  One of Congress’s objectives in enacting NAHA was to “improve housing \n26  opportunities for all residents of the United States, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities, on \n27  a nondiscriminatory basis.”  42 U.S.C. § 12702(3).  The HOME Act requires participating jurisdictions \n28  “to establish and oversee a minority outreach program . . . to ensure the inclusion, to the maximum extent \n    -18-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 19 of 96\n1  possible, of minorities and women, and entities owned by minorities and women . . . in all contracts[] \n2  entered into by the participating jurisdiction . . . to provide affordable housing authorized under this Act.”  \n3  Id. § 12831(a).  The HOME Act also forbids participating jurisdictions from denying benefits to or \n4  otherwise discriminating against any person “on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion, or \n5  sex.”  Id. § 12832. \n6  75.  In January 2025, HUD issued a final rule amending the HOME Rule “to update, simplify, \n7  or streamline requirements, better align the program with other Federal housing programs, and \n8  implement recent amendments to the HOME statute.”  HOME Investment Partnerships Program: \n9  Program Updates and Streamlining, 90 Fed. Reg. 746, 746 (Jan. 6, 2025).  The revised HOME Rule does \n10  not add any grant conditions related to DEI, immigration enforcement, verification of immigration status, \n11  “gender ideology,” or abortion.  The revised HOME Rule was originally set to become effective \n12  February 5, 2025, but HUD delayed parts of the Rule until October 2025.

Congress Appropriates HOME Grant Finding   \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  76.  Funding for the HOME program comes from congressional discretionary appropriations. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  77.  Most recently, Congress appropriated $1,250,000,000 for the HOME program in the 2024 \nN\nN\nRE 18  Appropriations Act. 38 Stat. 360.  The 2024 Appropriations Act contains additional directives to HUD \n19  regarding HOME funding.  For instance, it extends the statutory deadline for participating jurisdictions to \n20  draw funds from their HOME Investment Trust Fund.  Id. \n21  78.  None of the 2024 Appropriations Act’s directives to HUD or any other legislation \n22  authorize HUD to impose HOME grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating \n23  enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \n24  “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n25  4.  The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program \n26  79.  Congress established the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (“HOPWA”) \n27  program through the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act, Subtitle D of Title VIII of NAHA, Pub. L. No. \n28  101–625, 104 Stat. 4079, and subsequent amendments.  The objective of the HOPWA program is “to \n    -19-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 20 of 96\n1  provide States and localities with the resources and incentives to devise long-term comprehensive \n2  strategies for meeting the housing needs of persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and \n3  families of such persons.”  42 U.S.C. § 12901.  To meet this aim, the program authorizes formula grants \n4  and competitively awarded grants to provide housing assistance and related supportive services to meet \n5  the housing needs of low-income persons living with HIV or AIDS and their families. \n6  80.  The HOPWA program permits grant recipients to use HOPWA funds for a number of \n7  housing programs for persons living with HIV or AIDS, including providing information and services, \n8  short-term housing, rental assistance, development of single room occupancy dwellings, and \n9  development and operation of community residences.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12906–910. \n10  81.  Ninety percent of HOPWA funds must be allocated pursuant to a statutory formula based \n11  on total population, the number of persons living with HIV or AIDS, fair market rents, and poverty data.  \n12  42 U.S.C. § 12903(c)(1)(A).  The HUD Secretary must award the remaining 10 percent of grant funds on \n13  a competitive basis to states and local governments not eligible for a formula grant, or to states, local \n14  governments, or nonprofits seeking funding for “special projects of national significance.”  Id. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  § 12903(c)(5)(A), (C). \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  a.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and HUD Promulgates Rules \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Regarding HOPWA Grant Conditions \nN\nN\nRE 18  82.  To be eligible for HOPWA funds, states and local governments must submit an \n19  application for the HUD Secretary’s approval.  42 U.S.C. § 12903(d).  Congress instructed the HUD \n20  Secretary to establish by regulation procedures for the submission of applications using specified \n21  requirements.  Id. § 12903(d)(1)–(6).  Congress also permitted the HUD Secretary to require “other \n22  information or certifications” but only to the extent “necessary to achieve the purposes of this section,” \n23  i.e., to award formula and competitive grants pursuant to the statutorily listed criteria.  Id. § 12903(d)(6). \n24  83.  Pursuant to this authority, HUD promulgated the HOPWA program rule at 24 C.F.R. part \n25  574 (the “HOPWA Rule”).  The HOPWA Rule implements the allocation formula prescribed in the \n26  statute, as well as the permissible uses of HOPWA funds.  24 C.F.R. §§ 574.110, 130, 300.  The Rule \n27  also creates an application process for competitive grants, requiring applications “comply with the \n28  provisions of the Department’s Notice of Funding Availability (“NOFA”) for the fiscal year.”  Id. \n    -20-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 21 of 96\n1  § 574.240.  The HOPWA Rule also sets out conditions grantees and project sponsors must agree to, \n2  including compliance with HUD regulations and “such other terms and conditions . . . as HUD may \n3  establish for purposes of carrying out the program in an effective and efficient manner.”  Id. § 574.500 \n4  (emphasis added).  The HOPWA Rule further lists other federal requirements with which participating \n5  jurisdictions must comply, including the nondiscrimination requirements that apply to all HUD programs \n6  listed at 24 C.F.R. § 5.105(a).  24 C.F.R. § 574.603. \n7  84.  Neither NAHA nor the HOPWA Rule permit HUD to condition HOPWA funding on \n8  prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of \n9  immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n10  85.  As discussed above, NAHA, which established the HOPWA program, indicates \n11  congressional intent to benefit historically disadvantaged groups, including the aim to “improve housing \n12  opportunities for . . . members of disadvantaged minorities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12702(3). \n13  b.  Congress Appropriates HOPWA Grant Funding \n14  86.  Funding for HOPWA grants comes from congressional discretionary appropriations.  See \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  42 U.S.C. § 12912. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  87.  Most recently, Congress appropriated $505,000,000 for the HOPWA program in the 2024 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Appropriations Act.  38 Stat. 358.  The 2024 Appropriations Act contains additional directives to HUD \nN\nN\nRE 18  regarding HOPWA funding.  For instance, it instructs HUD to “renew or replace all expiring contracts \n19  for permanent supportive housing . . . before awarding funds for new contracts.”  Id. \n20  88.  None of the 2024 Appropriations Act’s directives to HUD or any other legislation \n21  authorize HUD to impose HOPWA grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating \n22  enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \n23  “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  \n24  5.  Other HUD Grants \n25  89.  HUD and its program offices administer a range of other competitive and formula grant \n26  programs that some plaintiffs have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to \n27  receive.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on \n28  these other HUD grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of \n    -21-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 22 of 96\n1  immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n2  ideology” or “elective abortion.” \n3  90.  Congress annually appropriates funding for HUD grant programs.  In the annual \n4  appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the Secretary of HUD with \n5  respect to funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \n6  conditions on HUD grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of \n7  immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n8  ideology” or “elective abortion.” See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 \n9  Stat. 1865–1902; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, 136 Stat. 725–766; \n10  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub.

Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Eureka, and County of Sacramento, (collectively the \n13  “HUD Plaintiffs”) have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive HUD \n14  grants, including CDBG grants, ESG grants, HOME grants, HOPWA grants, and/or other HUD grant \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  funding.  These Plaintiffs rely on millions of dollars in appropriated federal funds from HUD grant \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  programs.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  92.  The HUD Plaintiffs rely on HUD block grant programs, including the block programs \nN\nN\nRE 18  described above (CDBG, ESG, HOME, and HOPWA), to provide decent, affordable housing and a \n19  suitable living environment, and to increase economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income \n20  persons throughout their jurisdictions.  The programs that these grants support are extensive and \n21  essential.  These funds are used for programs like the creation and preservation of affordable rental \n22  housing, homeownership rehabilitation and weatherization, food banks, childcare and afterschool \n23  programs, community development capital improvements, home weatherization, and job training \n24  programs.  They help those plaintiffs provide basic needs services, including food distribution, basic \n25  chore assistance for homebound seniors and disabled persons, support for children who have experienced \n26  violence or neglect, and domestic violence prevention for the benefit of low-income individuals and \n27  households.  They also help those plaintiffs provide housing services, including rental assistance, housing \n28  case management, downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and capital development for \n    -22-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 23 of 96\n1  affordable housing to benefit low-income individuals and households and to create affordable housing, \n2  provide rental assistance, and address homelessness in the region.  They help prevent and address \n3  homelessness, including by supporting emergency shelter services.   \n4  B.  DOT Grant Programs \n5  93.  Congress established DOT in 1966 “to assure the coordinated, effective administration of \n6  the transportation programs of the Federal Government.”  Department of 4 Transportation Act, 1966, \n7  Pub. L. 89-670, 80 Stat. 931.  DOT administers both competitive and entitlement (sometimes referred to \n8  as formula) grant programs.  Competitive grant programs “allocate[] a limited pool of funds to state and \n9  local applicants whose applications are approved by” a federal agency.  City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 \n10  F.3d 1163, 1169 (9th Cir. 2019).  In administering grant programs, DOT manages certain grant programs \n11  centrally through the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST).  However, DOT often acts through \n12  its operating administrations, including the FTA, FHWA, FAA, and FRA.  By law, the DOT Secretary is \n13  responsible for all acts taken by its operating administrations.  The administrators of the FTA, FHWA, \n14  FAA, and FRA report directly to the DOT Secretary.  49 U.S.C. § 103(b), (d), (g)(1) (FRA); id. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  §§ 104(b)(1), (c)(1) (FHWA); id. §§ 106(b)(1)(E), (f)(3)(A) (FAA); id. §§ 107(b), (c) (FTA); see also 49 \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  C.F.R. Part 1 (organization and authority of DOT). \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  94.  Congress has established by statute a wide variety of grant programs administered by \nN\nN\nRE 18  DOT centrally through the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (“OST”).  This includes, but is not \n19  limited to, the Innovative Finance and Asset Concession (“IFAC”) Grant Program.  \n20  95.  Section 71001 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act created an asset concession \n21  program.  The Act directs the DOT Secretary to establish a program to facilitate access to expert services \n22  and to provide grants to states, tribes, and local governments to enhance the technical capacity of eligible \n23  entities and facilitate and evaluate public-private partnerships for transportation infrastructure projects, \n24  including through asset concessions.  23 U.S.C. § 611(b).  The Act requires appropriation of $100 million \n25  over five years to fund IFAC grants.  IFAC grants are awarded on a competitive basis.  \n26  96.  Congress must annually authorize $20,000,000 to be made available for IFAC grants until \n27  expended.  23 U.S.C. § 611(g)(2).  In the annual appropriation legislation, Congress sets forth priorities \n28  and directives to the DOT Secretary with respect to transportation funding.

Plaintiff the City of Saint Paul has been awarded an IFAC grant and is currently in the is \n8  in the post-award phase of negotiating with DOT the terms and conditions of the Cooperative Agreement \n9  for the disbursement of funds. Saint Paul is relying on $805,000 in awarded federal funds from DOT to \n10  identify assets that can provide opportunities for public-private partnership and increase the efficiency of \n11  the City’s public transit system.  \n12  1.  FTA Grant Programs  \n13  98.  Congress has established by statute a wide variety of grant programs administered by \n14  DOT, acting through the FTA, that provide federal funds to state and local governments for public transit \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  services.  These include, but are not limited to, programs codified in title 49, chapter 53 of the U.S. Code, \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  as amended by the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act of 2015, Pub. L. 114-94, 129 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Stat. 1312, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429. \nN\nN\nRE 18  99.  For instance, section 5307 authorizes the Secretary of DOT (the “DOT Secretary”) to \n19  make urbanized area formula grants (“UA Formula Grants”), which go toward funding the operating \n20  costs of public transit facilities and equipment in urban areas, as well as certain capital, planning, and \n21  other transit-related projects.  See 49 U.S.C. § 5307(a)(1).  Section 5307 imposes specific requirements \n22  on UA Formula Grant recipients related to the recipient’s operation and control of public transit systems.  \n23  See id. § 5307(c).  None of these requirements pertain to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or facilitating \n24  the enforcement of federal immigration laws.   \n25  100.  Section 5309 establishes certain fixed guideway capital investment grants (“Fixed \n26  Guideway Grants”).  See 49 U.S.C. § 5309(b).  This program funds certain state and local government \n27  projects that develop and improve “fixed guideway” systems—meaning public transit systems that \n28  operate on a fixed right-of-way, such as rail, passenger ferry, or bus rapid transit systems.

Section 5309 imposes specific requirements on Fixed Guideway Grant recipients \n2  related to, for example, the recipient’s capacity to carry out the project, maintain its equipment and \n3  facilities, and achieve budget, cost, and ridership outcomes.  See id. § 5309(c).  None of these \n4  requirements pertain to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or facilitating the enforcement of federal \n5  immigration laws. \n6  101.  Section 5337 authorizes grants to fund state and local government capital projects that \n7  maintain public transit systems in a state of good repair, as well as competitive grants for replacement of \n8  rail rolling stock (“Repair Grants”).  See 49 U.S.C. § 5337(b), (f).  Section 5337 specifically limits what \n9  projects may be eligible for Repair Grants, id. § 5337(b), and imposes specific requirements on multi-\n10  year agreements for competitive rail vehicle replacement grants, id. § 5337(f)(7).  It does not, however, \n11  impose any conditions on Repair Grants related to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or facilitating the \n12  enforcement of federal immigration laws. \n13  102.  Section 5339 authorizes grants to fund the purchase and maintenance of buses and bus \n14  facilities (“Bus Grants”).  See 49 U.S.C. § 5339(a)(2), (b), (c).  The Bus Grant program incorporates the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  specific funding requirements set forth in section 5307 for UA Formula Grants and imposes other \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  requirements on Bus Grant recipients.  See id. § 5339(a)(3), (7), (b)(6), (c)(3).  Section 5339 does not, \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  however, impose any conditions on Bus Grants related to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or local \nN\nN\nRE 18  participation in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. \n19  103.  Congress annually appropriates funding for FTA grant programs, including the programs \n20  identified above.  In the annual appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to \n21  the DOT Secretary with respect to transportation funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever \n22  imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on FTA grants related to a prohibition on all forms of \n23  DEI, facilitating enforcement of immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the \n24  “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n25  2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1182, 1854; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, \n26  136 Stat. 716, 724; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. 117-328, 136 Stat. 5129, 5138; \n27  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118- 42, 138 Stat. 334, 342. \n28  104.  Plaintiffs the City of Fresno and County of Sacramento (collectively, the “FTA \n    -25-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 26 of 96\n1  Plaintiffs”) have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive FTA grants.  \n2  These Plaintiffs rely on over millions of dollars in appropriated federal funds from FTA direct or pass-\n3  through grant programs for transportation-related projects undertaken for the benefit of their \n4  communities. \n5  2.  FHWA Grant Programs  \n6  105.  Congress has established by statute a variety of grant programs administered by DOT, \n7  acting through the FHWA, that provide federal funds to state and local governments for road and street \n8  infrastructure projects.  These include, but are not limited to, programs codified in title 23 of the U.S. \n9  Code and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429. \n10  106.  For instance, Section 24112(b) of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, established \n11  Safe Streets and Roads for All, or SS4A, a competitive grant program that provides funding for \n12  improving roadway safety through the development, refinement, and subsequent implementation of \n13  comprehensive safety action plans.  135 Stat. 815–817.  The Act requires the DOT Secretary to consider, \n14  among other things, the extent to which applicants and their proposed projects will ensure “equitable \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  investment in the safety needs of underserved communities in preventing transportation-related fatalities \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  and injuries” and “achieve[] such other conditions as the Secretary considers to be necessary.”  See id. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  § 24112(c)(3).  None of these considerations pertain to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI or facilitating \nN\nN\nRE 18  the enforcement of federal immigration laws. \n19  107.  In February 2024, DOT posted a Notice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”)—which it \n20  updated in April 2024—announcing a competition for SS4A grant funding for Fiscal Year 2024 (the “FY \n21  2024 SS4A NOFO”).  See U.S. Dep’t of Transp., Notice of Funding Opportunity for FY 2024 Safe \n22  Streets and Roads for All Funding (Apr.  16, 2024), \n23  https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-04/SS4A-NOFO-FY24-Amendment1.pdf.  \n24  108.  The FY 2024 SS4A NOFO directed applicants to consider policy priorities in their \n25  applications, including “Equity and Barriers to Opportunity” and “Climate Change and Environmental \n26  Justice.”  Id. at 39; see also id. at 27, 29 (listing “Equity” as a selection criterion for grants).  The FY \n27  2024 SS4A NOFO specified that “[e]ach applicant selected for SS4A grant funding must demonstrate \n28  effort to improve equity and reduce barriers to opportunity as described in Section A” and stated “the \n    -26-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 27 of 96\n1  Department seeks to award funds under the SS4A grant program that will create proportional impacts to \n2  all populations in a project area, remove transportation related disparities to all populations in a project \n3  area, and increase equitable access to project benefits.”  Id. at 12, 39.  \n4  109.   The FY 2024 SS4A NOFO strongly emphasized equity considerations throughout.  The \n5  NOFO defined “equity” as “[t]he consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all \n6  individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such \n7  treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific \n8  Islanders, and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, \n9  transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and \n10  persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.”  Id. at 4.  The NOFO did not \n11  include any grant conditions related to prohibiting all kinds of DEI or facilitating the enforcement of \n12  federal immigration laws. \n13  110.  In addition to SS4A, FHWA administers the Federal Highway-Aid Program, which \n14  provides federal formula funding for the construction, maintenance and operation of the country’s 3.9-\n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  million-mile highway network, including the Interstate Highway System, primary highways, and \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  secondary local roads. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  111.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorized $356.5 billion for fiscal years 2022 \nN\nN\nRE 18  through 2026 to be used for the Federal Highway-Aid Program.  Currently, there are nine core formula \n19  funding programs within the Federal Highway-Aid Program: the National Highway Performance \n20  Program, 23 U.S.C. § 119; the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (“STBG”), 23 U.S.C. § 133; \n21  the Highway Safety Improvement Program (“HSIP”), 23 U.S.C. § 148 and 23 C.F.R. Part 924; the \n22  Railway-Highway Crossings Program, 23 U.S.C. § 130 and 23 C.F.R. Part 924; the Congestion \n23  Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (“CMAQ”), 23 U.S.C. § 149; the Metropolitan \n24  Planning Program, 23 U.S.C. § 104(d); the National Highway Freight Program, 23 U.S.C. § 167; the \n25  Carbon Reduction Program, 23 U.S.C. § 175; and the PROTECT Formula Program, 23 U.S.C. § 176.  \n26  None of these statutes authorizes DOT or FHWA to impose a prohibition on DEI or a requirement to \n27  facilitate the enforcement of federal immigration laws as a precondition to receiving federal grants.  \n28  112.  Section 11118 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act created the Bridge \n    -27-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 28 of 96\n1  Investment Program (BIP) to assist states, tribes, and local governments with rehabilitating or replacing \n2  bridges to improve safety and efficiency for people and freight moving across bridges.  23 U.S.C. \n3  § 124(b)(2).  The Act directs the DOT Secretary to consider factors such as cost considerations, safety \n4  benefits, and mobility improvements.  Id. §§ 124(f)(3)(B); (g)(4)(B).  No part of the BIP’s authorizing \n5  language describes immigration enforcement or ending DEI as considerations for the grant.  \n6  113.  Section 21203 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act created the National Culvert \n7  Removal, Replacement, and Restoration Grant Program, also known as the Culvert Aquatic Organism \n8  Passage Program (“Culvert AOP Program”) to assist states, tribes, and local governments with projects \n9  that would meaningfully improve or restore passage for anadromous fish (species that are born in \n10  freshwater such as streams and rivers, spend most of their lives in the 19 marine environment, and \n11  migrate back to freshwater to spawn).  49 U.S.C. § 6703.  The Act directs the DOT Secretary to prioritize \n12  projects that would improve fish passage for certain categories of anadromous fish stocks or that would \n13  open more than 200 meters of upstream habitat before the end of the natural habitat.  Id. § 6703(e).  The \n14  FHWA administers some Culvert AOP Program grants on behalf of DOT.  No part of the Culvert AOP \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Program’s authorizing language describes immigration enforcement or ending DEI as considerations for \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  the grant. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  114.  The FHWA also administers the FY 2023-24 Advanced Transportation Technology and \nN\nN\nRE 18  Innovation (ATTAIN) grant program, as directed by Congress in 23 U.S.C. § 503(c)(4).  Section \n19  503(c)(4) directs the DOT Secretary to provide grants “to deploy, install, and operate advanced \n20  transportation technologies to improve safety, mobility, efficiency, system performance, intermodal \n21  connectivity, and infrastructure return on investment.”  The DOT Secretary was directed to develop \n22  selection criteria that included an enumerated list of considerations, including how the deployment of \n23  technology would “improve the mobility of people and goods,” “protect the environment and deliver \n24  environmental benefits that alleviate congestion and streamline traffic flow,” and “reduce the number and \n25  severity of traffic crashes and increase driver, passenger, and pedestrian safety.”  Id.  Nothing in the \n26  statutory provisions authorizing the ATTAIN grant program describes immigration enforcement or \n27  ending DEI as considerations for the grant. \n28  115.  In fulfillment of the statutory authorization of FHWA grant programs, including the ones \n    -28-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 29 of 96\n1  identified above, Congress annually appropriates funding for FHWA grants.  In appropriations \n2  legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the DOT Secretary with respect to \n3  transportation funding, but Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives \n4  for or conditions on FHWA grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement \n5  of immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n6  ideology” or “elective abortion.”  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 19 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, \n7  134 Stat. 1835–1842; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117- 103, 136 Stat. 697–705; \n8  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. 117-328, 136 Stat. 5109– 5117; Consolidated \n9  Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 315–324.  \n10  116.  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Eureka, and County of Sacramento (collectively, the \n11  “FHWA Plaintiffs”) have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive \n12  FHWA grants.  These Plaintiffs rely on millions of dollars in appropriated federal funds from FHWA \n13  direct or pass-through grant programs for transportation-related projects undertaken for the benefit of \n14  their communities. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  3.  FAA Grant Program \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  117.  Congress has established by statute a variety of grant programs administered by DOT, \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  acting through the FAA, that provide federal funds to public agencies for planning and development of \nN\nN\nRE 18  airports.  These include, but are not limited to, programs codified in title 49 of the U.S. Code, as well as \n19  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429.  \n20  118.  For instance, the Airport Improvement Program (“AIP”) is codified under title 49, chapter \n21  471 of the U.S. Code.  Under the AIP, the DOT Secretary is authorized to make formula and \n22  discretionary grants to recipients (referred to as “sponsors”) for the planning and development of certain \n23  public-use airports.  49 U.S.C. 47101 et seq.  The DOT Secretary may approve AIP grant applications \n24  only if the sponsor and project meet certain statutory requirements.  For example, requiring consistency \n25  with plans for development of the surrounding area, financial capacity, and ability to complete the project \n26  “without unreasonable delay,” and only if the sponsor makes certain written assurances based on the type \n27  of grant at issue, such as “the airport will be available for public use on reasonable conditions and \n28  without unjust discrimination” and “the airport and facilities on or connected with the airport will be \n    -29-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 30 of 96\n1  operated and maintained suitably, with consideration given to climatic and flood conditions”.  49 U.S.C. \n2  §§ 47106, 47107. \n3  119.  Congress has been precise in the requirements that attach to grant recipients and has set \n4  those forth in statute, which has been implemented by DOT through contractual “Grant Assurances” that \n5  are terms of every grant agreement.  None of the statutory requirements pertain to a prohibition on DEI \n6  or a requirement of local participation in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. \n7  120.  AIP funding levels are established periodically by reauthorization acts, such as the FAA \n8  Reauthorization Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-254, 132 Stat. 3186, and the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, \n9  Pub. L. 118-63, 138 Stat. 1025.  The reauthorization acts define the AIP authorization levels, amend the \n10  various AIP statutes, and set out directives to the DOT Secretary with respect to airport improvement \n11  funding, but they do not impose or authorize directives for or conditions on AIP grants related to a \n12  prohibition on DEI or requirement of local participation in federal immigration enforcement.   \n13  121.  Similarly, the Airport Infrastructure Grants (“AIG”) program is authorized under the \n14  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 1416–1418.  Under the AIG \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  program, the DOT Secretary is authorized to make formula and discretionary grants for runways, \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  taxiways, airport safety and sustainability projects, as well as terminal, airport transit connections, and \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  roadway projects.  Grants made under the AIG program are treated as having been made pursuant to the \nN\nN\nRE 18  DOT Secretary’s authority for project grants issued under the AIP statute.  135 Stat. 1417–1418.  The \n19  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act sets forth the AIG funding levels but does not impose any \n20  conditions on AIG grants related to prohibitions on DEI or the requirement of local participation in the \n21  enforcement of federal immigration laws.   \n22  122.  In fulfillment of the statutory authorization of FAA grant programs, including the ones \n23  identified above, Congress annually appropriates funding for FAA grants.  In the annual appropriations \n24  legislation, Congress sets forth additional priorities and directives to the DOT Secretary with respect to \n25  transportation funding, but Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing directives for or conditions \n26  on FAA grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of immigration laws, \n27  verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective \n28  abortion.”  See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1830–1835, \n    -30-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 31 of 96\n1  1939–1941; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, 136 Stat. 691–697; Consolidated \n2  Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. 117-328, 136 Stat. 5101–5108; Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n3  2024, Pub. L. 118- 42, 138 Stat. 307–314. \n4  123.  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of South Lake Tahoe, County of Sacramento, County of \n5  Monroe, and Monroe Airport Authority (collectively, the “FAA Plaintiffs”) have previously received, \n6  currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive FAA grants.  These Plaintiffs rely on millions of \n7  dollars in appropriated federal funds from FAA direct or pass-through grant programs for transportation-\n8  related projects undertaken for the benefit of their communities. \n9  4.  Other DOT Grants  \n10  124.  DOT and its operating administrations administer a range of other competitive and \n11  formula grant programs that some Plaintiffs have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise \n12  eligible to receive.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \n13  conditions on these other DOT grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating \n14  enforcement of immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.” \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  125.  Congress annually appropriates funding for DOT grant programs.  In the annual \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the Secretary of DOT with \nN\nN\nRE 18  respect to funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \n19  conditions on HUD grants related to a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of \n20  immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n21  ideology” or “elective abortion.” See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 \n22  Stat. 1182, 1835–1842, 1854; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, 136 Stat. 697–\n23  705, 716, 724; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub.

Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of South Lake Tahoe, City of Eureka, City of Saint Paul, \n26  County of Sacramento, County of Monroe, and Monroe Airport Authority (collectively, the “DOT \n27  Plaintiffs”) have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive DOT grants.  \n28  These Plaintiffs rely on millions of dollars in appropriated federal funds from DOT direct or pass-through \n    -31-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 32 of 96\n1  grant programs for transportation-related projects undertaken for the benefit of their communities. \n2  C.  HHS Grant Programs \n3  127.  Congress established the precursor to HHS—the cabinet-level Department of Health, \n4  Education, and Welfare—in 1953.  After a separate Department of Education was created in 1979, HHS \n5  took its current name.  Today, HHS is the largest grant-making agency in the United States.  It \n6  administers both competitive grant programs and formula and block grant programs that provide funds to \n7  local governments to enhance the health and well-being of their communities.  In administering grant \n8  programs, HHS often acts through its operating divisions and agencies, such as the Centers for Disease \n9  Control and Prevention (“CDC”), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Health \n10  Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n11  Administration (“SAMHSA”), and the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), among others.  See U.S. \n12  Dep’t Health & Hum. Servs., HHS Agencies & Offices, \n13  https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/hhsagencies-and-offices/index.html (last visited June 27, 2025).  \n14  The Secretary of HHS is responsible for overseeing the actions of its operating divisions and agencies.  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 290aa (similar for SAMHSA and its head; authority of HHS Secretary); 42 U.S.C. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  § 242c (appointment and authority of CDC Director; functions of HHS Secretary); 42 U.S.C. § 282 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  (appointment and authority of NIH Director; functions of HHS Secretary); 42 U.S.C. §§ 202–203 \nN\nN\nRE 18  (organization of Public Health Service, which includes NIH, within HHS); 42 U.S.C. § 1317 \n19  (appointment of CMS Administrator); U.S. Dep’t Health & Hum. Servs., Centers for Medicare & \n20  Medicaid Services, 66 Fed. Reg. 35437 (Jul. 5, 2001) (establishing CMS and delegating authority from \n21  HHS Secretary to CMS Administrator).  Some examples of the grants administered by HHS and its \n22  operating divisions and agencies are discussed below. \n23  1.  Health Resources and Services Administration Programs  \n24  128.  The Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) within HHS awards grant \n25  funding to more than 3,000 recipients, including state and local governments, to support health services \n26  projects, such as training health care workers and providing specific health services.  Elayne J. Heisler, \n27  Cong. Rsch. Serv., R46001, HRSA FY2020 President’s Budget Request and Agency Funding History: In \n28  Brief (Nov. 12, 2019).  \n    -32-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 33 of 96\n1  129.  HRSA awards a variety of competitive and formula grants in several program areas, \n2  including Primary Care/Health Centers, Health Workforce Training, HIV/AIDS, Organ Donation, \n3  Maternal and Child Health, Rural Health, and other areas.  Grants, U.S. Dep’t Health & Hum. Servs., \n4  Health Res. & Servs. Admin., https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/grants (last updated May 20, 2025). \n5  130.  Among HRSA’s largest grant programs are the Health Center Program (HCP) and the \n6  Ryan White HIV/AIDS (RWHA) program. \n7  a.  The Health Center Program \n8  131.   Congress authorized the federal HCP program through Section 330 of the Public Health \n9  Service Act (PHSA), as amended.  42 U.S.C. § 254b.  The HCP program funds grants to support \n10  qualified outpatient facilities that provide primary care to low-income individuals and other underserved \n11  communities, as specified in the statute. \n12  132.  In particular, the HCP program supports four types of health centers: (1) community \n13  health centers (“CHCs”), (2) health centers for the homeless (“HCHs”), (3) health centers for residents of \n14  public housing, and (4) migrant health centers.  See 42 U.S.C. §254b(a), (g), (h), (i).  The majority of \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  these are CHCs, which must provide “primary health services” to medically underserved populations and \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  serve all residents of the CHC’s services area.  Id. § 2549(a).  HCHs provide services to individuals \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  experiencing or at risk of homelessness and are required to provide all services CHCs provide as well as \nN\nN\nRE 18  substance abuse treatment.  Id. § 2549(h).  Health centers for residents of public housing are located in, \n19  and offer primary care services to those who reside in or near, public housing facilities.  Id. § 2549(i).  \n20  Finally, migrant health centers provide care to migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their \n21  families.  Id. § 2549(g). \n22  133.  Funding for the HCP program comes from a combination of discretionary funding, \n23  appropriated by Congress each year, and mandatory funding from the Community Health Center Fund.  \n24  By statue, HCH programs receive 8.7% of HCP funds. \n25  134.  In addition to the HCP grants themselves, health centers that receive funding under \n26  Section 330 of the PHSA become eligible for other congressionally authorized benefits.  For instance, \n27  such health centers are eligible for designation as Federally Qualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”), which \n28  entitles them to higher, cost-based Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.  42 U.S.C. §§ \n    -33-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 34 of 96\n1  1395i(a)(1)(z), 1395m(o), 1395x(aa)(3).  FQHCs may also receive drug discounts under Section 340B of \n2  the PHSA.  Id. § 256b.  \n3  135.  Section 330 of the PHSA sets out numerous requirements that health centers must meet to \n4  ensure that HCP-funded facilities serve as part of a safety net for underserved communities.  In addition \n5  to the requirements set forth above, Congress requires that HCP-funded health centers provide services to \n6  all patients regardless of ability to pay.  42 U.S.C. § 254b(k)(3).  Recipients must therefore have fee \n7  schedules consistent with locally prevailing wages while covering operating costs, and must offer \n8  discounts based on the patient’s ability to pay.  Id. § 254b(k)(3)(G).  They must also be located in areas \n9  or serve populations that the HHS Secretary has designated as “medically underserved.”  Id. § \n10  254b(a)(1), (b)(3), (c)(1), (e)(1)(A).  The statute sets forth additional detailed funding conditions \n11  concerning Medicaid coordination and reimbursement, governance, provision of services, reporting, and \n12  quality assurance.  Id. § 254b(b)(1), (k)(3)(C), (F), (H), (I), (q). \n13  136.  Section 330 of the PHSA does not authorize conditions on HCP grants related to \n14  prohibiting DEI in all forms, excluding transgender individuals, denying services to immigrants, or \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  incorporating executive orders unrelated to providing health care to underserved populations. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  137.  The HHS Secretary has promulgated regulations further governing the HCP program at 42 \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  C.F.R. parts 51c and 56 (the “HCP Rule”).  Among other things, the HCP Rule sets forth additional \nN\nN\nRE 18  limitations on the use of HCP funds, 42 C.F.R. § 51c.107, and enumerates project requirements and \n19  criteria the HHS Secretary will consider in awarding grants based on the purpose of the funds, id. §§ \n20  51c.203, 51c.204, 51c.303, 51c.305, 51c.403, 51c.404., 51c.504.  For instance, in reviewing proposals to \n21  plan or develop new health centers, the HHS Secretary must consider the relative need of the population \n22  to be served by the proposed project, the health center’s potential for developing new and effective \n23  methods for providing services, and the distribution of resources across the country.  Id. § 51c.204.  The \n24  HCP Rule also sets forth specific requirements for migrant health centers, including a requirement that \n25  they provide specific services to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers’ needs, such as supportive \n26  services, environmental health services, accident prevention, and prevention and treatment of health \n27  conditions related to pesticide exposure.  42 C.F.R. § 56.102(g). \n28  138.  The HCP Rule does not impose any conditions on HCP grants related to prohibiting DEI \n    -34-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 35 of 96\n1  in all forms, excluding transgender individuals, or incorporating executive orders unrelated to providing \n2  health care to underserved populations. \n3  b.  Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program  \n4  139.  In 1990, Congress established the Ryan White HIV/AIDS (RWHA) program as part of the \n5  Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act, Pub. L. 101-381, 104 Stat. 576, and has \n6  revised and extended it several times, including in the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization \n7  Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109-415, 120 Stat. 2767, and the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act \n8  of 2009, Pub. L. 111-87, 123 Stat. 2885.  The program is codified at Title 42, Subchapter XXIV of the \n9  U.S. Code and contains four major parts.  Among these are Part A, which provides grants to urban areas \n10  and mid-sized cities, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300ff-11 to 300ff-20; Part B, which provides grants to states and \n11  territories, id. §§ 300ff-21 to 300ff-38; and Part C, which funds HIV outpatient primary care to low-\n12  income and medically underserved people living with HIV/AIDS, id. §§ 300ff–51 to 300ff–67. \n13  i.  RWHA Part A Program \n14  140.  Part A of the RWHA program provides grants for medical and support services to eligible \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  metropolitan areas with high levels of reported AIDS cases in the previous five years.  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-\nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  11(a).  HRSA distributes two-thirds of appropriated Part A grants non-competitively to eligible \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  metropolitan areas based on a statutory formula, id. § 300ff-13(a)(2)–(3), and the remaining one-third via \nN\nN\nRE 18  competitive supplemental grants awarded based on the applicant’s demonstrated need, id. § 300ff-13(b).  \n19  With respect to the two-thirds comprised of formula grants, the Secretary has no discretion to withhold \n20  funding and is required to allocate grants based on a formula that considers how many individuals are \n21  living with HIV/AIDS in the jurisdiction.  See id. § 300ff-13(a)(2), (3). \n22  141.  Congress has imposed detailed conditions on RWHA Part A grants. For instance, Part A \n23  grant recipients must spend 75% of awarded funds on “core medical services,” which are defined to \n24  include outpatient/ambulatory medical care services, AIDS pharmaceutical assistance, home health care, \n25  and mental health and substance abuse outpatient services, among others.  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-14(c).  The \n26  remaining Part A funds must go toward “support services,” such as outreach, medical transportation, and \n27  referrals, as well as statutorily permitted administrative expenses.  Id. § 300ff-14(c)(1), (d).  Congress has \n28  also mandated that grant recipients establish HIV Health Services Planning Councils to set priorities for \n    -35-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 36 of 96\n1  care delivery and has prescribed several related requirements.  Id. § 300ff-12(b). \n2  142.  Congress has also enacted statutory factors that HRSA must consider in awarding \n3  competitive supplemental grants to applicants based on demonstrated need.  These include the rates of \n4  HIV/AIDS, impacts of co-morbid factors, and prevalence of homelessness in the applicant’s area.  42 \n5  U.S.C. § 300ff-13(b)(2)(B). \n6  143.  Neither the statutes governing the RWHA Part A program nor any other legislation \n7  authorizes HRSA to impose grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, exclusion of \n8  transgender individuals, denying services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to \n9  providing health services for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS. \n10  ii.  RWHA Part B Program \n11  144.  The RWHA Part B program provides grants to each of the 50 states, the District of \n12  Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands for services such as drug treatments, home and community-\n13  based health care, support services, or health insurance coverage for low income individuals living with \n14  HIV/AIDS, among other services.  42 U.S.C. §§ 30ff-22–26. Some of these states and territories pass \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  through RWHA Part B funds to subrecipients, including local governments.  One portion of RWHA Part \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  B is the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (“ADAP”), which receives separate appropriations from \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Congress.  Id. § 300ff-26.  The remaining funding goes toward Part B base grants and supplemental \nN\nN\nRE 18  grants.  Base grants are awarded pursuant to a formula based on the number of individuals living with \n19  HIV/AIDS cases in the state or territory relative to various comparators.  Id. § 300ff-28.  Supplemental \n20  grants under RWHA Part B are awarded to states and territories with a demonstrated need based on \n21  increasing rates of HIV/AIDS cases, unmet needs for services, and other factors.  Id. § 300ff-29a. \n22  145.  Congress has imposed detailed conditions on RWHA Part B grants.  For instance, as in \n23  the Part A program, recipients of Part B funds must spend 75% of awarded funds on “core medical \n24  services” and 25% on “support services,” which are each limited to specifically defined activities.  42 \n25  U.S.C. § 300ff-22.  The Part B program also authorizes states and territories to award grants to \n26  subrecipients and imposes additional requirements on such sub-awards based on the type of services the \n27  subrecipient will provide.  See id. §§ 300ff-23–24.  For example, Congress has authorized states and \n28  territories to award grants for home- and community-based health services, but requires states and \n    -36-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 37 of 96\n1  territories to prioritize providers who serve low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS and participate in an \n2  HIV care consortium.  Id. § 300ff-24(b). \n3  146.  The statute authorizes the Secretary of HHS to require other “agreements, assurances, and \n4  information” from states and territories, but only to the extent “necessary to carry out” the Secretary’s \n5  authority to “make grants to . . . enable . . . States to improve the quality, availability and organization of \n6  health care and support services for individuals and families with HIV/AIDS.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 300ff-27(a), \n7  300ff-21. \n8  147.  Congress has also authorized states and territories to award grants using RWHA Part B \n9  funds to certain associations, called HIV care consortia, comprised of public or private service providers \n10  and community-based organizations in areas most affected by HIV/AIDS.  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-23.  In \n11  doing so, Congress set forth specific agreements and assurances related to the purposes of the Part B \n12  program that HIV care consortia must make as a condition to receiving funds.  For instance, HIV care \n13  consortia must “agree to use such assistance for the planning, development and delivery . . . of \n14  comprehensive outpatient health and support services for individuals with HIV/AIDS.”  Id. § 300ff-\n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  23(a)(2).  \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  148.  The assurances and application requirements Congress specified for HIV care consortia \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  under RWHA Part B indicate a statutory purpose to address the needs of minority and underserved \nN\nN\nRE 18  communities.  For instance, each HIV care consortium must provide an assurance that “the populations \n19  and subpopulations of individuals and families with HIV/AIDS have been identified by the consortium, \n20  particularly those experiencing disparities in access and services and those who reside in historically \n21  underserved communities.” Id. § 300ff-23(b)(1)(A).  The consortium must also provide an assurance that \n22  it has established a service plan that “addresses the special care and service needs of” such historically \n23  underserved communities.  Id. § 300ff-23(b)(1)(B).  Finally, Congress specified grant application \n24  requirements that HIV care consortia must meet to be eligible for funding, including that the application \n25  “demonstrates that adequate planning occurred to address disparities in access and services and \n26  historically underserved communities.” Id. § 300ff-23(c)(1)(F). \n27  149.  Neither the statutes governing the RWHA Part B program nor any other legislation \n28  authorizes HRSA to impose grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, exclusion of \n    -37-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 38 of 96\n1  transgender individuals, denying services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to \n2  providing health services for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS. \n3  iii.  RWHA Part C Program \n4  150.  RWHA Part C grants emphasize services designed to intervene early to improve health \n5  outcomes for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS.  HRSA awards RWHA Part C grants \n6  competitively to eligible facilities, including municipal health facilities, that serve medically underserved \n7  populations.  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-52(a).  Congress has mandated that HRSA prioritize applicants \n8  experiencing increased burdens on HIV/AIDS services when awarding RWHA Part C grants.  Id. § \n9  300ff-53. \n10  151.  Like Part A and Part B grants, Part C grants are subject to specific statutory requirements.  \n11  For instance, Part C grant recipients must also provide a mix of statutorily prescribed “core services” and \n12  “supportive serves.”  42 U.S.C. § 300ff-51(b)(1).  At least half of allocated funding must go toward such \n13  services that focus on early intervention, including HIV/AIDS testing and referrals.  Id. § 300ff-51(b)(2).  \n14  The statute also requires applicants to agree to certain funding conditions, including that the applicant \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  will only use funds for statutorily authorized purposes, will establish fiscal control and accounting \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  procedures, and will establish a clinical quality management program, among others.  Id. § 300ff-64(g).  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Finally, Congress has mandated conditions on the use of funds for HIV/AIDS counseling, including that \nN\nN\nRE 18  counseling programs may not directly promote intravenous drug use or sexual activity and must educate \n19  patients on the availability of hepatitis a and b vaccines.  Id. § 300ff-67. \n20  152.  Neither the statutes governing the RWHA Part C program nor any other legislation \n21  authorizes HRSA to impose grant conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, exclusion of \n22  transgender individuals, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to providing early intervention \n23  services for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS. \n24  2.  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Programs  \n25  153.  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within \n26  HHS, “funds organizations providing substance use and mental health services, research, technical \n27  assistance, and training to advance the behavioral health and to improve the lives of individuals living \n28  with mental and substance use disorders, and their families.”  Grants, SAMHSA, \n    -38-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 39 of 96\n1  https://www.samhsa.gov/grants (last visited July 1, 2025).  SAMHSA administers both competitive, \n2  discretionary grant programs and “noncompetitive, formula grant” programs “mandated by the U.S. \n3  Congress.”  Id.  Examples of these noncompetitive block grants include the Community Mental Health \n4  Services Block Grant and the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant. \n5  154.  SAMHSA’s authority to issue grants under its various programs is conferred by statute.  \n6  See, eg., 42 U.S.C. §§ 290dd-3 (Grants for reducing overdose deaths), 290dd-4 (Program to support \n7  coordination and continuation of care for drug overdose patients), 290ee (Opioid overdose reversal \n8  medication access, education, and co-prescribing grant programs), 290ee-1 (First responder training), \n9  290ee-2 (Building communities of recovery), 290ee-3 (State demonstration grants for comprehensive \n10  opioid abuse response), 290ee-3a  (Grant program for State and Tribal response to opioid use disorders), \n11  290ee-5a (Sobriety treatment and recovery teams), 290ee-9 (Services for families and patients in crisis).  \n12  These statutes list the required criteria for a grant application and allowable uses for grant funds.  None \n13  of the statutes establishing these programs authorize conditions on these grants related to prohibiting all \n14  forms of DEI, exclusion of transgender individuals, denying services to immigrants, or adherence to \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  155.  One of the requirements provided in SAMHSA’s Notices of Award (NOA) is a “Disparity \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Impact Statement (DIS),” which includes “[a] quality improvement plan for how [recipients will use \nN\nN\nRE 18  program data] to monitor and manage program outcomes by race, ethnicity, and LGBT status, when \n19  possible.”  SAMHSA also required the quality improvement plan to “include strategies for how processes \n20  and/or programmatic adjustments will support efforts to reduce disparities for the identified sub-\n21  populations.”  The NOAs do not include any grant conditions related to prohibiting all kinds of DEI, \n22  exclusion of transgender people, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to overdose response.  \n23  3.  Center for Disease Control and Prevention Grant Programs   \n24  156.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within HHS describes itself as \n25  “the nation’s leading science-based, data-driven, service organization that protects the public’s health.” \n26  Home, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/ (last accessed June 30, 2025).  CDC provides much of the funding to \n27  support public health systems and activities by state and local governments.  Josh Michaud, et al., CDC’s \n28  Funding for State and Local Public Health: How Much and Where Does it Go?, KFF, \n    -39-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 40 of 96\n1  https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/cdcs-funding-for-state-and-local-publichealth-how-much-and-\n2  where-does-it-go/ (Apr. 7, 2025).  In FY 2023, CDC obligated almost $15 billion to state and local \n3  jurisdictions.  Id.  The CDC’s funding supports a range of programs including HIV/AIDS, Viral \n4  Hepatitis, STI, and TB Prevention; Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; Public Health \n5  Preparedness and Response; and Injury Prevention and Control.  Grant Funding Profiles – Funding \n6  Category View, CDC, https://fundingprofiles.cdc.gov/Category/Category (last visited June 30, 2025). \n7  157.  For example, one of the grants awarded by CDC is the High-Impact HIV Prevention and \n8  Surveillance Programs for Health Departments grant, which is a part of CDC’s funding for HIV/AIDS, \n9  Viral Hepatitis, STI, and TB Prevention. As explained by the most recent 2024 NOFO for this program, \n10  the grant funds recipients “to implement a comprehensive, person-centered HIV prevention and \n11  surveillance program to prevent new HIV infections and improve the health of people with HIV.” \n12  158.  The NOFO for this program includes as a required element, “Addressing Social and \n13  Structural Factors.”  The NOFO recognizes that “[t]he impact of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and \n14  stigma significantly exacerbates the health disparities experienced among communities \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  disproportionately affected by HIV.  Health equity is a desirable goal that entails special efforts to \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  improve the health of those who have experienced social or economic disadvantage.”  With respect to the \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  “Population(s) of Focus,” the NOFO explains that “Applicants must provide HIV services to populations \nN\nN\nRE 18  within the jurisdiction that are disproportionately impacted by HIV as identified by their epidemiological \n19  data, gaps in services, or need,” and “Examples to consider based on national and local data, include \n20  transgender women, cisgender Black or African American women, gay and bisexual men, American \n21  Indian or Alaska Native gay and bisexual men, people who inject drugs (PWID), youth, pregnant and \n22  postpartum persons and their infants, and other populations with disproportionately higher rates of HIV \n23  diagnosis including individuals involved in the justice system and people experiencing housing \n24  insecurity.” \n25  159.  The NOFO did not include any grant conditions related to prohibiting all kinds of DEI, \n26  exclusion of transgender people, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to HIV/AIDS surveillance \n27  and prevention. \n28  160.  Statutory authority for the Fiscal Year 2024 High-Impact HIV Prevention and \n    -40-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 41 of 96\n1  Surveillance Programs for Health Departments grant comes from 42 U.S.C. § 247c(b)–(c) and the \n2  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, Pub. L. 114-113, 129 Stat. 2242. 42 U.S.C. § 247c authorizes \n3  HHS to make grants like the High-Impact HIV Prevention and Surveillance Programs for Health \n4  Departments grant.  It also identifies authorized conditions on the grants, including recordkeeping \n5  requirements, 42 U.S.C. § 247c(e)(3), and patient confidentiality mandates, id. § 247c(e)(5).  Neither 42 \n6  U.S.C. § 247c nor the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 authorizes or impose conditions on this \n7  grant related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, exclusion of transgender individuals, denying services to \n8  immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to HIV/AIDS surveillance and prevention.  \n9  4.  Other HHS Grants \n10  161.  HHS and its operating divisions and agencies administer a range of other grant programs \n11  that some plaintiffs have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive.  \n12  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on these \n13  other HHS grants related to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI, exclusion of transgender people, denying \n14  services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  162.  Congress annually appropriates funding for HHS grant programs.  In the annual \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the Secretary of HHS with \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  respect to funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \nN\nN\nRE 18  conditions on HHS grants related to a prohibition on DEI, exclusion of transgender people, denying \n19  services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant.  See, e.g., \n20  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1523–28, 1567–98; Consolidated \n21  Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub.

EPA Grant Programs  \n2  164.  Congress established the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) in 1970 through \n3  Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, 35 Fed. Reg. 15623 (Oct. 6, 1970), which consolidated many \n4  environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency.  Every year, EPA awards \n5  more than $4 billion in funding for grants and other assistance agreements to state and local \n6  governments, tribes, universities, nonprofit recipients, and other entities to protect human health and the \n7  environment.  See U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, EPA Grants Overview for Applicants and Recipients, \n8  https://www.epa.gov/grants/epa-grants-overview-applicants-and-recipients.  The EPA Administrator is \n9  responsible for overseeing all agency programs and offices, supervising the administration of grants and \n10  other funding, and ensuring the agency’s actions comply with statutory and executive requirements.  See, \n11  e.g.,  42 U.S. Code §§ 6912; 9628; 13103(a).   \n12  1.  Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program \n13  165.  The EPA’s Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program provides funds to states, Tribal \n14  Nations, communities, and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up, and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  sustainably reuse contaminated or potentially contaminated properties, commonly referred to as \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  “brownfields.”  See U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, EPA Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund Grants Program \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Overview, https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-08/Program%20Overview_RLF.pdf.  \nN\nN\nRE 18  Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) Grants provide funding to a grant recipient for capitalizing an RLF \n19  program.  RLF programs provide loans and subgrants to eligible entities to carry out cleanup activities at \n20  brownfield sites contaminated with hazardous substances.   \n21  2.  Congress Authorized the Establishment of Brownfields and Land \n22  Revitalization Grants \n23  166.  Congress authorized the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program through the Small \n24  Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-118, 115 Stat. \n25  2356 (2002).  This statute amended section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n26  Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and established EPA’s Brownfields Program in its current \n27  form.  Congress authorized the EPA to award assessment grants, cleanup grants, revolving loan fund \n28  (“RLF”) grants, and job training grants. See 42 U.S.C. § 9604(k)(2)–(6).  The RLF program, set forth in \n    -42-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 43 of 96\n1  42 U.S.C. § 9604(k)(3), enables eligible entities to establish loan funds that can be used to finance \n2  cleanup activities at brownfield sites.   \n3  3.  Congress Imposes Legislative Directives, and EPA Promulgates Rules \n4  Regarding the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program  \n5  167.  EPA’s administration of the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program, including the \n6  award of RLF grants, is authorized and governed by statutory directives.  Congress has specified what \n7  activities are eligible for funding under the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program, the \n8  responsibilities of grant recipients, and specific certifications that grant recipients must agree to as a \n9  condition of receiving funds.  For example, assessment grants may only be used for inventorying, \n10  characterizing, assessing, and conducting planning activities related to brownfield sites.  42 U.S.C. § \n11  9604(k)(2).  RLF grants must be used either to capitalize revolving loan funds or, in certain cases, \n12  directly for remediation at sites owned by the grantee or an eligible nonprofit.  Id. § 9604(k)(3).  \n13  Congress also imposed clear prohibitions on the use of funds.  No grant or loan may be used to pay \n14  penalties or fines, to satisfy a federal cost-share requirement, to pay cleanup costs at a site where the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  recipient is a potentially responsible party under CERCLA § 107, or to cover compliance costs under \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  other federal environmental laws (except those associated with cleanup).  Id. § 9604(k)(5)(B). \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  168.  Additionally, every grant or loan agreement must require the recipient to comply with all \nN\nN\nRE 18  applicable federal and state laws and provide a 20 percent non-federal matching share in cash or in-kind \n19  contributions, unless EPA determines that such a match would cause undue hardship.  42 U.S.C. § \n20  9604(k)(10)(B).  Congress further directed EPA to weigh community involvement and equity \n21  considerations in awarding grants.  The ranking criteria established by statute requires consideration of \n22  the extent to which projects provide for meaningful local community participation in cleanup and reuse \n23  decisions, and “the extent to which a grant would address or facilitate the identification and reduction of \n24  threats to the health or welfare of children, pregnant women, minority or low-income communities, or \n25  other sensitive populations.”  Id. § 9604(k)(6)(C)(x). \n26  169.  The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 does not \n27  authorize EPA to condition funding on prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \n28  immigration laws, certifying certain facts are material for the purposes of the False Claims Act, or \n    -43-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 44 of 96\n1  prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  Funding for the Brownfields \n2  and Land Revitalization Program comes from congressional appropriations.  Most recently, Congress \n3  appropriated funds for the Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program in the Consolidated \n4  Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 252–263.  Nothing in the 2024 Appropriations Act \n5  or any other legislation authorizes EPA to impose grant fund conditions related to prohibiting all forms \n6  of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, certifying certain facts are material for the \n7  purposes of the False Claims Act, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective \n8  abortion.”   \n9  4.  Other EPA Grants \n10  170.  EPA and its operating divisions and agencies administer a range of other grant programs \n11  that some plaintiffs have previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive.  \n12  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or conditions on these \n13  other EPA grants related to a prohibition on all kinds of DEI, exclusion of transgender people, denying \n14  services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  171.  Congress annually appropriates funding for EPA grant programs.  In the annual \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  appropriations legislation, Congress sets forth priorities and directives to the Administrator of EPA with \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  respect to funding.  Plaintiffs are not aware of Congress ever imposing or authorizing directives for or \nN\nN\nRE 18  conditions on EPA grants related to a prohibition on DEI, exclusion of transgender people, denying \n19  services to immigrants, or adherence to executive orders unrelated to the purpose of the grant.  See, e.g., \n20  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1507–1516; Consolidated \n21  Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. 117-103, 136 Stat. 380–389; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, \n22  Pub. L. 117-328, 136 Stat. 4790–4800; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. \n23  252–263. \n24  172.  Plaintiff, City of Fresno, has previously received, currently receives, or is otherwise \n25  eligible to receive EPA grants.  Fresno relies on millions of dollars in appropriated federal funds from \n26  EPA’s direct or pass-through grant programs for environmental projects undertaken for the benefit of its \n27  communities. \n28   \n    -44-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 45 of 96\n1  E.  Following President Trump’s Inauguration, Defendants Unilaterally Impose New \n2  Conditions on Federal Grants. \n3  1.  President Trump Issues Executive Orders Directing Federal Agencies to \n4  Impose New Conditions on Federal Grants  \n5  173.  Since taking office, President Trump has issued numerous executive orders directing the \n6  heads of executive agencies to impose conditions on federal funding that bear little or no connection to \n7  the purposes of the grant programs Congress established, lack statutory authorization, conflict with the \n8  law as interpreted by the courts, and are even at odds with the purposes of the grants they purport to \n9  amend.  Instead, the conditions appear to require federal grant recipients to agree to promote the political \n10  agenda President Trump campaigned on during his run for office and has continued espousing since, \n11  including prohibiting all kinds of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification \n12  of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  \n13  Plaintiffs cannot comply with Defendants’ vague, ambiguous, and unauthorized conditions without \n14  exposing themselves to substantial legal liability or forgo critical federal funding.   \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  174.  The “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” executive \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  order directs each federal agency head to include “in every contract or grant award” a term that the \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  contractor or grant recipient “certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI” that would \nN\nN\nRE 18  violate federal antidiscrimination laws.  Exec. Order 14173 § 3(b)(iv)(B), 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, \n19  2025) (the “DEI Order”).  The certification is not limited to programs funded with federal grants.  Id. \n20  § 3(b)(iv).   \n21  175.  The DEI Order also directs each agency head to include a term requiring the contractor or \n22  grant recipient to agree that its compliance “in all respects” with all applicable federal nondiscrimination \n23  laws is “material to the government’s payment decisions” for purposes of the False Claims Act (FCA), \n24  31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et seq. Id. § 3(b)(iv)(A).  The FCA imposes liability on “any person” who “knowingly \n25  presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.”  31 U.S.C. \n26  § 3729(a)(1)(A).  For FCA liability to attach, the alleged misrepresentation must be “material to the \n27  Government’s payment decision”—an element the U.S. Supreme Court has called “demanding.” \n28  Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176, 192, 194 (2016).  Each \n    -45-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 46 of 96\n1  violation of the FCA is punishable by a civil penalty of up to $27,894, plus mandatory treble damages \n2  sustained by the federal government because of that violation.  31 U.S.C. § 3729(a); 28 C.F.R. § 85.5(a).  \n3  Given the demands of proving materiality and the severity of penalties imposed by the FCA, the \n4  certification term represents another effort to coerce compliance with the President’s policies by \n5  effectively forcing grant recipients to concede an essential element of an FCA claim. \n6  176.  The DEI Order does not define the term “DEI.”  As explained below, subsequent \n7  executive agency memoranda and letters make clear that the Trump Administration’s conception of what \n8  federal antidiscrimination law requires, including what constitutes a purportedly “illegal” DEI program, \n9  is inconsistent with the requirements of federal nondiscrimination statutes as interpreted by the courts. \n10  177.  The “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” executive order directs all agency \n11  heads to ensure “that Federal payments to States and localities do not, by design or effect, facilitate the \n12  subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to \n13  shield illegal aliens from deportation.”  Executive Order 14218 § 2(ii), 90 Fed. Reg. 10581 (Feb. 19, \n14  2025) (the “Immigration Order”). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  178.  The Immigration Order also purports to implement the Personal Responsibility and Work \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Opportunity Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”), pursuant to which certain federal benefits are limited to \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  individuals with qualifying immigration status.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1611(a).  In particular, the Immigration \nN\nN\nRE 18  Order directs all agency heads to “identify all federally funded programs administered by the agency that \n19  currently permit illegal aliens to obtain any cash or non-cash public benefit” and “take all appropriate \n20  actions to align such programs with the purposes of this order and the requirements of applicable Federal \n21  law, including … PRWORA.”  Id. § 2(i).  \n22  179.  On April 28, 2025, President Trump issued additional executive orders related to \n23  immigration and law enforcement.  The “Protecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens” \n24  executive order states that “some State and local officials … continue to use their authority to violate, \n25  obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” and directs the Attorney General in \n26  coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify “sanctuary jurisdictions,” take steps to \n27  withhold federal funding from such places, and develop “mechanisms to ensure appropriate eligibility \n28  verification is conducted for individuals receiving Federal public benefits … from private entities in a \n    -46-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 47 of 96\n1  sanctuary jurisdiction, whether such verification is conducted by the private entity or by a governmental \n2  entity on its behalf.”  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/protecting-american-\n3  communities-from-criminal-aliens/.  The “Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to \n4  Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens” executive order directs the Attorney General to, among \n5  other things, “prioritize prosecution of any applicable violations of Federal criminal law with respect to \n6  State and local jurisdictions” whose officials “willfully and unlawfully direct the obstruction of criminal \n7  law, including by directly and unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement officers from carrying out duties \n8  necessary for public safety and law enforcement” or “unlawfully engage in discrimination or civil-rights \n9  violations under the guise of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives that restrict law enforcement \n10  activity or endanger citizens.”  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-\n11  and-unleashing-americas-law-enforcement-to-pursue-criminals-and-protect-innocent-citizens/.  \n12  180.  The “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological \n13  Truth to the Federal Government” executive order directs agency heads to “take all necessary steps, as \n14  permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology” and “assess grant conditions and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  grantee preferences” to “ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.”  Exec. Order No. 14168 \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  § 3(e), (g), 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 20, 2025) (the “Gender Ideology Order”).  The Gender Ideology \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Order states that “‘[g]ender ideology’ replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting \nN\nN\nRE 18  concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus \n19  become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.”  \n20  Id. § 2(f).  It goes on to state that “[g]ender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of \n21  genders that are disconnected from one’s sex” and is therefore “internally inconsistent, in that it \n22  diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a \n23  person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”  Id. \n24  181.  The “Enforcing the Hyde Amendment” executive order declares it the policy of the United \n25  States “to end the forced use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion.”  Exec. \n26  Order No. 14182, 90 Fed. Reg. 8751 (Jan. 24, 2025) (the “Abortion Order”).  The Acting Director of the \n27  U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum to the heads of the executive \n28  agencies providing guidance on how agencies should implement the Abortion Order.  Memorandum \n    -47-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 48 of 96\n1  from Acting Director of OMB Matthew J. Vaeth to Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies (Jan.  \n2  24,  2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/M-25-12-Memorandum-on-Hyde-\n3  Amendment-EO.pdf (the “OMB Memo”).  The OMB Memo told agency heads that the Trump \n4  Administration’s policy is “not to use taxpayer funds to fund, facilitate, or promote abortion, including \n5  travel or transportation to obtain an abortion, consistent with the Hyde Amendment and other statutory \n6  restrictions on taxpayer funding for abortion.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The OMB Memo further instructed \n7  agency heads to “reevaluate” policies and other actions to conform with the Abortion Funding Order, \n8  audit federally funded activities suspected to contravene the Abortion Funding Order, and submit a \n9  monthly report to OMB on each agency’s progress in implementing the OMB Memo.  Id. \n10  182.  On August 7, 2025 President Trump issued another executive order titled, Improving \n11  Oversight of Federal Grantmaking that requires that discretionary grant awards “demonstrably advance \n12  the President’s policy priorities” and “shall not be used to fund, promote, encourage, subsidize, or \n13  facilitate” “racial preferences or other forms of racial discrimination by the grant recipient,” “denial by \n14  the grant recipient of the sex binary in humans or the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  characteristic,” or “any other initiatives that compromise public safety or promote anti-American values.”  \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Exec. Order No. 14332, 90 Fed. Reg. 38929 (Aug. 7, 2025) (the “Grantmaking Oversight Order”). \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  2.  HUD Attaches New Conditions to HUD Grants \nN\nN\nRE 18  183.  Since President Trump’s issuance of the executive orders described above and Defendant \n19  Turner’s confirmation as HUD Secretary, HUD has implemented President Trump’s Executive Orders by \n20  attaching new and unlawful conditions (collectively, the “HUD Grant Conditions”) across the expansive \n21  portfolio of HUD grants established by Congress; demanding grant recipients’ agreement to those new \n22  conditions and issuing agency-wide letters and statements about how HUD will enforce those conditions. \n23  a.  HUD issues new policy terms for all financial assistance incorporating \n24  the unlawful conditions \n25  184.  In or around April 2025, HUD amended its General Administrative, National, and \n26  Departmental Policy Requirements and Terms for HUD’s Financial Assistance Programs (the “HUD \n27  Policy Terms”), which set forth “various laws and policies that may apply to recipients of” HUD grant \n28  awards.  This document is posted on HUD’s website at \n    -48-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 49 of 96\n1  https://www.hud.gov/sites/default/files/CFO/documents/Administrative-Requirements-Addendum-\n2  FY2025.pdf.  Among such potentially applicable policies, the document lists several of President \n3  Trump’s executive orders as well as language implementing those orders.  \n4  185.  For example, in a section labelled “Compliance with Immigration Requirements,” the \n5  HUD Policy Terms list the Immigration Order and summarize the potentially applicable policy: \n6  No state or unit of general local government that receives HUD funding \nunder may use that funding in a manner that by design or effect facilitates \n7  the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration or abets policies that \nseek to shield illegal aliens from deportation. \n8   \n9  186.  Next, in a section labelled “Other Presidential Executive Actions Affecting Federal \n10  Financial Assistance Programs,” HUD Policy Terms state that “Recipients of Federal Awards must \n11  comply with applicable existing and future Executive Orders, as advised by the Department, including \n12  but not limited to . . . :” followed by a “non-exhaustive list” of nine executive orders—including the \n13  Immigration Order, the Abortion Order, the DEI Order, and the Gender Ideology Order—as “applicable” \n14  conditions.  The HUD Policy Terms then summarize the potentially applicable policies reflected in those \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  executive orders. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  a. First, the HUD Policy Terms state that the Immigration Order “prohibits taxpayer \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  resources and benefits from going to unqualified aliens.” \nN\nN\nRE 18  b. Second, the HUD Policy Terms summarize the Abortion Order as “prohibit[ing] the use of \n19  Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion.” \n20  c. Third, the HUD Policy Terms state that the DEI Order “requires Federal agencies to \n21  terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences.” \n22  d. Fourth, the HUD Policy Terms summary the Gender Ideology Order as “set[ting] forth \n23  U.S. policy recognizing two sexes, male and female.” \n24  187.  These requirements outlined in the HUD Policy Terms are unlawful because the \n25  requirements violate the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-\n26  vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n27   \n28   \n    -49-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 50 of 96\n1  b.  HUD attaches a new, unlawful anti-DEI certification to its standard \n2  assurances and certifications \n3  188.  In or around May 2025, HUD updated its standard Applicant and Recipient Assurances \n4  and Certifications (the “HUD Certifications”) on Form HUD-424-B, which must be submitted as part of \n5  any application for HUD funding or post-award submission.  These changes implemented President \n6  Trump’s executive orders, including the DEI Order, by imposing a new anti-DEI certification that is not \n7  authorized by any of the statutes that establish HUD grant programs, any appropriations law \n8  appropriating funds for HUD grant programs, or HUD’s own regulations.  In particular, the HUD \n9  Certifications require HUD grant applicants to certify that the applicant: \n10  Will not use Federal funding to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion \n(DEI) mandates, policies, programs, or activities that violate any applicable \n11  Federal antidiscrimination laws. \n12  189.  This certification is unlawful, as explained further below, because the anti-DEI \n13  certification violates the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-\n14  vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  c.  HUD announces it will attach new, unlawful conditions to Office of \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Community Planning and Development grants \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  190.  In or around June 2025, HUD’s CPD, which administers the CDBG, ESG, HOME, and \nN\nN\nRE 18  HOPWA programs, among others, issued guidance announcing that it will attach new conditions to \n19  Fiscal Year 2025 agreements governing all CPD-administered grants. \n20  191.  In particular, on June 5, 2025, CPD General Deputy Assistant Secretary Claudette \n21  Fernandez issued a letter to the executive directors of two organizations representing states and local \n22  jurisdictions that administer CPD grant programs (the “Fernandez Letter”).  The Fernandez Letter states \n23  that CPD “[g]rantees are . . . encouraged to review the White House Executive Orders as they develop \n24  their consolidated plan and annual action plans,” which are required under the CDBG, HOME, HOPWA, \n25  and ESG programs.  Letter from Claudette Fernandez, Acting Director, CPD General Deputy Assistant \n26  Secretary, to Council of State Community Development Agencies and National Community \n27  Development Association (June 5, 2025), https://ncdaonline.org/wpcontent/uploads/2025/06/6-5-2025-\n28  HUD-Response-to-COSCDA-NCDA.pdf.  \n    -50-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 51 of 96\n1  192.  The Fernandez Letter goes on to state that “FY2025 grant agreement[s]” that are issued \n2  after a recipient submits their consolidated and action plans will “emphasize conformity with applicable \n3  Administration priorities and executive orders.”  It clarifies that, “[u]nder the FY 2025 grant agreement, \n4  conformity means” that the recipient will be required to abide by a list of specific conditions.  These \n5  include the following (collectively, the “CPD Grant Conditions”): \n6  193.  First, grant recipients will be required to agree not to “not use grant funds to promote \n7  ‘gender ideology,’ as defined in [the Gender Ideology Order]” (the “CPD Gender Ideology Condition”). \n8  194.  Second, each recipient must “certif[y] that it does not operate any programs that violate \n9  any applicable Federal antidiscrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”  Each \n10  recipient must also “agree[] that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n11  discrimination laws is material to the U.S. Government’s payment decisions for purposes of [the FCA]” \n12  (together, the “CPD Discrimination Condition”).  \n13  195.  Third, grant recipients must agree that: \n P 14  [i]f applicable, no state or unit of general local government that receives \nU\nO funding under this grant may use that funding in a manner that by design or \nGRw  15  effect facilitates the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration or \nW La\nLAat  abets policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.  \nLIC eys  16   \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  (the “CPD Enforcement Condition”). \nN\nN\nRE 18  196.  Fourth, each recipient must agree to conditions purportedly related to PRWORA and other \n19  immigration eligibility and verification requirements, specifically: \n20  The Grantee must administer its grant in accordance with all applicable \nimmigration restrictions and requirements, including the eligibility and \n21  verification requirements that apply under title IV of the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, as \n22  amended (8 U.S.C. 1601-1646) (PRWORA) and any applicable \nrequirements that HUD, the Attorney General, or the U.S. Citizenship and \n23  Immigration Services may establish from time to time to comply with \nPRWORA, Executive Order 14218, or other Executive Orders or \n24  immigration laws. \n25  . . . . \n26  Unless excepted by PRWORA, the Grantee must use SAVE, or an \nequivalent verification system approved by the Federal government, to \n27  prevent any Federal public benefit from being provided to an ineligible \nalien who entered the United States illegally or is otherwise unlawfully \n28  present in the United States.  \n    -51-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 52 of 96\n1  (together, the “CPD Verification Condition”). \n2  197.  Fifth, “[u]nless excepted by PRWORA,” grant recipients “must use SAVE, or an \n3  equivalent verification system approved by the Federal government, to prevent any Federal public benefit \n4  from being provided to an ineligible alien who entered the United States illegally or is otherwise \n5  unlawfully present in the United States.” \n6  198.  Finally, grant recipients must agree that they will “not use any grant funds to fund or \n7  promote elective abortions, as required by [the Abortion Order]” (the “CPD Abortion Condition”). \n8  199.  In addition to imposing these conditions through grant agreements, HUD is threatening to \n9  disapprove consolidated plans—including plans that have already been submitted—unless jurisdictions \n10  resubmit revised plans that (1) include assurances that the jurisdictions will comply with the CPD Grant \n11  Conditions and (2) strip the plans of certain words that HUD claims, in and of themselves, violate the \n12  related EOs, such as “equity” and “environmental justice.” HUD is requiring these revisions and \n13  commitments with as little as 24 hours’ notice. \n14  200.  The CPD Grant Conditions are unlawful for the same reasons the other conditions are \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  unlawful, as explained above.  In particular, and as explained further below, the CPD Grant Conditions \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  violate the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  doctrine, and the APA. \nN\nN\nRE 18  3.  DOT and its Operating Administrations Attach New Conditions to DOT \n19  Grants  \n20  201.  Since Secretary Duffy’s confirmation, DOT and its operating administrations have \n21  implemented President Trump’s Executive Orders by attaching new and unlawful conditions \n22  (collectively, the “DOT Grant Conditions”) across the expansive portfolio of DOT grants established by \n23  Congress; demanding grant recipients’ agreement to those new conditions, sometimes on very short \n24  timelines; and issuing agency-wide letters and statements about how DOT will enforce those conditions.  \n25  202.  The DOT’s broad conception of these new conditions is confirmed in a letter from DOT \n26  Secretary Sean Duffy to all recipients of DOT funding stating that “[w]hether or not described in neutral \n27  terms, any policy, program, or activity that is premised on a prohibited classification, including \n28  discriminatory policies or practices designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals, presumptively violates \n    -52-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 53 of 96\n1  Federal Law.”  Letter from Sean Duffy, DOT Secretary, to All Recipients of DOT Funding (April 24, \n2  2025) (“April Duffy Letter”), https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-\n3  04/Follow%20the%20Law%20Letter%20to%20Applicants%204.24.25.pdf.    \n4  203.  The April Duffy Letter announced DOT’s “policy” of imposing immigration enforcement \n5  and anti-DEI conditions on all DOT-funded grants as a requirement of receiving funding, and makes \n6  clear that DOT interprets federal nondiscrimination law to presumptively prohibit “any policy, program, \n7  or activity that is premised on a prohibited classification, including discriminatory policies or practices \n8  designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals.”  It further asserts that recipients’ “legal obligations require \n9  cooperation generally with Federal authorities in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating \n10  with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other Federal offices and \n11  components of the Department of Homeland Security in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.”  \n12  The April Duffy Letter also threatens “vigorous[] enforcement,” ranging from comprehensive audits, \n13  claw-back of grant funds, and termination of grant awards to enforcement actions and loss of any future \n14  federal funding from DOT.  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  204.  Pursuant to the new policy set forth in the April Duffy Letter, DOT and its operating \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  administrations have attached substantially similar conditions relating to discrimination, immigration \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  enforcement, and executive orders to all grant agreements.  \nN\nN\nRE 18  a.  DOT and the FTA attach new, unlawful conditions to FTA Grants  \n19  205.  For instance, on March 26, 2025, the FTA issued an updated Master Agreement \n20  applicable to all funding awards authorized under specified federal statutes, including the FTA grant \n21  programs discussed above. \n22  206.  The March 26 Master Agreement imposed a new condition on all FTA grants \n23  implementing President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to condition federal grant funds \n24  on recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede this requirement is material for purposes of \n25  the FCA (“FTA Discrimination Condition”).  While FTA grants have long required compliance with \n26  nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the FCA, the March 26 Master Agreement provided: \n27  (1) Pursuant to section (3)(b)(iv)(A), Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the \n28  Recipient agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable \n    -53-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 54 of 96\nFederal antidiscrimination laws is material to the government’s payment \n1  decisions for purposes of [the FCA]. \n2  (2) Pursuant to section (3)(b)(iv)(B), Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, by entering \n3  into this Agreement, the Recipient certifies that it does not operate any \nprograms promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that \n4  violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. \n5  207.  That the FTA plans to enforce these new conditions more broadly than current \n6  nondiscrimination law is reinforced by the March 26 Master Agreement’s requirement that the recipient \n7  “comply with other applicable federal nondiscrimination laws, regulations, and requirements, and follow \n8  federal guidance prohibiting discrimination.”  \n9  208.  The FTA Discrimination Condition is in apparent tension with other requirements in the \n10  March 26 Master Agreement.  For example, the March 26 Master Agreement requires compliance with 2 \n11  C.F.R. § 300.321, which states, “[w]hen possible, the recipient or subrecipient should ensure that small \n12  businesses, minority businesses, women’s business enterprises, veteran- owned businesses, and labor \n13  surplus area firms” are, inter alia, “included on solicitation lists” and “solicited” when “deemed eligible.”  \n14  209.  The FTA Discrimination Condition is also in apparent tension with DOT’s own \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  regulations.  For example, 49 C.F.R. 21.5, which prohibits discrimination, states, “[w]here prior \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin to exclude \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under \nN\nN\nRE 18  any program or activity … the applicant or recipient must take affirmative action to remove or overcome \n19  the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or usage.”  49 C.F.R. 21.5(b)(7).  \n20  210.  Further, the March 26 Master Agreement defined “Federal Requirement” to include “[a]n \n21  applicable federal law, regulation, or executive order” (the “FTA EO Condition”).  The March 26 Master \n22  Agreement refers to President Trump’s DEI Order as an executive order “pursuant to” which the \n23  recipient must comply and certify, with no explanation of how the DEI Order relates to funding of mass \n24  transit.  \n25  211.  The April Duffy Letter to all recipients of DOT grants (including the FTA grants) further \n26  addresses the broad scope of the Administration’s anti-DEI agenda and how it expands and conflicts with \n27  established interpretations of federal nondiscrimination law, taking the position that any policy, program, \n28  or activity “designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals”—even if “described in neutral terms”—\n    -54-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 55 of 96\n1  ”presumptively” violates federal nondiscrimination laws.  The April Duffy Letter also threatens \n2  “vigorous[] enforcement,” ranging from comprehensive audits, claw-back of grant funds, and termination \n3  of grant awards to enforcement actions and loss of any future federal funding from DOT.  \n4  212.  On April 25, 2025, the FTA issued another updated Master Agreement applicable to all \n5  funding awards authorized under specified federal statutes, including the FTA grant programs discussed \n6  above.  \n7  213.  The April 25 Master Agreement (“FTA Master Agreement”) contains the same FTA \n8  Discrimination Condition and the same FTA EO Condition set forth above.  But the FTA Master \n9  Agreement contains an additional condition requiring recipients to cooperate with federal immigration \n10  enforcement efforts (the “FTA Enforcement Condition”).  \n11  214.  In particular, the FTA Enforcement Condition amends an existing provision addressing \n12  free speech and religious liberty as follows (new language emphasized): \n13  The Recipient shall ensure that Federal funding is expended in full \naccordance with the U.S. Constitution, Federal Law, and statutory and \n P 14  public policy requirements: including, but not limited to, those protecting \nU\nO free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, and \nGRw  15  prohibiting discrimination; and the Recipient will cooperate with Federal \nW La\nLAat  officials in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating with and \nLIC eys  16  not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other \nBn Federal offices and components of the Department of Homeland Security \nPE UAttor 17  in the enforcement of Federal immigration law. \nN\nN\nRE 18  215.  The April Duffy Letter to all recipients of DOT grants (including the FTA grants) states \n19  that “DOT expects its recipients to comply with Federal law enforcement directives and to cooperate \n20  with Federal officials in the enforcement of Federal immigration law” and that “[d]eclining to cooperate \n21  with the enforcement of Federal immigration law or otherwise taking action intended to shield illegal \n22  aliens from ICE detection contravenes Federal law and may give rise to civil and criminal liability.” \n23  216.  In May 2025, FTA retroactively applied the April 2025 FTA Master Agreement to grants \n24  that were executed pursuant to earlier versions of the agreement.  By substituting those earlier \n25  agreements with the FTA Master Agreement, the FTA purported to unilaterally add new substantive \n26  conditions to previously awarded grants without notifying the grant recipients.  \n27  217.  Neither the statutory provisions creating the FTA grants, the relevant appropriations acts, \n28  nor any other legislation authorizes the FTA to condition these funds on the recipient’s certification that \n    -55-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 56 of 96\n1  it does not “promote DEI,” its admission that its compliance with this prohibition is material for purposes \n2  of the FCA, or its agreement to “cooperate” with federal immigration enforcement efforts.  Federal grant \n3  recipients are required to comply with nondiscrimination and other applicable federal laws.  But \n4  executive orders and letters from agency heads cannot change what these laws require under existing \n5  court decisions. \n6  218.  In sum and as further explained below, the FTA Discrimination Condition, the FTA EO \n7  Condition, and the FTA Enforcement Condition (collectively, the “FTA Grant Conditions”) violate the \n8  Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti- commandeering principle, the \n9  Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n10  b.  DOT and the FHWA attach new, unlawful conditions to FHWA \n11  Grants  \n12  219.  On March 17, 2025, DOT issued revised General Terms and Conditions applicable to \n13  Fiscal Year 2024 SS4A grants (“FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions”). \n14  220.  The FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions imposed a new condition on all Fiscal \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Year 2024 SS4A grants implementing President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  condition federal grant funds on recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede this \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  requirement is material for purposes of the FCA (“SS4A Discrimination Condition”).  While SS4A \nN\nN\nRE 18  grants have long required compliance with nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the FCA, the \n19  FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions provided:  \n20  (b)  Pursuant to Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination \nand Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the Recipient agrees that its \n21  compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination \nlaws is material to the government’s payment decisions for purposes of [the \n22  FCA]. \n23  (c)  Pursuant to Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination \nand Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, by entering into this agreement, \n24  the Recipient certifies that it does not operate any programs promoting \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that violate any applicable \n25  Federal anti-discrimination law. \n26  221.  The SS4A Discrimination Condition is in apparent tension with other requirements in the \n27  FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions.  For example, the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and \n28  Conditions require compliance with 2 C.F.R. § 300.321, which states, “[w]hen possible, the recipient or \n    -56-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 57 of 96\n1  subrecipient should ensure that small businesses, minority businesses, women’s business enterprises, \n2  veteran-owned businesses, and labor surplus area firms” are, inter alia, “included on solicitation lists” \n3  and “solicited” when “deemed eligible.”  \n4  222.  The SS4A Discrimination Condition is also in apparent tension with DOT’s own \n5  regulations.  For example, 49 C.F.R. 21.5, which prohibits discrimination, states, “[w]here prior \n6  discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin to exclude \n7  individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under \n8  any program or activity . . . the applicant or recipient must take affirmative action to remove or overcome \n9  the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or usage.”  49 C.F.R. 21.5(b)(7). \n10  223.  The FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions contain an additional condition \n11  requiring recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts (the “SS4A Enforcement \n12  Condition”).  \n13  224.  In particular, the SS4A Enforcement Condition amends a pre-existing provision \n14  addressing free speech and religious liberty as follows (new language emphasized): \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  The Recipient shall ensure that Federal funding is expended in full \nW La\nLAat  accordance with the United States Constitution, Federal law, and statutory \nLIC eys  16  and public policy requirements: including but not limited to, those \nBn protecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, \nPE UAttor 17  and prohibiting discrimination; and Recipient will cooperate with Federal \nNN officials in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating with and \nRE 18  not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other \nFederal offices and components of the Department of Homeland Security \n19  in the enforcement of Federal immigration law. \n20  225.  Exhibit A to the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions also requires the recipient \n21  to assure and certify that it will “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, \n22  policies, guidelines, and requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal \n23  funds for this Project” (the “SS4A EO Condition”).  While this requirement existed in a similar form in \n24  prior agreements, Exhibit A to the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions lists President Trump’s \n25  DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order (among other recent Trump Administration executive orders), as \n26  well as two criminal immigration statutes (8 U.S.C. § 1324 and 8 U.S.C. § 1327) as “provisions” \n27  purportedly “applicable” to SS4A grant agreements, with no explanation of how those Orders or statutes \n28  relate to roadway grants or even apply to local governments.  \n    -57-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 58 of 96\n1  226.  Also on March 17, 2025, DOT issued revised General Terms and Conditions applicable to \n2  Fiscal Year 2023 SS4A grants and to Fiscal Year 2022 SS4A grants.  Those revised General Terms and \n3  Conditions, and the revised Exhibit A to each, contain provisions identical to the SS4A Discrimination \n4  Condition, the SS4A Immigration Condition, and the SS4A EO Condition discussed above. \n5  227.  On April 22, 2025, the FHWA issued Competitive Grant Program General Terms and \n6  Conditions purportedly applicable to all FHWA competitive grants (“2025 FHWA General Terms and \n7  Conditions”). \n8  228.  The 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions imposed a new condition on all FHWA \n9  competitive grants (including the BIP, Culvert AOP Program, and ATTAIN program discussed above) \n10  implementing President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order and further explained in the April \n11  Duffy letter, to condition federal grant funds on recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede \n12  this requirement is material for purposes of the FCA (“FHWA Discrimination Condition”).  While \n13  FHWA grants have long required compliance with nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the \n14  FCA, the 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions provide: \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  (b) Pursuant to Section (3)(b)(iv)(A), Executive Order 14173, Ending \nW La\nLAat  Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the \nLIC eys  16  Recipient agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable \nBn Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment \nPE UAttor 17  decisions for purposes of [the FCA]. \nN\nN\nRE 18  (c) Pursuant to Section (3)(b)(iv)(B), Executive Order 14173, Ending \nIllegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, by entering \n19  into this agreement, the Recipient certifies that it does not operate any \nprograms promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that \n20  violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. \n21  229.  The 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions contain an additional condition requiring \n22  recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts (the “FHWA Enforcement \n23  Condition”). \n24  230.  In particular, the FHWA Enforcement Condition incorporates immigration enforcement \n25  into a provision addressing compliance with federal law and policy as follows 8 (immigration \n26  enforcement language emphasized): \n27  The Recipient shall ensure that Federal funding is expended in full \naccordance with the United States Constitution, Federal law, and statutory \n28  and public policy requirements: including but not limited to, those \n    -58-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 59 of 96\nprotecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, \n1  and prohibiting discrimination; and the Recipient will cooperate with \nFederal officials in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating \n2  with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement  (ICE)  \nand other Federal offices and components of the Department of Homeland \n3  Security in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.  \n4  231.  The Exhibits to the 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions—dated April 30, 2025 \n5  and applicable to FHWA competitive grants—further require the recipient to assure and certify that it \n6  will “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, policies, guidelines, and \n7  requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal funds for this Project” (the \n8  “FHWA EO Condition”).  The Exhibits list President Trump’s DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order \n9  (among other recent Trump Administration executive orders), as well as two criminal immigration \n10  statutes (8 U.S.C. § 1324 and 8 U.S.C. § 1327), as “provisions” purportedly “applicable” to FHWA \n11  competitive grant agreements, with no explanation of how those Orders or statutes relate to highway \n12  grants or even apply to local governments. \n13  232.  Additionally, the April Duffy Letter (described in paragraphs 85 and 86 above) was \n14  directed to all recipients of DOT grants, including those receiving FHWA grants. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  233.  Neither the statutory provisions creating the FHWA grants, the relevant appropriations \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  acts, nor any other legislation authorizes the FHWA or DOT to condition these funds on the recipient’s \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  certification that it does not “promote DEI,” its admission that its compliance with this prohibition is \nN\nN\nRE 18  material for purposes of the FCA, or its agreement to “cooperate” with federal immigration enforcement \n19  efforts.  Federal grant recipients are required to comply with nondiscrimination and other applicable \n20  federal laws.  But executive orders and letters from agency heads cannot change what these laws require \n21  under existing court decisions.  \n22  234.  In sum and as further explained below, the SS4A Discrimination Condition, the SS4A \n23  Enforcement Condition, the SS4A EO Condition, the FHWA Discrimination Condition, the FHWA \n24  Enforcement Condition, and the FHWA EO Condition (collectively, the “FHWA Grant Conditions”) \n25  violate the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti- commandeering \n26  principle, the Fifth Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n27  c.  DOT and the FAA attach new, unlawful conditions to FAA Grants   \n28  235.  Implementing the April Duffy Letter and the Trump Administration Executive Orders, on \n    -59-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 60 of 96\n1  April 25, 2025, the FAA issued a proposal labeled “Notice of modification of Airport Improvement \n2  Program grant assurances; opportunity to comment,” providing notice and soliciting public comments on \n3  modifications to the Grant Assurances (“2025 FAA Grant Assurances”).  In its notice, the FAA stated \n4  that the 2025 FAA Grant Assurances would become effective immediately, notwithstanding the \n5  opportunity to comment.  \n6  236.  The 2025 FAA Grant Assurances require the sponsor to assure and certify that it will \n7  “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, policies, guidelines, and \n8  requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal funds for this Grant.”  \n9  While this requirement existed in a similar form in prior versions of the Grant Assurances, the 2025 FAA \n10  Grant Assurances list President Trump’s DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order (among other recent \n11  Trump Administration executive orders), and incorporates all other executive orders, including the \n12  Immigration Order, as “provisions” purportedly “applicable” to grant agreements, even though these \n13  Orders on their face do not apply to non-federal entities and do not relate to funding of airport \n14  development or infrastructure.  Congress has not directed or authorized that the DEI Order, Gender \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Ideology Order, or Immigration Order be imposed as Grant Assurances. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  237.  Implementing the April Duffy Letter and the Trump administration Executive Orders, on \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  May 6, 2025, FAA posted on its website a revised grant agreement template for 2025 for AIG grants with \nN\nN\nRE 18  added terms and conditions that did not appear in prior iterations of FAA grant agreements (“FY 2025 \n19  FAA AIG Grant Template”).  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template has not been circulated for \n20  comment, as is statutorily required for changes to Grant Assurances. \n21  238.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template imposes a new condition on all AIG grants that \n22  implements President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to condition federal grant funds on \n23  recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede that this requirement is material for purposes of \n24  the FCA (the “FAA Discrimination Condition”).  While FAA grants have long required compliance with \n25  nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the FCA, the FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template \n26  provides: \n27  Pursuant to Section (3)(b)(iv), Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal \nDiscrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, the sponsor: \n28 \n    -60-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 61 of 96\na. Agrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n1  discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment decisions for \npurposes of [the FCA]; and  \n2 \nb. certifies that it does not operate any programs promoting diversity, \n3  equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that violate any applicable Federal \nanti-discrimination laws. \n4   \n5  239.  The FAA Discrimination Condition is in apparent tension with statutorily required Grant \n6  Assurances imposed on sponsors with respect to FAA grant funds.  For example, one of the statutorily \n7  required Grant Assurances sponsors must make for airport development grants is that the airport sponsor \n8  will take necessary action to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that at least 10 percent of all \n9  businesses at the airport selling consumer products or providing consumer services to the public are small \n10  business concerns owned and controlled by “a socially and economically disadvantaged individual” or \n11  other small business concerns in historically underutilized business zones.  49 U.S.C. § 47107(e)(1).  \n12  “Socially and economically disadvantaged individual” is defined to include “Black Americans, Hispanic \n13  Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities,” as well as women.  49 \n14  U.S.C. § 47113(a)(2); 15 U.S.C. § 637(d). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  240.  The FAA Discrimination Condition is also in apparent tension with DOT’s own \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  regulations.  For example, 49 C.F.R. 21.5, which prohibits discrimination, states, “[w]here prior \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin to exclude \nN\nN\nRE 18  individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under \n19  any program or activity … the applicant or recipient must take affirmative action to remove or overcome \n20  the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or usage.”  49 C.F.R. 21.5(b)(7).  And the FAA \n21  Discrimination Condition is in tension with other provisions of the FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template.  \n22  For example, the FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template states that the “sponsor’s [Disadvantaged Business \n23  Enterprise] and [Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise] programs as required by 49 \n24  C.F.R. Parts 26 and 23, and as approved by DOT, are incorporated by reference in this agreement.”  But \n25  49 C.F.R. 23.25(e), for instance, requires the use of “race-conscious measures” in implementing the \n26  Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program when race-neutral measures, standing \n27  alone, are not projected to be sufficient to meet an overall goal, and sets forth examples of race-conscious \n28  measures airports can implement. \n    -61-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 62 of 96\n1  241.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template contains an additional condition requiring \n2  sponsors to cooperate with the enforcement of any federal law, including federal immigration \n3  enforcement efforts (the “FAA Enforcement Condition”).  \n4  242.  In particular, the FAA Enforcement Condition incorporates immigration enforcement into \n5  a provision addressing free speech and religious liberty as follows (immigration enforcement language \n6  emphasized): \n7  The Sponsor shall ensure that Federal funding is expended in full \naccordance with the United States Constitution, Federal law, and statutory \n8  and public policy requirements: including but not limited to, those \nprotecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, \n9  and prohibiting discrimination; and the Sponsor will cooperate with \nFederal officials in the enforcement of Federal law, including cooperating \n10  with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nand other Federal offices and components of the Department of Homeland \n11  Security in and the enforcement of Federal immigration law.  \n12  243.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template further states with respect to immigration: “Title \n13  8 - U.S.C., Chapter 12, Subchapter II - Immigration.  The sponsor will follow applicable federal laws \n14  pertaining to Subchapter 12, and be subject to the penalties set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1324, Bringing in and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  harboring certain aliens, and 8 U.S.C. § 1327, Aiding or assisting certain aliens to enter.”  The FY 2025 \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  FAA AIG Grant Template does not explain how those criminal immigration statutes relate to airport \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  grants or even apply to local governments.  \nN\nN\nRE 18  244.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template also requires the sponsor to assure and certify \n19  that it will “comply with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, policies, guidelines, \n20  and requirements as they relate to the application, acceptance, and use of Federal funds for this Grant” \n21  (the “FAA EO Condition”).  While this requirement existed in a similar form in prior agreements, the FY \n22  2025 FAA AIG Grant Template lists President Trump’s DEI Order and Gender Ideology Order (among \n23  other recent Trump Administration executive orders), and incorporates all other executive orders, \n24  including the Immigration Order, as “provisions” purportedly “applicable” to grant agreements, with no \n25  explanation of how those Orders relate to funding of airport development or infrastructure or apply to \n26  local governments. \n27  245.  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template also states that the “FAA may terminate this \n28  agreement and all of its obligations under this agreement” in certain circumstances, including if “FAA \n    -62-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 63 of 96\n1  determines that termination of this agreement is in the public interest”; and further states that “[i]n \n2  terminating this agreement under this section, the FAA may elect to consider only the interests of the \n3  FAA” (the “FAA Termination Condition”).  The FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template does not define \n4  “the public interest” or “the interests of the FAA” that would support a termination decision or expressly \n5  limit those interests to the funding of airport development or infrastructure.  \n6  246.  AIP and AIG grant agreements require sponsors to certify a number of sponsor assurances \n7  (i.e., the Grant Assurances described above) that require sponsors to maintain and operate their facilities \n8  safely, efficiently, and in accordance with specified conditions, including compliance with numerous \n9  statutes, agency rules, and executive orders. \n10  247.  Additionally, The April Duffy Letter was directed to all recipients of DOT grants, \n11  including those receiving FAA grants.  \n12  248.  Neither the statutory provisions authorizing the FAA grants, the relevant appropriations \n13  acts, nor any other legislation authorizes the FAA or DOT to condition the granting of these funds on the \n14  recipient’s certification that it does not “promote DEI,” its admission that its compliance with this \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  prohibition is material for purposes of the FCA, or its agreement to “cooperate” with federal immigration \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  enforcement efforts.  Federal grant recipients are required to comply with nondiscrimination and other \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  applicable federal laws.  But executive orders and letters from agency heads cannot change what these \nN\nN\nRE 18  laws require under existing court decisions.  \n19  249.  In sum and as further explained below, the FAA Discrimination Condition, the FAA \n20  Enforcement Condition, the FAA EO Condition, the FAA Termination Condition (collectively, the “FAA \n21  Grant Conditions”), including in the 2025 Grant Assurances, FAA AIG Grant Template, and any other \n22  agreement, template, assurances, or other terms and conditions, violate the Separation of Powers, the \n23  Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti- commandeering principle, and the Fifth Amendment’s \n24  void-for-vagueness doctrine. \n25  4.  HHS and its Operating Divisions and Agencies Attach New Conditions to \n26  HHS Grants \n27  250.  HHS and its operating divisions and agencies have implemented President Trump’s \n28  Executive Orders by making changes to HHS policy and attaching new and unlawful conditions \n    -63-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 64 of 96\n1  (collectively, the “HHS Grant Conditions”) across the expansive portfolio of HHS grants established by \n2  Congress and demanding grant recipients’ agreement to those new conditions. \n3  251.  For example, on April 16, 2025, HHS issued an updated HHS Grants Policy Statement \n4  (2025 HHS GPS) applicable to discretionary grants that is “incorporated by reference in the official \n5  Notice of Award (NoA) as a standard term and condition.”  It applies to “awards and award \n6  modifications that add funding made on or after April 16, 2025,” includes “supplements to award, \n7  competing and non-competing continuations,” and applies to “all HHS recipients and the requirements \n8  flow down to subrecipients.”  The 2025 HHS GPS “is incorporated by reference as a standard term and \n9  condition of awards.”  The 2025 HHS GPS states that it does not apply to nondiscretionary awards, but \n10  that “HHS agencies have the discretion to apply certain parts of the GPS to non-discretionary awards and \n11  other policies to” non-discretionary awards.2 \n12  252.  The 2025 HHS GPS imposed a new condition on HHS grants implementing President \n13  Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to condition federal grant funds on recipients’ agreement \n14  not to promote DEI and to concede this requirement is material for purposes of the FCA (“HHS \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Discrimination Condition”).  While HHS grants have long required compliance with nondiscrimination \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  laws and have been subject to the FCA, the 2025 HHS GPS states that in addition to filing Form HHS \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  690 (Assurance of Compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws, which was previously required \nN\nN\nRE 18  under older versions of the GPS), “recipients must comply with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination \n19  laws material to the government’s payment decisions for purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 372(b)(4).”  Further, \n20  the 2025 HHS GPS states that “By accepting the grant award, recipients are certifying that . . . [t]hey do \n21  not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or \n22  promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws . . \n23  . .” For this purpose, the following definitions apply: \n24  (a) DEI means “diversity, equity, and inclusion.”  \n25  (b) DEIA means “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.” \n26  (c) Discriminatory equity ideology has the meaning set forth in Section \n2(b) of Executive Order 14190 of January 29, 2025. \n27 \n \n28  2 The 2025 HHS GPS does not apply to NIH grant awards. \n    -64-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 65 of 96\n. . . . \n1 \n(e) Federal anti-discrimination laws means Federal civil rights law that \n2  protect individual Americans from discrimination on the basis of race, \ncolor, sex, religion, and national origin.  \n3   \n4  253.  In addition to these agency-wide conditions, several HHS operating divisions and \n5  agencies have issued their own requirements.  For example, CDC recently issued updated general terms \n6  and conditions for both research and non-research awards.  Those updated general terms and conditions \n7  incorporate the 2025 HHS GPS as applicable grants policy with which recipients must comply. \n8  254.  SAMHSA recently issued updated general terms and conditions for discretionary grants.  \n9  Those updated general terms and conditions incorporate the 2025 HHS GPS as applicable grants policy \n10  with which recipients must comply.  Moreover, in April 2025, SAMHSA updated its Notice of Funding \n11  Opportunity (NOFO) Application Guide to state that “[a]ll activities proposed in your application and \n12  budget narrative must be in alignment with the current Executive Orders” (the “SAMHSA EO \n13  Condition”) and that “[f]unds cannot be used to support or provide services, either directly or indirectly, \n14  to removable or illegal aliens” (the “SAMHSA Immigration Condition”). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  255.  On July 25, 2025, HRSA issued updated general terms and conditions applicable to “all \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  active awards.”  The revised HRSA terms and conditions incorporate the 2025 HHS GPS as applicable \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  grants policy with which recipients must comply.  They also contain the following provision (the “HRSA \nN\nN\nRE 18  Gender Ideology Condition”): \n19  By accepting this award, including the obligation, expenditure, or \ndrawdown of award funds, recipients, whose programs, are covered by \n20  Title IX certify as follows: \n21  •  Recipient is compliant with Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972, as amended, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq., including the \n22  requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled \nDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and \n23  Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government, and Title VI \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq., and \n24  Recipient will remain compliant for the duration of the Agreement. \n25  •  The above requirements are conditions of payment that go the \nessence of the Agreement and are therefore material terms of the \n26  Agreement. \n27  •  Payments under the Agreement are predicated on compliance with \nthe above requirements, and therefore Recipient is not eligible for \n28 \n    -65-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 66 of 96\nfunding under the Agreement or to retain any funding under the \n1  Agreement absent compliance with the above requirements.  \n2  •  Recipient acknowledges that this certification reflects a change in \nthe government’s position regarding the materiality of the foregoing \n3  requirements and therefore any prior payment of similar claims \ndoes not reflect the materiality of the foregoing requirements to this \n4  Agreement. \n5  •  Recipient acknowledges that a knowing false statement relating to \nRecipient’s compliance with the above requirements and/or \n6  eligibility for the Agreement may subject Recipient to liability \nunder the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, and/or criminal \n7  liability, including under 18 U.S.C. §§ 287 and 1001.  \n8  256.  It is not clear if HRSA’s assertion that compliance with Title IX (or any other \n9  nondiscrimination law) purportedly now requires agreement to the Gender Ideology Order is shared by \n10  other HHS operating divisions and agencies, or is implicitly imported into other operating divisions and \n11  agencies’ conditions requiring compliance with nondiscrimination laws that do not expressly contain this \n12  added gloss. \n13  257.  Meanwhile, on May 6, 2025, HHS sent a “Dear Colleague” letter to medical schools \n14  receiving federal funds, providing “[HHS’s] current interpretation of federal law.”  Regarding DEI, the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  letter stated “some American educational institutions . . . have adopted race-conscious policies under a \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  broader umbrella of concepts known as ‘systemic and structural racism’ and ‘diversity, equity, and \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  inclusion’ (DEI) to incorporate race-based criteria into training and discipline,” and “[a]dditionally, \nN\nN\nRE 18  certain DEI programs may confer advantages or impose burdens based on generalizations associated with \n19  racial identity, rather than evaluating individuals on their own merits.  Such programs can create a hostile \n20  environment, denying a student the ability to participate fully in school life because of the student’s \n21  race.” The letter also warned that institutions “found to be out of compliance with federal civil rights law \n22  may, consistent with applicable law, be subject to investigation and measures to secure compliance with \n23  may, if unsuccessful, affect continued eligibility for federal funding” and stated HHS would “prioritize \n24  investigations” of institutions that, among other things, require DEI or diversity statements in connection \n25  with hiring.  Letter from Anthony F. Archeval, Acting Director, HHS Office for Civil Rights, to medical \n26  schools that receive federal financial assistance (May 6, 2025), \n27  https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/guidance-med-schools-dear-colleague-letter.pdf.  \n28  258.  In a May 14, 2025 statement to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n    -66-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 67 of 96\n1  Pensions regarding President Trump’s FY 2026 budget, HHS Secretary Kennedy stated, among other \n2  things, that HHS is “committed to restoring a tradition of gold-standard, evidence based science—not \n3  one driven by politicized DEI, gender ideology, nor sexual identity.”  Secretary Kennedy also stated that \n4  “NIH will no longer issue grants to promote radical gender ideology to the detriment of America’s youth, \n5  or fund dangerous gain-of-function research, though related research will continue consistent with \n6  Administration policy and oversight.  Our Administration is committed to eliminating radical gender \n7  ideologies that poison the minds of Americans.”  Statement by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on the President’s \n8  Fiscal Year 2026 Budget before Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (May 14, 2025), \n9  https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/b1b74b8b-0612-8b5d-1904-\n10  a50babc1deea/HELP%20Secretary%20Kennedy%20Testimony.pdf.  \n11  259.  Neither the statutory provisions creating the HHS grants described in this Complaint, the \n12  relevant appropriations acts, nor any other legislation authorizes HHS, itself or through its operating \n13  divisions and agencies, to condition these funds on the recipient’s certification that it does not “promote” \n14  DEI or gender ideology or its admission that its compliance with these prohibitions is material for \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  purposes of the FCA.  Nor are Plaintiffs aware of any statute authorizing HHS, itself or through its \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  operating divisions and agencies, to impose such conditions on any other HHS grants that Plaintiffs have \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  previously received, currently receive, or are otherwise eligible to receive.  Federal grant recipients must \nN\nN\nRE 18  comply with nondiscrimination and other federal laws.  But executive orders and statements from agency \n19  heads cannot change what these laws require under existing court decisions. \n20  260.  In sum and as further explained below, the HHS Grant Conditions violate the Separation \n21  of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle, the Fifth \n22  Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the APA.  \n23  5.  EPA Attaches New Conditions to EPA Grants \n24  261.   EPA and its operating divisions and agencies have implemented President Trump’s \n25  Executive Orders by attaching new and unlawful conditions (collectively, the “EPA Grant Conditions”) \n26  across the expansive portfolio of EPA grants established by Congress and demanding grant recipients’ \n27  agreement to those new conditions. \n28  262.  For example, on April 3, 2025, EPA issued an updated General Terms and Conditions, \n    -67-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 68 of 96\n1  which included a new condition that states:  \n2  By accepting this EPA financial assistance agreement, (A) the recipient \nagrees that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n3  discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment decisions for \npurposes of [the Federal Claims Act]; and (B) the recipient certifies that it \n4  does not operate any programs promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \nthat violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws. \n5   \n6  U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, EPA General Terms and Conditions effective October 1, 2024 or later, \n7  https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-\n8  10/fy_2025_epa_general_terms_and_conditions_effective_october_1_2024_or_later.pdf.  \n9  263.  The revised EPA General Terms and Conditions impose this new condition on EPA grants \n10  implementing President Trump’s directive, as set out in the DEI Order, to condition federal grant funds \n11  on recipients’ agreement not to promote DEI and to concede this requirement is material for purposes of \n12  the FCA (“EPA Discrimination Condition”).  While EPA grants have long required compliance with \n13  nondiscrimination laws and have been subject to the FCA, executive orders and letters from agency \n14  heads cannot change what the laws require under existing court decisions.  The EPA Discrimination \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Condition requiring recipients to certify that compliance “in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  discrimination laws” is always “material” for purposes of the FCA, is unauthorized by Congress and \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  unconstitutionally vague.  Furthermore, “materiality,” under the FCA, “is a functional rather than \nN\nN\nRE 18  formulistic, inquiry” that requires courts to evaluate three factors, only one of which is whether the \n19  government’s payment was conditioned on compliance.  See United States ex rel. Bashir v. Boeing Co., \n20  765 F. Supp. 3d 1111, 1128–29 (W.D. Wash. 2025).  To determine materiality, a court also considered \n21  the government’s past enforcement of the requirement and the magnitude of the violation.  Id.  \n22  Accordingly, the EPA Discrimination Condition imposes an impermissibly vague legal standard that is \n23  broader than the statute allows. \n24  264.  In sum and as further explained below, the EPA Grant Conditions violate the Separation \n25  of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle, the Fifth \n26  Amendment’s void-for-vagueness doctrine, and the APA.  \n27   \n28   \n    -68-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 69 of 96\n1  6.  The New Grant Conditions Implementing and Incorporating the Executive \n2  Orders Are Unlawful \n3  a.  Incorporation of the Executive Orders is Unlawful \n4  265.  The conditions discussed above purport to incorporate executive orders as governing the \n5  use of federal funds.  These orders in many ways purport to adopt new laws by presidential fiat, amend \n6  existing laws, and overturn court precedent interpreting laws.  In so doing, the new grant conditions seek \n7  to usurp Congress’s prerogative to legislate and its power of the purse, as well as the judiciary’s power to \n8  say what the law means. \n9  266.  Furthermore, the executive orders are the President’s directives to federal agencies.  These \n10  orders are unintelligible and vague as applied to grant recipients, and as implemented in the unlawful \n11  conditions at issue.   \n12  267.  Without Congress passing his anti-DEI agenda, President Trump purports to have granted \n13  himself unchecked Article II powers to legislate by executive order and impose his decrees on state and \n14  local governments seeking grant funding. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  b.  The Discrimination Condition is Unlawful \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  268.  While Plaintiffs have routinely certified compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  as a condition of federal funding in the past, the Trump Administration’s communications to federal \nN\nN\nRE 18  grant recipients make clear that the agencies seek compliance with the Trump Administration’s novel, \n19  incorrect, and unsupported interpretation of federal nondiscrimination law as barring any and all DEI \n20  programs.  The Trump Administration’s conception of an “illegal” DEI program is contrary to actual \n21  nondiscrimination statutes and is inconsistent with what any court has endorsed when interpreting them.   \n22  269.  For instance, a February 5, 2025 letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi to DOJ \n23  employees states that DOJ’s Civil Rights Division will “penalize” and “eliminate” “illegal DEI and \n24  DEIA” activities and asserts that such activities include any program that “divide[s] individuals based on \n25  race or sex”—potentially reaching affinity groups or teaching about racial history.  Letter from Pam \n26  Bondi, Attorney General, to all DOJ Employees (Feb. 5, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/ \n27  1388501/dl?inline.   \n28  270.  Defendant Turner has stated that “HUD is carrying out Present Trump’s executive orders, \n    -69-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 70 of 96\n1  mission, and agenda,” by “[a]lign[ing] all programs, trainings, and grant agreements with the President’s \n2  Executive Orders, removing diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI).” Press Release No. 25-059, HUD \n3  Delivers Mission-Minded Results in Trump Administration’s First 100 Days, https://www.hud.gov/news/ \n4  hud-no-25-059 (emphasis added). \n5  271.  Neither the text of Title VI nor any other statute or other condition enacted by Congress \n6  prohibits recipients of federal funding from considering issues of diversity, equity, or inclusion.  The \n7  Supreme Court has never interpreted Title VI to prohibit diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.  \n8  Indeed, existing case law rejects the Trump Administration’s expansive views on nondiscrimination law \n9  with respect to DEI.  The President has no authority to declare, let alone change, federal \n10  nondiscrimination law by executive fiat.  Yet, the DEI Order seeks to impose his views on DEI as if they \n11  were the law by using federal grant conditions and the threat of FCA enforcement to direct and coerce \n12  federal grant recipients into acquiescing in his Administration’s unorthodox legal interpretation of \n13  nondiscrimination law.  \n14  272.  Accepting these conditions would permit Defendants to threaten Plaintiffs with \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  burdensome and costly enforcement action, backed by the FCA’s steep penalties, if they refuse to align \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  their activities with President Trump’s political agenda.  This threat is intensified by the grant conditions \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  that purport to have recipients concede the DEI certification’s “materiality”—an otherwise “demanding” \nN\nN\nRE 18  element of an FCA claim.  Further, even short of bringing a suit, the FCA authorizes the Attorney \n19  General to serve civil investigative demands on anyone reasonably believed to have information related \n20  to a false claim—a power that could be abused to target grant recipients with DEI initiatives the Trump \n21  Administration disapproves of.  See 31 U.S.C. § 3733. \n22  273.  The FCA is intended to discourage and remedy fraud perpetrated against the United \n23  States—not to serve as a tool for the Executive to impose unilateral changes to nondiscrimination law, \n24  which is instead within the province of Congress in adopting the laws and the Judiciary in interpreting \n25  them.  Requiring recipients to certify that compliance “in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-\n26  discrimination laws” is always “material” for purposes of FCA imposes an impermissibly vague standard \n27  that is broader than the statute allows. \n28 \n    -70-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 71 of 96\n1  c.  The Immigration Enforcement Condition is Unlawful \n2  274.  Congress has not delegated to Defendants the authority to condition grant funding on a \n3  recipient’s agreement not to “promot[e] . . . illegal immigration” or “abet[] policies that seek to shield \n4  illegal aliens from deportation.”  It is also unclear what type of conduct this might encompass, leaving \n5  federal grant recipients without fair notice of what activities would violate the prohibition and giving \n6  federal agencies free rein to arbitrarily enforce it. \n7  275.  Indeed, on April 24, 2025, Judge William H. Orrick of the United States District Court for \n8  the Northern District of California preliminarily enjoined the federal government from “directly or \n9  indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds from” sixteen cities and \n10  counties on the basis of Section 2(a)(ii) of the Immigration Order, which directs that no “Federal \n11  payments” be made to states and localities if the “effect,” even unintended, is to fund activities that the \n12  Administration deems to “facilitate” illegal immigration or “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies.”  City & \n13  Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 25-CV-01350- WHO, 2025 WL 1186310 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2025).  \n14  The court ruled that the direction “to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funding apportioned to \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  localities by Congress, violate[s] the Constitution’s separation of powers principles and the Spending \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Clause”; “violate[s] the Fifth Amendment to the extent [it is] unconstitutionally vague and violate[s] due \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  process”; and “violate[s] the Tenth Amendment because [it] impose[s] [a] coercive condition intended to \nN\nN\nRE 18  commandeer local officials into enforcing federal immigration practices and law.”  Id. at *2. \n19  d.  The Verification Condition is Unlawful  \n20  276.  Further, PRWORA does not authorize the Verification Condition for at least two reasons.  \n21  First, PRWORA explicitly does not require states to have an immigration status verification system until \n22  twenty-four months after the Attorney General promulgates certain final regulations.  8 U.S.C. § 1642(b).  \n23  Those regulations must, among other things, establish procedures by which states and local governments \n24  may verify eligibility and procedures for applicants to prove citizenship “in a fair and nondiscriminatory \n25  manner.”  Id. § 1642(b)(ii), (iii).  The Attorney General has issued interim guidance and a proposed \n26  verification rule, but has not implemented a final rule.  See Interim Guidance on Verification of \n27  Citizenship, Qualified Alien Status and Eligibility Under Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and \n28  Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, 62 Fed. Reg. 61344 (Nov. 17, 1997); Verification of \n    -71-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 72 of 96\n1  Eligibility for Public Benefits, 63 Fed. Reg. 41662 (Aug. 4, 1998) (proposed rule).  This failure to \n2  promulgate a final regulation left in place DOJ’s Interim Guidance, which requires only the examination \n3  of identity and immigration documentation.  62 Fed. Reg. at 61348–49.  Absent implementing \n4  regulations, Plaintiffs are not required to verify participants’ immigration status using SAVE or an \n5  equivalent verification system.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1320b-7.  Requiring recipients to do so exceeds the \n6  authority created in PRWORA. \n7  277.  Second, SAVE is a database operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, \n8  acting through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, that is sometimes used to assist federal \n9  immigration enforcement actions.  The Verification Condition would require Plaintiffs to gain access to \n10  this system, train their own employees how to use the system, and require them to enter immigration \n11  information.  Such an effort to commandeer local resources for matters related to federal immigration \n12  enforcement is counter to federal law, as well as applicable local and state laws precluding local \n13  participation in federal immigration enforcement. \n P 14  e.  The Gender Ideology Condition is Unlawful  \nU\nO\nGRw  15  278.  The Gender Ideology Condition improperly seeks to force federal grant recipients to no \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  longer recognize transgender, gender diverse, and intersex people by restricting funding that promotes \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  “gender ideology.”  This violates HUD’s own regulations, which require that grant recipients and \nN\nN\nRE 18  subrecipients ensure “[e]qual access to CPD programs, shelters, other buildings and facilities, benefits, \n19  services, and accommodations is provided to an individual in accordance with the individual’s gender \n20  identity, and in a manner that affords equal access to the individual’s family,” including facilities with \n21  “shared sleeping quarters or shared bathing facilities.”  24 C.F.R. § 5.106(b)–(c).  HUD regulations also \n22  prohibit subjecting an individual “to intrusive questioning or asked to provide anatomical information or \n23  documentary, physical, or medical evidence of the individual’s gender identity.” Id. § 5.106(b)(3). \n24  279.  While Defendant Turner announced HUD will no longer enforce these regulations, the \n25  regulations remain in effect and applicable to the CPD programs. \n26  280.  The Gender Ideology Condition is also vague.  The definition of “gender ideology” is not \n27  only demeaning, but also idiosyncratic and unscientific.  Further, given the expansive meaning of \n28  “promote,” federal agencies have free rein to punish recipients who merely collect information on gender \n    -72-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 73 of 96\n1  identity, which has long been authorized and encouraged by HUD in its binding regulations, as such \n2  information can be used to improve the quality and efficacy of homeless services. \n3  281.  The Trump Administration has already terminated federal funding as a result of agency \n4  action carrying out the Gender Ideology Order and related executive orders.  For example, one of the \n5  largest free and reduced-cost healthcare providers in Los Angeles reported that the U.S. Centers for \n6  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) terminated a $1.6 million grant that would have supported the \n7  clinic’s transgender health and social health services program.  The CDC ended the grant in order to \n8  comply with the Gender Ideology Order.  See Kristen Hwang, LA clinics lose funding for transgender \n9  health care as Trump executive orders take hold, Cal Matters (Feb. 4, 2025), https://calmatters.org/health/ \n10  2025/02/trump-executive-order-transgender-health/.  \n11  282.  On February 28, 2025, Judge Lauren King of the United States District Court for the \n12  Western District of Washington enjoined enforcement of the Gender Ideology Order in part (including \n13  parts the Gender Ideology Condition it incorporates by references), holding that the plaintiffs had shown \n14  a likelihood of success on their claims that the Order violates the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  protection and the separation of powers.  Washington v. Trump, 768 F. Supp. 3d 1239, 1261-77 (W.D. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Wash. 2025). \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  283.   Particularly relevant here, the Court ruled that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in \nN\nN\nRE 18  showing that “[b]y attaching conditions to federal funding that were . . . unauthorized by Congress,” \n19  subsections 3(e) and (g) of the Gender Ideology Order “usurp Congress’s spending, appropriation, and \n20  legislative 11 powers.”  Id. at *1261.  The Court explained that the Gender Ideology Order “reflects a \n21  ‘bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group’” by “deny[ing] and denigrat[ing] the very existence of \n22  transgender people.”  Id. at 1277 (citation omitted). \n23  f.  The Abortion Condition is Unlawful \n24  284.  The Abortion Condition (including the Abortion Order incorporated by reference) does \n25  not implement, but rather exceeds, the Hyde Amendment’s narrow prohibition on using federal funds to \n26  pay for, or require others to perform or facilitate, abortions.  While it purports to apply the Hyde \n27  Amendment—a provision that has been enacted in successive appropriations acts that limits the use of \n28  federal funds for abortions (subject to narrow exceptions)—in reality, it goes well beyond the Hyde \n    -73-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 74 of 96\n1  Amendment.  The Hyde Amendment to the 2024 Appropriations Act specifically and narrowly prohibits \n2  the use of appropriated funds to “require any person to perform, or facilitate in any way the performance \n3  of, any abortion” or to “pay for an abortion, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if \n4  the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape or incest.” Pub. L. 118-42, §§ 202, 203, 138 Stat. 25 \n5  (March 9, 2024).  But the Hyde Amendment to the 2024 Appropriations Act does not require grant \n6  recipients to refrain from “promot[ing] abortion”—a vague prohibition that is susceptible to arbitrary \n7  enforcement.  And in doing so, the Abortion Condition usurps Congress’s spending, appropriations, and \n8  legislative power.  In sum and as further explained below, Defendants’ imposition of the Abortion \n9  Condition violates the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void- for-\n10  vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n11  285.  In sum and as further explained below, Defendant’s imposition of the EO Grant \n12  Conditions violates the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s void- for-\n13  vagueness doctrine, and the APA. \n P 14  F.  Multiple Courts Have Issued Injunctions Preventing the Imposition of the Unlawful \nU\nO\nGRw  15  Grant Conditions  \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  286.  Since President Trump issued the executive orders directing federal agencies to impose \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  new conditions on grant funding and terminate funding for noncompliance, numerous plaintiffs—\nN\nN\nRE 18  including states, cities, and nonprofit organizations—have filed lawsuits seeking to enjoin the \n19  implementation of these directives.  In response, courts across the country have granted preliminary \n20  injunctions to halt enforcement of these unlawful conditions while litigation proceeds.  See e.g. Chicago \n21  Women in Trades v. Trump, No. 25 C 2005, 2025 WL 1114466 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 14, 2025); City & Cnty. of \n22  San Francisco v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01350-WHO, 2025 WL 1186310 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2025), \n23  opinion clarified, No. 25-CV-01350-WHO, 2025 WL 1358492 (N.D. Cal. May 9, 2025); S. Educ. Found. \n24  v. United States Dep’t of Educ., No. CV 25-1079 (PLF), 2025 WL 1453047 (D.D.C. May 21, 2025); \n25  Martin Luther King, Jr. Cnty. v. Turner, No. 2:25-CV-814, 2025 WL 1582368 (W.D. Wash. June 3, \n26  2025); San Francisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01824-JST, 2025 WL 1621636 (N.D. Cal. \n27  June 9, 2025). \n28  287.  On July 2, 2025, presumably in response to the numerous injunctions granted against \n    -74-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 75 of 96\n1  DOT and HUD, DOT Secretary Sean Duffy sent another letter to all recipients of DOT funding, \n2  attempting to walk back his earlier statements in the April Duffy Letter (described in paragraphs 85 and \n3  86 above).  The July Duffy Letter states: \n4  “I write to clarify that the Department will no longer enforce [Biden’s \nexecutive policies], or any other requirements incorporated into its Federal \n5  financial assistance agreements that are inconsistent with the policy \nobjectives of this Administration and current DOT leadership…This letter \n6  does not impose new conditions or requirements, but instead serves merely \nto provide notice that DOT will not enforce or require adherence to any of \n7  the [Biden executive policies]” \n8  Letter from Sean Duffy, DOT Secretary, to All Recipients of DOT Funding (July 2, 2025) (“July Duffy \n9  Letter”), https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-07/SecDOT%20letter%20to%20 \n10  recipients%20of%20FFA%2007022025.pdf.   \n11  288.  The July Duffy Letter directly contradicts his earlier April Letter, the Executive Orders, \n12  and the June 5th Letter from Claudette Fernandez.  Furthermore, the July letter completely ignores the \n13  provisions of Trump’s Executive Orders, which Defendants have implemented, that directs each federal \n14  agency head to include “in every contract or grant award” a term that the contractor or grant recipient \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  “certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI,” and directs all agency heads to ensure \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  “that Federal payments to States and localities do not, by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens \nN\nN\nRE 18  from deportation.”    \n19  289.  The conditions placed on HUD and DOT funding require more than compliance with pre-\n20  existing law.  The DEI Order, the Immigration Order, and subsequent agency letters broadly reinterpret \n21  the law to prohibit all DEI and require affirmative cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, \n22  indicating these new conditions are not reflective of existing law and instead are intended to further the \n23  Trump administration’s policy goals—not Congress’s.   \n24  290.  Although the July Duffy Letter purports to “clarify” the Department’s position, it does not \n25  retract or disavow the Administration’s prior threats to vigorously enforce its sweeping and unlawful \n26  interpretation of federal law.  Nowhere does the July Duffy Letter state that DOT will cease enforcing \n27  this Administration’s novel, overbroad, and contradictory interpretation of federal law, nor does it \n28  acknowledge the numerous official statements by federal officials warning that noncompliance with \n    -75-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 76 of 96\n1  these policies will result in the loss of funding.   \n2  G.  Plaintiffs, as Recipients of Pass-Through Grants, have a Reasonable Concern that \n3  the Challenged Conditions Apply to them \n4  291.  Local government entities that receive federal grant funds may receive the funds directly \n5  from a federal agency (as a direct recipient) or indirectly from a pass-through entity (as a sub-recipient).  \n6  Where a pass-through entity (for example, a state) provides federal funds to a sub- recipient (for \n7  example, a city or county within the state), the pass-through entity is responsible for ensuring the sub-\n8  recipient complies with applicable federal requirements.  See 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.332(b)(2) (pass-through \n9  entity must provide to the sub-recipient information regarding “[a]ll requirements of the subaward, \n10  including requirements imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the \n11  Federal award”), 200.332(e) (pass-through entity must “[m]onitor the activities of a subrecipient as \n12  necessary to ensure that the subrecipient complies with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and \n13  conditions of the subaward”); 2 C.F.R. Part 2400 (incorporating 2 C.F.R. Part 200 requirements with \n14  respect to federal awards made by HUD to non-federal entities); 2 C.F.R. Part 1201 (same for DOT).  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  292.  Consistent with 2 CFR § 200.332, the grant agreements and terms and conditions at issue \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  in this case incorporate applicable federal requirements against any sub-recipients.  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  293.  For example, the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions require that the recipient \nN\nN\nRE 18  “monitor activities under this award, including activities under subawards and contracts, to ensure … that \n19  those activities comply with this agreement,” and state that “[i]f the Recipient makes a subaward under \n20  this award, the Recipient shall monitor the activities of the subrecipient in compliance with 2 C.F.R. \n21  200.332(e).”  Exhibit A to the 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions—which incorporates the DEI \n22  and Gender Ideology Orders and two criminal immigration statutes as “applicable provisions” as \n23  discussed above—states that “[p]erformance under this agreement shall be governed by and in \n24  compliance with the following requirements, as applicable, to the type of organization of the Recipient \n25  and any applicable sub-recipients.”  The 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions, the Exhibits \n26  thereto, as well as the 2025 FAA Grant Assurances and FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template, contain \n27  similar language.   \n28  294.  The FTA Master Agreement requires that grant recipients take measures to assure that \n    -76-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 77 of 96\n1  “Third Party Participants” (defined to include sub-recipients) “comply with applicable federal laws, \n2  regulations, and requirements, and follow applicable federal guidance, except as FTA determines \n3  otherwise in writing.”  \n4  295.  Plaintiffs receive federal grant funds via pass-through grants (i.e., as sub-recipients) and \n5  has a reasonable concern, based on the April Duffy Letter, applicable regulations, and the grant \n6  agreement language discussed above, that the challenged grant conditions apply to their use of the pass-\n7  through funds. \n8  H.  Plaintiffs face an Impossible Choice of Accepting Illegal Conditions, or Forgoing \n9  Federal Grant Funding for Critical Programs and Services \n10  296.  The grant conditions that Defendants seek to impose leave Plaintiffs with the Hobson’s \n11  choice of accepting illegal conditions that are unauthorized by Congress, violate the Constitution, and \n12  accompanied by poison pill provisions that increase the risk of FCA claims, or forgoing the grant \n13  funds—funds paid (at least partly) through local federal taxes—that are essential for vital local services.  \n14  The uncertainty caused by these illegal conditions has impeded Plaintiffs’ ability to budget and plan for \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  services covered by the grants.  \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  297.  Defendants’ overbroad interpretation and enforcement of the EO Conditions is not \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  hypothetical.  On or around August 18, 2025, the City of Fresno received an email from HUD notifying it \nN\nN\nRE 18  “that the Department is questioning the accuracy of the City of Fresno’s certification that the Community \n19  Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds described in its Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action \n20  Plan (the Plan) will be administered in conformity with applicable laws, including Executive Orders.”  In \n21  the email, HUD explained that it had “identified language in Fresno’s 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action \n22  Plan “that is not consistent with Executive Order 14148 Additional Rescissions of Harmful Executive \n23  Orders and Actions, Executive Order 14151 Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs \n24  and Preferencing, Executive Order 14173 Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based \n25  Opportunity, and Executive Order 14168 Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and \n26  Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”  Specifically, HUD took issue with the \n27  following statements from Fresno’s 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action Plan: \n28 \n    -77-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 78 of 96\n“The DRIVE Plan has goals to improve housing affordability and stability, \n1  reduce racial and economic isolation and support environmental justice \nand sustainability, most of which are addressed in the strategic plan.”  \n2 \n“Emergency shelter for all genders and their dependent children who \n3  are fleeing domestic violence.” (emphasis added by HUD). \n4  298.  HUD stated that “[t]his language includes provisions that appear to be inconsistent with \n5  the implementation of federal programs pursuant to the referenced executive orders, and directed Fresno \n6  to “[r]emove or replace all ‘equity’ references throughout the document,” “[r]emove or replace all \n7  “environmental justice” references throughout the document,” “[r]emoving all “transgender” references \n8  throughout the document,” and provide assurances that “[t]he City of Fresno shall not use grant funds to \n9  promote ‘gender ideology,’ as defined in Executive Order (E.O.) 14168, Defending Women from Gender \n10  Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”   \n11  299.  HUD directed Fresno to take these actions no later than 12:00 pm EDT Thursday, August \n12  21, 2025, and provided that “failure to address HUD’s concerns regarding the certification may result in \n13  HUD determining that the certification is inaccurate or unsatisfactory, which will result in disapproval of \n14  the Plan.” \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  300.  Additionally, Defendants’ unlawful conduct has already occurred, causing delay and \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  uncertainty in Plaintiffs’ budgeting and long-term planning processes.  Furthermore, the deadlines for \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Plaintiffs to submit assurances and agreements containing the unlawful conditions to Defendants are \nN\nN\nRE 18  imminent.   \n19  301.  For example, on or around August 14, 2025, the City of Fresno received an additional \n20  Grant Offer and Agreement letter from the FAA regarding an ATP grant.  The Grant Offer included the \n21  2025 FAA Grant Assurances, which, as discussed above, incorporate the unlawful EO Conditions, as \n22  “provisions” purportedly “applicable” to grant agreements.  The Grant Offer stated, “You may not make \n23  any modification to the text, terms or conditions of the grant offer,” and provided that the offer will \n24  expire and the FAA will not be obligated to pay any part of the costs of the designated ATP project \n25  unless the offer has been fully executed and finalized on or before August 29, 2025. \n26  302.  Additionally, Fresno has already spent $13 million of FAA funding allocated for Fresno’s \n27  use on FAT’s terminal expansion project. Those funds are set to expire on September 30, 2025.  If \n28  Fresno and the other FAA Plaintiffs do not submit for reimbursement by the end of September, which \n    -78-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 79 of 96\n1  requires assuring compliance with the 2025 FAA Grant Assurances, they will lose out on millions of \n2  previously allocated federal funds.   \n3  303.  Fresno was also recently awarded a Brownfields and Land Revitalization RFL grant of \n4  $750,000 on August 5, 2025, with the mailing date of August 8, 2025.  For an RFL grant, the recipient \n5  demonstrates its commitment to carry out the award by either drawing down funds within 21 days after \n6  the EPA award or amendment mailing date.  Accordingly, Plaintiff City of Fresno has until August 26, \n7  2025, to either accept the award and the associated unlawful EO Conditions or forgo the $750,000.  \n8  Additionally, the City of Fresno has received notice from the EPA that it intends to award the City an \n9  additional grant that will also be subject to the unlawful EO Conditions. \n10  304.  Nor is the heightened FCA risk merely speculative.  A May 19, 2025, letter from Deputy \n11  Attorney General Todd Blanche to certain DOJ divisions and offices and all U.S. Attorneys states that \n12  DOJ is setting up a “Civil Rights Fraud Initiative”—co-led by DOJ’s Civil Fraud Section and Civil \n13  Rights Division—that will “utilize the [FCA] to investigate and, as appropriate, pursue claims against \n14  any recipient of federal funds that knowingly violates civil rights laws.”  The letter asserts the FCA “is \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  implicated whenever federal-funding recipients or contractors certify compliance with civil rights laws \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  while knowingly engaging in racist preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities, including \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that assign benefits or burdens on race, ethnicity, \nN\nN\nRE 18  or national origin.”  It further states that the Civil Fraud Section and Civil Rights Division will “engage \n19  with the Criminal Division, as well as with other federal agencies that enforce civil rights requirements \n20  for federal funding recipients” (including HUD) and “will also establish partnerships with state attorneys \n21  general and local law enforcement to share information and coordinate enforcement actions.”  Finally, \n22  the letter states that DOJ “strongly encourages” private lawsuits under the FCA and “encourages anyone \n23  with knowledge of discrimination by federal-funding recipients to report that information to the \n24  appropriate federal authorities so that [DOJ] may consider the information and take any appropriate \n25  action.”  Letter from Todd Blanche, Deputy Attorney General, to DOJ Offices, 19 Divisions, and U.S. \n26  Attorneys (May 19, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/dag/media/1400826/dl?inline.  \n27  305.  Withholding HUD grants from the HUD Plaintiffs could result in a loss of millions of \n28  dollars in funding for housing and other services that Plaintiffs have adopted to meet the basic needs of \n    -79-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 80 of 96\n1  their residents.  It would result in Plaintiffs being unable to serve their residents resulting in the loss of \n2  access to housing, healthcare, counseling, and other assistance.  This funding represents a significant \n3  percentage of those Plaintiffs’ total budgets for housing and community support programs, including \n4  community development and infrastructure improvements, affordable housing creation and rehabilitation, \n5  and homelessness services such as outreach, shelter, prevention, and rapid re-housing.  The loss of this \n6  funding would have devastating effects on Plaintiffs and their residents.  \n7  306.  Withholding DOT grants from Plaintiffs would result in the loss of hundreds of millions \n8  of dollars in funding for critical services and projects for their residents.   \n9  307.  Withholding FTA grants from the FTA Plaintiffs would result in the loss of funding for \n10  public transit services, including capital projects, maintenance, and improvements, which would cause \n11  long-lasting harm to Plaintiffs’ finances and lead to delays in or the elimination of critical transit projects.  \n12  The loss of this funding, which represents a significant percentage of those Plaintiffs’ total budgets for \n13  public transit services, would threaten transit improvements and safety initiatives and have severe \n14  negative impacts on these services. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  308.  Withholding FHWA grants from the FHWA Plaintiffs would result in the loss of funding \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  for street and roadway improvements, including enhancing pedestrian safety, reconfiguring major \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  roadways to decrease crashes and improve transit, and building bike lanes, that will result in long-lasting \nN\nN\nRE 18  harm to Plaintiffs’ finances, delays to or elimination of critical infrastructure and safety projects, and \n19  diversion of funds from other crucial local projects.  The loss of this funding, which represents a \n20  significant percentage of those Plaintiffs total budgets for street and roadway projects, would threaten \n21  roadway improvement and safety initiatives and have severe negative impacts on these projects. \n22  309.  Withholding FAA grants from the FAA Plaintiffs would result in the loss of funding for \n23  ongoing and future airport projects—including development and improvement of runways, taxiways, \n24  terminals, and control tower as well as airport transit, safety, and sustainability projects—that will result \n25  in long-lasting harm to those Plaintiffs’ finances, delays to or elimination of critical airport infrastructure \n26  and safety projects, and diversion of funds from other crucial projects.  The loss of this funding, which \n27  represents a significant percentage of those Plaintiffs’ total budgets for airport development and \n28  infrastructure projects, would threaten airport improvement and safety initiatives and have severe \n    -80-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 81 of 96\n1  negative impacts on these critical projects. \n2  310.  Withholding HHS grants from the HHS Plaintiff would threaten or eliminate critical \n3  individual and public health services for millions of residents.  Loss of funding could decimate public \n4  health budgets and cause residents, including those most vulnerable, to lose access to meals, medical \n5  care, housing, and lifesaving social safety net services. Loss of funding could also devastate local public \n6  health and child welfare agencies, which may be forced to conduct significant layoffs and operational \n7  reductions. \n8  311.  The prospective loss of these federal funds would be so catastrophic to Plaintiffs’ finances \n9  that the essential services it provides—including housing support, public transportation, street and \n10  roadway safety improvements, and airport operations—would be effectively halted.  Plaintiffs cannot \n11  replace these funds with local revenue without drastically cutting other critical services or abandoning \n12  their obligations to vulnerable populations.  Yet agreeing to the vague, unauthorized, and contradictory \n13  grant conditions—even if Plaintiffs were to make a good faith effort to revise their policies to comply—\n14  would expose them to significant liability.  Certifying compliance with these conditions carries an \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  intolerable risk of enforcement under the False Claims Act, and constitutional and statutory challenges \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  from stakeholders who could assert that Plaintiffs have adopted discriminatory or otherwise unlawful \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  policies in violation of their rights.  Plaintiffs thus face an impossible dilemma: either accept legal \nN\nN\nRE 18  jeopardy by complying with the conditions, or forfeit funding that is essential to the health, safety, and \n19  well-being of their residents. \n20  V.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n21  Count 1: Separation of Powers \n(All Grant Conditions) \n22 \n23  312.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though \n24  fully set forth herein. \n25  313.  The Constitution “exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the \n26  President.”  City & Cnty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018).  This power is \n27  “directly linked to [Congress’s] power to legislate,” and “[t]here is no provision in the Constitution \n28  that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  Id. (second alteration in \n    -81-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 82 of 96\n1  original) (quoting Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998)). \n2  314.  The Constitution vests Congress—not the Executive—with legislative powers, see \n3  U.S. Const. art. 1, § 1, the spending power, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1, and the appropriations \n4  power, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 9, cl. 7.  Absent an express delegation, only Congress is entitled to \n5  attach conditions to federal funds.  \n6  315.   “The Framers viewed the legislative power as a special threat to individual liberty, so \n7  they divided that power to ensure that ‘differences of opinion’ and the ‘jarrings of parties’ would \n8  ‘promote deliberation and circumspection’ and ‘check excesses in the majority.’”  Seila Law LLC v. \n9  Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 223 (2020) (quoting The Federalist No. 70, at 475 (A. \n10  Hamilton) and citing id., No. 51, at 350). \n11  316.  “As Chief Justice Marshall put it, this means that ‘important subjects … must be \n12  entirely regulated by the legislature itself,’ even if Congress may leave the Executive ‘to act under \n13  such general provisions to fill up the details.’”  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 737 (2022) \n14  (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (quoting Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42–43, 6 L. Ed. 253 (1825)). \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  317.  The separation of powers doctrine thus represents perhaps the central tenet of our \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Constitution.  See, e.g., Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 637–38 (2024); West Virginia v. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  EPA, 597 U.S. at 723–24; Seila Law LLC, 591 U.S. at 227; see also Clinton v. City of New York, \nN\nN\nRE 18  524 U.S. 417, 450 (1998) (“Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to \n19  transgress the separation of powers” (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  Consistent with these principles, \n20  the executive acts at the lowest ebb of his constitutional authority and power when he acts contrary \n21  to the express or implied will of Congress.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, \n22  637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \n23  318.  Pursuant to the separation of powers doctrine, the Executive Branch may not “claim[] \n24  for itself Congress’s exclusive spending power, . . . [or] coopt Congress’s power to legislate.”  City \n25  & Cnty. of S.F., 897 F.3d at 1234.  Indeed, the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the \n26  President to notify and request authority from Congress to rescind or defer the expenditure of funds \n27  before acting to withhold or pause federal payments.  2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq.  The President has not \n28  done so. \n    -82-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 83 of 96\n1  319.  Congress has not conditioned the provision of Defendants’ grants on compliance with \n2  a prohibition on all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification \n3  of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”  \n4  Nor has Congress delegated to Defendants the authority to attach the EO Grant Conditions \n5  unilaterally. \n6  320.  By imposing the EO Grant Conditions on grant recipients, Defendants are unilaterally \n7  attaching new conditions to federal funding without authorization from Congress.  \n8  321.  Further, the “[t]he interpretation of the meaning of statutes, as applied to justiciable \n9  controversies,” is “exclusively a judicial function.”  Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 \n10  U.S. 369, 411–13 (2024) (internal quotations omitted). \n11  322.  Here, Defendants seek to impose conditions that purport to require compliance with \n12  the law interpreted and envisioned by the Executive, contrary to Congress’s authority to legislate \n13  and the Judiciary’s interpretation of the law’s meaning. \n14  323.  For these reasons, Defendants’ conditioning of grants on compliance with the EO \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Grant Conditions violates the separation of powers doctrine.  \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Count 2: Spending Clause \nBn (All Grant Conditions) \nPE UAttor 17   \nN\nN\nRE 18  324.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n19  set forth herein. \n20  325.  The Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress”—not the \n21  Executive—”shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts \n22  and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States …”  U.S. Const. art. I, § \n23  8, cl. 1. \n24  326.  As described above, Defendants violate the separation of powers because the EO Grant \n25  Conditions are neither expressly nor impliedly authorized by Congress.  For the same reasons, \n26  Defendants violate the Spending Clause.  \n27  327.  The Spending Clause also requires States to have fair notice of conditions that apply to \n28  federal funds disbursed to them.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 25 (1981).  \n    -83-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 84 of 96\n1  The grant conditions must be set forth “unambiguously.”  Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. \n2  Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006). \n3  328.  Moreover, funding restrictions may only impose conditions that are reasonably related to \n4  the federal interest in the project and the project’s objectives.  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207, 208 \n5  (1987). \n6  329.  Finally, federal funds “may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities that \n7  would themselves be unconstitutional.”  Id. at 210. \n8  330.  Even if Congress had delegated authority to the Executive and HUD, DOT, HHS, or EPA \n9  to condition grant funding on terms prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \n10  immigration laws, verification of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender \n11  ideology” or “elective abortion.”, the EO Grant Conditions would violate the Spending Clause by: \n12  a.  imposing conditions that are ambiguous, see Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17; \n13  b.  imposing conditions that are so severe as to be coercive; \n14  c.  imposing conditions that are not germane to the stated purpose of grant program funds, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  see Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (“[C]onditions on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  unrelated ‘to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs.’”); and  \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  d.  with respect to the prohibition on promotion of “gender ideology,” imposing a condition \nN\nN\nRE 18  that purports to require grant recipients to act unconstitutionally by discriminating on the \n19  basis of gender identity and sex, see id. at 210. \n20 \nCount 3: Tenth Amendment \n(All Grant Conditions) \n21   \n22  331.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n23  set forth herein. \n24  332.  The Tenth Amendment provides that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by \n25  the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the \n26  people.”  U.S. Const. amend X. \n27  333.  Legislation that “coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own” “runs \n28  contrary to our system of federalism.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577–78 \n    -84-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 85 of 96\n1  (2012).  States must have a “legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for \n2  federal funds.”  Id. at 578. \n3  334.  Even if Congress had delegated authority to the Executive or Defendants to condition \n4  grant funds on any policy that “promotes” the Administration’s conception of an “illegal” DEI program \n5  or on participation in the Administration’s enforcement of federal immigration laws, the EO Grant \n6  Conditions would violate the Tenth Amendment by imposing conditions so severe as to coerce recipients \n7  of such funds to adopt the Administration’s reinterpretation of the law.  See id. at 579 (Congress may not \n8  impose conditions so severe that they “cross[] the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion.”).   \n9  Count 4: Fifth Amendment Due Process – Vagueness  \n(All Grant Conditions) \n10 \n11  335.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n12  set forth herein. \n13  336.  Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, a governmental enactment, like \n14  an executive order, is unconstitutionally vague if it “fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  enforcement.”  United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008). \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  337.  The EO Grant Conditions are unconstitutionally vague. \nN\nN\nRE 18  338.  Initially, each of the EO Conditions is vague in purporting to incorporate all executive \n19  orders.  Executive orders are the President’s directives to federal agencies and do not apply to federal \n20  grant recipients.  The purported incorporation of all executive orders into the recipient or sponsor’s use of \n21  grant funds renders the other new grant conditions vague.  \n22  339.  Each of the Discrimination Conditions fails to clearly define what conduct is prohibited \n23  and fails to specify clear standards for enforcement.  This uncertainty is amplified by agency letters and \n24  statements, including the April Duffy Letter and Turner statements, that conflict with federal statutes and \n25  case law. \n26  340.  The HUD Enforcement Condition (which incorporates by reference the Immigration \n27  Order) fails to define the terms “facilitates,” “subsidization,” or “promotion” with respect to “illegal \n28  immigration,” leaving federal grant recipients without fair notice of what would violate the prohibition. \n    -85-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 86 of 96\n1  341.  Similarly, each of the DOT Enforcement Conditions fails to define the terms “cooperate,” \n2  “cooperating,” “impeding,” and “enforcement” with respect to “Federal immigration law,” leaving \n3  federal grant recipients without fair notice of what would violate the prohibition. \n4  342.  Similarly, the FAA Termination Condition does not define “the public interest” or “the \n5  interests of the FAA” that would support a termination decision or expressly limit those interests to the \n6  funding of airport development or infrastructure, leaving federal grant recipients without fair notice of \n7  what would trigger termination of their grants. \n8  343.  The definition of “gender ideology” adopted in the Gender Ideology Condition is so vague \n9  as to require people of ordinary intelligence to guess as to what is prohibited.  By the same token, the \n10  Gender Ideology Condition affords unfettered discretion to Defendants to determine, based on their \n11  subjective interpretation, whether a federal grant is used to “promote gender ideology.”   \n12  344.  The meaning of the phrase “promote elective abortion” is also vague, leaving federal grant \n13  recipients without fair notice of what activities would violate the prohibition and affording Defendants \n14  unfettered discretion.  \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  345.  The vague terms and conditions described above are likely to chill individuals from \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  engaging in First Amendment-protected speech on matters of public concern \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  346.  Thus, the EO Grant Conditions are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth \nN\nN\nRE 18  Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n19  Count 5: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \n20  Arbitrary and Capricious \n(All Grant Conditions) \n21 \n22  347.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n23  set forth herein. \n24  348.  Defendant HUD, HHS, EPA, and DOT, as well as the DOT operating administrations (the \n25  FTA, the FHWA, and the FAA), are all “agenc[ies]” as defined in the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  \n26  Additionally, the HUD Grant Agreements, the FTA Master Agreement, the FY 2024 SS4A General \n27  Terms and Conditions, the 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions, the 2025 FAA Grant \n28  Assurances, the FY 2025 FAA AIG Grant Template, HHS’s revised Grants Policy Statement, and the \n    -86-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 87 of 96\n1  EPA’s updated General Terms and Conditions are all agency actions subject to review under the APA.   \n2  349.  Final agency actions (1) “mark the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decision making \n3  process” and (2) are ones “by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,’ or from which ‘legal \n4  consequences will flow.’”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997). \n5  350.  The HUD Grant Agreements are final agency actions because they reflect final \n6  decisions—in accord with presidential directives—to require grant recipients to comply with various \n7  Trump Administration policy priorities as a condition to receiving federal HUD funds.  See State ex rel. \n8  Becerra v. Sessions, 284 F. Supp. 3d 1015, 1031–32 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (holding that agency decision to \n9  impose new conditions on federal grants satisfies both tests for final agency action because it \n10  “articulate[s] that certain funds” will “require adherence to the” new conditions and “opens up the \n11  [recipient] to potential legal consequences,” including withholding of funds if the recipient declines to \n12  accept the conditions); Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 337 \n13  F. Supp. 3d 308, 328–29 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (same). \n14  351.  Similarly, the FTA Master Agreement, the FY 2024 SS4A General Terms and Conditions, \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  the 2025 FHWA General Terms and Conditions, the 2025 FAA Grant Assurances, the FY 2025 FAA \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  AIG Grant Template, HHS’s revised Grants Policy Statement, and the EPA’s updated General Terms and \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Conditions are final agency actions because they reflect final decisions—in accord with presidential \nN\nN\nRE 18  directives—to require grant recipients to comply with various Administration policy priorities as a \n19  condition to receiving federal funds. \n20  352.  These actions determine rights and obligations and produce legal consequences because \n21  they exercise purported authority to create new conditions on already awarded funds that would obligate \n22  recipients to comply with the Executive’s policy priorities. \n23  353.  Under the APA, a “court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n24  and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n25  accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n26  354.  “An agency action qualifies as ‘arbitrary’ or ‘capricious’ if it is not ‘reasonable and \n27  reasonably explained.’”  Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024) (quoting FCC v. Prometheus Radio \n28  Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021)).  A court must therefore “ensure, among other things, that the agency \n    -87-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 88 of 96\n1  has offered ‘a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between the facts \n2  found and the choice made.’”  Id. (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm \n3  Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  “[A]n agency cannot simply ignore ‘an important \n4  aspect of the problem’” addressed by its action.  Id. at 293. \n5  355.  HUD has provided no reasoned explanation for its decision to impose conditions related to \n6  prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verifying immigration \n7  status, and prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” and “elective abortion” on HUD funds \n8  that have no connection to those issues. \n9  356.  HUD has provided no reasoned basis for withholding funds Congress appropriated for \n10  disbursement, except to the extent the HUD Grant Agreements make clear HUD is enacting the \n11  President’s policy desires, as expressed in Executive Orders 14168, 14173, 14182, and 14218, in place of \n12  Congress’s intent. \n13  357.  HUD also ignores essential aspects of the “problem” it purports to address via the CPD \n14  programs, including the Plaintiff’s reasonable and inevitable reliance on now at-risk funds, the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  expectation of reimbursement from already appropriated funds, and the potential impacts on low-income \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  and homeless individuals and families who may be dissuaded from accepting services if they must verify \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  their immigration status or are unable to use their identified gender in doing so. \nN\nN\nRE 18  358.  Similarly, neither DOT nor its OAs have provided any reasoned basis for anti-DEI-related \n19  conditions to the FTA, FHWA, and FAA grants, seeking to impose the Administration’s view on all \n20  policies and programs, even when they are unrelated to programs receiving such grants.  Moreover, DOT \n21  and its EOs failed to explain how Plaintiffs could simultaneously comply with each of the DOT \n22  Discrimination Conditions, while also complying with statutory, regulatory, and other requirements that \n23  are in apparent tension with those Conditions. \n24  359.  Nor has HHS or the EPA provided a reasoned basis for imposing conditions related to \n25  “cooperation” with federal immigration enforcement on federal funds that have no connection to that \n26  issue. \n27  360.  Defendants have also ignored Plaintiffs’ reasonable reliance on awarded, but not yet \n28  obligated, funds and the expectation of reimbursement from already appropriated funds. \n    -88-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 89 of 96\n1  361.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n2  that Defendants imposing the EO Grant Conditions violates the APA because it is arbitrary and \n3  capricious; provide preliminary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and preliminarily and permanently enjoin \n4  Defendants from imposing those Conditions without complying with the APA.  \n5  Count 6: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \n6  Contrary to the Constitution  \n(All Grant Conditions) \n7 \n8  362.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n9  set forth herein. \n10  363.  Under the APA, a “court shall … hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n11  and conclusions found to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. \n12  § 706(2)(B).  \n13  364.  As described above, Defendants’ imposition of the EO Grant Conditions violates bedrock \n14  constitutional provisions and principles, including the separation of powers between the President and \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Congress, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment. \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  365.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n25  set forth herein. \n26  367.  Under the APA, a “court shall … hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n27  and conclusions found to be … in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \n28  statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n    -89-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 90 of 96\n1  368.  Defendants may exercise only authority granted to them by statute or the Constitution. \n2  369.  No law or provision of the Constitution authorizes Defendants to impose extra- statutory \n3  conditions not authorized by Congress on congressionally-appropriated funds. \n4  370.  Neither the Housing and Community Development Act, the Cranston-Gonzalez National \n5  Affordable Housing Act, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the AIDS Housing \n6  Opportunity Act nor any other legislation authorizes HUD to impose conditions on HUD grant funding \n7  related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification \n8  of immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”. \n9  371.  Similarly none of the statutes authorizing the HHS, EPA, FTA, FHWA, and FAA grants, \n10  nor the relevant appropriations acts, authorize Defendants to impose conditions on federal funding \n11  prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal immigration laws, verification of \n12  immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or “elective abortion.”. \n13  372.  Indeed, by threatening to unilaterally withhold funds on the basis of unauthorized agency-\n14  imposed grant conditions, Defendants attempts to circumvent the process established in the \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which requires the President to notify and request authority from \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Congress to rescind or defer the expenditure of funds before acting to withhold or pause federal \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  payments.  2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq. \nN\nN\nRE 18  373.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n19  that Defendants imposing the EO Grant Conditions violates the APA because it is in excess of \n20  Defendants’ statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; provide \n21  preliminary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from \n22  imposing those Conditions without complying with the APA.  \n23  Count 8: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \n24  Agency Action Contrary to Regulation \n(HUD Grant Conditions) \n25 \n26  374.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n27  set forth herein. \n28  375.  Under the APA, a “court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n    -90-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 91 of 96\n1  and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n2  accordance with law” or “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n3  376.  The NOFOs under which Plaintiffs were awarded HUD funding for FY 2024 contain no \n4  terms or conditions related to prohibiting all forms of DEI, facilitating enforcement of federal \n5  immigration laws, verifying immigration status, or prohibiting the “promot[ion]” of “gender ideology” or \n6  “elective abortion.”  \n7  377.  By imposing new terms and conditions on the HUD Grant Agreements not included in the \n8  NOFO or authorized elsewhere, HUD failed to comply with its own regulations governing the formation \n9  of CPD grant agreements and failed to observe the procedure required by law. \n10  378.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n11  that imposing the HUD Grant Conditions violates the APA because it is contrary to HUD’s own \n12  regulations and thus not in accordance with law and without observance of procedure required by law; \n13  provide preliminary relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and preliminarily and permanently enjoin HUD from \n14  imposing the HUD Grant Conditions without complying with the APA. \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  Count 9: Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Agency Action Without Procedure Required By Law \nBn (HUD, FTA, and FFA Grant Conditions) \nPE UAttor 17 \nN\nN\nRE 18  379.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully \n19  set forth herein. \n20  380.  Under the APA, a “court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, \n21  and conclusions found to be . . . without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n22  § 706(2)(D). \n23  381.  An agency “must abide by its own regulations.”  Fort Stewart Schs. v. Fed. Labor Rels. \n24  Auth., 495 U.S. 641, 654 (1990). \n25  382.  HUD has adopted regulations requiring it to proceed by notice-and-comment rulemaking \n26  including for “matters that relate to . . . grants.”  24 C.F.R. § 10.1 (“It is the policy of the Department of \n27  Housing and Urban Development to provide for public participation in rulemaking with respect to all \n28  HUD programs and functions, including matters that relate to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or \n    -91-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 92 of 96\n1  contracts . . . .”); 24 C.F.R. § 10.2 (definition of “rule”); 24 C.F.R. §§ 10.7–10.10 (notice-and-comment \n2  procedures); Yesler Terrace Cmty. Council v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 442, 447, 448 (9th Cir. 1994). \n3  383.  The FTA is subject to statutory notice-and-comment requirements for certain statements \n4  pertaining to grants issued under title 49, chapter 53 of the U.S. Code (including the FTA Grants).  \n5  Specifically, “[t]he Administrator of the [FTA] shall follow applicable rulemaking procedures under \n6  section 553 of title 5 before the [FTA] issues a statement that imposes a binding obligation on recipients \n7  of Federal assistance under this chapter.”  49 U.S.C. § 5334(k)(1).  For this purpose, “binding obligation” \n8  means “a substantive policy statement, rule, or guidance document issued by the [FTA] that grants rights, \n9  imposes obligations, produces significant effects on private interests, or effects a significant change in \n10  existing policy.”  Id. § 5334(k)(2). \n11  384.  The FTA, and the FAA have also adopted regulations requiring those agencies to proceed \n12  by notice-and-comment rulemaking when they promulgate substantive rules.  See 49 C.F.R. \n13  §§ 601.22(a), 601.24–601.28 (FTA); 14 C.F.R. Part 11 (FAA). \n14  385.  Through the HUD Grant Conditions, HUD has not just continued preexisting \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  requirements to comply with nondiscrimination laws and the other types of conditions approved by and \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  consistent with the relevant statutes and regulations, but also attached new conditions on HUD Grant \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  Agreements that require grant recipients to comply with various Administration directives as a condition \nN\nN\nRE 18  to receiving federal funds.  These new conditions thus comprise a substantive rule, not an interpretive \n19  rule or general statement of policy.  See, e.g., Yesler Terrace Cmty. Council, 37 F.3d at 449 (“Substantive \n20  rules … create rights, impose obligations, or effect a change in existing law pursuant to authority \n21  delegated by Congress.”); Erringer v. Thompson, 371 F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir. 2004) (explaining that a \n22  rule is substantive, i.e., “legislative,” inter alia, if there is no “adequate legislative basis for enforcement \n23  action” without the rule, or if the rule “effectively amends a prior legislative rule”). \n24  386.  In imposing the HUD Grant Conditions, HUD failed to comply with the notice-and-\n25  comment requirements set forth in its own regulations, and thus failed to observe the procedure required \n26  by law. \n27  387.  Through the FTA and FAA Grant Conditions the FTA and the FAA have not just \n28  continued preexisting requirements to comply with nondiscrimination laws and the other types of \n    -92-   \n \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:25-cv-07070     Document 1     Filed 08/20/25     Page 93 of 96\n1  conditions approved by and consistent with the relevant statutes and regulations, but attached new terms \n2  and conditions to FTA and FAA Grants that require grant recipients to comply with various \n3  Administration directives as a condition to receiving federal transit, and airport funds, which are \n4  substantive policy statements, rules, or guidance documents that impose obligations or effect significant \n5  changes in existing policy, not interpretive rules or general statements of policy. \n6  388.  In imposing the FTA Grant Conditions, the FTA failed to comply with the notice- and-\n7  comment requirements set forth in 49 U.S.C. § 5334(k)(1) and its own regulations, and thus failed to \n8  observe procedure required by law. \n9  389.  In imposing the FAA Grant Conditions, the FAA failed to comply with the notice- and-\n10  comment requirements set forth in its own regulations, and thus failed to observe procedure required by \n11  law.  \n12  390.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to declare under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n13  that imposing the HUD Grant Conditions, the FTA Grant Conditions, and the FAA Grant Conditions \n14  violates the APA because it is without observance of procedure required by law; provide preliminary \n P\nU\nO\nGRw  15  relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705; and preliminary and permanently enjoin Defendants from imposing those \nW La\nLAat \nLIC eys  16  Conditions without complying with the APA. \nBn\nPE UAttor 17  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nN\nN\nRE 18  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief: \n19  A.

INTRODUCTION \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Following a temporary restraining order (TRO) entered on August 26, 2025, Plaintiffs, \nS d nr\nee 17  local organizations and government entities that receive millions of dollars of federal grant money \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to serve the public, bring this Motion for a Preliminary Injunction to enjoin Defendants, agencies \n19  and their operating administrators, from imposing unauthorized and vague conditions on their \n20  grant funding. Defendants have announced grant conditions embracing the Administration’s recent \n21  Executive Orders requiring grantees to certify they will prohibit the promotion of DEI, gender \n22  ideology, and elective abortion and will cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. \n23  Plaintiffs contend that these grant conditions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the \n24  Fifth Amendment, Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, and the Tenth Amendment.  \n25  The preliminary injunction requested by Plaintiffs is granted as described below. First, \n26  jurisdiction properly rests in district court over Plaintiffs’ claims consisting of statutory and \n27  constitutional challenges to agency guidance and policy. Second, Plaintiffs meet the requirements \n28  for injunctive relief at this stage for their claims against the U.S. Department of Housing and \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 2 of 38\n \n1  Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), including the Federal \n2  Transit Administration (FTA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and Federal Aviation \n3  Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by \n4  demonstrating (1) serious questions going to the merits of their APA claims challenging the \n5  agency action as arbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory authority, and contrary to the \n6  Constitution, (2) likelihood of irreparable injury, (3) balance of hardships that “tips sharply \n7  towards [Plaintiffs]” and injunctive relief that is in the public interest. See All. for the Wild Rockies \n8  v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011). \n9  II. BACKGROUND \n10  a.  Grant Condition Executive Orders \n11  Between January and August 2025 President Trump issued a series of Executive Orders \n12  directing executive agencies to impose new conditions on federal grants (collectively, the “Grant \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Condition Executive Orders”). Executive Order No. 14151 Ending Radical and Wasteful \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Government DEI Programs and Preferencing calls for agencies to “terminate, to the maximum \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and ‘environmental justice’ offices and positions…; all \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts; \nS d nr\nee 17  and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees.” 90 Fed. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025) (“DEI Executive Order”). Executive Order No. 14173 Ending Illegal \n19  Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity “order[s] all executive departments and \n20  agencies… to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, \n21  activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements.  I[t] \n22  further order[s] all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal \n23  private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.” 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 \n24  (Jan. 31, 2025) (“Merit-Based Executive Order”). (Collectively, the DEI Executive Order and \n25  Merit-Based Executive Order are referred to as the “DEI Executive Orders.”) \n26  Executive Order No. 14168 Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism calls on \n27  “[a]gencies [to] remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 3 of 38\n \n1  internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and [to] cease \n2  issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages.  Agency \n3  forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender \n4  identity.  Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding \n5  of gender ideology.” EO No. 14168, 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 30, 2025) (“Gender Ideology \n6  Executive Order”). It further requires that “[f]ederal funds[] not be used to promote gender \n7  ideology.  Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant \n8  funds do not promote gender ideology.” Id. § 3(g). Executive Order No. 14182 Enforcing the \n9  Hyde Amendment states that “[i]t is the policy of the United States, consistent with the Hyde \n10  Amendment, to end the forced use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective \n11  abortion.” 90 Fed. Reg. 8751 (Jan. 31, 2025) (“Elective Abortion Executive Order”). \n12  Executive Order No. 14218 Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders requires each \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  agency to ensure illegal immigrants do not “obtain any cash or non-cash public benefit” from \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  federally funded programs and to align such programs “with Federal law including the PRWORA \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  [i.e., the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  104-193)].” 90 Fed. Reg. 10581 (Feb. 19, 2025). Executive Order No. 14287 Protecting American \nS d nr\nee 17  Communities From Criminal Aliens tasks agencies with “restor[ing] the enforcement of United \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  States [immigration] law” and suspending or terminating federal funds used by “sanctuary” \n19  jurisdictions in particular. 90 Fed. Reg. 18761 (Apr. 28, 2025). \n20  Executive Order No. 14332 Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking instructs that \n21  federal funding awards “must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President’s policy \n22  priorities” and must not “fund, promote, encourage, subsidize, or facilitate” “racial preferences or \n23  other forms of racial discrimination by the grant recipient, including activities where race or \n24  intentional proxies for race will be used as a selection criterion for employment or program \n25  participation;” “denial by the grant recipient of the sex binary in humans or the notion that sex is a \n26  chosen or mutable characteristic;” “illegal immigration;” or “any other initiatives that compromise \n27  public safety or promote anti-American values.” Section 4, 90 Fed. Reg. 38929 (Aug. 12, 2025). \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 4 of 38\n \n1  Additionally, “[e]ach agency head shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law and consistent \n2  with relevant Executive Orders or other Presidential directives, take steps to revise the terms and \n3  conditions of existing discretionary grants to permit immediate termination for convenience, or \n4  clarify that such termination is permitted, including if the award no longer advances agency \n5  priorities or the national interest.” Id. \n6  b.  Agency Grant Conditions \n7  In light of these Executive Orders, HUD, DOT, including the FTA, FHWA, and FAA, \n8  HHS, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have announced new grant conditions \n9  embracing the Grant Condition Executive Orders. These conditions have been announced through \n10  announcements of universal grant requirements, grant application guides, grant policy statements, \n11  grant and grant assurances templates, master agreements, notice of funding opportunities, and \n12  individual grant agreements. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Specifically, HUD has announced conditions that obligate grantees to certify that they \nCfi\n tclaC 14  comply with all Executive Orders (“HUD EO Conditions”); 1 do not promote DEI activities that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  violate anti-discrimination laws and are liable for non-compliance under the False Claims Act \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (“HUD DEI Conditions”); do not “promote” “gender ideology” (“HUD Gender Ideology \nS d nr\nee 17  Conditions”); do not “promote” “elective abortion” (“HUD Elective Abortion Condition”); \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  cooperate with federal immigration enforcement (“HUD Immigration Enforcement Conditions”) \n19  including using verification systems per PRWORA (“HUD PRWORA Condition”) (collectively \n20  the “HUD Grant Conditions”). DOT has announced conditions that obligate grantees to certify the \n21  same excluding the conditions regarding elective abortion and immigrant verification systems. \n22  DOT’s operating administrators also have announced similar or identical grant conditions \n23  applying additionally to their grantees: conditions obligating grantees to certify they comply with \n24 \n \n25  1 Since HUD, DOT, and the HHS require compliance with the EOs, the specific DEI, gender \nideology, elective abortion, and immigration enforcement requirements announced in those EOs \n26  are included in the definition of the agency’s more specific conditions. For example, the HUD DEI \nConditions include the DEI requirements set forth in the DEI and Imposing Oversight of Federal \n27  Grantmaking EOs. \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n4 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 5 of 38\n \n1  applicable EOs and federal laws, regulations, and policies; do not promote DEI that violates anti-\n2  discrimination law; and cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. These are referred to as \n3  the “DOT EO Conditions,” “DOT DEI Conditions,” “DOT Gender Ideology,” “DOT Immigration \n4  Enforcement Conditions,” and collectively the “DOT Grant Conditions.” \n5  HHS also has announced conditions that make substantially the same obligations of \n6  grantees (the “HHS EO Conditions,” “HHS DEI Conditions,” “HHS Gender Ideology \n7  Conditions,” “HHS Immigration Enforcement Conditions,” and collectively, the “HHS Grant \n8  Conditions”). The HHS DEI Conditions were announced in April 2025 revisions to the HHS Grant \n9  Policy Statement, and they are also reflected in HHS requirements to comply with applicable \n10  EOs.2 See e.g., Dkt. 36-24, Request for Judicial Notice3 (RJN), Exs. J, W, X. Since its April 2025 \n11  revisions to the HHS Grant Policy Statement, HHS has revised the relevant section of the Grant \n12  Policy Statement and removed reference to DEI, leaving only a prohibition against promoting \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  violations of applicable Federal anti-discrimination law (“HHS Anti-Discrimination Conditions”). \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Id. Exs. U, V. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Lastly, on April 3, 2025 the EPA announced revisions to its General Terms and Conditions \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  effective October 1, 2024 that obligate grantees to certify they do not promote DEI or violate \nS d nr\nee 17  federal-anti-discrimination law and are liable for non-compliance (“EPA DEI Conditions”). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  However, on August 25, 2025, the EPA revised the relevant section of its General Terms and \n19  Conditions removing reference to DEI, requiring that “recipient[s] certify that [they] do not \n20  operate any programs violating applicable Federal antidiscrimination law or promoting any such \n21  violation” (“EPA Anti-Discrimination Conditions”). Id., Ex. Z.  \n22  Taken together, excluding the EPA Anti-Discrimination Condition which was announced \n23  following issuance of the TRO, these conditions are referred to as the “Grant Conditions.” The \n24  conditions and their announcements are described in more detail in the discussion below as \n25 \n \n26 \n2 See supra note 1. \n27 \n3 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice is granted. \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n5 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 6 of 38\n \n1  relevant. \n2  c.  Plaintiffs’ Federal Funding \n3  Plaintiffs are cities, counties, and a county airport authority who receive millions of dollars \n4  in HUD, DOT, HHS, and/or EPA federal grant funding which they use to administer critical \n5  public programs and services such as housing assistance, transportation infrastructure and safety, \n6  public health, and environmental protection. This funding represents a significant portion of \n7  Plaintiffs’ funds. For example, federal grant funding made up between 9% and 15% of the City of \n8  Alameda’s expenditures between Fiscal Years 2022 and 2024. Dkt. 36-2, Ott Decl., ¶ 5. The \n9  Defendant agencies have made clear that Plaintiffs are subject to the Grant Conditions through \n10  general guidance as well as specific actions directed at Plaintiffs including warnings about liability \n11  and grant terminations. Plaintiffs, per their declarations, are left uncertain about if they can accept, \n12  drawdown, or seek this crucial federal funding, implicating both grants already awarded but also \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  grants applied for and dispensed on a continuous basis. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Eureka, City of Saint Paul, City of Alameda, City of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Redwood City, County of Sacramento, County of Marin, County of San Diego, and County of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Monroe, receive, directly or indirectly, millions of dollars of HUD grant funds administered \nS d nr\nee 17  through Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), the HOME Investment Partnerships \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Program (HOME), and Emergency Solutions Grants (ESA). These funds are threatened by the \n19  HUD Grant Conditions ratified through HUD action and guidance directed towards Plaintiffs. Dkt. \n20  36-15, Skei Decl., ¶ 7; Dkt. 36-7, Diaz Decl. ¶ 15; Dkt. 36-22, Bacher Decl., ¶ 19–20; Dkt. 36-5, \n21  Thomas Decl., ¶ 11. For example, on August 18, 2025, HUD notified Fresno that its FY 2025 \n22  Consolidated Plan/Action Plan would not be approved unless the City removed references to \n23  “equity,” “environmental justice,” and “transgender,” and certified compliance with EO 14168. \n24  Dkt. 36-15, Skei Decl., ¶¶ 7, 13–14. HUD formally disapproved the Plan on August 22, 2025, \n25  citing unsatisfactory certifications and rejecting Fresno’s request for additional time to respond. \n26  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Alameda, City of Eureka, City of South Lake Tahoe, City \n27  of Saint Paul, County of Marin, County of Sacramento, County of San Diego, County of Monroe, \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n6 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 7 of 38\n \n1  and Monroe Airport Authority receive grant funds, directly or indirectly, administered by DOT \n2  and its operating administrations, the FTA, FAA, and FHWA. For example, the County of Marin \n3  received $6 million in FHWA funding last year for highway maintenance, roadwork, and traffic \n4  safety and anticipates receiving $43 million over the next five years. Dkt. 36-4, Blunk Decl., ¶ 5. \n5  However, Plaintiffs’ DOT funding is threatened by the DOT Grant Conditions as with the HUD \n6  funding. For example, Redwood City has been awarded over $16 million in grants from the State \n7  of California Department of Transportation which receives FHWA funding via various federal \n8  projects. Dkt. 36-7, Diaz Decl., ¶ 23-24. However, it is not clear whether Redwood City can count \n9  on those funds since it is required to certify compliance with possibly unlawful conditions such as \n10  the DOT DEI Conditions which in fact conflict with other DOT policies that require \n11  considerations of equity. Id ¶ 24. As another example, the FHWA has already awarded $1.24 \n12  million in Carbon Reduction Program grants to the City of Alameda, but Alameda has not been \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  able to sign the award agreement due to uncertainty about the new grant conditions and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  certification requirements. Dkt. 36-2, Ott Decl., ¶ 6. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The County of Marin, County of Sacramento, and County of San Diego receive, directly or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  indirectly, grant funds administered by HHS. For example, the County of Marin’s Department of \nS d nr\nee 17  Health and Human Services has a budget of over $250 million and relies on approximately $57 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  million in federal funding, including $1.5 million in HHS Aging Cluster grants, $500,000 in Ryan \n19  White A and Part B grants, $2.8 million in Center for Disease Control (CDC) grants, $1.8 million \n20  in Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Adult Drug Grants, \n21  $2.4 million in Title IV-E Administration for Children and Families grants, and $1.4 million in \n22  HHS Adoption Assistance funding. Dkt. 36-6, Warhuus Decl., ¶¶ 6-7. As with HUD and DOT \n23  funding, Plaintiffs cannot rely on their HHS funding because the funds are subject to the unlawful \n24  HHS Grant Conditions. \n25  Plaintiffs City of Fresno, City of Redwood City, and the City of Alameda receive, directly \n26  or indirectly, grant funds administered by EPA. For example, Fresno has been awarded \n27  approximately $2.25 million in grants from the EPA, including a Brownfields Revolving Loan \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n7 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 8 of 38\n \n1  Fund grant totaling $1,750,000 and a Brownfields Assessment grant in the amount of $500,000. \n2  Dkt. 36-12, Clark Decl., ¶ 9. Redwood City has also been pre-awarded $1.2 million in EPA grants \n3  for stormwater infrastructure improvement. Dkt. 36-7, Diaz Decl., ¶ 31. The City of Alameda has \n4  a pending application for a $2.5 million Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change \n5  Grant. Dkt. 36-2, Ott Decl., ¶ 5. Plaintiffs are concerned that they cannot rely on their EPA \n6  funding in light of the EPA DEI Conditions and EPA Discrimination Conditions. \n7  III. LEGAL STANDARD \n8  Injunctive relief is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \n9  showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, \n10  22 (2008). To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, a plaintiff “must establish that he is likely to \n11  succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \n12  relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Id. at 20, 129 S.Ct. 365. A court may “balance the elements” of this test, “so long as a certain \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  threshold showing is made on each factor.” Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  2011) (per curiam). Thus, for example, “serious questions going to the merits and a balance of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, \nS d nr\nee 17  so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  injunction is in the public interest.” All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th \n19  Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted). \n20  IV. DISCUSSION \n21  A.  Threshold Issues \n22  i.  49 U.S.C. Section 46110 \n23  At the outset, jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs claims in federal district court must be \n24  established. Defendants challenge jurisdiction over the claims regarding FAA conditions in \n25  particular. Per 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a) federal courts of appeal have exclusive jurisdiction over “an \n26  order issued” by the Secretary of Transportation or FAA Administrator “with respect to aviation \n27  duties and powers designated to be carried out by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n8 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 9 of 38\n \n1  Administration … in whole or in part under this part, part B, or subsection (l) or (r) of section \n2  114.” Id. \n3  In Tulsa Airports Improvements Trust v. U.S.  the Ninth Circuit explained that \n4  Section 46110(a) covers “a broad spectrum of actions by the Secretary of Transportation, the \n5  Under Secretary of Transportation for Security, and the Administrator of the FAA” that “ha[ve] \n6  indicia of finality” but went on to point out that “many if not most of [the cases in which courts of \n7  appeals have undertaken review of the action] would fall into the category of ‘informal \n8  adjudication,’” which does not describe the at-issue agency actions. 120 Fed. Cl. 254, 261 (2015). \n9  See also City of Los Angeles v. U.S. F.A.A., 239 F.3d 1033, 1036 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[E]very court \n10  of appeals case that could be found exercising jurisdiction under § 46110(a) involved airline \n11  commerce and safety or a specific provision under Part A.”). Further, in City of Los Angeles v. \n12  U.S. F.A.A the Ninth Circuit held that since, “[i]n essence, the City seems to be making a ‘broad \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  constitutional challenge’ to… the FAA’s actions (to the extent that the FAA is making policy)… \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  such a claim is not one subject to judicial review in the court of appeals but rather is reviewable by \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the district court.” Id. at 1036–37. Since Plaintiffs’ claims against DOT are more akin to broad \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  constitutional challenges to DOT policy than informal adjudications, jurisdiction here is \nS d nr\nee 17  warranted. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Moreover, Section 46110(a) is also not a bar to jurisdiction because Plaintiffs’ claims \n19  “involve agencies” and agency action “not covered by § 46110.” Magassa v. Mayorkas, 52 F.4th \n20  1156, 1165 (9th Cir. 2022). See, e.g., Latif v. Holder, 686 F.3d 1122, 1128-29 (9th Cir. 2012). The \n21  FAA’s conditions are “merely a conduit” for the DOT Grant Conditions which DOT has \n22  expressed independently from FAA action via an April 2025 letter from the Secretary of \n23  Transportation (“Duffy Letter”) and non-FAA grants and grant guidance all of which “§ 46110 \n24  does not cover.” Latif v. Holder, 686 F.3d 1122, 1128-29 (9th Cir. 2012). Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. P. \n25  ii.  Tucker Act \n26  Under the Tucker Act, a dispute where money damages are sought pursuant to a contract or \n27  contract-like agreement with the federal government can be heard only in the Federal Court of \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n9 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 10 of 38\n \n1  Claims. 28 U.S.C. § 14191(a). The Tucker Act “‘impliedly forbid[s]’ an APA action seeking \n2  injunctive and declaratory relief only if that action is a ‘disguised’ breach-of-contract claim United \n3  Aeronautical Corp. v. United States Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 2023) (emphasis \n4  added) (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). An “action is a \n5  ‘disguised’ breach-of-contract claim” in light of “(1) the source of the rights upon which the \n6  plaintiff bases its claims and (2) the type of relief sought (or appropriate),” jurisdiction rests in the \n7  Court of Claims. United Aeronautical Corp. v. U.S. Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 2023) \n8  (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).  “If rights and remedies \n9  are statutorily or constitutionally based, then districts courts have jurisdiction; if rights and \n10  remedies are contractually based then only the Court of Federal Claims does, even if the plaintiff \n11  formally seeks injunctive relief.” Id. \n12  Plaintiffs’ claims here are not disguised contract claims. Nor do Plaintiffs seek the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  interpretation of specific grant terms and conditions. Instead, Plaintiffs challenge the Defendant \nCfi\n tclaC 14  agencies’ policies and guidance to condition funding on the Grant Conditions on statutory, namely \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  APA, and constitutional grounds, and they seek injunctive relief barring Defendants’ imposition \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  of the conditions and setting aside related internal agency directives. Accordingly, jurisdiction \nS d nr properly rests in federal district court. See id. See also Nat’l Institutes of Health v. Am. Pub. \nee 17 \nth\ninUtro Health Ass’n, 145 S. Ct. 2658, 2661 (2025) (Barrett, J., concurring in part) (“The Government is \nN 18 \nnot entitled to a stay of the judgments insofar as they vacate the guidance documents… That the \n19 \nagency guidance discusses internal policies related to grants does not transform a challenge to that \n20 \nguidance into a claim ‘founded…upon’ contract that only the CFC can hear.”); Dep’t of Educ. v. \n21 \nCalifornia, 604 U. S. ––––, 145 S.Ct. 966, 221 L.Ed.2d 515, 968 (2025) (“True, a district court’s \n22 \njurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an agency’s action may \n23 \nresult in the disbursement of funds.”) (quoting Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910 \n24 \n(1988)). \n25 \nB.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n26 \nPlaintiffs bring constitutional claims challenging the Grant Conditions, alleging violations \n27 \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n10 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 11 of 38\n \n1  of the Fifth Amendment, Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, and the Tenth Amendment. \n2  Separately, Plaintiffs advance APA claims challenging the Grant Conditions as arbitrary and \n3  capricious, in excess of statutory authority, and contrary to the Constitution. To obtain preliminary \n4  injunctive relief, Plaintiffs must establish likelihood of success on the merits as to at least one of \n5  these claims for each Grant Condition. \n6  Since the EPA DEI Conditions are no longer in effect following August 25, 2025 revisions \n7  to the EPA General Terms and Conditions, see Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. Z, and there is no evidence \n8  that the EPA is still enforcing its DEI Conditions or interprets its Anti-Discrimination Condition to \n9  prohibit promotion of DEI, Plaintiffs’ claims as to the EPA fail. As to the HUD, DOT, and HHS \n10  Grant Conditions, however, the court finds a likelihood of success on the merits for Plaintiffs’ \n11  arbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory authority, and contrary to the Constitution claims.4 \n12  i.  Reviewability under the APA \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  To review Plaintiffs’ APA challenges to the Grant Conditions, there must be “final agency \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  action” that is not “committed to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a)(2), 704. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Discretion is committed to an agency by law only where a “statute is drawn in such broad terms… \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of \nS d nr\nee 17  discretion.” Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 600 (1988) (citing Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  830 (1985)). See Jajati v. United States Customs & Border Prot., 102 F.4th 1011, 1014 (9th Cir. \n19  2024) (holding that the Section 701(a)(2) exception applies when “there is truly no law to apply”). \n20  The Supreme Court requires courts to “read the exception in § 701(a)(2) quite narrowly” such that \n21  it should apply only in “rare circumstances.” Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 586 \n22  U.S. 9, 23 (2018) (quoting Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191, (1993)). Even when Congress \n23  creates a wide zone within which decisions are committed to an agency’s discretion, the agency \n24  still must meet “permissible statutory objectives.” Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 183. See also Jajati, 102 \n25 \n \n26 \n4 There may also be freestanding constitutional claims, but we need not address those claims in \n27  that the APA claims sufficiently warrant the requested relief. \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n11 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 12 of 38\n \n1  F.4th at 1018 (holding that “the goal of the program,” “clear and consistent eligibility guidelines”, \n2  and “agency duties,” provided meaningful standards for review). \n3  Here, “meaningful standard[s]” exist to review Defendants’ Grant Conditions. Webster v. \n4  Doe, 486 U.S. at 592. Later in their briefing the Government points to statutory language as \n5  authorizing Defendants’ discretion to impose the Grant Conditions. The authorizing language \n6  grants Defendants at most discretion to impose grant terms that are necessary to effectuate each \n7  programs’ statutory aims. Dkt. 40 at 31; 42 U.S.C. § 11386(b)(8) (requiring HUD Continuum-of-\n8  Care (CoC) grantees to comply with “other terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish to \n9  carry out this part in an effective and efficient manner”); 49 U.S.C. § 5334(a)(9) (allowing grant \n10  covenants and terms that “the Secretary of Transportation considers necessary to carry out this \n11  chapter”); 49 U.S.C. § 47108(a) (permitting FAA grant offer terms that “the Secretary considers \n12  necessary to carry out this subchapter and regulations prescribed under this subchapter”); id. § \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  47107(g) (permitting the Secretary of Transportation to “prescribe requirements for [grant \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  recipients] that the Secretary considers necessary” “to ensure compliance with this section”); 42 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  U.S.C. § 300x-6(a)(7) (permitting Community Mental Health Services Block Grant assurances \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  which “the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out this subpart.”). This language creates \nS d nr\nee 17  standards “sufficient to permit judicial review.” See Keating v. F. A. A., 610 F.2d 611, 612 (9th \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Cir. 1979) (holding that allowing the FAA administrator to make exemptions “in the public \n19  interest” provides a standard “sufficient to permit judicial review.”). In addition to these \n20  necessary-to-achieve-statutory-aims standards, the authorizing statutes also include non-\n21  exhaustive criteria for grantmaking which help establish a meaningful standard for judicial review \n22  of the Grant Conditions. See e.g., Jajati, 102 F.4th at 1020. \n23  The Government, nonetheless, asserts that grant funding is “quintessential agency action[] \n24  committed to agency discretion by law.” Dkt. 40 at 30. The Government points to Lincoln v. Vigil \n25  in which the Supreme Court explained that agency action—such as the decision to terminate a \n26  program or funding to that program—that requires “a complicated balancing of a number of \n27  factors which are peculiarly within [the agency’s] expertise,” including whether “resources are \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n12 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 13 of 38\n \n1  best spent on one program or another; whether it is likely to succeed in fulfilling its statutory \n2  mandate; [and] whether a particular program best fits the agency’s overall policies” is generally \n3  committed to agency discretion by law. 508 U.S. at 193 (citing Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831). That, \n4  however, does not describe the agency action here. Plaintiffs do not challenge singular agency \n5  grant decisions made while weighing various factors “peculiarly in [Defendant agencies’] \n6  expertise,” and in order to vindicate each “agency’s overall policies” or “fulfill[] its statutory \n7  mandate.” See id. (cleaned up). Rather, Plaintiffs challenge Defendant agencies’ unilateral \n8  imposition of the Grant Conditions, which are not germane to Defendants’ expertise and were \n9  imposed not in the spirit of Defendants’ statutory mandates but rather to vindicate the Executive’s \n10  agenda. See e.g., Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. B (HUD Press Release No. 25-059 announcing grant \n11  conditions as part of “HUD []carrying out President Trumps’s executive orders, mission, and \n12  agenda…”). That the Grant Conditions are not imposed to further statutory aims is clear not only \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  from Defendants’ public statements but also because conditions prohibiting DEI, gender ideology, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and elective abortion and requiring cooperation with immigration enforcement are not part of or in \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  furtherance of Defendant agencies’ statutory mandates as discussed below. This break from the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  facts in Lincoln makes that decision inapposite because, as that case makes clear, “the decision to \nS d nr\nee 17  allocate funds is committed to agency discretion by law” only “to [the] extent” “the agency \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  allocates funds…to meet permissible statutory objectives.” Lincoln v.

Accordingly, the Grant Conditions are not agency action \n20  committed to agency discretion by law. \n21  To be reviewable the challenged agency action also must be final agency action. 5 U.S.C. § \n22  701(a)(2). This “finality[] must be interpreted in a pragmatic and flexible manner.” Oregon Nat. \n23  Desert Ass’n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 465 F.3d 977, 982 (9th Cir. 2006) (cleaned up). The Grant \n24  Conditions here are reviewable final agency action because they “take[ the] ‘definitive’ legal \n25  position” that the Executive Orders and Grant Conditions are authorized and enforceable against \n26  Plaintiffs, which poses an “immediate and significant practical burden” on Plaintiffs, rendering \n27  “the disputed [legal] authority underlying the [positions] fully fit for judicial review[.]” See CSI \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n13 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 14 of 38\n \n1  Aviation Servs., Inc. v.

Other courts have taken the same position that similar grant \n11  conditions are final agency action. See e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. Cnty. v. Turner, No. 2:25-CV-\n12  814, 2025 WL 1582368, *14 n.18 (W.D. Wash. June 3, 2025); Rhode Island Coal. Against \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Domestic Violence v.

Arbitrary and Capricious \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Under the APA, agency action must be set aside and held unlawful if it is “arbitrary, \nS d nr\nee 17  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it is not “‘reasonable and reasonably explained.’” Ohio \n19  v. Environmental Protection Agency, 603 U.S. 279, 292, 144 S.Ct. 2040, 219 L.Ed.2d 772 \n20  (2024) (citing FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423, (2021)). This includes when: \n21  the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely \nfailed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its \n22  decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it \ncould not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise. \n23 \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n24 \n(1983). The court may not “infer an agency’s reasoning from mere silence.” Arrington v. Daniels, \n25 \n516 F.3d 1106, 1112 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). \n26 \nThe standard is more exacting when an agency changes positions or “‘is not writing on a \n27 \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n14 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 15 of 38\n \n1  blank slate.’” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v.

Accordingly, when changing its \n5  position, an agency must “assess whether there were reliance interests, determine whether they \n6  were significant, and weigh any such interests against competing policy concerns.” Id. It is \n7  “arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.” Id. However, an agency “need not demonstrate \n8  to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old \n9  one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute[.]” F.C.C. v. Fox TV Stations, \n10  Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). Consistent with this standard, the Ninth Circuit in Thakur v. \n11  Trump5 recently found that the plaintiffs there, university researchers whose grants were \n12  terminated based on new DEI grant conditions, were likely to succeed on their arbitrary and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  capricious claims because the record provided no evidence of a reasoned explanation or \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  consideration of important factors, including reliance interests, waste and the loss to the public, or \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  alternatives to the change. 148 F.4th 1096 (9th Cir. 2025). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Prior to the Grant Conditions here, grant recipients were not subject—at least as a matter \nS de nre 17  of agency policy6—to conditions prohibiting the promotion of DEI, gender ideology, and elective \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  abortion or requiring cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. In fact, in some cases \n19  Defendant agency policies and regulations include grantee requirements that seemingly violate the \n20  Grant Conditions. See e.g., 24 C.F.R. § 5.106(b)–(c) (requiring “[e]qual access” to covered HUD \n21  programs according to participants’ self-identified gender). The fact that some conditions and EOs \n22  include language such as “… DEI programs that violate federal anti-discrimination law,” “…to \n23 \n \n24  5 Pending appeal on other grounds, specifically district court jurisdiction over the terminated \ngrants in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Nat’l Institutes of Health, No. 25A103 (U.S. \n25  Aug. 21, 2025). \n26  6 Contrary to the Government’s arguments, Plaintiffs’ challenges are not merely to grant \nterminations but to agency-wide polices regarding who is eligible for a grant and their liability as \n27  grant recipients. \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n15 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 16 of 38\n \n1  the maximum extent permitted by law,” or “consistent with” federal law does not transform them \n2  into pre-existing conditions to comply with federal law that were merely unspoken.

This \n5  is because the conditions’ references to federal law act as announcements of policies rather than as \n6  limits to the scope of the new conditions. In other words, these references to federal law make \n7  clear that their interpretation is undergoing significant change. Accordingly, the Grant Conditions \n8  reflect changes in agency position which require not only an explanation of reasoning but also \n9  consideration of reliance interests among other important factors. See Regents of the Univ. of \n10  California, 140 S. Ct. at 1915. \n11  Notably, “the fact that an agency’s actions were undertaken to fulfill a presidential \n12  directive does not exempt them from arbitrary-and-capricious review.” Kingdom v.

If it did, “presidential administrations [could] \nS d nr\nee 17  issue agency regulations that evade APA-mandated accountability by simply issuing an executive \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  order first. Agencies would be permitted to implement regulations without the public involvement, \n19  transparency, and deliberation required under the APA.” State v. Su, 121 F.4th 1, 16 (9th Cir. \n20  2024). Clearly this is not what the APA permits. See id. \n21  Here, however, HUD and HHS have provided “no substantive reasons justifying [their] \n22  radical change of course other than[] rote recitation of the need to implement the Executive \n23  Orders.” San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. v. AmeriCorps, No. 25-CV-02425-EMC, 2025 WL \n24  1713360, at *26 (N.D. Cal. June 18, 2025). The same is true for DOT with the exception of the \n25  Duffy Letter as discussed below. The Defendant agencies have announced their conditions without \n26  explanation through universal grant requirements, grant application guides, grant policy \n27  statements, templates, master agreements, notice of funding opportunities, and individual grant \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n16 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 17 of 38\n \n1  agreements.

HUD also has issued Press Release No. 25-059 which announces, “HUD is \n3  carrying out President Trumps’s executive orders, mission, and agenda…,” id., Ex. B, and a June \n4  2025 letter from the General Deputy Assistant Secretary regarding CDBG – Disaster Recovery \n5  grantees which reannounces that grantees are required to comply with the EOs, id., Ex. Q. \n6  These announcements are not enough because “rote incorporation of executive orders … \n7  does not constitute ‘reasoned decisionmaking’” as required by the APA. Martin Luther King, Jr. \n8  Cnty., No. 2:25-CV-814, 2025 WL 1582368, at *17. Further, they do make the requisite showing \n9  under the APA that Defendants considered the significant reliance interests of Plaintiffs and \n10  grantees like them who apply for, spend, and/or seek reimbursement via millions of dollars of \n11  federal funding on an ongoing and additive, or even nearly-automatic, basis.7 The announcements \n12  also do not show that the Defendant agencies considered the hundreds of millions of taxpayer \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  dollars already spent or allocated to  projects which may be jeopardized by the new grant \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  conditions and resulting budgeting uncertainty, delays, and cancellations or alternatives to the new \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  conditions such as proscribing grantee conduct with more particularity. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The Duffy Letter sent by Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy in April 2025 to \nS d nr\nee 17  transportation agencies nationwide is perhaps the one exception raised by Plaintiffs and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Defendants to the Defendant agencies’ failure to explain the Grant Conditions beyond reference to \n19  the Executive Orders. See Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. P. The letter references the Executive’s agenda \n20  but also explains that the DOT Conditions effectuate the Administration’s interpretation of federal \n21 \n \n22 \n7 For example, the City of Fresno has approximately $75 million in DOT grant funding allocated \n23  to it for public works projects—$37 million of which has yet to be reimbursed. Dkt. 36-13, Mozier \nDecl. ¶¶ 4, 8. Many of Fresno’s federal transportation programs operate on multi-year cycles, with \n24  funding becoming available two to four years after project selection, creating reliance interests on \ngrant funding conditions. Id. ¶ 10. This is emblematic of the federal funding scheme and process \n25  for not just DOT funding but also HUD and HHS funding: the grant process is often continual, \nmulti-year, and cumulative or automatic. For example, the City of Alameda has open HUD grant \n26  applications for approximately $2.05 million in CDBG grants and over half a million in HOME \ngrants that are awarded annually and generally automatically on a per capita basis.

President \n2  & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181 (2023). Id. Even if this can be said to provide a \n3  sufficiently reasoned explanation for the DOT DEI Conditions, however, the Duffy Letter still \n4  provides no record evidence that DOT considered reliance interests, possible waste or loss to the \n5  public, alternatives, or other important factors. See Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. P. Accordingly, Plaintiffs \n6  are likely to succeed on their claims that the HUD, DOT and HHS Grant Conditions are arbitrary \n7  and capricious in violation of the APA. \n8  iii. In Excess of Statutory Authority Claims \n9  Under the APA a court may set aside an agency action that is “in excess of statutory \n10  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). Plaintiffs \n11  here are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Grant Conditions are in excess of \n12  each Defendant’s statutory authority. They demonstrate, as set forth below, that the relevant \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  authorizing statutes do not authorize the Defendants to condition funding on requirements to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  prohibit the promotion of DEI, gender ideology, or elective abortion or to cooperate with federal \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  immigration enforcement and that in some cases the statutes even contradict the conditions. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Meanwhile, Defendants fail to rebut effectively Plaintiffs’ showings. Rather than reference \nS d nr\nee 17  statutory language authorizing these types of conditions expressly—likely because Defendants \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  cannot—Defendants rely on agency regulations and broad authorizations of grantmaking \n19  discretion which they argue encompasses the conditions here. However, “an agency regulation \n20  cannot create statutory authority; only Congress can do that.” Martin Luther King, Jr. Cnty., No. \n21  2:25-CV-814, 2025 WL 1582368, at *15. As to Defendants’ broad reading of these statutes, it \n22  flouts basic principles of statutory interpretation. Congress “rarely accomplishe[s]” \n23  “[e]xtraordinary grants of regulatory authority” through “modest words, vague terms, or subtle \n24  devices.” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) (cleaned up). This is especially true \n25  here where the Grant Conditions, as already discussed, are far afield from the agency expertise to \n26  which Congress originally deferred, and “expertise has always been one of the factors which may \n27  give an Executive Branch interpretation particular power to persuade.’” Cf. Loper Bright \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n18 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 19 of 38\n \n1  Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 402 (2024) (citation omitted) (collecting cases) (regarding \n2  deference to agency statutory interpretation as reflected in a formal agency rule rather than \n3  executive branch statutory interpretation as reflected in agency conditions and legal briefing as \n4  here). “‘[W]hen the agency has no comparative expertise… Congress presumably would not grant \n5  it that authority.’” Id. at 401 (2024) (citing Kisor v. Wilkie, 586 U.S. 1050, 578 (2018) (opinion of \n6  the Court)). \n7  Additionally, as already discussed, savings clauses such as “…which violate [relevant \n8  federal] law” or “to the maximum extent permitted by law” do not magically ensure that the \n9  conditions incorporating that language only operate in so far as they are within Congress’s grant of \n10  authority. See City and Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1238-1240 (upholding the lower \n11  court’s holding that the phrase “consistent with law” did not save certain executive orders). \n12  a.  HUD Grant Conditions \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Certain Plaintiffs receive CoC and other grants administered by CPD as part of the CDBG, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), HOME, and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (HOPWA) grant programs. The congressional acts authorizing these programs do not give HUD \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  authority to condition its grants on the Grant Conditions. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 5303–5304 \nS d nr\nee 17  (authorizing the CDBG program); id. § 11372 (authorizing the ESG program); id. § 12741 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (authorizing the HOME program); id. § 12903 (authorizing the HOPWA program); id. §§ \n19  5304(a)(3), 11375(c) (enumerating certifications required for certain CPD funding); id. §§ 11301, \n20  11381 (enumerating congressional findings and purpose for CoC program); id. §§ 11382(a), \n21  11386a (setting out competitive process and selection criteria for CoC awards); id. § 11386(b) \n22  (setting out agreements CoC recipients must make). In fact, the HUD DEI Grant Conditions run \n23  afoul of express congressional directives for CDBG, HOME, and HOPWA funds. For example, 42 \n24  U.S.C. § 5307(b)(2) requires CDBG funds be set aside for “[s]pecial purpose grants,” including \n25  grants to historically Black colleges. 42 U.S.C. § 5307(b)(2). Section 5307(c) requires CDBG \n26  funds be allocated to provide “assistance to economically disadvantaged and minority students.” \n27  Id. § 5307(c). Section 12702(3) sets out that HOME and HOPWA programs aim to improve \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n19 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 20 of 38\n \n1  housing opportunities for “disadvantaged minorities, on a nondiscriminatory basis,” and Section \n2  12831(a) requires HOME and HOPWA recipients “to establish and oversee a minority outreach \n3  program...to ensure the inclusion, to the maximum extent possible, of minorities and women, and \n4  entities owned by minorities and women...in all contracts… entered into by the participating \n5  jurisdiction.” Id. §§ 12702(3), 12703(3). \n6  The HUD PRWORA Verification Condition is also not authorized by Congress because \n7  PRWORA only requires state immigration status verification systems twenty-four months after the \n8  Attorney General promulgates certain final regulations, and so far only interim guidance and \n9  proposed rules have been issued. 8 U.S.C. § 1642(b). See Interim Guidance on Verification of \n10  Citizenship, Qualified Alien Status and Eligibility Under Title IV of the Personal Responsibility \n11  and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, 62 Fed. Reg. 61344 (Nov. 17, 1997); \n12  Verification of Eligibility for Public Benefits, 63 Fed. Reg. 41662 (Aug. 4, 1998) (proposed rule). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13    The Government argues that statutes authorizing HUD to condition grants on compliance \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  with federal laws encompass the conditions at issue. This argument fails for two reasons. First, as \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  already discussed, the Grant Conditions go beyond prohibiting violations of federal law as it is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  currently understood and pose a real risk of curtailing programs that would not be found violative. \nS d nr\nee 17  Second, the statutory authority cited for applying the conditions to HUD grants is limited to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  certification of compliance “with the other provisions of this chapter and with other applicable \n19  laws,” 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(6) (emphasis added), and conditions “the Secretary may establish to \n20  carry out this part in an effective and efficient manner,” 42 U.S.C. § 11386(b)(8). Dkt. 40 at 32. \n21  However, in light of the contradictory statutory mandates discussed above and the fact that HUD’s \n22  expertise is in housing not DEI programming, gender ideology, elective abortion, or immigration \n23  enforcement, such broad interpretations of 42 U.S.C. § 5304(b)(6)) and § 11386(b)(8) are \n24  unconvincing. \n25  b.  DOT Grant Conditions \n26  Some of the Plaintiffs receive various DOT grants including IFAC grants, FTA grants, \n27  FHWA grants including Safe Streets for All (SS4A), Bridge Investment Program (BIP), Culvert \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n20 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 21 of 38\n \n1  Aquatic Organism Passage (AOP), and Advanced Transportation Technology and Innovation \n2  (ATTAIN) grants, and FAA grants including Airport Improvement (AIP) grants and Airport \n3  Infrastructure Grants (AIG). Those plaintiffs demonstrate, as they did with HUD, that the \n4  congressional acts authorizing these programs do not give DOT authority to condition its grants on \n5  the DOT Grant Conditions. See e.g., 23 U.S.C. § 611 (codifying the IFAC grant program and \n6  including grant requirements relating to conducting, evaluating, publishing, and implementing \n7  asset concessions and infrastructure development); 49 U.S.C. ch. 53 (codifying various FTA \n8  grants related to urban transportation (§ 5307), fixed guideways (§ 5309), urban rail and bus \n9  upgrades (§ 5337), and buses and bus facilities (§ 5339) with statutory eligibility requirements \n10  regarding transit purposes, operational capacity, long-term asset maintenance, and project \n11  performance). Further, federal funding programs for many airport, transit, or highway \n12  infrastructure projects in fact require minority and disadvantaged business participation through \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program in direct conflict with the DOT DEI Conditions. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  See, e.g., 23 U.S.C. § 177(e)(2); 49 U.S.C. § 47113. 49 C.F.R. § 26.5 (establishing race and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  gender as criteria to be considered socially and economically disadvantaged). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    Again, the Government argues that DOT is authorized to condition funding per the DOT \nS d nr\nee 17  Grant Conditions based on broad interpretations of statutory language such as DOT may \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “prescribe terms for a project that receives Federal financial assistance,” 49 U.S.C. §5334(a)(1), \n19  DOT’s terms can include those it “considers necessary,” id. § 5334(a)(9), FAA project grant offers \n20  may include terms “the Secretary considers necessary to carry out this subchapter and regulations \n21  prescribed under this subchapter,” 49 U.S.C. § 47108(a), and DOT may “prescribe requirements \n22  for [grant recipients] that the Secretary considers necessary,” id. § 47107(g). Dkt. 40 at 33. Yet, it \n23  remains unclear how precluding DEI programming and gender ideology and cooperating with \n24  immigration enforcement are necessary to deliver effective transportation services. Accordingly, \n25  broad interpretations suggesting that DOT’s authority to condition federal funding is unlimited or \n26  at least reaches so far as the Grant Conditions do not hold water in light of the rule that agency \n27  interpretation of a statute is less persuasive when it does not invoke the agency’s expertise.

HHS Grant Conditions \n3  As with HUD and DOT, Congress has not authorized HHS to condition its grants on \n4  compliance with all EOs, precluding the promotion of DEI or gender ideology, or cooperation \n5  with federal immigration enforcement. For example, the High-Impact HIV Prevention and \n6  Surveillance Program statutory requirements relate not to precluding DEI and gender ideology or \n7  requiring cooperation with federal immigration but instead to recordkeeping and patient \n8  confidentiality and other activities related to health and human services. 42 U.S.C. § 247c(b)–(c). \n9  Statutory requirements for the Healthcare Providers grant program relate to promptness and \n10  continuity of primary health services, collaboration with other providers, quality improvement, \n11  financial responsibility, reimbursement, fee schedules, facility capacity, and accessibility of \n12  services—including with express reference to populations with “substantial proportion of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  individuals of limited English-speaking ability” and “medically underserved populations.” Id. § \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  254b(k)(3). Ryan White program grants have as an express statutory purpose “address[ing] the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on, and the disparities in access, treatment, care, and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities,” id. § 300ff-121(a). \nS d nr\nee 17  To establish congressional authority for its HHS Grant Conditions, the Government again \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  falls back on agency regulations, which are not a source of congressional authorization, and broad \n19  congressional authorizations of grantmaking discretion. Dkt. 40 at 33 (citing 42 C.F.R. § 52.9 \n20  (“The Secretary may… impose additional conditions… when in the Secretary’s judgment such \n21  conditions are necessary to assure or protect advancement of the approved project, the interests of \n22  the public health, or the conservation of grant funds.”); 42 U.S.C. § 300x-6(a)(7) (Community \n23  Mental Health Services Block Grants may include assurances “the Secretary determines to be \n24  necessary to carry out this subpart.”)). The Government also cites as statutory authority for the \n25  HHS Grant Conditions Sections 254b(k)(1) and 300ff-15(a) & (b) which provide that the HRSA \n26  Health Center Program and Ryan White grants “shall contain such information as the Secretary \n27  shall prescribe.” 42 U.S.C. § 254b(k)(1), 300ff-15(a) & (b) (emphasis added). However, open-\n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n22 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 23 of 38\n \n1  ended discretion to include information is not the same as discretion to create new grant \n2  conditions. \n3  The Government also argues that the HHS Grant Conditions are appropriate because the \n4  HHS Secretary is expressly authorized to require grantees to certify compliance with Title IX of \n5  the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Dkt. 40 at 33 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1682). Ironically, under \n6  current law failure to recognize an individual’s transgender status is, in fact, a violation of Title \n7  IX. See e.g., Roe v. Critchfield, 137 F.4th 912, 928 (9th Cir. 2025); Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. \n8  Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 616– 17 (4th Cir. 2020); A.C. by M.C. v. Metro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville, \n9  75 F.4th 760, 769 (7th Cir. 2023). \n10  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their APA claims that the \n11  HUD, DOT, and HHS Grant Conditions are in excess of statutory authority. \n12  iv. APA Contrary to the Constitution \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Under the APA, a court may set aside an agency action that is “contrary to constitutional \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  their claims that the Grant Conditions violate Separation of Powers as in excess of statutory \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  authority as sort forth above and the Fifth Amendment. \nS d nr\nee 17  a.

See also Williams, 553 U.S. \n23  at 304. “[A] regulation is not vague because it may at times be difficult to prove an incriminating \n24  fact but rather because it is unclear as to what fact must be proved.” F.C.C. v.

The two primary concerns with vague regulations are that “(1) \n26  they do not give a ‘person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is \n27  prohibited, so that he may act accordingly’; and (2) they encourage arbitrary and discriminatory \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n23 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 24 of 38\n \n1  enforcement by not providing explicit standards for policemen, judges, and juries.” United States \n2  v. Jae Gab Kim, 449 F.3d 933, 941–42 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108). As to \n3  the latter, “the doctrine is a corollary of the separation of powers—requiring that Congress, rather \n4  than the executive or judicial branch, define what conduct is sanctionable and what is not.” \n5  Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. 148, 156 (2018) (citing Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358, n. 7 \n6  (1983)). \n7  “[T]he degree of vagueness that the Constitution [allows] depends in part on the nature of \n8  the enactment.” Dimaya, 584 U.S. at 156 (quoting Vill. of Hoffman Ests. v. Flipside, Hoffman \n9  Ests., Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 498 (1982)). There is “greater tolerance” for vagueness in “enactments \n10  with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively \n11  less severe.” Id. at 156. The same is also true “when the Government is acting as a patron rather \n12  than as sovereign” and “awarding scholarships and grants on the basis of subjective criteria.” \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Nat’l. Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 589 (1998). However, when a vague \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  condition abuts First Amendment freedoms, “a more stringent vagueness test should apply.” Vill. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of Hoffman Ests., 455 U.S. at 499. See also Grayned, 408 U.S. at 109. This— “whether [a law] \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights” such as First Amendment \nS d nr\nee 17  rights—is “perhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands.” \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Vill. of Hoffman Est., 455 U.S. at 499. \n19  Whether facial or as-applied, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their due \n20  process challenges to the HUD, DOT, and HHS Grant Conditions. Defendants insist that \n21  “Plaintiffs bring sweeping, facial claims against the general grant conditions.” Dkt. 40 at 22. \n22  However, Plaintiffs argue that as-applied to them enforcements of the Grant Conditions are \n23  overbroad and arbitrary. For example, HUD has said that the City of Fresno’s FY2025 CDBG \n24  grants will not be approved because they are not “consistent” with the Grant Condition Executive \n25  Orders, citing parts of the plan that aim “to improve housing affordability and stability, reduce \n26  racial and economic isolation and support environmental justice and sustainability” and provide \n27  “[e]mergency shelter for all genders and their dependent children who are fleeing domestic \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n24 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 25 of 38\n \n1  violence.” Dkt. 36-15, Skei Decl (emphasis added by HUD). SAMHSA has alerted the County of \n2  Marin that it identified “costs and activities related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)” in \n3  one of its grant continuation applications and requested Marin certify compliance with certain DEI \n4  terms prohibiting spending funds on DEI activities without further defining DEI activities. Dkt. \n5  43-5, Paran Decl., ¶ 5. \n6   Further, to the extent Plaintiffs’ claims are “sweeping” as Defendants suggest, Dkt. 40 at \n7  22, it is because the Grant Conditions are sweeping. The Grant Conditions require not just that a \n8  particular grant award be used in compliance with the conditions but that each Plaintiff certify \n9  compliance across its grant awards and programs and perhaps even general operations. See e.g., \n10  Dkt. 36-22, Bacher Decl., Ex. 8 (City of Saint Paul IFAC Agreement requiring recipients to certify \n11  they “do[] not operate any programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)) (emphasis \n12  added); Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. A (April 2025 General Administrative, National, and Departmental \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Policy Requirements and Terms for HUD’s Financial Assistance Programs requiring that “[n]o \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  state or unit of general local government that receives HUD funding under [sic] may use that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  funding in a manner that…facilitates the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration…”); \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. U (HHS Grant Policy Statement revisions effective October 1, 2025 stating \nS d nr\nee 17  that “[b]y accepting federal funds from HHS, recipients certify compliance with all federal anti-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  discrimination laws and these requirements and that complying with those laws is a material \n19  condition of receive federal funding streams. Recipients are responsible for ensuring subrecipients, \n20  contractors, and partners also comply.”). Accordingly, the Grant Conditions as applied to each \n21  Plaintiff implicate the broad range of Plaintiffs’ programs.  \n22  Finally, even as facial claims, if Plaintiffs’ claims implicate First Amendment interests, the \n23  standard is not, as Defendants suggest, proving that the conditions would be unconstitutional in all \n24  applications. Rather, the standard is whether the conditions “‘reach[] a substantial amount of \n25  constitutionally protected conduct.’” California Teachers Ass’n v. State Bd. of Educ., 271 F.3d \n26  1141, 1149 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Nunez by Nunez v. City of San Diego, 114 F.3d 935, 940 \n27  (9th Cir. 1997).

Dev. v. All. for Open Socy. Intern., Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 212 \n3  (2013), and awards based on at least some “subjective criteria,” Finley, 524 U.S. at 571.  \n4  However, they also create the risk—based in some cases on Plaintiffs’ mere use of already \n5  awarded funds—of severe penalties under the FCA and perhaps even criminal prosecution. \n6  Further, “even if the government has no obligation to offer [a] benefit in the first instance,” “the \n7  government may not place a condition on the receipt of a benefit or subsidy that infringes upon the \n8  recipient’s constitutionally protected rights.” Agency for Intern. Dev., 570 U.S. at 212. See also \n9  Koala v. Khosla, 931 F.3d 887, 898 (9th Cir. 2019) (“The Speiser-Perry-Regan-Finley line of \n10  cases reflects the Supreme Court’s continued cautionary admonition that the First Amendment \n11  will not tolerate the administration of subsidy programs with a censorious purpose.”). The Grant \n12  Conditions here “threaten[] to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected [First Amendment] \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  rights,” Vill. of Hoffman Ests., 455 U.S. at 499, because, in Plaintiffs’ own words, they “leave \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiffs guessing whether previously permissible activities—such as hosting community \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  workshops, providing space for local affinity groups’ programs and events, or even just using \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  [certain words]—violate the Federal Grant Conditions,” Dkt. 36 at 35. Because vagueness here \nS d nr\nee 17  could chill Plaintiffs’ expressive activity, lesser tolerance for vagueness is warranted even though \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the conditions attach to discretionary grant awards.  \n19  As for Defendants’ reliance on National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, it is misplaced. \n20  The grant awards here, for housing, transportation, and health services, are markedly different \n21  from the highly subjective “patron[age]” in Finley. See Finley, 524 U.S. at 571. There, the \n22  National Endowment for the Arts selected artists for grants based on inherently subjective criteria \n23  such as artistic excellence and merit. See id. It did not violate due process to “merely add[] some \n24  imprecise consideration,” namely, “general standards of decency,” to that already highly \n25  subjective selection process. Id. at 590. Here, on the other hand, selection of Plaintiffs for housing, \n26  transportation, and health services grants is not nearly so subjective as selecting artists for artistic \n27  merit. As discussed above, Congress has laid out specific aims for the grant programs as well as \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n26 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 27 of 38\n \n1  specific criteria. The Grant Conditions are not “merely add[itive]” to those selection schemes—\n2  they digress from them. The vague conditions here are also different in type from those in Finley \n3  because they seem to demand that each Plaintiff certify their compliance generally across all \n4  federal grants, and so failure to satisfy a condition does not mean, as it did in Finley, loss of one \n5  grant but rather potential loss of all federal grants administered by the Defendant agency. \n6  Accordingly, the tolerance for vagueness in Finley is not warranted here. \n7  1.  Lack of Relation to Agency Expertise \n8  As noted above, that the Grant Conditions are not related to the expertise of the Defendant \n9  agencies or Congress’ intent in authorizing the grant programs also impacts Plaintiffs’ due process \n10  claims. It makes the vagueness in the Grant Conditions harder to resolve. \n11  To illustrate, it is not clear what the DOT Gender Ideology Conditions mean when applied \n12  to a grantee revitalizing shipping ports in Alameda and enforced by DOT or its operating \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  administrators whose expertise is far afield from gender ideology. See Dkt. 36-2, Decl. Ott., ¶ 6 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (Port Infrastructure Development Program - Pier and Seaplane Lagoon Repairs). While tempting, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the answer cannot be that such a condition is meaningless because Defendants have made clear \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  they will cut funding based on a failure to comply or certify compliance with these conditions. See \nS d nr\nee 17  e.g., Dkt. 36-22, Bacher Decl., Ex. 8, Appendix E (DOT IFAC agreement requiring the City of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Saint Paul to include a clause in all subcontracting contracts or agreements requiring that the \n19  subcontractor “comply” with the Gender Ideology EO); Dkt. 36-24, Ex.

EO Conditions  \n24  HUD, DOT, and HHS all have grant conditions requiring compliance with Executive \n25  Orders (collectively, “EO Grant Conditions”). See Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex.

W, Z (general terms and \n7  conditions for CDC research and non-research grants requiring recipients to “comply with…grants \n8  policy contained in… applicable Executive Orders” without designating which EOs are \n9  applicable); Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. J at 31 (April 2025 SAMHSA NOFO Application Guide \n10  requiring “[a]ll activities proposed in your application and budget narrative must be in alignment \n11  with the current Executive Orders”). \n12  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their due process challenges to the EO \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Conditions. Those conditions are impermissibly vague because they incorporate the equally vague \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  language of the EOs themselves and because in some cases they do not specify which EOs are \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “applicable to grantees” and in all cases they do not explain how the EOs are applicable to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  grantees. The EOs require agencies to terminate all “equity” or “equity-related” “actions, \nS d nr\nee 17  initiatives or programs,” Executive Order No. 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025), and “all \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  discriminatory and illegal preferences,” Executive Order No. 14173, 90 Fed.

See e.g., San Francisco Unified \n2  Sch. Dist. v. AmeriCorps, No. 25-CV-02425-EMC, 2025 WL 1713360, at *18 (N.D. Cal. June 18, \n3  2025) (“Beginning with the executive orders themselves, the relevant provisions of the underlying \n4  [DEI] executive orders incorporated into the Directive are highly ambiguous.”). Taken together \n5  the meaning of compliance with the Executive Orders is even harder to ascertain. For example, do \n6  the EO Grant Conditions require or prohibit a Plaintiff to consider certain protected classes as a \n7  proxy for immigration status in order to help ensure that immigrants do not “obtain any cash or \n8  non-cash public benefit”? See Executive Order No. 14218, 90 Fed. Reg. 10581 (Feb. 19, 2025). \n9  Even if violation of the EO Grant Conditions could be defined, it is not clear what \n10  compliance with the EOs requires of Plaintiffs. This is especially true since Executive Orders bind \n11  only executive agencies, officers, and employees—not private parties or local governments—and \n12  many of the EOs are directed at agency heads. For example, is genuine ignorance a viable excuse \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  for non-compliance? If not, what is Plaintiffs’ responsibility? How extensively and frequently \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  must Plaintiffs audit their programs and subrecipients to be in compliance? Upon discovering a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  condition violation, what is sufficient to resolve the violation and how quickly must Plaintiffs act? \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Since the EO Grant Conditions leave it “unclear as to what fact[s] must be proved” to \nS d nr\nee 17  comply while Defendants make clear their intent to “vigorously enforce” them, Plaintiffs are likely \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to succeed on the merits of their claims that the EO Grant Conditions are impermissibly vague \n19  under the Fifth Amendment.

Supp. 3d 53, 66–67 (D.D.C. \n5  2025); San Francisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01824-JST, ––– F.Supp.3d ––––, \n6  2025 WL 1621636 (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2025)). Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \n7  due process claims as to the HUD and HHS DEI Conditions. \n8  In the case of the DOT DEI Conditions, additional guidance was given. The Duffy Letter \n9  explains that DOT recipients are prohibited from allocating funds “based on race, color, national \n10  origin, sex or religion,” and “establish[ing], induc[ing], or endors[ing] prohibited discrimination \n11  indirectly.” Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. P. Discrimination, as defined in the letter, must “not exist in \n12  programs or activities [DOT] funds or financially assists.” Id.  This discrimination includes “any \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  policy, program, or activity” “[w]hether or not described in neutral terms” “that is premised on a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  prohibited classification, including discriminatory policies or practices designed to achieve so-\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  called ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion,’ or ‘DEI,’ goals.’” Id. Additionally, “[r]ecipients of DOT \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  financial assistance must ensure that the personnel practices (including hiring, promotions, and \nS d nr\nee 17  terminations) within their organizations are merit-based and do not discriminate on prohibited \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  categories.” Id. While the Duffy Letter provides more guidance to Plaintiffs, it is still \n19  impermissibly vague. In light of the recent shifting federal anti-discrimination law and the letter’s \n20  vague prohibition against grantees “establish[ing], induc[ing], or endors[ing] prohibited \n21  discrimination indirectly,” Plaintiffs do not have sufficient notice of what is required of them to \n22  comply with the DOT DEI Conditions. \n23  In sum, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their due process claims with regard to the HUD, \n24  DOT, and HHS DEI Conditions. \n25  4.  Gender Ideology Conditions \n26    HUD, DOT, and HHS require Plaintiffs to certify that they do not “promote” “gender \n27  ideology.” See e.g., Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. Q (Letter on behalf of HUD Secretary Scott Turner \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n31 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 32 of 38\n \n1  explaining that grant agreement “conformity means that a grantee…shall not use grant funds to \n2  promote ‘gender ideology,’ as defined in [the Gender Ideology EO]”); Dkt. 36-6, Warhuus Decl., \n3  Ex. A. (CoC grant recipients must “not use grant funds to promote ‘gender ideology’ as defined in \n4  [the Gender Ideology EO].”); Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. E (FHWA competitive grant recipients must \n5  certify that they comply with the Gender Ideology E.O.); Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Ex. V (HHS Grant \n6  Policy Statement revisions effective October 1, 2025 require certification of compliance with the \n7  Gender Ideology EO.). Even if the meaning of gender ideology is sufficiently clear as at least one \n8  court has suggested, what constitutes impermissible “promot[ion]” by Plaintiffs is not. See San \n9  Francisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01824-JST, at *22–23 (rejecting due process \n10  challenges to gender ideology conditions because “the Gender [Ideology Executive] Order \n11  provides a definition of the key phrase ‘gender ideology’ and plaintiffs there clearly ascertained in \n12  their EPC challenge that it “stands in opposition to the principle that persons can identify as other \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  than strictly male or female, or that persons may have a gender identity different from their \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  biological sex as classified at birth”). The Gender Ideology Executive Order states that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or \n sir\netatS detsiD nre 1167   oaontthhdee srr  himnalteles rcsneaaaglse eas n.i sd As uegxientnegrc nsyua fcl ohmr msetsasst atehgmaetes nr tethsqa,u tp iproerl oiacmnie oisnt,e dr ieovgri udolutahateilo’rswn ssi,es exfo  isrnhmcausll,l  cclaiostmte  mgmeaunlned ieocrra  itfdieoemnosal oloegr,y  , \nth\nintr and shall not request gender identity.  Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted \nUo\nN 18  by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. \n19  Section 3(e). In addition, \n20 \nFederal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.  Each agency shall assess \ngrant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender \n21 \nideology. \n22 \nSection 3(g). As discussed above, since the Executive Orders make directives to agency heads, the \n23 \nGender Ideology Conditions are impermissibly vague as to what is required of Plaintiffs. For \n24 \nexample, it is not clear whether reference in the Gender Ideology Grant Conditions to the Gender \n25 \nIdeology EO means that the directive to agency heads that they stop using forms that allow a \n26 \nperson to list something other than male or female now applies to Plaintiffs. As another example, \n27 \nit is not clear whether HHS programming designed for individuals using hormone therapies for \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n32 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 33 of 38\n \n1  gender dysphoria would constitute promotion of gender ideology. See U.S. v. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. \n2  1816, 1829 (2025) (Prohibitions on administering puberty blockers or hormones to treat gender \n3  dysphoria, identity disorder, or incongruence classify based on medical use of hormone and not \n4  sex.). In short, the HUD, DOT, and HHS Gender Ideology Conditions do not provide Plaintiffs \n5  with sufficient guidance, and Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their vagueness \n6  challenges as to these conditions. \n7  5.  Elective Abortion Condition \n8  HUD requires that grant recipients shall “not use any Grant Funds to fund or promote \n9  elective abortions, as required by [the Elective Abortion EO].” See Dkt. 36-6, Warhuus Decl., Ex. \n10  A.  However, it is not clear what constitutes elective abortion even with reference to the Hyde \n11  Amendment because the Elective Abortion EO suggests the Hyde Amendment prohibits elective \n12  abortion in all cases when in fact its prohibition expressly excludes cases of rape, incest, and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  where the life of the mother is at risk. See Executive Order No. 14182, 90 Fed. Reg. 8751 (Jan. 31, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2025); Pub. L. No. 118-47, § 810, 138 Stat. 591 (2024). Nor is it clear what “promotion” means. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  For example, the language does not give Plaintiffs notice as to whether housing an individual \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  before or after an elective abortion would violate the condition and allows HUD arbitrarily to \nS d nr\nee 17  enforce the condition against Plaintiffs as it sees fit. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  on the merits of this claim. \n19  6.  Immigration Enforcement Conditions \n20  HUD, DOT, and HHS require grant recipients to cooperate with federal immigration \n21  enforcement while using language such as recipients must “cooperat[e] with and not imped[e] \n22  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other Federal offices and components of \n23  the Department of Homeland Security in the enforcement of Federal immigration law,” Dkt. 36-\n24  24, RJN, Ex. P; recipients must not “facilitate[] the subsidization or promotion of illegal \n25  immigration or abet[] policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation,” id., Ex. A; and \n26  “[f]unds cannot be used to support or provide services, either directly or indirectly, to removable \n27  or illegal aliens,” id., Ex. J at 31. See also Dkt. 36-22, Bacher Decl., Ex. 8; Dkt. 36-24, RJN, Exs. \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n33 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 34 of 38\n \n1  E, R, S, T. By the same logic already discussed the Immigration Enforcement Conditions are \n2  impermissibly vague because they do not give Plaintiffs notice as to what “cooperation with” or \n3  “not impeding” immigration enforcement or not “subsidizing,” “supporting,” or “promoting” \n4  immigrants require of Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of these claims. \n5  ii.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm If the Conditions Are Not Enjoined \n6  A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that it is likely to suffer \n7  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. Such harm “is \n8  traditionally defined as harm for which there is no adequate legal remedy, such as an award of \n9  damages.” Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Rent–\n10  A–Ctr., Inc. v. Canyon Television & Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir. 1991)). \n11  Plaintiffs here must choose between attempting compliance with unlawful conditions or \n12  forgoing millions of dollars of key federal grant funding. This choice causes irreparable harm \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  because the Grant Conditions likely violate Separation of Powers as in excess of statutory \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  authority and Due Process as impermissibly vague, and “deprivation of constitutional rights \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  ‘unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’” Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 994 (9th \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Cir. 2017). Even if Plaintiffs chose to try to comply with the Grant Conditions, their grants might \nS d nr\nee 17  be withdrawn or blocked or reimbursement denied. This uncertainty as to whether the Defendant \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  agencies will consider conditions satisfied creates irreparable injury not just in the form of \n19  constitutional injury. “The []uncertainty [also] interferes with [Plaintiffs’] ability to budget, plan \n20  for the future, and properly serve their residents” and requires “placing funds in reserve and \n21  making cuts to services” which constitutes irreparable harm. See Cnty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, \n22  250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 537 (N.D. Cal. 2017). This disruption cannot be remedied down the line with \n23  money alone as Defendants contend because by then projects on which millions of taxpayer \n24  dollars have already been spent, and which require years to complete and coordination across \n25  many parties, will have been compromised. Plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated a likelihood \n26  of irreparable injury with regard to their claims regarding the HUD, DOT, and HHS Grant \n27  Conditions in the form of constitutional injury and budgetary uncertainty. \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n34 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 35 of 38\n \n1  iii.  Balance of Equities and Public Interest \n2  A party seeking a preliminary injunction must “establish ... that the balance of equities tips \n3  in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. When the \n4  federal government is a party as here, these factors merge. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435. \n5  Here, the public interest is served by giving Plaintiffs the budgetary clarity needed to deliver key \n6  public services to their constituents.  Further, “it is always in the public interest to prevent the \n7  violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n8  2012) (cleaned up). \n9  The Government relies on Department of Educ. v. California to argue these merged factors \n10  tip in their favor. See Dkt. 40 at 37 (citing Dep’t of Educ., 604 U.S. 650 (2025)). However, \n11  Department of Education v. California is fundamentally different from the present case for two \n12  reasons. First, plaintiffs there sought injunctive relief based on APA arbitrary and capricious and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  APA contrary to law claims whereas here there are also serious constitutional concerns. See \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 769 F. Supp. 3d 72, 78 (D. Mass. 2025), appeal dismissed sub \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  nom. California v. US Dep’t of Educ., No. 25-1244, 2025 WL 2604596 (1st Cir. Apr. 23, 2025). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Second, the public interest at stake is a matter not just of “financial wherewithal to keep \nS d nr\nee 17  []programs running” but also clarity in governance. Dep’t of Educ, 604 U.S. at 652. What is the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  federal government requiring and what choices do Plaintiffs, almost all of whom are local \n19  governments, need to make? As for Defendants’ concerns about recoupment of government funds, \n20  these concerns cut both ways since Plaintiffs may be forced to divert and spend unplanned sources \n21  of public money to keep afloat projects that the Grant Conditions jeopardize. In fact, since \n22  Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, this concern cuts in their favor. The \n23  balance of harms weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor, and preliminary injunction is in the public interest. \n24  V. SCOPE OF REMEDY AND ORDER \n25  Emergency injunctive relief should not provide “a remedy beyond what [i]s necessary to \n26  provide relief” to the injured parties. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 360 (1996). Accordingly, the \n27  injunction here covers the Grant Conditions only to the extent they make requirements of \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n35 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 36 of 38\n \n1  Plaintiffs beyond what is required by current federal law. It is necessary, however, for the \n2  injunction to enjoin each Defendant from enforcing the Grant Conditions against any Plaintiff who \n3  is a grantee of the Defendant. To require instead, as the Government requests, that each Plaintiff \n4  specifically identify every grant which may be implicated is backwards because Plaintiffs are \n5  injured specifically by the uncertainty and broadness of the Grant Conditions’ meaning and reach. \n6  For the foregoing reasons and for good cause shown, the Court hereby ORDERS that as to \n7  the Plaintiffs only: \n8  (1) HUD, DOT and their operating administrators, and HHS and their officers, agents, \n9  servants, employees, and attorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert \n10  or participation with them (collectively “Enjoined Parties”), are enjoined from, as \n11  to the Plaintiffs, (1) imposing or enforcing the Grant Conditions, as defined above, \n12  or any materially similar terms or conditions with respect to any grants awarded to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs; (2) requiring the Plaintiffs to make any “certification” or other \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  representation related to compliance with such terms or conditions; or (3) refusing \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  to issue, process, or sign grant agreements based on Plaintiffs’ participation in this \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  lawsuit. \nS d nr\nee 17  (2) The Enjoined Parties shall immediately take every step necessary to effectuate this \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  order, including clearing any administrative, operational, or technical hurdles. \n19  (3) By the second day after entry of this Order, Enjoined Parties shall serve and file a \n20  declaration(s) verifying that (1) Plaintiffs are not subject to the Grant Conditions \n21  and (2) they have complied with this Order, including serving a copy of this order \n22  on every defendant agency head, and detailing what additional steps, if any, they \n23  have taken to comply. \n24  (4) The preliminary injunction shall remain in effect pending further orders from this \n25  Court. \n26  (5) By September 29, 2025, Plaintiffs shall post a nominal bond of $100 with the Clerk \n27  of the Court.  \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n36 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 37 of 38\n \n1  VI. REQUEST FOR SECURITY AND A STAY \n2  Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a district court “may issue \n3  a preliminary injunction only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers \n4  proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully \n5  enjoined or restrained.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). The district court retains discretion “as to the \n6  amount of security required, if any.” Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1086 (9th Cir. 2009) \n7  (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Since Defendants have indicated previously that \n8  they are willing to wait to enforce the conditions, Defendants have not made a particular showing \n9  as to their risk of non-repayment, and Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims \n10  as to HUD, DOT, and HHS, preliminary injunction is not likely to pose any harm to Defendants. \n11  Further, a bond would deprive Plaintiffs and the public they serve of the very funds the \n12  preliminary injunction seeks to protect. Accordingly, Plaintiffs shall be required to pay only a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  nominal bond of $100. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  As for Defendants’ request for a stay, a stay is not appropriate because Plaintiffs are likely \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  to succeed on the merits of their claims, see Manrique v. Kolc, 65 F.4th 1037, 1040 (9th Cir. 2023) \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (citing Nken, 556 U.S. at 434), and Defendants have not carried their burden of showing that they \nS d nr\nee 17  are likely to face “irreparable injury… during the period before the appeal is decided,” see Doe #1 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  v. Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, 1058–59 (9th Cir. 2020). Accordingly, Defendants’ request for a stay is \n19  denied. \n   \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO.  25-cv-07070-RS \n37 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 45     Filed 09/23/25     Page 38 of 38\n \n1  VII.

INTRODUCTION \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiffs, local government entities and a public benefit corporation that receive hundreds \nS d nr\nee 17  of millions of dollars of congressionally authorized grant money, bring this Motion for a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Temporary Restraining Order to enjoin Defendants, agencies and their operating administrators, \n19  from using seemingly unauthorized and vague funding conditions to enforce compliance with \n20  recent Executive Orders. While the Executive may announce its policy priorities to agencies, “[a]n \n21  agency literally has no power to act… unless and until Congress confers power upon it.” La. Pub. \n22  Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986). Yet, Defendants have announced grant \n23  conditions embracing the Administration’s recent Executive Orders requiring grantees to certify \n24  they prohibit DEI programs, prohibit promotion of gender ideology and elective abortion, and \n25  promote federal immigration enforcement efforts. Plaintiffs contend that these grant conditions \n26  violate the Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, the Fifth \n27  Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). \n28  The temporary restraining order (TRO) requested by Plaintiffs is granted as described \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 28     Filed 08/27/25     Page 2 of 14\n \n1  below. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of at least some of their claims, and the \n2  irreparable harm that plaintiffs will suffer in the absence of injunctive relief outweighs any burden \n3  placed on the government by this temporary pause. In the context of a dynamic situation, the \n4  temporary order seeks to preserve the status quo and protect the power of the legislative branch. \n5  II. BACKGROUND \n6  Between January and August 2025 President Trump issued a series of Executive Orders \n7  directing executive agencies to impose new conditions on federal grants (collectively, the “Grant \n8  Condition Executive Orders”). Exec. Order No. 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Ending \n9  Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing); Exec. Order No. 14168, 90 \n10  Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 30, 2025) (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and \n11  Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government); Exec. Order No. 14173, 90 Fed. Reg. \n12  8633 (Jan. 31, 2025) (Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity); \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Exec. Order No. 14182, 90 Fed. Reg. 8751 (Jan. 31, 2025) (Enforcing the Hyde Amendment); \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Exec. Order No. 14332, 90 Fed. Reg. 38929 (Aug. 12, 2025) (Improving Oversight of Federal \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Grantmaking). Taking heed, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), including the Federal Transit Administration \nS d nr\nee 17  (FTA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection \n19  Agency (EPA) have announced new grant conditions requiring compliance with the Executive \n20  Orders. These conditions have been announced through revised grant terms and conditions, \n21  templates, assurance forms, certification forms, memoranda, policy statements, and letters. The \n22  grant conditions obligate grantees to certify that they do not operate any DEI programs, do not \n23  “promote” “gender ideology” or “elective abortion,” are required to cooperate with federal \n24  immigration enforcements, and are liable for non-compliance under the False Claims Act. \n25  The latest Executive Order, Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking, was issued on \n26  August 7, 2025. It reinforced the previous Executive Orders by requiring that discretionary grant \n27  awards “demonstrably advance the President’s policy priorities” and are “not[] used to fund, \n28  ORDER GRANTING TRO \nCASE NO.  3:25-CV-07070 \n2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 28     Filed 08/27/25     Page 3 of 14\n \n1  promote, encourage, subsidize, or facilitate” “racial preferences or other forms of racial \n2  discrimination by the grant recipient,” “denial by the grant recipient of the sex binary in humans or \n3  the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic,” “illegal immigration,” or other “anti-\n4  American values.” Exec.

Reg. 38929 (Aug. 12, 2025) (Improving \n5  Oversight of Federal Grantmaking). \n6  Then, on or around August 18, 2025, the City of Fresno received an email from HUD \n7  stating “that the Department is questioning the accuracy of the City of Fresno’s certification that \n8  the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds described in its Fiscal Year 2025 \n9  Consolidated Plan/Action Plan (the Plan) will be administered in conformity with applicable laws, \n10  including Executive Orders.” Dkt. 9-35, Ex.

HUD directed the City to remove or replace all \n11  references to “equity,” “environmental justice,” “transgender” in the Plan; agree not to “promote \n12  ‘gender ideology,’ as defined in Executive Order (E.O.) 14168[;]” and agree that “its \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  compliance… with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the U.S. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Government’s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Code”—which imposes liability for material misrepresentations affecting applicable government \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  payment decisions—by 12:00 pm EDT Thursday, August 21, 2025.

Grant Conditions”). The E.O. Grant Conditions jeopardize these funds \n25  because to receive them Plaintiffs must certify compliance with potentially unconstitutional and \n26  vague conditions and risk liability under the False Claims Act. This implicates not only grants \n27  already awarded, which in some cases are forfeited if not promptly used, but also the grants \n28  ORDER GRANTING TRO \nCASE NO.  3:25-CV-07070 \n3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 28     Filed 08/27/25     Page 4 of 14\n \n1  Plaintiffs normally apply for and receive on a continuous basis.

LEGAL STANDARD \n4  A party may seek a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo and prevent \n5  irreparable harm until a preliminary injunction hearing may be held. Reno Air Racing Ass’n, Inc. \n6  v. McCord, 452 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2006) (citing Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Brotherhood \n7  of Teamsters (“Granny Goose”), 415 U.S. 423, 438-39 (1974)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b). The \n8  standard for issuing a temporary restraining order mirrors that for issuing a preliminary injunction. \n9  See Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1159 n.3 (9th Cir. 2017). “A plaintiff seeking [such \n10  relief] must establish that [1] he is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer \n11  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his \n12  favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). In the Ninth Circuit, a sliding scale may be used at the preliminary \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  injunction stage: “if a plaintiff can only show that there are ‘serious questions going to the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  merits’—a lesser showing than likelihood of success on the merits—then a preliminary injunction \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  may still issue if the ‘balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor and the other two \nS d nr\nee 17  Winter factors are satisfied.’” All. for the Wild Rockies v. Peña, 865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2017) (quoting Shell Offshore, Inc. v. Greenpeace, Inc., 709 F.3d 1281, 1291 (9th Cir. 2013)). The \n19  “TRO ‘should be restricted to… preserving the status quo and preventing irreparable harm just so \n20  long as is necessary to hold a [preliminary injunction] hearing and no longer.’” E. Bay Sanctuary \n21  Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 779 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Granny Goose, 415 U.S. at 439). \n22  IV. DISCUSSION \n23  The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action. Contrary to the \n24  Government’s assertions, this is not a contract dispute in which Plaintiffs seek money damages \n25  such that their suit belongs before the Federal Court of Claims. See United Aeronautical Corp. v. \nUnited States Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 2023) (“If rights and remedies are \n26 \nstatutorily or constitutionally based, then districts courts have jurisdiction; if rights and remedies \n27 \n28  ORDER GRANTING TRO \nCASE NO.  3:25-CV-07070 \n4 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 28     Filed 08/27/25     Page 5 of 14\n \n1  are contractually based then only the Court of Federal Claims does[.]”).1 \n2  The Government also argues that the E.O. Grant Conditions are not final agency action as \n3  required by the APA for judicial review, 5 U.S.C. § 704, but “finality[] must be interpreted in a \npragmatic and flexible manner,” Oregon Nat. Desert Ass’n v. U.S. Forest Serv. (“Oregon Nat. \n4 \nDesert”), 465 F.3d 977, 982 (9th Cir. 2006) (cleaned up). The E.O. Grant Conditions are \n5 \nreviewable here as final agency action: they “take[] ‘definitive’ legal position[s]” that the \n6 \nExecutive Orders and Executive Grant Conditions are enforceable against Plaintiffs; this position \n7 \nposes an “immediate and significant practical burden” on Plaintiffs; and “the disputed [legal] \n8 \nauthority underlying the [positions are] fully fit for judicial review[.]” See CSI Aviation Servs., \n9 \nInc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 637 F.3d 408, 412, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Ciba–Geigy Corp. \n10 \nv. EPA, 801 F.2d 430, 436 (D.C.Cir.1986)). See also Oregon Nat.

Grant Conditions as directives that soon will \n23  be enforced—despite the strong possibility that they are unauthorized—and thus pose direct and \n24  imminent threats to Plaintiffs’ funding. \n25  ii.  Ripeness \nFor purposes of ripeness the Ninth Circuit uses three factors to “evaluat[e] the genuineness \n26 \nof a claimed threat of prosecution”: “(1) ‘whether the plaintiffs have articulated a concrete plan to \n27 \n28  ORDER GRANTING TRO \nCASE NO.  3:25-CV-07070 \n6 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 28     Filed 08/27/25     Page 7 of 14\n \n1  violate the law in question’; (2) ‘whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a specific \n2  warning or threat to initiate proceedings’; and (3) ‘the history of past prosecution or enforcement \n3  under the challenged statute.’” San Francisco I, 897 F.3d at 1236 (cleaned up). \n  As to the first and second, the latest Executive Order issued on August 7, 2025 is a \n4 \nrenewed directive to agencies to condition grant funding that has already spurred specific agency \n5 \nwarnings. Last week HUD threatened to cut-off some of the City of Fresno’s funding if its \n6 \ndemands were not met, and as of 12:00 pm EDT August 21, 2025 the City had failed to comply \n7 \nwith those demands. HUD provided that “failure to address HUD’s concerns regarding the \n8 \ncertification may result in HUD determining that the certification is inaccurate or unsatisfactory, \n9 \nwhich will result in disapproval of the [City’s Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated] Plan.” Dkt. 9-35, \n10 \nEx.

See also 5 U.S.C. § 706 (Courts must “decide all relevant \n8  questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or \n9  applicability of the terms of an agency action.”). \n10  Plaintiffs have shown serious questions as to whether the E.O.

In fact, they have shown that in many cases the conditions squarely \n12  contradict the congressional acts that establish the grant programs in the first instance.

For example, Executive Order \n7  14173 Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity directs each federal \n8  agency head to require each grant recipient to “certify that it does not operate any programs \n9  promoting DEI” that would violate federal antidiscrimination laws. Exec. Order 14173 § \n10  3(b)(iv)(B), 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 31, 2025) (emphasis added).

Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Rent–\nuoro 13 \nC tfila A–Ctr., Inc. v. Canyon Television & Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir. 1991)). \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo Plaintiffs must choose between certifying compliance with likely unconstitutional \niD tc 15 \n sir conditions or forgoing key federal grant funding.6 Choosing the former not only causes irreparable \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr  \nee 17 \ntinhtr 4 Federal agencies’ own regulations regarding these grants often conflict with their new \nUoN 18  conditions. See e.g., 49 C.F.R. Part 26 (requiring Disadvantaged Business Enterprise programs); \n49 C.F.R. Part 23 (requiring disadvantaged businesses receive equitable access to airport \n19  concession contracts); 24 C.F.R. § 5.106(b)–(c) (requiring “[e]qual access to CPD programs, \nshelters, other buildings and facilities, benefits, services, and accommodations [be] provided to an \n20  individual in accordance with the individual’s gender identity, and in a manner that affords equal \naccess to the individual’s family,” including facilities with “shared sleeping quarters or shared \n21  bathing facilities”). \n22  5 For example, the E.O. Grant Conditions demand compliance with federal anti-discrimination \nlaws while the E.O.s, statements from executive department heads, and the actual enforcement of \n23  the E.O. Grant Conditions against Plaintiffs shows Defendants are broadly interpreting the law to \nprohibit essentially all DEI programs contrary to previous rulings. See e.g., Dkt. 9-18 (Letter from \n24  Sean Duffy, DOT Secretary, to All Recipients of DOT Funding (April 24, 2025)) (announcing that \nDOT interprets federal nondiscrimination law to presumptively prohibit “any policy, program, or \n25  activity that” —even if “described in neutral terms”—“is premised on a prohibited classification, \nincluding discriminatory policies or practices designed to achieve so-called [DEI] goals.”). \n26 \n6 Plaintiffs’ need to budget and plan is not abstract or distant. According to Plaintiffs, the City of \n27  Fresno had to certify compliance with HUD’s grant conditions by August 20, 2021 or risk losing \nfunding for its Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated Plan/Action Plan, Dkt. 9-35, Ex. A, and it must \n28  ORDER GRANTING TRO \nCASE NO.  3:25-CV-07070 \n11 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 28     Filed 08/27/25     Page 12 of 14\n \n1  injury because “deprivation of constitutional rights ‘unquestionably constitutes irreparable \n2  injury,’” Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 994 (9th Cir. 2017), but also because the ambiguity \n3  of the conditions, as discussed above, creates uncertainty as to whether the Defendant agencies \nwill consider the conditions satisfied. In other words, even if Plaintiffs choose to certify and \n4 \nattempt compliance with the conditions, they risk liability under the False Claims Act and more \n5 \nimportantly the possibility that their grants will be withdrawn or blocked. This budgetary \n6 \n“uncertainty” causes irreparable harm by “interfere[ing] with [Plaintiffs’] ability to budget, plan \n7 \nfor the future, and properly serve their residents,” and requires “placing funds in reserve and \n8 \nmaking cuts to services.” See Cnty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 537 (N.D. Cal. \n9 \n2017). \n10 \nd. Balance of Equities and Public Interest \n11 \nA party seeking a preliminary injunction must “establish ... that the balance of equities tips \n12 \na \ntr in in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. When the \nuoro 13 \nC tfila federal government is a party, these factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435. “[T]he \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo legal standards applicable to TROs and preliminary injunctions are “substantially identical.” \niD tc 15 \n seirt Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d at 1159 n.3. \ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr Here, the public interest is served by allowing the Plaintiffs clarity about their budgets and \nee 17 \nth\nintr programmatic capacities which provide key services to the public. Plaintiffs have a strong interest \nUo\nN 18 \nin avoiding unconstitutional federal enforcement and significant budget uncertainty.7 \n19 \n \n20 \nexecute an FAA grant agreement with Fresno by August 29, 2025, Dkt. 9-33 (Partida Delgado \n21  Decl.) ¶ 14, and a Brownfields and Land Revitalization revolving loan fund grant agreement by \nAugust 26, 2025, Dkt. 9-26 (Clark Decl.) ¶ 9; Monroe County is subject to seven FAA FY 2025 \n22  grant agreement deadlines on August 27, 28, and 29, 2025, Dkt. 9-31 (Moore Decl.) ¶ 10; the City \nof South Lake Tahoe must execute its FAA grant agreement by September 16, 2025, Dkt. 9-28 \n23  (Dickinson Decl.) ¶ 13–14; and the City of Fresno must apply for and receive reimbursement for \nmillions of dollars in FAA funding already spent in reliance on the availability of reimbursement, \n24  Dkt. 9-34 (Partida Delgado Decl.) ¶ 7–10. While at oral argument the Government suggested the \nopportunity to contest the grant conditions through dispute processes, which would render the \n25  matter no longer urgent, the description is too indefinite a basis on which Plaintiffs can rely. \n26  7 The Government argues that public interest suffers “substantial harm” by an “injunction \ninterfering with the President’s priorities” but also insists that there is “no immediate threat of… \n27  having federal funding terminated” and points to various instances where an agency has “not taken \nany action to pause or terminate grants.” There can be no substantial harm in temporarily \n28  ORDER GRANTING TRO \nCASE NO.  3:25-CV-07070 \n12 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 28     Filed 08/27/25     Page 13 of 14\n \n1  D.  SCOPE OF REMEDY AND ORDER \n2  For the foregoing reasons and for good cause shown, the Court hereby ORDERS that as to \n3  the Plaintiffs only: \n4  (1) HUD, DOT and their operating administrators, HHS, and the EPA and their \n5  officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and any other persons who are \n6  in active concert or participation with them (collectively “Enjoined Parties”), are \nenjoined from, as to the Plaintiffs, (1) imposing or enforcing the E.O. Grant \n7 \nConditions, as defined above, or any materially similar terms or conditions with \n8 \nrespect to any grants awarded to Plaintiffs; (2) rescinding, withholding, cancelling, \n9 \nor otherwise not processing grant agreements, or pausing, freezing, impeding, \n10 \nblocking, cancelling, terminating, delaying, withholding, or conditioning funds \n11 \nbased on such terms or conditions enjoined by this Order, including without \n12 \na \ntr in limitation failing or refusing to process and otherwise implement grants signed with \nuoro 13 \nC tfila changes or other objections to conditions enjoined by this Order; (3) requiring the \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo Plaintiffs to make any “certification” or other representation related to compliance \niD tc 15 \n sir with such terms or conditions; or (4) refusing to issue process, or sign grant \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr agreements based on Plaintiffs’ participation in this lawsuit. \nee 17 \nth\nintr (2) The Enjoined Parties shall immediately treat any actions taken to implement or \nUo\nN 18 \nenforce the E.O. Grant Conditions or any materially similar terms or conditions as \n19 \nto the Plaintiffs, including any delays or withholding of funds based on such \n20 \nconditions, as null, void, and rescinded. \n21 \n(3) The Enjoined Parties shall immediately take every step necessary to effectuate this \n22 \norder, including clearing any administrative, operational, or technical hurdles to \n23  implementation. \n24  (4) By August 28, 2025, Enjoined Parties shall serve and file a declaration(s) verifying \n25 \n \n26 \nenjoining threats and conduct the Government suggests it does not intend to pursue in the near \n27  term. \n28  ORDER GRANTING TRO \nCASE NO.  3:25-CV-07070 \n13 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07070-RS     Document 28     Filed 08/27/25     Page 14 of 14\n \n1  that they have complied with this Order, including serving a copy of this order on \n2  every defendant agency head, and detailing what additional steps, if any, they have \n3  taken to comply. \nTo afford time for the parties to provide complete briefing and in light of the complexity of \n4 \nthe issues raised, good cause exists to extend the TRO an additional fourteen days beyond the \n5 \ninitial fourteen-day period. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2). Accordingly, this restraining order shall \n6 \nremain in place until September 23, 2025 pending further order of this Court. \n7 \nE.  SECURITY \n8 \nRule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a district court “may issue \n9 \na preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an \n10 \namount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found \n11 \nto have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). The district court retains \n12 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  discretion “as to the amount of security required, if any.” Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, \nCfi\n tclaC 14  1086 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The district court may \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  dispense with the filing of a bond when it concludes there is no realistic likelihood of harm to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  defendant from enjoining his or her conduct.” Id. (cleaned up). \nS d nr Here, Defendants have not demonstrated that they will suffer any material harm from the \nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo injunction the Court issues today. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants’ requests for a bond. \nN 18 \nF.
