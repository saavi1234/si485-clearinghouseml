          "description": "MINUTE ORDER granting 24 Motion for Leave to File Sur-Reply: Plaintiff moves to file a sur-reply in further support of her 2 Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. The Government does not oppose this motion. Though sur-replies are generally disfavored, the decision whether to grant leave is committed to the Court's discretion, and courts typically grant leave if the moving party shows the need to contest matters presented to the Court for the first time in the non-movant's reply brief. See, e.g., Ben-Kotel v. Howard Univ., 319 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2003). In her Motion for Leave, Plaintiff references the need to contest new arguments raised by the Government in their 23 Supplemental Memorandum and to discuss new decisions issued by the D.C. Circuit and the District of Massachusetts that are relevant to this case. Because of the importance of the issues of first impression involved in this case, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply. The Court further observes that the briefing at issue relates to Plaintiff's motion, which means that Plaintiff should usually get the last word. The Court permitted the Government the opportunity to file a 23 Supplemental Memorandum in addition to its 13 Response in order to ensure that it had sufficient opportunity to present their arguments given the short timeframe. Signed by Judge Jia M. Cobb on September 9, 2025. (lcjmc1)"

    "summary": "<p>This case challenges President Donald J. Trump&rsquo;s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook. On August 15, 2025, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte sent a referral letter to the Department of Justice accusing Cook of mortgage fraud related to her 2021 loan applications (prior to her Senate confirmation). On August 20, 2025, Director Pulte publicly released the referral letter, and within 30 minutes, President Trump demanded Cook&rsquo;s resignation on social media. Two days later, on August 22, 2025, President Trump told reporters he would fire Cook if she did not resign. On August 25, 2025, President Trump posted a <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/letter-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-notifying-her-her-dismissal-from-office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a> on Truth Social purporting to fire Governor Cook &ldquo;effective immediately,&rdquo; without providing her prior notice or an opportunity to respond.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cook responded with this lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on August 28, 2025, by private lawyers and the Democracy Defenders Fund. Her complaint asserts that President Trump&rsquo;s action violates the Federal Reserve Act (FRA), which permits removal of Board members only &ldquo;for cause.&rdquo; The complaint contends that the unsubstantiated, pre-confirmation mortgage allegations do not meet this standard, rendering the President&rsquo;s actions unlawful. It further alleges that Governor Cook was denied her statutory right to notice and a hearing under the FRA, as well as her Fifth Amendment due process rights, because she was deprived of her property interest in her position without any process. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm Cook&rsquo;s continued status as a Board member, prevent enforcement of her removal, and uphold the independence of the Federal Reserve. She simultaneously sought a temporary restraining order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Jia Cobb, who set a hearing for August 29, 2025. Play-by-play on that hearing is <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/what-happened-during-fed-governor-cook-s-hearing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. Judge Cobb granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, requiring on September 10, 2025, that Cook remain a member of the Federal Reserve Board for the duration of the litigation. President Trump appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia that same day.</p>",

On August 20, 2025, President Trump demanded Dr. Cookโs resignation and then announced her immediate removal online without giving her notice or a chance to respond. Cook sued, arguing her firing violated the Federal Reserve Act, which only allows Board members to be removed โfor cause,โ and argued that unproven accusations from before her confirmation arenโt enough. She also said her due process rights were denied. The U.S. District Court ruled on August 29, 2025, that Cook could stay on the Board while the case continued, and denied President Trumpโs request to stay the holding pending appeal. The Supreme Court scheduled a hearing on President Trump's application for a stay in January 2026.",

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 1 of 49\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n       \nLISA D. COOK, in her official capacity as a   \nmember of the Board of Governors of the Federal   \nReserve System and her personal capacity,   \n   \nPlaintiff,  Case No. 25-cv-2903 (JMC) \n   \nv.   \n   \nDONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as \nPresident of the United States, et al.,  \n   \nDefendants. \n  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThe Federal Reserve Act provides that the President may only remove a member of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System โfor cause.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. This case \ninvolves the first purported โfor causeโ removal of a Board Governor in the Federal Reserveโs \n111-year history. Plaintiff Lisa D. Cook brought this action against Defendant Donald J. Trump, \nin his official capacity as President of the United States, challenging the Presidentโs decision to \nremove her โfor causeโ from the Board of Governors. ECF 1. Cook also sues Jerome H. Powell, \nin his official capacity as Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Id. In \naddition, she sues the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a whole and each \nmember in their official capacity. Id.  \nBefore the Court is Cookโs motion for a temporary restraining order preventing Defendants \nfrom removing her from her position as a member of the Board. ECF 2. President Trumpโs actions \nand Cookโs resulting legal challenge raise many serious questions of first impression that the Court \nbelieves  will  benefit  from  further  briefing  on  a  non-emergency  timeline.  However,  at  this \npreliminary stage, the Court finds that Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 2 of 49\nwas done in violation of the Federal Reserve Actโs โfor causeโ provision. The best reading of the \nโfor causeโ provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the Board of Governors are \nlimited to grounds concerning a Governorโs behavior in office and whether they have been \nfaithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties. โFor causeโ thus does not contemplate \nremoving an individual purely for conduct that occurred before they began in office. In addition, \nthe Court finds that the removal also likely violated Cookโs procedural rights under the Fifth \nAmendmentโs Due Process Clause. She has also demonstrated irreparable harm from her removal. \nFinally, the public interest and the balance of the equities also favor Cook. Because the standard \nfor a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction are the same, and because the Court \nhas held an adversarial hearing on the motion and received additional briefing from the Parties, \nthe Court will construe Plaintiffโs motion for a temporary restraining order as a motion for a \npreliminary injunction, and GRANT the requested injunction.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Framework \nThe Federal Reserve System was established over a century ago by Congress in the Federal \nReserve Act. See 12 U.S.C. ยง 221 et seq. โThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-\nprivate entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the \nUnited States.โ Trump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (2025). This system involves a โcomplex \nset of relationshipsโ between the Board of Governors, the Federal Open Market Committee \n(FOMC), and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks. United States ex rel. Kraus v. Wells \nFargo & Co., 943 F.3d 588, 592 (2d Cir. 2019); see also 12 U.S.C. ยงยง 222, 225a. \n  The Board of Governors is tasked with, among other duties, โpromot[ing] effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.โ 12 U.S.C. \nยง 225a. The Board โconducts monetary policy, regulates banking institutions, and maintains the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 3 of 49\nstability of the nationโs financial system.โ Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of Fed. Rsrv. Emp. \nBenefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citing 12 U.S.C. ยง 248). Sound monetary policy \noften involves making short-term sacrifices for the long-term good of the economy. Congress \ntherefore designed the Federal Reserve and the Board of Governors to possess characteristics that \nreflect their insulation from other parts of the federal government, in particular with respect to the \nBoardโs monetary policy decisions. The Board is funded outside of the annual appropriations \nprocess, through bank assessments. 12 U.S.C. ยงยง 243, 244; see Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. \nProt. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 207 (2020). Its decisions and deliberations on monetary policy matters \nare exempt from Government Accountability Office audits and its rules regarding monetary policy \nare exempt from the Congressional Review Act. 12 U.S.C. ยง 3910(a)(3); 5 U.S.C. ยง 807.

Factual and Procedural Background  \nPresident Joseph Biden nominated Plaintiff Lisa Cook for a fourteen-year term on the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors on May 12, 2023. ECF 1 ยถ 31. At the time, Cook was already \nserving on the Board, having previously been appointed by President Biden and confirmed by the \nSenate, on May 10, 2022, to fill the remainder of an unexpired term that was scheduled to end on \nJanuary 31, 2024. Id. ยถยถ 29โ31. Cookโs nomination to the new fourteen-year term was confirmed \nby the Senate on September 6, 2023. Id. ยถ 31. Her fourteen-year term was set to expire in 2038. \nId.   \n  On August 15, 2025, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), \nWilliam Pulte, sent a referral letter to Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Department of Justice \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 5 of 49\nSpecial Attorney Edward Martin accusing Cook of committing mortgage fraud in June and July \n2021, before she was nominated and confirmed to the Board. Id. ยถ 43; ECF 1-2 at 2โ3. On August \n20, 2025, Pulte publicly released two screenshots of pages from the letter on the social media \nplatform X (formerly known as Twitter). ECF 1 ยถ 43; ECF 1-2 at 2โ3. Within thirty minutes, \nPresident Trump posted on the social media platform Truth Social that โCook must resign, \nnow!!!,โ and shared a link to a news article regarding the allegations. ECF 1 ยถ 44. \n  The letter (as excerpted in Pulteโs social media post) accused Cook of โfalsifying residence \nstatuses for an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based residence and an Atlanta, Georgia-based property in \norder to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.โ ECF 1-2 at 2. \nAccording to Pulte, on June 18, 2021, Cook had taken out a loan on a property in Michigan. Id. at \n2. The terms of the mortgage agreement stated that Cook would use the property as her โprincipal \nresidenceโ for at least one year after the date of occupancy. Id. at 2โ3. However, two weeks later, \nCook purchased a condominium in Atlanta, and in the mortgage agreement, affirmed that this \nproperty would serve as her โprimary residenceโ for a full year. Id. at 3.  \n  Two days after Director Pulte posted the referral letter, President Trump said in an \ninterview that โwhat [Cook] did was badโ and that he would โfire her if she doesnโt resign.โ ECF 1 \nยถ 45. Then, on August 25, 2025, President Trump posted screenshots of a two-page letter to his \nTruth Social account. ECF 1-3 at 2. Cook alleges that she was provided no advance notice of the \nletter before it was posted. ECF 1 ยถ 47. The letter, dated August 25 and addressed to Cook, \nprovided:  \nPursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution of the United States \nand the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, you are hereby removed from \nyour  position  on  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve,  effective \nimmediately.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 6 of 49\nThe Federal Reserve Act provides that you may be removed, at my discretion, for \ncause. See 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. I have determined that there is sufficient cause to \nremove you from your position.  \n \nECF 1-3 at 2. For support, the letter cited to Director Pulteโs August 15 criminal referral.1 Id. \nPresident Trump stated that โthere is sufficient reason to believe you may have made false \nstatements on one or more mortgage agreements.โ Id. Citing to the referral, the President said that \nCook โsigned one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be [her] primary residence \nfor the next year,โ and โ[t]wo weeks later . . . signed another document for a property in Georgia \nstating that it would be [her] primary residence for the next year.โ Id. President Trump claimed \nthat it was โinconceivable that [Cook was] not aware of [her] first commitment when making the \nsecond,โ and it was โimpossible that [she] intended to honor both.โ Id. The President then \nacknowledged the Federal Reserveโs โtremendous responsibility for setting interest rates and \nregulating reserve and member banks.โ Id. He continued:  \nThe American people must be able to have full confidence in the honesty of the \nmembers entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve. In light \nof your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot \nand I do not have such confidence in your integrity. At a minimum, the conduct at \nissue exhibits the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into \nquestion your competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.  \n \nId. The President concluded by stating that โI have determined that faithfully executing the law \nrequires your immediate removal from office.โ Id.  \n  Cook filed a six-count complaint on August 28, 2025. See ECF 1. Count One alleges that \nthe President violated the Federal Reserve Act because his justification for removing her did not \nqualify as โcauseโ under the statute. Id. ยถยถ 61โ66. Count Two alleges that under the Federal \nReserve Act, Cook was entitled to notice and a hearing before her removal. Id. ยถยถ 67โ71. Count \n \n1 The removal letterโs text states that the criminal referral was โattached to this letter,โ but the referral letter was not \nitself shared as part of President Trumpโs social media post. ECF 1-3 at 2.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 7 of 49\nThree alleges that the termination, without notice and any opportunity to be heard, violates the \nFifth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause because she has a property interest in her continued \nemployment  as  a  Governor.  Id.  ยถยถ 72โ78.  Count  Four  seeks  a  declaratory  judgment  that \nDefendants lack the authority to remove her without complying with applicable statutes and \nregulations. Id. ยถยถ 79โ81. Count Five, brought only against Chair Powell and the Board of \nGovernors, seeks a writ of mandamus commanding these Defendants not to effectuate President \nTrumpโs purported termination. Id. ยถยถ 82โ83. Count Six also seeks equitable relief against Powell \nand the Board to prevent and restrain ongoing violations of statutory and constitutional law. Id. \nยถยถ 84โ86.  \nAfter receiving Cookโs motion for a temporary restraining order, also on August 28, 2025, \nthe Court set a motion hearing for the next morning. See Notice of Hrโg (Aug. 29, 2025). Shortly \nbefore the hearing, Defendant Donald Trump filed his response to the motion. ECF 13. Defendants \nPowell and the Board of Governors filed a notice stating that they would not be offering arguments \nconcerning Cookโs motion. ECF 12. At the hearing, counsel for Cook indicated that they intended \nto file a reply before the Court ruled, which they did on September 2, 2025. ECF 17. The Court \nthen allowed counsel for President Trump to file an additional response, which they did on \nSeptember 4, 2025. ECF 23. Finally, Cook requested leave to file an additional reply, ECF 24, \nwhich the Court granted in a separate order.  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nโA temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy, one that should be granted only \nwhen the moving party, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.โ Sibley v. Obama, \n810 F. Supp. 2d 309, 310 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997)). \nThe Court considers the same factors in ruling on a motion for a temporary restraining order and \na motion for a preliminary injunction. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. FTC, 844 F. Supp. 2d 98, 101 \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 8 of 49\n(D.D.C. 2012). To prevail on either motion, the movant โmust show (1) a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were not granted, \n(3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) that the public \ninterest would be furthered by the injunction.โ Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, \n454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006). In a case like this one, where the Government is the non-\nmovant, the third and fourth factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nAt this preliminary juncture, Cook has demonstrated that each of the factors weighs in \nfavor of preliminary injunctive relief on at least some of her claims.2  \nA.  Cook Is Substantially Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nThe Court finds Cook substantially likely to succeed on at least two of her claims. First, \nthe Court finds Cook likely to succeed on her argument that President Trump violated the Federal \nReserve  Act  because  her  purported  removal  did  not  comply  with  the  statuteโs  โfor  causeโ \nrequirement. Second, the Court finds Cook likely to succeed on her claim that the purported \nremoval deprived her of procedural rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.3  \n1.  President Trumpโs Stated Cause for Firing Cook Likely Does Not Satisfy the โFor \nCauseโ Requirement in the Federal Reserve Act. \n \nThe key question in this dispute is the meaning of the term โfor causeโ in the Federal \nReserve Act. 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. The history of the repeated litigation over the constitutional validity \nof similar removal restrictions is too extensive to recount here. See, e.g., Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n \n2 As discussed below, the Court construes Cookโs motion for a temporary restraining order as a motion for a \npreliminary injunction. See infra section III.D. Again, the legal standard is the same. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., \n844 F. Supp. 2d at 101.  \n \n3 Cook also argues that her purported removal violated procedural protections that she was entitled to as a statutory \nmatter under the Federal Reserve Act. ECF 2-1 at 21; ECF 17 at 20โ22. Because the Court finds Cook likely to succeed \non the merits of her other claims, and that those claims support injunctive relief, it declines to reach Cookโs statutory \nprocess arguments now.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 9 of 49\n220, 250 (2021); Seila L. LLC, 591 U.S. at 197. But in this case, the Government does not contest \nthe constitutionality of the โfor causeโ removal restriction for Board Governors. Instead, it argues \nthat President Trump provided a legal cause under the Federal Reserve Act to remove Cook, and \nthat his decision to do so is not subject to judicial review. ECF 13 at 2. The Court disagrees on \nboth points. Cook has shown that President Trumpโs allegations likely do not qualify as cause \njustifying her removal under the Federal Reserve Act and that the Court can resolve the Partiesโ \ndispute about the interpretation of this statute.  \na.  The Meaning of โFor Causeโ in the Federal Reserve Act  \n \nThe Federal Reserve Act does not define the term โfor cause.โ Generally, when a statutory \nterm is undefined, courts look first to what โthat termโs โordinary, contemporary, common \nmeaningโ was when Congress enactedโ the statute. Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, \n588 U.S. 427, 434 (2019) (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)). Additionally, \nโthe words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall \nstatutory scheme.โ Jazz Pharms., Inc. v. Kennedy, 141 F.4th 254, 261 (D.C. Cir. 2025) (citing Util. \nAir Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 320 (2014)). โStatutory history is an important part of this \ncontext.โ Id. Applying these tools, the Court concludes that the permissible grounds for โfor causeโ \nremoval in the Federal Reserve Act are limited to grounds concerning an officialโs behavior in \noffice and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing statutory duties. The โfor \ncauseโ standard thus does not contemplate removing an individual purely for conduct that occurred \nbefore they assumed the position.  \ni.  Statutory Text and Contemporary Definitions \nThe Government first urges the Court to look to dictionary definitions of the word โcauseโ \nat the time the Federal Reserve Act was first passed in 1913. It claims that โcauseโ was understood \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 10 of 49\nto simply mean a โmotive or reason,โ or โground of action,โ see ECF 13 at 11โ12 (citing Whartonโs \nLaw-Lexicon 150 (11th ed. 1911) and Blackโs Law Dictionary 178 (2d ed. 1910)), and as a result, \nโcauseโ โcover[s] any articulable justification that the President deems sufficient to warrant \nremoval,โ with the exception that, cause cannot extend to โmere policy disagreement,โ id. Cook \nargues that โfor causeโ is a legal term of art and its meaning is not resolved simply by looking to \ndictionary definitions. ECF 17 at 14.  \nWhen identifying the common meaning of the text when Congress enacted the removal \nprovision, the Court looks to the definition as understood in 1935, rather than 1913. The โfor \ncauseโ removal provision of the Federal Reserve Act was first enacted in 1913. See Pub. L. No. \n63-43, 38 Stat. 251, 260 (1913). The โfor causeโ requirement appears, however, to have been \nremoved in the 1933 Banking Act, which amended 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 to provide merely that โeach \nappointive member shall hold office for a term of twelve years from the expiration of the term of \nhis predecessor.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 (1933 supp.); Pub. L. No. 73-66, ยง 6, 48 Stat. 162, 166โ67 \n(1933). The present โfor causeโ provision was then returned to the statute following the passage \nof the 1935 Banking Act, which reorganized the leadership structure of the Federal Reserve. Pub. \nL. No. 74-305, ยง 203, 49 Stat. 684, 704โ05 (1935); see also Gary Richardson & David W. Wilcox, \nHow Congress Designed the Federal Reserve to be Independent of Presidential Control, 39 J. of \nEcon. Perspectives 221, 229 (2025).  \nAt the time of the 1935 amendment, it is true that legal dictionaries defined the word \nโcauseโ as the โorigin or foundation of a thing,โ or a โground of action,โ consistent with the \nGovernmentโs definition. Blackโs Law Dictionary 292 (3d ed. 1933). But they also support the \nnotion  that  โfor  causeโ  was  itself  a  separate  term  that  carried  meaning  independent  of  its \ncomponent parts. The 1933 edition of Blackโs Law Dictionary contains a separate entry for โfor \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 11 of 49\ncauseโ: โWith reference to the power of removal from office, this term means some cause other \nthan the will or pleasure of the removing authority, that is, some cause relating to the conduct, \nability, fitness, or competence of the officer.โ Id. at 796 (emphasis added).  \nPerhaps recognizing that โfor causeโ has to mean more than just any stated reason, at the \nhearing on this motion, counsel for the Government suggested a new definition of โfor causeโ as \nany reason the President can think of so long as that reason (1) is something other than mere policy \ndisagreement, (2) bears on the individualโs ability or fitness to do the job, and (3) was not known \nat the time of the officialโs confirmation. Hrโg Tr. at 66:13โ16 (Aug. 29, 2025). That position is in \nobvious tension with the Governmentโs preferred dictionary-definition approach to โcauseโ in its \ninitial briefing, and the Governmentโs supplemental briefing does not resolve the discrepancy. See \nECF 13 at 9; ECF 23. Thus, even the Government admits that the definition of โfor causeโ in this \ncontext cannot extend to any articulable reason the President deems to warrant removal and must \nhave some limitations. More than dictionary definitions are required to resolve this dispute.  \nii.  Legislative Context \nThe Presidentโs ability to remove a member of the Board of Governors must also be \nunderstood within the โoverall statutory schemeโ governing the Federal Reserve, see West Virginia \nv. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022), which contemplates a degree of insulation from presidential \npressure, particularly with respect to its monetary policymaking decisions. As the Supreme Court \nhas observed when distinguishing the Federal Reserve from other agencies, the Federal Reserve is \na โuniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the \nFirst and Second Banks of the United States,โ Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415, one for which Congress \nhas provided significant independence and insulation. See Richardson & Wilcox at 223โ30 \n(reviewing the legislative history of the Banking Act of 1935 and concluding that the bill reflected \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 12 of 49\nan intent that โmonetary policy was independent of the presidentโ); Banking Act of 1935: Hearings \non S.1715 and H.R. 7617 Before the S. Comm. On Banking & Currency (โSenate Banking Act \nHearingsโ), 74th Cong. 408 (1935). The Federal Reserveโs structure, and in particular, the for \ncause protection, reflects Congressโs decision that โa degree of independence was needed to \nโincrease the ability of the banking system to promote stability.โโ PHH Corp. v. Consumer Fin. \nProt. Bureau, 881 F.3d 75, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 74-742, at 1 (1935)), \nabrogated on other grounds by Seila L. LLC, 591 U.S. 197. โBy insulating the Board from \npresidential control and political pressures, Congress sought to ensure that the Federal Reserve \nwould โreflect, not the opinion of a majority of special interests, but rather the well considered \njudgment of a body that takes into consideration all phases of national economic life.โโ Id. (quoting \nH.R. Rep. No. 74-742, at 6). \nThe historical context in which Congress enacted the Banking Act of 1935 demonstrates \nan awareness of the importance of such protections. The Banking Act of 1935 was passed shortly \nfollowing the Supreme Courtโs decision in Humphreyโs Executor v. United States. Humphreyโs \nExecutor established that a โfor causeโ protection for members of the Federal Trade Commission \n(FTC), limiting removal to โinefficiency, neglect of duty, and malfeasance in office,โ did not \nviolate the Constitution. 295 U.S. 602, 629 (1935). The Court in Humphreyโs Executor noted that \nthe Presidentโs power to remove was a โcoercive influence,โ which naturally โthreatens the \nindependence of a commission.โ Id. at 630. Even the Government agrees on this point, when it \nconcedes that a โpolicy disagreementโ with a Federal Reserve Governor cannot qualify as a โfor \ncauseโ removal ground. ECF 13 at 18 (citing Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958)); \nsee also Hrโg Tr. at 55:24โ56:2.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 13 of 49\nAt the hearings on the Banking Act, members of Congress and the witnesses took note of \nthe Humphreyโs Executor case and its implications for the Federal Reserveโs independence. Senate \nBanking Act Hearings at 396โ97 (witness arguing that the Federal Reserveโs โindependence from \npolitical control must be assured,โ and that passage of the bill should be postponed until the \nHumphreyโs Executor decision clarified the issue of removal protections); id. 754โ56 (witness \nnoting the pendency of Humphreyโs Executor and arguing that โno member of the Board shall be \nremovable from office during the term for which he was appointedโ). And the final bill reflects \nthat what was true for the FTC in Humphreyโs Executor is true for the Federal Reserve: โ[T]he \nlanguage of the act, the legislative reports, and the general purposes of the legislation as reflected \nby the debates,โ all demonstrate โthe congressional intent to create a body of experts who shall \ngain experience by length of service; a body which shall be independent of executive authority, \nexcept in its selection, and free to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other \nofficial or any department of the government.โ Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 625โ26. The Federal \nReserve Actโs โfor causeโ restriction on the removal of Board Governors is a key part of the \nstatutory scheme protecting the Board of Governors from the naturally โcoercive influenceโ of the \npower of presidential removal which โthreatens [its] independence.โ Id. at 630. This statutory \nscheme points in favor of a narrower, rather than broader, understanding of โfor cause.โ  \niii.  Relationship to Prior Removal Statutes \nโIt is a commonplace of statutory interpretation that โCongress legislates against the \nbackdrop of existing law.โโ Parker Drilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 611 \n(2019) (quoting McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 398 n.3 (2013)). Accordingly, the Court \nfinds highly persuasive Cookโs argument that the Federal Reserve Actโs use of โfor causeโ should \nalso be read in light of prior statutory removal provisions for Presidentially appointed, Senate-\n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 14 of 49\nconfirmed roles. Those provisions consistently limited the grounds for presidential removal of \nagency heads or members to some combination of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \n(referred to in shorthand as INM), which meant โcases where officials act wrongfully in officeโ \n(malfeasance), โfail to perform their statutory dutiesโ (neglect of duty), โor perform them in such \nan inexpert or wasteful manner that they impair the public welfareโ (inefficiency). Jane Manners \n& Lev Menand, The Three Permissions: Presidential Removal and the Statutory Limits of Agency \nIndependence, 121 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 8 (2021). \nIn 1935, federal statutes imposing restrictions on the Presidentโs ability to remove board \nand agency members had two essential flavors: They either provided that the official could be \nremoved โfor cause,โ with no further elaboration as to the meaning of that term, or they provided \nthat the official could be removed for some combination of INM, with that formula first being used \nfor the removal protections for the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. See Manners & \nMenand app. b. at 74โ75 (identifying three federal officer removal statutes before August 1935 \nthat used โfor cause,โ and eleven that used some combination of INM); ch. 104, ยง 11, 24 Stat. 383 \n(1887). With minor exceptions, the only enumerated removal bases appear to be the INM bases.4 \nStatutes did not use โfor causeโ and INM in the same removal provision. See Manners & Menand \napp. b. at 74โ75. As for the statutes that enumerated either inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance in \noffice as a basis for removal, not all used all three grounds. See id.; see, e.g., Pub. L. No. 67-347, \n \n4 There appear to be two minor exceptions. A statute creating a โBoard of Mediationโ for disputes between employers \nand employees of common carriers provided that the Commissioner could be removed for โmisconduct in office.โ See \nPub. L. No. 63-6, ยง 11, 38 Stat. 103, 108 (1913). The Board of Mediation was later replaced by the National Mediation \nBoard, whose members could only be removed for โinefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or \nineligibility.โ Pub. L. No. 73-442, ยง 4, 48 Stat. 1193, 1193โ94 (1934) (emphasis added). While the Court cannot be \npositive at this preliminary stage that it has reviewed every relevant removal provision in the U.S. Code, a review of \nthe statutes cited in Manners and Menandโs article supports Cookโs claim that โby 1935, the only statutorily \nenumerated grounds for presidential removal of executive officers were INM.โ ECF 17 at 12 (emphasis in original). \nMoreover, the Government has not disputed this characterization of the U.S. Code at the time.  \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 15 of 49\nยง 1, 42 Stat. 1023 (1922) (providing that members of the United States Coal Commission were to \nbe appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and could โbe removed \nby the President for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but for no other causeโ).  \nSo,  the  overwhelming  backdrop  of  enumerated  federal  removal  restrictions  for \nPresidentially appointed, tenure-protected roles at either the time of the 1913 Federal Reserve Act \nor the 1935 Banking Act was composed of the INM grounds. Neither the Supreme Court nor lower \ncourts have provided a definitive interpretation of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \noffice, either jointly or separately, in the context of federal removal protections for independent \nagency members. See Manners & Menand at 4. But recent scholarship shows that before entering \nthe federal lexicon, these terms carried with them historical meanings particular to the context of \npublic administration and officer removal. See id. at 6 (โWhen Congress first used the now-\ntalismanic INM phrase in 1887, it defined these circumstances using terms that were already well-\nknown.โ). As is relevant here, each of the INM grounds referred to the officerโs performance of \ntheir statutory duties or their conduct in office. The ground of inefficiency, a term first used \nextensively in state civil service reform bills in the late nineteenth century, was โassociated not \nonly  with  incompetence  but  with  the  wasteful  expenditure  of  government  resources,โ  and \ninefficient officers โlacked the skills to perform their duties, rendering them incapable of doing \ntheir jobs.โ Id. at 6, 45; see also id. at 45โ52.5 Neglect of duty has a multi-century history as a term \nmeaning the failure โto perform oneโs duties in a way that caused specific harm toโ the entity to \n \n5 Inefficiency was โadded to the removal lexicon only in the middle of the nineteenth century, when legislators used \nthe term to describe wasteful government administration caused by inept officers.โ Manners & Menand at 28. Manners \nand Menand identify inefficiency first being used as a removal ground for tenure-protected officers in Indiana state \ncode provisions from 1843. Id. at 47 n.269, 48 n.277 (citing 1843 Ind. Rev. Stat., ch. 4, ยงยง 37, 47). The term was \nsubsequently used in state law and in a โseries of civil service reform bills,โ before it was included as a removal ground \nin the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887. Id. at 52.  \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 16 of 49\nwhich the officer owed the duties. Id. at 29.6 โMalfeasance in officeโ also had an extensive history \nin the common law, colonial practice, and American state law, and referred to a โwrongful act \ncommitted in the execution of oneโs duties that caused injuries to others.โ7 Id. at 6 (emphasis \nadded). While each of these terms addresses different conduct, what ties them together is a concern \nwith an officialโs in-office conduct or performance: they all relate to whether an official is faithfully \nand effectively executing their statutory duties. \niv.  โFor Causeโ in the Federal Reserve Act Refers to In-Office Conduct \nthat Demonstrates Ineffective or Unfaithful Execution of Statutory \nDuties. \n \nBased on the statutory context above, the Court finds that the โfor causeโ provision in the \nFederal Reserve Act extends only to concerns about the Board memberโs ability to effectively and \nfaithfully execute their statutory duties, in light of circumstances that have occurred while they are \nin office. The historical background shows that when creating various agencies, departments, and \nboards during the period leading up to the passage of the Banking Act of 1935 and enumerating \nthe grounds for removal from those bodies, Congress was narrowly focused on the INM grounds. \nUnder the doctrine of in pari materia, statutes โrelate[d] to the same subject or objectโ are \nโconstrued together.โ Common Cause v. Fed. Election Commโn, 842 F.2d 436, 441โ42 (D.C. Cir. \n1988); Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 244 (1972) (โ[The rule] necessarily assumes \n \n6 โNeglectโ had been a ground for removing the โofficers of English towns and boroughs for hundreds of years,โ and \nconstituted a type of โmisdemeanor,โ or โbad behavior,โ that could trigger the removal of life-tenured officers. Id. at \n6. โNeglect of dutyโ was also a historical common-law basis for the removal of โgood behaviorโ roles like judges and \nclerks. Id. at 28โ29. Manners and Menand also identify state statutes beginning in the early 1800s that either penalize \nofficials for neglect of duty or make them removable on that ground. Id. at 43โ44.  \n \n7 Malfeasance was featured in the context of common-law municipal officer and public official removal, both in \nEngland and the United States. Id. at 28โ29. Like โneglect of duty,โ it was considered a misdemeanor that could trigger \nan officerโs removal. Id. at 6. Under American state law in the 1800s, it was a ground to find that an officer had failed \nto engage in the โfaithful performanceโ of the duties of his office. See id. at 41 n.224 (citing Harris v. Hanson, 11 Me. \n241, 245 (1834)).  \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 17 of 49\nthat whenever Congress passes a new statute, it acts aware of all previous statutes on the same \nsubject.โ). That rule is instructive here. The fact that Congress was narrowly focused on the \nofficerโs on-the-job performance in contemporary officer removal statutes supports the conclusion \nthat Congress did not mean โfor causeโ removal to extend to conduct of a significantly different \nkind.  \nCook argues that this Court should find that โfor causeโ in the Federal Reserve Act is \nsynonymous with and limited to the prevailing INM standard. ECF 17 at 10. Contemporary usage \nat the time of the passage of the Banking Act of 1935 indicates that the three terms were indeed \noften treated synonymously with โfor cause.โ See Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 171โ72 \n(1926) (describing a statute that provided for โremoval for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office,โ as one containing provisions for โremoval for causeโ (emphasis added)). \nThis might explain why โfor causeโ and INM were not used in the same statute. If โfor causeโ was \na synonym for INM, using the terms together would have been superfluous. \nA traditional presumption of statutory interpretation, however, is that when Congress \nโemploys different words, it usually means different things.โ Ortiz v. Secโy of Def., 41 F.3d 738, \n740 (D.C. Cir. 1994). So Cook is likely not correct that โfor causeโ and the INM standard are \nperfectly synonymous. But that statutory interpretation principle also dooms the Governmentโs \ninitial argument that โfor causeโ means โany articulable justification that the President deems \nsufficient to warrant removal.โ ECF 13 at 12. Congress knew how to state a lesser requirement, \nand did so in a different section of the Banking Act of 1935, which provided that the Comptroller \nof the Currency, a Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed official, would hold office for \nโfive years unless sooner removed by the President, upon reasons to be communicated by him to \nthe Senate.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 2 (emphasis added); Pub. L. No. 74-305, ยง 209, 49 Stat. 703, 707 (1935). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 18 of 49\nThus, as the Government has already conceded, โfor causeโ must mean something more than any \nโreason[]โ the President could communicate. 12 U.S.C. ยง 2. \nThat โfor causeโ means something broader than INM finds some support in the Supreme \nCourtโs analysis in Collins v. Yellen, which reviewed the constitutionality of the removal protection \nfor the Director of the FHFA, which, as here, provided for removal โfor cause.โ 594 U.S. at 255. \nThere, the Court did not purport to definitively interpret the meaning of โfor cause,โ although it \nnoted that the language โappear[ed] to give the President more removal authority than other \nremoval provisions,โ such as one for โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.โ Id. \nFurther, the Court was interpreting a โfor causeโ removal provision passed in 2008, not one passed \nin 1935. See 12 U.S.C. ยง 4512. Since 1935, the enumerated justifications for independent agency \nand board member removal have expanded beyond simply INM to consist of grounds such as \nโimmorality, ineligibility, offenses involving moral turpitude, and conviction of a crime.โ See \nManners & Menand at 63 n.363; see, e.g., Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., \n561 U.S. 477 app. A at 549โ56 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (cataloging removal grounds); Monsalvo \nVelazquez v. Bondi, 145 S. Ct. 1232, 1245 n.5 (2025) (โ[D]ifferent statutes passed at different \ntimes against different regulatory backdrops may bear different meanings.โ). And the logic in \nCollins demonstrates why โfor causeโ in one statutory context may not be the same in another. In \nrelying on cases involving the employer-employee relationship, Collins observed that โdisobeying \nan order is generally regarded as โcauseโ for removal.โ 594 U.S. at 256 (citing NLRB v. Loc. Union \nNo. 1229, Intโl Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 346 U.S. 464, 475 (1953)). But here, the President is not \nempowered to direct the Board of Governors in the same manner, or to remove a Governor for \nfailing to follow his directions. The ability to do so would be tantamount to being able to fire for \npolicy disagreement, which the Government has admitted the President cannot do.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 19 of 49\nAnd again, even if โfor causeโ means something more than the traditional INM grounds, \nthe Court is not convinced that it encompasses reasons of a different kind altogether than those \ngrounds. The fact remains that INM grounds were the key causes recognized in similar federal \nstatutes at the time. Defining โfor causeโ in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 as extending to in-office conduct that \nis closely related to the INM grounds would still provide โfor causeโ with some independent \nmeaning separate from INM. The existing landscape of removal statutes indicates that Congress \nwanted officials to be judged on their performance and conduct while holding the role. Insofar as \nthere were any other recognized grounds for removal at the time, those also involved in-office \nconduct. For example, the Commissioner of Mediation and Conciliation could only be removed \nby the President for โmisconduct in office.โ Pub. L. No. 63-6, ยง 11, 38 Stat. 103, 108 (1913) \n(emphasis added); see also Pub. L. No. 73-442, ยง 4, 48 Stat. 1193, 1193โ94 (1934) (providing for \nremoval from the National Mediation Board for either โinefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance \nin office, or ineligibilityโ (emphasis added)). State statutes also contemplated that โmisfeasanceโ \ncould be grounds for punishment or removal from office. Whereas malfeasance is the โdoing [of] \nan act wholly wrongful,โ misfeasance is โ[t]he improper performance of some act which a man \nmay lawfully do.โ See, e.g., Blackโs Law Dictionary 1193 (3d ed. 1933) (distinguishing the two \nterms). While both related to performance in office, they are separate concepts and were treated \nseparately in state removal law. See Manners & Menand at 41 n.226, 43.  \nThe Governmentโs alternative reading that โfor causeโ means โa reason thatโ is (1) โmore \nthan mere policy disagreement,โ (2) โbears on the individualโs ability or fitness to do the job,โ and \n(3) โwas not known at the time of the officialโs confirmation,โ is too broad. Hrโg Tr. at 66:14โ16. \nFirst, the Governmentโs proposed โability or fitnessโ testโparticularly when combined with the \nGovernmentโs  claim  that  the  Presidentโs  decision  is  completely  unreviewableโputs  little \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 20 of 49\nfunctional limitation on the Presidentโs ability to remove a Board Governor. The Governmentโs \nalternative position, one for which it has provided little textual or historical basis, would allow the \nPresident to remove individuals even for arbitrary reasons provided that the President viewed the \nreasons as relevant to the individualโs ability or fitness to do the job. Moreover, it would incentivize \nthe President and subordinates to dig up prior conduct, however insubstantial, to justify removal \nfrom the Board, even where the Board member has been up to that point performing their statutory \nduties impeccably. Second, the Governmentโs concession that conduct that was known to the \nappointing authorities (the President and Senate) at the time of a Board memberโs appointment \ncould not be the basis for a later โfor causeโ firing is at odds with the Governmentโs theory that \nthe conduct that a President may take into account when making a โfor causeโ determination lacks \nany temporal limitation.  \nA little more about that point. In its opening brief, the Government observes that Cookโs \nreading of the statute as providing for potential removal based only upon a Governorโs conduct in \noffice  โwould  insulate  all  manner  of  gross  wrongdoingโ  and  preclude  the  President  from \nโremov[ing] a Governor who was revealed to have committed massive financial fraudโso long \nas it happened before confirmation.โ ECF 13 at 17. But, as the Court has already mentioned, the \nGovernment has since recognized a likely exception for conductโeven that amounting to โgross \nwrongdoingโโif it was known at the time of confirmation. Hrโg Tr. at 66:13โ16. Why should the \nquestion of whether conduct satisfies the statuteโs โfor causeโ requirement turn on whether the \nconduct  was  known  prior  to  confirmation?  If  past  fraud  provides  a  sufficient  (and  in  the \nGovernmentโs view, obvious) justification for removal under this statute, it is not clear why the \nfact that a prior administration was aware of the conduct would sufficiently address a later \nPresidentโs  concerns  about  a  Governorโs  continued  service,  or  cabin  what  the  Government \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 21 of 49\notherwise suggests is the Presidentโs unfettered discretion to remove officers for almost any \nreason. The Court suspects that the Government acknowledged this limitation because a reading \nof โfor causeโ that would permit the President to second-guess the judgment of his predecessor \nand Congress by removing duly confirmed Governors and replacing them with his own nominees \nwould offend the statutory scheme. Removing Governors from office based on conduct that was \nalready known and ratified through the confirmation process would allow for just that.8  \nThe Governmentโs argument that a rule that does not take into account pre-confirmation \nconduct will lead to a parade of horribles also ignores that this is precisely the line that Congress \nhas drawn in dozens of statutes over the past century. See Manners & Menand app. b. at 74โ75. \nFor the officers that Congress insulated with INM protections, pre-confirmation conduct has never \nbeen a basis for removal. The Court is not breaking new ground in interpreting the Federal Reserve \nActโs โfor causeโ provision consistent with this historical landscape.  \nA conclusion that Congress was not particularly concerned with addressing conduct that \noccurred before the officeholder assumed the position is similarly consistent with the Board of \nGovernorsโ appointment scheme. That scheme involves extensive opportunities for investigation \nand rigorous vetting by both the President who appoints the nominee and the Senate who confirms \nthem. Further, the Courtโs reading of the statute does not mean that a Governorโs prior conduct \ncould never relate to in-office conduct to justify removal. For example, an approach that focuses \non the individualโs in-office conduct and performance would certainly permit โfor causeโ removal \nwhere an officer is convicted of a serious crime and incarcerated while in office, even if that \n \n8 Here the Parties seem to dispute whether information about Cookโs property ownership and mortgage financing were \nโknownโ at the time she was confirmed. See ECF 17 at 17 n.6; ECF 23 at 9. The Court does not have sufficient \ninformation to resolve that dispute. Nor does it quite understand how it would go about determining what may have \nbeen known at the time of Cookโs confirmation, which is another issue with the line the Government has drawn. In \nany event, it is not necessary for the Court to find this fact at this stage. The Court rules solely on the legal questions \nraised in resolving this motion, not questions that potentially involve factual disputes.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 22 of 49\nconviction was the result of earlier conduct. Such a conviction would obviously interfere with the \nability of an officer to effectively and faithfully carry out their in-office duties. Indeed, standing \nalone, a Governorโs subsequent conviction would be a significant event occurring in office, \nregardless of when the conduct giving rise to that conviction occurred.  \nFinally, the Court is satisfied that this understanding of the โfor causeโ protection in \n12 U.S.C. ยง 242 does not unduly infringe on the Presidentโs Article II powers. The Courtโs reading \nof โfor causeโ provides broader grounds for removal than the removal protection blessed by the \nSupreme Court in Humphreyโs Executor, which permitted removal only for the classic INM \nstandard. Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 620. And in Trump v. Wilcox, which raised concerns about \nthe constitutionality of removal provisions narrower than the one in question here, the Supreme \nCourt made clear that its analysis did not extend to the Federal Reserve Boardโs โfor causeโ \nprotection. 145 S. Ct. at 1415; 29 U.S.C. ยง 153(a) (providing that members of the National Labor \nRelations Board may only be removed โfor neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no \nother causeโ); 5 U.S.C. ยง 1202(d) (providing that members of the Merit Systems Protection Board \nmay be removed โonly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in officeโ). Accordingly, \nthe Court finds that permissible cause for removal of a Federal Reserve Governor extends only to \nconcerns about the Board memberโs ability to effectively and faithfully execute their statutory \nduties, in light of events that have occurred while they are in office. \nb.  The Presidentโs Decision is Reviewable to Determine if He Has Stated a \nLegally Permissible Cause.  \n \nThe Government argues that whatever the definition of โfor causeโ in the Federal Reserve \nAct, this Court lacks the ability to review the Presidentโs decision. ECF 13 at 7โ9. According to \nthe Government, the determination of cause is committed to the Presidentโs discretion by statute, \nleaving no role for this Court.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 23 of 49\nThe Court disagrees. It is true that when a statute โentrusts a discrete specific decision to \nthe President and contains no limitations on the Presidentโs exercise of that authority, judicial \nreview of an abuse of discretion claim is not available.โ Mountain States Legal Found. v. Bush, \n306 F.3d 1132, 1136 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, \n1331 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). But โwhere the authorizing statute . . . places discernible limits on the \nPresidentโs discretion,โ review is available, given that the โresponsibility of determining the limits \nof statutory grants of authority . . . is a judicial function entrusted to the courts.โ Id. (quoting Reich, \n74 F.3d at 1327).  \nThe Government acknowledges that there are contexts under which Cookโs challenge \nwould be reviewable. At oral argument, the Government conceded that Cookโs case would be \nreviewable had President Trump provided Cook with no cause whatsoever. Hrโg Tr. 58:13โ16. In \nsuch a case, President Trump, required to remove Cook โfor cause,โ would have clearly exceeded \nhis statutory authority in failing to do so. In the Governmentโs view, however, because the statute \ndoes not clearly define โfor cause,โ the President โnecessarily must make a discretionary judgment \nin exercising th[e] [removal] power,โ and the โsufficiency and adequacy of th[e] reasonโ given is \nnot reviewable. ECF 13 at 11. The Court finds that this is doubly incorrect in the context of this \ncase. First, the Governmentโs argument fails because, as discussed above, the term โfor causeโ as \nused in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242, has definable limits, which include that a member of the Board of \nGovernors may only be removed for in-office conduct demonstrating that they are not effectively \nand faithfully carrying out their statutory duties. Thus, when confronted with a justification offered \nby the President that clearly does not fall within the Presidentโs statutory authority, this Court has \nthe responsibility to review. It is no different than if the President had attempted to fire Cook \nwithout cause or for a reason the Government acknowledges sits outside of the statute. See \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 24 of 49\nMountain States Legal Found., 306 F.3d at 1136. Even when a statute โdelegates discretionary \nauthorityโ to an actor, the โrole of the reviewing court . . . is, as always, to independently interpret \nthe statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits.โ Loper Bright \nEnters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 (2024); Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) \n(โIt is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law isโ). \nSecond, the Government confuses review for the sufficiency and adequacy of a permissible cause \n(such as the strength of evidence showing that an officer has engaged in misconduct while in \noffice), with whether the President has even provided a legally permissible cause in the first place, \nwhich is clearly reviewable.  \nIn  arguing  otherwise,  the  Government  primarily  relies  on  Reagan  v.  United  States, \n182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901), a case brought by a commissioner of the U.S. Court for the Indian \nterritory challenging his removal. In Reagan, the statute provided that the commissioners were to \nโhold office under their existing appointments, subject to removal by the judge of the district where \nsaid commissioners reside, for causes prescribed by law.โ Id. at 424. The commissionersโ terms \nwere not fixed by statute. Id. The Court found that despite the appointment statuteโs reference to \nโcauses prescribed by law,โ no causes for removal had ever been โaffirmatively specified by \nCongress.โ Id. at 425. As a result, the Court stated that โremoval for cause, when causes are not \ndefined nor removal for cause provided for, is a matter of discretion, and not reviewable.โ Id.  \nReagan does not control this case. First, it is unlikely that Reaganโs analysis even applies \nto a Federal Board Governor. Reagan identified term-of-years protection and โcauses of removalโ \nprovisions as two separate types of limitations on the ability of the โappointing power . . . [to] \nremove at pleasure or for such cause as it deemed sufficient.โ Id. at 425. Either, the Court noted, \nwere sufficient to trigger a procedural requirement that the removed officer receive a notice and \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 25 of 49\nhearing before removal. See id. (noting โthe rule . . . that where causes of removal are specified by \nConstitution or statute, as also where the term of office is for a fixed period, notice and hearing \nare essentialโ (emphasis added)). But because the commissioner in Reagan did not โhold their \noffice[] for life or by any fixed tenure,โ they therefore โf[ell] within the settled rule that the power \nof removal is incident to the power of appointment.โ Id. at 424. Here, Cookโs position is for a set \nterm of years and thus not covered by the holding in Reagan. Second, even if Reaganโs analysis \napplied to an officer with a term-of-years protection, the statute in Reagan is substantially different \nfrom the โfor causeโ statute here. The statute in Reagan provided that the President could fire โfor \ncauses prescribed by law,โ but Congress had not prescribed any specific causes, permissible or \nimpermissible. Id. at 425. Here, the Court has determined that โfor causeโ is a circumscribed \ncategory, the bounds of which are judicially policeable. \nSimilarly, the Court does not find that the Supreme Court of the District of Columbiaโs \nopinion in United States ex rel. Garland v. Oliver governs the analysis. There, a statute allowed \nthe President to remove justices of the peace for the District of Columbia โfor cause.โ 6 Mackey \n47, 56 (Sup. Ct. D.C. 1887). While the Court at one point suggested that โwe suppose it would not \nbe, that . . . this court can review [the Presidentโs] action for the purpose of determining the \nsufficiency of the causes which induce him to remove an officer,โ this statement was clearly dicta. \nId. The Court itself acknowledged that the proposition โ[was] not argued,โ in the case, which was \nnot about the sufficiency of the cause but whether the President had the power to remove the officer \nin the first place. Id. at 48, 56. And again, the decision that would have been unreviewable in \nGarland was the โsufficiencyโ of the causes. Here, Cook presents an argument that the cause \npresented was statutorily off-limits.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 26 of 49\nFinally, taken to its logical conclusion, the Governmentโs argument leads to an absurd \nresult: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the \nGovernment claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would \nnevertheless be unreviewable. Hrโg Tr. at 58:17โ59:4. This cannot be the case. Such a rule would \nprovide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the \nPresident could, in practice, โremove a member . . . merely because he wanted his own appointees \non theโ Board of Governors. Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356. Here, there is a disagreement between the \nParties about the interpretation of a federal statute. The Court is exercising its appropriate role in \nresolving this dispute.   \nc.  The Presidentโs Allegations Fail to State a Qualifying Cause Under the \nStatute. \n \nHaving determined that the โfor causeโ protection in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 restricts presidential \nremoval of members of the Board of Governors to situations where the record of the Governorโs \nin-office behavior demonstrates they cannot effectively and faithfully carry out their statutory \nduties, the answer is clear: President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cookโs \nremoval.  \nPresident Trumpโs stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cookโs conduct before \nshe began serving on the Federal Reserve Board.9 As discussed above, such allegations are not a \nlegally permissible cause. The Presidentโs equivocal claim that Cook โmay have made false \nstatements on one or more mortgage agreements,โ ECF 1-3 at 2 (emphasis added), refers only to \nconduct that may have occurred before she was confirmed to her position. It does not address her \nin-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cookโs performance or personal \n \n9 Although the Court decides this issue on the ground that President Trumpโs stated cause falls outside the causes \npermissible under the statute and is not inquiring into the sufficiency of the evidence presented by President Trump, \nthe Court notes that the allegations are ones to which Cook strenuously objects. See ECF 17 at 15.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 27 of 49\nconduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties. \nWhile President Trump states in his letter that he believes that the conduct was โ[a]t a minimumโ \ngrossly negligent and โcalls into question [Cook]โs competence and trustworthiness as a financial \nregulator,โ his letter does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a \nmember of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role. \nId.  \nAgain, this outcome aligns with the understanding of โfor cause,โ in light of its legal \nmeaning at the time when the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 and restructured in 1935. The \nlesson to be drawn from the then-existing history of removal protections is that an independent \nagency official was meant to be judged by their actual performance in their office. Removal was \nnot meant to be based on the Presidentโs assumptions about the officialโs future performance as \nextrapolated from unproven conduct dating from before they assumed the office. To do otherwise \nwould open up the officer and agency to the dangers of โcontrol or coercive influence, direct or \nindirect,โ  that  would  undermine  the  independent  and  expert  judgment  of  the  officer.  See \nHumphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 629.  \nOn this record, Cook has shown that she is likely to prevail on her claim that her removal \nwas not โfor cause,โ and therefore violated the Federal Reserve Act.10    \n2.  Cook is Likely to Prevail on the Merits of Her Constitutional Due Process Claim.  \n \nCook argues that her purported removal violated procedural rights guaranteed to her by the \nFifth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause, which required that Cook receive notice and be provided \n \n10 For the purposes of this motion, the Court bases its holding on the conclusion that President Trump has stated a \nlegally impermissible reason for firing Cook and does not also need to reach Cookโs argument that the Presidentโs \ndecision failed to show โcauseโ under the Federal Reserve Act because the asserted basis for cause was โpretextual.โ \nSee ECF 1 ยถ 60.  \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 28 of 49\nan opportunity to be heard before any โfor causeโ removal occurred. The record currently before \nthe Court demonstrates that Cook did not receive such notice and hearing, and thus has shown a \nprocedural violation.  \na.  Cookโs Constitutional Due Process Rights Were Likely Violated. \nCook argues that she has a constitutionally protected property right in her continued \nposition as a member of the Board of Governors, and as a result was entitled to notice and a hearing \nbefore her termination. ECF 2-1 at 19โ20. The Government contests that Cook has a property \ninterest in her position, and even assuming that she does, argues that Cook received all the process \ndue to her under the Fifth Amendment. ECF 13 at 19โ22. \nThe Fifth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause guarantees that no person shall be โdeprived \nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ U.S. Const. amend. V. In determining \nwhether an individualโs procedural due process rights have been violated, the Court conducts a \ntwo-step inquiry. The Court โfirst determine[s] whether she was deprived of a protected interest,โ \nand if so, โthen determine[s] whether she received the process she was due.โ Esparraguera v. \nDepโt of the Army, 101 F.4th 28, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (citing UDC Chairs Chapter, Am. Assโn of \nUniv. Professors v. Bd. of Trs. of UDC, 56 F.3d 1469, 1471 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  \ni.  Cook Has a Property Interest in Her Fixed-Term, For Cause Protected \nPosition. \n \nโProperty  interests  are  not  created  by  the  Constitution.โ  Cleveland  Bd.  of  Educ.  v. \nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985). โ[T]hey are created and their dimensions are defined by \nexisting rules or understandings that stem from an independent source.โ Id. To establish a protected \ninterest in her position as a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board, Cook argues that this Court \nshould apply the analysis in Loudermill and the cases that follow it. ECF 2-1 at 20โ21. In \nLoudermill, the Supreme Court found that a โpublic employee who can be discharged only for \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 29 of 49\ncauseโ had a constitutionally protected property interest in their continued employment. 470 U.S. \nat 535, 538โ39. In that case, the property interest was created by an Ohio statute that entitled the \nemployees to hold their positions โduring good behavior and efficient service,โ and stated that they \ncould not be dismissed โexcept . . . for . . . misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office.โ \nId. at 538โ39. Subsequent cases in this Circuit have followed the logic of Loudermill and have \nreiterated that the basis of the property interest in a government employeeโs position โturns on the \nextent of any substantive limitations on the governmentโs authority to remove her.โ Esparraguera, \n101 F.4th at 33. As is relevant here, courts have found that โa property interest exists if the \nemployee can โbe removed only for cause.โโ Id. (citing Thompson v. District of Columbia, \n530 F.3d 914, 918 (D.C. Cir. 2008)).  \nThe Federal Reserve Act unquestionably provides that a Board Governor is entitled to serve \nfor a fourteen-year term unless they are removed by the President โfor cause.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. \nThe D.C. Circuit has recognized that an employee removable only โfor causeโ has a property \ninterest in their position because they โcan expect to remain employed unless they do something \nwarranting their termination.โ Esparraguera, 101 F.4th at 33. On its face, the reasoning of \nLoudermill and the cases that follow it would seem to apply neatly to Cookโs situation.  \nThe Government does not contest that the โfor causeโ language in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 is of \nthe type that has previously provided federal employees expectations of job security and a due \nprocess-protected property interest. See ECF 13 at 19โ22. Even under the Governmentโs preferred \ninterpretation of the phrase, Cook still had an expectation to serve out the remainder of her \nfourteen-year term โunless [she did] something warranting [her] termination,โ i.e., something that \nweighed negatively on her ability or fitness to do her job as a Federal Reserve Governor. \nEsparraguera, 101 F.4th at 33; see also Marshall J. Breger & Gary J. Edles, Established by \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 30 of 49\nPractice: The Theory and Operation of Independent Federal Agencies, 52 Admin. L. Rev. 1111, \n1147 (2000) (endorsing the notion that โ[if] the [agency] member has a statutory right to continued \nemployment, he or she cannot be deprived of the job without due processโ). \nInstead, the Government argues that the Loudermill analysis does not apply to a Board \nGovernor like Cook because she was acting as a โprincipal officer of the United States, not a mere \nโpublic employee.โโ ECF 13 at 20. The Government claims that it is an established rule that as a \nprincipal officer, Cook had no property interest in her office. ECF 13 at 20. \nThe Court is unable to glean such a rule from the authorities that the Government puts \nforward. Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548 (1900), which the Government cites for the proposition \nthat โpublic offices are mere agencies or trusts, and not property as such,โ dealt with elected \nofficesโin that case, the governor and lieutenant governor of the state of Kentucky. Id. at 570, \n576โ77. Moreover, the claim in Taylor was that the state legislature had denied candidates for \nthose positions due process when resolving a contested election, a context far less analogous to \nCookโs situation than the for cause termination due process precedents. Subsequent cases applying \nTaylor emphasized that it addressed whether โunlawful denial by state action of a right to state \npolitical office is . . . a denial of a right of property.โ Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 7 (1944) \n(emphasis added). Taylor thus does not govern this case. And even modern courts that have \nfollowed Taylorโs holding with respect to cases involving elected officials have noted that since \nTaylor, the Supreme Court โhas adopted a more expansive approach to identifying โpropertyโ in \nthe due process context.โ Velez v. Levy, 401 F.3d 75, 86โ87 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Bd. of Regents \nof State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).  \nNor  does  Crenshaw  v.  United  States,  134  U.S.  99,  104  (1890)โanother  case  the \nGovernment  citesโsupport  applying  the  logic  of  Taylor  to  appointed  officers  like  Cook. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 31 of 49\nCrenshaw involved a cadet who enrolled in the Navy at a time when statutes provided that \nsuccessful graduates would โreceive appointments as midshipmen,โ and that โno officer in the \nmilitary or naval serviceโ would โbe dismissed from the service except upon, and in pursuance of, \nthe sentence of a court-martial to that effect.โ Id. at 100. During the cadetโs training, Congress \nchanged the law and limited the number of cadets who would become officers each year, and as a \nresult, the cadet was not appointed to a midshipman position after graduation. Id. at 101. He sued, \narguing that the change in legislation deprived him of a statutorily-created right to โserve for life, \nor during good behavior.โ Id. at 103. Taking up the case, the Court framed the question as whether \nan โofficer appointed for a definite time, or during good behavior, had any vested interest or \ncontract right in his office of which [C]ongress could not deprive him,โ and found no such right. \nId. at 104.  \nThe text of Crenshaw makes clear that the question was whether, assuming the truth of the \nplaintiffโs argument that he was entitled to lifetime tenure by statute, Congress was prohibited \nfrom passing a law that would modify that tenure. Id. at 104, 109; see Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 \nU.S. 530, 534 (1962) (stating that Crenshaw held that โneither the tenure nor salary of federal \nofficers is constitutionally protected from impairment by Congressโ). There is no inconsistency \nbetween finding a property right in Cookโs โfor causeโ protected position under the existing statute, \nand also acknowledging that Congress, should it desire, would not offend due process by passing \na statute reorganizing the Federal Reserve and eliminating her position. This is because it is \nCongress that has โcreatedโ and โdefinedโ the โdimensionsโ of the property, in this case, through \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 32 of 49\nstatute. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 538. Crenshaw stands merely for the proposition that Congress is \nnot prohibited from amending or repealing the statute that gives rise to the property right.11  \nThe Court thus finds that the existing precedent regarding the protectable rights of public \nofficeholders does not apply to the situation of an independent agency Board member such as \nCook, who, along with the Federal Reserve itself, occupies a unique space in the American \nadministrative structure. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415 (โThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, \nquasi-private entity.โ). Further, the Court must account for the Supreme Courtโs more recent \nprecedents that cast a broader scope as to the protectable interests under the due process clause. \nThe analysis in Loudermill and the cases that follow it do not hinge on the statusโpublic employee \nor officerโof the individuals in question. โLiberty and property are broad and majestic terms,โ \nRoth, 408 U.S. at 571, and the analysis established in Loudermill and Roth, while focused on public \nemployment, was not limited to that context, see id. at 576 (noting that โproperty interestsโ may \nโtake many formsโ). The key issue in these cases was whether the individual had a โlegitimate \nclaim of entitlementโ to the property interest claimed, a claim that may stem from existing statutory \nor regulatory understandings. Id. at 577โ78. The plain language of the Federal Reserve Actโs \nfourteen-year term and โfor causeโ removal provision create that understanding. 12 U.S.C. ยง 242.  \nThe Court thus finds that at this preliminary stage, Cook is likely to succeed on her \nargument that she has a protected property interest in her โfor causeโ-protected role as a member \nof the Board of Governors. \n \n \n11 The discussion of the plaintiffโs alleged property right in Crenshaw is also likely dicta. The Court in Crenshaw \naddressed whether the plaintiff had a โvested interest or contract right in his office,โ id. at 104, only because it was \nassuming that โthe term of office enjoyed by the [plaintiff] was what he claims it to have been,โa term for life,โ id. \nat 109. But the Court went on to find that โeven if that were true as to other officers,โ it was not true for the plaintiff \nin that case, because he had โexecuted a bond to serve for eight years, unless discharged by competent authority,โ and \ntherefore should have โrecogniz[ed] his liability to be discharged.โ Id.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 33 of 49\nii.  Cook Did Not Receive Sufficient Process for Her Removal. \nHaving  determined  that  Cook  was  deprived  of  a  protected  interest,  the  Court  must \ndetermine โwhether she received the process she was due.โ Esparraguera, 101 F.4th at 33 (citing \nBd. of Trs. of UDC, 56 F.3d at 1471). โDue process is flexible and calls for such procedural \nprotections as the particular situation demands.โ Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976). \nIn determining proper process, a Court must balance (1) the private interest affected by the \ngovernment action; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation and the value of additional safeguards; \nand (3) the governmentโs interest, including the fiscal and financial burdens that additional or \nsubstitute procedural requirements would entail. Propert v. District of Columbia, 948 F.2d 1327, \n1332 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (citing Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335). โAn essential principle of due process is \nthat a deprivation of life, liberty, or property โbe preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing \nappropriate to the nature of the case.โโ Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542 (quoting Mullane v. Cent. \nHanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313 (1950)). The opportunity to be heard must be given \nโat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.โ Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 \n(1965). \nCook argues that she was at minimum entitled to โoral or written notice of the charges,โ an \nโexplanation of the . . . evidence,โ and โan opportunity to present [her] side of the story,โ as were \nthe discharged individuals in Loudermill. 470 U.S. at 546; see ECF 2-1 at 20. The Government \nretorts that, even if applicable to Cookโs case, those requirements were satisfied here. It asserts \nthat notice was provided when the President โpublicized the FHFA referral on August 20, 2025.โ \nECF 13 at 22. Recall, that was the date that President Trump shared a Bloomberg news story on \nhis social media platform about Director Pulteโs referral letter and stated โCook must resign, \nnow!!!โ Id. (citing ECF 1 ยถ 43โ44). As for opportunity to be heard, the Government appears to \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 34 of 49\nargue that this requirement was satisfied by the fact that President Trump waited five days after \nhis August 20 Truth Social post โbefore proceeding with the threatened termination.โ ECF 13 at \n5, 23. The Government argues that Cook had the opportunity to contest the allegations in the days \nbefore the President fired her and simply failed to do so. Id.  \nThe Court finds that the due process requirements laid out by the Supreme Court in \nLoudermill apply to Cookโs case. And based on the record currently before it, the Court doubts \nthat Cook received any notice or opportunity to be heard, let alone notice and a hearing that were \nconstitutionally โmeaningful.โ Esparraguera, 101 F.4th at 33. It is difficult to construe President \nTrumpโs social media post on August 20, 2025, which itself linked to a third-party news article \nregarding Director Pulteโs allegations, as โwritten notice of the charges against [her].โ Loudermill, \n470 U.S. at 546. While President Trumpโs comments to reporters on August 22 arguably indicated \nthat President Trump was considering firing Cook, they fall short of providing Cook with an \nโexplanation of the . . . evidenceโ that President Trump was considering in weighing his dismissal \ndecision. Id.; see Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624, 627 (1977) (โThe purpose of such notice and \nhearing is to provide the person an opportunity to clear h[er] name.โ). Even if President Trumpโs \nstatements could be considered as having incorporated Director Pulteโs August 20, 2025, social \nmedia post, this was also insufficient notice. Pulteโs post included a screenshot of two pages of an \napparently longer letter sent to the Department of Justice, which itself contained corresponding \nexhibits. ECF 1-2 at 2โ3. The Government does not claim that President Trump, Director Pulte, or \ntheir staff sent the referral letter or its supporting materials to Cook, despite the fact that the \nPresident cited and incorporated the DOJ referral letter in his letter informing Cook of her \ntermination. ECF 1-3 at 2. Thus, on the record currently before the Court, it appears that President \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 35 of 49\nTrump did not provide her with the โevidence that formed the factual basis of her removal.โ \nEsparraguera, 101 F.4th at 40.  \nThe Government argues that Cook has received actual notice of the allegations against her \nand President Trumpโs intention to remove her. See ECF 23 at 16 (citing United Student Aid Funds, \nInc.  v.  Espinosa,  559  U.S.  260,  272  (2010)  (finding  under  the  circumstances  that  โactual \nnotice . . . more than satisfied [the partyโs] due process rightsโ)). The Court disagrees. The point \nof notice in the termination cases is to provide the employee โnotice of the charges against themโ \nand โexplanation of the employerโs evidence,โ Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546, so as to โprovide the \nperson an opportunity to clear h[er] nameโ Velger, 429 U.S. at 627. The Court is highly doubtful \nthat Cook should have been required to piece together the evidentiary basis for a โfor causeโ \nremoval from a scattered assortment of social media posts and news articles.  \nEven  if  the  notice  provided  had  been  sufficient,  Cookโs  due  process  rights  were \nnevertheless likely violated because she was not given a โmeaningful opportunityโ to be heard. \nLoudermill, 470 U.S. at 543. At no point did President Trump indicate that Cook would be \nprovided an opportunity to argue that the allegations were untrue or did not merit removal, or invite \nCook to submit such evidence. See id. at 543โ46 (requiring that, at minimum, the pretermination \nopportunity to be heard should allow for a โmeaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the \ndecisionmakerโ and include sufficient process to allow the decisionmaker to determine โwhether \nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support \nthe proposed actionโ). Instead, shortly after Director Pulteโs social media post was made public, \nPresident Trump called for Cook to resignโa far cry from inviting an opportunity to contest the \nallegations. See ECF 1 ยถ 44. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 36 of 49\nHaving found that Cook likely did not receive any due process in her removal, the Court \ncould stop there. The Court need not at this preliminary posture identify the โprecise form of notice \nand the precise kind of hearing requiredโ by the Due Process Clause for a โfor causeโ protected \nagency board member. Propert, 948 F.2d at 1332. However, a preliminary consideration of the \ntraditional Mathews factors further demonstrates why it makes sense to apply the Loudermill \nframework to Cookโs case, and why an individual in Cookโs position is likely entitled to at least \nas much process as the individuals in Loudermill.  \n First, much like the employee in Loudermill, Cookโs โprivate interest in retainingโ her \ntenure-protected position is strong. 470 U.S. at 543. And unlike the employees in Loudermill, \nwhose interest in retaining employment was significant despite the fact that they โmay find \nemployment elsewhere,โ Cookโs role as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors is \nnot easily replaceable. See id. Second, considering the risk of erroneous deprivation and the \nbenefits of additional safeguards, as in Loudermill, โsome opportunity for [Cook] to present [her] \nside of the case is . . . of obvious value in reaching an accurate decision,โ given that โ[d]ismissals \nfor cause will often involve factual disputes.โ Id.  \n  The third Mathews factor, the โgovernmentโs interest,โ is far more complicated in this case. \nAssuming for the purpose of the analysis that President Trump had shown sufficient cause to \nremove  Cook,  President  Trump  undoubtedly  shares  the  same  interest  as  the  employer  in \nLoudermill, the โexpeditious removal of an unsatisfactoryโ Board member and โthe avoidance of \nadministrative burdens.โ 470 U.S. at 543. In addition, as the head of the Executive Branch, \nPresident Trump has significant interests in effectively exercising the โexecutive Powerโ and \ncarrying out his obligations under the Take Care Clause, see U.S. Const. art. II, ยงยง 1, 3, which \npoint in favor of expeditious removal in cases where the actions meriting removal are serious or \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 37 of 49\negregious. Thus, the interest in expeditious removal weighs heavily in favor of President Trump. \nOn the other hand, the potential administrative burdens of providing notice and a hearing to Cook \ndo not weigh as strongly in the Presidentโs favor. This is the first โfor causeโ removal in the Federal \nReserveโs  history.  Contested  โfor  causeโ  removals  of  other  independent  agency  and  board \nmembersโspecifically on the basis that they met the statutory standard for removalโhave been \nfew and far between. See Breger & Edles at 1149โ50. The infrequency of these kinds of removals \n(compared to the entire Ohio civil service in Loudermill, or recipients of federal disability benefits \nin Mathews, where the burdens pointed in favor of less elaborate hearing procedures) indicates \nthat the total โsocietal costsโ to the Government of providing notice and a hearing in cases like \nCookโs  would  be  lowโeven  were  the  hearing  to  be  one  that  involved  formal  evidentiary \npresentation. Mathews, 424 U.S. at 347; see Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 535. Moreover, as discussed \nbelow, there is historical precedent for robust pre-removal procedures that do not unduly infringe \non the Presidentโs prerogatives but still comport with the requirements of due process.  \nFurther,  the  interests  of  the  President  as  chief  executive  represent  only  part  of  the \nGovernmentโs interest in this case. See Mathews, 424 U.S. at 347 (defining the relevant interest as \nthe โpublic interestโ). Also at play are the interests of Congress, which enacted the โfor causeโ \nprovision in the first place and thus made a deliberate choice to structure the Federal Reserve Board \nof Governors as an independent body โfree to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance \nof any other official or any department of the government.โ Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 625โ\n26. Congress thus has an interest in ensuring the fair treatment of the Board members by the \nExecutive Branch. While not all of the considerations in analyzing the Mathews factors point in \nher favor, on balance, they support providing Cook and those in a similar position a pre-deprivation \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 38 of 49\nopportunity to contest the record and determine whether the factual allegations indeed state a \nstatutorily required โcause.โ   \nIndeed,  the  limited  historical  practice  that  exists  regarding  removals  of  โfor  causeโ \nprotected officials suggests that a โfor causeโ removal by the President ought to comport with due \nprocess indicia like a formal evidentiary hearing, and that such a requirement would not be \nantithetical to the Presidentโs legitimate ability to remove officials who fail to meet the standard. \nSee Lee v. Garland, 120 F.4th 880, 891 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (โHistorical practice is important in \ndetermining the scope of executive power.โ). In 1913, President Taft removed two members of the \nBoard of Appraisers, who were protected from removal except for INM grounds, following an \nextensive inquiry by an investigative committee which involved fact-gathering, public hearings, \nand consideration of the membersโ rebuttals. See Aditya Bamzai, Taft, Frankfurter, and the First \nPresidential For-Cause Removal, 52 U. Rich. L. Rev. 691, 729โ37 (2018). Taft removed the \nofficers  following  the  committeeโs  final  report  and  Taftโs  finding  that  the  committee  had \nโsustainedโ the charges against the suspect board members. Id. at 737. When President Ford \nconsidered removing a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board that enjoyed protections limiting \nremoval to INM grounds, the Executive Branch requested that the board member participate in an \nโevidence-gathering inquiryโ presided over by the office of the White House Counsel. See Timm \nv. United States, 223 Ct. Cl. 639, 639โ40 (1980) (noting that Timm resigned before such a hearing \nwas held); see also Breger & Edles at 1150. The Court notes that these actual and proposed \nprocedures granted the removed officer a significant opportunity to confront the evidence against \nthem and make their case. They did not require that the President be the one to engage in fact-\ngathering and compilation of the evidence, and thus minimized the burden on the Presidentโs time \nand energy. However, at least in the case of the Taft removals, the President still had a key role in \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 39 of 49\nmaking a final review of the evidence and the officersโ rebuttals. While the Court declines to \nestablish the process due to Cook, it observes that these examples of historical executive process \ninclude the hallmarks of due processโmeaningful notice and an opportunity to be heard. \nBecause Cook received neither of these โfundamental due process requirement[s]โ with \nrespect to her termination, she is substantially likely to succeed on the merits of her due process \nclaim. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546.12  \nB.  Cook Faces Irreparable Harm. \nIn addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits, Cook must also establish that \nshe faces irreparable injury absent the requested preliminary relief. Natโl Min. Assโn v. Jackson, \n768 F. Supp. 2d 34, 50 (D.D.C. 2011); Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297. To constitute irreparable \ninjury,  the  injury  โmust  be  โboth  certain  and  great,โ  โactual  and  not  theoretical,โ  โbeyond \nremediation,โ and โof such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief to \nprevent  irreparable  harm.โโ  Mexichem  Specialty  Resins,  Inc.  v.  EPA,  787  F.3d  544,  555 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297). \n  The Court agrees with Cookโs argument that preventing her from discharging her duties as \na Federal Reserve Governor, a unique Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed role with \nsignificant responsibility, itself constitutes irreparable harm remediable only by her reinstatement. \nThe Government first contends that this theory of harm is barred by the Supreme Courtโs decision \nin Sampson v. Murray, which held that a federal employee seeking injunctive relief must โmake a \nshowing of irreparable injury sufficient in kind and degree to overrideโ the โobviously disruptive \n \n12 The Government argues that Cookโs due process challenge should fail because she has not identified arguments or \nevidence that would have changed the outcome in her case. First, the Court notes that Cook denies that she committed \nmortgage fraud, and is entitled to present evidence to the contrary at the proper time and place. ECF 17 at 15. Second, \nand more importantly, the โright to a hearing does not depend on a demonstration of certain success.โ Loudermill, 470 \nU.S. at 544. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 40 of 49\neffect which the grant of the temporary relief . . . [is] likely to have on the administrative process.โ \n415 U.S. 61, 83โ84 (1974). In Sampson, the Court noted that this concern would typically โcut[] \nagainst the general availability of preliminary injunctions in Government personnel cases.โ Id. \nSampson dealt with the firing of a probationary employee, who had failed to establish irreparable \nharm beyond mere economic loss or reputational harm. Id. at 62, 91โ92. But Sampson held out \nthat there may well be cases that โso far depart from the normal situation that irreparable injury \nmight be found,โ and that a district court will have the authority to grant injunctive relief โin [that] \ngenuinely extraordinary situation.โ Id. at 92 n.68. \n  Cook is correct that other courts in this district have almost uniformly found irreparable \nharm sufficient to meet the โgenuinely extraordinaryโ exception in Sampson, id., when confronted \nwith a claim that an official is being wrongfully deprived of their โstatutory right to function,โ \nparticularly when the official occupies a Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed, fixed-term \nrole.

These \ncourts have found that being removed from a โPresidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed, high-\nranking,  public  servant  roleโ  is  โdifferent  in  caliber  and  kind  fromโ  the  typical  employee \nreinstatement cases. Slaughter, 2025 WL 1984396, at *18. This is because these roles involve the \nโability to influence federal decision-makingโ at a high level. Id. \nMany of these cases have also found it appropriate to take into account the harm that the \nofficialโs removal would have on the agency or board and its ability to function. See, e.g., Berry, \n1983 WL 538, at *5 (finding irreparable harm partially because โthe Commissionโs ability to fulfill \nits mandate [was] disrupted by the [plaintiffsโ] removal,โ which left the Commission โwithout a \nquorumโ);  LeBlanc,  2025  WL  1454010,  at  *32  (finding  irreparable  harm  where  removals \nโimped[ed] the ability of the [board] to function as an independent watchdog . . . as envisioned by \nCongressโ); Harris, 775 F.

Permitting her removal necessarily destroys that \nlegislatively crafted independence in a way that injures [Plaintiff], the FTC, and Congress.โ).  \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 42 of 49\nThe Government counters that the decisions embracing the kinds of harm Cook alleges \nhere should not have persuasive force because many of them have been stayed on appeal. ECF 13 \nat 25โ26. That is not the whole story. In several of the cases a stay was either not granted or not \nsought by the Government in the first place, meaning that they have persuasive value. See Aviel, \n780 F. Supp. 3d at 14; Aviel, 2025 WL 2374618, at *15; see also Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5, \nvacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir 1983). In one of the cases, the D.C. Circuit stayed the \nlower courtโs decision but did not include any reasoning for doing so beyond citing to the \ntraditional stay factors, leaving this Court unable to determine how and whether the grant of the \nstay weighs on the merits of Cookโs case. Harper v. Bessent, No. 25-5268, 2025 WL 2426660, at \n*1 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 21, 2025). Such a stay order is โnot a decision on the merits.โ Merrill v. \nMilligan, 142 S. Ct. 879, 879 (2022) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in grant of application for stays).  \nAs for the cases that have been stayed, the Court is not persuaded that those stay decisions \nundermine the district courtsโ logic on irreparable harm as applied to this case. To start, the \nSupreme Courtโs stay order in Trump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415, does not speak to whether \nCook has adequately demonstrated irreparable harm here. In Wilcox, the Supreme Court granted \nstays of two district courtsโ reinstatements of members of the National Labor Relations Board and \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board because (1) the plaintiffs had failed to show that they would \nsucceed on their merits challenges, which are significantly different from Cookโs, and (2) because \nthe  harms  to  the  plaintiffs  from  โbeing  unable  to  perform  [their]  statutory  dut[ies]โ  were \noutweighed by the โgreater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue \nexercising the executive power.โ Id. Wilcox did not directly address whether the harm to the \nremoved  officer  was  irreparable,  and  only  stated  that  such  a  harm  did  not  outweigh  the \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 43 of 49\nGovernmentโs greater harm in having the removed officer โexercise the executive power.โ Id.13 \nThe Government notes  that Chief Justice Roberts recently issued an administrative stay in \nSlaughter, one of the district court cases supporting Cookโs theory of irreparable harm, pending \nfull briefing of the Governmentโs request to either stay the district courtโs judgment or grant \ncertiorari before judgment. See Trump v. Slaughter, No. 25A264, 2025 WL 2582814, (U.S. Sept. \n8, 2025); ECF 26. But a nonprecedential administrative stay order provides no basis to doubt the \nlogic of Slaughter as applied to this case. United States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. 797, 798 (2024) \n(Barrett, J. concurring in denial of applications to vacate stay) (โAdministrative stays do not \ntypically reflect the courtโs consideration of the merits of the stay application.โ).  \nCookโs argument is also not foreclosed by the D.C. Circuitโs decision staying the district \ncourtโs  order  in  Dellinger  v.  Bessent.  See  No.  25-5052,  2025  WL  887518,  at  *4 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar 10, 2025).  In  that  decision,  the  Circuit  granted  a  stay  of  the  district  courtโs \nreinstatement of Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger. The Circuit held that even if Dellingerโs \nremoval had been ultra vires, โthat [did] not mean such injury [was] irreparable and weigh[ed] in \nhis favor.โ Id. The panel held that the circumstances in that case โcut in favor of a stayโ pending \nappeal because, โ[a]t worst, Dellinger would remain out of office for a short period of time.โ Id. \nThe Circuit contrasted Dellingerโs harms with the substantial harms to the government of having \nits replacement special counsel โsidelined and unable to act while also having to try and unravel \nDellingerโs actions.โ Id.  \n \n13 For the same reasons, the stay in Trump v. Boyle does not resolve the question in this case, premised as it was on \nthe analysis in Wilcox that the โConsumer Product Safety Commission exercises executive powerโ in a similar manner \nas the National Labor Relations Board. 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025). And because the harm analysis in the LeBlanc \nand Grundmann stays by the D.C. Circuit were premised on the balance of harms theory endorsed by Wilcox, and did \nnot address the merits of the plaintiffsโ irreparable harm arguments, they do not provide reason to doubt the district \ncourtsโ analyses on that issue. See LeBlanc v. U.S. Priv. & C.L. Oversight Bd., No. 25-5197, 2025 WL 1840591, at *2 \n(D.C. Cir. July 1, 2025); Grundmann v. Trump, No. 25-5165, 2025 WL 1840641, at *1 (D.C. Cir. July 3, 2025), \nreconsideration en banc denied, No. 25-5165, 2025 WL 1995785 (D.C. Cir. July 16, 2025). \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 44 of 49\nThe โcircumstances of [this] particular caseโ differ from those of Dellingerโs and point in \nfavor of finding irreparable harm. Id. First, in the Circuitโs decision in Dellinger, as in Wilcox, the \nquestion before the D.C. Circuit was not the merits of Dellingerโs irreparable harm argument as \nendorsed by the district court below, but whether to grant the Governmentโs motion for a stay \npending appeal. The panelโs decision primarily focused on the balance of the equities. Id. at *2 \n(considering the issue as โweighing the relative harmโ). The panel found this prong supported the \nGovernmentโs stay โin the circumstances of [that] particular case,โ because of the strength of the \nGovernmentโs injury. Id. at *4. But here, the calculus is substantially different. In Dellinger, the \nplaintiff was the head of an independent agency that was nevertheless closely entwined with the \nrest of the Executive Branch. Upon his reinstatement by the district court, the plaintiff in Dellinger \nwas continuing to use his statutory powers as Special Counsel to stay the administrationโs \npersonnel decisions, and his reinstatement was thus found to pose significant and direct disruption \nto the administrationโs policy program and personnel decisions. Id. at *3. Cookโs retention on the \nBoard of Governors does not pose the same harms. She is one member of a multi-member body \nthat the Government concedes cannot be subject to policy pressure from the rest of the Executive \nBranch. Thus, her continued presence on the Board does not cause a similar degree of harm. \nFinally, in Dellinger, the Circuitโs stay addressed only one harm to Dellinger, the deprivation of \nhis โstatutory right to function in office,โ but Cook here presents additional harms that flow from \nthis  deprivation  that  the  D.C.  Circuit  did  not  consider,  including  those  to  the  agencyโs \nindependence and the possibility that President Trump will shortly move to replace her on the \nBoard. ECF 2-1 at 21โ22.  \nCook has shown irreparable harm. Through her removal, โshe has lost the ability to fulfill \na high-ranking, public-servant role to which she is entitled.โ Aviel, 2025 WL 2374618, at *15. As \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 45 of 49\na member of the Board of Governors, she has the โability to influence federal decision-makingโ \non issues of monetary policy, and serves as part of a โcongressionally protected agency that is \ndesigned to operate โindependent of executive authority.โโ Slaughter, 2025 WL 1984396, at *18 \n(citing Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 625). She has โlost the power to guide,โ along with the other \nmembers of the Board of Governors, a โ[]century-old independent agency that serves the United \nStatesโโ interests in expert-driven monetary policy and banking stability. Aviel, 2025 WL 2374618, \nat *15. โLosingโ her โrole at an independent agency like theโ Federal Reserve, id. at *16, does not \ncompare to other employee terminations that  were not deemed irreparable, like that of the \nprobationary employee in Sampson. 415 U.S. at 90โ92. Her removal from the Board will result in \nmissed votes and lost time that cannot be remedied by backpay or reinstatement after the fact. See \nHarper, 2025 WL 2049207, at *13 (finding that similar injuries โcannot be retroactively cured by \nmonetary damagesโ). The Court agrees with the many others in this district that Cookโs removal \nqualifies as irreparable harm sufficient to support preliminary relief in the form of reappointment \nto her position. As a result, the Court need not address Cookโs remaining grounds for irreparable \nharm at this time.14  \nC.  The Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest Favor Cookโs Requested \nRelief. \n \nThe final two stay factors, which merge here, strongly cut in Cookโs favor. Cook has \ndemonstrated an ongoing irreparable harm. Against that harm, the Government raises Wilcox, \nBoyle, and the D.C. Circuitโs stay in Dellinger, to argue that the Government suffers a greater harm \n \n14 The Courtโs analysis on irreparable harm applies both to Cookโs claim that her removal was not โfor causeโ and \nthat she did not receive constitutionally sufficient process. The loss of her unique statutory position results from either \nviolation, a conclusion that the Government conceded at oral argument. See Hrโg Tr. at 72:21โ73:7 (noting, in response \nto the Courtโs question about whether the due process violation is itself a form of irreparable harm, that the harm was \nsimilar to the statutory-right-to-function cases, because โthe thing that is being deprived is the office or the \nemployment, which is the same thing as in all the other removal cases that weโve been talking aboutโ). \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 46 of 49\nin โallowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully \nremoved officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.โ ECF 13 at 25 (citing \nWilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415). It also raises the โdisruptive effect of the repeated removal and \nreinstatement of officers during the pendency of this litigation.โ Id. at 29 (citing Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. \nat 1415).  \nAgain, the Court is not persuaded that the harms cash out here as they did in Wilcox and \nBoyle. First, Cookโs retention on the Board of Governors does not offend the Presidentโs Article II \nauthority in the way the officersโ reinstatement was found to in Wilcox and Boyle. See supra n.13. \nWilcoxโs theory of harm was premised on the ground that the Government suffered from having a \nreinstated officer exercise the โexecutive power.โ Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415. But the Supreme \nCourt in Wilcox expressly disclaimed that its analysis on this issue implicated the โuniquely \nstructured, quasi-private entityโ that is the Federal Reserve. Id. Here, Cook is one of seven \nmembers of a Board that is, by design, not intended to be susceptible to policy pressure, let alone \ntasked with implementing the Presidentโs agenda. One could frame the Governmentโs harm as an \ninjury to the Presidentโs ability to faithfully execute the laws, which is undermined by being \nrequired to retain an individual on the Federal Reserve Board in whom he has stated that he lacks \nconfidence. But even in that case, the fact remains that in failing to specify legal โcause,โ President \nTrump has not identified anything related to Cookโs conduct or job performance as a Board \nmember that would indicate that she is harming the Board or the public interest by executing her \nduties unfaithfully or ineffectively. The Governmentโs claimed injuries carry less weight here than \nin Wilcox and Boyle. Dellinger also does not govern this case for the reasons discussed above.  \nFurther, the public interest in this case is not only limited to the interests of the Executive \nBranch. โ[T]here is a substantial public interest in having governmentalโ actors like the President \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 47 of 49\nโabide by the federal laws.โ League of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)). Congress, \nwhich  implemented  the  โfor  causeโ  protection  and  sought  to  secure  the  Federal  Reserveโs \nindependence, also has an interest in ensuring that Federal Reserve Board members are removed \nfor only statutorily permitted reasons, and preventing the President from โthwart[ing] . . . the very \nends which Congress sought to realize by definitively fixing the term of office.โ Humphreyโs Exโr, \n295 U.S. at 626.  \nFurther, the public interest in Federal Reserve independence weighs in favor of Cookโs \nreinstatement. That independence is critical in helping the nationโs โbanking system to promote \nstability.โ PHH Corp., 881 F.3d at 92 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 74-742, at 1). As Justice Kavanaugh \nhas observed, insulation of the Federal Reserve from โdirect presidential oversight or controlโ \nโmay be worthwhile,โ due to โits power to directly affect the short-term functioning of the U.S. \neconomy  by  setting  interest  rates  and  adjusting  the  money  supply.โ  Brett  M.  Kavanaugh, \nSeparation of Powers During the Forty-Fourth Presidency and Beyond, 93 Minn. L. Rev. 1454, \n1474 (2009). Others have put it more bluntly: Given this significant power and responsibility, \nโ[s]ubjecting the Fed[eral Reserve] to close political oversight would likely have harmful, perhaps \neven disastrous, consequences.โ Neil H. Buchanan & Michael C. Dorf, Donโt End or Audit the \nFed: Central Bank Independence in an Age of Austerity, 102 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 8 (2016). \nThe Court finds that the equitable factors weigh in favor of granting relief to Cook. \nD.  The Court Will Enter a Preliminary Injunction Against Defendants Powell and \nthe Board of Governors. \n \nBecause all four factors favor Cook, the Court will grant relief in her favor, in the form of \na preliminary injunction requiring Defendants Powell and the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve to allow Cook to remain a member of the Board during the pendency of this litigation. \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 48 of 49\nThe Court acknowledges that Cook originally moved for a temporary restraining order. ECF 2. \nHowever, since then, the Court has held an adversarial hearing and received additional responsive \nbriefing from both Parties. See Aug. 29, 2025 Min. Entry; ECF 13, 17, 23, 24. Further, in the \nPartiesโ joint status report, counsel for the Government noted that they would not object to \nconverting Cookโs temporary restraining order motion into a request for a preliminary injunction, \nECF 20 at 3. The legal standard for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction are \nthe same. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 844 F. Supp. 2d at 101. โWhen the opposing party actually receives \nnotice of the application for a restraining order, the procedure that is followed does not differ \nfunctionally from that on an application for a preliminary injunction and the proceeding is not \nsubject to any special requirements.โ 11A Wright & Millerโs Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 2951 \n(3d ed. 2025). Here, given that there has been an adversarial hearing and additional briefing, \nCookโs request will be treated as one for a preliminary injunction. See id.  \n  The Court recognizes that it likely cannot directly โenjoin the President in the performance \nof his official dutiesโ to require him to reappoint Cook. Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042 \n(D.C. Cir. 2023) (citing Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802 (1992) (plurality opinion)). \nHowever, Cook can still be granted relief because the Circuit has recognized that a court can \nโenjoin โsubordinate executive officialsโ to reinstate a wrongly terminated official โde facto,โ even \nwithout a formal presidential reappointment.โ Id. at 1042โ43 (citing Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d \n973, 980 (1996)).  \nTherefore, the Court will enter an injunction directing Powell and the Board of Governors \nto allow Cook to continue to operate as a member of the Board for the pendency of this litigation. \nThe Government has requested that this Court stay its decision pending any appeal. ECF 20 at 3. \nThe Court declines to do so. The Court recognizes that this case involves the first โfor causeโ \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 49 of 49\nremoval of a Federal Reserve Board Governor, and as a result, raises important matters of first \nimpression. However, for the reasons stated in this opinion, the Court finds that the balance of \nequities would not be in the Governmentโs favor. Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffโs motion for a temporary restraining order, ECF 2, is \nconstrued as a motion for a preliminary injunction, and is GRANTED. \nA separate order accompanies this memorandum opinion. \nSO ORDERED.  \n                       __________________________ \n              JIA M.

The President removed Cook for cause under 12 \nU.S.C. ยง 242 after detailing misrepresentations Cook had made in mortgage \napplicationsโmisrepresentations that would constitute mortgage fraud if \nmade knowingly, and that at a minimum reflect a lack of care in financial \nmatters that the President determined was inconsistent with Cookโs holding \na position of public financial trust on the Federal Reserve Board.  The \ndistrict court nonetheless preliminarily enjoined Cookโs removal, holding \nthat the President lacked cause to remove Cook because she made the \nmisrepresentations before she assumed office and that Cook had not been \nafforded sufficient notice or an opportunity to be heard before the \nPresident removed her.  That extraordinary order countermanding the \nPresidentโs exercise of his Article II authority rests on a series of legal errors \nand should be stayed pending appeal. \nFirst, under longstanding Supreme Court precedent, when a statute \ngives a power of removal โfor cause,โ without any specification of the \ncauses, the removal decision โis a matter of discretion and not reviewable.โ \nReagan v. United States, 182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901).  And even if the decision \n \n\n \nwere reviewable, Cook would have to show that the President acted ultra \nviresโi.e., contrary to a specific statutory prohibition that is clear and \nmandatoryโa standard that Cook does not come close to satisfying.     \nSecond, under any standard, the President had clear cause to remove \nCook from office.  As a Governor, Cook serves on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee which โhas exclusive control over the open market operations of \nthe entire Federal Reserve System,โ which โaffects the ability of banks to \nmake loans and investmentsโ and โhas a substantial impact on interest \nrates and investment activity in the economy as a whole.โ  Federal Open \nMarket Committee of Federal Reserve System v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340, \n343-44 (1979).  Here, the evidenceโwhich Cook has yet to offer contrary \nexplanation forโwas that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, \nand was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where \nshe lived.  Op. 5.  Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or \nduring office, it indisputably calls into question Cookโs trustworthiness and \nwhether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy \nfor the whole Nation.  Indeed, the district court had no problem confirming \nthat the President would have cause to remove Cook if she was convicted of \nmortgage fraud based on her conduct before taking office.  Op. 21-22.  \nCriminal conviction is not a prerequisite for removal under 12 U.S.C. ยง 242, \n2 \n\n \nand the President acted lawfully in removing Cook from office. \nThird, there is no basis under the Due Process Clause for enjoining \nthe Presidentโs removal of a principal officer.  Cook does not hold a \npersonal property interest in her position, as a โpublic office is not \npropertyโ and her role as a principal officer โto the public is inconsistent \nwith either a property or a contract right.โ  Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. \n548, 576-77 (1900).  And here, the President clearly made public both the \nfactual basis for his concern and his judgment that Cookโs conduct \nconstituted grounds for removal.  Cook does not allege that she sought to \noffer any evidence to the President or anyone else that would explain her \nactions, either after the President first called on her to resign, see Dkt. 1 at \n14, ยถยถ 44-46, or even through this litigation.  For a โhearing mandated by \nthe Due Process Clause [] to serve any useful purpose, there must be some \nfactual dispute,โ and โthe absence ofโ materially disputed facts โis fatal to \n[plaintiffโs] claim under the Due Process Clause that [she] should have been \ngiven a hearing.โ  Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624, 627 (1977).  \nFinally, the Supreme Court has established that the balance of \nequities favors the government when a district court reinstates a removed \nprincipal officer.  Trump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (2025); Trump v. \nBoyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653 (2025).  The equitable calculus is identical here.  See \n3 \n\n \nGrundmann v. Trump, 2025 WL 1840641, at *1 (D.C. Cir. July 3, 2025) \n(granting a stay pending appeal because โ[t]he Supreme Courtโs reasoning \nfully applies toโ the reinstatement of other principal officers). \nWe respectfully request a stay pending appeal and an immediate \nadministrative stay, consistent with the administrative stays granted in \nTrump v. Wilcox, No. 24A966 (U.S. Apr. 9, 2025), Trump v. Slaughter, No. \n25A264 (U.S. Sept. 8, 2025), and Grundmann v. Trump, No. 25-5165 (D.C. \nCir. June 18, 2025), which similarly involved district court orders \nreinstating principal officers who had been removed by the President.  We \nalso respectfully request that the Court act on the request for an \nadministrative stay or a stay pending appeal by the close of business on \nMonday, September 15, 2025, as the Federal Open Market Committeeโ\nwhich includes the Board of Governorsโis scheduled to meet and may \ndirect open market activities for Federal Reserve Banks on September 16.   \nSTATEMENT \n1. There are seven Governors on the Board of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, all appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.  12 U.S.C. ยงยง 241-242.  Governors serve staggered fourteen-year \nterms, โunless sooner removed for cause by the President.โ  Id. ยง 242.  \nโ[T]he Government does not contest the constitutionality of the โfor causeโ \n4 \n\n \nremoval restrictions for [the] Board Governors.โ  Op. 9. \nThe Federal Reserve Governors โoverse[e] the operations of the \nregional Reserve Banks, including by setting policies for Reserve Banksโ \nlending of money to private banks and provision of other financial \nservices,โ while also โregulat[ing] certain private financial institutions and \nactivities.โ  Appointment and Removal of Federal Reserve Bank Members \nof the Federal Open Market Committee, 43 Op. O.L.C. ___, 2019 WL \n11594453, at *2 (Oct. 23, 2019).  All the Governors and five presidents of \nthe regional Reserve Banks serve on the Federal Open Market Committee, \nwhich โexpands [and] contracts the supply of money in the United States.โ  \nId. at *3.  This occurs through open market operations that raise and lower \ninterest rates, which โhas a โsubstantial impactโ on โinvestment activity in \nthe economy as a whole,โโ id., making these operations โthe most important \nmonetary policy instrument of the Federal Reserve System,โ Merrill, 443 \nU.S. at 343; see also 12 U.S.C. ยง 263.   \n2.  In 2023, President Biden nominated Lisa Cook to serve as a \nGovernor and the Senate confirmed her later that year.  Op. 4. On August \n15, 2025, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency sent a \nreferral letter to the Department of Justice raising evidence of apparent \nmortgage fraud by Cook based on misstatements in her mortgage \n5 \n\n \nagreements before she was nominated and confirmed to the Board.  Op. 5.  \nThe letter stated that in June 2021, Cook had acquired a $203,000 loan for \na property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, based on Cookโs representation that she \nwould โuse the Property as [her] principal residence * * * for at least one \nyear after the date of occupancy.โ  Dkt. 1-2 at 2-3.  Two weeks later, in July \n2021, Cook obtained a $540,000 loan for a second property in Atlanta, \nGeorgia, based on her affirmance that this property would โserve as her \nprimary residence for a full year.โ  Dkt. 1-2 at 3.  The letter stated that this \nGeorgia property was listed for rent in 2022, and Cook โhas not disclosed \nany rental income tied to this address.โ  Id.   \nThe letter was made public on August 20, 2025; that same day, the \nPresident called on Cook to resign.  Op. 5.  The President reiterated that call \ntwo days later in a public interview, stating that he would fire Cook if she \ndid not resign.  Id.  Cook has not made any attempt to explain her actions, \nmeaningfully dispute the allegations, or otherwise clarify how she obtained \n$743,000 in loans for her own benefit by stating that she would live in two \nplaces at once.  \nOn August 25, 2025, the President removed Cook as a Governor for \ncause, because the โAmerican people must be able to have full confidence in \nthe honest of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the \n6 \n\n \nFederal Reserve.โ  Op. 6.  Based on Cookโs misconduct, the President \ndetermined that neither he nor the public could โhave such confidence in \n[her] integrity.โ  Op. 6. \n3.  Cook sued the President, Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal \nReserve, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to enjoin her \nremoval.  Op. 6-7.  Cook moved for a temporary restraining order, but \nbecause the parties were able to engage in briefing and a court hearing, the \ncourt construed the motion as seeking a preliminary injunction.  Op. 2. \nThe district court granted a preliminary injunction, holding that โthe \npermissible grounds โfor causeโ removalโ in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 โare limited to \ngrounds concerning an officialโs behavior in office and whether they have \nbeen faithfully and effectively executing statutory duties.โ  Op. 9.  Because \nthe President removed Cook based on her misconduct before she took \noffice, the court ruled the President likely lacked cause to remove her.  Op. \n26-27.   \nThe court also held that Cookโs removal likely violated due process \nbecause Cook โhas a protected property interest in her โfor causeโ-protected \nrole as a member of the Board of Governors.โ  Op. 32.  Based on that \nconclusion, the court further determined that Cook was entitled to a pre-\ndeprivation hearing before being removed, based on the balancing factors \n7 \n\n \nof Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976).  Op. 33-39.   \nThe court concluded that Cook would face irreparable harm from \nbeing removed from a โunique Presidentially appointed and Senate-\nconfirmed role with significant responsibility,โ Op. 39, and that the equities \nweighed in favor of a preliminary injunction ordering Cookโs reinstatement \nto office, Op. 45-47.  The court denied the governmentโs request for a stay \npending appeal.  Op. 48-49. \nARGUMENT \nIn considering a stay pending appeal, this Court considers four \nfactors: the likelihood of success on the merits, the movantโs irreparable \ninjury, the balance of harms, and the public interest. Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 426 (2009).  Because those factors uniformly favor the \ngovernment, a stay pending appeal is warranted. \nI.  The Government Is Likely To Prevail On The Merits \nA.  The Presidentโs Determination Is Unreviewable \nOr At Most Reviewable Under The Ultra Vires \nStandard \nThe Presidentโs โpower to removeโand thus to superviseโthose who \nwield executive power on his behalfโ is โconclusive and preclusive.โ  Trump \nv. United States, 503 U.S. 593, 608-09 (2024).  โCongress cannot act on, \nand courts cannot examine, the Presidentโs actionsโ within this sphere.  Id.  \nThus the Supreme Court has long held that removal โfor cause,โ but not \n8 \n\n \nfurther specified, โis a matter of discretion and not reviewable.โ  Reagan v. \nUnited States, 182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901).  Accord Montgomery H. Throop, A \nTreatise on the Law Relating to Public Officers ยง 396, at 387 (1892) \n(โ[W]here a statute gives a power of removal โfor cause,โ without any \nspecification of the causes, this power is of a discretionary and judicial \nnature; and unless the statute otherwise specifically provides, the exercise \nthereof cannot be reviewed in any other tribunal, with respect either to the \ncause, or it is sufficiency or existence, or otherwise.โ).   \nReagan considered a court officer who by statute could be removed \nโfor causes prescribed by law,โ 182 U.S. at 424, but Congress had not \nprovided for or further specified such causes, id. at 425-26.  When the \nofficer challenged his removal as unlawful, the Supreme Court affirmed \ndismissal of the case, explaining that โwhen causes are not defined nor \nremoval for cause provided for, [it] is a matter of discretion and not \nreviewable.โ  Id. at 425.  That rule applies here with equal force.   \nIf there were any review, it would be extremely narrow and \ncircumscribed, which even the district court recognized.  Op. 25 \n(recognizing that a court may not review whether a specified permissible \ncause was sufficient to warrant removal).  Indeed, Cookโs complaint does \nnot identify a free-standing statutory cause of action, and her suit boils \n9 \n\n \ndown to a claim that the President acted ultra vires.  That method of review \nis โessentially a Hail Mary passโ and requires Cook to demonstrate that the \nPresident plainly acted โcontrary to a specific prohibition in the statute that \nis clear and mandatory.โ  Changji Esquel Textile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th \n716, 722 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  Cook cannot demonstrate such an โextremeโ \ndeparture from statutory commands, id., and under any standard of review \nthe government is likely to succeed on the merits. \nB.  The President Had Cause To Remove Cook From \nOffice Based On Her Apparent Contradictory \nAttestations Made To Benefit Herself \nAs the district court noted, โfor causeโ has long been understood to \nโrelat[e] to the conduct, ability, fitness, or competence of the officer.โ  Op. \n11 (quoting Blackโs Law Dictionary 796 (3d ed. 1933)) (emphasis added).  \nBut the court fundamentally erred in holding that the President lacked such \ncause for removal here. \nThe Governors of the Federal Reserve System are entrusted with the \ncritical responsibility of managing the money supply of the United States, \nensuring that Federal Reserve notes serve as an elastic currency that can \nmeet the countryโs demand for liquidity, and appropriately using the \npurchase and sale of government securities to reach target interest rates for \nthe economy as a whole.   \n10 \n\n \nCook has been accused of financial misconduct, misrepresenting the \nterms of her personal loans to inure to her own benefit by receiving lower \ninterest rates than might otherwise be offered to her.  Dkt. 1-2 at 2-3.  If \nthose contradictory representations were made knowingly, they could \nconstitute federal felonies.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ยง 1344 (bank fraud); id. \nยง 1014 (false statements to financial institution).  And if they were made \ninadvertently, they still demonstrate lack of care or negligence with respect \nto important financial matters. \nIn this litigation, Cook has offered no meaningful explanation for her \napparent contradictory statements about whether she primarily lived in her \nMichigan house or her Georgia house, both of which she stated would be \nher primary residence for essentially the same time.  Supra pp. 5-6. \nInstead, Cook has proffered that perhaps President Biden and the Senate \nmight have been on inquiry notice of these misstatements at the time of her \nconfirmation, and that her misconduct does not rise to the level of โโmoral \nturpitudeโ or criminal convictions.โ  Dkt. 17 at 13-15.  Nothing in the text of \nโfor causeโ suggests that inquiry notice by a previous President eliminates \nany possible cause, or that only immoral or criminal conduct can be the \nbasis for removal.  \nCookโs apparent financial misconduct constitutes clear cause for the \n11 \n\n \nPresident to consider and ultimately order her removal, and at a minimum \ndemonstrates โthe sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that \ncalls into question [her] competence and trustworthiness as a financial \nregulator.โ  Dkt. 1-4 at 2.  As Alexander Hamilton made clear when \ndiscussing the Federal Reserveโs historical predecessorโthe Bank of the \nUnited Statesโits principals must be entrusted with the โkeen, steady, and, \nas it were, magnetic senseโ of the โprosperity of the institutionโ for โcareful \nand prudent administration,โ because that is the โonly basis on which an \nenlightened, unqualified and permanent confidence can be expected to be \nerected and maintained.โ  3 The Works of Alexander Hamilton 163 (1885 \ned. Henry Cabot Lodge).  When Governors by misconduct or gross neglect \nerode the foundations of such confidence, the President acts properly and \nlawfully by removing them. \nThe district court did not question the ultimate merits of that \njudgment, but instead erroneously held that the President lacked statutory \nauthority to consider Cookโs actions at all because they occurred before she \ntook office.  Op. 26-27.  The court reached that result by reasoning that the \nโfor causeโ removal limitation must be limited to cover only the same \nground as other removal statutes that consider an officialโs actions in office.  \nOp. 13-19 (citing statutes that provide for removal based on โinefficiency, \n12 \n\n \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in officeโ).  But if Congress had wanted to \nlimit cause to only in-office conduct, โit easily could have drafted language \nto that effect,โ as it has done in other statutes.  Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. \nAU Optronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 169 (2014).  Removal โfor causeโ \ncontemplates a broader range of considerations, and indeed the Supreme \nCourt has recognized that a for-cause removal provision โappears to give \nthe President more removal authority than other removal provisions \nreviewed by this Court,โ and specifically contrasted โfor causeโ with \nโinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.โ  Collins v. Yellen, \n594 U.S. 220, 255-56 (2021).   \nThe district court resisted this conclusion, stating that allowing the \nPresident to remove โGovernors from office based on conduct that was \nalready known and ratified through the confirmation process would allow \nforโ the President to remove Governors effectively at will.  Op. 21.  It is \ndifficult to understand the district courtโs concern.  Most individuals do not \ncommit financial fraud, much less those selected to lead the Federal \nReserve.  If an earlier President and earlier Senate had confirmed Bernie \nMadoff or Charles Ponzi to be Federal Reserve Governors, it would blink \nreality to suggest that a later President could not remove them based on \ntheir misdeeds, regardless of whether they occurred in office or not. \n13 \n\n \nThe district court mistakenly viewed the government as โconce[ding] \nthat conduct that was known to the appointing authorities (the President \nand Senate) at the time of a Board memberโs appointment could not be the \nbasis for a later โfor causeโ firing.โ  Op. 19.  But government counsel simply \nsaid that โif it was something that was known at the time, itโs much harder \nto say that itโs cause later because the presumption is that has gone through \nthe political process * * * [b]ut again, thatโs not the facts here.โ  Hearing Tr. \nat 66:4-9 (Aug. 29, 2025).  Counsel also argued that pre-confirmation \nconduct would be cause if it โwas not known at the time of confirmation.โ  \nId. at 66:15-16.  Indeed, Cookโs counsel agreed at the hearing that โfor \ncauseโ did not categorically exclude conduct that predates confirmation.  \nHearing Tr. at 17:10-18:23 (Aug. 29, 2025).  The district courtโs insistence \nthat โfor causeโ must be limited to โcircumstances that have occurred while \n[the Governors] are in office,โ Op. 16, is a categorical definition urged by \nneither party.   \nMoreover, the district courtโs narrow construction of โfor causeโ butts \nup against the Presidentโs โconstitutionally appointed duty to โtake care that \nthe laws be faithfully executedโ under Article II.โ  Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 690 (1988).  A construction of โcauseโ that nevertheless forbids \nthe President from removing a principal officer when there is unrebutted \n14 \n\n \nevidence of serious misconduct would raise substantial questions under \nArticle II.  Cf. John F. Manning, The Independent Counsel Statute: \nReading โGood Causeโ In Light of Article II, 83 Minn. L. Rev. 1285, 1330 \n(1999) (discussing โpersuasive reasonsโ why โa narrow construction of \nโgood causeโ * * * would raise a serious question under Article IIโ). \nIndeed, the district court seemed to recognize these concerns when it \nsuggested that prior misconduct could support removal if it led to a \ncriminal conviction.  Op. 21-22.  While that is obviously true, it is unclear \nwhat textual basis the court used to reach that conclusionโthe misconduct \nwould have already โoccurred before they assumed the position,โ and would \nnot count as the โofficialโs behavior in office,โ which the court had earlier \nconsidered to be the only legal grounds for cause.  Op. 9.   \nThe courtโs acknowledgment that the President may consider pre-\noffice misconduct if it results in extreme consequences underscores that \npre-office misconduct is not categorically off limits.  And once it is agreed \nthat the President may properly remove a Governor based on such \nmisconduct, the district court had no authority to inquire further.  When a \nstatute โcommits decisionmaking to the discretion of the President, judicial \nreview of the Presidentโs decision is not available.โ  Dalton v. Specter, 511 \nU.S. 462, 477 (1994).  Presidential action may be reviewed for compliance \n15 \n\n \nwith the Constitution, but mere claims that the President โhas acted in \nexcess of his statutory authorityโ are not judicially cognizable โwhen the \nstatute in question commitsโ the discretionary decision to โthe President.โ  \nId. at 474.  The court properly recognized that principle when it clarified \nthat it was โnot inquiring into the sufficiency of the evidence presented by \nPresident Trump.โ  Op. 26 n.9; accord United States ex rel. Garland v. \nOliver, 6 Mackey 47, 56 (Sup. Ct. D.C. 1887) (โ[I]f the power to remove is in \nthis President,โ the court lacks power to review โthe sufficiency of the cause \nwhich induce him to remove an officerโ). \nC.  Cook Does Not Have A Due Process Interest In A \nHearing \nThe government is also likely to succeed on Cookโs procedural \nchallenge, as there is no basis under the Due Process Clause for enjoining \nthe Presidentโs removal of a principal officer.  To establish a due process \nviolation, Cook must show that the President โdeprived her of a โliberty or \nproperty interestโ to which she had a โlegitimate claim of entitlement,โ and \nthat โthe procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally \n[in]sufficient.โโ  Roberts v. United States, 741 F.3d 152, 161 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \nCook does not hold a protected property interest in her position, as a \nโpublic office is not propertyโ and her role as a principal officer โto the \npublic is inconsistent with either a property or a contract right.โ  Taylor v. \n16 \n\n \nBeckham, 178 U.S. 548, 576-77 (1900).  The Supreme Court had โlittle \ndifficultyโ deciding that โan officer appointed for a definite time or good \nbehaviorโ did not have any โvested interest or contract right in his officeโ \nand thus could not maintain a due-process claim.  Crenshaw v. United \nStates, 134 U.S. 99, 104 (1890).1  That same analysis defeats Cookโs claim \nhere. \nThe district court erred in holding to the contrary, mistakenly \nreasoning that Cook presented a special case because she is an \nโindependent agency Board Member.โ  Op. 32.  The court held Taylor \ninapposite because it involved โelected offices,โ Op. 30, but Taylorโs \nreasoning was not so limited.  Rather, the Supreme Court rejected a \nproperty right based on โnumerousโ decisions โto the effect that public \noffices are mere agencies or trusts, and not property as such,โ Taylor, 178 \nU.S. at 577, and that rationale that applies to all officers, elected and \nappointed.  Indeed, Taylor began its analysis by discussing how \nโappointedโ officersโwho serve as โagents for the effectuating of such \npublic purposesโโdo not hold โfixed private rights of propertyโ in their \n \n1 These holdings are consistent with the traditional view of state \ncourts that โoffice in this country is not property.โ  Smith v. City of New \nYork, 10 Tiffany 518, 520 (N.Y. 1868); Lynch v. Chase, 40 P. 666, 667 (Kan. \n1895) (the theory that a prison warden โhas a property or vested rightโ in \nthe office โis wholly inconsistent with our system of government.โ). \n17 \n\n \ncontinued office.  Id. at 576 (discussing appointed officers in Butler v. \nPennsylvania, 51 U.S. 402, 403 (1850)). \nThe district court was further mistaken in holding Crenshaw \ninapplicable, suggesting that the case simply concerned whether โCongress \nwas prohibited from passing a law that would modifyโ an officerโs tenure.  \nOp. 31.  But that misses the key point that Crenshaw re-affirmed: a public \noffice does not become private property merely because its incumbent \nenjoys tenure protection.  The naval officer in Crenshaw could be removed \nonly by court-martial, see 134 U.S. at 100, but the Supreme Court held that \nhe had no โvested interestโ or โprivate right of propertyโ in his position, id. \nat 104.   \nThe district court rested its due process holding almost entirely on \nCleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), and \nEsparraguera v. Department of the Army, 101 F.4th 28 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  \nOp. 28-30.  But those cases concerned whether โcivil service employeesโ \nwith statutory tenure protections had โa property right in continued \nemployment.โ  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 538; accord Esparraguera, 101 \nF.4th at 33 (considering whether โa government employee has a \nconstitutionally protected property interest in her positionโ).  Neither \ndecision purports to overrule the Supreme Courtโs earlier precedents \n18 \n\n \nholding that โoffices are * * * not property,โ Taylor, 178 U.S. at 577 \n(emphasis added).  That distinction matters.  It defines how officers may be \nappointed under the Constitution, see U.S. Const. art. II, ยง 2, cl. 2, what \nโsignificant authorityโ they may wield โpursuant to the laws of the United \nStates,โ Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018), and their relationship to \ntheir office as one of public trust, not of a vested property right.  The notion \nthat a principal officer can have a property interest in the authority she \nwields is โalien to the concept of a republican form of government.โ  Barnes \nv. Kline, 759 F.2d at 50 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Bork, J., dissenting).  \nAnd at bottom, Cook still does not explain what difference a hearing \nwould have made.  Cook complains that she was denied a chance to make \nher case, but she does not allege that she sought to offer any evidence to the \nPresident or anyone else that would explain her actions, see Dkt. 1 at 14, \nยถยถ 44-46.  Nor has she offered an explanation in this litigation.  For a \nโhearing mandated by the Due Process Clause [] to serve any useful \npurpose, there must be some factual dispute,โ and โthe absence ofโ \nmaterially disputed facts โis fatal to [plaintiffโs] claim under the Due \nProcess Clause that [she] should have been given a hearing.โ  Codd v. \n19 \n\n \nVelger, 429 U.S. 624, 627 (1977).2 \nII.   The Remaining Factors Favor A Stay \nThe equitable factors weigh decisively in the governmentโs favor, and \nโthe public interest and balance of equities factors mergeโ where, as here, \nโthe government is the partyโ against whom an injunction is sought.  \nMediNatura, Inc. v. FDA, 998 F.3d 931, 945 (D.C. Cir. 2021).  The Supreme \nCourt has emphasized that โthe Government faces greater risk of harm \nfrom an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the \nexecutive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable \nto perform her statutory duty.โ  Boyle, 145 S. Ct. at 2654 (quoting Wilcox, \n145 S. Ct. at 1415).  The Supreme Courtโs orders are binding precedent on \nhow to apply the stay factors, id., and this Court has confirmed that \nโ[i]njunctions that require the President to work with removed principal \nofficers interfere with his constitutional power to supervise the Executive \nBranchโ and โinflic[t] irreparable injury.โ  Order, LeBlanc v. U.S. Privacy \n \n2 Although the Court has no need to reach the issue here for all of the \nreasons explained above, the Court also lacks the equitable power to order \nreinstatement of a principal officer of the United States. See In re Sawyer, \n124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888); White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898).  The \ngovernment acknowledges that this Court has previously declined to grant \nrelief based on that argument but preserves it for further review. See Harris \nv. Bessent, 2025 WL 1021435, at *2 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 7, 2025) (en banc). \n \n20 \n\n \nand Civil Liberties Oversight Board, No. 25-5197 (D.C. Cir. July 1, 2025) \n(granting stay pending appeal). \nThe district court mistakenly concluded that this equitable calculus \ndid not apply here, because โWilcoxโs theory of harm was premisedโ on \nโhaving a reinstated officer exercise the โexecutive power,โ and that Wilcox \nโexpressly disclaimed that its analysisโ would include โthe Federal \nReserve.โ  Op. 46.  The district court was wrong on both counts.  Federal \nReserve Governors obviously exercise executive power when they \npromulgate rules that bind the regulated public, Corner Post, Inc. v. Board \nof Governors of Federal Reserve System, 603 U.S. 799, 805-06 (2024), and \nwhen they bring enforcement actions against regulated entities, Board of \nGovernors of Federal Reserve System v. MCorp Financial, Inc., 502 U.S. \n32, 34-36 (1991).  Under โour constitutional structureโ the Governorsโ \nrulemakings and adjudications โmust be exercises of[] the โexecutive \nPower,โโ which the President must constitutionally oversee.  City of \nArlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304 n.4 (2013).  And while Wilcox noted \nthat its analysis did not โnecessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-\ncause removal protectionsโ for the Federal Reserveโbased on its โdistinct \nhistorical traditionโ drawing on the โFirst and Second Banks of the United \nStates,โ 145 S. Ct. at 1415โthe President and the government are still \n21 \n\n \nunquestionably harmed when a removed officer is reinstated and continues \nto serve notwithstanding the Presidentโs removal.  \nEven setting these cases aside, Cook has identified no irreparable \nharm that would tip the balance in her favor.  This Court has set โa high \nstandard for irreparable injury,โ and a plaintiff must show โthat there is a \nโclear and presentโ need for equitable relief,โโ and โthe injury must be \nbeyond remediation.โ  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 \nF.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  In the removal context, these requirements \nwill be met only in a โgenuinely extraordinary situation.โ  Sampson v. \nMurray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 (1974). \nThe district court concluded that Cook had demonstrated irreparable \nharm in the form of deprivation of her โhigh-ranking, public-servant role.โ  \nOp. 44.  But this Court has rejected the โstatutory right to functionโ theory \nof irreparable injury.  See Dellinger v. Bessent, 2025 WL 887518, at *4 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2025).  Dellinger held that even if the discharged Special \nCounselโs โremoval [wa]s ultra vires,โ a deprivation of his โstatutory right to \nfunction in officeโ was not irreparable.  Id.  โAt worst,โ the removed officer \nโwould remain out of office for a short period of time,โ which was clearly \noutweighed by โthe potential injury to the governmentโ of an injunction \nreinstating the Special Counsel.  Id.  Dellinger did not break new ground; \n22 \n\n \nthe longstanding rule is that, absent a โgenuinely extraordinary situation,โ \nloss of employment does not constitute irreparable harm.  Sampson, 415 \nU.S. at 92 n.68.  โCases are legion holding that loss of employment does not \nconstitute irreparable injury.โ  English v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 334 \n(D.D.C. 2018).   \nIndeed, although the district court relied on a string cite of cases for \nthe proposition that an official deprived of their โstatutory right to \nfunctionโ has demonstrated irreparable harm, see Op. 40, many of those \ndecisions were stayed by this Court or the Supreme Court (Dellinger, \nGrundmann, LeBlanc, Harris, and Harper).  Whatever the district courtโs \nview of plaintiffโs duties or her alleged harm, they do not support the denial \nof a stay.  \nFinally, the district court concluded that the โpublic interest in \nFederal Reserve independence weighs in favor of Cookโs reinstatement.โ \nOp. 47.  Even with the Federal Reserveโs unique structure and history, its \nGovernors are subject to removal for cause, and the Presidentโs actions to \nremove Cook based on her misconduct should strengthen, not diminish, the \nFederal Reserveโs integrity.  As in Wilcox, the balance of equities counsels \nagainst โthe disruptive effect of the repeated removal and reinstatement of \nofficers during the pendency of this litigation.โ  145 S. Ct. at 1415.  \n23 \n\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant an immediate administrative stay and issue a \nstay pending appeal.  We respectfully request that the Court act on either \nrequest by Monday, September 15, 2025.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n  BRETT A. SHUMATE \n   Assistant Attorney General \nYAAKOV M.

COOK, in her official capacity as a   \nmember of the Board of Governors of the Federal   \nReserve System and her personal capacity,   \n   \nPlaintiff,  Case No. 25-cv-2903 (JMC) \n   \nv.   \n   \nDONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as \nPresident of the United States, et al.,  \n   \nDefendants. \n  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThe Federal Reserve Act provides that the President may only remove a member of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System โfor cause.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. This case \ninvolves the first purported โfor causeโ removal of a Board Governor in the Federal Reserveโs \n111-year history. Plaintiff Lisa D. Cook brought this action against Defendant Donald J. Trump, \nin his official capacity as President of the United States, challenging the Presidentโs decision to \nremove her โfor causeโ from the Board of Governors. ECF 1. Cook also sues Jerome H. Powell, \nin his official capacity as Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Id. In \naddition, she sues the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a whole and each \nmember in their official capacity. Id.  \nBefore the Court is Cookโs motion for a temporary restraining order preventing Defendants \nfrom removing her from her position as a member of the Board. ECF 2. President Trumpโs actions \nand Cookโs resulting legal challenge raise many serious questions of first impression that the Court \nbelieves  will  benefit  from  further  briefing  on  a  non-emergency  timeline.  However,  at  this \npreliminary stage, the Court finds that Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 2 of 49\nwas done in violation of the Federal Reserve Actโs โfor causeโ provision. The best reading of the \nโfor causeโ provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the Board of Governors are \nlimited to grounds concerning a Governorโs behavior in office and whether they have been \nfaithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties. โFor causeโ thus does not contemplate \nremoving an individual purely for conduct that occurred before they began in office. In addition, \nthe Court finds that the removal also likely violated Cookโs procedural rights under the Fifth \nAmendmentโs Due Process Clause. She has also demonstrated irreparable harm from her removal. \nFinally, the public interest and the balance of the equities also favor Cook. Because the standard \nfor a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction are the same, and because the Court \nhas held an adversarial hearing on the motion and received additional briefing from the Parties, \nthe Court will construe Plaintiffโs motion for a temporary restraining order as a motion for a \npreliminary injunction, and GRANT the requested injunction.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Framework \nThe Federal Reserve System was established over a century ago by Congress in the Federal \nReserve Act. See 12 U.S.C. ยง 221 et seq. โThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-\nprivate entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the \nUnited States.โ Trump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (2025). This system involves a โcomplex \nset of relationshipsโ between the Board of Governors, the Federal Open Market Committee \n(FOMC), and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks. United States ex rel. Kraus v. Wells \nFargo & Co., 943 F.3d 588, 592 (2d Cir. 2019); see also 12 U.S.C. ยงยง 222, 225a. \n  The Board of Governors is tasked with, among other duties, โpromot[ing] effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.โ 12 U.S.C. \nยง 225a. The Board โconducts monetary policy, regulates banking institutions, and maintains the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 3 of 49\nstability of the nationโs financial system.โ Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of Fed. Rsrv. Emp. \nBenefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citing 12 U.S.C. ยง 248). Sound monetary policy \noften involves making short-term sacrifices for the long-term good of the economy. Congress \ntherefore designed the Federal Reserve and the Board of Governors to possess characteristics that \nreflect their insulation from other parts of the federal government, in particular with respect to the \nBoardโs monetary policy decisions. The Board is funded outside of the annual appropriations \nprocess, through bank assessments. 12 U.S.C. ยงยง 243, 244; see Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. \nProt. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 207 (2020). Its decisions and deliberations on monetary policy matters \nare exempt from Government Accountability Office audits and its rules regarding monetary policy \nare exempt from the Congressional Review Act. 12 U.S.C. ยง 3910(a)(3); 5 U.S.C. ยง 807. In \naddition, the Board is allowed to present legislative recommendations and testimony to Congress \nwithout approval of any โofficer or agency of the United States.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 250. Finally, the \nBoard has independent litigating authority. Id. ยง 248(p).  \nAs for the seven members of the Board of Governors, each is โappointed by the President, \nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 241. Board members are appointed \nto staggered fourteen-year terms, which, notwithstanding unexpected vacancies, typically prevents \nany single administration from appointing a majority of the Boardโs members and further shields \nthe Board from partisan influences. Id. ยง 242. And the Board members, also known as Governors, \nenjoy a limitation on the Presidentโs ability to remove them: โ[E]ach member shall hold office for \na term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed \nfor cause by the President.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 (emphasis added). The statute does not define the \nterm โfor cause.โ Id. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 4 of 49\n Governors  also  serve  on  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee,  along  with  five \nrepresentatives of the Federal Reserve Banks. 12 U.S.C. ยง 263(a).

Within thirty minutes, \nPresident Trump posted on the social media platform Truth Social that โCook must resign, \nnow!!!,โ and shared a link to a news article regarding the allegations. ECF 1 ยถ 44. \n  The letter (as excerpted in Pulteโs social media post) accused Cook of โfalsifying residence \nstatuses for an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based residence and an Atlanta, Georgia-based property in \norder to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.โ ECF 1-2 at 2. \nAccording to Pulte, on June 18, 2021, Cook had taken out a loan on a property in Michigan. Id. at \n2. The terms of the mortgage agreement stated that Cook would use the property as her โprincipal \nresidenceโ for at least one year after the date of occupancy. Id. at 2โ3. However, two weeks later, \nCook purchased a condominium in Atlanta, and in the mortgage agreement, affirmed that this \nproperty would serve as her โprimary residenceโ for a full year. Id. at 3.  \n  Two days after Director Pulte posted the referral letter, President Trump said in an \ninterview that โwhat [Cook] did was badโ and that he would โfire her if she doesnโt resign.โ ECF 1 \nยถ 45. Then, on August 25, 2025, President Trump posted screenshots of a two-page letter to his \nTruth Social account. ECF 1-3 at 2. Cook alleges that she was provided no advance notice of the \nletter before it was posted. ECF 1 ยถ 47. The letter, dated August 25 and addressed to Cook, \nprovided:  \nPursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution of the United States \nand the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, you are hereby removed from \nyour  position  on  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve,  effective \nimmediately.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 6 of 49\nThe Federal Reserve Act provides that you may be removed, at my discretion, for \ncause. See 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. I have determined that there is sufficient cause to \nremove you from your position.  \n \nECF 1-3 at 2. For support, the letter cited to Director Pulteโs August 15 criminal referral.1 Id. \nPresident Trump stated that โthere is sufficient reason to believe you may have made false \nstatements on one or more mortgage agreements.โ Id. Citing to the referral, the President said that \nCook โsigned one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be [her] primary residence \nfor the next year,โ and โ[t]wo weeks later . . . signed another document for a property in Georgia \nstating that it would be [her] primary residence for the next year.โ Id. President Trump claimed \nthat it was โinconceivable that [Cook was] not aware of [her] first commitment when making the \nsecond,โ and it was โimpossible that [she] intended to honor both.โ Id. The President then \nacknowledged the Federal Reserveโs โtremendous responsibility for setting interest rates and \nregulating reserve and member banks.โ Id. He continued:  \nThe American people must be able to have full confidence in the honesty of the \nmembers entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve. In light \nof your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot \nand I do not have such confidence in your integrity. At a minimum, the conduct at \nissue exhibits the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into \nquestion your competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.  \n \nId. The President concluded by stating that โI have determined that faithfully executing the law \nrequires your immediate removal from office.โ Id.  \n  Cook filed a six-count complaint on August 28, 2025. See ECF 1. Count One alleges that \nthe President violated the Federal Reserve Act because his justification for removing her did not \nqualify as โcauseโ under the statute. Id. ยถยถ 61โ66. Count Two alleges that under the Federal \nReserve Act, Cook was entitled to notice and a hearing before her removal. Id. ยถยถ 67โ71. Count \n \n1 The removal letterโs text states that the criminal referral was โattached to this letter,โ but the referral letter was not \nitself shared as part of President Trumpโs social media post.

Id.  ยถยถ 72โ78.  Count  Four  seeks  a  declaratory  judgment  that \nDefendants lack the authority to remove her without complying with applicable statutes and \nregulations. Id. ยถยถ 79โ81. Count Five, brought only against Chair Powell and the Board of \nGovernors, seeks a writ of mandamus commanding these Defendants not to effectuate President \nTrumpโs purported termination. Id. ยถยถ 82โ83. Count Six also seeks equitable relief against Powell \nand the Board to prevent and restrain ongoing violations of statutory and constitutional law. Id. \nยถยถ 84โ86.  \nAfter receiving Cookโs motion for a temporary restraining order, also on August 28, 2025, \nthe Court set a motion hearing for the next morning. See Notice of Hrโg (Aug. 29, 2025). Shortly \nbefore the hearing, Defendant Donald Trump filed his response to the motion. ECF 13. Defendants \nPowell and the Board of Governors filed a notice stating that they would not be offering arguments \nconcerning Cookโs motion. ECF 12. At the hearing, counsel for Cook indicated that they intended \nto file a reply before the Court ruled, which they did on September 2, 2025. ECF 17. The Court \nthen allowed counsel for President Trump to file an additional response, which they did on \nSeptember 4, 2025. ECF 23. Finally, Cook requested leave to file an additional reply, ECF 24, \nwhich the Court granted in a separate order.  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nโA temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy, one that should be granted only \nwhen the moving party, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.โ Sibley v. Obama, \n810 F. Supp. 2d 309, 310 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997)). \nThe Court considers the same factors in ruling on a motion for a temporary restraining order and \na motion for a preliminary injunction. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. FTC, 844 F. Supp. 2d 98, 101 \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 8 of 49\n(D.D.C. 2012). To prevail on either motion, the movant โmust show (1) a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were not granted, \n(3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) that the public \ninterest would be furthered by the injunction.โ Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, \n454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006). In a case like this one, where the Government is the non-\nmovant, the third and fourth factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nAt this preliminary juncture, Cook has demonstrated that each of the factors weighs in \nfavor of preliminary injunctive relief on at least some of her claims.2  \nA.  Cook Is Substantially Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nThe Court finds Cook substantially likely to succeed on at least two of her claims. First, \nthe Court finds Cook likely to succeed on her argument that President Trump violated the Federal \nReserve  Act  because  her  purported  removal  did  not  comply  with  the  statuteโs  โfor  causeโ \nrequirement. Second, the Court finds Cook likely to succeed on her claim that the purported \nremoval deprived her of procedural rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.3  \n1.  President Trumpโs Stated Cause for Firing Cook Likely Does Not Satisfy the โFor \nCauseโ Requirement in the Federal Reserve Act. \n \nThe key question in this dispute is the meaning of the term โfor causeโ in the Federal \nReserve Act. 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. The history of the repeated litigation over the constitutional validity \nof similar removal restrictions is too extensive to recount here. See, e.g., Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n \n2 As discussed below, the Court construes Cookโs motion for a temporary restraining order as a motion for a \npreliminary injunction. See infra section III.D. Again, the legal standard is the same. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., \n844 F. Supp. 2d at 101.  \n \n3 Cook also argues that her purported removal violated procedural protections that she was entitled to as a statutory \nmatter under the Federal Reserve Act. ECF 2-1 at 21; ECF 17 at 20โ22. Because the Court finds Cook likely to succeed \non the merits of her other claims, and that those claims support injunctive relief, it declines to reach Cookโs statutory \nprocess arguments now.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 9 of 49\n220, 250 (2021); Seila L. LLC, 591 U.S. at 197. But in this case, the Government does not contest \nthe constitutionality of the โfor causeโ removal restriction for Board Governors. Instead, it argues \nthat President Trump provided a legal cause under the Federal Reserve Act to remove Cook, and \nthat his decision to do so is not subject to judicial review. ECF 13 at 2. The Court disagrees on \nboth points. Cook has shown that President Trumpโs allegations likely do not qualify as cause \njustifying her removal under the Federal Reserve Act and that the Court can resolve the Partiesโ \ndispute about the interpretation of this statute.  \na.  The Meaning of โFor Causeโ in the Federal Reserve Act  \n \nThe Federal Reserve Act does not define the term โfor cause.โ Generally, when a statutory \nterm is undefined, courts look first to what โthat termโs โordinary, contemporary, common \nmeaningโ was when Congress enactedโ the statute. Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, \n588 U.S. 427, 434 (2019) (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)). Additionally, \nโthe words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall \nstatutory scheme.โ Jazz Pharms., Inc. v. Kennedy, 141 F.4th 254, 261 (D.C. Cir. 2025) (citing Util. \nAir Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 320 (2014)). โStatutory history is an important part of this \ncontext.โ Id. Applying these tools, the Court concludes that the permissible grounds for โfor causeโ \nremoval in the Federal Reserve Act are limited to grounds concerning an officialโs behavior in \noffice and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing statutory duties. The โfor \ncauseโ standard thus does not contemplate removing an individual purely for conduct that occurred \nbefore they assumed the position.  \ni.  Statutory Text and Contemporary Definitions \nThe Government first urges the Court to look to dictionary definitions of the word โcauseโ \nat the time the Federal Reserve Act was first passed in 1913. It claims that โcauseโ was understood \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 10 of 49\nto simply mean a โmotive or reason,โ or โground of action,โ see ECF 13 at 11โ12 (citing Whartonโs \nLaw-Lexicon 150 (11th ed. 1911) and Blackโs Law Dictionary 178 (2d ed. 1910)), and as a result, \nโcauseโ โcover[s] any articulable justification that the President deems sufficient to warrant \nremoval,โ with the exception that, cause cannot extend to โmere policy disagreement,โ id. Cook \nargues that โfor causeโ is a legal term of art and its meaning is not resolved simply by looking to \ndictionary definitions. ECF 17 at 14.  \nWhen identifying the common meaning of the text when Congress enacted the removal \nprovision, the Court looks to the definition as understood in 1935, rather than 1913. The โfor \ncauseโ removal provision of the Federal Reserve Act was first enacted in 1913. See Pub. L. No. \n63-43, 38 Stat. 251, 260 (1913). The โfor causeโ requirement appears, however, to have been \nremoved in the 1933 Banking Act, which amended 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 to provide merely that โeach \nappointive member shall hold office for a term of twelve years from the expiration of the term of \nhis predecessor.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 (1933 supp.); Pub. L. No. 73-66, ยง 6, 48 Stat. 162, 166โ67 \n(1933). The present โfor causeโ provision was then returned to the statute following the passage \nof the 1935 Banking Act, which reorganized the leadership structure of the Federal Reserve. Pub. \nL. No. 74-305, ยง 203, 49 Stat. 684, 704โ05 (1935); see also Gary Richardson & David W. Wilcox, \nHow Congress Designed the Federal Reserve to be Independent of Presidential Control, 39 J. of \nEcon. Perspectives 221, 229 (2025).  \nAt the time of the 1935 amendment, it is true that legal dictionaries defined the word \nโcauseโ as the โorigin or foundation of a thing,โ or a โground of action,โ consistent with the \nGovernmentโs definition. Blackโs Law Dictionary 292 (3d ed. 1933). But they also support the \nnotion  that  โfor  causeโ  was  itself  a  separate  term  that  carried  meaning  independent  of  its \ncomponent parts. The 1933 edition of Blackโs Law Dictionary contains a separate entry for โfor \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 11 of 49\ncauseโ: โWith reference to the power of removal from office, this term means some cause other \nthan the will or pleasure of the removing authority, that is, some cause relating to the conduct, \nability, fitness, or competence of the officer.โ Id. at 796 (emphasis added).  \nPerhaps recognizing that โfor causeโ has to mean more than just any stated reason, at the \nhearing on this motion, counsel for the Government suggested a new definition of โfor causeโ as \nany reason the President can think of so long as that reason (1) is something other than mere policy \ndisagreement, (2) bears on the individualโs ability or fitness to do the job, and (3) was not known \nat the time of the officialโs confirmation. Hrโg Tr. at 66:13โ16 (Aug. 29, 2025). That position is in \nobvious tension with the Governmentโs preferred dictionary-definition approach to โcauseโ in its \ninitial briefing, and the Governmentโs supplemental briefing does not resolve the discrepancy. See \nECF 13 at 9; ECF 23. Thus, even the Government admits that the definition of โfor causeโ in this \ncontext cannot extend to any articulable reason the President deems to warrant removal and must \nhave some limitations. More than dictionary definitions are required to resolve this dispute.  \nii.  Legislative Context \nThe Presidentโs ability to remove a member of the Board of Governors must also be \nunderstood within the โoverall statutory schemeโ governing the Federal Reserve, see West Virginia \nv. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022), which contemplates a degree of insulation from presidential \npressure, particularly with respect to its monetary policymaking decisions. As the Supreme Court \nhas observed when distinguishing the Federal Reserve from other agencies, the Federal Reserve is \na โuniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the \nFirst and Second Banks of the United States,โ Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415, one for which Congress \nhas provided significant independence and insulation. See Richardson & Wilcox at 223โ30 \n(reviewing the legislative history of the Banking Act of 1935 and concluding that the bill reflected \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 12 of 49\nan intent that โmonetary policy was independent of the presidentโ); Banking Act of 1935: Hearings \non S.1715 and H.R. 7617 Before the S. Comm. On Banking & Currency (โSenate Banking Act \nHearingsโ), 74th Cong. 408 (1935). The Federal Reserveโs structure, and in particular, the for \ncause protection, reflects Congressโs decision that โa degree of independence was needed to \nโincrease the ability of the banking system to promote stability.โโ PHH Corp. v. Consumer Fin. \nProt. Bureau, 881 F.3d 75, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 74-742, at 1 (1935)), \nabrogated on other grounds by Seila L. LLC, 591 U.S. 197. โBy insulating the Board from \npresidential control and political pressures, Congress sought to ensure that the Federal Reserve \nwould โreflect, not the opinion of a majority of special interests, but rather the well considered \njudgment of a body that takes into consideration all phases of national economic life.โโ Id. (quoting \nH.R. Rep. No. 74-742, at 6). \nThe historical context in which Congress enacted the Banking Act of 1935 demonstrates \nan awareness of the importance of such protections. The Banking Act of 1935 was passed shortly \nfollowing the Supreme Courtโs decision in Humphreyโs Executor v. United States. Humphreyโs \nExecutor established that a โfor causeโ protection for members of the Federal Trade Commission \n(FTC), limiting removal to โinefficiency, neglect of duty, and malfeasance in office,โ did not \nviolate the Constitution. 295 U.S. 602, 629 (1935). The Court in Humphreyโs Executor noted that \nthe Presidentโs power to remove was a โcoercive influence,โ which naturally โthreatens the \nindependence of a commission.โ Id. at 630. Even the Government agrees on this point, when it \nconcedes that a โpolicy disagreementโ with a Federal Reserve Governor cannot qualify as a โfor \ncauseโ removal ground. ECF 13 at 18 (citing Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958)); \nsee also Hrโg Tr. at 55:24โ56:2.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 13 of 49\nAt the hearings on the Banking Act, members of Congress and the witnesses took note of \nthe Humphreyโs Executor case and its implications for the Federal Reserveโs independence. Senate \nBanking Act Hearings at 396โ97 (witness arguing that the Federal Reserveโs โindependence from \npolitical control must be assured,โ and that passage of the bill should be postponed until the \nHumphreyโs Executor decision clarified the issue of removal protections); id. 754โ56 (witness \nnoting the pendency of Humphreyโs Executor and arguing that โno member of the Board shall be \nremovable from office during the term for which he was appointedโ). And the final bill reflects \nthat what was true for the FTC in Humphreyโs Executor is true for the Federal Reserve: โ[T]he \nlanguage of the act, the legislative reports, and the general purposes of the legislation as reflected \nby the debates,โ all demonstrate โthe congressional intent to create a body of experts who shall \ngain experience by length of service; a body which shall be independent of executive authority, \nexcept in its selection, and free to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other \nofficial or any department of the government.โ Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 625โ26. The Federal \nReserve Actโs โfor causeโ restriction on the removal of Board Governors is a key part of the \nstatutory scheme protecting the Board of Governors from the naturally โcoercive influenceโ of the \npower of presidential removal which โthreatens [its] independence.โ Id. at 630. This statutory \nscheme points in favor of a narrower, rather than broader, understanding of โfor cause.โ  \niii.  Relationship to Prior Removal Statutes \nโIt is a commonplace of statutory interpretation that โCongress legislates against the \nbackdrop of existing law.โโ Parker Drilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 611 \n(2019) (quoting McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 398 n.3 (2013)). Accordingly, the Court \nfinds highly persuasive Cookโs argument that the Federal Reserve Actโs use of โfor causeโ should \nalso be read in light of prior statutory removal provisions for Presidentially appointed, Senate-\n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 14 of 49\nconfirmed roles. Those provisions consistently limited the grounds for presidential removal of \nagency heads or members to some combination of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \n(referred to in shorthand as INM), which meant โcases where officials act wrongfully in officeโ \n(malfeasance), โfail to perform their statutory dutiesโ (neglect of duty), โor perform them in such \nan inexpert or wasteful manner that they impair the public welfareโ (inefficiency). Jane Manners \n& Lev Menand, The Three Permissions: Presidential Removal and the Statutory Limits of Agency \nIndependence, 121 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 8 (2021). \nIn 1935, federal statutes imposing restrictions on the Presidentโs ability to remove board \nand agency members had two essential flavors: They either provided that the official could be \nremoved โfor cause,โ with no further elaboration as to the meaning of that term, or they provided \nthat the official could be removed for some combination of INM, with that formula first being used \nfor the removal protections for the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. See Manners & \nMenand app. b. at 74โ75 (identifying three federal officer removal statutes before August 1935 \nthat used โfor cause,โ and eleven that used some combination of INM); ch. 104, ยง 11, 24 Stat. 383 \n(1887). With minor exceptions, the only enumerated removal bases appear to be the INM bases.4 \nStatutes did not use โfor causeโ and INM in the same removal provision. See Manners & Menand \napp. b. at 74โ75. As for the statutes that enumerated either inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance in \noffice as a basis for removal, not all used all three grounds. See id.; see, e.g., Pub. L. No. 67-347, \n \n4 There appear to be two minor exceptions. A statute creating a โBoard of Mediationโ for disputes between employers \nand employees of common carriers provided that the Commissioner could be removed for โmisconduct in office.โ See \nPub. L. No. 63-6, ยง 11, 38 Stat. 103, 108 (1913). The Board of Mediation was later replaced by the National Mediation \nBoard, whose members could only be removed for โinefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or \nineligibility.โ Pub. L. No. 73-442, ยง 4, 48 Stat. 1193, 1193โ94 (1934) (emphasis added). While the Court cannot be \npositive at this preliminary stage that it has reviewed every relevant removal provision in the U.S. Code, a review of \nthe statutes cited in Manners and Menandโs article supports Cookโs claim that โby 1935, the only statutorily \nenumerated grounds for presidential removal of executive officers were INM.โ ECF 17 at 12 (emphasis in original). \nMoreover, the Government has not disputed this characterization of the U.S. Code at the time.  \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 15 of 49\nยง 1, 42 Stat. 1023 (1922) (providing that members of the United States Coal Commission were to \nbe appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and could โbe removed \nby the President for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but for no other causeโ).  \nSo,  the  overwhelming  backdrop  of  enumerated  federal  removal  restrictions  for \nPresidentially appointed, tenure-protected roles at either the time of the 1913 Federal Reserve Act \nor the 1935 Banking Act was composed of the INM grounds. Neither the Supreme Court nor lower \ncourts have provided a definitive interpretation of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \noffice, either jointly or separately, in the context of federal removal protections for independent \nagency members. See Manners & Menand at 4. But recent scholarship shows that before entering \nthe federal lexicon, these terms carried with them historical meanings particular to the context of \npublic administration and officer removal. See id. at 6 (โWhen Congress first used the now-\ntalismanic INM phrase in 1887, it defined these circumstances using terms that were already well-\nknown.โ). As is relevant here, each of the INM grounds referred to the officerโs performance of \ntheir statutory duties or their conduct in office. The ground of inefficiency, a term first used \nextensively in state civil service reform bills in the late nineteenth century, was โassociated not \nonly  with  incompetence  but  with  the  wasteful  expenditure  of  government  resources,โ  and \ninefficient officers โlacked the skills to perform their duties, rendering them incapable of doing \ntheir jobs.โ Id. at 6, 45; see also id. at 45โ52.5 Neglect of duty has a multi-century history as a term \nmeaning the failure โto perform oneโs duties in a way that caused specific harm toโ the entity to \n \n5 Inefficiency was โadded to the removal lexicon only in the middle of the nineteenth century, when legislators used \nthe term to describe wasteful government administration caused by inept officers.โ Manners & Menand at 28. Manners \nand Menand identify inefficiency first being used as a removal ground for tenure-protected officers in Indiana state \ncode provisions from 1843. Id. at 47 n.269, 48 n.277 (citing 1843 Ind. Rev. Stat., ch. 4, ยงยง 37, 47). The term was \nsubsequently used in state law and in a โseries of civil service reform bills,โ before it was included as a removal ground \nin the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887. Id. at 52.  \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 16 of 49\nwhich the officer owed the duties. Id. at 29.6 โMalfeasance in officeโ also had an extensive history \nin the common law, colonial practice, and American state law, and referred to a โwrongful act \ncommitted in the execution of oneโs duties that caused injuries to others.โ7 Id. at 6 (emphasis \nadded). While each of these terms addresses different conduct, what ties them together is a concern \nwith an officialโs in-office conduct or performance: they all relate to whether an official is faithfully \nand effectively executing their statutory duties. \niv.  โFor Causeโ in the Federal Reserve Act Refers to In-Office Conduct \nthat Demonstrates Ineffective or Unfaithful Execution of Statutory \nDuties. \n \nBased on the statutory context above, the Court finds that the โfor causeโ provision in the \nFederal Reserve Act extends only to concerns about the Board memberโs ability to effectively and \nfaithfully execute their statutory duties, in light of circumstances that have occurred while they are \nin office. The historical background shows that when creating various agencies, departments, and \nboards during the period leading up to the passage of the Banking Act of 1935 and enumerating \nthe grounds for removal from those bodies, Congress was narrowly focused on the INM grounds. \nUnder the doctrine of in pari materia, statutes โrelate[d] to the same subject or objectโ are \nโconstrued together.โ Common Cause v. Fed. Election Commโn, 842 F.2d 436, 441โ42 (D.C. Cir. \n1988); Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 244 (1972) (โ[The rule] necessarily assumes \n \n6 โNeglectโ had been a ground for removing the โofficers of English towns and boroughs for hundreds of years,โ and \nconstituted a type of โmisdemeanor,โ or โbad behavior,โ that could trigger the removal of life-tenured officers. Id. at \n6. โNeglect of dutyโ was also a historical common-law basis for the removal of โgood behaviorโ roles like judges and \nclerks. Id. at 28โ29. Manners and Menand also identify state statutes beginning in the early 1800s that either penalize \nofficials for neglect of duty or make them removable on that ground. Id. at 43โ44.  \n \n7 Malfeasance was featured in the context of common-law municipal officer and public official removal, both in \nEngland and the United States. Id. at 28โ29. Like โneglect of duty,โ it was considered a misdemeanor that could trigger \nan officerโs removal. Id. at 6. Under American state law in the 1800s, it was a ground to find that an officer had failed \nto engage in the โfaithful performanceโ of the duties of his office. See id. at 41 n.224 (citing Harris v. Hanson, 11 Me. \n241, 245 (1834)).  \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 17 of 49\nthat whenever Congress passes a new statute, it acts aware of all previous statutes on the same \nsubject.โ). That rule is instructive here. The fact that Congress was narrowly focused on the \nofficerโs on-the-job performance in contemporary officer removal statutes supports the conclusion \nthat Congress did not mean โfor causeโ removal to extend to conduct of a significantly different \nkind.  \nCook argues that this Court should find that โfor causeโ in the Federal Reserve Act is \nsynonymous with and limited to the prevailing INM standard. ECF 17 at 10. Contemporary usage \nat the time of the passage of the Banking Act of 1935 indicates that the three terms were indeed \noften treated synonymously with โfor cause.โ See Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 171โ72 \n(1926) (describing a statute that provided for โremoval for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office,โ as one containing provisions for โremoval for causeโ (emphasis added)). \nThis might explain why โfor causeโ and INM were not used in the same statute. If โfor causeโ was \na synonym for INM, using the terms together would have been superfluous. \nA traditional presumption of statutory interpretation, however, is that when Congress \nโemploys different words, it usually means different things.โ Ortiz v. Secโy of Def., 41 F.3d 738, \n740 (D.C. Cir. 1994). So Cook is likely not correct that โfor causeโ and the INM standard are \nperfectly synonymous. But that statutory interpretation principle also dooms the Governmentโs \ninitial argument that โfor causeโ means โany articulable justification that the President deems \nsufficient to warrant removal.โ ECF 13 at 12. Congress knew how to state a lesser requirement, \nand did so in a different section of the Banking Act of 1935, which provided that the Comptroller \nof the Currency, a Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed official, would hold office for \nโfive years unless sooner removed by the President, upon reasons to be communicated by him to \nthe Senate.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 2 (emphasis added); Pub. L. No. 74-305, ยง 209, 49 Stat. 703, 707 (1935). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 18 of 49\nThus, as the Government has already conceded, โfor causeโ must mean something more than any \nโreason[]โ the President could communicate. 12 U.S.C. ยง 2. \nThat โfor causeโ means something broader than INM finds some support in the Supreme \nCourtโs analysis in Collins v. Yellen, which reviewed the constitutionality of the removal protection \nfor the Director of the FHFA, which, as here, provided for removal โfor cause.โ 594 U.S. at 255. \nThere, the Court did not purport to definitively interpret the meaning of โfor cause,โ although it \nnoted that the language โappear[ed] to give the President more removal authority than other \nremoval provisions,โ such as one for โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.โ Id. \nFurther, the Court was interpreting a โfor causeโ removal provision passed in 2008, not one passed \nin 1935. See 12 U.S.C. ยง 4512. Since 1935, the enumerated justifications for independent agency \nand board member removal have expanded beyond simply INM to consist of grounds such as \nโimmorality, ineligibility, offenses involving moral turpitude, and conviction of a crime.โ See \nManners & Menand at 63 n.363; see, e.g., Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., \n561 U.S. 477 app. A at 549โ56 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (cataloging removal grounds); Monsalvo \nVelazquez v. Bondi, 145 S. Ct. 1232, 1245 n.5 (2025) (โ[D]ifferent statutes passed at different \ntimes against different regulatory backdrops may bear different meanings.โ). And the logic in \nCollins demonstrates why โfor causeโ in one statutory context may not be the same in another. In \nrelying on cases involving the employer-employee relationship, Collins observed that โdisobeying \nan order is generally regarded as โcauseโ for removal.โ 594 U.S. at 256 (citing NLRB v. Loc. Union \nNo. 1229, Intโl Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 346 U.S. 464, 475 (1953)). But here, the President is not \nempowered to direct the Board of Governors in the same manner, or to remove a Governor for \nfailing to follow his directions. The ability to do so would be tantamount to being able to fire for \npolicy disagreement, which the Government has admitted the President cannot do.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 19 of 49\nAnd again, even if โfor causeโ means something more than the traditional INM grounds, \nthe Court is not convinced that it encompasses reasons of a different kind altogether than those \ngrounds. The fact remains that INM grounds were the key causes recognized in similar federal \nstatutes at the time. Defining โfor causeโ in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 as extending to in-office conduct that \nis closely related to the INM grounds would still provide โfor causeโ with some independent \nmeaning separate from INM. The existing landscape of removal statutes indicates that Congress \nwanted officials to be judged on their performance and conduct while holding the role. Insofar as \nthere were any other recognized grounds for removal at the time, those also involved in-office \nconduct. For example, the Commissioner of Mediation and Conciliation could only be removed \nby the President for โmisconduct in office.โ Pub. L. No. 63-6, ยง 11, 38 Stat. 103, 108 (1913) \n(emphasis added); see also Pub. L. No. 73-442, ยง 4, 48 Stat. 1193, 1193โ94 (1934) (providing for \nremoval from the National Mediation Board for either โinefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance \nin office, or ineligibilityโ (emphasis added)). State statutes also contemplated that โmisfeasanceโ \ncould be grounds for punishment or removal from office. Whereas malfeasance is the โdoing [of] \nan act wholly wrongful,โ misfeasance is โ[t]he improper performance of some act which a man \nmay lawfully do.โ See, e.g., Blackโs Law Dictionary 1193 (3d ed. 1933) (distinguishing the two \nterms). While both related to performance in office, they are separate concepts and were treated \nseparately in state removal law. See Manners & Menand at 41 n.226, 43.  \nThe Governmentโs alternative reading that โfor causeโ means โa reason thatโ is (1) โmore \nthan mere policy disagreement,โ (2) โbears on the individualโs ability or fitness to do the job,โ and \n(3) โwas not known at the time of the officialโs confirmation,โ is too broad. Hrโg Tr. at 66:14โ16. \nFirst, the Governmentโs proposed โability or fitnessโ testโparticularly when combined with the \nGovernmentโs  claim  that  the  Presidentโs  decision  is  completely  unreviewableโputs  little \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 20 of 49\nfunctional limitation on the Presidentโs ability to remove a Board Governor. The Governmentโs \nalternative position, one for which it has provided little textual or historical basis, would allow the \nPresident to remove individuals even for arbitrary reasons provided that the President viewed the \nreasons as relevant to the individualโs ability or fitness to do the job. Moreover, it would incentivize \nthe President and subordinates to dig up prior conduct, however insubstantial, to justify removal \nfrom the Board, even where the Board member has been up to that point performing their statutory \nduties impeccably. Second, the Governmentโs concession that conduct that was known to the \nappointing authorities (the President and Senate) at the time of a Board memberโs appointment \ncould not be the basis for a later โfor causeโ firing is at odds with the Governmentโs theory that \nthe conduct that a President may take into account when making a โfor causeโ determination lacks \nany temporal limitation.  \nA little more about that point. In its opening brief, the Government observes that Cookโs \nreading of the statute as providing for potential removal based only upon a Governorโs conduct in \noffice  โwould  insulate  all  manner  of  gross  wrongdoingโ  and  preclude  the  President  from \nโremov[ing] a Governor who was revealed to have committed massive financial fraudโso long \nas it happened before confirmation.โ ECF 13 at 17. But, as the Court has already mentioned, the \nGovernment has since recognized a likely exception for conductโeven that amounting to โgross \nwrongdoingโโif it was known at the time of confirmation. Hrโg Tr. at 66:13โ16. Why should the \nquestion of whether conduct satisfies the statuteโs โfor causeโ requirement turn on whether the \nconduct  was  known  prior  to  confirmation?  If  past  fraud  provides  a  sufficient  (and  in  the \nGovernmentโs view, obvious) justification for removal under this statute, it is not clear why the \nfact that a prior administration was aware of the conduct would sufficiently address a later \nPresidentโs  concerns  about  a  Governorโs  continued  service,  or  cabin  what  the  Government \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 21 of 49\notherwise suggests is the Presidentโs unfettered discretion to remove officers for almost any \nreason. The Court suspects that the Government acknowledged this limitation because a reading \nof โfor causeโ that would permit the President to second-guess the judgment of his predecessor \nand Congress by removing duly confirmed Governors and replacing them with his own nominees \nwould offend the statutory scheme. Removing Governors from office based on conduct that was \nalready known and ratified through the confirmation process would allow for just that.8  \nThe Governmentโs argument that a rule that does not take into account pre-confirmation \nconduct will lead to a parade of horribles also ignores that this is precisely the line that Congress \nhas drawn in dozens of statutes over the past century. See Manners & Menand app. b. at 74โ75. \nFor the officers that Congress insulated with INM protections, pre-confirmation conduct has never \nbeen a basis for removal. The Court is not breaking new ground in interpreting the Federal Reserve \nActโs โfor causeโ provision consistent with this historical landscape.  \nA conclusion that Congress was not particularly concerned with addressing conduct that \noccurred before the officeholder assumed the position is similarly consistent with the Board of \nGovernorsโ appointment scheme. That scheme involves extensive opportunities for investigation \nand rigorous vetting by both the President who appoints the nominee and the Senate who confirms \nthem. Further, the Courtโs reading of the statute does not mean that a Governorโs prior conduct \ncould never relate to in-office conduct to justify removal. For example, an approach that focuses \non the individualโs in-office conduct and performance would certainly permit โfor causeโ removal \nwhere an officer is convicted of a serious crime and incarcerated while in office, even if that \n \n8 Here the Parties seem to dispute whether information about Cookโs property ownership and mortgage financing were \nโknownโ at the time she was confirmed. See ECF 17 at 17 n.6; ECF 23 at 9. The Court does not have sufficient \ninformation to resolve that dispute. Nor does it quite understand how it would go about determining what may have \nbeen known at the time of Cookโs confirmation, which is another issue with the line the Government has drawn. In \nany event, it is not necessary for the Court to find this fact at this stage. The Court rules solely on the legal questions \nraised in resolving this motion, not questions that potentially involve factual disputes.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 22 of 49\nconviction was the result of earlier conduct. Such a conviction would obviously interfere with the \nability of an officer to effectively and faithfully carry out their in-office duties. Indeed, standing \nalone, a Governorโs subsequent conviction would be a significant event occurring in office, \nregardless of when the conduct giving rise to that conviction occurred.  \nFinally, the Court is satisfied that this understanding of the โfor causeโ protection in \n12 U.S.C. ยง 242 does not unduly infringe on the Presidentโs Article II powers. The Courtโs reading \nof โfor causeโ provides broader grounds for removal than the removal protection blessed by the \nSupreme Court in Humphreyโs Executor, which permitted removal only for the classic INM \nstandard. Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 620. And in Trump v. Wilcox, which raised concerns about \nthe constitutionality of removal provisions narrower than the one in question here, the Supreme \nCourt made clear that its analysis did not extend to the Federal Reserve Boardโs โfor causeโ \nprotection. 145 S. Ct. at 1415; 29 U.S.C. ยง 153(a) (providing that members of the National Labor \nRelations Board may only be removed โfor neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no \nother causeโ); 5 U.S.C. ยง 1202(d) (providing that members of the Merit Systems Protection Board \nmay be removed โonly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in officeโ). Accordingly, \nthe Court finds that permissible cause for removal of a Federal Reserve Governor extends only to \nconcerns about the Board memberโs ability to effectively and faithfully execute their statutory \nduties, in light of events that have occurred while they are in office. \nb.  The Presidentโs Decision is Reviewable to Determine if He Has Stated a \nLegally Permissible Cause.  \n \nThe Government argues that whatever the definition of โfor causeโ in the Federal Reserve \nAct, this Court lacks the ability to review the Presidentโs decision. ECF 13 at 7โ9. According to \nthe Government, the determination of cause is committed to the Presidentโs discretion by statute, \nleaving no role for this Court.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 23 of 49\nThe Court disagrees. It is true that when a statute โentrusts a discrete specific decision to \nthe President and contains no limitations on the Presidentโs exercise of that authority, judicial \nreview of an abuse of discretion claim is not available.โ Mountain States Legal Found. v. Bush, \n306 F.3d 1132, 1136 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, \n1331 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). But โwhere the authorizing statute . . . places discernible limits on the \nPresidentโs discretion,โ review is available, given that the โresponsibility of determining the limits \nof statutory grants of authority . . . is a judicial function entrusted to the courts.โ Id. (quoting Reich, \n74 F.3d at 1327).  \nThe Government acknowledges that there are contexts under which Cookโs challenge \nwould be reviewable. At oral argument, the Government conceded that Cookโs case would be \nreviewable had President Trump provided Cook with no cause whatsoever. Hrโg Tr. 58:13โ16. In \nsuch a case, President Trump, required to remove Cook โfor cause,โ would have clearly exceeded \nhis statutory authority in failing to do so. In the Governmentโs view, however, because the statute \ndoes not clearly define โfor cause,โ the President โnecessarily must make a discretionary judgment \nin exercising th[e] [removal] power,โ and the โsufficiency and adequacy of th[e] reasonโ given is \nnot reviewable. ECF 13 at 11. The Court finds that this is doubly incorrect in the context of this \ncase. First, the Governmentโs argument fails because, as discussed above, the term โfor causeโ as \nused in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242, has definable limits, which include that a member of the Board of \nGovernors may only be removed for in-office conduct demonstrating that they are not effectively \nand faithfully carrying out their statutory duties. Thus, when confronted with a justification offered \nby the President that clearly does not fall within the Presidentโs statutory authority, this Court has \nthe responsibility to review. It is no different than if the President had attempted to fire Cook \nwithout cause or for a reason the Government acknowledges sits outside of the statute. See \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 24 of 49\nMountain States Legal Found., 306 F.3d at 1136. Even when a statute โdelegates discretionary \nauthorityโ to an actor, the โrole of the reviewing court . . . is, as always, to independently interpret \nthe statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits.โ Loper Bright \nEnters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 (2024); Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) \n(โIt is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law isโ). \nSecond, the Government confuses review for the sufficiency and adequacy of a permissible cause \n(such as the strength of evidence showing that an officer has engaged in misconduct while in \noffice), with whether the President has even provided a legally permissible cause in the first place, \nwhich is clearly reviewable.  \nIn  arguing  otherwise,  the  Government  primarily  relies  on  Reagan  v.  United  States, \n182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901), a case brought by a commissioner of the U.S. Court for the Indian \nterritory challenging his removal. In Reagan, the statute provided that the commissioners were to \nโhold office under their existing appointments, subject to removal by the judge of the district where \nsaid commissioners reside, for causes prescribed by law.โ Id. at 424. The commissionersโ terms \nwere not fixed by statute. Id. The Court found that despite the appointment statuteโs reference to \nโcauses prescribed by law,โ no causes for removal had ever been โaffirmatively specified by \nCongress.โ Id. at 425. As a result, the Court stated that โremoval for cause, when causes are not \ndefined nor removal for cause provided for, is a matter of discretion, and not reviewable.โ Id.  \nReagan does not control this case. First, it is unlikely that Reaganโs analysis even applies \nto a Federal Board Governor. Reagan identified term-of-years protection and โcauses of removalโ \nprovisions as two separate types of limitations on the ability of the โappointing power . . . [to] \nremove at pleasure or for such cause as it deemed sufficient.โ Id. at 425. Either, the Court noted, \nwere sufficient to trigger a procedural requirement that the removed officer receive a notice and \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 25 of 49\nhearing before removal. See id. (noting โthe rule . . . that where causes of removal are specified by \nConstitution or statute, as also where the term of office is for a fixed period, notice and hearing \nare essentialโ (emphasis added)). But because the commissioner in Reagan did not โhold their \noffice[] for life or by any fixed tenure,โ they therefore โf[ell] within the settled rule that the power \nof removal is incident to the power of appointment.โ Id. at 424. Here, Cookโs position is for a set \nterm of years and thus not covered by the holding in Reagan. Second, even if Reaganโs analysis \napplied to an officer with a term-of-years protection, the statute in Reagan is substantially different \nfrom the โfor causeโ statute here. The statute in Reagan provided that the President could fire โfor \ncauses prescribed by law,โ but Congress had not prescribed any specific causes, permissible or \nimpermissible. Id. at 425. Here, the Court has determined that โfor causeโ is a circumscribed \ncategory, the bounds of which are judicially policeable. \nSimilarly, the Court does not find that the Supreme Court of the District of Columbiaโs \nopinion in United States ex rel. Garland v. Oliver governs the analysis. There, a statute allowed \nthe President to remove justices of the peace for the District of Columbia โfor cause.โ 6 Mackey \n47, 56 (Sup. Ct. D.C. 1887). While the Court at one point suggested that โwe suppose it would not \nbe, that . . . this court can review [the Presidentโs] action for the purpose of determining the \nsufficiency of the causes which induce him to remove an officer,โ this statement was clearly dicta. \nId. The Court itself acknowledged that the proposition โ[was] not argued,โ in the case, which was \nnot about the sufficiency of the cause but whether the President had the power to remove the officer \nin the first place. Id. at 48, 56. And again, the decision that would have been unreviewable in \nGarland was the โsufficiencyโ of the causes. Here, Cook presents an argument that the cause \npresented was statutorily off-limits.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 26 of 49\nFinally, taken to its logical conclusion, the Governmentโs argument leads to an absurd \nresult: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the \nGovernment claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would \nnevertheless be unreviewable. Hrโg Tr. at 58:17โ59:4. This cannot be the case. Such a rule would \nprovide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the \nPresident could, in practice, โremove a member . . . merely because he wanted his own appointees \non theโ Board of Governors. Wiener, 357 U.S. at 356. Here, there is a disagreement between the \nParties about the interpretation of a federal statute. The Court is exercising its appropriate role in \nresolving this dispute.   \nc.  The Presidentโs Allegations Fail to State a Qualifying Cause Under the \nStatute. \n \nHaving determined that the โfor causeโ protection in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 restricts presidential \nremoval of members of the Board of Governors to situations where the record of the Governorโs \nin-office behavior demonstrates they cannot effectively and faithfully carry out their statutory \nduties, the answer is clear: President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cookโs \nremoval.  \nPresident Trumpโs stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cookโs conduct before \nshe began serving on the Federal Reserve Board.9 As discussed above, such allegations are not a \nlegally permissible cause. The Presidentโs equivocal claim that Cook โmay have made false \nstatements on one or more mortgage agreements,โ ECF 1-3 at 2 (emphasis added), refers only to \nconduct that may have occurred before she was confirmed to her position. It does not address her \nin-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cookโs performance or personal \n \n9 Although the Court decides this issue on the ground that President Trumpโs stated cause falls outside the causes \npermissible under the statute and is not inquiring into the sufficiency of the evidence presented by President Trump, \nthe Court notes that the allegations are ones to which Cook strenuously objects. See ECF 17 at 15.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 27 of 49\nconduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties. \nWhile President Trump states in his letter that he believes that the conduct was โ[a]t a minimumโ \ngrossly negligent and โcalls into question [Cook]โs competence and trustworthiness as a financial \nregulator,โ his letter does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a \nmember of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role. \nId.  \nAgain, this outcome aligns with the understanding of โfor cause,โ in light of its legal \nmeaning at the time when the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 and restructured in 1935. The \nlesson to be drawn from the then-existing history of removal protections is that an independent \nagency official was meant to be judged by their actual performance in their office. Removal was \nnot meant to be based on the Presidentโs assumptions about the officialโs future performance as \nextrapolated from unproven conduct dating from before they assumed the office. To do otherwise \nwould open up the officer and agency to the dangers of โcontrol or coercive influence, direct or \nindirect,โ  that  would  undermine  the  independent  and  expert  judgment  of  the  officer.  See \nHumphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 629.  \nOn this record, Cook has shown that she is likely to prevail on her claim that her removal \nwas not โfor cause,โ and therefore violated the Federal Reserve Act.10    \n2.  Cook is Likely to Prevail on the Merits of Her Constitutional Due Process Claim.  \n \nCook argues that her purported removal violated procedural rights guaranteed to her by the \nFifth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause, which required that Cook receive notice and be provided \n \n10 For the purposes of this motion, the Court bases its holding on the conclusion that President Trump has stated a \nlegally impermissible reason for firing Cook and does not also need to reach Cookโs argument that the Presidentโs \ndecision failed to show โcauseโ under the Federal Reserve Act because the asserted basis for cause was โpretextual.โ \nSee ECF 1 ยถ 60.  \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 28 of 49\nan opportunity to be heard before any โfor causeโ removal occurred. The record currently before \nthe Court demonstrates that Cook did not receive such notice and hearing, and thus has shown a \nprocedural violation.  \na.  Cookโs Constitutional Due Process Rights Were Likely Violated. \nCook argues that she has a constitutionally protected property right in her continued \nposition as a member of the Board of Governors, and as a result was entitled to notice and a hearing \nbefore her termination. ECF 2-1 at 19โ20. The Government contests that Cook has a property \ninterest in her position, and even assuming that she does, argues that Cook received all the process \ndue to her under the Fifth Amendment. ECF 13 at 19โ22. \nThe Fifth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause guarantees that no person shall be โdeprived \nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ U.S. Const. amend. V. In determining \nwhether an individualโs procedural due process rights have been violated, the Court conducts a \ntwo-step inquiry. The Court โfirst determine[s] whether she was deprived of a protected interest,โ \nand if so, โthen determine[s] whether she received the process she was due.โ Esparraguera v. \nDepโt of the Army, 101 F.4th 28, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (citing UDC Chairs Chapter, Am. Assโn of \nUniv. Professors v. Bd. of Trs. of UDC, 56 F.3d 1469, 1471 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  \ni.  Cook Has a Property Interest in Her Fixed-Term, For Cause Protected \nPosition. \n \nโProperty  interests  are  not  created  by  the  Constitution.โ  Cleveland  Bd.  of  Educ.  v. \nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985). โ[T]hey are created and their dimensions are defined by \nexisting rules or understandings that stem from an independent source.โ Id. To establish a protected \ninterest in her position as a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board, Cook argues that this Court \nshould apply the analysis in Loudermill and the cases that follow it. ECF 2-1 at 20โ21. In \nLoudermill, the Supreme Court found that a โpublic employee who can be discharged only for \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 29 of 49\ncauseโ had a constitutionally protected property interest in their continued employment. 470 U.S. \nat 535, 538โ39. In that case, the property interest was created by an Ohio statute that entitled the \nemployees to hold their positions โduring good behavior and efficient service,โ and stated that they \ncould not be dismissed โexcept . . . for . . . misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office.โ \nId. at 538โ39. Subsequent cases in this Circuit have followed the logic of Loudermill and have \nreiterated that the basis of the property interest in a government employeeโs position โturns on the \nextent of any substantive limitations on the governmentโs authority to remove her.โ Esparraguera, \n101 F.4th at 33. As is relevant here, courts have found that โa property interest exists if the \nemployee can โbe removed only for cause.โโ Id. (citing Thompson v. District of Columbia, \n530 F.3d 914, 918 (D.C. Cir. 2008)).  \nThe Federal Reserve Act unquestionably provides that a Board Governor is entitled to serve \nfor a fourteen-year term unless they are removed by the President โfor cause.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. \nThe D.C. Circuit has recognized that an employee removable only โfor causeโ has a property \ninterest in their position because they โcan expect to remain employed unless they do something \nwarranting their termination.โ Esparraguera, 101 F.4th at 33. On its face, the reasoning of \nLoudermill and the cases that follow it would seem to apply neatly to Cookโs situation.  \nThe Government does not contest that the โfor causeโ language in 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 is of \nthe type that has previously provided federal employees expectations of job security and a due \nprocess-protected property interest. See ECF 13 at 19โ22. Even under the Governmentโs preferred \ninterpretation of the phrase, Cook still had an expectation to serve out the remainder of her \nfourteen-year term โunless [she did] something warranting [her] termination,โ i.e., something that \nweighed negatively on her ability or fitness to do her job as a Federal Reserve Governor. \nEsparraguera, 101 F.4th at 33; see also Marshall J. Breger & Gary J. Edles, Established by \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 30 of 49\nPractice: The Theory and Operation of Independent Federal Agencies, 52 Admin. L. Rev. 1111, \n1147 (2000) (endorsing the notion that โ[if] the [agency] member has a statutory right to continued \nemployment, he or she cannot be deprived of the job without due processโ). \nInstead, the Government argues that the Loudermill analysis does not apply to a Board \nGovernor like Cook because she was acting as a โprincipal officer of the United States, not a mere \nโpublic employee.โโ ECF 13 at 20. The Government claims that it is an established rule that as a \nprincipal officer, Cook had no property interest in her office. ECF 13 at 20. \nThe Court is unable to glean such a rule from the authorities that the Government puts \nforward. Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548 (1900), which the Government cites for the proposition \nthat โpublic offices are mere agencies or trusts, and not property as such,โ dealt with elected \nofficesโin that case, the governor and lieutenant governor of the state of Kentucky. Id. at 570, \n576โ77. Moreover, the claim in Taylor was that the state legislature had denied candidates for \nthose positions due process when resolving a contested election, a context far less analogous to \nCookโs situation than the for cause termination due process precedents. Subsequent cases applying \nTaylor emphasized that it addressed whether โunlawful denial by state action of a right to state \npolitical office is . . . a denial of a right of property.โ Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 7 (1944) \n(emphasis added). Taylor thus does not govern this case. And even modern courts that have \nfollowed Taylorโs holding with respect to cases involving elected officials have noted that since \nTaylor, the Supreme Court โhas adopted a more expansive approach to identifying โpropertyโ in \nthe due process context.โ Velez v. Levy, 401 F.3d 75, 86โ87 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Bd. of Regents \nof State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).  \nNor  does  Crenshaw  v.  United  States,  134  U.S.  99,  104  (1890)โanother  case  the \nGovernment  citesโsupport  applying  the  logic  of  Taylor  to  appointed  officers  like  Cook. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 31 of 49\nCrenshaw involved a cadet who enrolled in the Navy at a time when statutes provided that \nsuccessful graduates would โreceive appointments as midshipmen,โ and that โno officer in the \nmilitary or naval serviceโ would โbe dismissed from the service except upon, and in pursuance of, \nthe sentence of a court-martial to that effect.โ Id. at 100. During the cadetโs training, Congress \nchanged the law and limited the number of cadets who would become officers each year, and as a \nresult, the cadet was not appointed to a midshipman position after graduation. Id. at 101. He sued, \narguing that the change in legislation deprived him of a statutorily-created right to โserve for life, \nor during good behavior.โ Id. at 103. Taking up the case, the Court framed the question as whether \nan โofficer appointed for a definite time, or during good behavior, had any vested interest or \ncontract right in his office of which [C]ongress could not deprive him,โ and found no such right. \nId. at 104.  \nThe text of Crenshaw makes clear that the question was whether, assuming the truth of the \nplaintiffโs argument that he was entitled to lifetime tenure by statute, Congress was prohibited \nfrom passing a law that would modify that tenure. Id. at 104, 109; see Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 \nU.S. 530, 534 (1962) (stating that Crenshaw held that โneither the tenure nor salary of federal \nofficers is constitutionally protected from impairment by Congressโ). There is no inconsistency \nbetween finding a property right in Cookโs โfor causeโ protected position under the existing statute, \nand also acknowledging that Congress, should it desire, would not offend due process by passing \na statute reorganizing the Federal Reserve and eliminating her position. This is because it is \nCongress that has โcreatedโ and โdefinedโ the โdimensionsโ of the property, in this case, through \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 32 of 49\nstatute. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 538. Crenshaw stands merely for the proposition that Congress is \nnot prohibited from amending or repealing the statute that gives rise to the property right.11  \nThe Court thus finds that the existing precedent regarding the protectable rights of public \nofficeholders does not apply to the situation of an independent agency Board member such as \nCook, who, along with the Federal Reserve itself, occupies a unique space in the American \nadministrative structure. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415 (โThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, \nquasi-private entity.โ). Further, the Court must account for the Supreme Courtโs more recent \nprecedents that cast a broader scope as to the protectable interests under the due process clause. \nThe analysis in Loudermill and the cases that follow it do not hinge on the statusโpublic employee \nor officerโof the individuals in question. โLiberty and property are broad and majestic terms,โ \nRoth, 408 U.S. at 571, and the analysis established in Loudermill and Roth, while focused on public \nemployment, was not limited to that context, see id. at 576 (noting that โproperty interestsโ may \nโtake many formsโ). The key issue in these cases was whether the individual had a โlegitimate \nclaim of entitlementโ to the property interest claimed, a claim that may stem from existing statutory \nor regulatory understandings. Id. at 577โ78. The plain language of the Federal Reserve Actโs \nfourteen-year term and โfor causeโ removal provision create that understanding. 12 U.S.C. ยง 242.  \nThe Court thus finds that at this preliminary stage, Cook is likely to succeed on her \nargument that she has a protected property interest in her โfor causeโ-protected role as a member \nof the Board of Governors. \n \n \n11 The discussion of the plaintiffโs alleged property right in Crenshaw is also likely dicta. The Court in Crenshaw \naddressed whether the plaintiff had a โvested interest or contract right in his office,โ id. at 104, only because it was \nassuming that โthe term of office enjoyed by the [plaintiff] was what he claims it to have been,โa term for life,โ id. \nat 109. But the Court went on to find that โeven if that were true as to other officers,โ it was not true for the plaintiff \nin that case, because he had โexecuted a bond to serve for eight years, unless discharged by competent authority,โ and \ntherefore should have โrecogniz[ed] his liability to be discharged.โ Id.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 33 of 49\nii.  Cook Did Not Receive Sufficient Process for Her Removal. \nHaving  determined  that  Cook  was  deprived  of  a  protected  interest,  the  Court  must \ndetermine โwhether she received the process she was due.โ Esparraguera, 101 F.4th at 33 (citing \nBd. of Trs. of UDC, 56 F.3d at 1471). โDue process is flexible and calls for such procedural \nprotections as the particular situation demands.โ Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976). \nIn determining proper process, a Court must balance (1) the private interest affected by the \ngovernment action; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation and the value of additional safeguards; \nand (3) the governmentโs interest, including the fiscal and financial burdens that additional or \nsubstitute procedural requirements would entail. Propert v. District of Columbia, 948 F.2d 1327, \n1332 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (citing Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335). โAn essential principle of due process is \nthat a deprivation of life, liberty, or property โbe preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing \nappropriate to the nature of the case.โโ Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542 (quoting Mullane v. Cent. \nHanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313 (1950)). The opportunity to be heard must be given \nโat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.โ Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 \n(1965). \nCook argues that she was at minimum entitled to โoral or written notice of the charges,โ an \nโexplanation of the . . . evidence,โ and โan opportunity to present [her] side of the story,โ as were \nthe discharged individuals in Loudermill. 470 U.S. at 546; see ECF 2-1 at 20. The Government \nretorts that, even if applicable to Cookโs case, those requirements were satisfied here. It asserts \nthat notice was provided when the President โpublicized the FHFA referral on August 20, 2025.โ \nECF 13 at 22. Recall, that was the date that President Trump shared a Bloomberg news story on \nhis social media platform about Director Pulteโs referral letter and stated โCook must resign, \nnow!!!โ Id. (citing ECF 1 ยถ 43โ44). As for opportunity to be heard, the Government appears to \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 34 of 49\nargue that this requirement was satisfied by the fact that President Trump waited five days after \nhis August 20 Truth Social post โbefore proceeding with the threatened termination.โ ECF 13 at \n5, 23. The Government argues that Cook had the opportunity to contest the allegations in the days \nbefore the President fired her and simply failed to do so. Id.  \nThe Court finds that the due process requirements laid out by the Supreme Court in \nLoudermill apply to Cookโs case. And based on the record currently before it, the Court doubts \nthat Cook received any notice or opportunity to be heard, let alone notice and a hearing that were \nconstitutionally โmeaningful.โ Esparraguera, 101 F.4th at 33. It is difficult to construe President \nTrumpโs social media post on August 20, 2025, which itself linked to a third-party news article \nregarding Director Pulteโs allegations, as โwritten notice of the charges against [her].โ Loudermill, \n470 U.S. at 546. While President Trumpโs comments to reporters on August 22 arguably indicated \nthat President Trump was considering firing Cook, they fall short of providing Cook with an \nโexplanation of the . . . evidenceโ that President Trump was considering in weighing his dismissal \ndecision. Id.; see Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624, 627 (1977) (โThe purpose of such notice and \nhearing is to provide the person an opportunity to clear h[er] name.โ). Even if President Trumpโs \nstatements could be considered as having incorporated Director Pulteโs August 20, 2025, social \nmedia post, this was also insufficient notice. Pulteโs post included a screenshot of two pages of an \napparently longer letter sent to the Department of Justice, which itself contained corresponding \nexhibits. ECF 1-2 at 2โ3. The Government does not claim that President Trump, Director Pulte, or \ntheir staff sent the referral letter or its supporting materials to Cook, despite the fact that the \nPresident cited and incorporated the DOJ referral letter in his letter informing Cook of her \ntermination. ECF 1-3 at 2. Thus, on the record currently before the Court, it appears that President \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 35 of 49\nTrump did not provide her with the โevidence that formed the factual basis of her removal.โ \nEsparraguera, 101 F.4th at 40.  \nThe Government argues that Cook has received actual notice of the allegations against her \nand President Trumpโs intention to remove her. See ECF 23 at 16 (citing United Student Aid Funds, \nInc.  v.  Espinosa,  559  U.S.  260,  272  (2010)  (finding  under  the  circumstances  that  โactual \nnotice . . . more than satisfied [the partyโs] due process rightsโ)). The Court disagrees. The point \nof notice in the termination cases is to provide the employee โnotice of the charges against themโ \nand โexplanation of the employerโs evidence,โ Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546, so as to โprovide the \nperson an opportunity to clear h[er] nameโ Velger, 429 U.S. at 627. The Court is highly doubtful \nthat Cook should have been required to piece together the evidentiary basis for a โfor causeโ \nremoval from a scattered assortment of social media posts and news articles.  \nEven  if  the  notice  provided  had  been  sufficient,  Cookโs  due  process  rights  were \nnevertheless likely violated because she was not given a โmeaningful opportunityโ to be heard. \nLoudermill, 470 U.S. at 543. At no point did President Trump indicate that Cook would be \nprovided an opportunity to argue that the allegations were untrue or did not merit removal, or invite \nCook to submit such evidence. See id. at 543โ46 (requiring that, at minimum, the pretermination \nopportunity to be heard should allow for a โmeaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the \ndecisionmakerโ and include sufficient process to allow the decisionmaker to determine โwhether \nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support \nthe proposed actionโ). Instead, shortly after Director Pulteโs social media post was made public, \nPresident Trump called for Cook to resignโa far cry from inviting an opportunity to contest the \nallegations. See ECF 1 ยถ 44. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 36 of 49\nHaving found that Cook likely did not receive any due process in her removal, the Court \ncould stop there. The Court need not at this preliminary posture identify the โprecise form of notice \nand the precise kind of hearing requiredโ by the Due Process Clause for a โfor causeโ protected \nagency board member. Propert, 948 F.2d at 1332. However, a preliminary consideration of the \ntraditional Mathews factors further demonstrates why it makes sense to apply the Loudermill \nframework to Cookโs case, and why an individual in Cookโs position is likely entitled to at least \nas much process as the individuals in Loudermill.  \n First, much like the employee in Loudermill, Cookโs โprivate interest in retainingโ her \ntenure-protected position is strong. 470 U.S. at 543. And unlike the employees in Loudermill, \nwhose interest in retaining employment was significant despite the fact that they โmay find \nemployment elsewhere,โ Cookโs role as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors is \nnot easily replaceable. See id. Second, considering the risk of erroneous deprivation and the \nbenefits of additional safeguards, as in Loudermill, โsome opportunity for [Cook] to present [her] \nside of the case is . . . of obvious value in reaching an accurate decision,โ given that โ[d]ismissals \nfor cause will often involve factual disputes.โ Id.  \n  The third Mathews factor, the โgovernmentโs interest,โ is far more complicated in this case. \nAssuming for the purpose of the analysis that President Trump had shown sufficient cause to \nremove  Cook,  President  Trump  undoubtedly  shares  the  same  interest  as  the  employer  in \nLoudermill, the โexpeditious removal of an unsatisfactoryโ Board member and โthe avoidance of \nadministrative burdens.โ 470 U.S. at 543. In addition, as the head of the Executive Branch, \nPresident Trump has significant interests in effectively exercising the โexecutive Powerโ and \ncarrying out his obligations under the Take Care Clause, see U.S. Const. art. II, ยงยง 1, 3, which \npoint in favor of expeditious removal in cases where the actions meriting removal are serious or \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 37 of 49\negregious. Thus, the interest in expeditious removal weighs heavily in favor of President Trump. \nOn the other hand, the potential administrative burdens of providing notice and a hearing to Cook \ndo not weigh as strongly in the Presidentโs favor. This is the first โfor causeโ removal in the Federal \nReserveโs  history.  Contested  โfor  causeโ  removals  of  other  independent  agency  and  board \nmembersโspecifically on the basis that they met the statutory standard for removalโhave been \nfew and far between. See Breger & Edles at 1149โ50. The infrequency of these kinds of removals \n(compared to the entire Ohio civil service in Loudermill, or recipients of federal disability benefits \nin Mathews, where the burdens pointed in favor of less elaborate hearing procedures) indicates \nthat the total โsocietal costsโ to the Government of providing notice and a hearing in cases like \nCookโs  would  be  lowโeven  were  the  hearing  to  be  one  that  involved  formal  evidentiary \npresentation. Mathews, 424 U.S. at 347; see Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 535. Moreover, as discussed \nbelow, there is historical precedent for robust pre-removal procedures that do not unduly infringe \non the Presidentโs prerogatives but still comport with the requirements of due process.  \nFurther,  the  interests  of  the  President  as  chief  executive  represent  only  part  of  the \nGovernmentโs interest in this case. See Mathews, 424 U.S. at 347 (defining the relevant interest as \nthe โpublic interestโ). Also at play are the interests of Congress, which enacted the โfor causeโ \nprovision in the first place and thus made a deliberate choice to structure the Federal Reserve Board \nof Governors as an independent body โfree to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance \nof any other official or any department of the government.โ Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 625โ\n26. Congress thus has an interest in ensuring the fair treatment of the Board members by the \nExecutive Branch. While not all of the considerations in analyzing the Mathews factors point in \nher favor, on balance, they support providing Cook and those in a similar position a pre-deprivation \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 38 of 49\nopportunity to contest the record and determine whether the factual allegations indeed state a \nstatutorily required โcause.โ   \nIndeed,  the  limited  historical  practice  that  exists  regarding  removals  of  โfor  causeโ \nprotected officials suggests that a โfor causeโ removal by the President ought to comport with due \nprocess indicia like a formal evidentiary hearing, and that such a requirement would not be \nantithetical to the Presidentโs legitimate ability to remove officials who fail to meet the standard. \nSee Lee v. Garland, 120 F.4th 880, 891 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (โHistorical practice is important in \ndetermining the scope of executive power.โ). In 1913, President Taft removed two members of the \nBoard of Appraisers, who were protected from removal except for INM grounds, following an \nextensive inquiry by an investigative committee which involved fact-gathering, public hearings, \nand consideration of the membersโ rebuttals. See Aditya Bamzai, Taft, Frankfurter, and the First \nPresidential For-Cause Removal, 52 U. Rich. L. Rev. 691, 729โ37 (2018). Taft removed the \nofficers  following  the  committeeโs  final  report  and  Taftโs  finding  that  the  committee  had \nโsustainedโ the charges against the suspect board members. Id. at 737. When President Ford \nconsidered removing a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board that enjoyed protections limiting \nremoval to INM grounds, the Executive Branch requested that the board member participate in an \nโevidence-gathering inquiryโ presided over by the office of the White House Counsel. See Timm \nv. United States, 223 Ct. Cl. 639, 639โ40 (1980) (noting that Timm resigned before such a hearing \nwas held); see also Breger & Edles at 1150. The Court notes that these actual and proposed \nprocedures granted the removed officer a significant opportunity to confront the evidence against \nthem and make their case. They did not require that the President be the one to engage in fact-\ngathering and compilation of the evidence, and thus minimized the burden on the Presidentโs time \nand energy. However, at least in the case of the Taft removals, the President still had a key role in \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 39 of 49\nmaking a final review of the evidence and the officersโ rebuttals. While the Court declines to \nestablish the process due to Cook, it observes that these examples of historical executive process \ninclude the hallmarks of due processโmeaningful notice and an opportunity to be heard. \nBecause Cook received neither of these โfundamental due process requirement[s]โ with \nrespect to her termination, she is substantially likely to succeed on the merits of her due process \nclaim. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546.12  \nB.  Cook Faces Irreparable Harm. \nIn addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits, Cook must also establish that \nshe faces irreparable injury absent the requested preliminary relief. Natโl Min. Assโn v. Jackson, \n768 F. Supp. 2d 34, 50 (D.D.C. 2011); Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297. To constitute irreparable \ninjury,  the  injury  โmust  be  โboth  certain  and  great,โ  โactual  and  not  theoretical,โ  โbeyond \nremediation,โ and โof such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief to \nprevent  irreparable  harm.โโ  Mexichem  Specialty  Resins,  Inc.  v.  EPA,  787  F.3d  544,  555 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297). \n  The Court agrees with Cookโs argument that preventing her from discharging her duties as \na Federal Reserve Governor, a unique Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed role with \nsignificant responsibility, itself constitutes irreparable harm remediable only by her reinstatement. \nThe Government first contends that this theory of harm is barred by the Supreme Courtโs decision \nin Sampson v. Murray, which held that a federal employee seeking injunctive relief must โmake a \nshowing of irreparable injury sufficient in kind and degree to overrideโ the โobviously disruptive \n \n12 The Government argues that Cookโs due process challenge should fail because she has not identified arguments or \nevidence that would have changed the outcome in her case. First, the Court notes that Cook denies that she committed \nmortgage fraud, and is entitled to present evidence to the contrary at the proper time and place. ECF 17 at 15. Second, \nand more importantly, the โright to a hearing does not depend on a demonstration of certain success.โ Loudermill, 470 \nU.S. at 544. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 40 of 49\neffect which the grant of the temporary relief . . . [is] likely to have on the administrative process.โ \n415 U.S. 61, 83โ84 (1974). In Sampson, the Court noted that this concern would typically โcut[] \nagainst the general availability of preliminary injunctions in Government personnel cases.โ Id. \nSampson dealt with the firing of a probationary employee, who had failed to establish irreparable \nharm beyond mere economic loss or reputational harm. Id. at 62, 91โ92. But Sampson held out \nthat there may well be cases that โso far depart from the normal situation that irreparable injury \nmight be found,โ and that a district court will have the authority to grant injunctive relief โin [that] \ngenuinely extraordinary situation.โ Id. at 92 n.68. \n  Cook is correct that other courts in this district have almost uniformly found irreparable \nharm sufficient to meet the โgenuinely extraordinaryโ exception in Sampson, id., when confronted \nwith a claim that an official is being wrongfully deprived of their โstatutory right to function,โ \nparticularly when the official occupies a Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed, fixed-term \nrole.

Supp. 3d 307, 336 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (rejecting acting director of the CFPBโs โstatutory right to functionโ claim because \nโshe would not be entitled to that position even if the Court granted her an injunctionโ). These \ncourts have found that being removed from a โPresidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed, high-\nranking,  public  servant  roleโ  is  โdifferent  in  caliber  and  kind  fromโ  the  typical  employee \nreinstatement cases. Slaughter, 2025 WL 1984396, at *18. This is because these roles involve the \nโability to influence federal decision-makingโ at a high level. Id. \nMany of these cases have also found it appropriate to take into account the harm that the \nofficialโs removal would have on the agency or board and its ability to function. See, e.g., Berry, \n1983 WL 538, at *5 (finding irreparable harm partially because โthe Commissionโs ability to fulfill \nits mandate [was] disrupted by the [plaintiffsโ] removal,โ which left the Commission โwithout a \nquorumโ);  LeBlanc,  2025  WL  1454010,  at  *32  (finding  irreparable  harm  where  removals \nโimped[ed] the ability of the [board] to function as an independent watchdog . . . as envisioned by \nCongressโ); Harris, 775 F. Supp. 3d at 97 (acknowledging harms to the boardโs โcongressionally \nmandated independenceโ by board memberโs firing); Aviel, 2025 WL 2374618, at *16 (finding \nadditional harm because removed officialโs โfate [was] intertwined with the [agencyโs] very \nsurvivalโ); Slaughter, 2025 WL 1984396, at *18 (โ[Plaintiff] also helps run a multimember \ncommission that is free to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other official \nor any department of the government. . . . Permitting her removal necessarily destroys that \nlegislatively crafted independence in a way that injures [Plaintiff], the FTC, and Congress.โ).  \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 42 of 49\nThe Government counters that the decisions embracing the kinds of harm Cook alleges \nhere should not have persuasive force because many of them have been stayed on appeal. ECF 13 \nat 25โ26. That is not the whole story. In several of the cases a stay was either not granted or not \nsought by the Government in the first place, meaning that they have persuasive value. See Aviel, \n780 F. Supp. 3d at 14; Aviel, 2025 WL 2374618, at *15; see also Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5, \nvacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir 1983). In one of the cases, the D.C. Circuit stayed the \nlower courtโs decision but did not include any reasoning for doing so beyond citing to the \ntraditional stay factors, leaving this Court unable to determine how and whether the grant of the \nstay weighs on the merits of Cookโs case. Harper v. Bessent, No. 25-5268, 2025 WL 2426660, at \n*1 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 21, 2025). Such a stay order is โnot a decision on the merits.โ Merrill v. \nMilligan, 142 S. Ct. 879, 879 (2022) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in grant of application for stays).  \nAs for the cases that have been stayed, the Court is not persuaded that those stay decisions \nundermine the district courtsโ logic on irreparable harm as applied to this case. To start, the \nSupreme Courtโs stay order in Trump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415, does not speak to whether \nCook has adequately demonstrated irreparable harm here. In Wilcox, the Supreme Court granted \nstays of two district courtsโ reinstatements of members of the National Labor Relations Board and \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board because (1) the plaintiffs had failed to show that they would \nsucceed on their merits challenges, which are significantly different from Cookโs, and (2) because \nthe  harms  to  the  plaintiffs  from  โbeing  unable  to  perform  [their]  statutory  dut[ies]โ  were \noutweighed by the โgreater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue \nexercising the executive power.โ Id. Wilcox did not directly address whether the harm to the \nremoved  officer  was  irreparable,  and  only  stated  that  such  a  harm  did  not  outweigh  the \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 43 of 49\nGovernmentโs greater harm in having the removed officer โexercise the executive power.โ Id.13 \nThe Government notes  that Chief Justice Roberts recently issued an administrative stay in \nSlaughter, one of the district court cases supporting Cookโs theory of irreparable harm, pending \nfull briefing of the Governmentโs request to either stay the district courtโs judgment or grant \ncertiorari before judgment. See Trump v. Slaughter, No. 25A264, 2025 WL 2582814, (U.S. Sept. \n8, 2025); ECF 26. But a nonprecedential administrative stay order provides no basis to doubt the \nlogic of Slaughter as applied to this case. United States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. 797, 798 (2024) \n(Barrett, J. concurring in denial of applications to vacate stay) (โAdministrative stays do not \ntypically reflect the courtโs consideration of the merits of the stay application.โ).  \nCookโs argument is also not foreclosed by the D.C. Circuitโs decision staying the district \ncourtโs  order  in  Dellinger  v.  Bessent.  See  No.  25-5052,  2025  WL  887518,  at  *4 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar 10, 2025).  In  that  decision,  the  Circuit  granted  a  stay  of  the  district  courtโs \nreinstatement of Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger. The Circuit held that even if Dellingerโs \nremoval had been ultra vires, โthat [did] not mean such injury [was] irreparable and weigh[ed] in \nhis favor.โ Id. The panel held that the circumstances in that case โcut in favor of a stayโ pending \nappeal because, โ[a]t worst, Dellinger would remain out of office for a short period of time.โ Id. \nThe Circuit contrasted Dellingerโs harms with the substantial harms to the government of having \nits replacement special counsel โsidelined and unable to act while also having to try and unravel \nDellingerโs actions.โ Id.  \n \n13 For the same reasons, the stay in Trump v. Boyle does not resolve the question in this case, premised as it was on \nthe analysis in Wilcox that the โConsumer Product Safety Commission exercises executive powerโ in a similar manner \nas the National Labor Relations Board. 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025). And because the harm analysis in the LeBlanc \nand Grundmann stays by the D.C. Circuit were premised on the balance of harms theory endorsed by Wilcox, and did \nnot address the merits of the plaintiffsโ irreparable harm arguments, they do not provide reason to doubt the district \ncourtsโ analyses on that issue. See LeBlanc v. U.S. Priv. & C.L. Oversight Bd., No. 25-5197, 2025 WL 1840591, at *2 \n(D.C. Cir. July 1, 2025); Grundmann v. Trump, No. 25-5165, 2025 WL 1840641, at *1 (D.C. Cir. July 3, 2025), \nreconsideration en banc denied, No. 25-5165, 2025 WL 1995785 (D.C. Cir. July 16, 2025). \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 44 of 49\nThe โcircumstances of [this] particular caseโ differ from those of Dellingerโs and point in \nfavor of finding irreparable harm. Id. First, in the Circuitโs decision in Dellinger, as in Wilcox, the \nquestion before the D.C. Circuit was not the merits of Dellingerโs irreparable harm argument as \nendorsed by the district court below, but whether to grant the Governmentโs motion for a stay \npending appeal. The panelโs decision primarily focused on the balance of the equities. Id. at *2 \n(considering the issue as โweighing the relative harmโ). The panel found this prong supported the \nGovernmentโs stay โin the circumstances of [that] particular case,โ because of the strength of the \nGovernmentโs injury. Id. at *4. But here, the calculus is substantially different. In Dellinger, the \nplaintiff was the head of an independent agency that was nevertheless closely entwined with the \nrest of the Executive Branch. Upon his reinstatement by the district court, the plaintiff in Dellinger \nwas continuing to use his statutory powers as Special Counsel to stay the administrationโs \npersonnel decisions, and his reinstatement was thus found to pose significant and direct disruption \nto the administrationโs policy program and personnel decisions. Id. at *3. Cookโs retention on the \nBoard of Governors does not pose the same harms. She is one member of a multi-member body \nthat the Government concedes cannot be subject to policy pressure from the rest of the Executive \nBranch. Thus, her continued presence on the Board does not cause a similar degree of harm. \nFinally, in Dellinger, the Circuitโs stay addressed only one harm to Dellinger, the deprivation of \nhis โstatutory right to function in office,โ but Cook here presents additional harms that flow from \nthis  deprivation  that  the  D.C.  Circuit  did  not  consider,  including  those  to  the  agencyโs \nindependence and the possibility that President Trump will shortly move to replace her on the \nBoard. ECF 2-1 at 21โ22.  \nCook has shown irreparable harm. Through her removal, โshe has lost the ability to fulfill \na high-ranking, public-servant role to which she is entitled.โ Aviel, 2025 WL 2374618, at *15. As \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 45 of 49\na member of the Board of Governors, she has the โability to influence federal decision-makingโ \non issues of monetary policy, and serves as part of a โcongressionally protected agency that is \ndesigned to operate โindependent of executive authority.โโ Slaughter, 2025 WL 1984396, at *18 \n(citing Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at 625). She has โlost the power to guide,โ along with the other \nmembers of the Board of Governors, a โ[]century-old independent agency that serves the United \nStatesโโ interests in expert-driven monetary policy and banking stability. Aviel, 2025 WL 2374618, \nat *15. โLosingโ her โrole at an independent agency like theโ Federal Reserve, id. at *16, does not \ncompare to other employee terminations that  were not deemed irreparable, like that of the \nprobationary employee in Sampson. 415 U.S. at 90โ92. Her removal from the Board will result in \nmissed votes and lost time that cannot be remedied by backpay or reinstatement after the fact. See \nHarper, 2025 WL 2049207, at *13 (finding that similar injuries โcannot be retroactively cured by \nmonetary damagesโ). The Court agrees with the many others in this district that Cookโs removal \nqualifies as irreparable harm sufficient to support preliminary relief in the form of reappointment \nto her position. As a result, the Court need not address Cookโs remaining grounds for irreparable \nharm at this time.14  \nC.  The Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest Favor Cookโs Requested \nRelief. \n \nThe final two stay factors, which merge here, strongly cut in Cookโs favor. Cook has \ndemonstrated an ongoing irreparable harm. Against that harm, the Government raises Wilcox, \nBoyle, and the D.C. Circuitโs stay in Dellinger, to argue that the Government suffers a greater harm \n \n14 The Courtโs analysis on irreparable harm applies both to Cookโs claim that her removal was not โfor causeโ and \nthat she did not receive constitutionally sufficient process. The loss of her unique statutory position results from either \nviolation, a conclusion that the Government conceded at oral argument. See Hrโg Tr. at 72:21โ73:7 (noting, in response \nto the Courtโs question about whether the due process violation is itself a form of irreparable harm, that the harm was \nsimilar to the statutory-right-to-function cases, because โthe thing that is being deprived is the office or the \nemployment, which is the same thing as in all the other removal cases that weโve been talking aboutโ). \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 46 of 49\nin โallowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully \nremoved officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.โ ECF 13 at 25 (citing \nWilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415). It also raises the โdisruptive effect of the repeated removal and \nreinstatement of officers during the pendency of this litigation.โ Id. at 29 (citing Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. \nat 1415).  \nAgain, the Court is not persuaded that the harms cash out here as they did in Wilcox and \nBoyle. First, Cookโs retention on the Board of Governors does not offend the Presidentโs Article II \nauthority in the way the officersโ reinstatement was found to in Wilcox and Boyle. See supra n.13. \nWilcoxโs theory of harm was premised on the ground that the Government suffered from having a \nreinstated officer exercise the โexecutive power.โ Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415. But the Supreme \nCourt in Wilcox expressly disclaimed that its analysis on this issue implicated the โuniquely \nstructured, quasi-private entityโ that is the Federal Reserve. Id. Here, Cook is one of seven \nmembers of a Board that is, by design, not intended to be susceptible to policy pressure, let alone \ntasked with implementing the Presidentโs agenda. One could frame the Governmentโs harm as an \ninjury to the Presidentโs ability to faithfully execute the laws, which is undermined by being \nrequired to retain an individual on the Federal Reserve Board in whom he has stated that he lacks \nconfidence. But even in that case, the fact remains that in failing to specify legal โcause,โ President \nTrump has not identified anything related to Cookโs conduct or job performance as a Board \nmember that would indicate that she is harming the Board or the public interest by executing her \nduties unfaithfully or ineffectively. The Governmentโs claimed injuries carry less weight here than \nin Wilcox and Boyle. Dellinger also does not govern this case for the reasons discussed above.  \nFurther, the public interest in this case is not only limited to the interests of the Executive \nBranch. โ[T]here is a substantial public interest in having governmentalโ actors like the President \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 47 of 49\nโabide by the federal laws.โ League of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)). Congress, \nwhich  implemented  the  โfor  causeโ  protection  and  sought  to  secure  the  Federal  Reserveโs \nindependence, also has an interest in ensuring that Federal Reserve Board members are removed \nfor only statutorily permitted reasons, and preventing the President from โthwart[ing] . . . the very \nends which Congress sought to realize by definitively fixing the term of office.โ Humphreyโs Exโr, \n295 U.S. at 626.  \nFurther, the public interest in Federal Reserve independence weighs in favor of Cookโs \nreinstatement. That independence is critical in helping the nationโs โbanking system to promote \nstability.โ PHH Corp., 881 F.3d at 92 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 74-742, at 1). As Justice Kavanaugh \nhas observed, insulation of the Federal Reserve from โdirect presidential oversight or controlโ \nโmay be worthwhile,โ due to โits power to directly affect the short-term functioning of the U.S. \neconomy  by  setting  interest  rates  and  adjusting  the  money  supply.โ  Brett  M.  Kavanaugh, \nSeparation of Powers During the Forty-Fourth Presidency and Beyond, 93 Minn. L. Rev. 1454, \n1474 (2009). Others have put it more bluntly: Given this significant power and responsibility, \nโ[s]ubjecting the Fed[eral Reserve] to close political oversight would likely have harmful, perhaps \neven disastrous, consequences.โ Neil H. Buchanan & Michael C. Dorf, Donโt End or Audit the \nFed: Central Bank Independence in an Age of Austerity, 102 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 8 (2016). \nThe Court finds that the equitable factors weigh in favor of granting relief to Cook. \nD.  The Court Will Enter a Preliminary Injunction Against Defendants Powell and \nthe Board of Governors. \n \nBecause all four factors favor Cook, the Court will grant relief in her favor, in the form of \na preliminary injunction requiring Defendants Powell and the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve to allow Cook to remain a member of the Board during the pendency of this litigation. \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 27     Filed 09/09/25     Page 48 of 49\nThe Court acknowledges that Cook originally moved for a temporary restraining order. ECF 2. \nHowever, since then, the Court has held an adversarial hearing and received additional responsive \nbriefing from both Parties. See Aug. 29, 2025 Min. Entry; ECF 13, 17, 23, 24. Further, in the \nPartiesโ joint status report, counsel for the Government noted that they would not object to \nconverting Cookโs temporary restraining order motion into a request for a preliminary injunction, \nECF 20 at 3. The legal standard for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction are \nthe same. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 844 F. Supp. 2d at 101. โWhen the opposing party actually receives \nnotice of the application for a restraining order, the procedure that is followed does not differ \nfunctionally from that on an application for a preliminary injunction and the proceeding is not \nsubject to any special requirements.โ 11A Wright & Millerโs Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 2951 \n(3d ed. 2025). Here, given that there has been an adversarial hearing and additional briefing, \nCookโs request will be treated as one for a preliminary injunction. See id.  \n  The Court recognizes that it likely cannot directly โenjoin the President in the performance \nof his official dutiesโ to require him to reappoint Cook. Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042 \n(D.C. Cir. 2023) (citing Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802 (1992) (plurality opinion)). \nHowever, Cook can still be granted relief because the Circuit has recognized that a court can \nโenjoin โsubordinate executive officialsโ to reinstate a wrongly terminated official โde facto,โ even \nwithout a formal presidential reappointment.โ Id. at 1042โ43 (citing Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d \n973, 980 (1996)).  \nTherefore, the Court will enter an injunction directing Powell and the Board of Governors \nto allow Cook to continue to operate as a member of the Board for the pendency of this litigation. \nThe Government has requested that this Court stay its decision pending any appeal. ECF 20 at 3. \nThe Court declines to do so.

We'll start\n 6 with plaintiff's counsel first.\n 7 MR. LOWELL:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Abbe Lowell\n 8 from Lowell and Associates on behalf of Governor Cook.  Along\n 9 with me are co-counsel that are on the record and have been\n10 identified to the Court.\n11 THE COURT:  Okay.  Good morning, everyone.\n12 MR. ROTH:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Yaakov Roth on\n13 behalf of the President.  I'm here with John Bailey and Stephen\n14 Tagert.\n15 THE COURT:  Good morning.\n16 MR. CHADWICK:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Joshua\n17 Chadwick on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board.\n18 THE COURT:  Mr. Chadwick, I just want to clarify, it's\n19 my understanding that you're not intending to offer any\n20 argument.  You're here to the extent necessary to effectuate\n21 any potential injunctive relief, and you don't plan to weigh in\n22 on the merits separately from the DOJ; is that correct?\n23 MR. CHADWICK:  That's correct, Your Honor.  Obviously,\n24 this case raises important and consequential questions, but\n25 I'll leave the argument to Mr. Roth and Mr. Lowell.  But I'm of\n\n     3\n 1 course happy to answer any questions -- factual questions or\n 2 otherwise that Your Honor may have, but not staking out legal\n 3 positions today.\n 4 THE COURT:  Okay.  Fair enough.  Before we get\n 5 started, if I could just get an understanding of the\n 6 plaintiff's plans for next steps in terms of scheduling.  Do\n 7 you intend to also file a motion for preliminary injunction?\n 8 MR. LOWELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  This was something that\n 9 we needed to do as quickly as possible to get before you.  That\n10 is our plan.  And while you've asked me, I'd also point out\n11 that on my way into the courthouse today, I received a filing\n12 that the government made of 30-some-odd pages, which, to be\n13 honest, I have not had a chance to review or to incorporate.\n14 So it would be my plan, depending on the Court's schedule, to\n15 likely ask, depending on what you want, to respond to that\n16 before the Court rules.\n17 But to answer your question --\n18 THE COURT:  Yes, that was going to be one of my\n19 requests.  I do think that it would be helpful to have your\n20 response in writing to that.  When do you intend to file that?\n21 MR. LOWELL:  If the Court permits, we'll try -- I\n22 would say for sure we'll do it by -- I realize Monday is a\n23 holiday.  We'd do it over the weekend to get it done and file\n24 it over the weekend, if that's permissible with you.\n25 THE COURT:  You tell me.\n\n     4\n 1 MR. LOWELL:  I will do it by the end of the weekend,\n 2 for sure.\n 3 THE COURT:  Okay.  \n 4 MR. LOWELL:  So that was one.  And then in that regard\n 5 as well, depending on -- and it may be that we can do what Your\n 6 Honor's question sort of implies.  Because the Federal Reserve\n 7 Board is waiting for the Court's decision.\n 8 And so consequently, in terms of turning this into,\n 9 for example, an expedited preliminary injunction set of briefs,\n10 which might include what the government filed this morning,\n11 what I'm saying is they are not taking any action today and\n12 they won't take any action until the Court rules.  So the idea\n13 that we have to decide this based on the TRO, as opposed to\n14 your question as to whether we might turn this into a PI or\n15 even a summary judgment, we might be able to do that.\n16 THE COURT:  Since you're suggesting it, this case\n17 obviously raises some important questions that may be of first\n18 impressions, specifically as it relates to this Board.  I have\n19 not made a judgment about irreparable harm.  So I have to treat\n20 every TRO as if I need to address it immediately.\n21 But if there is room to set an expedited schedule that\n22 allows for all parties to not be -- I know even the government\n23 wrote a very helpful brief for its position but it did so\n24 overnight.  And so I certainly don't want the parties to not\n25 have time to make the arguments that they need to make.\n\n     5\n 1 I have questions today.  But I'm also happy to set an\n 2 expedited schedule for briefing this on the merits in a very\n 3 short time frame, but that allows the parties to fully present\n 4 their arguments.\n 5 MR. LOWELL:  That, in a case like this, makes perfect\n 6 sense to me, with the following understanding, however.\n 7 We came to you for a TRO.\n 8 THE COURT:  Right.\n 9 MR. LOWELL:  Because it was very unclear whether when\n10 the President uses his vehicle of choice, social media post, to\n11 fire somebody, that the Fed would either say that's not the way\n12 to do it or it would say it is the way to do it or to say we\n13 need to consider if it's the way to do it.\n14 Governor Cook, we believe, is in her position as she\n15 was confirmed to be.  If nobody is going to try to change that\n16 until we get the Court's decision on whatever expedition makes\n17 sense, we're satisfied to do it in the order that you just\n18 suggested.\n19 If she has the ability to carry out her constitutional\n20 function.  If she has the ability to do her job as the\n21 Governor.  If nobody is locking her out of her office.  If\n22 nobody is taking her salary away.  If nobody is preventing her\n23 from being a governor, then we will conform to a schedule.  And\n24 as I said, I don't know.\n25 However, if the Fed decides, okay, this -- they talk\n\n     6\n 1 about uncertainty and it is, I understand from their position,\n 2 uncertain.  We don't think it's so uncertain, given the law.\n 3 But that being the case, we can do the schedule as\n 4 long as we're here to preserve the status quo ante.  And if\n 5 we're going to preserve that, then we have the ability to\n 6 conform to whatever schedule the Court wants.  And I know\n 7 that's a much longer-winded answer to your short question.\n 8 THE COURT:  And there's a lot packed in there,\n 9 including, essentially, if everyone can agree to the relief\n10 sought then we can have a briefing schedule that's longer.\n11 MR. LOWELL:  Indeed.  And if that's not the case, then\n12 that's why I'm standing at your podium this morning.\n13 THE COURT:  Okay.  I thought I was understanding you\n14 to say that while there is a significant time pressure, there's\n15 not an overnight time pressure.\n16 MR. LOWELL:  I feel that that's true, given what the\n17 Fed has said their position is and they're here.  I think\n18 that's probably right.\n19 THE COURT:  I wasn't suggesting a months long -- I was\n20 suggesting an expedited briefing schedule over the next week or\n21 two.\n22 MR. LOWELL:  On a preliminary injunction, that would\n23 make sense.\n24 THE COURT:  Yes.  Either preliminary injunction or\n25 expedited summary judgment briefing.\n\n     7\n 1 I actually have a lot of questions about how you\n 2 propose a Court deal with the pretext issue and whether -- that\n 3 does not feel like a question of law.  It feels very fact\n 4 based.\n 5 And so I guess my question is, does the PI motion\n 6 resemble the ultimate summary judgment brief?  If it's going to\n 7 be the same briefs, then we might as well just do an expedited\n 8 summary judgment schedule and just get the merits of the case\n 9 resolved.\n10 MR. LOWELL:  For a procedural certainty for the issues\n11 that you know and are suggesting exist in this case, that would\n12 make sense.\n13 THE COURT:  Okay.\n14 MR. LOWELL:  Except for my caveat, which is the\n15 Governor has the right to remain as a Governor until such time\n16 as this Court, and then any other Court, depending on the\n17 ruling.  That being the case, it may be that we move to what\n18 you just said, which is not your first question on preliminary\n19 injunction but might be an expedited summary judgment.\n20 As you just raised, we have this phenomenon in this\n21 administration, which I am totally unused to but it's very\n22 helpful to be making these arguments, where I don't know what\n23 additional discovery on, for example, pretext I might need,\n24 because the President and the guy that carries out his orders,\n25 William Pulte, is so vocal in public about what they say that a\n\n     8\n 1 court or trier or fact could make the inferences necessary just\n 2 from what they said, which I will get to when we get to arguing\n 3 or answering your questions.\n 4 So I can't get ahead of the Court on this to tell you\n 5 on a summary judgment if there's anything other than what's\n 6 already out there in public that we would need to brief that.\n 7 I will do that promptly if that's the schedule we do.\n 8 I've started thinking about it before I came here today because\n 9 I realized that there was an issue of whether this has been a\n10 pretext from the beginning.\n11 I don't know what else I would need.\n12 So as we progress, Your Honor, if we can, we can\n13 figure what would be the need for any discovery when I answer\n14 your questions on the pretext part.  And then we could see\n15 whether it informs your view that this should be a summary\n16 judgment or a preliminary injunction beyond 5:00 today.  Does\n17 that make sense?\n18 THE COURT:  Yes.  So you're going to file your written\n19 response to the government's opposition by --\n20 MR. LOWELL:  We could do it by the end of the day, to\n21 be honest.  I suspect it would be more likely --\n22 THE COURT:  I'm not --\n23 MR. LOWELL:  It could be Monday.\n24 THE COURT:  You don't need to do that for my benefit.\n25 It's your motion.  If you feel that you can get it in -- Monday\n\n     9\n 1 is a holiday, so Monday or I would say Tuesday morning.\n 2 MR. LOWELL:  I would say early by the first thing on\n 3 Tuesday morning.\n 4 THE COURT:  Yes.  If that works for you, then that\n 5 works for me.\n 6 MR. LOWELL:  It works for us.  And I'm not uncognizant\n 7 of the fact that you and everybody that is working is working,\n 8 and this is supposed to be, quote, Labor Day weekend.  So I\n 9 think it's supposed to be the opposite of doing labor, but on\n10 the other hand, we don't mind doing the labor.\n11 THE COURT:  So maybe we'll talk scheduling at the end.\n12 But can I get the government's position or reaction to what was\n13 just said about scheduling?\n14 MR. ROTH:  Sure, Your Honor.  I'm not totally sure how\n15 to react.  I mean, part of what he was saying sounded like\n16 they're happy to extend it if they get a TRO in the meantime.\n17 It's not our position.\n18 THE COURT:  Okay.\n19 MR. ROTH:  It's their motion.  We certainly don't have\n20 an objection to converting it to a PI motion.  That might make\n21 sense, given that we have full briefing already and we'll\n22 certainly have complete briefing, it sounds like, within one\n23 business day.  So treating it as a PI rather than a TRO might\n24 be sensible.  We would not oppose that.  If the plaintiff wants\n25 to seek expedited summary judgment, they can do that.  I don't\n\n    10\n 1 really have a position on that.\n 2 MR. LOWELL:  One more thing -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\n 3 THE COURT:  Come on up.\n 4 MR. LOWELL:  One more thing to keep in mind.  You did\n 5 already point out what I think everybody knows.  This very well\n 6 may be some issues of first impression.  I think you've already\n 7 seen -- I think there may even have been a filing already but I\n 8 haven't been able to read it -- that there are people in the\n 9 country, scholars, academicians, former Board governors.  \n10 So whatever our merits argument were should also\n11 envision some schedule in which amicus may participate.  This\n12 would be a case in which I think that would be helpful to the\n13 Court, certainly to the parties.  These are issues in which\n14 various people who have written or teach or have actually\n15 served as governors may like to be heard.\n16 So if we're going to do that schedule, I'd like to\n17 incorporate an idea of when something like that would be due\n18 for both sides.  In fact, I think the first filing, lord knows\n19 how that person was able to figure it out, wants to be amicus\n20 on the side that what the President did was fine.\n21 THE COURT:  And while you brought that up, any\n22 objection to me granting leave for that brief to be filed?\n23 MR. LOWELL:  I didn't see it to know.  But Your Honor,\n24 I believe the Court should accept amicus unless it's\n25 completely, you know, somebody that's sitting in a mountain\n\n    11\n 1 cabin that has nothing to say other than I want to be heard,\n 2 yes.\n 3 But I think we have to do it on an individual basis.\n 4 I think this applicant probably meets the standard of let's\n 5 hear what this applicant has to say, but I know there will be\n 6 others.\n 7 THE COURT:  Any objection from the government to me\n 8 just granting that motion?\n 9 MR. ROTH:  No.  We generally consent to amicus filing.\n10 THE COURT:  I will reflect on the order that that\n11 motion for leave to file is granted.  \n12 Why don't we talk about the merits a little bit and\n13 then circle back to scheduling at the end, because I'd like to\n14 leave here with a clear schedule of next steps.\n15 So I'll hear from plaintiffs.\n16 MR. LOWELL:  Thank you, Your Honor.  And especially in\n17 light of what you said, I think what I'd like to do is be as\n18 brief as to what I think the Court has to consider for purposes\n19 of keeping the status quo in place while the rest takes place.\n20 And it can be boiled down to a handful of what I'll\n21 call the operative facts to maintain the status quo.  And these\n22 operative facts are as follows.\n23 Governor Cook, an extraordinarily qualified economist\n24 and professor, was nominated and confirmed to a 14-year term to\n25 the Federal Reserve Board to end on 2038.  \n\n    12\n 1 On August the 25th at around 8:00 in the evening,\n 2 pursuant to a social media post, the President purported to\n 3 fire her, citing that he has that ability generally under\n 4 Article 2, but specifically stating, because he at least read\n 5 the statute, that he had to intone the word \"for cause,\" which\n 6 he did.\n 7 And unlike other cases, of which the government will\n 8 probably bring to your attention, for example, the one about\n 9 the Harper case on the NCUA, this statute embeds for cause in\n10 its very terms.\n11 Cause, according to the President's action, was a\n12 released on August 20th, also by way of public communication in\n13 social media, of a referral letter that was dated five days\n14 before but for which Governor Cook had no notice until it was\n15 posted publicly for the world, sent by FHFA Director William\n16 Pulte saying -- and I think the words matter, Your Honor, that,\n17 quote, it appears, end quote, that Governor Cook did something\n18 he deems to be wrong, for what he said, and I quote,\n19 potentially, end quote, did for some economic advantage.\n20 Not that she did it.  Not that there was any\n21 investigation or charge, but just this person's view of what he\n22 said, quote, appears, end quote, to be the case.\n23 It took the President barely 30 minutes using that\n24 public tweet, saying what it said, to demand that Governor Cook\n25 resign.\n\n    13\n 1 Now turning Director Pulte's, quote, appears, end\n 2 quote, and, quote, potentially, end quote, to what he said was,\n 3 quote, what she did was very bad, end quote.\n 4 THE COURT:  Can I interrupt?\n 5 MR. LOWELL:  Sure.\n 6 THE COURT:  Can we just pause on the cause piece?  And\n 7 I know you're going to file a written response to the\n 8 government's opposition.  But you're arguing that I should\n 9 interpret \"cause\" as has been defined in other statutes that\n10 provide specific grounds for cause for some boards and\n11 agencies.\n12 The government is saying where cause is not defined,\n13 it's actually statutory interpretation 101 that I consider the\n14 plain meaning because Congress made a deliberate decision not\n15 to define \"cause,\" and that that gives discretion to the\n16 President in that instance.  And so I think I'm -- I know you\n17 will respond to it in writing.\n18 MR. LOWELL:  I can respond to it now, too.\n19 THE COURT:  Yes.  But when you respond in writing, it\n20 would be very helpful to point to authority as to your response\n21 as to why the absence of a specific definition means that I\n22 kind of incorporate by reference the definition that might be\n23 provided in other statutes.\n24 MR. LOWELL:  Here's the Court's dilemma or here's the\n25 Court's choice.  If the words \"for cause\" appear in a statute,\n\n    14\n 1 and we agree it doesn't have a defining section in that same\n 2 statute for what cause, then the Court has to make a choice.\n 3 Either it means nothing, in which the President\n 4 decides what \"cause\" is when he says it, like Humpty Dumpty\n 5 deciding what word means when he says it, or it has to have\n 6 some grounds in something that we can rely on.\n 7 There are two possibilities there.  The first is to\n 8 look at the statutes which have traditionally defined \"for\n 9 cause\" and the cases interpreting it, which are the ones, for\n10 example, about what we call the IMN, the malfeasance and\n11 neglect of duty, or you can look to see if there is a different\n12 statute -- and the cases have talked about some which include\n13 phrases like \"mental incapacity\" or \"physical disability.\"\n14 That's not this.  That's a case in which the statute\n15 itself basically left the framework of what is generally\n16 accepted to be public misconduct, like malfeasance, neglect of\n17 duty and inefficiency.\n18 THE COURT:  But my question is where other statutes\n19 have provided that and this one doesn't, what is your response\n20 to that must have been a deliberate choice and that this means\n21 something different than what's outlined in those other\n22 statutes?\n23 MR. LOWELL:  But because the statute doesn't have its\n24 definition section, where should we look for that definition?\n25 Why don't we look at when Congress passed that statute and what\n\n    15\n 1 they had going on at the time.  And as we pointed out in our\n 2 papers, what they had on at that time was the briefing,\n 3 litigation and argument in Humphrey's Executor.\n 4 And in Humphrey's Executor of the statute, the FTC\n 5 statute very clearly had those three elements as to what it\n 6 means to be for cause.  Couldn't be more explicit, that's what\n 7 it said.\n 8 Congress recognized the Humphrey's executive decision\n 9 as they were passing the Federal Reserve Act, and including the\n10 phrase \"for cause\" embedded in the statute.  They say that in\n11 their legislative history.  They said it on the debate.  They\n12 were asked to wait for the decision.  And when they did pass\n13 the statute with reference to Humphrey's Executor, they\n14 incorporated this 111 or more year definition of \"for cause.\"\n15 If Congress says, we are looking at a for-cause\n16 statute, and, by the way, Humphrey's Executor defines \"for\n17 cause\" and it says the IMN, it's not a big leap to say that\n18 that is a traditional way of interpreting official misconduct.\n19 THE COURT:  What about more recent Supreme Court\n20 precedent?  I'm thinking of Collins v. Yellen that I read or\n21 one could read as suggesting that a for-cause restriction gives\n22 the President more removal authority than what was at issue in\n23 Humphrey's?  Like how do I square that with --\n24 MR. LOWELL:  You square that in the context of what\n25 was at stake in both of those cases.  In the Seila case that's\n\n    16\n 1 referenced by the Collins case, remember that in the Collins\n 2 case you refer to, the distinctions are vast and apparent.\n 3 First, it is not the historic agency, which goes back\n 4 to how the Federal Reserve Act incorporates that.  It was not a\n 5 multi-member board.  It didn't have the dual functions of being\n 6 quasi legislative.  Interestingly enough, the parties in that\n 7 case originally didn't even contest that the decision was going\n 8 to violate the Separation of Powers Act.  And it was about a\n 9 single entity, the director.\n10 And that is where the President has more authority,\n11 and we concede that.  Because that's what the Supreme Court\n12 said and that's what it said in Collins, for example.  It says\n13 that there are, quote, prohibits even modest restrictions on\n14 the President to remove the head of an agency with a single top\n15 officer.\n16 So that line you quoted about having more authority in\n17 this context can't be unmoored from the context in which that\n18 line was written.  And that line was written in a case that had\n19 that single top officer and all the differences between that\n20 agency and the Federal Reserve.\n21 So you can take those words, as the government has\n22 done, and say, you see, he's got, quote, more discretion.  But\n23 that's like taking the words out of why it was written for what\n24 it was done.  That's where we would point the Court. \n25 THE COURT:  I understand that and I understand this is\n\n    17\n 1 a unique body.  I'm jumping around a little bit.\n 2 MR. LOWELL:  I'll follow your lead.\n 3 THE COURT:  Am I right that it's your position that\n 4 any conduct that predates confirmation cannot be a basis for\n 5 cause?  And if that is your position, where do I get that from,\n 6 the text of the statute or the precedent?  Is that, again, the\n 7 kind of inefficiency malfeasance in office?  Are you borrowing\n 8 the in-office from those statutes and asking me to read that\n 9 into this one?\n10 MR. LOWELL:  I think the answer is we're not taking\n11 that absolute position, certainly not at this point.  It\n12 certainly is a good starting point for the concept of why you\n13 get removed from office.\n14 THE COURT:  It's helpful for me to understand --\n15 MR. LOWELL:  We're not taking that extreme.\n16 THE COURT:  You're not taking that position.  So you\n17 make room -- we're going to have to discuss this in the\n18 discretion part but just to be clear, you're not taking the\n19 position that the fact that this alleged conduct predated\n20 confirmation is as a basis for it to not rise to the level of\n21 cause under the statute.\n22 You're making room for the possibility that it is\n23 within a President's discretion to remove someone for cause\n24 based on conduct that is maybe -- only comes to light\n25 post-confirmation but was something that the person did before\n\n    18\n 1 they took the position?\n 2 MR. LOWELL:  And you just added one of the elements I\n 3 would have asked you to consider in your question to me.  It is\n 4 not an absolute position but it will be sliding scale of a\n 5 number of factors.\n 6 Factor number one, was it known at the time of the\n 7 person's confirmation and addressed?  Because that would\n 8 basically also inform the requirement of giving a person in\n 9 that situation notice and opportunity to be heard.  \n10 What's the nature of the offense that occurred before\n11 the person became involved in the office for which that person\n12 is being removed?  What was the process by which that event was\n13 proven to be the case?  Is it an allegation on a social media\n14 tweet at 11:00 at night by the director of the FHA or is it\n15 something in which there was an adjudication?  \n16 A person who was convicted of bank fraud, who wants to\n17 be a bank regulator, and that conviction occurred five years\n18 before the person was nominated, and for whatever reason that\n19 didn't find its way into the confirmation, I could understand\n20 the President saying, oh, you know what, I don't know why you\n21 confirmed this person but this person shouldn't be on the board\n22 you confirmed him.  I don't know why the President would have\n23 nominated such a person.\n24 THE COURT:  So the President can then say, I don't\n25 agree that this person should have been confirmed?\n\n    19\n 1 MR. LOWELL:  That becomes a hypothetical that's going\n 2 to be really difficult in a 14-year term in which somebody\n 3 appoints the person in year one, a new President gets elected,\n 4 and a President who gets elected, whatever the person's motive\n 5 is, whether it's honestly they want to have good officers or\n 6 they want to affect the economic interest rate of the United\n 7 States, says I've changed the mind of the President's Office\n 8 and this person should have not been nominated to begin with.  \n 9 That's the slippery slope of where you go prior to the\n10 confirmation or the putting the person in power.  To pick an\n11 earlier moment could be for cause in its official, but that's\n12 not a hypothetical that we have to get to.  That's not a\n13 situation because of the facts of this case.\n14 So the scale, Your Honor, it seems to me, would be\n15 what is the alleged offense that occurred before?  What is the\n16 evidence of that offense that occurred before?  Did that person\n17 have the opportunity to contest that so-called offense that\n18 occurred before?  And if that was the case, what is its\n19 relationship to the kind of office that person is serving in?\n20 There are so many variables, which is why I said I\n21 can't say that it's absolutely impossible --\n22 THE COURT:  Everything you just articulated makes\n23 perfect sense and I think is something that anyone making these\n24 decisions should consider.  But if I were to adopt that and I\n25 was going to put a cite to say like see also or see EG or see\n\n    20\n 1 Supreme Court case that maps onto what you just said, where do\n 2 I get the authority for that?\n 3 MR. LOWELL:  Again, because we're in an area where the\n 4 only removals have occurred for people -- or not.  Sometimes\n 5 the President has said, I get to remove somebody because I said\n 6 so and Article 2 says I said so.\n 7 For example, one of the cases that we said -- I think\n 8 it was the PCAOB or the NCUI case, the President made no\n 9 qualms, is that he didn't have cause and he was doing it solely\n10 on his Article 2.\n11 So I don't know that you find a Supreme Court, let\n12 alone lower court, decision that says these are the factors and\n13 that's why you indicated that you might be in a case of first\n14 impression.\n15 THE COURT:  Is there any authority that suggests that\n16 if I were to do something like that, that I wouldn't get\n17 smacked down?  Basically, is there any authority you can point\n18 to from the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court that would find\n19 it appropriate for me to kind of articulate a framework by\n20 which the President exercises -- at least what the government's\n21 arguing is discretion and you may, in your written response,\n22 frame it a different way?\n23 MR. LOWELL:  I think that's what we'll do.  We will\n24 address your point in our written response.\n25 THE COURT:  Please address that.  Because if this is\n\n    21\n 1 the President within the President's discretion can remove for\n 2 cause, I would want to see your best authority that it would be\n 3 appropriate for a Court then to kind of articulate a framework\n 4 of all that must be considered before determining whether past\n 5 conduct could be something that's for cause.\n 6 MR. LOWELL:  And I think on that, Your Honor, I think\n 7 what I'm thinking, as I'm hearing you speak and I'm trying to\n 8 figure out what to do the address the question, which is not\n 9 easily found in other cases, is to flip the question.\n10 Which is, I don't know that you're going to be able\n11 to, in deciding on the merits of this case, explain which of\n12 the things have to exist for it to be some conduct that\n13 occurred before an office holder held office when the whole\n14 point of the for-cause statute is to remove an office holder,\n15 which instinctively means it was for some malfeasance in\n16 office, but we can get to that.  As opposed to the opposite,\n17 which is, well, what can it not be.\n18 That's what this case is really about, if you think\n19 about it.  We're arguing that it's very difficult to come up\n20 with an 11-page definition of what it is but it's not hard to\n21 come up with a one-sentence definition of what it's not.\n22 And what it's not is FHA director sending out a\n23 missive to the world that says maybe, I think, potentially, it\n24 seems like, it appears that maybe Governor Cook did something\n25 wrong.  And the President says, that's cause.\n\n    22\n 1 And so in the facts of this case, what we may have to\n 2 adjudicate is whatever it is, it's not this.\n 3 And I understand the Court has to address what it is\n 4 in some fashion, but I don't think the Court has to address\n 5 that to dispositively decide this matter.  But that is\n 6 something we will address.\n 7 THE COURT:  I think that goes nicely into the pretext\n 8 argument.  And if you could just explain a little bit more\n 9 about -- let's assume I were to agree that the circumstances\n10 strongly indicate that this was pretext.  I'm not saying I'm\n11 making that finding --\n12 MR. LOWELL:  I understand. \n13 THE COURT:  I'm just having a hypothetical so that we\n14 can just address the core issue is -- okay.  So then what does\n15 a Court do?  Because it seems to me that -- actually, let me\n16 take a step back.\n17 Does that mean that if there is legitimate cause,\n18 let's say there is a cause that everyone on both sides -- on\n19 all sides agrees, that person disappeared for two years and\n20 didn't come to any meetings and didn't do any work.  But it's\n21 also someone that a President has strong policy disagreements\n22 with, has not -- there's no love lost between them, they've\n23 made comments about each other and this is just the perfect\n24 opportunity now to remove someone that a President really wants\n25 to remove.\n\n    23\n 1 If the cause is legitimate, are you suggesting that I\n 2 have to find that it was the sole reason, and that despite\n 3 everyone's agreement that there was a cause in the world that\n 4 happened that could be legitimate, that I nonetheless would\n 5 have to inquire into was this the actual real motivation of the\n 6 action?\n 7 Because that's what I usually typically think pretext,\n 8 that there is a reason given.  There's a cause given.  But\n 9 that's not the real reason.  And we get to the motivation of\n10 the actor to figure out what was the real reason.\n11 Are you suggesting that that would be my inquiry in a\n12 case like that where everyone agreed that there was cause?\n13 MR. LOWELL:  No.\n14 THE COURT:  Okay.\n15 MR. LOWELL:  A President of the United States,\n16 especially this President of the United States, could have a\n17 really bad motive to take an action to impose his will on\n18 things which are unprecedented, like the independence of the\n19 Federal Reserve Board.\n20 And that motive could be something that he has\n21 articulated, and yet, the person against whom he is taking his\n22 action has actually done something for cause.\n23 THE COURT:  Okay.\n24 MR. LOWELL:  Motive would not bear on this Court's\n25 ability to confirm that whatever we define as permissible cause\n\n    24\n 1 is not affected by the bad motive of the actor.\n 2 THE COURT:  Okay.\n 3 MR. LOWELL:  These are not independent matters in this\n 4 case.  When you don't see something that feels like it fits the\n 5 traditional definition of \"cause,\" and I will in a minute\n 6 address the facts that you could come to to understand my\n 7 pretext issue, then they don't stand independently of each\n 8 other.\n 9 In other words, if all we have is a tweet and all of\n10 it says might, maybe, could, possibly, potentially, and there's\n11 no notice, there's no opportunity, it's all based on this\n12 litigation by tweet, then it becomes more important to see if\n13 the record contains that which illuminates that there was no\n14 cause.\n15 A bad motive can illuminate that there was no real\n16 cause to begin with.  Cause cannot overcome -- cause can\n17 overcome bad motive but bad motive can illuminate the fact that\n18 there was no cause.\n19 THE COURT:  That's helpful.  So when you say pretext,\n20 you're using it to say this evidence is further evidence that\n21 there was no cause.\n22 MR. LOWELL:  Correct.\n23 THE COURT:  Because we all can know what was happening\n24 here and that's just a bullet point under all of the reasons\n25 why there's no cause.  It's not as if you're asking me to dive\n\n    25\n 1 into the President's motivations to determine what the actual\n 2 reason was.\n 3 Why do I even need to look at that?  Couldn't I just\n 4 decide if I -- assuming it's reviewable, assuming there's the\n 5 standard that you've asked the Court to adopt is the standard,\n 6 don't I just look at that and make a decision?  Isn't it kind\n 7 of messy to then add the pretext point?\n 8 I understand, like for atmospherics I understand why\n 9 it would be done.  But in terms of my decision, do I really\n10 need to go to that point?\n11 MR. LOWELL:  The answer is more complicated than a yes\n12 or no.  So I'm going to give it a shorter than what I would\n13 normally do to answer your question as briefly as I can.\n14 The President's motive is -- let me answer your\n15 question directly.  If there is abundantly clear that there --\n16 whatever as I said to you five minutes ago, that there was no\n17 cause, that this can't be cause, I don't know what it is but I\n18 know what it's not.  So your ruling could be, you know, it's\n19 not.  You can't have Director Pulte's crazy midnight tweets be\n20 the same as cause.  Then, yeah, you don't have to get to motive\n21 in a way.\n22 On the other hand, because the President is asserting,\n23 as I understand the supplemental brief does, that he has wide\n24 discretion in these contexts and is going to say that you don't\n25 have to worry about the definition of what really cause is,\n\n    26\n 1 that's where you probably do have to address the atmospherics.\n 2 You say the word \"pretext.\"  We use the word\n 3 \"pretext.\"  Pretext is not an end to itself.  Pretext informs,\n 4 as I said before, the possibility that it shows that there was\n 5 no actual cause.\n 6 But the Court is right in that one sentence, that if\n 7 there is literally no chance, no permutation, no possible\n 8 mathematical formula in which what he did was cause, then maybe\n 9 you don't have to talk about the atmospherics.\n10 On the other hand, I don't know how the Court gets to\n11 that, given what happened in this case, without taking into\n12 consideration what happened even the day before Director Pulte\n13 went public on August 20th, on the 19th, when the President is\n14 still demanding that members of the Federal Reserve Board\n15 resign so that, quote, he can affect the interest rate.  \n16 You can't detach them in that fashion, although in a\n17 theoretical way the Court was right in that sense.  But I don't\n18 think in this case you can detach them.\n19 And in order to then further address your point about\n20 context and my point about how it informs cause or the lack of\n21 cause, let's just make sure we get this timeline right.\n22 Because if -- to put it another way, if there had been no\n23 demands by President Trump or Director Pulte to have Chairman\n24 Powell or Governor Barr or Governor Cook resign, so that the\n25 President, as he bragged on August the 26th at a cabinet\n\n    27\n 1 meeting, that he was now in a position to be able to, to use\n 2 his words, quote, have a majority on the Federal Reserve Board.\n 3 If there was none of that and on August the 20th the\n 4 President fired Governor Cook on the basis of a single social\n 5 media posting by the director that said maybe, could have,\n 6 seems, appears, possibly, had some effect before she was a\n 7 Governor, then I wouldn't be sitting here and saying that what\n 8 he said informs your decision on cause.  On the other hand, I\n 9 can't ignore what he said that gives ground to the idea that\n10 there was no cause.\n11 You see what I'm saying?  It could be but that's not\n12 what we have here.  So that's where if you go through that or\n13 if you give me the two minutes, I will remind and put on the\n14 record why that is important, but you can tell me if that's\n15 okay.\n16 THE COURT:  Sure.\n17 MR. LOWELL:  Let me do that.  Remember that this\n18 starts by somehow in April or May, which is not long before\n19 they take the actions they took -- and they're taking these\n20 actions in concert.  By that, I mean the President and his FHA\n21 director.\n22 They started seeking to pressure the Board to lower\n23 the interest rates.  And when the Board, which has decades of\n24 history of taking economic analysis into account before they\n25 make that decision, said they were doing that and they weren't\n\n    28\n 1 ready to make that decision, they immediately started to call\n 2 for the resignation of the chair.  That happened in June.  It\n 3 happened in July.  It even happened in August.\n 4 Governor Cook has stood fast with other members of the\n 5 Board, including Chairperson Powell, agreeing that it was not\n 6 ready for interest rate.  And miraculously, the President's ire\n 7 turned from Chairman Powell to Governor Cook.  Both those\n 8 individuals, when they were attacking Chairman Powell, what a\n 9 surprise, came up with an allegation of fraud.\n10 They said Chairman Powell had to resign because he was\n11 involved as the chair when there were renovations on the Fed\n12 building, and the Fed building renovations were riddled with,\n13 quote, fraud.  This allegation of fraud has become the weapon\n14 of choice in removing at least the people on the Board, let\n15 alone other officers in the country.\n16 In late July and early August, again, using the\n17 President's vehicles of social media, and more importantly his\n18 habit of calling people that he doesn't like nicknames, like\n19 children, started saying that Jay Powell was Jay \"Too Late\"\n20 Powell.  And he says that often in whatever he has posted and\n21 said at his press conferences.\n22 And then as I pointed out, Your Honor, not likely a\n23 coincidence that he did it again on August 19th, the day before\n24 Director Pulte took public aim at Governor Cook for the first\n25 time.  \n\n    29\n 1 And then Director Pulte, who's been at the center of\n 2 trying to create the atmospherics to create what he calls cause\n 3 for the President to act on, and is far from being an objective\n 4 arbiter of what really \"wrongdoing\" or what \"cause\" means, said\n 5 the following, that maybe, maybe this is a violation, and he's\n 6 put into words, therefore, taking the direction from the public\n 7 aspect of Jay Powell committing fraud in his public body doing\n 8 the renovations of a public building, which could, maybe, if\n 9 they were true, become his in-office for-cause conduct to move\n10 backwards in time to 20 years before when Governor Cook applied\n11 for her first mortgage.\n12 And so when you put in context the background, that's\n13 why, divorced from a definition that made any sense, the\n14 context and our allegation that it's pretextual comes into the\n15 Court's consideration of whether there was any cause to begin\n16 with.\n17 I will point out, although it's not in the record but\n18 it will certainly be true soon, since the President acted and\n19 we challenged it, this is also something the Court should take\n20 into consideration.  Not today, necessarily, but as we --\n21 Director Pulte has posted 31 different additional\n22 tweets to backfill his original referral, as if you say\n23 something and, oh, wait, that wasn't so good, and the President\n24 acts on your not so good, and she is alleged to have been fired\n25 on the 25th, that what he posted last night or this morning at\n\n    30\n 1 2 in the morning can somehow rectify the problem.\n 2 That's evidence, again, that there was never cause to\n 3 begin and it's just their efforts to get rid of governors, as\n 4 the President bragged on the cabinet, so that he could have,\n 5 quote, a majority.  So that's the context in which we are\n 6 asking the Court to consider this.\n 7 And then, as the cases say, and I know you already\n 8 said it back to me in one of your questions, what we know about\n 9 \"for cause\" is that it's not a policy dispute.  That's what the\n10 Supreme Court has said in various contexts in various cases.\n11 And what's interesting is what the President said on\n12 the 26th is bearing additional.  What he said was, if Governor\n13 Cook had done the right thing, then we would have a proper\n14 board.  And when said, what is proper, he said, not one that's\n15 honest, not one that is above board, not one that has never\n16 committed an infraction in their life, but he said, a Board\n17 that would lower the interest rates that I have demanded occur.\n18 When the President of the United States makes clear to\n19 the public that what it takes to be a for-cause is somebody who\n20 will do what he says so that he can have a majority and lower\n21 the interest rate, this Court knows, as everybody in this\n22 courtroom, everybody in America, that what he's saying, let's\n23 take him at his word.  \"For cause\" for the President means she\n24 won't go along with an interest rate drop and it's the context\n25 of all of those.\n\n    31\n 1 If you understand what he's trying to do, I don't mean\n 2 to be hyperbolic, but given what we have seen him and his\n 3 member of his administration say, almost any of them will make\n 4 a public social tweet allegation against somebody, saying that\n 5 before they took office or while they took office, and if\n 6 that's what it takes to both define \"cause,\" have the evidence,\n 7 have the opportunity for notice and opportunity, then we might\n 8 as well strike those provisions out of the Constitution.\n 9 And so that is why I'm asking the Court to consider\n10 how his conduct and his public statements basically prove the\n11 point that we're making.\n12 And the Court, in another context, in the TRW case in\n13 2001.  When we're trying, as you are asking me, to come up with\n14 a statutory construction, certainly repeated the old statutory\n15 construction law that says courts should not adopt an\n16 interpretation that, quote, in practical terms would render the\n17 phrase entirely superfluous.\n18 So that is a longer-winded answer to your question\n19 that was yes or no, but I do think, again, even if you don't\n20 use the word \"pretext,\" we now understand what \"for cause\"\n21 means in the context of the facts of this case.\n22 THE COURT:  Going back just to kind of put a finer\n23 point on \"cause,\" I understand the concerns and questions\n24 raised about acting on mere allegations and all kinds of\n25 circumstances.  So I understand that these are allegations and\n\n    32\n 1 there was a referral letter and there's no finding of any kind,\n 2 so I understand that.\n 3 Two questions.  One is, if this were a situation where\n 4 there was some admission of the underlying conduct -- I'm just\n 5 trying to pose a hypothetical where the conduct is not in\n 6 dispute, we're beyond allegations and everyone agrees that the\n 7 conduct at issue here happened.  Is that cause, or no, under\n 8 your formulation?\n 9 I understand your briefs to be saying that even if\n10 everything alleged is accurate, that still wouldn't be cause.\n11 And so I want you to explain that position.\n12 MR. LOWELL:  An admission of conduct is not an\n13 admission of the following factors.  A person's intentionality\n14 in the conduct.  The materiality to either the offense -- I say\n15 offense in quotes, not that it's a formal charge but the\n16 allegation of wrongdoing.\n17 THE COURT:  Let me stop you there.  I understand that.\n18 But those are the elements of criminal liability.\n19 MR. LOWELL:  Right.\n20 THE COURT:  So are you saying it has -- my\n21 hypothetical wasn't assuming criminal liability, even -- yes,\n22 my hypothetical is not necessarily assuming criminal liability,\n23 that you meet the mens rea requirements and the materiality\n24 requirements.\n25 I'm just saying in a case where there is -- there's\n\n    33\n 1 allegations of fraud and then there's cases -- well, I guess it\n 2 is.  If you're calling it fraud, I guess you have to\n 3 incorporate that.  Let me not call it fraud.\n 4 Let's say in this case there were what people now\n 5 understand to be misstatements on forms that don't rise to the\n 6 level of fraud or that a government body in its discretion\n 7 decides it's not going to pursue criminally, which --\n 8 MR. LOWELL:  Happens.\n 9 THE COURT:  People make that determination all the\n10 time, that for whatever reason they're not going to pursue the\n11 case.\n12 But assume that there are no criminal charges, no\n13 investigation, but otherwise the elements are met, that there\n14 were misstatements on forms, that they were knowing\n15 misstatements, that the person apologizes.  Is that cause?\n16 MR. LOWELL:  You're loading your question with words\n17 like \"knowing.\"  And as a lawyer, I can't accept the word\n18 without making sure we're on common ground.\n19 THE COURT:  I'm starting with \"knowing.\"  I'm starting\n20 with there's no criminal prosecution because the government, in\n21 its discretion for whatever reason, decides it's not going to\n22 pursue the case.\n23 This is not this case.  I'm taking you in a different\n24 case.  That there's a fraud that is -- everyone agrees it's\n25 fraud and there's no dispute that what the person did was\n\n    34\n 1 unlawful, despite the fact that they're not being prosecuted or\n 2 there are no legal findings to that effect.  Would that be for\n 3 cause?\n 4 MR. LOWELL:  Could be.  But as you said, that's hard\n 5 to take out of the context.  So let me answer it the way you\n 6 first asked it to me, if you'd let me do that.\n 7 You said an admission of conduct.  If a nominee who\n 8 gets in office fills out a form that they were required to go\n 9 get a loan or to fill out their financial disclosure form, and\n10 they are sitting there on their computer and it asks your\n11 income and they put in $10,000, because they made a\n12 typographical and it should have said a hundred thousand, and\n13 that person did that, then you have to find out whether that's\n14 an admission of conduct.\n15 The form says what the form says.  It says $10,000.\n16 It doesn't say 100,000.  Then you have to figure out why does\n17 it say 10,000 and not 100,000, which is why you asked and I\n18 asked you what you meant by \"knowing.\"  And therefore, you have\n19 to factor that in.\n20 Somebody could admit the conduct:  I put $10,000 on\n21 the form, I did that.  Then you have to ask the next question.\n22 Was it knowing?  Was it intentional?  Does it have any impact\n23 on what happened after that?  \n24 And that's why when we're in the hypothetical land, I\n25 can't just accept the premise that an admission of conduct is\n\n    35\n 1 enough to amount to cause without thinking about some of the\n 2 other terms.\n 3 And you even yourself asked me, well, what if\n 4 everybody agrees it was a violation but in prosecutorial\n 5 discretion all these cases are rarely ever pursued.  Those that\n 6 have intentional misstatements on an application to a bank\n 7 don't always get prosecuted as bank fraud.\n 8 But everybody admits that the person did it, that\n 9 there was some level of knowing, it was intentionality, could\n10 that be cause?  In that theoretical way, I suspect it could be\n11 cause.  But we don't have any of those facts in this case.\n12 THE COURT:  What about the statement in the letter\n13 along the lines of at minimum this shows a degree of\n14 carelessness that I think, in my judgment, doesn't make you\n15 suitable to remain in this position?\n16 Can you respond to that directly?\n17 MR. LOWELL:  I can.  If I was disbarred or you were\n18 impeached because in one of our opinions we made a mistake that\n19 was not intentional but is what happens when human beings serve\n20 in the positions we are given, and that becomes cause for\n21 those, then that's a threshold that I don't think we can ever\n22 live up to.  That would be way too severe.\n23 But the problem with, again, that question back to me,\n24 is that this is not yet and this is the point.  There's no\n25 basis to conclude that Governor Cook did anything that would\n\n    36\n 1 amount to what is being asked of me in the hypothetical.\n 2 For example, no one's asked, did she have an\n 3 accountant that told her whatever it is that Pulte is accusing\n 4 her of was the right way to do it?  Is there a lawyer involved\n 5 in the process?  \n 6 That's the kind of development of when a person is\n 7 supposed to be given an opportunity to be heard.  That creates\n 8 a record on which a President can take action for cause.  \n 9 So in your question to me, you're right.  If you and I\n10 can construct a hypothetical, everybody agrees on the conduct,\n11 everybody agrees on the knowing, everybody agrees on the\n12 intentionality, everybody agrees on the materiality, everybody\n13 agrees on its seriousness but no prosecution occurred, can that\n14 be for cause?\n15 Yes.  That can be for cause, given what it is,\n16 depending if it's, I don't know, something that deals with the\n17 person's economy as opposed to whether or not somebody lied\n18 about having a nonprescription drug that they shouldn't have\n19 had.\n20 That depends as well.\n21 But in your construct and my response to you, that's\n22 the factors that would have to be considered.\n23 THE COURT:  Okay.  I think that takes us to -- I have\n24 a few questions about the due process argument.  My\n25 understanding is that this statute does not lay out any\n\n    37\n 1 specific procedural requirements in connection with removal.\n 2 We're all on the same page there?\n 3 MR. LOWELL:  The statute itself --\n 4 THE COURT:  Yeah.  I mean, there's no scheme here.\n 5 The statute doesn't outline what notice and opportunity to be\n 6 heard has to look like in the context of removing someone.\n 7 MR. LOWELL:  Not itself but the statute does talk\n 8 about the need for a notice and an opportunity to be heard as\n 9 creating that right, and then you refer to what does that mean\n10 in other contexts, like the Loudermill case, and I never --\n11 THE COURT:  What part of the statute are you -- you\n12 said the statute talks about notice and opportunity?\n13 MR. LOWELL:  The Federal Reserve Act itself creates --\n14 give me one second.\n15 THE COURT:  Sure.\n16 MR. LOWELL:  With your indulgence.\n17 THE COURT:  Sure.\n18 MR. LOWELL:  I misspoke in the sense that the statute,\n19 you're right, doesn't say it, but the statute does create the\n20 right, the property right.  And then you look to the cases\n21 which interpret the property right to determine what that\n22 means.\n23 THE COURT:  Okay.  So this might be a case where\n24 you're saying she got absolutely no procedure, so I might not\n25 need to get into all of this.  But what would those procedures\n\n    38\n 1 at minimum look like from your perspective?\n 2 MR. LOWELL:  Reference to when -- let's do the\n 3 building block of how you get to notice.  What's adequate\n 4 notice and opportunity to be heard?  First, you have to decide\n 5 whether or not there is a right that gives you that.  And we, I\n 6 think, are beyond the right.  \n 7 All the cases point out that a for-cause candidate in\n 8 this kind of a term, that is a property right.  So when you do\n 9 that, then you turn to what are the cases that interpret what\n10 that is.\n11 And then you look to Loudermill or Esparraguerra and\n12 it says things like, an oral or written notice of charges, an\n13 explanation of the evidence supporting it and an opportunity to\n14 present her side of the story, are the words of those two\n15 D.C. -- the more recent D.C. Circuit referring to an earlier\n16 Supreme Court, and the important phrase that that has to be\n17 given to somebody, quote, prior, end quote, to the discharge.\n18 There is a body of law that would define what proper\n19 notice and hearing is.  And even the Reagan case that the Court\n20 is aware of in the 1901 Supreme Court mirrors that the Supreme\n21 Court stated that for-cause protection means in statutes some\n22 basis of notice and hearing are, quote, to use the terms of the\n23 Supreme Court, essential.\n24 Now, I don't have the ability in all of the cases that\n25 you and I might talk about when we submit, or what we've\n\n    39\n 1 already submitted, to say more than what, again, it isn't.  If\n 2 it's supposed to be an oral or written notice of the charges,\n 3 and we have Director Pulte saying, you know, maybe, it seems,\n 4 it could have been, it appears, it was a potentiality.  \n 5 Okay, that's not much.  But let's say that was the\n 6 notice of the charges, and it says possible mortgage fraud.\n 7 Well, again, what was the mortgage fraud?  Was it a possibility\n 8 that when she applied to the mortgage and she was moving. from\n 9 one primary residence to a second primary residence there was\n10 an overlap when both of them were called primary residence\n11 because she teaches at Harvard or she teaches in Massachusetts\n12 or she teaches in Michigan?\n13 That's not clear.  That's not notice of the charges.\n14 And if you're asking for an explanation of the evidence, I\n15 don't know what that phrase means but it certainly doesn't mean\n16 Director Pulte's in-the-middle-of-the-night allegations of the\n17 possibility of anything.\n18 And then an opportunity to present her side of the\n19 story has never been given.  And even in that last 31 tweets\n20 over the last 36 hours, I know one thing.  I know that\n21 opportunity to be heard and to tell your side of the story is\n22 not for me to finally sign up after all these years to a social\n23 media account so that I can rebut his charges in the same\n24 ethernet that he's making them.\n25 THE COURT:  This is raised in the government's\n\n    40\n 1 opposition, so you'll respond in writing, but just even before\n 2 the government's opposition I was trying to figure out the\n 3 cases deal with employees.  Is it your position that Governor\n 4 Cook is analogous to employees?\n 5 MR. LOWELL:  For purposes of what the due process\n 6 clause gives her?\n 7 THE COURT:  Yes.  For purposes of whether she has a\n 8 property right.  And the government, in its opposition, which\n 9 you'll respond to, indicates that she's a public official.\n10 I'll have some questions for them about this because I think\n11 the case deals with an elected official and I see a strong\n12 reason why an elected official wouldn't have a property right\n13 in his or her position.  \n14 But then that asks the question -- this is a kind of\n15 unique position.  It's not quite an employee.  It's not an\n16 elected official.  It isn't a government official.  And so -- \n17 MR. LOWELL:  There are cases that you pointed out to.\n18 One that comes to mind -- let's set the framework.  So you have\n19 me, an American citizen who somebody is taking action against,\n20 and what is the notice and opportunity that I get under the due\n21 process clause.\n22 Then you have somebody that is at a position more\n23 official than I, and that can be, if you will, the elected\n24 official.  Then you have a person to the side, which is an\n25 appointed official.\n\n    41\n 1 What we know is people in Governor Cook's position is\n 2 not some sort of officer -- doesn't get less due process.  In\n 3 fact, because her position as a Presidentially-appointed,\n 4 Senate-confirmed set of terms of a 14-year term has absolutely\n 5 been deemed to be giving somebody in that position with a\n 6 for-cause exclusion -- only way of being taken out of office,\n 7 that has been held to be a property right.\n 8 And as to it being an officer, one of the cases will\n 9 respond and admit to is the Shurtleff case, where an individual\n10 was an officer.  So I haven't seen how they articulate their\n11 position yet.\n12 THE COURT:  What kind of officer?  Remind me in that\n13 case.\n14 MR. LOWELL:  Again, with the Court's indulgence.\n15 THE COURT:  Okay.\n16 MR. LOWELL:  I think it was the general appraiser of\n17 the context of the agency.  But again, we will address that in\n18 specific.\n19 THE COURT:  Would that person have had a statutory\n20 process prescribed?\n21 MR. LOWELL:  I will address that.  I can't answer\n22 that.  The case is just being brought to my attention.\n23 THE COURT:  I think here's what's interesting about\n24 this question and why I started asking what the process looks\n25 like.  Because there's no -- we can talk about what the minimum\n\n    42\n 1 requirements are, but in terms of an opportunity to explain her\n 2 side, that would be to the President and the decision maker.\n 3 Because there's some veins of due process cases that\n 4 suggest that due process requires an independent decision maker\n 5 from the person who makes the decision.  And I don't think we\n 6 would say that maps here, right?\n 7 MR. LOWELL:  Right.  That one is easy, right.\n 8 THE COURT:  So it would be just the opportunity to\n 9 explain -- I guess baked into that, if someone has a\n10 due-process right, I have to assume good-faith reception from\n11 the person getting the explanation.  Otherwise, it's not a\n12 meaningful process.\n13 But you're not suggesting anything more than notice\n14 and a clear explanation of the allegations, charges, however\n15 you want to frame them, against them and an opportunity to\n16 rebut and contest the explanations or otherwise explain them\n17 before the decision is made.\n18 MR. LOWELL:  Right.\n19 THE COURT:  And you're not suggesting that there's any\n20 other requirements that the statute would require me to map on\n21 to that basic minimum framework.\n22 MR. LOWELL:  What Your Honor just said is correct.\n23 And we can then put it into the context of this case.  Because\n24 we could be here -- I would be at your podium depending on what\n25 happens in my answer to your question.\n\n    43\n 1 So let's say that the allegation against Governor Cook\n 2 was made and let's say it was made -- President acted on the\n 3 allegation but he didn't decide that on his own.  He based it\n 4 on an allegation made by one of the people in his\n 5 administration, in this case the FHA director Bill Pulte.  \n 6 Bill Pulte writes that he thinks Governor Cook did\n 7 something wrong.  It is in front of that person that we get the\n 8 opportunity of notice and the opportunity to be heard --\n 9 THE COURT:  In front of the --\n10 MR. LOWELL:  Before the President acts, if it is an\n11 agency that's implementing his action, then there's -- I don't\n12 pretend that I was going to walk into the Oval Office and make\n13 a 20-minute presentation to President Trump and say, by the\n14 way, Pulte is wrong.  Maybe that is what could happen.\n15 I certainly know that to give any meaning to notice\n16 and opportunity to be heard, there has to be that place\n17 somewhere.  So where is it?  President acts on the basis of\n18 what Pulte said.  Pulte says it on the basis of who knows what.\n19 Maybe it's at that who-knows-what basis that we get the notice\n20 and opportunity to be heard, but it certainly has to be\n21 somewhere between him carrying it out and the allegation being\n22 made.  It could have been at that point.  \n23 And the point I was going to make is let's say we have\n24 that opportunity, and Director Pulte says, yeah, I made the\n25 charge of mortgage fraud.  You gave it your best shot.  You\n\n    44\n 1 told us that it was advised by an accountant, there was a\n 2 lawyer involved, it's not intentional, there's no materiality,\n 3 there was no financial gain to her.  I'm using the\n 4 hypothetical.\n 5 And then he says, I think it's anyway, and the\n 6 President acts on that.  Then I might be in front of you and\n 7 saying, on the basis of this record, it's like an APA claim.\n 8 It was an arbitrary and capricious decision by an agency\n 9 carrying out an improper motive of the President, but we're not\n10 there.  \n11 And that's the problem with these hypotheticals.\n12 Because what I do know is that nothing that's happened could\n13 satisfy any court's requirement that there was proper notice\n14 and an opportunity --\n15 THE COURT:  So what you're suggesting is even if\n16 minimum procedural requirements that satisfy constitutional\n17 standards are met, there could be a challenge to a decision at\n18 that point?\n19 MR. LOWELL:  No.  I think -- no, because --\n20 THE COURT:  I guess yes, because you have a separate\n21 claim that this didn't rise to cause.  This is not sufficient\n22 cause.  So --\n23 MR. LOWELL:  That's difficult and you and I are both\n24 squinting because it is difficult.\n25 If the President acts on his definition of cause, that\n\n    45\n 1 I, the President, have said this is cause, you certainly have\n 2 the opportunity to see what the \"this\" is in the sentence.\n 3 If the \"this\" in the sentence is what Pulte says,\n 4 which is what we have now, and we know that doesn't satisfy, I\n 5 can't sit here and give you the five elements of what Pulte\n 6 could have done better for which I would concede, okay, that's\n 7 cause.\n 8 But I can say there is room for that without my\n 9 saying -- because, again, it's not a criminal case.  It's not a\n10 disciplinary action in front of the Bar or in front of the\n11 judicial conference.  So I can't answer your question because\n12 that one is way into the hypothetical land.\n13 I can say, though, that if there's notice and an\n14 opportunity to be heard, the Court would be equipped to decide\n15 whether it conforms to the case law and what that means.\n16 And I can't answer today where that would be.  As I\n17 said, I'm not trying to be flip, but I don't think it's me\n18 making a presentation in the Oval, but I know it has to be\n19 somewhere.\n20 THE COURT:  If we could finally talk about irreparable\n21 harm, just because I personally think the cases are all over\n22 the place here in this context.  There is authority suggesting\n23 that kind of the right to continue in a statutorily-prescribed\n24 position is not irreparable.  So if you could outline very\n25 clearly what the irreparable harm is.\n\n    46\n 1 MR. LOWELL:  We did that a bit and we will address it\n 2 to the extent that they challenge our having done that a bit.\n 3 We think the case law is not that ambiguous, that a person\n 4 appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate -- and\n 5 again, you can't detach this from the unique role that the\n 6 Federal Reserve plays.\n 7 THE COURT:  Right.\n 8 MR. LOWELL:  I don't know whether the irreparable harm\n 9 is the same in one of the cases in which it's an inferior\n10 officer who has been taken out of that person's job for things\n11 that we believe not to have been proper basis.  And I'll come\n12 back to that in just a second as to the special place that the\n13 Federal Reserve -- and therefore, a special place that the\n14 federal governors play in the system, in which you're asking\n15 what is notice, what is opportunity to be heard and, now, what\n16 is irreparable harm.\n17 But a Presidential appointee in a historic agency that\n18 every entity indicates has a special place in the constellation\n19 of the United States government informs whether or not removing\n20 that person, who took an oath and said I hereby will defend and\n21 uphold the Constitution of the United States, and then for a\n22 Governor even more than that, says I will make sure that we\n23 perform the job of Governors independently as we were charted\n24 to do back from the time that the central bank of the United\n25 States was formed, and you are taking away from me my ability\n\n    47\n 1 to do that.  \n 2 It's not about the salary, as in those cases.  It's\n 3 not a monetary damage issue.  You've taken my right away to do\n 4 my job, and my job is confirmed by the Senate and it is sworn\n 5 to that I do it.  And I think the cases we already cited\n 6 indicate that that is irreparable harm.  And to the extent the\n 7 government's brief indicates that we're not right, that will be\n 8 something that -- \n 9 THE COURT:  You're saying that's just -- that sounds\n10 like an argument that I can't perform my statutory functions.\n11 Which I understood cases -- I'm trying to think the state of\n12 play in recent Circuit and Supreme Court decisions, that there\n13 was some suggestion that that type of argument is not\n14 irreparable harm, the inability of the person to carry out\n15 statutorily-mandated functions.\n16 Are you saying that -- it is true that none of those\n17 cases involved this body.  So are you saying that those are\n18 distinguishable by nature of the unique functions of this\n19 Board, and, if so, if you could just explain that and spin that\n20 out a little more.\n21 MR. LOWELL:  We will do that but I'll look at the\n22 Albert versus Employment Benefits case of the D.C. Circuit, an\n23 integral part of the federal government.  The Board conducts\n24 the monetary policy, regulates institutions, maintains the\n25 stability.\n\n    48\n 1 Governor Cook, along with her brothers and sisters,\n 2 agreed that that was the charge that they accepted to do that\n 3 created in her being a Governor that was confirmed and has only\n 4 a for-cause removal, a property right.  \n 5 If she is not allowed to pursue what she was given the\n 6 statutory and Senate-confirmed reason to do, and she's being\n 7 able -- and being taken it away, we believe that that now is in\n 8 the area in which that does equal irreparable harm.\n 9 And we will, again, further address it because I\n10 haven't seen the way that they have attacked that issue.\n11 THE COURT:  You also reference the fact that you say\n12 that the executive -- the President is having discussions about\n13 a replacement, and that that is irreparable -- your point there\n14 is that if a replacement is put on and there's nothing that --\n15 MR. LOWELL:  Well, that gets us into -- and there has\n16 been case law now -- as to whether reinstatement, for example.\n17 But how do you do that -- now, again, I don't know how this all\n18 works at the speed of light.\n19 The President has already announced a number of\n20 candidates that he has in mind.  The President has stated as\n21 recently as three days ago -- today's the 29th, three days ago,\n22 that he will now have a majority of the Board.  \n23 The Senate of the United States, under the present\n24 administration -- how should I say this -- has not necessarily\n25 been stellar in its advise and consent role.  So theoretically,\n\n    49\n 1 that could end up being something that he nominates and says\n 2 the vacancy exists.  There's an opening.  I now nominate John\n 3 Doe.  The Senate takes it up next week.  The Senate decides to\n 4 confirm or the President says it's there.\n 5 That is irreparable harm and that hypothetical isn't\n 6 so hypothetical in the world we live in these days.  He's\n 7 already said that.  He's already said he wants a majority.\n 8 He's bragged that he's going to get it.  And he has nominees,\n 9 and I think that would qualify for sure under the factual\n10 circumstances of this matter as we are appearing in front of\n11 you.\n12 THE COURT:  And is it also your argument in terms of\n13 irreparable harm that deprivation of the due-process rights are\n14 irreparable?  That that --\n15 MR. LOWELL:  They are in the context of, then, before\n16 we get a chance to say, wait, don't do it, she's already out of\n17 office and kicked out of the building and doesn't have the\n18 ability to function.  Then those overlap in terms of that\n19 function.\n20 THE COURT:  Is there any authority -- and if you don't\n21 have it now, I would be interested to see it in your reply --\n22 where a person was fired or removed in violation of due process\n23 requirements, and the relief was interim restatement to receive\n24 potentially more process?\n25 MR. LOWELL:  I have to look at what Judge Ali ruled in\n\n    50\n 1 the NCUI case.  Because the issue there was, for example, was\n 2 reinstatement with whatever.  And I think the issue was not\n 3 just, okay, you get back pay.  Back pay wasn't enough, et\n 4 cetera.  So I will look at that.  We will address that as well\n 5 in our supplement.  So we will do that as well.\n 6 THE COURT:  Okay.  And if you were -- if I were to\n 7 grant some sort of preliminary relief, can we just confirm that\n 8 we're on the same page about what you're saying the remedy is?\n 9 You're agreeing -- and that's why you've sued the Federal\n10 Reserve -- or named the Federal Reserve and its chair, because\n11 any injunctive relief, you're acknowledging, could not be\n12 directed to the President; is that correct?\n13 MR. LOWELL:  We've acknowledged that -- and it's been\n14 interesting, in the last two days I've been looking at the law\n15 about why it's always assumed that you can't enjoin the\n16 President from being unconstitutional.\n17 And I know that there's some academic and scholarly\n18 works out there, but for the purposes of this case, we don't\n19 have to decide that.  We have to decide that -- this is the\n20 famous, Judge.  If a tree falls in the forest and there's\n21 nobody there, does it make a noise?  \n22 If the President was sitting around and saying, I\n23 think Governor Cook is fired and nobody took any action against\n24 it, then I might not have to be here.  But given that the Fed\n25 is saying we are an uncertain terms, that's very trepidatious.\n\n    51\n 1 Who knows what they'll do tomorrow and the next day.  \n 2 So consequently, we do believe that what you just said\n 3 creates the need for the relief.  And the relief, for purposes\n 4 of the preliminary place we're at, is that at least for now we\n 5 have shown likelihood of success on the merits, either because,\n 6 whatever it means, \"for cause\" can't be this.  And whatever\n 7 \"notice\" and \"opportunity\" means, it can't be this.  So we then\n 8 only need for now a likelihood of success on those in order to\n 9 meet that criterion of preliminary relief.\n10 We've addressed the issue of whether or not there's\n11 irreparable harm, and we believe that there is.\n12 THE COURT:  Can we talk a little bit more about that.\n13 Because I'm thinking specifically of the D.C. Circuit's stay\n14 decision in the Dellinger case, where it said, even assuming\n15 the removal was unlawful and even assuming that that creates a\n16 cognizable injury, that's not an irreparable injury.\n17 MR. LOWELL:  But again, I have to remember that in the\n18 Dellinger case we're talking, again, about that other criteria,\n19 single director, Board staggered, term, special circumstance of\n20 what a Governor does.\n21 THE COURT:  I understand that.  And I understand that\n22 specifically in my consideration of the balance of the\n23 equities.  But why is that relevant for irreparable harm, the\n24 nature of the entity?\n25 MR. LOWELL:  I think for three reasons.  One, I think\n\n    52\n 1 irreparable harm also depends on what is the property right.\n 2 And if there's a property right as well, then the question\n 3 becomes what is being -- what is she being deprived of?  \n 4 And if what she's being deprived of is more than\n 5 simply I want my paycheck, but I want the ability to satisfy\n 6 the oath I took, the statutory right I was given not to be\n 7 removed for anything but cause, that I have also committed\n 8 myself to the independence of the Federal Reserve Board, all\n 9 those will stack up to amount to irreparable harm, and we'll\n10 address Dellinger as well when we do that.\n11 THE COURT:  Okay.\n12 MR. LOWELL:  So back to your question.  Then if we got\n13 to that piece, at least for now until we flesh out these and\n14 some of the other questions, then what we need to do is\n15 basically to tell everybody that the status quo stays in place.\n16 That's the relief we're asking this Court to do.\n17 She should not be taken out of her office.  She\n18 shouldn't be disconnected to her electronics.  She should be\n19 able to participate in the meetings.  She should do all the\n20 things that she did a week ago before all this started because\n21 that is the status quo ante.\n22 That's the relief we're asking this Court, at least at\n23 the TRO or at the preliminary level.  If that's what you asking\n24 me as to what is the relief we're asking for, that's the relief\n25 we're asking for.\n\n    53\n 1 THE COURT:  Okay.\n 2 MR. LOWELL:  I know you have questions.  You'll\n 3 probably get me allowed to stand up again when the government\n 4 is done.\n 5 THE COURT:  Yes.\n 6 MR. LOWELL:  I think I would like to just -- because\n 7 so many of the things you asked does reflect on the unique\n 8 position that the Federal Reserve and its Governors play, I\n 9 could not be more struck by the irony of what I was able to\n10 glance -- and I want to point out just glance because it\n11 deserves more than a glance -- the brief filed by the\n12 government before I had a chance to read all 30-some-odd pages\n13 this morning and what it says about the President's power.  \n14 What it says about the President's power that now they\n15 want to apply to the Federal Reserve.  What they say the\n16 President's power is to apply to the Federal Reserve,\n17 notwithstanding the many years of Humphrey's Executor and\n18 Wilcox and others.\n19 But what struck me, Your Honor, was they made that\n20 filing today.  And I couldn't help but notice that filing of\n21 30 pages, among others, is signed by my brother, Mr. Roth, who\n22 now says that position.  So when he gets up, maybe he'll\n23 address why in the brief he filed in the Harris versus Bessent\n24 case, he put his signature on the following quote.\n25 The early Congresses further provided that the banks\n\n    54\n 1 of the United States, like the Federal Reserve, would have a\n 2 degree of insulation from the President's control.  Congress\n 3 provided that all -- emphasis added -- all of the first bank's\n 4 directors and 80 percent of the second bank's directors would\n 5 not be subject to Presidential removal; emphasis at all.\n 6 While the Federal Reserve Governors may be removed by\n 7 the President only for cause, the Federal Reserve Act, quote,\n 8 the banks of the United States and their successors in the\n 9 Federal Reserve represent, quote -- well, this is all a\n10 quote -- sub-quote, a unique institution with unique history\n11 and background.  Its historical pedigree cannot be general\n12 extrapolated to other federal entities or agents.\n13 That was just three months ago.  And now I read that\n14 part in his brief today.  He signed both but he's changed his\n15 view.\n16 Thank you for your time.\n17 THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  I'll hear from\n18 government.\n19 MR. ROTH:  Good morning, Your Honor.\n20 THE COURT:  Good morning.\n21 MR. ROTH:  I'm happy to just proceed unless Your Honor\n22 has questions you want to start with.\n23 THE COURT:  I have questions.  So with respect to\n24 cause, I understand the government's acknowledged that cause\n25 should be -- it's limited -- it can't be a policy disagreement.\n\n    55\n 1 MR. ROTH:  Correct.\n 2 THE COURT:  So beyond that it could be any reason\n 3 that's articulated?\n 4 MR. ROTH:  Yes.\n 5 THE COURT:  Okay.  What if -- would a policy\n 6 disagreement cover if a president said there are members of the\n 7 board who are refusing to look at all of this data suggesting\n 8 there's no inflation and there's no reason to keep interest\n 9 rates at the current level, and I'm concerned that they're only\n10 taking these positions to make my administration look bad and\n11 they're not faithfully discharging their duties to at least\n12 consider this other evidence and whatever.  And so I don't\n13 think that they have the intellectual ability or the judgment\n14 to remain.  Is that a political disagreement or is that\n15 something else?\n16 MR. ROTH:  Still sounds like a policy decision to me.\n17 THE COURT:  All right.  So anything that relates to\n18 firing based on a position that the officer takes is off\n19 limits?\n20 MR. ROTH:  I don't know if I would go quite that far.\n21 I mean, you can imagine some extreme case where someone\n22 exercises their power in an abusive way, and that's sort of\n23 beyond the pale and is treated as cause.\n24 But I think if you're within the realm of reasonable\n25 policy disputes, the Supreme Court has told us that's not cause\n\n    56\n 1 for purposes of these statutes and we're not disputing that\n 2 here.\n 3 THE COURT:  Given the specific information that\n 4 plaintiff's counsel just made about the unique nature of this\n 5 Board and the need for independence, does it make sense that\n 6 there would be such broad discretion?\n 7 MR. ROTH:  Yeah, I mean, just to go back to what\n 8 counsel was saying at the end, I don't understand what the\n 9 contradiction is.  We've said in many other cases, including\n10 the one that he cites, that, generally speaking, Congress does\n11 not have the authority to restrict Presidential removal of\n12 executive officers.\n13 And we've always carved out in our briefs in --\n14 Federal Reserve, and said Federal Reserve might be different\n15 because it has a unique historical background.  \n16 And that's why in this removal letter the President\n17 did not say, like he has in other removals, You are removed\n18 pursuant to Article 2, period.  He have said, You are removed\n19 for cause and here's why.  So he is invoking the statutory\n20 for-cause removal provision, and our position is he has\n21 satisfied that provision, not that that provision is\n22 unconstitutional.\n23 The reason for that difference relates to the unique\n24 historical features of the Federal Reserve.  And that is why\n25 there is a -- we're not at this point saying no limits\n\n    57\n 1 whatsoever.\n 2 The limit is that it can't be just, well, I want my\n 3 people there or I don't like the way you are -- as a policy\n 4 matter, the way you're exercising your duties.  That's what the\n 5 Supreme Court said in Wiener and Humphrey's Executor that\n 6 \"cause\" means.  But beyond that, the statute doesn't provide\n 7 any further description.\n 8 And Reagan does say when the statute just says \"cause\"\n 9 or \"causes\" without further specification, that means it's\n10 discretionary and it's not reviewable by the Court.\n11 THE COURT:  It can really be for any -- the most de\n12 minimis reason one could think of that's unrelated to policy\n13 decisions?  It could really just be any reason at all?\n14 MR. ROTH:  Your Honor, maybe I want to separate sort\n15 of the reviewability question from the sort of, like, what does\n16 the statute mean.\n17 THE COURT:  Okay.\n18 MR. ROTH:  The statute means a reason that calls into\n19 question the individual's fitness or ability to serve.\n20 THE COURT:  Okay.\n21 MR. ROTH:  And then it's the President's determination\n22 as to whether that standard has been satisfied.  And I think\n23 under Reagan, there isn't supposed to be review of that\n24 determination.  Certainly, to the extent there is review, it's\n25 going to be very deferential review.  \n\n    58\n 1 And I was sort of struck by counsel's statements about\n 2 how, look, it's a sliding scale.  And there's so many factors,\n 3 there's so many variables.  The type of conduct, its\n 4 relationship to the office, how serious it is, when it\n 5 happened, all of these things have to be taken into account.  \n 6 Well, that sounds to me like the epitome of a\n 7 discretionary determination and that's when the President's\n 8 power is at its apex, in making those judgment calls and\n 9 weighing those variables.\n10 THE COURT:  What is reviewable in this context?\n11 Certainly someone could say I was fired without cause and that\n12 would be something that a court could review?\n13 MR. ROTH:  I think what would be reviewable is if the\n14 President did not give a cause, then somebody could say, hey,\n15 I'm entitled to cause, and that hasn't been satisfied because\n16 he didn't give a cause.\n17 Once you have the cause, I think the only question\n18 really under the cases is is it just a mere policy disagreement\n19 that is out of bounds.\n20 THE COURT:  And is that reviewable?\n21 MR. ROTH:  I think it's what the statute means.  I\n22 don't think it's reviewable under Reagan but I think it's what\n23 the statute means.\n24 THE COURT:  But if there was a violation of that,\n25 there's no recourse for someone?\n\n    59\n 1 MR. ROTH:  That's how I read Reagan, but I'll be quick\n 2 to add that to the extent the Court thinks there's room for\n 3 judicial review, that would be what would be the most obvious\n 4 situation for judicial review.\n 5 THE COURT:  I think plaintiff's counsel could tell I'm\n 6 uncomfortable with the pretext argument, but I also am\n 7 uncomfortable with an idea that could someone explicitly say I\n 8 want to get a majority on the board, so let's go dig in and\n 9 find reasons to kick all these people off so I can get my\n10 people in.\n11 MR. ROTH:  Right.\n12 THE COURT:  And then the letter says, this is the\n13 reason.\n14 MR. ROTH:  Right.  The Supreme Court decisions say, we\n15 look at the President's determination and the rationale he has\n16 given.  They're very, very reluctant to allow courts to probe\n17 that or probe the sincerity of that.  That's Trump versus\n18 Hawaii but it also goes back to Nixon.  \n19 And Your Honor's questions about, like, well, how are\n20 we going to tell?  We need to depose the President and say did\n21 he really mean it?  No.  I mean, the courts don't do that.  And\n22 so it's kind of a dead end in that way, and I think that is why\n23 we are stuck with a determination the President made on its\n24 face.\n25 Now, I will add that in addition to being legally\n\n    60\n 1 foreclosed, I don't think this is a particularly strong pretext\n 2 argument.  There is -- until this referral came out, I'm not\n 3 aware of any statements the President ever made about Dr. Cook.\n 4 They say, well, he tried to get Chairman Powell to resign.\n 5 Okay, but this isn't Chairman Powell.  This is Dr. Cook.  And\n 6 the referral came about her.  That's when this arose.\n 7 There's nothing in the President's statements, either\n 8 contemporaneous or after, that suggests that the removal was\n 9 for any reason other than the reason given in the letter.\n10 Now, maybe he's happy to have an opening that he can\n11 fill, but that's different from the question of what was the\n12 reason and the basis for the removal.\n13 THE COURT:  My question was -- let's put it purely\n14 hypothetical, because I don't want to suggest or have you\n15 acknowledge that this might have happened here.  \n16 But in a case where there are explicit statements of a\n17 desire to remove members who have policy disagreements, can I\n18 look to those?  Or you're saying no?\n19 MR. ROTH:  The way I read Trump versus Hawaii is there\n20 is, at minimum, extreme reluctance to go down that path.  I\n21 don't want to make categorical statements, never, no\n22 hypothetical.  But generally speaking, the rule is we look at\n23 what the President has said and we evaluate it on its own\n24 terms.\n25 And that's the presumption of good faith that the\n\n    61\n 1 Supreme Court has reiterated over and over again in this\n 2 context.\n 3 I'll also just say while we're talking about the cause\n 4 and the referral, counsel said repeatedly, oh, it's just a\n 5 maybe, we don't know, it's allegations.  That's not really\n 6 what's going on.\n 7 The referral letter attaches the documents.  It's not\n 8 like, oh, maybe something happened.  They're right there.  I\n 9 looked at them.  They have the signature.  They make\n10 contradictory representations.  They're within two weeks of\n11 each other.\n12 Now, maybe there's an explanation that that goes to\n13 certainly criminal liability.  Maybe she didn't read it.  Maybe\n14 her lawyer told her it was fine.  I don't know.  They haven't\n15 said any of that.  \n16 They've been very careful in this brief not to make\n17 any representations about what actually happened, any defense,\n18 any articulation of what the explanation is for what, on its\n19 face, is a contradictory representation about the intent to use\n20 and occupy two properties as principal residence at the same\n21 time.\n22 THE COURT:  What if a stated cause is demonstrably\n23 false?  That's still not anything that anyone can do anything\n24 about?\n25 MR. ROTH:  I'm glad we don't have that case, Your\n\n    62\n 1 Honor.  It's a difficult situation.  I acknowledge it's a\n 2 difficult hypothetical.  And that's the thing about\n 3 non-reviewability rules is they allow for hypotheticals that\n 4 are uncomfortable.\n 5 But again, to the extent that we're going to have\n 6 judicial review at all, it's going to be a deferential form of\n 7 review where we're looking at the material and saying is this\n 8 an extreme abuse of discretion or is this within the range.\n 9 And I just don't see the argument that for a very\n10 senior financial regulatory official, making contradictory\n11 representations on financial documents with no explanation\n12 given -- and again, we're now a week later.  We have filings,\n13 still no explanation given.  That that's not a reasonable\n14 ground to say a person -- that there's cause for removal?  I\n15 just don't see it.\n16 THE COURT:  I read your brief and I had a strong\n17 reaction to the suggestion that there was notice and an\n18 opportunity here because of the social media post, and that she\n19 didn't respond to it and so that in five days the President\n20 acted.\n21 We'll go back to your argument that this is not a\n22 protected property interest.  But if it was, I mean, you're not\n23 suggesting that what happened here would satisfy due process\n24 requirements?\n25 MR. ROTH:  Oh, yeah, no, I absolutely am.  And we can\n\n    63\n 1 look at it step by step.\n 2 Notice of the concern was given on August 20th.\n 3 THE COURT:  That's the social media post?\n 4 MR. ROTH:  It's a -- yes.\n 5 THE COURT:  Was anything sent to her directly?\n 6 MR. ROTH:  Well, she certainly knew about it because\n 7 she was asked about it.\n 8 THE COURT:  I'm not necessarily equating this to a\n 9 civil case but you still have to serve someone.  You have to\n10 give them information.\n11 MR. ROTH:  But if there's actual notice, Your Honor,\n12 that generally satisfies.\n13 THE COURT:  So actual notice.  And then in terms of --\n14 how did she know that she had five days to respond?\n15 MR. ROTH:  She didn't know she had five days, Your\n16 Honor.  But the President certainly made clear in that initial\n17 statement that he considers this as potential grounds for\n18 removal.\n19 And there was, at least as far as the record appears,\n20 no response, no intent, no letter saying, hey, I disagree with\n21 this, give me a chance to tell you why.  No statement of, this\n22 is false, I never signed this, or the President is wrong\n23 because my lawyer told me this was allowed.  Nothing.\n24 No communication at all to the President from a\n25 principal officer of the United States over this period of\n\n    64\n 1 time.  And, again, still today we don't know.\n 2 THE COURT:  Again, this is why I was asking\n 3 plaintiff's counsel what the procedures would look like.  But\n 4 at minimum, when you -- when someone has an opportunity to be\n 5 heard, don't they have to be given information about what their\n 6 rights and obligations are with respect to that?\n 7 MR. ROTH:  Well, Your Honor, I think part of the\n 8 problem of importing this framework into this context is that\n 9 it doesn't map on very well because a lot of these concepts\n10 are -- they're built around sort of civil service statutes that\n11 give precise procedures and rights and remedies.\n12 And none of that applies when we're talking about a\n13 senior level principal officer, and that's why no case has held\n14 that those protections apply to principal officers of the\n15 United States, to my knowledge.\n16 THE COURT:  Yeah, I agree.  I'm struggling with that.\n17 MR. ROTH:  But I'm trying to get to the purpose of it.\n18 The purpose of it is is there some sort of obvious mistake that\n19 is sort of potentially being made and is there a chance to\n20 remedy that mistake?  \n21 And I'm not sure here what the mistake, possible\n22 mistake would have been, and they haven't said it.  The point\n23 of a hearing -- it's not a formal hearing, It's an opportunity\n24 to tell your side of the story -- is is there some material,\n25 factual dispute.  You got it wrong, right?  That's not my\n\n    65\n 1 signature.  \n 2 What is that?  Like, they haven't said what it is.\n 3 And I think if there was something like that, then we would\n 4 have heard it by now, if not in public, then in the filings.\n 5 So what's the purpose of saying the President needs to\n 6 hear her out?  Well, what is it that she's going to say and how\n 7 is it going to change the conclusion in his letter that either\n 8 this was intentional and, therefore, potentially criminal or,\n 9 at minimum, it was negligent and therefore itself grounds for\n10 removal?  I just haven't heard what the story is that she wants\n11 to share that would change that in any conceivable way.\n12 THE COURT:  What is your reaction to -- when I read\n13 the plaintiff's opening brief, I thought they were taking the\n14 position that pre-office or pre-position conduct was off\n15 limits.  They're not going that far.\n16 What is your response to -- what if it's something\n17 that was known to the President making the appointment and\n18 known to the Senate who confirmed the person?\n19 MR. ROTH:  Yeah.\n20 THE COURT:  It feels weird to then allow -- and look,\n21 there are a lot of things that courts can't review that feel\n22 weird.  So I'm not suggesting that I fill in a gap that doesn't\n23 exist.  I'm going to look very closely at the reviewability\n24 question.  \n25 But if this were reviewable to some degree, it feels\n\n    66\n 1 weird that an administration could kind of go back and\n 2 second-guess the determinations of prior administrations and\n 3 Congress in their advise and consent role.\n 4 MR. ROTH:  I had a similar reaction.  I think if it\n 5 was something that was known at the time, it's much harder to\n 6 say that it's cause later because the presumption is that has\n 7 gone through the political process and a judgment has been\n 8 made.  But again, that's not the facts here.\n 9 THE COURT:  I know.  But if I rule in a certain way, I\n10 want to make sure that it's not something that's just unique to\n11 this situation.\n12 MR. ROTH:  Of course.  I absolutely understand that.\n13 I said before that I thought cause is a reason that is more\n14 than mere policy disagreement that bears on the individual's\n15 ability or fitness to do the job.  You could add to that that\n16 was not known at the time of confirmation.\n17 THE COURT:  How is that fleshed out?  What if there's\n18 disagreements about what's known at the time?  Then you have to\n19 look at their materials that they submitted to the Senate and\n20 depose the White House officials who did the vetting.\n21 MR. ROTH:  I don't think we're going to depose.\n22 That's usually a hard no.\n23 THE COURT:  Right.  That's why I'm thinking of the\n24 most kind of extreme example of how you would look into this.\n25 MR. ROTH:  Right.  And look, that plays into the\n\n    67\n 1 reviewability argument, which is maybe we don't go down the\n 2 road at all.  We can define what we think the statute means.\n 3 And the President is constitutionally obligated to follow the\n 4 laws of the United States faithfully.  And so that applies\n 5 whether it's reviewable or not.\n 6 But yeah, once you start getting into review, we do\n 7 have a lot of questions that are going to come up.\n 8 THE COURT:  But then I keep going back to what\n 9 everyone has agreed is the unique nature of this Board and the\n10 need for independence and how that maps on to all of these\n11 questions.\n12 Because in other areas where matters aren't\n13 reviewable, their independence is not what's going on.  This is\n14 purely within the prerogative of the President to decide who to\n15 pardon, to decide a number of things that courts don't get\n16 involved with.\n17 What about the unique nature and the importance of\n18 this being an independent body that is not supposed to be\n19 responsive to any type of political pressure?\n20 MR. ROTH:  Right.  Your Honor, all I could really say\n21 is that's why we are not contesting for present purposes the\n22 legitimacy of the for-cause removal provision.  Which is very\n23 different from arguments that have been made in the other\n24 removal cases over the past number of months.\n25 But that is separate from reviewability.  They're two\n\n    68\n 1 separate questions.  I think on reviewability the governing\n 2 case law is Reagan, which says it's still committed to the\n 3 President's discretion.  The President has a constitutional\n 4 obligation to follow the law.  It doesn't always mean it's\n 5 subject to judicial review.\n 6 THE COURT:  Right.  But I think it's kind of circular.\n 7 In the sense that where there is cause, it's not reviewable, to\n 8 me is different from the question of if there's cause, which\n 9 necessarily requires a court to determine what cause is.\n10 If I adopt your definition or if the case law compels\n11 that definition, then once a reason is articulated that's\n12 outside that definition, it could be highly differential,\n13 nothing to do, nothing further to review.\n14 But in the first instance, do you dispute that a court\n15 has an obligation to consider an argument?  Because their\n16 argument essentially boils down to this is not cause.  So I was\n17 essentially removed from my position without cause.\n18 MR. ROTH:  Yeah.  We are -- our initial position is\n19 that under Reagan it's not reviewable.  But I am sort of\n20 quickly pivoting to the point that, to the extent it's\n21 reviewable, it's a discretionary and therefore deferential\n22 level of review.\n23 And all of the factors that counsel on the other side\n24 said are relevant are things that are appropriate for the\n25 President to take into account, and I don't think this\n\n    69\n 1 determination sort of comes close to the edges of that.  And,\n 2 therefore, they can't show likelihood of success on the merits\n 3 on the substantive claim.\n 4 THE COURT:  I agree with you when I think about kind\n 5 of what procedural protections would look like; it is difficult\n 6 to map on.  But I also, as I said, understand very clearly why\n 7 the case law makes clear that elected officials don't have a\n 8 protected property interest in their positions.  And I\n 9 understand very clearly why employees do.\n10 MR. ROTH:  Right.\n11 THE COURT:  This doesn't seem to fit neatly in either\n12 category.  And it I guess if I had to say what it's closer to,\n13 I think I would put it closer to an employee than an elected\n14 official.  How do I decide --\n15 MR. ROTH:  Let me make two points on that.  Number\n16 one, I think Taylor is the case we cited that involves an\n17 elected official.\n18 THE COURT:  Yeah.  \n19 MR. ROTH:  I think that the other case we cited,\n20 Crenshaw, not an elected official.\n21 THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll look at that.\n22 MR. ROTH:  And then the second thing I would say is\n23 for constitutional purposes the relevant distinction is not\n24 elected versus appointed.  That's not really a distinction that\n25 has a lot of significance legally in the doctrine.\n\n    70\n 1 It's between officers and employees.  That's the\n 2 distinction that comes up over and over again in the case law.\n 3 And of course, you have principal officers and inferior\n 4 officers and then employees.  So there's really three\n 5 categories.\n 6 But the way I see it, the higher you get through that,\n 7 the lower the standard of sort of any procedural due process\n 8 protections that apply, because those are much more sensitive\n 9 political positions than mere employees.\n10 THE COURT:  Anything you want to say about irreparable\n11 harm?\n12 MR. ROTH:  Yeah, I do.  I think of irreparable harm,\n13 often I think of it as together with the other equitable\n14 factors.  It's sort of the balance, sort of trying to figure\n15 out, all right, if the Court gets it wrong one way versus the\n16 other way, who's going to be hurt more.\n17 And I think Wilcox and Boyle resolve it pretty\n18 decisively in the government's favor in these removal cases.\n19 The Supreme Court said in Wilcox, I think the harm of\n20 having somebody in office who was -- sort of is wrongfully\n21 there, that harm outweighs the harm of somebody being\n22 wrongfully removed from office for a period --\n23 THE COURT:  Isn't that in the context of the Article 2\n24 power?  Do you agree that this Board doesn't exercise\n25 substantial executive power or would you take issue with that?\n\n    71\n 1 MR. ROTH:  I don't think we've said that and I don't\n 2 know that I've taken a position on that.  \n 3 THE COURT:  Okay.\n 4 MR. ROTH:  But yes, Wilcox is different in the sense\n 5 that the argument we were making in Wilcox -- the government\n 6 was making in Wilcox was that the restriction on removal was\n 7 unconstitutional and, therefore, the President had the power to\n 8 remove at will.\n 9 Whereas the argument we're making here is that the\n10 President has satisfied the statutory restriction of for-cause\n11 removal.  To me, that's a difference that goes to the merits.\n12 For the purposes of the balance-of-harms\n13 consideration, where we're just looking at what's worse,\n14 somebody being out of office when they should be in or somebody\n15 being in office when they should be out, I read the Supreme\n16 Court's decision in Wilcox to say that one outweighs the other.\n17 And then the Supreme Court reiterated in Boyle that\n18 that governs.  Lower courts need to follow that in materially\n19 similar cases.  And I think those are the same factors we're\n20 considering here for purposes of the non-merits piece of the\n21 injunction calculus.\n22 THE COURT:  If I could go back to the due process\n23 question, because you were drawing a distinction between\n24 employees and officers.\n25 MR. ROTH:  Yeah.\n\n    72\n 1 THE COURT:  And I'm recalling cases that seem to\n 2 equate the protections because they arise from the for-cause\n 3 provisions of the statutes.  Meaning that where a statute\n 4 allows removal for cause, that that's what provides a property\n 5 interest.  Can you speak to that?\n 6 MR. ROTH:  They make sort of a constitutional due\n 7 process argument and then they make a sort of the statute\n 8 confers the protection.  But I think, again, they'll take the\n 9 Court back to Reagan because I think that -- respectfully, I\n10 think they're misreading the case.\n11 What the Supreme Court said was that if the statute\n12 provides a list of causes, then you need to be told which one\n13 is the one that covers you.  And then there's some opportunity\n14 to say, no, that's wrong, it's not -- I don't fit within it.  \n15 But the court said when there's no list, that doesn't\n16 apply.  That was true in Reagan and it's equally true here.\n17 And that makes sense because when we're not talking about a\n18 sort of reticulated scheme where you could say, no, I'm not\n19 covered by C-5, this is cause.  It's very open-ended.  That\n20 standard doesn't really make any sense in that context.\n21 THE COURT:  Let's make a huge assumption that there\n22 was a due process violation of some sort.  What would be the\n23 appropriate remedy and is that in and of itself a form of\n24 irreparable harm that maybe makes it distinct from other cases\n25 that I don't necessarily understand if those cases also involve\n\n    73\n 1 specific constitutional --\n 2 MR. ROTH:  Let me take the second piece of that first.\n 3 I don't think it's different from an irreparable harm\n 4 standpoint because I think that the thing that is being\n 5 deprived is the office or the employment, which is the same\n 6 thing as in all the other removal cases that we've been talking\n 7 about.\n 8 By the way, the most recent one to sort of catalog the\n 9 law is the Perlmutter.  The Library of Congress case goes\n10 through this in a lot of detail.\n11 THE COURT:  Yeah.\n12 MR. ROTH:  So I understand, like often we say\n13 deprivation of First Amendment rights is irreparable harm.\n14 That's because you want to speak.  You're not speaking.  You\n15 can't go back in time and speak.\n16 Here, if the argument is, well, I was entitled to an\n17 opportunity to challenge this in advance, I didn't get it,\n18 what's the consequence?  The consequence is I'm not in office\n19 right now when I should be.  That's exactly the same harm that\n20 is addressed in those other cases.\n21 In terms of what the remedy would be if the Court\n22 found that there should have been that opportunity, I think\n23 that's really tricky because, again, I have not heard -- I\n24 still have not heard, at least, from my understanding, what\n25 they think the hearing would accomplish, what is the fact they\n\n    74\n 1 want to present.  And I think --\n 2 THE COURT:  I don't even know if they're saying that\n 3 there needs to be a hearing, so to speak.\n 4 MR. ROTH:  I'm using that in a colloquial sense.  The\n 5 opportunity to be heard, to say what.\n 6 THE COURT:  A response.  Using it colloquially, like\n 7 that it's just responding by letter and having it read might be\n 8 sufficient.\n 9 MR. ROTH:  Right.  So the remedy really isn't\n10 reinstatement.  It's like, okay, send the letter and maybe the\n11 President will change his mind.  Sometimes he changes his mind\n12 about things.  \n13 But I don't see how that gets them to reinstatement.\n14 And I just don't think they've made the showing that would be\n15 necessary for a preliminary injunction, that that would make a\n16 difference under these circumstances when I think the\n17 President's letter was pretty clear.  \n18 Either it's A or it's B but either way I conclude that\n19 it's cause.  And I have not heard anything from them to say,\n20 oh, no, it's neither A nor B, there's some third explanation\n21 for this that doesn't actually track either of those\n22 possibilities.  And if that existed, I would have expected to\n23 have heard it.\n24 THE COURT:  If I can go back, again, I think the\n25 acknowledgment that it can't be for policy disagreements, I'm\n\n    75\n 1 trying to think how that -- when there is an accusation or an\n 2 allegation in a complaint that someone has been fired for\n 3 personal policy agreements, President's letter does not reflect\n 4 that, yes, it's highly deferential.  But what does a Court do?\n 5 Deferential doesn't mean that there's no probing of\n 6 it, it just means that you assume good faith and defer.  But it\n 7 doesn't mean that there's not a review, that there's not an\n 8 inquiry that takes place.  So what does that look like?\n 9 MR. ROTH:  Well, I think the Supreme Court decisions\n10 really don't contemplate it.  So it's hard for me to tell you\n11 like, oh, in these circumstances that would be allowed.\n12 The way I read those cases, you don't probe.  When the\n13 President is statutorily empowered to make a determination\n14 that's discretionary and he makes the determination and on its\n15 face it's valid, we don't probe the sincerity or the motives.\n16 That's just the general rule.\n17 And again, if there's some extreme case, I don't want\n18 to be super categorical but I can't concede that like, oh,\n19 yeah, if it was on these facts we think the Court would be\n20 allowed to call them in for a deposition and ask him, did you\n21 really mean it, or override it when its on its face it's valid.\n22 That's Trump versus Hawaii.  We litigated that.\n23 THE COURT:  Okay.  I don't have any other questions\n24 unless you wanted to say more in response.\n25 MR. ROTH:  No.  I think I covered the points I wanted\n\n    76\n 1 to cover.\n 2 Thank you, Your Honor, for your time.\n 3 THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.\n 4 MR. LOWELL:  Let me take the time to respond to what\n 5 counsel said and only what counsel said.\n 6 THE COURT:  Okay.  You have the last word.  It's your\n 7 motion.\n 8 MR. LOWELL:  Thank you.  First thing that I wrote down\n 9 that he said was this is not that case where the President is\n10 just asserting, I have Article 2 power, period.  He said the\n11 President concedes that he has Article 2 power but had to frame\n12 it in the statute's requirement for cause.\n13 But, Your Honor, there's no difference if the\n14 President says, I have Article 2 power, and by the way, I am\n15 putting in the single word \"cause\" without explaining in any\n16 fashion the basis of that cause.  Or, as we have been spending\n17 many minutes on, what does it mean to get to the point where\n18 there is the ability to contest that cause.\n19 In other words, just putting the word \"cause\" next to\n20 Article 2 doesn't make it better.  The cause has to stand for\n21 something, and just simply using the word doesn't seem enough.  \n22 So if that's not enough, the President gave you what\n23 he meant.  Again, I point out the August 26th public statement,\n24 when he said if she had acted properly.\n25 And you would have thought that that would have then\n\n    77\n 1 followed with look what she did on her alleged form.  But\n 2 that's not what he said.  The propriety of what he said was\n 3 that she wouldn't go along with an interest rate, which the\n 4 government agrees would be a policy issue, which the courts\n 5 have said is not the same as cause.\n 6 Counsel then said you defer to the President if\n 7 there's, quote, any reason to call into question a person's\n 8 fitness.\n 9 Any reason?  Not in the face of something that calls\n10 for cause.  So they're synonymous?  Any reason now is cause.\n11 Well, what does he mean by any reason?  I have to\n12 because you and I and he are dealing with hypotheticals.  I\n13 don't know what that could possibly mean.\n14 Could the President decide that it was cause because\n15 Federal Governor Cook decides to attend her meetings in a pants\n16 suit versus a dress, and he doesn't think that is enough\n17 respect for the institution?  That's cause.\n18 Did he mean that she teaches at a school that he\n19 disagrees with because of their DEI policies, and that's cause?\n20 Or you don't agree with my decision to lower the interest rates\n21 because you didn't consider the right factors?\n22 Well, we know that can't be.  So where along the\n23 continuum is, to use counsel's phrase, any reason to call into\n24 question a person's fitness?\n25 Then, as to the issue of my explaining that, again,\n\n    78\n 1 we're being very cautious, I use the word \"pretext\" in its\n 2 context of what you asked me about.  When there's no cause, you\n 3 look at its surrounding.  If a word in a statute isn't clear,\n 4 you look for the surrounding words to make it clear and other\n 5 such things.\n 6 And he said, well, sure, he said that about Chairman\n 7 Powell.  He never said anything about Governor Cook at the time\n 8 that he was railing about Chairman Powell.  Okay, we'll accept\n 9 that.  But when he took his best swing in his baseball bat\n10 against the Chairman and that didn't get him what he wanted,\n11 then he took the swing at the next person up at the plate.  And\n12 that has context.\n13 It doesn't answer the question if he misuses the word\n14 \"fraud\" or he misuses the FHA, and it doesn't succeed against\n15 the first Governor and then he moves to the next Governor, that\n16 has context.  \n17 Counsel said you look at what the President said.  And\n18 I've already indicated more than once, and I won't do it a\n19 third time, what it is the President said when it was asked\n20 what it was to be proper.\n21 And then I want to talk about this idea that Governor\n22 Cook has had all this opportunity to respond and hasn't.\n23 Really?  She's had all this opportunity?  It was this posting\n24 at a social media by Director Pulte.\n25 And then in the brief, counsel for the government says\n\n    79\n 1 they took great pains not to discuss the allegations.  But\n 2 today in court stands up and says, well, look at the\n 3 allegations.  She had these two different entries and he says\n 4 they're contradictory.\n 5 I don't accept his conclusion that they're\n 6 contradictory.  Certainly not here.  But at the same time he\n 7 can't have it both ways.  He can't say that she had an\n 8 opportunity -- and we're not getting into the merits.  And he\n 9 says in all this briefing there's not one part which talks\n10 about what she would have answered.\n11 That's not the place for this.  The place is not in\n12 the pleading in which we say she hasn't been given an\n13 opportunity.  By the way, we don't say here is the response to\n14 the President having no basis to remove her, but let me tell\n15 you in the next 15 pages what her defense to an allegation\n16 would be if it was properly made against her.\n17 There is, then, opportunity but it's not in the\n18 briefing as to whether or not there should be a TRO because\n19 whatever \"cause\" means, it means something different than what\n20 was done to seek her removal.\n21 And it can't be, as I said when I rose to the podium\n22 the first time, that we're supposed to litigate the merits of\n23 this underlying, unsubstantiated charge by way of, as I said,\n24 my now having to sign on to social media, which I've avoided\n25 for however many years, so that I can respond in that fashion.  \n\n    80\n 1 There's a place for that response, with documents and\n 2 facts and that could be the chair -- to the Pulte or whatever.\n 3 But it's certainly not in a brief that's raising that this\n 4 shouldn't have happened the way it did.  And it's not because\n 5 we have the ability to respond even to the 31 remaining tweets.\n 6 I guess you call it a tweet even if it's not on Twitter.  I\n 7 don't remember.  But anyway, that's not the place.  \n 8 And as to his saying look at what the President did,\n 9 boy, did she have an opportunity.  Wow, 30 minutes after\n10 Director Pulte posted, 30 minutes, the President said she needs\n11 to resign because what she did was bad.  And if she doesn't\n12 resign -- not answer the charge, not give me information, not\n13 give Pulte.  If she doesn't resign, I'm going to fire her.\n14 That is not an opportunity to be heard.\n15 As to the issue of the officers of not having -- and\n16 we will address this but I did before raise the issue of the\n17 case.  It is Shurtleff versus United States.  It's a Supreme\n18 Court case in 1903.\n19 I thought in their brief and at the podium he said\n20 that if there's an officer, there's no due process right.\n21 You're parsing whether it's an employee or an officer or an\n22 elected officer and appointed officer.  That case directly\n23 contradicts the idea that if the person is an officer, and\n24 whether it doesn't distinguish between senior and not, that\n25 officer's removal does get the right to have due process.\n\n    81\n 1 So we will address that.  But I think that parsing as\n 2 to what kind of officer gets that you'll see doesn't solve the\n 3 problem of what happened here.\n 4 And again, I point out this notion that if we're\n 5 trying to figure out what processes do, which is always the\n 6 phrase a court uses, not only as what processes do is where\n 7 that should take place, and we haven't had that opportunity.\n 8 And if what the government is now saying is, well, you\n 9 should have -- first, Pulte does it privately to the Attorney\n10 General on the 15th.  No one knows about that.  Then he decides\n11 to make it public, not to her but to the world, on the 20th,\n12 making the allegations in that first one.  There's no\n13 particular way that you could address that.\n14 And that decision or lack of decision to answer him\n15 right away in a public media is what the due process clause\n16 allows or requires?  I don't think so.\n17 And then he has added now the phrase \"reason to call\n18 into question a person's fitness.\"  So I question, okay, by\n19 who?  We know.  The President.  \n20 And he has added, okay, so now we'll add that was\n21 known at the time.  And Your Honor has already come to that\n22 question.\n23 So that's an interesting concession.  I can assure you\n24 that in the vetting process of the United States Senate for\n25 something as important as the Governor of the Federal Reserve\n\n    82\n 1 Board, her financial documents, bank records, loans, et cetera\n 2 were submitted as part of the vetting and part of the\n 3 presentation, and the Senate had the opportunity to look at\n 4 them.\n 5 And so if they're saying that there's this glaring\n 6 contradiction between two houses that at one point might have\n 7 been, quote, contradictory because they're both principal,\n 8 well, again, I don't know how you want to go back in time but I\n 9 will tell you that -- and if all I need to do is in our next\n10 show that we submitted -- we, the Governor submitted all of\n11 that into the Senate, we can do that as well.  \n12 So I like the concession and, therefore, if that's the\n13 case, we'll take it.  And therefore, a new President shouldn't\n14 undo what the past President did of everything that Director\n15 Pulte did was before them at the time that they made their\n16 decision to confirm.\n17 The next thing he said was on the irreparable harm,\n18 and I think Your Honor questioned that and questioned it in the\n19 right way as to whether we were talking about an agency that\n20 has that executive power when he talks about Wilcox and others.\n21 And consequently, he mentioned -- or you mentioned\n22 Dellinger.  I think the question was Dellinger was allowed to\n23 remain in office for the period that goes to the litigation,\n24 which goes, again, to not removing somebody in the context of\n25 these issues being litigated for the irreparable harm.\n\n    83\n 1 And then, I think, he also then concluded with two\n 2 points that I'll conclude on.  The first is that he said, so if\n 3 the issue is whether somebody should be out, is out when they\n 4 should be in, versus the harm about that she is in when she\n 5 should be out, that's a tautology that basically turns on its\n 6 head everything we've been discussing for the last however many\n 7 minutes or hours.\n 8 Again, it goes to the issue of what do you mean should\n 9 be out when she should be in.  That, then, underscores all the\n10 issues of what is for cause, what is the opportunity to contest\n11 that cause.\n12 And it's certainly not counsel for the government\n13 sitting at a podium or me representing Governor Cook that\n14 should be the ones to figure out, now, at this juncture, that\n15 she should have been out when in or should have been in when\n16 out.  That's what a process requires.\n17 Then you ask if the due process, what is the remedy.\n18 And I think I need to point out the slight contradiction in the\n19 positions of the government, where at one hand they say, well,\n20 she had five days to answer a tweet and she didn't.  And they\n21 say, well, you could have put it into your brief on the issues\n22 we're here today for, but that's not the place it should be.\n23 And so, consequently, she got all the opportunity she\n24 needed and she didn't take it.  So consequently, it stands\n25 uncontradicted.  So consequently, everything that happened is\n\n    84\n 1 okay and this should stand.  None of that is the case.\n 2 And finally, I just want to, again, point out that we\n 3 are in a unique situation because of the history of the Fed and\n 4 its Governors, et cetera.  \n 5 But it shouldn't be that the government gets to say\n 6 look at how unique the Fed is as a way of defending their\n 7 dismissal of an NLRB member or a Consumer Product Safety Board\n 8 member or a PCAOB member.  Because they say, so look, if it was\n 9 the Fed we wouldn't be saying this, and now it is the Fed and\n10 they're saying the same thing.  Thank you.\n11 MR. ROTH:  Am I able to make just a couple quick\n12 points?\n13 THE COURT:  Sure.\n14 MR. ROTH:  Sorry, I know it's surrebuttal but just to\n15 clean up a couple things.\n16 THE COURT:  Okay.\n17 MR. ROTH:  So counsel mentioned a few times this\n18 August 26th press statement.\n19 THE COURT:  Yes.\n20 MR. ROTH:  I think it's a YouTube clip.  I confess, I\n21 haven't watched it.  But based on the way it was quoted in\n22 their brief, I understood it to be saying something very\n23 different.\n24 I thought the quote was that if the reporters had done\n25 their job, we would not have Dr. Cook on the Board because\n\n    85\n 1 these issues would have been fleshed out years ago.  So I did\n 2 not understand that at all to be some sort of concession of,\n 3 oh, well, the real reason was something about interest rates.\n 4 But I have to watch it.\n 5 The second point, counsel says the brief is not the\n 6 place to make our case about why this was unfair or not a\n 7 legitimate rationale for termination because we were entitled\n 8 to make that argument to the President first.  That seems to be\n 9 what he's saying.\n10 But Your Honor, we're here in equity.  They're asking\n11 for preliminary injunction.  They need to show why it matters.\n12 They need to show what is the fact in dispute that they would\n13 have contested had they been given the chance, because\n14 otherwise this is all futile.\n15 And I don't need to go as far as to say it's unclean\n16 hands that they haven't contested, like the underlying facts,\n17 but it's certainly not enough to get an injunction.\n18 And then, finally, on Dellinger and the balance of\n19 harms, the way the injunction factors work, you consider the\n20 merits and then separately you ask if one side is -- we assume\n21 one side is right on the merits and the Court goes the other\n22 way, what's the harm?  Compare that to if --\n23 THE COURT:  Right.\n24 MR. ROTH:  The opposite.  That's what I was saying\n25 with you weigh the harm of a wrongful person -- you know, a\n\n    86\n 1 person being in when they should be out versus being out when\n 2 they should be in, it assumes the weight of the merits because\n 3 that's a separate factor on the preliminary injunction test.\n 4 And under Dellinger, Dellinger was stayed.  I don't\n 5 know what counsel's referring to.  Yes, he was allowed to -- he\n 6 was reinstated and then the D.C. Circuit stayed that and said\n 7 that's wrong, and then he dismissed the case.\n 8 So yes, he was temporarily allowed to remain but the\n 9 D.C. Circuit overturned that decision.  So I don't know how it\n10 helps him.\n11 Thank you for your indulgence.\n12 MR. LOWELL:  Last sentence and then I'm done.\n13 THE COURT:  Okay.\n14 MR. LOWELL:  The difference is that the President has\n15 made clear what he'll do that's different than the facts of\n16 Dellinger.  So by the time we get to the point of where\n17 Dellinger was, she'd be out of her job, her seat would be\n18 filled, it wouldn't be possible to do what was done to get her\n19 back when she should have never been taken out to begin with.\n20 We will address that further.\n21 THE COURT:  Okay.\n22 MR. LOWELL:  You've been very indulgent.  I appreciate\n23 it.\n24 THE COURT:  No, this is very helpful.  \n25 Can I have you stay at the podium so we can just\n\n    87\n 1 figure out scheduling.\n 2 So you're going to file a reply on Tuesday.  And then\n 3 in terms of next -- does it make sense for me to ask the\n 4 parties to just confer about next steps?\n 5 Because what's on the table is, instead of a TRO, this\n 6 is a PI -- this converts to a PI.  Or you're going to\n 7 separately file a PI and then summary judgment, or we just\n 8 expedite summary judgment and dispense with some of these\n 9 preliminary steps.\n10 MR. LOWELL:  I think -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\n11 MR. ROTH:  I'm happy to confer.  I'm not sure there's\n12 a purpose served to another motion.\n13 THE COURT:  Right.  I'm trying to avoid --\n14 MR. ROTH:  Like if you're going to file a reply and\n15 maybe we have something we want to say, but that doesn't\n16 require a whole new motion, starting over.\n17 MR. LOWELL:  I don't disagree with that.  I do think\n18 that as you have given us the ability, I want to read the\n19 30 pages in detail and I will have a response.  If I said\n20 something that you feel like you need to, I don't know, you\n21 should probably do that.\n22 I don't know that we need that interim step but what\n23 we do need to figure out is what's going to happen in between.\n24 And again, using your Dellinger point, it's not going\n25 to work.  If the government's position is let this play out for\n\n    88\n 1 another day or three days, seven days, and in the interim the\n 2 president fills the seat that Governor Cook should have never\n 3 been relieved of -- I will talk to counsel and the Federal\n 4 Reserve --\n 5 THE COURT:  I do agree.  I have so many cases where\n 6 there's different iterations of the same brief being filed over\n 7 and over with different labels, and if we could just get to the\n 8 point and give me a little time to think about these novel\n 9 issues.\n10 So yeah, if you want to just talk and let me know what\n11 you're going to do.  I certainly would give you -- both sides\n12 an opportunity to supplement what they filed, because I know\n13 everyone did it on very quick timelines.\n14 Okay.  And if you could do that on Tuesday in\n15 connection with this reply and let me know what's coming, that\n16 would be helpful.\n17 MR. LOWELL:  We'll try to do that.  We'll figure out a\n18 way to get in touch.\n19 THE COURT:  Okay.  If there's nothing else, thank you\n20 everyone.\n21 (Proceedings concluded at 12:02 PM) \n22\n23\n24\n25\n\nC E R T I F I C A T E \n \nI, Stacy Johns, certify that the foregoing is an \naccurate transcription of the proceedings in the \nabove-entitled matter. \n \n \n          /s/ Stacy Johns               Date: August 29, 2025 \n                \n          Stacy Johns, RPR, RCR \n          Official Court Reporter  \n                 ",

Eisen        Abbe David Lowell \nDEMOCRACY DEFENDERS FUND   LOWELL & ASSOCIATES, PLLC \n600 Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E.   1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 250 \nSE #15180           Washington, DC 20005  \nWashington, DC 20003      T: (202) 964-6110   \nT: (202) 601-8678        F: (202) 964-6116 \nnorman@democracydefenders.org  ALowellPublicOutreach@ \n            lowellandassociates.com\n \n\nPlaintiff-Appellee Lisa D. Cook (โGovernor Cookโ) respectfully opposes the \nentry of an administrative stay.  Subject to the Courtโs permission, Governor Cook \nproposes to separately file a memorandum in opposition to the Governmentโs motion \nfor a stay pending appeal by September 18, 2025.   \nThe extraordinary remedy of an administrative stay is wholly unwarranted in \nthis case.  See, e.g., KalshiEX LLC v. Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n, 119 F.4th \n58, 63 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  The Government has identified no exigency that would \njustify an immediate administrative stay that would operate to disrupt the status quo. \nAt all times during this litigation, Governor Cook has been performing her duties as a \nduly-nominated  and  confirmed  member  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Boardโand  the \ndistrict courtโs September 9, 2025 order has confirmed that her purported removal was \nunlawful.  Critically, Governor Cookโs duties have included preparing for next weekโs \n(September 16โ17, 2025) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy meeting, \nat which she and other members of the FOMC will review the Federal Reserveโs \nmonetary policy, issue statements on market outlook, and vote on interest rates.  An \nadministrative stay would threaten Governor Cookโs participation in next weekโs \nmeeting and potentially plunge the FOMCโs vote into turmoil.  In addition, it has the \nreal potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets.  The Government has \nprovided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.  This is the \nparadigmatic example of when entering a stay would be against the public interest, \n1 \n\ngiven โthe disruptive effect of the repeated removal and reinstatement of officers \nduring the pendency of . . . litigation.โ  Trump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (2025). \nAll relevant considerations weigh against entering an administrative stay.  In \narguing that Governor Cook is not at risk of irreparable harm, the Government points \nto Chief Justice Robertsโs recent issuance of an administrative stay in Trump v. \nSlaughter, No. 25A264, 2025 WL 2582814, (U.S. Sept. 8, 2025).  But as the court \nbelow correctly noted in discussing that order, a nonprecedential administrative stay \norder โprovides no basis to doubt the logic of Slaughter as applied to this case.โ  Cook \nv. Trump et al., No. 1:25-cv-02903, ECF 27 at 43 (citing United States v. Texas, 144\nS. Ct. 797, 798 (2024) (Barrett, J. concurring in denial of applications to vacate stay)\n(โAdministrative stays do not typically reflect the courtโs consideration of the merits \nof the stay application.โ)).  The precedential value of such a stay is especially limited \nwhen it is entered by a single justice rather than the full Court.  See Dep't of State v. \nAIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., 145 S. Ct. 753 (2025) (vacating administrative stay \nissued by Chief Justice Roberts); In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 586 U.S. 1112 (2019) \n(same). \nIn  its  request  for  an  administrative  stay,  the  government  relies  on  the \nadministrative stays granted in Slaughter, Trump v. Wilcox, No. 24A966 (U.S. Apr. \n9, 2025), and Grundmann v. Trump, No. 25-5165 (D.C. Cir. June 18, 2025).  Mot. at \n4. As a threshold matter, โthe Supreme Court made clear [in Wilcox] that its analysis\n2 \n\ndid not extend to the Federal Reserve Boardโs โfor causeโ protection.โ  ECF 27 at 22. \nThat is because the Federal Reserve is โa uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that \nfollows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United \nStates.โ  Trump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415.  The same is not true of any of the \nagencies at issue in those casesโthe NLRB (Wilcox), FTC (Slaughter), and FLRA \n(Grundmann).    \nSlaughter is also factually distinguishable from the present case because FTC \nCommissioner  Slaughter  was  fired,  removed,  prevented  from  exercising  the \nresponsibilities of her office, and sought reinstatement.  Here, Governor Cook has at \nall times continued to fulfill her duties on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, so \nentering an administrative stay would change the status quo. \nThe other two stay orders relied on by the Government, Wilcox and Grundmann, \nare equally inapposite.  As the court noted below, the Wilcox stay โdoes not speak to \nwhether Cook has adequately demonstrated irreparable harm here.โ  ECF 27 at 42.  \nThat is because โ(1) the plaintiffs [in Wilcox] had failed to show that they would \nsucceed on their merits challenges, which are significantly different from Cookโs, and \n(2) because the harms to the plaintiffs from โbeing unable to perform [their] statutory \ndut[ies]โ were outweighed by the โgreater risk of harm from an order allowing a \nremoved officer to continue exercising the executive power.โโ  ECF 27 at 42 (internal \ncitation omitted).  Because โCookโs retention on the Board of Governors does not \n3 \n\noffend the Presidentโs Article II authority in the way the officersโ reinstatement was \nfound to in Wilcox and Boyleโ โ[t]he Governmentโs claimed injuries carry less weight \nhere than in Wilcox and Boyle.โ  Id. at 46.  And because the stay in Grundmann was \nโpremised on the balance of harms theory endorsed by Wilcox, and did not address \nthe merits of the plaintiffsโ irreparable harm arguments  it โdo[es]  not provide \nreason to doubt the district court[โs] analys[i]s on that issue.โ  Id. at 43 n.13.  \nFurther, this Court yesterday, in preventing the removal of the Register of \nCopyrights  and  Director  of  the  U.S.  Copyright  Office  (an  official  with  fewer \nprotections than a Federal Reserve Governor) pending appeal, reaffirmed that there \nare certain instances where an officer faces greater risk of harm from being unable to \nperform her statutory duties than the Government faces from allowing her to continue \nserving in her role.  Perlmutter v. Blanche, No. 25-5285, Order (D.C. Cir. Sept. 10, \n2025).  This is another such case.  As the district court articulated in distinguishing \nthis case from Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5052, 2025 WL 887518, at *4 (D.C. Cir. \nMar 10, 2025), Governor Cookโs โretention on the Board of Governors does not pose \nthe same harmsโ to the administrationโs exercise of executive power as other removal \ncases.   ECF 27 at 44.  โShe is  one member of a multi-member body that the \nGovernment concedes cannot be subject to policy pressure from the rest of the \nExecutive Branch.  Thus, her continued presence on the Board does not cause a similar \ndegree of harm.โ  Id.  Additionally, โthe Fedโs most important responsibility is \n4 \n\nadministration of the money supply,โ and โadministration of the money supply is not \nan executive function.โ  Consumersโ Rsch. v. CPSC, 98 F.4th 646, 656 (5th Cir. \n2024) (Oldham, J., joined by seven other judges, dissenting from denial of rehearing \nen  banc).  Preventing  the  President  from  wresting  control  over  this  countryโs \nindependent central bank does not constitute irreparable harm to the Government.  \nIn further distinguishing this case from Dellinger, the district court correctly \nnoted that whereas โin Dellinger, the Circuitโs stay addressed only one harm to \nDellinger, the deprivation of his statutory right to function in office,โ here Governor \nCook โpresents additional harms that flow from this deprivation that the D.C. Circuit \ndid not consider, including those to the agencyโs independence and the possibility \nthat President Trump will shortly move to replace her on the Board.โ  Cook v. Trump \net al., No. 1:25-cv-02903, ECF 27 at 44.  The court in Dellinger explained that the \nwrongful removal of Special Counsel Dellinger would not constitute irreparable \nharm because โat worst, Dellinger would remain out of office for a short period of \ntime.โ  2025 WL 887518, at *4 (emphasis added).  Not so here.  The President has \nindicated  he  will  attempt  to  confirm  Governor  Cookโs  permanent  replacement \nswiftly, stating, โwe have some very good people for that positionโ and โ[w]eโll have \na majority very shortly.โ  See Cook v. Trump et al., No. 1:25-cv-02903, ECF 2-1 at \n18. And  specifically,  the  President  has  identified  Stephen  Miran,  whose\nnomination to fill a different Board seat has already been submitted to the Senate, as \n5 \n\na viable replacement for Governor Cook: โWe might switch him to [Cookโs seat]\nโitโs a longer term.โ  As the D.C. Circuit has explained, โ[t]hat could mean \nthat,  at  the  end  of  the  litigation,  there  would  be  no  seat  available  for  which \n[Cook] could serve as even the de facto occupant.โ  Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th \n1038, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  This case is thus entirely different from Dellinger, \nwhere โat worst,โ the Senate-confirmed officer โwould remain out of office for a \nshort  period  of  time.โ  2025  WL  887518,  at  *4.    This  consideration  further \ncounsels against changing the status quo by issuing an administrative stay. \nThese issues will be further addressed in our response to the Governmentโs \nMotion for a stay pending appeal.  In the interim, an administrative stay is improper. \nSeptember 11, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n/s/ Abbe David Lowell \nAbbe David Lowell  \nDavid A. Kolansky*  \nIsabella M.

A concurring statement of Circuit Judge Garcia, joined\nby Circuit Judge Childs, and a dissenting statement of Circuit Judge Katsas are\nattached.\nPer Curiam\nFOR THE COURT:\nClifton B. Cislak, Clerk \nBY: /s/\nDaniel J. Reidy \nDeputy Clerk\n* Circuit Judge Katsas would grant the motion for stay pending appeal.\n\n \nGARCIA, Circuit Judge, joined by CHILDS, Circuit Judge, \nconcurring: \nOn August 25, 2025, President Trump found โcauseโ to \nremove Lisa D. Cook from her position as a member of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  In this \ncourt, the government does not dispute that it failed to provide \nCook even minimal processโthat is, notice of the allegation \nagainst her and a meaningful opportunity to respondโbefore \nshe  was  purportedly  removed.    The  district  court  thus \npreliminarily enjoined Cookโs removal based, in part, on its \nconclusion  that  her  removal  likely  violated  the  Fifth \nAmendmentโs Due Process Clause.  That conclusion is correct.  \nFor that reasonโand because of the myriad unique features of \nthis case as compared to other recent challenges to presidential \nremovalsโI vote to deny the governmentโs emergency request \nfor a stay pending appeal. \nThe district court issued its preliminary injunction after \nfinding that Cook is likely to succeed on two of her claims: her \nsubstantive,  statutory  claim  that  she  was  removed  without \nโcauseโ  in  violation  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Act,  Cook v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 2607761, at *4โ12 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2025), \nand her procedural claim that she did not receive sufficient \nprocess prior to her removal in violation of the Due Process \nClause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment,  id.  at  *13โ17.    As  the \ngovernment does not dispute, Cookโs due process claim is \nreviewable.  See Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on Foreign Inv. in the \nU.S., 758 F.3d 296, 314 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  I agree with the \ndistrict courtโs conclusion that Cookโs due process claim is \nlikely to succeed. \nThe Supreme Court and this court have repeatedly held \nthat a public official with โfor causeโ protection from removal \nhas  a  constitutionally  protected  property  interest  in  her \nposition.  See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. \n532, 538โ39 (1985); Esparraguera v. Depโt of the Army, 101 \nF.4th 28, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (collecting cases).  Under those \n \n\n2 \nprecedents, Cook has such a property interest because the \nFederal Reserve Act provides that she may be removed only \nโfor cause.โ  12 U.S.C. ยง 242.  She therefore may not be \nremoved prior to being provided โsome kindโ of meaningful \nnotice and opportunity to respond.  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542 \n(cleaned up); see Esparraguera, 101 F.4th at 40. \nThe government contends that Loudermill and its progeny \ndo  not  apply  because  they  concern  mere  government \nemployees, and that principal officers of the United States like \nCook can never have property interests in their positions.  Mot. \nfor  Stay  18โ19.    The  distinction  between  employees  and \nprincipal officers is undoubtedly significant in certain respects.  \nBut the governmentโs categorical position is inconsistent with \nthe principles underlying due process analysis, and no case \nsupports it.   \nConsider first the longstanding focus of the due process \nanalysis in this context.  Courts ask whether the legislature has \ncreated  โa  legitimate  claim  of  entitlementโ  to  continued \nemployment.  Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. \n564, 577 (1972).  The reason a statute providing โfor causeโ \nprotection from removal creates a property interest is that it \nsupports an โobjective basis for believingโ that the employee \nwill โremain employed unless they do something warranting \ntheir termination.โ  Hall v. Ford, 856 F.2d 255, 265 (D.C. Cir. \n1988).    Here,  the  plain  purpose  of  providing  for-cause \nprotection was to assure members of the Board of Governorsโ\nand national and global marketsโthat they do not serve at will \nand thus enjoy a measure of policy independence from the \nPresident.  See, e.g., PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, 78 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018) (en banc), abrogated on other grounds by, \nSeila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020) (explaining that \nthe Federal Reserveโs โindependenceโ enables it โto pursue the \ngeneral public interest in the nationโs longer-term economic \n \n\n3 \nstability and successโ).  Those statutorily based expectations \ngive rise to a protected property interest.   \nThe government offers no reason why an official would \nhave a lesser expectation of continued employment based on a \nfor-cause  removal  protection  because  she  is  an  appointed \nofficerโeven a principal officerโrather than an employee.  \nInstead, the government draws on intuitions about the nature of \nprincipal officers in general.  And it is true:  The Supreme Court \nhas held that nearly all such officers are removable at will, see \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 215โ18, so it usually makes sense to \nthink  that  such  officers  have  no  legitimate  expectation  of \nretaining  their  positions.    But  in  this  singular  case  the \ngovernment has pointedly not argued that the President has \nunfettered  removal  authority  over  members  of  the  Federal \nReserve Systemโs Board of Governors.  To the contrary, the \ngovernment concedes that Cook is protected, by statute, from \nremoval  except  for  cause.    In  due  process  parlance,  that \nprotectionโif it does anything at allโprovides a โlegitimateโ \nand โobjective basis for believingโ that Cook does not serve at \nwill. \nWith  the  principles  underlying  modern  due  process \nprecedent stacked against it, the government turns to broad \nlanguage in inapposite cases.  The government relies primarily \non Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548 (1900).  In that case, the \nKentucky  general  assembly  resolved,  per  the  Kentucky \nConstitution, a contested gubernatorial election.  The losing \ncandidatesโwho had been temporarily installed in office after \nthe electionโargued that the legislatureโs action deprived them \nโof their property without due process of law.โ  Id. at 557.  The \nCourt rejected the notion that the candidates had any property \ninterest in their positions.  The government now seizes on the \nCourtโs statement that โpublic office is not property,โ id. at \n576, to argue that no appointment to a federal office, however \nstructured, could give rise to a protected property interest.   \n \n\n4 \nThe government overreads Taylor.  Crucially, the case \ninvolved  nothing  akin  to  a  statutory  for-cause  removal \nprotection:  The only argument for a property interest was that \nthe offices in question were โboth profitable and honorable.โ  \nId. at 557.  Taylor necessarily did not address the question we \nface here.  Further, much of the Courtโs rationale turned on the \nfact that the parties were seeking constitutionally established \nโelective officeโ and that the election had been resolved in \nexactly the way the state constitution envisioned.  Id. at 575; \nsee also id. (explaining that elected positions โcreated by the \nstate Constitutionโ are โheld solely in accordance with the \nterms of that instrumentโ).  The government has not offered a \nsound basis to extend Taylorโs holding to a federal appointed \noffice Congress created and endowed with for-cause removal \nprotection.   \nThe governmentโs other two cases are also inapposite.  \nCrenshaw v. United States, 134 U.S. 99 (1890), involved a \nNavy cadet who, at the time of entering the Naval Academy, \nwas statutorily entitled to serve without removal (except for \ncertain causes) following successful certification.  Id. at 104.  \nBut before the cadet completed his training, Congress passed a \nstatute permitting his early removal.  The Court held that the \ncadet had no โvested interest . . . in his office of which congress \ncould not deprive him.โ  Id.  Crenshaw therefore simply holds \nthat statutory removal restrictions create no vested right against \nCongressโs power to amend the statute. \nButler v. Pennsylvania, 51 U.S. 402 (1850), is similar.  The \nquestion  there  was  whether  any  โvested,  private  personal \nrights,โ id. at 417, were violated when the state legislature \npassed โa subsequent statuteโ reducing the salaries of certain \nappointed officers, id. at 414.  The Court answered in the \nnegative,  finding  โno  limit  upon  the  discretion  of  the \nlegislatureโ to make such alterations.  Id. at 417; see also id. \n \n\n5 \n(noting that terms of office and salaries โare dependent upon \nlegislative discretionโ).   \nCrenshaw and Butler thus support the uncontroversialโ\nand inapplicableโproposition that Congress could amend the \nFederal Reserve Act to remove Cookโs for-cause protection \nwithout running afoul of the Due Process Clause.  See Glidden \nCo. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 534 (1962) (characterizing both \nCrenshaw and Butler as holding only that โneither the tenure \nnor salary of federal officers is constitutionally protected from \nimpairment by Congressโ (emphasis added)). \nThe consequences of concluding that officers with for-\ncause removal protection may invoke due process protections \nare limited, for the simple reason noted above:  Most principal \nofficers are removable at will.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215.  \nIf Cook were too, she would plainly have no interest protected \nby the Due Process Clause.  But Cook enjoys uncontested for-\ncause protection, so she does have such an interest.   \nOne judge of this court previously concluded that the \nSupreme Courtโs due process precedents suggest that an officer \nwith removal protections โwould be constitutionally entitled to \nsome procedural protections before removal.โ  PHH Corp., 881 \nF.3d 75 at 135 n.15 (Griffith, J., concurring in the judgment).  \nFurther, requiring some sort of opportunity to respond would \nnot be anomalous in this context:  The Supreme Court has twice \nstated (though evidently as a matter of statutory interpretation \nrather than constitutional dictate) that if Congress specifies that \nan officer of the United States may be removed only for certain \ncauses,  โthe  officer  is  entitled  to  notice  and  a  hearing.โ  \nShurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 314 (1903); see also \nReagan v. United States, 182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901) (โ[W]here \ncauses  of  removal  are  specified  by  Constitution  or \nstatute, . . . notice and hearing are essential.  If there were not, \n \n\n6 \nthe appointing power could remove at pleasure or for such \ncause as it deemed sufficient.โ).   \n Given that Cook has a property interest in her position, \nshe  is  entitled  to  โsome  kindโ of  process  before  removal.  \nLoudermill, 470 U.S. at 542 (cleaned up).  Before this court, \nthe government does not dispute that it provided Cook no \nmeaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations \nagainst her.  See Cook, 2025 WL 2607761, at *13โ17.  The \ngovernment argues only that Cook โdoes not explain what \ndifference a hearing would have made.โ  Mot. for Stay 19.  \nEven accepting that premise, Cookโs entitlement to process \nstands apart from whether she would succeed in securing a \ndifferent outcome.  See Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 544 (โ[T]he \nright to a hearing does not depend on a demonstration of certain \nsuccess.โ). \nBecause  Cookโs  due  process  claim  is  very  likely \nmeritorious, there is no need to address the meaning of โfor \ncauseโ in the Federal Reserve Act in this emergency posture. \nAs  for  the  equitable  factors,  the  government  relies \nprimarily on the Supreme Courtโs orders in Trump v. Wilcox, \n145 S. Ct. 1415 (2025), and Trump v. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653 \n(2025).  In those cases, the Supreme Court stayed injunctions \nprohibiting the removal of members of the National Labor \nRelations  Board,  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board,  and \nConsumer Product Safety Commission.  The Court suggested \nthat the distinct merits question in those casesโwhether for-\ncause  removal  protections  for  the  officers  at  issue  are \nconstitutionalโwas close.  Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415.  And in \nthat  context,  the  Court  stated  that  โthe  Government  faces \ngreater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer \nto continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully \nremoved  officer  faces  from  being  unable  to  perform  her \nstatutory duty.โ  Id. \n \n\n7 \nThis  case  differs  in  material  respects.    First,  neither \nWilcox, Boyle, nor any similar case involved a constitutional \ndue process claim like Cookโs, on which Cook is likely to \nsucceed.  That difference alters the equitable calculus.  Cookโs \nconstitutional claim suggests only that the President cannot \nremove  her  without  providing  a  constitutionally  adequate \nopportunity to respond.  The harm to the government in this \ncase is better viewed as the inability to remove a for-cause-\nprotected official without following the Due Process Clauseโs \nbasic dictates.  Yet in balancing the equities, we have heldโin \nterms that squarely apply hereโthat the government may not \nโprioritize  any  policy  goal  over  the  Due  Process  Clause.โ  \nKarem v. Trump, 960 F.3d 656, 668 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (quoting \nGordon  v.  Holder,  721  F.3d  638,  653  (D.C.  Cir.  2013)).  \nGranting the governmentโs request for relief when Cook has \nreceived  no  meaningful  process  would  contravene  that \nprinciple.   \nSecond, Cookโs role at the Federal Reserve differs in \nrelevant ways from the role of the officials addressed in Wilcox \nand Boyle.  Most simply, unlike in those cases, the government \ndoes not dispute that Federal Reserve Governors are properly \nprotected from at-will removal.  That distinctive feature of this \ncase matters.  The government cites our observationโin a case \nwhere  the  President  asserted  unfettered  at-will  removal \nauthorityโthat the government may be harmed by relief that \nโrequire[s]  the  President  to  work  with  removed  principal \nofficers.โ  Mot. for Stay 20 (citing LeBlanc v. U.S. Priv. & C.L. \nOversight Bd., 2025 WL 1840591, at *2 (D.C. Cir. July 1, \n2025) (per curiam)); see also Dellinger v. Bessent, 2025 WL \n887518, at *4 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2025) (per curiam) (noting \nโinjury to governmentโ of โhaving to try and unravelโ actions \nby an official the President wishes to remove).  But here, the \ngovernment agrees that the President may not direct the Federal \nReserveโs policy-making decisions, so to the extent he โworks \n \n\n8 \nwithโ members of the Board of Governors it is in a much \ndifferent capacity than in the cases the government cites. \nIt  is  also  not  clear  that  the  Federal  Reserve  wields \nexecutive power โin a similar manner asโ the agencies at issue \nin Wilcox and Boyle.  See Boyle, 145 S. Ct. at 2654.  The Court \nin Wilcox took care to note that โ[t]he Federal Reserve is a \nuniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the \ndistinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the \nUnited States.โ  145 S. Ct. at 1415; see also Consumersโ Rsch. \nv. Consumer Prod. Safety Commโn, 98 F.4th 646, 657 (5th Cir. \n2024) (Oldham, J., dissenting) (โThe Fedโs most important \nresponsibility  is  administration  of  the  money \nsupply, . . . [which] is not an executive function.โ). \nFinally,  Cook  has  been  serving  in  her  position \ncontinuously  despite  the  Presidentโs  purported  termination.  \nGranting the governmentโs request for emergency relief would \nthus upend, not preserve, the status quo.  A stay would itself \nintroduce  the  possibility  of  โthe  disruptive  effect  of  the \nrepeated  removal  and  reinstatementโ  of  Cook  during  this \nlitigation.  Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415. \nGiven  these  unique  circumstances,  and  Cookโs  strong \nlikelihood of success on at least her due process claim, the \ngovernmentโs request for relief is rightly denied.   \n \n\n \nKATSAS,  Circuit  Judge,  dissenting:    The  President \nremoved Lisa Cook from her position as a Governor of the \nFederal Reserve System based on apparent misrepresentations \nCook had made in applying for home mortgages.  The district \ncourt preliminarily enjoined the Federal Reserve Board and its \nChairman from effectuating Cookโs removal.  It held that pre-\nappointment conduct of a federal officer cannot support for-\ncause removal from office.  It also held that Cook enjoys a \nconstitutionally protected property interest in her office.  In my \nview, both holdings are mistaken, and the equitable balance \nhere tips in favor of the government.  So, I would grant the \ngovernmentโs motion for a stay pending appeal. \nI \nThe Federal Reserve Act creates a Board of Governors \nconsisting of seven Governors, each appointed by the President \nand  confirmed  by  the  Senate.    12  U.S.C.  ยง 241.    Federal \nReserve Governors wield substantial power over โthe economy \nas a whole.โ  Fed. Open Mkt. Comm. of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. \nMerrill, 443 U.S. 340, 343โ44 (1979).  Among other things, \nthey serve on the Federal Open Market Committee, 12 U.S.C. \nยง 263(a), which implements monetary policy by buying and \nselling securities to set national interest rates.  See Merrill, 443 \nU.S. at 344.  Pursuant to the Act, Governors serve 14-year \nterms โunless sooner removed for cause by the President.โ  12 \nU.S.C. ยง 242. \nIn  2023,  President  Biden  nominated  and  the  Senate \nconfirmed Lisa Cook to her current term as a Governor.  In \n2025, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency \nreferred to the Department of Justice allegations that Cook \ncommitted mortgage fraud in 2021โsome two years before her \nappointment to her current term.  According to the allegations, \nin June 2021, Cook obtained a $203,000 mortgage to purchase \na  property  in  Michigan  that  she  promised  to  use  as  her \nโprincipal residence for at least one year after the date of \n \n\n2 \noccupancy.โ  ECF No. 1-2 at 2โ3.  A few weeks later, Cook \nallegedly obtained a second, $540,000 mortgage for a property \nin Georgia, which she also promised to use as her primary \nresidence for one year.  Id. at 3.  Mortgages of a primary \nresidence are typically eligible for lower interest rates than are \nother mortgages.  See, e.g., Fannie Mae, Getting It Rightโ\nReverification  of  Occupancy  (June  2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/AM6U-J8WB. \nIn light of these allegations, President Trump removed \nCook for cause under section 242.  The President determined \nthat the allegations against Cook โcall[] into question [her] \ncompetence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.โ  ECF \nNo. 1-4 at 2.  \nCook sued the President, the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System, and its Chairman.  She claimed that \nthe President lacked appropriate โcauseโ to remove her under \nsection 242.  She further claimed a constitutionally protected \nproperty interest in her position as a Governor, thus entitling \nher to adjudicatory process prior to her removal.  Cook moved \nfor a temporary restraining order to pause her removal. \nThe district court construed the TRO motion as one for a \npreliminary  injunction  and  enjoined  the  Board  and  the \nChairman  from  โeffectuatingโ  Cookโs  removal  โin  any \nmanner.โ  ECF No. 28.  The court reasoned that Cook was \nlikely to succeed on both claims.  On the Federal Reserve Act \nclaim, the court held that a for-cause removal requirement does \nnot permit removal for any misconduct committed before the \nofficer was appointed.  Cook v. Trump, No. 25-cv-2903, 2025 \nWL 2607761, at *4โ12 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2025).  On the due-\nprocess claim, the court held that Cook had a constitutionally \nprotected property interest in her office, entitling her  to a \nhearing before she was removed.  Id. at *13โ17.  Finally, the \n \n\n3 \ncourt  found  that  all  the  remaining  preliminary-injunction \nfactors favored Cook.  Id. at *18โ22. \nThe government seeks a stay pending its appeal. \nII \nWe consider four factors in deciding a motion for a stay \npending appeal: whether (1) the government has made a strong \nshowing  that  it  will  prevail;  (2)  the  government  will  be \nirreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) issuance of the stay will \nsubstantially harm Cook or others; and (4) the stay is in the \npublic interest.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 425โ26 (2009).  \nApplying these factors, I would grant a stay. \nIII \nThe government has shown a strong likelihood that it will \nsucceed on both claims at issue. \nA \nCook first alleges that her removal violates the for-cause \nrequirement in the Federal Reserve Act.  The government does \nnot challenge the constitutionality of that requirement, so the \nonly question presented is the meaning of โfor causeโ under \nsection 242.  The Act does not provide Governors with a \nstatutory cause of action to challenge their removals.  Nor does \nthe Administrative Procedure Act afford a cause of action to \nchallenge  actions  by  the  President.    See  Franklin  v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800โ01 (1992).  Accordingly, to \nchallenge her removal under section 242, Cook must satisfy the \ndemanding standards for raising an ultra vires claim.  See \nNTEU v. Vought, No. 25-5091, 2025 WL 2371608, at *18 \n(D.C. Cir. Aug. 15, 2025).  Such a claim โis essentially a Hail \nMary passโ that โrarely succeeds.โ  NRC v. Texas, 605 U.S. \n \n\n4 \n665, 681โ82 (2025).  Among other things, Cook must show \nthat (1) her removal is the product of an โextremeโ legal error \nand (2) she has no other means to seek judicial review.  NTEU, \n2025 WL 2371608, at *18.  As to the first requirement, โ[o]nly \nerror  that  is  patently  a  misconstruction  of  the  Act,  that \ndisregards a specific and unambiguous statutory directive, or \nthat violates some specific command of a statute will support \nrelief.โ  Changji Esquel Textile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, \n722 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (cleaned up).  A government official who \nhas  โmisinterpreted  or  otherwise  evaded  [a]  statutory \nobligationโ may not satisfy this standard.  Nyunt v. Chairman, \nBroad. Bd. of Governors, 589 F.3d 445, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2009) \n(Kavanaugh, J.).  Rather, the error must be โso extreme that one \nmay view it as jurisdictional or nearly so.โ  Griffith v. FLRA, \n842 F.2d 487, 493 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  In my view, Cook cannot \nshow error at all, much less such an extreme error as to warrant \ncorrection through an ultra vires claim.1 \nCookโs claim turns on the meaning of the phrase โfor \ncauseโ  in  section  242.    On  that  question  of  statutory \ninterpretation, our review is de novo.  Blackman v. District of \nColumbia, 456 F.3d 167, 174 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  We read those \nwords according to their โordinary, contemporary, common \nmeaningโ at the time of their enactment.  Sandifer v. U.S. Steel \nCorp., 571 U.S. 220, 227 (2014). \nAs originally passed in 1913, the Federal Reserve Act \nincluded a โfor causeโ removal protection for Board members.  \nPub. L. No. 63-43 ยง 10, 38 Stat. 251, 260.  Congress repealed \nthat requirement in 1933, Pub. L. No. 73-66 ยง 6, 48 Stat. 162, \n \n1  Cook contends that the government forfeited reliance on this \nstandard by not invoking it below.  But she herself pled her section \n242 count as an ultra vires claim, ECF No. 1, at 19, and the district \ncourt granted relief on that claim. \n \n\n5 \n166โ67, but reinserted it in 1935, Pub. L. No. 74-305, ยง 203, \n49 Stat. 684, 704โ05. \nIn 1935, the ordinary meaning of โfor causeโ in the context \nof โthe power of removal from officeโ was simply โsome cause \nother than the will or pleasure of the removing authority, that \nis,  some  cause  relating  to  the  conduct,  ability,  fitness,  or \ncompetence  of  the  officer.โ    For  Cause,  Blackโs  Law \nDictionary (3d ed. 1933).  This meaning was also settled by \n1913.  See For Cause, Blackโs Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1910) \n(โWith reference to the power of removal from office, this term \nmeans  some  cause  other  than  the  will  or  pleasure  of  the \nremoving authority, that is, some cause relating to the conduct, \nability, fitness, or competence of the officer.โ). \nThis broad definition โgive[s] the President more removal \nauthority than other removal provisionsโ imposed by Congress \nor reviewed by the Supreme Court.  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220, 255โ56 (2021).  In particular, it affords the President \nbroader authority than a โgood causeโ requirement, see id., \nwhich itself leaves the President with โample authorityโ to \nremove an official who performs his statutory responsibilities \nincompetently, Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 692 (1988).  \nIt  also  gives  the  President  more  removal  authority  than  a \nrequirement of โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office,โ Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 (cleaned up), a common \nrequirement that commentators have referred to as โINM,โ \nManners  &  Menand,  The  Three  Permissions:  Presidential \nRemoval and the Statutory Limits of Agency Independence, 121 \nColum.  L.  Rev.  1,  4  (2021).    And  in  1935,  Congress \ndeliberately chose a โfor causeโ requirement over the stricter \nINM  requirement  that  was  then  famously  at  issue  in \nHumphreyโs Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), \nand did so in an era when โfor causeโ restrictions were far less \ncommon than INM, see Manners & Menand, supra, at 74โ75. \n \n\n6 \nThe President plainly invoked a cause relating to Cookโs \nconduct,  ability,  fitness,  or  competence.    The  allegations \nagainst Cook could constitute mortgage fraud if she acted \nknowingly, and that is a felony offense.  See 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1014, \n1344.  โ[F]raudโ is an โexcellent reasonโ for removal, not \nmerely a permissible one.  Calcutt v. FDIC, 37 F.4th 293, 338 \n(6th Cir. 2022) (Murphy, J., dissenting), revโd, 598 U.S. 623 \n(2023).  Moreover, even absent intentional misconduct, any \nmisstatements in formal applications for six-figure loans are at \nleast concerning.  And the President specifically concluded that \nthe  allegations  cast  doubt  on  Cookโs  โcompetence  and \ntrustworthiness as a financial regulator.โ  ECF No. 1-4 at 2.  \nThat is plainly a permissible โcauseโ under section 242. \nThe district court took a different approach.  It concluded \nthat pre-appointment misconduct cannot satisfy this modest \nโfor causeโ requirement.  Cook, 2025 WL 2607761, at *10.  \nEven Cook did not urge that positionโand for good reason.  \nImagine a Governor who amassed his great wealth and stellar \nreputation based on financial fraud discovered only after he \ntook office.  Imagine a Governor who is discovered to have \nbribed  a  Senator  to  ensure  confirmation.    Or  imagine  a \nGovernor who is discovered to have committed murder before \ntaking office.  Such pre-appointment acts clearly would relate \nto the โconduct, ability, fitness, or competence of the officerโ \nfor the office. \nThat is enough for the government to succeed on Cookโs \nsection 242 claim.  The district court did not presume to review \neither the factual support for, or motive behind, the cause \narticulated by the President.  Cook, 2025 WL 2607761, at *9 \nn.8, *12 nn.9โ10.  Asserting that power would have raised a \nhost of difficulties.  Normally, courts do not look behind a \nfacially valid justification to probe the mental states of the \nPresident, see Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 702โ04 (2018), \n \n\n7 \nor even Cabinet officials, see Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. \n753, 769 (1972); United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 422 \n(1941).  Nor do they normally assess evidentiary sufficiency on \nultra vires review, see Changji, 40 F.4th at 726, or in the \ncontext of removals, see Keim v. United States, 177 U.S. 290, \n295โ96  (1900).    But  those  questions  are  not  currently \npresented.  On the section 242 claim, the district court rested \nits likelihood-of-success determination entirely on the legal \nproposition that pre-appointment conduct cannot support a for-\ncause removal.  As that position is untenable, the government \nis likely to succeed in appealing it. \nB \nThe  government  is  also  likely  to  succeed  on  Cookโs \nprocedural due process claim. \nโThe  first  inquiry  in  every  due  process  challenge  is \nwhether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest \nin property or liberty.โ  Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 \nU.S. 40, 59 (1999) (cleaned up).  Cookโs claim is that the \nFederal Reserve Act creates the relevant property interest, to \nwhich  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment \nattaches.  See Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. \n564, 577 (1972).2 \nThe Supreme Court has long held that โpublic offices are \nmere agencies or trusts, and not property as such.โ  Taylor v. \nBeckham, 178 U.S. 548, 577 (1900).  In Taylor, the Court \napplied that principle to reject a due-process claim resting on \n \n2  Cook also claimed that the Act gave her a statutory right to \nadjudicatory process prior to her termination.  The district court did \nnot  pass  on  that  claim,  so  it  cannot  support  the  preliminary \ninjunction. \n \n\n8 \nan  alleged  property  interest  in  the  governorship  of  the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.  See id.  The Court explained:  \nโThe view that public office is not property has been generally \nentertained in this country.โ   Id. at 576.  The Court cited \nCrenshaw v. United States, 134 U.S. 99 (1890), which had held \nthat โan officer appointed for a definite time, or during good \nbehaviorโ had no โvested interest or contract right in his officeโ \nas against congressional override.  Id. at 104; see Taylor, 178 \nU.S. at 576โ77 (discussing Crenshaw).  Finally, the Court in \nTaylor concluded that โthe nature of the relation of a public \nofficer to the public is inconsistent with ... a property ... right.โ  \nId. at 577. \nCook invokes more recent, new-property cases tracing to \nRoth and Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970).  In particular, \nshe invokes Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 \nU.S. 532 (1985), which held that a state statute protecting civil-\nservice  employees  from  removal  absent  โmisfeasance, \nmalfeasance, or nonfeasance in officeโ created a property right \nprotected by due process and thus entitled such employees to a \nhearing prior to any termination.   See id. at 538โ39, 545.  \nLoudermill has been extended to federal โcareer appointee[s]โ \nas well, based on removal protections afforded by the Civil \nService Reform Act.  See Esparraguera v. Depโt of the Army, \n101 F.4th 28, 30โ31 (D.C. Cir. 2024). \nCook, however, is no mere civil-service employee who is \nโpart  of  the  broad  swath  of  โlesser  functionariesโ  in  the \nGovernmentโs workforce.โ  Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 \n(2018) (cleaned up).  She is an โOfficer[] of the United Statesโ \nwithin  the  meaning  of  the  Appointments  Clause  of  the \nConstitution, U.S. Const. Art. II, ยง 2, cl. 2; see Lucia, 585 U.S. \nat 245.  And not just any officer, but a principal officer, who \nmust be appointed by the President with the advice and consent \nof the Senateโand who is supervised by nobody except the \n \n\n9 \nPresident.  See U.S. Const. Art. II, ยง 2, cl. 2; United States v. \nArthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 14 (2021).  She serves as a Federal \nReserve Governor and a member of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, both of which wield significant power over the \nnationโs economy.  In my view, she is much more akin to the \nGovernor  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky  than  to  the \nsecurity guard who was the plaintiff in Loudermill or the career \nattorney in the Senior Executive Service who was the plaintiff \nin Esparraguera.  As a principal officer of the United States, \nshe serves in a position of public โtrustโ that creates no property \nrights.  See Taylor, 178 U.S. at 576โ77. \nMy colleagues acknowledge that principal officers of the \nUnited States generally have no property right in the offices \nthat they occupy.  But, they say, Cook is different because she \nis a most unusual principal officerโone who is not removable \nat will.  In my view, that consideration does not distinguish \nTaylor.  After all, even at the time of Taylor, the Governor of \nKentucky had a state constitutional entitlement to serve for a \nfixed term of four years.  Ky. Const. ยง 72 (1891).  And he could \nbe removed from office only in the extremely unlikely event of \nimpeachment  in  the  state  house  of  representatives  and \nconviction by a supermajority in the state senate.  Id. ยงยง 68โ70.  \nIn that respect, his tenure was at least as secure as that of an \nappointed officer who may be removed for cause. \nIn any event, the employee-property cases would not help \nCook even if they were extended to principal officers.  These \ncases recognize that an employee has some legitimate claim of \nentitlement and thus a property right.  But as Judge Easterbrook \nhas explained:  โIf there is such a claim, we must ask: in what? \nWhat, particularly, is the โpropertyโ in a public job?  Is it the \nemoluments of the office, the official power of the office, or \nthe honor of it all?โ  Thornton v. Barnes, 890 F.2d 1380, 1392 \n(7th Cir. 1989) (Easterbrook, J., concurring).  Does one โโownโ \n \n\n10 \na public office as private โpropertyโ?โ  Id.  Of course not.  The \nemployee-removal  cases  do  not  upend  the  commonsense \nintuition that one does not have a โprivate propertyโ right to \nwield โ[g]overnmental powersโ in our democratic system of \ngovernment.  Id.   \nFor these reasons, Cook does not have a property interest \nin her position, so the government is likely to succeed in \ndefending against her procedural due process claim.3 \nIV \nThe remaining factors also counsel in favor of a stay.  \nWhen โthe government is the party sought to be enjoined, the \npublic  interest  and  balance  of  equities  factors  merge.โ  \n \n3    Even  if  Cook  did  have  some  property  interest  in  her \nemployment as a Federal Reserve Governor, I doubt that she would \nbe entitled to a pre-removal hearing as a matter of due process.  In \nfinding such a due-process right in Loudermill, the Supreme Court \nnoted that removed civil-service employees may depend on regular \nincome from their jobs and thus be forced โonto the welfare rollsโ if \nwrongfully terminated.  470 U.S. at 544.  One suspects that is not the \ncase for principal officers of the United States in generalโor for \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve Board in particular.  Moreover, the \nCourt  in  Loudermill  discounted  the  governmentโs  need  for \nimmediate  termination  given  the  possibility  of  suspending \nemployees  with  pay  during  the  pendency  of  a  pre-termination \nhearing.  See id. at 544โ45.  But the President has no option to \nsuspend principal officers of the United States with pay, particularly \nthose with fixed terms like Federal Reserve Governors.  See 12 \nU.S.C. ยง 242.  These considerations suggest that, under the interest-\nbalancing required by Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), a \nprincipal officer may not be entitled to a pre-termination hearing \neven if a civil-service employee is.  Because this issue was neither \nbriefed nor decided below, I merely flag it here. \n \n\n11 \nMediNatura, Inc. v. FDA, 998 F.3d 931, 945 (D.C. Cir. 2021).  \nSo I consider them together. \nIn cases involving the Presidentโs removal of principal \nofficers, โthe Government faces greater risk of harm from an \norder allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the \nexecutive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from \nbeing unable to perform her statutory duty.โ  Trump v. Wilcox, \n145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (2025).  That is why the Supreme Court \nhas  recently  stayed  preliminary  injunctions  preventing  the \nPresident  from  removing  members  of  the  National  Labor \nRelations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission.   See id.; Trump v. \nBoyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025).  Those cases involved \nremovals without cause.  But the harm to the government is \nsurely  magnified  where  the  removal  is  based  not  on  the \nPresidentโs policy preferences, but on serious accusations of \nmisconduct that โcall[] into questionโ an officerโs โcompetence \nand trustworthiness.โ  ECF No. 1-4 at 2.  And although Wilcox \nflagged  a  distinct  question  whether  the  Governors  of  the \nFederal Reserve System could be removed at will, 145 S. Ct. at \n1415, that bears only on an Article II question not presented \nhere.  It does not suggest that the balancing of harms should \ncome out any differently. \nCook contends that her position, as a Governor of the \nFederal Reserve System, is singularly important in American \ngovernment.  In Collins, the Supreme Court declined to peg the \nmerits  of  its  removal  jurisprudence  to  an  individualized \nassessment of the relative importance of agencies such as the \nConsumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau  and  the  Federal \nHousing Finance Agency.  594 U.S. at 251โ53.  The Court \nstressed the โsevere practical problemsโ with making such \ncomparative judgments.  Id. at 252.  Given those problems, we \nshould also be reluctant to distinguish between, say, the Board \n \n\n12 \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the National \nLabor Relations Board in the equitable-balancing aspect of our \nremoval jurisprudence.  Moreover, the Board of Governors no \ndoubt is important, but that only heightens the governmentโs \ninterest  in  ensuring  that  its  Governors  are  competent  and \ncapable  of  projecting  confidence  into  markets.    And  in \nempowering the President to remove Governors for cause, \nCongress has specifically assigned that task to the President. \nMy colleagues suggest that the nature of Cookโs claim \ndiminishes the importance of the government interests at stake.  \nThey reason that a procedural due process claim would not \ndisable the President from removing a Governor, but only \nwould require some adjudicatory process first.  Perhaps in \ntheory.    But  if  a Governor could  demand  a  constitutional \nentitlement to adjudicatory process prior to her removal, she \nalso could enlist the judiciary to review the adequacy of that \nprocess.  Even with substantial expedition, judicial review can \nfrustrate presidential action for months or even years.  See, e.g., \nTrump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 676โ82.  And that would enable \na potentially compromised Governor to engage in significant \ngovernmental actionโsuch as voting on whether to adjust \ninterest rates, which Cook says she must do tomorrow.  \nOn Cookโs side of the balance, nothing distinguishes this \ncase from the interests of the removed officials in Wilcox and \nBoyle.  The district court flagged the loss of Cookโs ability to \nserve in her โhigh-ranking, public-servant role.โ  Cook, 2025 \nWL 2607761, at *20.  But the same was true for those other \nofficials, and yet the Supreme Court held that this did not \noutweigh  the  competing  injuries  to  the  government.    See \nWilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415; Boyle, 145 S. Ct. at 2654; accord \nDellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5052, 2025 WL 887518, at *4 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2025) (per curiam).  Moreover, wrongly \nremoved federal officials generally may obtain their salary \n \n\n13 \nthrough suits for backpay, see Humphreyโs Exโr, 295 U.S. at \n618, which further undercuts the need for enjoining the effect \nof a presidential removal order. \nV \nFor these reasons, I would grant the governmentโs stay \nmotion.  As my colleagues deny the motion, I respectfully \ndissent. \n ",

Even if the Presidentโs determination were \nreviewableโand over a century of caselaw suggests it is notโreview would \nbe limited to the rigorous standard for ultra vires claims. Cook does not \nargue that she meets that standard, nor could she. The district courtโs \nconclusion that โcauseโ excludes pre-confirmation conduct finds no \nsupport in text or precedent, and even Cookโs counsel did not advocate for \nthat standard below.  \nCookโs due-process claim is equally meritless. We are aware of no \ncase extending due-process protections for employees to principal officers \nof the United States, and nothing in the text of 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 purports to \ndo so. That makes good senseโunlike โcivil servantsโ who generally do not \nwield โsignificant authority,โ Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, \n506 (2010), principal officers help the President discharge constitutional \nduties and wield significant executive power, Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 \nU.S. 197, 203-04 (2020). Requiring the President to afford them a โformal \nevidentiary hearingโ (Op. 38) before removal is untenable. And even if \nCook had a property interest in her office, she still has provided no basis to \nbelieve that a hearing would have made a difference. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 6 of 18\n \nARGUMENT \nI.   The Presidentโs โCauseโ Determination Is Not Subject \nto Judicial Second-Guessing \nA. When a statute gives a power of removal โfor cause,โ without any \nspecification of the causes, the removal decision โis a matter of discretion \nand not reviewable.โ Reagan v. United States, 182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901); see \nMot. 8-9. Cook asserts (Opp. 6) that Reaganโs non-reviewability holding \napplies only to offices without fixed terms. But the sentence above did not \nrely on the petitionerโs lack of a fixed term. And there is no reason to think \nthe Presidentโs discretionary determination of what constitutes cause is any \nmore amenable to judicial review simply because it concerns an officer with \na fixed term. This Court has confirmed as much by holding that a fixed term \nof office โis a ceiling, not a floor, on the length of service,โ Severino v. \nBiden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 2023)โso a fixed term alone confers \nno removal protection at all. Accord Parsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324, \n335, 343 (1897) (similar). \nEven if Reagan were factually distinguishable, Cook does not refute \nthe contemporaneous treatise announcing the same rule or the series of \nstate-court decisions demonstrating that courts broadly understood the \n2 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 7 of 18\n \npower to remove for โcauseโ was discretionary and unreviewable.1  \nB. At minimum, Cook would have to show that the President acted \nultra vires. Accord Compl. ยถ 66 (alleging that removal was โultra vires and \na clear violation of lawโ). Cook has identified no statutory cause of action, \nand her objection is that the President exceeded his statutory authority. The \nonly available form of judicial review is therefore an ultra vires claim. See \nFederal Express Corp. v. U.S. Depโt of Commerce, 39 F.4th 756, 763 (D.C. \nCir. 2022).  \nCook argues that Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), \nmeans review is not limited to ultra vires review. But Wiener was a suit for \nbackpay; that is wholly different from a โnonstatutory reviewโ suit โseeking \ninjunctive reliefโโin other words, what is โcommonly known as an ultra \nvires claim.โ Federal Express, 39 F.4th at 763.  \nThis Court has made clear that ultra vires claims are reserved for \ninstances of โextremeโ error; action that is โโpatently a misconstruction of \nthe Act, that disregards a specific and unambiguous statutory directive, or \nthat violates some specific command of a statute.โ Changji Esquel Textile \n \n1 Montgomery H. Throop, A Treatise on the Law Relating to Public Officers \nยง 396, at 387 (1892); see also, e.g., United States ex rel. Garland v. Oliver, 6 \nMackey 47, 53, 56 (D.C. 1887); Trimble v. People, 34 P. 981, 985 (Colo. 1893); \nCity of Hoboken v. Gear, 3 Dutch. 265, 288 (N.J. 1859); People v. Stout, 19 \nHow. Pr. 171 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Gen. Term 1860) (opinion of Sutherland, J.). \n3 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 8 of 18\n \nCo. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 722 (D.C. Cir. 2022).2 Cook must show that \nthe President โhas plainly and openly crossed a congressionally drawn line \nin the sand.โ Federal Express, 39 F.4th at 765; see also Nuclear Regulatory \nCommโn v. Texas, 605 U.S. 665, 681 (2025).  \nWhile Federal Express and Changji Esquel considered challenges to \nagency, not residential, action, that difference if anything makes Cookโs \nburden even higher. Even assuming presidential action is subject to an \nultra vires claim, โreview must be exceedingly deferentialโ given the \nโPresidentโs discretion in exercising core Article II responsibilities.โ \nAmerican Foreign Service Association v. Trump, 2025 WL 1742853, at *2 \n(D.C. Cir. June 20, 2025) (granting stay pending appeal). \nThe governmentโs reading is far from โutterly unreasonable,โ Federal \nExpress, 39 F.4th at 766, it is correct. And the Presidentโs determination \nthat Cookโs financial misrepresentation constituted sufficient cause for \nremoval is both an unreviewable exercise of the discretion Congress vested \nin him, see Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 477 (1994), and eminently \n \n2 Cook suggests that the government waived reliance on the ultra \nvires standard by raising it for the first time on appeal. But Cook pled \nCount I of her complaint as an ultra vires claim and the government \nresponded that there was no โclear-cut abuse of discretion warranting \njudicial intervention.โ Dkt. 23 at 5. In all events, ultra vires is the only \npossible cause of action given the lack of a statutory review provision.  \n4 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 9 of 18\n \nreasonable, as it concerns whether Cook can be trusted to act with \nforthrightness, care, and disinterest in managing the U.S. money supply. \nII.   The District Court Misconstrued โFor Causeโ \nUnder any standard, an apparent misrepresentation in loan \ndocuments that garners a financial benefit to the applicant is enough to \njustify removing someone from a senior financial regulatory role. โ[F]or \ncauseโ in its ordinary usage clearly encompasses such a determination, and \nnothing in the statute forbids consideration of misconduct that concerns a \npersonal matter, that occurs at a certain time, or that may not result in a \ncriminal conviction. \nThe district court erred when it imposed additional restrictions on the \nPresidentโs removal power that do not appear in the statutory text. Neither \nthe statute nor the contemporaneous 1933 Blackโs Law Dictionary \ndefinition of the term โfor causeโ contains an โin officeโ limitation. See 12 \nU.S.C. ยง 242; Blackโs Law Dictionary 796 (3d ed. 1933) (defining โfor \ncauseโ); but see Op. 13-19. โIt is a fundamental principle of statutory \ninterpretation that โabsent provision[s] cannot be supplied by the courts.โโ \nLittle Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 \nU.S. 657, 677 (2020) (quoting Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019)). \nThat โprinciple applies not only to adding terms not found in the statute, \n5 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 10 of 18\n \nbut also to imposing limits on an agencyโs discretion that are not supported \nby the text.โ Id. In construing โfor causeโ to be limited to only conduct \noccurring โin office,โ the court โalter[ed], rather than [] interpret[ed]โ the \nstatute. Id.  \nIn defending the district courtโs narrow interpretation, Cook misses \nthree dispositive points. First, โ[a]textual judicial supplementation is \nparticularly inappropriate when, as here, Congress has shown that it knows \nhow to adopt the omitted language or provision.โ Rotkiske, 589 U.S. at 14. \nCongress, in both contemporaneous statutes and those enacted since, \nexpressly included an โin officeโ limitation, see e.g., 15 U.S.C. ยง 41 \n(โmalfeasance in officeโ); 29 U.S.C. ยง 153 (same).3 Yet Congress instead \nchose โfor causeโ for the Federal Reserve Act. โFor causeโ contemplates a \nbroader range of considerations because it is not limited to โin-officeโ \ngrounds. The inference the district court drew from its survey of the U.S. \nCode was backwards, reading in limitations that Congress knew how to \nimpose but did not.  \nSecond, Cookโs insistence that โfor causeโ is synonymous with \n \n3 See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. ยงยง 1202(d), 1211(b), 7104(b); 12 U.S.C. \nยง 5491(c)(3); 26 U.S.C. ยง 7443(f); 29 U.S.C. ยง 661(b); 30 U.S.C. ยง 823(b)(1); \n38 U.S.C. ยง 7101(b)(2); 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 5841(e), 7171(b)(1), 7412(r)(6)(B); 45 \nU.S.C. ยง 154; 46 U.S.C. ยง 46101(b)(5); 49 U.S.C. ยงยง 1111(c), 1301(b)(3). \n6 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 11 of 18\n \nnarrower formulations (Opp. 9-10) ignores that the Supreme Court has \nspecifically contrasted these provisions, noting that โfor causeโ โappears to \ngive the President more removal authority than other removal provisions.โ \nCollins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 255-56 (2021) (emphasis added). And \nprecedent dating back centuries is in accord. Indeed, the district courtโs \ncategorical exclusion of any pre-office misconduct from the domain of \nโcauseโ is refuted by the cases Cook cites (Opp. 10-11), which make clear \nthat pre-confirmation misconduct can constitute โcauseโ for removal \nwhere, as here, it bears on the officerโs fitness to serve. \nThird, the district courtโs limiting construction of โcauseโ would \nprohibit the President from removing a principal officer when there is \nunrebutted evidence of serious misconduct bearing on her fitness for office. \nOn the district courtโs theory, the President could not remove a Board \nGovernor who was revealed to have committed massive financial fraudโ\nprovided it happened before confirmation. That cannot be right. And such a \nview would raise substantial questions under Article II.  \nFor all these reasons, Cookโs counsel was correct below to disclaim \nthe categorical rule adopted by the district court. Hrโg Tr. at 17:10-25 (Aug. \n29, 2025). Cookโs position below was that pre-office misconduct could be \ngrounds for removal, depending on careful balancing of factors, including \n7 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 12 of 18\n \nseverity, timing, and relevance to the office. See id. But the district court \nacknowledged that it would not second-guess the Presidentโs discretionary \nweighing of such factors, Op. 26 n.9, and instead adopted a bright-line rule \nurged by neither party. \nFinally, to the extent Cook suggests that the President removed her \nbased on a policy disagreement relating to interest rates, that was not the \nbasis of the district courtโs injunction and is incorrect. The Presidentโs letter \nmade clear that he was acting based on her โdeceitful and potentially \ncriminal conductโ in connection with the mortgage agreements. The Court \nshould decline โto probe the sincerity of the [Presidentโs] stated \njustificationsโ for an action when the President has identified a facially \npermissible basis for it. Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 702 (2018); see \nalso American Foreign Serv. Assโn, 2025 WL 1742853, at *3 (explaining \nthat Hawaii did not โinspectโ the Presidentโs โrationaleโ). \nIII.   Cookโs Due-Process Claim Fails \nA โpublic office is not propertyโ and Cookโs role as a principal officer \nโto the public is inconsistent with either a property or a contract right.โ \nTaylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548, 576-77 (1900). Cookโs reliance on \nReagan and Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311 (1903), is misplaced, as \nboth cases concerned a statutory right to notice and a hearing, not the \n8 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 13 of 18\n \nconstitutional right on which the district court relied.4 And both cases \nupheld the removal of officers who did not receive a hearing. Nor does \nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), help Cook, as it concerned \nMarburyโs โright to [a] commissionโ to demonstrate his appointment to an \noffice, id. at 172-73, not whether he held a property interest in his office.  \nCookโs due-process argument fundamentally rests on her view that \nthe property interest that tenured employees have in their jobs applies with \nfull force to principal executive officers of the United States. Opp. 13. She \ncites no case that has so held. And her theory fundamentally \nmisunderstands the purpose of removal restrictions. Congress has enacted \nstatutory removal restrictions for various officers to ensure that they โact \n* * * independently of executive control,โ and โexercise [their] judgment \nwithout the leave or hindrance of any other official.โ Humphreyโs Executor \nv. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 629 (1935). Congress did not, in enacting \nrestrictions for these purposes, confer on principal officers an individual \nproprietary interest in their office.  \n \n4 Cook does renew her argument that the Federal Reserve Act entitled \nher to notice and a hearing before removal. But the district court did not \nadopt that argument. Op. 27-28. Nor should this Court. Congress knows \nhow to confer these procedural protections and has done so elsewhere. See, \ne.g., 5 U.S.C. ยง 7104(b); 22 U.S.C. ยง 4135(d); 29 U.S.C. ยง 153(a); 38 U.S.C. \nยง 7101(b)(2); 5 U.S.C. ยง 7521(a). It did not extend those protections to \nmembers of the Board of Governors. \n9 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 14 of 18\n \nAnd there is no basis to extend cases considering property interests \nheld by civil servants in their employment to the fundamentally different \nduties owed by constitutional officers to the citizenry. The Appointments \nClause โcares not a whitโ about employees but controls the appointment of \nofficers who wield โsignificant authority.โ Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 \n(2018). โThe people do not vote for the โOfficers of the United States,โโ Free \nEnterprise, 561 U.S. at 497-98, who maintain their connection to the public \nthrough the Presidentโs oversight. A stake in the office for their own \npersonal benefit is unsupported by precedent and incompatible with \nconstitutional structure. \nIn any event, Cook has not shown that a hearing would have made a \ndifference. Even assuming she is right to insist that she was not required to \nbring any defense to the Presidentโs attention between August 20 (when the \nPresident put her on notice) and August 25 (when he effectuated the \ntermination), she was requiredโas an, โessential elementโ of her due-\nprocess claimโto identify what material facts were in dispute. Codd v. \nVelger, 429 U.S. 626, 627 (1977). Cook has failed to do so. She has no \nanswer to Codd and has provided no explanation for the contradictory \nrepresentations apparent on the face of her mortgage agreements, see Dkt. \n1-4 at 1, and that alone is grounds to stay the extraordinary equitable relief \n10 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 15 of 18\n \nshe secured below.  \nIV.  The Remaining Factors Support A Stay \nMerits aside, the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear that โthe \nGovernment faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed \nofficer to continue exercising the executive powerโ than the removed officer \nfaces from a stay. Trump v. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025); accord \nOrder, LeBlanc v. U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, No. \n25-5197 (D.C. Cir. July 1, 2025). Cook points out that the Court reserved \nwhether the Federal Reserve removal restrictions might be constitutional \neven if other removal restrictions for executive officers are not. But that is a \ndistinction going to the merits (and the constitutional issue has not even \nbeen presented here). On the equities, the Supreme Courtโs determinations \nin Wilcox and Boyle apply equally here. \nCook asserts that the equities balance differently here because she \nsupposedly โhas been continuously servingโ since the Presidentโs removal. \nOpp. 20. Assuming that were true, that only underscores the need for a \nstay, because, as the Supreme Court has emphasized, the โGovernment \nfaces greater risk of harm from * * * allowing a removed officer to continue \nexercising the executive powerโ than the harm to the removed officer from \na stay. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. at 2654. \n11 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 16 of 18\n \nThe rest of Cookโs arguments on the equitable factors rest on the \nnotion that her removal reflects a โdesire to change policy at the Federal \nReserve,โ thus implicating the value of Federal Reserve independence. Opp. \n19. The district court did not issue its injunction on that basis, however, Op. \n27 n. 10, and it provides no basis to deny a stay. The public and the \nExecutive share an interest in ensuring the integrity of the Federal Reserve, \nand that requires respecting the Presidentโs statutory authority to remove \nGovernors โfor causeโ when such cause arises. \n \n12 \n\nUSCA Case #25-5326      Document #2134769            Filed: 09/14/2025      Page 17 of 18\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should stay the district courtโs injunction.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n  BRETT A.

A few months ago, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the importance of that \nstatutory protection, emphasizing its long and distinct historical pedigree.  The Fed, \nthe Court explained, is โa uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the \ndistinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.โ \nTrump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. 1415 (2025).  President Trumpโs attempted removal of \nGovernor Lisa Cook, if allowed, would mark an immediate end to that history.  And \nit would send a destabilizing signal to the financial markets that could not be easily \nundone.  \nThe  government  does  not  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  the  statutory \nremoval protection guaranteeing the Boardโs independence. Yet it nevertheless asks \nthis Court, on an emergency basis, to render that protection meaningless by reducing \nfor-cause removal to a โmatter of discretionโ that is โnot reviewableโ by any court. \nMot. at 1 (quoting Reagan v. United States, 182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901)).  And, worse \nstill, the government asks the Court to abdicate its role in a case in which the \nattempted removal was announced without affording any notice or opportunity to be \nheardโcontrary to both the statute and constitutional due process.  That would \ntransform the Federal Reserve from a historically independent institution into an at-\n1 \n \n\nwill body, leaving the nationโs central bank (and its monetary policy) at the mercy \nof the White House and its political whims. \nThat  is  the  opposite  of  what  Congress  intended.  And  it  is  therefore  the \nopposite of what the law requires. โFor cause,โ as a matter of black-letter law and \ncommon sense, โdoes not mean the same thing as โat will.โโ Collins v. Yellen, 594 \nU.S. 220, 256 (2021) (alteration adopted).   \nThis Court can leave for another day any hard questions about the precise \nscope  of  a  Presidentโs  for-cause-removal  authority.    Under  any  plausible \nformulation, this removal is not for cause. First, the accusations against Governor \nCook concern private, out-of-office conduct that was either known or knowable by \nthe Executive and   Legislative   branches   in   considering   Governor   Cookโs   \nnomination   and confirmation.  Second, Governor Cook has never been found guilty \nofโor  even  been  formally  charged  withโany  wrongdoing.  Third,  even  the \nunsubstantiated accusations against Governor Cook are vague and incompleteโ\nindeed, the government concedes (Mot. 1) that it does not know Governor Cookโs \nโmens  rea  when  making  the  representationsโ  at  issue.    Fourth,  the  President \npurported to terminate Governor Cook only after expressing disagreement with her \npolicy views. \nEven setting aside the weakness of its position on the merits, the government \ncannot meet its burden, as a proponent of a stay, to show that the traditional equitable \n2 \n \n\nstay factors favor its requested relief. Unlike the plaintiffs in other recent removal \ncases before this Court, Governor Cook has continued to serve in her position while \nher lawsuit is pending.  \nA stay by this Court would therefore be the first signal from the courts that \nour system of government is no longer able to guarantee the independence of the \nFederal Reserve. Nothing would then stop the President from firing other members \nof the Board on similarly flimsy pretexts. The era of Fed independence would be \nover. \nThe risks to the nationโs economy could be dire.  Central banks like the \nFederal Reserve are independent for a reason: Even the perception of political \ninfluence can destroy the investor confidence that is essential for economic growth \nand stability.  And that bell cannot be unrung.  Once confidence in the bankโs \nindependence is lost, it cannot easily be regained.  The result, as the experience of \nother countries has shown, is spiraling interest rates and economic disaster.  The \ngovernment  presents  no  interest  sufficient  to  justify  imposing  potentially  dire \nconsequences on the national economy by rushing to grant relief that cannot be \nundone.  This Court should affirm the decision of the district court and consider this \ncase on the merits in an orderly manner that fully preserves the status quo.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nIn 1913, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. As \n3 \n \n\noriginally enacted, the FRA provided that Federal Reserve Board members could be \nremoved by the President only โfor cause.โ  Id.  That for-cause removal provision \nwas briefly rescinded after the Supreme Courtโs decision in Myers v. United States, \n272 U.S. 52 (1926), then reinstated less than a decade later.  \n  Governor Cook is serving a 14-year term set to expire in 2038.  On August \n20, 2025, Federal Housing Finance Agency (โFHFAโ) Director Pulte posted on X a \nscreenshot of a referral letter to the Department of Justice alleging that Governor \nCook โappearsโ to have claimed two different homes as her main residence in 2021 \nto โpotentiallyโ get lower interest rates and better loan terms. Though the referral \nletter was dated five days earlier, neither the FHFA nor the DOJ had given Governor \nCook notice of the allegation prior to Director Pulteโs social media post. Just thirty \nminutes after Director Pulte posted on X, President Trump posted on Truth Social: \nโGovernor Cook must resign, now!!!โ \n  Five days later, President Trump posted a two-page letter on Truth Social \npurporting to fire Governor Cook from the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve,  โeffective  immediately,โ  relying  on  the  unsubstantiated  allegation  in \nDirector Pulteโs letter.  Governor Cook was not provided any opportunity to address \nor correct the unsubstantiated claims leveled against her by Director Pulte and \nPresident Trump.1       \n \n1 The governmentโs motion repeatedly mischaracterizes the Presidentโs stated basis \n4 \n \n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  A stay pending appeal is an โextraordinaryโ remedy.  Citizens for Resp. & \nEthics in Washington v. FEC, 904 F.3d 1014, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam).  \nAs the movant, the government must show (1) โstrongโ likelihood of success, (2) \nirreparable injury, (3) that a stay will not โsubstantially injure the other parties,โ and \n(4) that a stay favors the public interest.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 \n(2009).  \nI.  The  Presidentโs  โCauseโ  Determination  is  Subject  to  Judicial \nReview.  \nThe governmentโs motion begins (at 9) with a sweeping argument: that no \ncourt may review the Presidentโs โfor causeโ determination here.  But in Wiener v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), the Supreme Court had no difficulty recognizing \nthe  availability  of  judicial  review  for  implied  for-cause  removals.   Id.  at  356 \n(rejecting the claim that for-cause removal permits a President to remove an officer \nโmerely because he wanted his own appointeesโ).  If that is true, it must undoubtedly \nbe true for express for-cause removals as well.  See Op. at 12 (explaining that \n \nfor attempting to remove Governor Cook.  What began as purported termination for \nwhat โappearsโ as โgross negligenceโ and lack of โcompetence and trustworthinessโ \n(Compl. Ex. C) has turned into โevidence of apparent mortgage fraudโ (Mot. 5), \nโfinancial misconductโ (id. 11), and โfinancial fraudโ (id. 13, drawing analogies to \nBernie Madoff, Charles Ponzi). The bases that the government offers for her removal \nnow are not what the President claimed in the record.  And civil papers seeking \nemergency relief to preserve her job status are not the proper place to rebut the \nunderlying and inaccurate accusations leveled against Governor Cook. \n5 \n \n\nโwhether the President has even provided a legally permissible cause . . . is clearly \nreviewableโ).2   \nEven so, the government insists that Reagan v. United States, 182 U.S. 419 \n(1901) cuts against that view.  According to the government, when a statute permits \nโremoval for cause,โ that โโis a matter of discretion and not reviewable,โ at least if \nthe โcauses are not definedโ by the statute.โ  ECF 13 at 7 (quoting Reagan, 182 U.S. \nat 425).  That is wrong.  \nIn  Reagan,  the  Supreme  Court  considered  whether  judicial  review  was \navailable for certain judicially appointed commissioners without fixed tenure who \nwere, under their authorizing statute, removable โfor causes prescribed by law.โ  Id. \nat 424.  It held that such commissioners were not entitled to judicial review.  Id. at \n425.  But in the course of deciding that question, the Court explicitly recognized that \njudicial  review  is  available  for  those  officers  (like  Federal  Reserve  Board \nGovernors) serving fixed terms.  Id. at 425.  The Court specified that judicial review \nwas available where โcauses of removal are specified by Constitution or statute, as \nalso where the term of office is for a fixed period.โ  Id.  Reagan explained that, for \n \n2 Although the district court found it declined to inquire into the sufficiency of the \nevidence presented by the President because his โstated cause falls outside the causes \npermissible under the statute,โ Op. at 12 n.9, the sufficiency of evidence is subject \nto judicial review.  If it were not, the President could remove members of the Board \nby baselessly accusing them of whatever crimes he invented, so long as those crimes \nrelated to in-office conduct. \n6 \n \n\nofficers serving under a โfixed periodโ term of office, โnotice and hearing are \nessential. If there were not, the appointing power could remove at pleasure or for \nsuch cause as it deemed sufficient.โ  Id.  Reagan thus forecloses the governmentโs \ncontention that under the FRA, a โcauseโ determination must be left to the President \nand President alone. \nThat understanding dates back centuries. Lev Menand & Jane Manners, The \nThree  Permissions:  Presidential  Removal  and  the  Statutory  Limits  of  Agency \nIndependence, 121 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 5 (2021) (โSince before the Founding, offices \nheld for a term of years, in the absence of constitutional or statutory language to the \ncontrary, were designed to be inviolable.โ).  And, were there any doubt, Marbury v. \nMadison โemphaticallyโ made this clear. 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 (1803) (holding \nthat judicial  review is available  to  adjudicate  a fixed-tenured  officerโs  right to \noffice). \n  Wiener also disposes of the governmentโs reliance on the ultra vires standard \nas requiring Cook to demonstrate that the president acted โcontrary to a specific \nprohibition  in  the  statute.โ    Mot.  at  10  (internal  quotations  and  citations \nomitted).  Weiner establishes that for-cause removal does not permit a President to \nremove an officer โmerely because he wanted his own appointees.โ  357 U.S. at \n356.   If  the  Court  could  review  that  contention,  it  can  review  this  one.    The \ngovernment further errs in urgingโfor the first time on appealโthe applicability of \n7 \n \n\nthe โclear and mandatoryโ standard of Changji Esquel Textile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 \nF.4th 716, 722 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  That standard applies where there is a โstatutory \npreclusion of review.โ  Id.  The government makes no such claim here, and this \nCourt has long rejected the governmentโs argument โthat there are no judicially \nenforceable limitations on presidential actions, besides actions that run afoul of the \nConstitution  or  which  contravene  direct  statutory  prohibitions,  so  long  as  the \nPresident claims that he is acting pursuant toโ a statute.  Chamber of Commerce of \nU.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1332 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \nII.  The is Government is Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nA.  โFor Causeโ Does Not Mean โAt Will.โ \n  The  governmentโs  interpretation  of  โfor  causeโ  removal  would  turn  the \nFederal Reserve into an at-will body.  That position is flawed as a statutory matter: \nโโfor causeโ does not mean the same thing as โat will.โโ  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220, 256 (2021) (alteration adopted).  And it fails to appreciate the Federal Reserveโs \nstatus as a โuniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct \nhistorical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.โ  Trump v. \nWilcox, 145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (2025).   \nB.  The  Presidentโs  Attempt  to  Remove  Governor  Cook  was \nWithout โCauseโ \n1.  The District Court Correctly Concluded that Pre-\nOffice Conduct Does Not Constitute Cause. \nThe government insists that Governor Cookโs allegedly wrongful conduct \n8 \n \n\nprior to taking office satisfies the for cause removal standard. But the historical \nmeaning of โfor causeโ belies that argument.  โFor causeโ removal protection has \nlong been anchored to โthe Humphreyโs Executor standard of โinefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office.โโ  Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting \nOversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 487 (2010).  While considering the 1935 amendment \nthat reinstated โfor causeโ removal protection for Board Governors, Congress made \nthe affirmative decision to wait for the Supreme Courtโs decision in Humphreyโs \nExecutor before finalizing the language of the act.  See Gary Richardson & David \nW. Wilcox, How Congress Designed the Federal Reserve to be Independent of \nPresidential Control, 39 J. of Econ. Perspectives 3, 229 (2025).  \nIn May 1935, the Court published Humphreyโs Executor, which confirmed the \nconstitutionality of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office (โINMโ) \nremoval restrictions, expressly holding that Congress had the authority to โforbid \nthe[] removalโ of certain officers by the President โexcept for cause.โ 295 U.S. at \n629 (emphasis added).  Three months later, Congress passed the Banking Act of \n1935 to provide that the President could not remove Board members except โfor \ncause.โ  12 U.S.C. ยง 242.  Congress used โfor causeโ rather than โINMโ to restore \nthe 1913 language of the FRA, which took for granted that โfor causeโ meant INM. \n  Apart from INM, no other statutorily enumerated grounds for presidential \nremoval of executive officers existed in the U.S. Code at the time of the FRAโs \n9 \n \n\nenactment in 1913.  Today, other provisions of the U.S. Code contain specific \ngrounds  for  presidential  removal  of  government  officials,  but  those  additional \ngrounds for removal were not statutorily enumerated at the time of the FRAโs \noriginal enactment, and they cannot be incorporated after-the-fact into the statute.  \nIn  1935,  the  only  statutorily  enumerated  grounds  for  presidential  removal  of \nexecutive officers were INM (see Manners & Menand, 121 Colum. L. Rev. at 72โ\n73 app. A, B), confirming that Congress intended removal โfor causeโ to be limited \nto that standard.    \nTo the extent that removal โfor causeโ extends beyond INM, the district court \ncorrectly held that such grounds must be โin-office conduct that is closely related to \nthe INM grounds.โ  Op. at 19.  The canonical English case Rex v. Richardson, 1 \nBurrows, 517, 538 (1758), informed American courtsโ view about what category of \nnon-office (including pre-office) conduct amounted to removable cause at the time \nof the FRAโs enactment.  That category of offenses was vanishingly small.  It \nincluded only misconduct โ(1) Such as have no immediate relation to his office, but \nare in themselves of so infamous a nature, as to render the offender unfit to execute \nany public franchise.โ State ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. McLain, 58 Ohio St. 313, 320 (1898) \n(quoting Rex v. Richardson, 1 Burrows at 538) (emphasis added).  In the decades \nsurrounding the FRAโs enactment, no fewer than eight state supreme courts cited \n10 \n \n\nRex v. Richardson in defining removable cause.3   \n  The government asserts โthe district court had no problem confirming that the \nPresident would have cause to remove Cook if she was convicted of mortgage fraud \nbased on her conduct before taking officeโ and insists โcriminal conviction is not a \nprerequisite for removal under 12 U.S.C. ยง 242.โ  Mot. at 2.  But the district court \ndid  not  suggest  that  conviction  was  a  prerequisite  for  removal  nor  was  it \ncontradicting its pre- versus post-office distinction.  What the district court correctly \nnoted was that โwhere an officer is convicted of a serious crime and incarcerated \nwhile in office . . . [s]uch a conviction would obviously interfere with the ability of \nan officer to effectively and faithfully carry out their in-office duties,โ or in other \nwords, neglect of duty.  Op. at 21โ22 (emphasis added).4    \nC.  Governor  Cook  Was  Deprived  of  Her  Statutory  and \nConstitutional Rights to Notice and an Opportunity to Be \nHeard.  \n  Even assuming that the Presidentโs stated reasons could satisfy the โfor causeโ \nstandard, his purported firing of Governor Cook would still be unlawful. That is \n \n3 See id.; ECF 17 at 12 (collecting cases).  \n4 Instead of looking to the history, statutory context and precedent establishing โfor \ncauseโ protection as a term of art anchored to the โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance  in  officeโ  standard  established  in  Humphreyโs  Executor,  the \ngovernment continues to rely exclusively on dictionary definitions to advance its \npreferred reading of โcause.โ  That interpretive approach is incorrect, and as the \ndistrict court pointed out, it even fails on its own terms.  See Op. at 9โ10.  \n11 \n \n\nbecause Governor Cook was deprived of her statutory right to notice and a hearing \nunder both the FRA and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n  The district court did not evaluate whether the FRAโs for-cause removal \nprovision afforded Governor Cook the right to notice and a hearing, as it concluded \nthat the Due Process Clause provided an independent source of that right. But the \nSupreme Court has made clear that for-cause removal provisions like the FRAโs \nestablish a statutory right to notice and a hearing before an official may be removed.   \n  The critical cases are Reagan and Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311 \n(1903).  Reagan recognized a โruleโ that โwhere causes of removal are specified by \nconstitution or statute, as also where the term of office is for a fixed period, notice \nand hearing are essential.โ  182 U.S. at 425.  Shurtleff reiterated that rule, writing (in \nthe context of an INM statute) that โif the removal is sought to be made for those \ncauses, or either of them, the officer is entitled to notice and a hearing.โ  189 U.S. at \n314.5   \nTogether, Shurtleff and Reagan require notice and a hearing when a President \nseeks to remove an official with for-cause-removal protections.  The governmentโs \n \n5 Both Reagan and Shurtleff involved statutes dealing with federal officers, not \nemployees, and the officer in Shurtleff was a principal officer.  No hearing was \nnecessary in Reagan because Congress had not specified any causes, see supra \nSection I.A, or in Shurtleff because the Court held that the officer, who had no fixed \nterm, could be removed for causes other than those specified in the statute, see 189 \nU.S. at 317.   \n12 \n \n\nattempt to rewrite this โwell-settledโ rule fails.  PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, \n135 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Griffith, J., concurring) (citing Reagan and Shurtleff).  The \ngovernment asserts that one has no statutory right to notice and a hearing unless \nthose specific protections are โvery clear and explicit,โ and that Governor Cook is \nnot entitled to notice and a hearing because the FRA does not use the words โnotice \nand a hearing.โ  ECF 13 at 19.  But neither did the statutes in Shurtleff or Reagan, \nand so the governmentโs distinction of those cases is no distinction at all.      \nThe same conclusion follows from the Due Process Clause.  As an officer with \nfor-cause removal protection, Governor Cook has a property interest in her position.  \nโA  property  interest  exists  if  the  employee  can  be  removed  only  for  cause.โ \nEsparraguera v. Depโt of the Army, 101 F.4th 28, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (citations and \nquotations  omitted).  The  Governmentโs  sole  response  is  to  claim  that  because \nGovernor Cook is an officer of the United States, not โa mere public employee,โ she \nโha[s] no property interest in her public office and was thus owed no notice or \nopportunity to be heard.โ  Mot. at 18.  But no case the government cites comes close \nto recognizing that distinction.  \nFirst, the governmentโs theory is foreclosed by the foundational precedent of \nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803).  Marbury, which considered the \nvalidity  of  William Marburyโs appointment as justice  of the  peaceโan  officer \nposition requiring Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation makes plain \n13 \n \n\nthat the critical distinction regarding a property right is whether the holder of a \nposition serves at will, not whether she is an officer or employee.  As Chief Justice \nMarshall explained:  \n[W]hen the officer is not removable at the will of the executive, the \nappointment is not revocable, and cannot be annulled. It has conferred \nlegal rights which cannot be resumed.  \n \nId. at 162 (emphases added).  \nThe cases the government cites in support of its proposed โofficer/employeeโ \ndistinction lend no support to its theory.  Rather, those cases stand for the proposition \nthat โneither the tenure nor salary of federal officers is constitutionally protected \nfrom impairment by Congress.โ Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 534 (1962) \n(emphasis added).  That conclusion is entirely consistent with the notion that PAS \nofficers with for-cause removal protection enjoy a property interest in their positions.  \nAs the Court put it in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, โproperty \ninterests are not created by the Constitution, they are created and their dimensions \nare defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent \nsourceโ such as a statute.  470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985) (internal citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  The โstatute . . . creates such an interest.โ  Id.  Thus, by repealing \nor amending the very statute that gives rise to a property rightโhere, the Federal \nReserve Actโa legislature could eliminate that right.  But the Fifth Amendment \nprevents the President from unilaterally terminating a property right conferred by \n14 \n \n\nstatute.  \nThe governmentโs other cases are even further afield.  Crenshaw v. United \nStates  held  only  that  an  employeeโa  cadet  midshipman  without  โfor  causeโ \nremoval protectionโlacked โany vested interest or contract right in his office of \nwhich congress could not deprive him.โ  134 U.S. 99, 104 (1890) (emphasis added).  \nCrenshaw is thus inapposite for multiple reasons.  Taylor v. Beckham, 178 US 548 \n(1900), and Baker v. Carr, 369 US 186 (1962), considered whether candidates for \nelected officeโnot PAS officers with for-cause removal protectionsโhad a property \nright to โpublic office.โ  Baker, 369 U.S. at 232.  Governor Cook is not a losing \ncandidate for office; she is a public official protected by removal only for cause.   \n  Governor Cook was deprived of a forum in which to offer any evidence.  The \ngovernment seems to blame her for that shortcoming, stating she never โsought to \noffer any evidence . . . that would explain her actions.โ  Mot. at 19.  It cannot be the \ncase that deprivation of due process is harmless unless the person informally raises \nher arguments ahead of the proceeding to which she is entitled.6 \nIII.  The Remaining Factors Favor Governor Cook.  \n \n6 The complete property records reveal the opposite. See, e.g., Fed Governor Lisa \nCook claimed 2nd residence as โvacation home,โ undercutting Trump fraud claims, \nAssoc. Press (Sept. 12, 2025), https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-lisa-cook-\ntrump-852820c83e5001ec3b6e2d14047965c9 (affirming, based on the review of \nbank documents, that Governor Cook designated her Atlanta property for use as a \nโVacation Homeโ). \n15 \n \n\n  The  Federal  Reserveโs  independenceโeven  and  especially  from  the \nPresidentโis a result of intentional Congressional design, the wisdom of which has \nborne  out  over  decades.    The  governmentโs  argument  challenges  all  of  that, \nthreatening the stability and predictability of economic markets worldwide.7  The \nequitable factors weigh heavily against a stay, which would undermine more than a \ncentury of the Federal Reserveโs independence and have dire repercussions for the \neconomy.  \n  As  Justice  Kavanaugh  previously  observed,  it  โmay  be  worthwhile  to \ninsulateโ the Board โfrom direct presidential oversight or controlโ because of the \nBoardโs โpower to directly affect the short-term functioning of the U.S. economy by \nsetting interest rates and adjusting the money supply.โ  Separation of Powers During \nthe Forty-Fourth Presidency and Beyond, 93 Minn. L. Rev. 1454, 1474 (2009).  The \npublicโs โbelie[f] that the central bank is free from interference and that the law \n[governing the bank] is unlikely to change swiftlyโ is crucial for ensuring economic \nstability.  Cristina  Bodea  &  Raymond  Hicks,  Price  Stability  and  Central  Bank \nIndependence, 69 Intโl Orgs. 35, 38 (2015). \n \n7 โEven the perception that monetary-policy decisions are politically motivated, or \ninfluenced by threats that policy makers wonโt be able to serve out their terms of \noffice, can undermine public confidence . . .โ Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Ben \nBernanke & Janet Yellen, America Needs an Independent Fed, Wall St. J. (Aug. 5, \n2019),  https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-needs-an-independent-fed-\n11565045308.  \n16 \n \n\n  The governmentโs argument threatens that.  Granting a stay (allowing the \nremoval  of  Governor  Cook)  would  harm  Congress,  which  โhas  an  interest  in \nensuring that Federal Reserve Board members are removed for only statutorily \npermitted reasons, and preventing the President from thwarting the very ends which \nCongress sought to realize by definitively fixing the term of office.โ  Op. at 47 \n(internal quotation marks and alterations removed).  It would harm the public, which \nhas an interest in requiring the executive branch to โabide by the federal laws that \ngovern their existence and operations.โ  League of Women Voters of United States \nv. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  And as economists have warned, \neveryday  Americans  ultimately  would  pay  the  price:  higher  prices  โvia  higher \ninflation and higher interest ratesโ that result โwhen central bank independence is \nlost.โ8 \n  Those profound risks to the financial markets are imminent. At all times \nduring this litigation, Governor Cook has been performing her duties as a duly \nnominated and confirmed member of the Board. Critically, Governor Cookโs duties \nhave  included  preparing  for  next  weekโs  Federal  Open  Market  Committee \n(โFOMCโ) policy meeting, at which she and other FOMC members will review the \nFederal Reserveโs monetary policy, issue statements on market outlook, and vote on \n \n8 Ian Smith, Emily Herbert & Kate Duguid, Donald Trumpโs Attack on Fed Shifts \nMarket  Bets  on  Interest  Rates  and  Inflation,  Fin.  Times  (Aug.  26,  2025), \nhttps://www.ft.com/content/d8a8d068-18ba-4e29-a69f-6c155ffc67f3. \n17 \n \n\nsetting interest rates.  A stay pending appeal would threaten Governor Cookโs \nparticipation in next weekโs meeting and potentially plunge the FOMCโs operations \ninto turmoil.  The government offers no justification to explain why this Court \nshould sanction such a severe disruption of the status quo.  \n  The government spares only a sentence to acknowledge the catastrophic effect \nthat undermining the independence of the Federal Reserve Board is sure to have on \nthe economy.  Mot. at 23.  But the governmentโs failure to acknowledge the problem \nwill not make it go away.  Over the past several months, as President Trump has \nthreatened the Federal Reserveโs independence, markets have reacted quickly and \nsharply.9  Throughout this litigation, Governor Cook has continued to serve in her \nrole, so a grant of a stay from this Court would be the first signal from the courts that \nher  removal  may  be  lawful.    This  Courtโs  interventionโparticularly  before  it \ncarefully  considers  the  merits  of  the  governmentโs  argument  and  all  of  its \nrepercussionsโwould thus cause needless confusion in a sensitive economic area.  \nAnd once the credibility of the Federal Reserve as an independent body is damaged, \nit will not easily be restored. \n  In claiming that it would be irreparably injured if it does not receive a stay \n \n9 See Polo Rocha, Trumpโs Criticism of Powell Is Shaking Marketsโ Faith in Fedโs \nIndependence, Investopedia (Apr. 21, 2025), https://www.investopedia.com/trump-\ncriticism-of-powell-is-shaking-markets-faith-in-federal-reserve-independence-\n11719211. \n18 \n \n\nhere, the government relies exclusively (Mot. at 20) on cases involving officials \nwhom  the  President  asserts he has unilateral power  to  remove.    But here,  the \ngovernment expressly disclaims any such constitutional argument.  Mot. at 4โ5.  The \ngovernment cannot and does not explain why the President is irreparably harmed \nhere when the Federal Reserve continues to operateโas Congress intendedโfree \nfrom direct presidential control.  The governmentโs irreparable harm arguments \nmerely reinforce the Presidentโs desire to change policy at the Federal Reserve by \neffectuating the removal in an emergency litigation posture. \n   In particular, the governmentโs reliance on Trump v. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653 \n(2025) and Trump v. Wilcox is misplaced.  Though the factors in those cases weighed \nin  favor  of  the  government,  the  Supreme  Court  specifically  disclaimed  the \napplicability of those cases to this one.  The Court acknowledged that โ[t]he Federal \nReserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct \nhistorical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,โ unlike the \nConsumer Product  Safety  Commission or  the  National Labor  Relations  Board.  \nWilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415.  The Court explained further that its decision in Wilcox \ndid not โimplicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members \nof the Federal Reserveโs Board of Governors.โ  Id.  And it followed that statement \nby warning lower courts that โinterim ordersโ like the one issued in Wilcox tell lower \ncourts how they โshould exercise [their] equitable discretion.โ  Boyle, 145 S. Ct. at \n19 \n \n\n2654.10  Taking those statements together can only mean thatโgiven the Federal \nReserveโs historical independenceโthe stay factors cash out differently when it \ncomes to the removal of a Federal Reserve Board member than they did in Wilcox \nand Boyle.   \nNor can the government successfully argue that Governor Cook would not be \nirreparably harmed by her removal from the Board.  Indeed, the governmentโs claim \nthat it needs relief in advance of the September 16 FOMC meeting (Mot. at 4) cannot \nbe squared with its assertion that Governor Cook has no โclear and present needโ \n(Mot. at 22) to participate as a duly appointed governor of the Federal Reserve \nBoard.  The very fact of that meeting confirms that even a temporary absence from \nthe Board would irreparably injure Governor Cookโs ability to participate as a \ngovernor.  See Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974).  And to be clear, \nGovernor Cook is not asking to be reinstatedโshe has been continuously serving in \nher Senate-confirmed role.  Moreover, President Trump has made clear that he \nintends to and can fill Governor Cookโs seat by the time even an expedited resolution \nof this case could occur.  If a stay is granted, there may be no seat to which Governor \n \n10 The governmentโs suggestion (Mot. at 20 n.2) that courts lack equitable authority \nto โreinstate[]โ Governor Cook cannot be squared with the general rule that, when \ncourts find a presidential action unlawful, they can โenjoin the officers who attempt \nto enforce the Presidentโs directive.โ  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 828 \n(1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  And, again, \nGovernor Cook has remained in office and the governmentโs motion seeks to change \nthat.  \n20 \n \n\nCook  could  return  if  she  prevails  on  the  meritsโfurther  demonstrating  the \nirreparable harm she faces.   \n  The government also fails to offer any sort of stopping point or limiting \nprinciple to its argument. If this Court accepts the governmentโs argument, the \nPresident would be given the power to make unsubstantiated charges for any type of \nalleged misconduct to remove any other member of the Board.  At a time when the \nPresident is publicly pressuring the Chair of the Federal Reserve to adopt his favored \nmonetary policy, any signal from the courts that the Federal Reserveโs independence \nis in jeopardy risks unsettling markets. This moment calls for orderly process and \nsober deliberationโnot a destabilizing rush to judgment. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Appellantโs motion should be denied.  \n \nSeptember 13, 2025    Respectfully Submitted, \n          /s/ Abbe David Lowell \nAbbe David Lowell  \nDavid A.

Cook seeks an emergency temporary restraining \norder  to  prevent  implementation  of  President  Trumpโs  August  25,  2025  Truth  Social  post \nunlawfully purporting to remove her from her position as a Federal Reserve Board Governor.  The \nPresidentโs effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside \nattack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System. As one editorial described, \nit represents a blatant โgrab for power in defiance of the nationโs laws, and if it succeeds, it will be \nto the detriment of the nationโs interests.โ2 \n  Governor Cook is likely to succeed on the merits of her claims that President Trumpโs \npurported firing violated her statutory and constitutional rights.  If the Presidentโs unlawful decree \nwere allowed to stand, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System would be forced to \neffectuate President Trumpโs unlawful attempted termination of Governor Cook, in violation of \nboth the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. ยง 242) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  Governor Cook will succeed at showing irreparable harm, as President Trumpโs \nunprecedented actions threaten her Senate-confirmed position on the Board, and her ability to \nfulfill her duty to promote maximum employment and price stability.  Finally, the equities and \npublic interest both weigh in favor of keeping Governor Cook in her position, as her purported \nfiring would jeopardize the independence of the Federal Reserve, and ultimately, the stability of \nour nationโs financial system.   \nAccordingly, Governor Cook moves for an immediate TRO (1) declaring that President \nTrumpโs August 25, 2025 attempted firing of Governor Cook is unlawful under the Federal \nReserve Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and that Governor Cook is still \n \n2  Editorial,  Whereโs  Your  Evidence,  Mr.  President?,  N.Y.

The Structure and History of the Federal Reserve Act Illustrate the Importance \nof the Independence of the Federal Reserve.  \n  The Federal Reserve System was established by the Federal Reserve Act (โFRAโ) in 1913 \nto provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system.  \nAs articulated by the Supreme Court in Trump v. Wilcox, โ[t]he Federal Reserve is a uniquely \nstructured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and \nSecond Banks of the United States.โ  145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (May 22, 2025) (citing Seila Law LLC \nv. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 222 n.8 (2020)).  The intent that the \nFederal Reserve retain independence has been reinforced by statutory amendments to the FRA in \n1935, 1977, and 2010. \nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is the seven-member governing body of \nthe Federal Reserve Systemโmade up of the chairperson plus six Governorsโresponsible for \nsetting monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, and maintaining financial stability. The \nGovernors, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, serve staggered 14-\nyear terms.  The long and staggered term procedure reinforces the independence of the Board. \nAn independent and credible Federal Reserve is essential for a stable economy, as the short-\nterm political interests of a president often clash with sound monetary policy.  An independent \ncentral bank acts predictably and transparently, which stabilizes markets and the wider economy. \n2 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 7 of 28\nA politically insulated Board of Governors can make appropriate, albeit unpopular, decisionsโ\nsuch as raising interest rates to combat inflationโthat are crucial for the nationโs long-term \nfinancial health. \nThe independence of the Federal Reserve is supported by several statutory provisions that \nshield the Board of Governors from political interference.  Such statutory provisions intended to \ninsulate the Board of Governors from outside influence include: the Boardโs funding outside the \nannual appropriations process;3 the Boardโs authority to set all terms and conditions of Board \nemployment;4 the  Boardโs  exemption  from  Government  Accountability  Office  audits  of  its \nmonetary policy decisions;5 the Boardโs authority to litigate independently;6 the Boardโs ability to \npresent  legislative  recommendations  and  testimony  to  Congress  without  executive  branch \napproval;7 the exemption of the Boardโs monetary policy decisions from the Congressional Review \nAct;8 and the Boardโs authorization to participate directly in certain international fora without \nexecutive branch intermediation.9  \n \n3 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. ยงยง 243, 244. \n4 12 U.S.C. ยง 244. \n5 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. ยง 3910 (exempting from GAO audits of the Board and Reserve Banks, inter \nalia, discussions or communications relating to monetary policy matters, transactions under the \ndirection of the FOMC, or transactions with foreign central banks); 31 U.S.C. ยง 714(b) (same).  \n6  See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. ยง 248(p). \n7 12 U.S.C. ยง 250 (prohibiting any โofficer or agency of the United Statesโ from requiring the \nBoard โto submit legislative recommendations, or testimony, or comments on legislation, to any \nofficer or agency of the United States for approval, comments, or review, prior to . . .  submitting \nthem to Congressโ). \n8 5 U.S.C. ยง 807 (exempting โrules that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the \nBoardโ and FOMC from the Congressional Review Act).   \n9 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. ยง 3907(b)(3)(C), 12 U.S.C. ยง 3911, 12 U.S.C. ยง 5373(c), 22 USC ยง 9522 \nnote.  \n3 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 8 of 28\nII.  The Federal Reserve Actโs โFor Causeโ Removal Provision Protects the \nIndependence of the Board of Governors.  \nThe crucial independence of the Board of Governors is guarded by the Federal Reserve \nActโs โfor causeโ removal provision, which prevents the President from firing a Governor except \nfor instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable conduct.  The \nFRA expressly provides that \nUpon the expiration of the term of any appointive member of the Federal \nReserve Board in office on August 23, 1935, the President shall fix the term \nof  the  successor  to  such  member  at  not  to  exceed  fourteen  years,  as \ndesignated by the President at the time of nomination, but in such manner \nas to provide for the expiration of the term of not more than one member in \nany two-year period, and thereafter each member shall hold office for a term \nof fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless \nsooner removed for cause by the President. \n \n12 U.S.C. ยง 242 (emphasis added).  \nIn Humphreyโs Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and Wiener v. United \nStates, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of such \nstatutory protections for government officials serving on multi-member agencies.  In Humphreyโs \nExecutor,  the  Court  found  that  Congress  has  the  authority  to  restrict  Presidential  removal \nโdepend[ing] upon the character of the office.โ Id. at 631. Specifically, the Court held โfor causeโ \nremoval restrictions were deemed constitutional with respect to officers at the FTC; in reaching \nthis conclusion, the Court noted the FTCโs structure as (a) โa body of experts,โ (b) with long, \nstaggered terms, (c) that was designed to be โnonpartisanโ and act โwith entire impartiality.โ   Id. \nat 624โ25.  \nThe Supreme Court recently made clear that the analysis in Humphreyโs Executor applies \nwith particular force to the Federal Reserve.  In a case about the Presidentโs removal of a member \nof the National Labor Relations Board (โNLRBโ) and a member of the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard (โMSPBโ), the Court permitted the removals to take effect but specifically distinguished \n4 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 9 of 28\nthe removal protections for Federal Reserve Governors.  As the Supreme Courtโs decision in \nTrump v. Wilcox makes clear, the Federal Reserveโs structural safeguards function to preserve the \nhistorical tradition of an independent central bank.  145 S. Ct. at 1415.  The โfor causeโ statutory \nremoval provision provided by the FRA is essential to protecting this independence. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n    Governor Cook is a distinguished economist with a background in academia, policy, and \nresearch.  She holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, with a focus \non macroeconomics and international economics.  She received a BA in philosophy from Spelman \nCollege. As a Marshall Scholar, she received a second BA in philosophy, politics, and economics \nfrom Oxford University. \n    Prior to her appointment to the Board, Governor Cook was a professor of economics and \ninternational relations at Michigan State University, a research associate at the National Bureau of \nEconomic  Research,  a  member  of  the  faculty  of  Harvard  Universityโs  Kennedy  School  of \nGovernment, and a National Fellow at Stanford University, among other academic positions. She \nserved as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama \nfrom August 2011 to August 2012.  She was a senior adviser on finance and development in the \nU.S. Department of Treasuryโs Office of International Affairs from September 2000 to September \n2001. \n    She has previously directed the American Economic Associationโs Summer Program for \ndisadvantaged students from 2018 to 2021 and was elected a member of the American Economic \nAssociationโs Executive Committee in 2019. \n5 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 10 of 28\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  On January 14, 2022 President Joseph R. Biden nominated Governor Cook to fill an \nunexpired seat on the Board of Governors ending in January 2024.  She was confirmed by the \nSenate on May 10, 2022 and thereafter began serving on the Federal Reserve Board, based in \nWashington D.C.  She was subsequently renominated by President Biden and confirmed by the \nSenate in September 2023 for an additional, full 14-year term as Governor.  Governor Cook is the \nfirst Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserveโs Board in its 111-year history. \n    President Trump has repeatedly chastised the Federal Reserve for refusing to lower interest \nrates, posting on Truth Social that the โFed should cut Rates by 3 Pointsโ and should โBring down \nthe Fed Rate, NOW!!!โ10  As recently as August 19, 2025, President Trump posted on Truth Social, \nโCould somebody please inform Jerome โToo Lateโ Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, \nvery badly?  People canโt get a Mortgage because of him.  There is no Inflation, and every sign is \npointing to a major Rate Cut. โToo Lateโ is a disaster!โ11 \n    President Trump has threatened to fire Chairman Powell for being unwilling to cut interest \nrates and he has publicly demanded that Chairman Powell resign.12  On August 1, 2025, President \nTrump posted on Truth Social, โโToo Lateโ Powell should resign, just like Adriana Kugler, a Biden \nAppointee, resigned.  She knew he was doing the wrong thing on Interest Rates. He should resign, \nalso!โ13 \n \n10 Eric Revell, Trump says Federal Reserve should lower interest rates by 3 points, Fox Bus.

The committee consists of the Federal Reserve chairperson, the other six members \nof the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York president, and four other \nregional Federal Reserve System presidents on a rotating basis, who represent districts across the \ncountry.  In 2025, at each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Governor Cook has \nvoted with Chairman Powell in electing not to lower short-term interest rates.   \nOn August 15, 2025, Federal Housing Finance Agency (โFHFAโ) Director William \nPulteโusing social media as the vehicle to publicize his actionsโsent a referral letter to Attorney \nGeneral Pamela Bondi and Department of Justice Special Attorney Edward Martin, Jr., accusing \nGovernor Cook of mortgage fraud.  Director Pulteโs letter alleged that Governor Cook โappearsโ \nto have claimed two different homes as her main residence in 2021 to โpotentiallyโ get lower \ninterest rates and better loan terms.   Director Pulte publicly released his referral letter on August \n20, 2025, without notice to Governor Cook.14  Governor Cook was never provided with any \nopportunity to respond to the allegations before the referral was made to DOJ.   \nThe same day that Director Pulte publicly released the referral letter to DOJ, President \nTrump posted on his Truth Social page, โCook must resign, now!!!โ and linked a Bloomberg news \nstory about Director Pulteโs referral letter.15  Two days after Director Pulte released his referral \nletter, President Trump stated he would fire Governor Cook if she did not resign, telling reporters, \nโ[w]hat she did was bad. So Iโll fire her if she doesnโt resign.โ16 \n \n14  Bill  Pulte  (@pulte),  X  (Aug.  20,  2025,  8:05  AM), \nhttps://x.com/pulte/status/1958138434171629636. \n15  Donald  J.

Especially that infraction because sheโs in charge \nof, if you think about it, mortgages, and we need people that are 100 percent above-board, and it \ndoesnโt seem like she was.โ18  Governor Cook was never provided any opportunity to address or \ncorrect the unsubstantiated claims leveled against her by Director Pulte and President Trump. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nTo obtain a temporary restraining order, a movant must demonstrate โ(1) [she] is likely to \nsucceed on the merits; (2) [she] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief; (3) the balance of equities tips in [her] favor; and (4) the issuance of a preliminary injunction \nis in the public interest.โ Alpine Sec.

Governor Cook Has a Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits. \nA.  Defendants Violated the Federal Reserve Act.  \n Defendants violated the FRA by attempting to remove Governor Cook without any \ncognizable โcauseโ under 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. The โfor causeโ removal protection guaranteed by the \nFRA, which has been the bulwark of the Federal Reserveโs independence for most of the past \ncentury, prevents the President from firing a Federal Reserve Board member except for โcause,โ \nmeaning inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct. But here, \nthe President has relied on a thinly-veiled pretext in an attempt to remove Governor Cook over her \nunwillingness to lower interest rates.  And even if the President had been more careful in obscuring \nhis real justification for targeting Governor Cook, the rationale that the President concoctedโan \nunsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook โmay haveโ or โseemsโ to have erred in filling out \na mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizenโdoes not amount to โcauseโ for removal \nwithin the meaning of the FRA. There is no conceivable interpretation of โfor causeโ removal \nprotection that would allow the President to fire Governor Cook, either for his true motive or the \npretextual one he has invented.  \nThe prevailing understanding of โfor causeโ removal protection has long been anchored to \nโthe Humphreyโs Executor standard of โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.โโ \nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 487 (2010) \n(quoting Humphreyโs Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 620 (1935)).  To be sure, the FRA \ndoes not expressly define โfor cause.โ19  But the context surrounding the FRAโs 1935 overhaul \n \n19 In interpreting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionโs governing act, which also does \nnot define cause, the Supreme Court and this Court have assumed the applicability of the \nโinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in officeโ standard.  See Free Enterprise Fund, 561 \n \n9 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 14 of 28\nindicates  that  โfor  causeโ  must  be  interpreted  with  the  โinefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in officeโ (โINMโ) standard of Humphreyโs Executor as a benchmark. Congress \nmodified the FRA to insert the phrase โfor causeโ as part of the Banking Act of 1935, which the \nSenate debated at the same time the Supreme Court was hearing argument in Humphreyโs \nExecutor.  See Gary Richardson & David Wilcox, How Congress Designed the Federal Reserve \nto be Independent of Presidential Control, 39 J. of Econ. Persp. 221, 229 (2025).  โSenators and \nwitnesses discussed [Humphreyโs Executor and Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926)] . . . . \nMost thought . . . the Senate should wait for the court to hand down its decision in Humphreyโs \nExecutor before finalizing the language in the [Banking Act of 1935] legislation.โ  Id.  \nUltimately, Congress did wait for the Court before amending the FRA. In May 1935, the \nCourt published its decision in Humphreyโs Executor, which confirmed the constitutionality of \nINM removal restrictions, expressly holding that Congress had the authority to โforbid the[] \nremovalโ of certain officers by the President โexcept for cause,โ 295 U.S. at 629 (emphasis added). \nThree months later, Congress passed the Banking Act of 1935 to provide that the President could \nnot remove Federal Reserve Board members except โfor cause.โ 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. Because \nCongressโs fundamental understanding of โcauseโ in 1935 was informed by the INM protections \nat  issue  in  Humphreyโs  Executor,  โfor  cause,โ  within  the  meaning  of  the  FRA,  should  be \ninterpreted to encompass only INM and similar misconduct.  \nThe unsubstantiated allegations leveled against Governor Cook do not amount to any \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, and the President has not claimed otherwise.  \nNor do they constitute comparable misconduct. The INM standard refers to a confined set of \n \nU.S. at 487; SEC v. Bilzerian, 750 F. Supp. 14, 16 (D.D.C. 1990) (citation omitted) (โ[I]t is \ngenerally accepted that the President may remove a commissioner for inefficiency, neglect of duty, \nor malfeasance in office.โ). \n10 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 15 of 28\noffenses that are entirely distinct from the conduct of which Governor Cook has been accused. \nโWhen Congress first used the now-talismanic INM phrase in 1887, it defined these circumstances \nusing  terms  that  were  already  well-known.โ    Jane  Manners  &  Lev  Menand,  The  Three \nPermissions: Presidential Removal and the Statutory Limits of Agency Independence, 121 Colum. \nL. Rev. 1, 6 (2021). โInefficiencyโ was a term โto describe wasteful government administration \ncaused by inept officers who gained their positions through political connections rather than \nmerit.โ Id. โNeglect of duty indicated instances of โnonfeasanceโโa failure to perform oneโs duties \nin a way that caused injury to others.โ  Id.  And malfeasance in office โreferred to a wrongful act \ncommitted in the execution of oneโs duties that caused injury to others.โ Id. (emphasis added).   \nThe INM standard historically โgave the President removal power, not so the President \nmight direct the commissions, but so there would be a ready alternative to impeachment.โ Id. at 7. \nCongress intended to create removal protections for term-limited officers that resembled those \nafforded to judges serving with life tenure.  โThis was how judges and scholars understood removal \nstatutes when the Court decided Humphreyโs Executor.  And this was how legislators continued to \nunderstand these provisions when they drafted the Federal Reserve Act.โ  Id.  Plainly, โthe law \nwas not designed to permit the President to remove the heads of independent agencies for \ninefficiency or neglect of duty if they do not follow presidential policy directives or if they depart \nfrom the Presidentโs agenda.โ  Id. at 8.  But President Trump seeks permission to do just that: \nremove Governor Cook because she has departed from his agenda over interest rates.20  \n \n20  Even  if  the  Presidentโs  authority  to  remove  a  Board  member  โfor  causeโ  encompasses \ncircumstances beyond โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,โ the President does \nnot have the power to unilaterally define โcauseโ and conclude, without evidence, that he has found \nit. Jane Manners and Lev Menand, the leading scholars in this realm, have asserted that โfor causeโ \nlanguage โis best interpreted to encompass any of the recognized removal causes contained in the \nU.S. Code, including INM, immorality, ineligibility, offenses involving moral turpitude, and \nconviction of a crime.โ Manners & Menand, The Three Permissions: Presidential Removal and \n \n11 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 16 of 28\nThe Presidentโs theory of โcauseโ has no limiting principle.  It would allow him to remove \nany Federal Reserve Board member with whom he disagrees about policy by accusing themโor \nhaving one of his allies within the administration accuse themโof anything he invents.  If this \nunderstanding of โcauseโ were correct, the statutory guarantee that has safeguard the Federal \nReserveโs independence for the past century would be reduced to an empty formality.  โ[I]f Mr. \nTrump prevails, he will essentially control the FOMC because he will then be able to fire other \nboard members at will, and the board can fire Fed regional bank presidents on the committee.โ \nEditorial,  What  if  Trump  Runs  the  Federal  Reserve?,  Wall  St.  J.  (Aug.  26,  2025),  \nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-fhfa-decd3fe6.  \nThe  President  has  no  statutory  authority  to  remove  Governor  Cook  over  a  policy \ndisagreement, which is the real reason he seeks her departure.  โStrictly as a matter of statutory \ninterpretation, if the [INM] standard means anything, it means that the President cannot discharge \na member of an independent agency simply because he disagrees with the agencyโs conclusions \nabout policy or fact.โ  Cass Sunstein & Adrian Vermuele, Presidential Review: The Presidentโs \nStatutory Authority over Independent Agencies, 109 Geo. L.J. 637, 648 (2021).  President Trump \nhas not been shy in commanding Governor Cook and other members of the Federal Reserve Board \nto lower interest rates or face consequences.  Since April 2025, the President has repeatedly issued \npublic statements demanding that Chairman Powell resign over his unwillingness to lower interest \nrates. And when that public pressure campaign went nowhere, the Presidentโwith the help of \nDirector  Pulteโdevised  a  plot  to  fire  Chairman  Powell,  potentially  through  the  pretextual \njustification of โfraud.โ  In July 2025, Director Pulte reportedly gave President Trump a draft of a \nletter  firing  Chairman  Powell,  which  President  Trump  showed  off  during  a  meeting  with \n \nthe Statutory Limits of Agency Independence, 121 Colum. L. Rev. at 6 (emphasis added).  Neither \nthe Presidentโs pretextual justification nor his real one fall within any of these categories. \n12 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 17 of 28\nlawmakers.21  Around the same time, on July 16, 2025, Director Pulte posted on X that renovations \nto the building that houses the Federal Reserve are โriddledโ with fraud, and President Trump \nstated that Chairman Powell could potentially be fired for that โfraud,โ noting that โI mean itโs \npossible thereโs fraud involved with the $2.5 billion renovationโ of the Federal Reserve building.22  \nThe Presidentโs attempt to remove Governor Cook, who throughout 2025 has consistently \nvoted with Chairman Powell in declining to lower interest rates, marks the implementation of the \nsame pretextual plot with a minor twist.  This time, instead of accusing Chairman Powell of โfraudโ \nin his role as Federal Reserve Chairman, Director Pulte and the President have decided to accuse \nGovernor cook of โpotentialโ fraud in her role as a private citizen.  But those unsubstantiated \nallegations cannot camouflage the Presidentโs real reason for attempting to remove Governor \nCook: he disagrees with her policy decisions.  This does not constitute โcauseโ within the meaning \nof the FRA.  \nSetting aside the fact that the Presidentโs purported โcauseโ for firing Governor Cook is \ninvalid because it is nakedly pretextual, the Presidentโs proffered justification for firing Governor \nCook would not constitute โcauseโ within the meaning of the FRA even if it were his true motive. \nThis Court need not define the precise contours of legitimate โcause,โ but it is enough to say that \nbare allegations of โpotentialโ mortgage fraudโin oneโs capacity as a private citizen years before \ntaking office, nonethelessโfall woefully short.  \nHere,  however,  the  President  has  pointed  to  nothing  more  than  an  unsubstantiated \nallegation in a general referral letter sent by Director Pulte โ no investigation, no evidence, not \neven a formal charge to support his allegations.  Remarkably, the President and Director Pulte have \n \n21 Maggie Haberman & Colby Smith, Trump Has Draft of Letter to Fire Fed Chair. He Asked \nRepublicans  if  He  Should  Send  It.,  N.Y.  Times  (July  16,  2025), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/politics/trump-powell-firing-letter.html. \n22 Id.  \n13 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 18 of 28\nnot even asserted unambiguously that Governor Cook actually committed a crime.  Director \nPulteโs  referral  to  the  Department  of  Justice  states  only  that  Governor  Cook  โpotentiallyโ \ncommitted mortgage fraud.  \nThis cannot suffice.  To begin with, the โpotential[ity]โ that Governor Cook mislabeled a \nhomeโs purpose on a mortgage application well before her Board appointment without any \nallegation of its intentionality or materiality would not be the type of โoffenseโ that would \nconstitute โcause.โ  Then, allowing such a charge to be the basis for Presidential action with no \ninvestigation, substantiation, formal charge or court finding could hardly be enough evidence on \nwhich a โcauseโ firing could occur.  And, as explained below, due process protections entitle an \nofficeholder to notice and a hearing to contest whatever evidence was presented.  \nConsequently, neither the type of โoffenseโ the President cited nor the threadbare evidence \nagainst Governor Cook would constitute โcauseโ for removal even if the Presidentโs allegations \nwere trueโwhich they are not.  After evaluating the evidence, whether an offense amounts to \nโcauseโ for removal should depend on a combination of when it occurred, whether it occurred in \nthe performance of the officeholderโs official duties, and how serious of an offense it is.  The \nPresident would not have โcauseโ to remove a Federal Reserve Governor even if he possessed \nsmoking gun evidence that she jaywalked in college.  And here, he would not have โcauseโ to \nremove Governor Cook even if she had erred in filling out a form for a private mortgage before \nshe assumed office.  None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor \nCookโs duties as a Federal Board member.  And the President and Director Pulte have not even \nalleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was \nintentional. Even if Governor Cook had committed the infractions that the President allegesโ\nwhich she did notโthe President would lack โcauseโ to remove her under 12 U.S.C. ยง 242.  \n14 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 19 of 28\nIf the โdistinct historical traditionโ23 of the Federal Reserve means anything, it is that the \nPresident cannot rely on brute force or clever shortcuts to circumvent Congress to bend the \ninstitution to his will.  History provides no sanction for an attempt to short-circuit โfor causeโ \nremoval protections by conjuring up unfounded allegations of past wrongdoing.  \nThat the President says he has found a โcauseโ does not magically make it so.  If the \nPresident and his allies can create โcauseโ by leveling pretextual and unfounded allegations of \nwrongdoing, then the protections of 12 U.S.C. ยง 242 are entirely meaningless. Under bedrock \nprinciples of statutory construction, this Court cannot adopt an interpretation of โfor causeโ that \nwould โin practical effect render [statutory language] entirely superfluous in all but the most \nunusual circumstances.โ  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 29 (2001).  Under the Presidentโs \nlimitless conception of โcause,โ the removal protections that Congress afforded to Federal Reserve \nBoard members would be reduced to a nullity.  And upon their erasure, the Federal Reserveโs near-\ncentury of independence would be relegated to the ash heap of history.  \nB.  Defendants  Violated  Governor  Cookโs  Fifth  Amendment  Due  Process \nRights and Statutory Right to Notice and a Hearing.  \nPresident Trump deprived Governor Cook of her procedural rights under both the Fifth \nAmendment and the Federal Reserve Act by purportedly โfiringโ her without notice or a hearing. \nThe Fifth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause guarantees that no person shall be โdeprived of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of law.โ U.S. Const. amend. V.  Here, President Trump \nhas attempted to deprive Governor Cook of her property interest in her position as a Governor on \nthe Federal Reserve Board without providing any process whatsoever.  \nThere is no doubt that Governor Cook has a property right in her continued employment \nas a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board.  The Federal Reserve Act establishes that right by \n \n23 Trump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (May 22, 2025).  \n15 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 20 of 28\nproviding that Board members may not be fired without โcause.โ  12 U.S.C. ยง 242.  The Supreme \nCourt has expressly stated that where a statute provides a public employee with for cause removal \nprotection, the employee possesses a property interest in her continued employment.  Cleveland \nBd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985).  The D.C. Circuit recently reiterated the \nongoing viability of this precise property interest.  See Esparraguera v. Depโt of the Army, 101 \nF.4th 28, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (โ[A] property interest exists if the employee can โbe removed only \nfor cause.โโ) (quoting Thompson v. District of Columbia, 530 F.3d 914, 918 (D.C. Cir. 2008)).  \nBecause Governor Cook possesses a property interest in her position on the Board, the Due \nProcess Clause guarantees that she cannot be removed withoutโat a minimumโโoral or written \nnotice of the charges against [her], an explanation of the employerโs evidence, and an opportunity \nto present [her] side of the story.โ  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546.  And critically, both the Supreme \nCourt and D.C. Circuit have instructed that any such hearing must take place โprior to the \ndischarge of an employee.โ  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542 (emphasis added); Esparraguera, 101 \nF.4th at 40 (โOur cases are clear that, absent exigent circumstances not implicated here, the Due \nProcess Clause requires, at minimum, that the government provide notice and some kind of hearing \nbefore final deprivation of a property interest.โ) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted) \n(emphasis in original). \nGovernor Cook received neither notice nor a hearing before her purported โfiring.โ Instead, \nshe found out about the attempt to remove her through President Trumpโs Truth Social post, which \ncontained a letter addressed to Governor Cook stating that โyou are hereby removed from your \nposition on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, effective immediatelyโ24 (emphasis \nadded).  Regardless of the factual basis underpinning the attempt to remove an employee with for \n \n24  Donald  J.  Trump  (@realDonaldTrump),  Truth  Social  (Aug.  25,  2025,  8:02  PM), \nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115092130707196133.  \n16 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 21 of 28\ncause protection (and here, there is nothing more than an unsubstantiated allegation that Governor \nCook filled out a form incorrectly), the Supreme Court has explained that \nSome opportunity for the employee to present [her] side of the case is recurringly \nof obvious value in reaching an accurate decision. . . . Even where the facts are \nclear, the appropriateness or necessity of the discharge may not be; in such cases, \nthe only meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker is \nlikely to be before the termination takes effect. \n \nLoudermill, 470 U.S. at 543 (internal citations omitted).  Governor Cook was never afforded notice \nor the opportunity to present her side of the case.  She was therefore deprived of her constitutional \nright to due process under the Fifth Amendment.  \n  Governor Cookโs purported termination without notice and a hearing also violated her \nstatutory rights to these same protections under the FRA.  The Supreme Court has recognized that \nโfor causeโ removal protections also create a statutory right to notice and a hearing.  See Reagan \nv. United States, 182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901) (โ[W]here the term of office is for a fixed period, notice \nand hearing are essential.โ); Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 314 (1903) (โIt must be \npresumed that the President did not make the removal for any cause assigned in the statute, because \nthere was given to the officer no notice or opportunity to defend.โ).  The Presidentโs attempt to \nremove Governor Cook violates the procedural protections of the FRA, as the statuteโs inclusion \nof โfor causeโ removal protectionโa term of artโconferred in Governor Cook a statutory right to \nnotice and a hearing.  The President attempted to terminate her without even the pretense of either.   \nII.  Governor Cook Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent Relief. \nEmergency relief is necessary because, without it, Governor Cook is at the threshold of \nsuffering  irreparable  injury  from  Defendantsโ  conductโdepriving  her  of  her  Presidentially-\nappointed and Senate-confirmed role as a Federal Reserve Board Governor.  See Berry v. Reagan, \n1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  \nFurther highlighting the irreparable nature of Governor Cookโs harm, during a Cabinet meeting on \n17 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 22 of 28\nAugust 26, 2025, President Trump said he has already named a group of candidates to replace \nher.25  Without emergency relief, Defendants are now likely to allow an unexpired vacancy to \noccur for which President Trump has indicated he is ready to fill.   \nPresident Trumpโs unlawful attempt to remove Governor Cook will also cause irreparable \nharm to her efforts as Governor to preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve Board.  See \nAlbrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of Fed. Reserve Emp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 67 (D.C. \nCir. 2004) (โAn integral part of the federal government, the Board conducts monetary policy, \nregulates  banking  institutions,  and maintains the stability of  the  nation's  financial system.โ).   \nPresident Trump is already touting that the Federal Reserve Board โwill have a majority very \nshortlyโ of members he has selected.26   President Trumpโs statements and actions are undermining \nthe publicโs perception of the Federal Reserve as independent, directly threatening its mission of \nproviding stability.  As the Supreme Court recognized in Humphreyโs Executor, the โcoercive \ninfluence of [at-will removal power] threatens the independence of a commission.โ  295 U.S. at \n630.   Governor Cook was duty-sworn to maintain that independence.  \nTo demonstrate irreparable harm, a moving party must satisfy two requirements.  Radio \nFree Europe/Radio Liberty, Inc. v. Lake, 772 F. Supp. 3d 79, 85 (D.D.C. 2025). โFirst, the harm \nmust be certain and great, actual and not theoretical, and so imminen[t] that there is a clear and \npresent need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.โ  Id. (citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  โSecond, the harm must be beyond remediation.โ  Id. (citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  Here, as in Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Inc., the harm movant currently faces is \nโgreat, actual and not theoreticalโ and is exceedingly imminent.

Irreparable harm in cases of \nremoval of individuals appointed to independent boards is based on โthe[ir] โunlawful removal \nfrom office by the Presidentโ and โthe obviously disruptive effectโ that such removal has on the \norganizationโs functioning.โ  Wilcox v.

Here, President Trumpโs unlawful attempt to \nremove Governor Cook is causing her, and her ability to carry out her oath to protect the Federal \nReserve, and subsequently, our nationโs economy, irreparable harm.   \nIII.  The Balance of the Equities and Public Interest Favor Governor Cook.  \nThe proper and independent functioning of the Federal Reserve Board, and the economic \nstability that it provides, is plainly in the public interest.  The Federal Reserve board โserve[s] the \npublic interest by providing the nation with a stable financial situation and by setting and \nimplementing monetary policy.โ  TNB USA Inc. v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 2020 WL 1445806, \nat *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2020) (internal citation omitted).  The D.C. Circuit has recognized the \nimportance of the Federal Reserveโs independence: \n19 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 24 of 28\nThe  independence  of  financial  regulators  remains  a  prominent  pattern \ntoday. The Federal Reserve Board is led by governors who can be removed \nonly for cause during their fourteen-year terms. 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. The reason \nis simple: The Federal Reserve must โprovide for the sound, effective, and \nuninterrupted operation of the banking system,โ and Congress found that a \ndegree of independence was needed to โincrease the ability of the banking \nsystem  to  promote  stability.โ  H.R.  Rep.  No.  74-742,  at  1  (1935).  By \ninsulating the Board from presidential control and political pressures, \nCongress sought to ensure that the Federal Reserve would โreflect, not the \nopinion of a majority of special interests, but rather the well considered \njudgment of a body that takes into consideration all phases of national \neconomic life. \nPHH Corp. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 881 F.3d 75, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (internal citation \nomitted) (emphasis added).  Here, President Trumpโs actions amount to the exact โpresidential \ncontrol and political pressuresโ from which Congress intended to insulate the Board.  Id.  The \npublic interest favors maintaining the very stability that the Federal Reserve was created to \npreserve, at least until the novel issues presented by Governor Cookโs attempted โfiringโ can be \nproperly adjudicated.  \n  The marketโs immediate reaction to President Trumpโs attempt to fire Governor Cook only \nunderscores the strength of the publicโs interest in the Federal Reserve Boardโs independence. \nShortly after President Trump announced his purported firing of Governor Cook, the dollar \nweakened against major currencies.27  Long-dated U.S. Treasuries also fell.28  As four former \nchairs of the Federal Reserve Board explained in a joint article in 2019: \n[R]esearch has shown that monetary policy based on the political (rather than \neconomic) needs of the moment leads to worse economic performance in the long \nrun,  including  higher  inflation  and  slower  growth.

Ct. at 1420 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  Through the Federal Reserve Act, \nCongress expressed its clear will that Federal Reserve Board members be free from political \ninterference.  That is the interest that President Trumpโs attempted firing has imperiled. \n   The countervailing interest at stake, which President Trump seems to openly admit, is his \ndesire to control the countryโs central bank.  But that has never been within the scope of the \nPresidentโs power.  โ[T]he Fedโs most important responsibility is administration of the money \nsupply,โ (and resultingly, interest rates) and โunlike law enforcement, administration of the money \nsupply is not an executive function โ so the Fedโs independence does not offend the traditional \n \n29 Additionally, several editorials published in U.S. newspapers since President Trumpโs August \n25 letter was released clearly support and demonstrate that relief for Governor Cook is in the public \ninterest.

CPSC, 98 F.4th \n646, 656 (5th Cir. 2024) (Oldham, J., joined by seven other judges, dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc).   As DOJ recently conceded in trying to defend the Presidentโs firings of board \nmembers of a different agency:  \nThe early Congresses further provided that the Banks of the United Statesโlike the \nFederal Reserveโwould have a degree of insulation from the Presidentโs control.  \nCongress provided that all of the First Bankโs directors and 80% of the Second \nBankโs directors would not be subject to presidential removal at all, while the \nFederal Reserve Governors may be removed by the President only โfor cause.โ  The \nBanks of the United States and their successor in the Federal Reserve represent a \nunique institution with a unique history and background.  Its historical pedigree \ncannot be generally extrapolated to other federal entities.  \n \nHarris v. Bessent, No. 25-5037, Reply Br. for Appellants at 15 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 11, 2025) (internal \ncitations omitted).  The Government should have to live by its words argued to the Court from just \nfour months ago. \nThe President has no legitimate interest in manipulating the composition of the Federal \nReserve Board so that he can dictate interest rates.

Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. at 1415. \nThe President seeks to upend that tradition.  Governor Cook asks only that the Court preserve the \nstatus quo, as such relief would vindicate important equities and public interests, while imposing \na de minimis burden on the President, who seeks to exercise power outside of his Article II and \nstatutory authority, and will soon enough have an opportunity to present his case and seek to defend \nhis unprecedented conduct.  \n22 \n \n\n  Case 1:25-cv-02903-JMC     Document 2-1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 27 of 28\nCONCLUSION \nIn light of President Trumpโs first-of-its kind attack on the independence of the Federal \nReserve Board, and the clear and imminent harm facing Governor Cook should her removal be \neffectuated, Governor Cook moves for an immediate temporary restraining order (1) declaring that \nPresident Trumpโs August 25, 2025 attempted firing of Governor Cook is unlawful under the \nFederal Reserve Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and that Governor Cook \nis still a member of the Federal Reserve Board; and (2) enjoining Defendants the Federal Reserve \nBoard  of  Governors,  collectively  and/or  individually,  and  Chairman  Jerome  Powell  from \neffectuating in any manner Governor Cookโs purported removal from her position or in any way \ntreating her as having been removed, or denying or obstructing her in accessing any of the benefits \nor resources of her Board position.  \n \n \n \nDated: August 28, 2025      Respectfully Submitted, \n/s/ Abbe David Lowell \nAbbe David Lowell [Bar No. 358651] \nBrenna L.

Cook.  This \nfollowed his August 20, 2025 call for her to resign based on nothing more than another social \nmedia posting, this one by Federal Housing Finance Agency (โFHFAโ) Director William Pulte, \nwho has been using his office to allege mortgage wrongdoing against other public officials, now \nturning his sights to Governor Cook.  The operational independence of the Federal Reserve is vital \nto its ability to make sound economic decisions, free from the political pressures of an election \ncycle. \nThis case challenges President Trumpโs unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove \nGovernor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would the first of its kind in the \nBoardโs history.  It would subvert the Federal Reserve Act (โFRAโ), which explicitly requires a \nshowing of โcauseโ for a Governorโs removal, which an unsubstantiated allegation about private \nmortgage applications submitted by Governor Cook prior to her Senate confirmation is not.  \nThe Presidentโs actions violate Governor Cookโs Fifth Amendment due process rights and \nher statutory right to notice and a hearing under the FRA.  Accordingly, Governor Cook seeks \nimmediate declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm her status as a member of the Board of \nGovernors, safeguard her and the Boardโs congressionally mandated independence, and allow \nGovernor Cook and the Federal Reserve to continue its critical work. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 3 of 24\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยง 1331 because Plaintiffโs causes of action arise under the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates. \n2.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Lisa D. Cook is a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve.  She was confirmed by the United States Senate to a full 14-year term on the Federal \nReserve Board of Governors on September 6, 2023.  Governor Cookโs term on the Board ends on \nJanuary 31, 2038.  Governor Cook brings this suit in her official capacity as a member of the Board \nof Governors and her personal capacity.  \n4.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States and is responsible \nfor the attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n5.  Defendant  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System  (โBoard  of \nGovernorsโ  or  the  โBoardโ)  is  the  governing  body  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System  and  is \nheadquartered in Washington, DC.  The Board is an agency of the United States comprised of \nseven members, or โgovernors,โ serving staggered 14-year terms who are nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate.  The Board is sued collectively, and its Governors are sued \nindividually in their official capacities, to the extent that any individual Governor has the ability \nto take any action to effectuate President Trumpโs purported termination of Governor Cook.   \n6.  Defendant Jerome H. Powell is the Chair of the Board of Governors, which is \nheadquartered in Washington, DC.  Defendant Powell is sued in his official capacity as Chair of \nthe Board, to the extent that he has any ability to take any action to effectuate President Trumpโs \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 4 of 24\n \npurported termination of Governor Cook. \nSTATUTORY AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND ON THE  \nINDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE \n7.  Since its establishment in 1913, Congress intended for the Federal Reserve System \nto function independent of political interference.  As articulated by the Supreme Court in Wilcox \nv. Trump, โ[t]he Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the \ndistinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.โ  145 S. Ct. 1415, \n1415 (May 22, 2025) (citing Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. \n197, 222 n.8 (2020)).  The intent that the Federal Reserve retain independence has been reinforced \nby statutory amendments to the FRA in 1935, 1977, and 2010. \n8.  The Board of Governors is the seven-member governing body of the Federal \nReserve  Systemโmade  up  of  the  chairperson  plus  six  governorsโresponsible  for  setting \nmonetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, and maintaining financial stability.  The \ngovernors, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, serve staggered 14-\nyear terms.  The long and staggered term procedure reinforces the independence of the Board. \n9.  An independent Federal Reserve is essential for a stable economy, as the short-term \npolitical interests of a president often clash with sound monetary policy.  Presidents, facing \npressure to boost the economy, may favor lower interest rates and a more expansive policy to \nachieve a temporary economic lift.  However, this approach often fuels long-term inflation.  A \npolitically insulated Board of Governors can make appropriate, albeit unpopular, decisionsโ such \nas raising interest rates to combat inflationโthat are crucial for the nationโs long-term financial \nhealth.  \n10.  The Federal Reserveโs effectiveness in managing inflation and economic stability \ndepends on its credibility.  If markets and the public believe that the central bank is making \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 5 of 24\n \ndecisions based on political pressure rather than sound economic data, that confidence erodes.  A \nlack of credibility can make a central bankโs job much harder; for example, if markets anticipate \nhigher inflation in the long run due to a political decision to temporarily boost the economy, it can \nbecome a self-fulfilling prophecy.  An independent central bank, by contrast, acts predictably and \ntransparently, which stabilizes markets and the wider economy.  In the few days following \nPresident Trumpโs unprecedented action, media, economists, and academics from across the \npolitical spectrum have sounded the alarm that his actions threaten the historic independence of \nthe Federal Reserve. \n11.  An independent Federal Reserve also prevents presidential administrations from \nusing  monetary  policy  for  self-serving  political  ends  in  other  ways,  such  as  ensuring  the \ngovernment cannot simply print more money to finance debt.  This practice, when unchecked, can \nlead to economic collapse and hyperinflation.  \n12.  The  independence  of  the  Federal  Reserve  is  supported  by  several  statutory \nprovisions  that  shield  the  Board  of  Governors  from  political  interference.    Such  statutory \nprovisions include the Boardโs funding outside the annual appropriations process;2 the Boardโs \nauthority to set all terms and conditions of Board employment;3 the Boardโs exemption from \nGovernment Accountability Office audits of its monetary policy decisions;4 the Boardโs authority \nto  litigate  independently;5  the  Boardโs  ability  to  present  legislative  recommendations  and \ntestimony to Congress without executive branch approval;6 the exemption of the Boardโs monetary \n \n2 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. ยงยง 243, 244. \n3 12 U.S.C. ยง 244. \n4 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. ยง 3910(a)(3) (exempting from GAO audits of the Board and Reserve Banks, \ninter alia, discussions or communications relating to monetary policy matters, transactions under \nthe direction of the FOMC, or transactions with foreign central banks); 31 U.S.C. ยง 714(b) (same).  \n5  See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. ยง 248(p). \n6 12 U.S.C. ยง 250 (prohibiting any โofficer or agency of the United Statesโ from requiring the \nBoard โto submit legislative recommendations, or testimony, or comments on legislation, to any \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 6 of 24\n \npolicy decisions from the Congressional Review Act;7 and the Boardโs authorization to participate \ndirectly in certain international fora without executive branch intermediation.8  \n13.  One of the statutory devices used to maintain this crucial independence of the \nFederal Reserve is a โfor causeโ removal protection for Board Governors.  The FRA expressly \nprovides that \nUpon the expiration of the term of any appointive member of the Federal Reserve Board \nin office on August 23, 1935, the President shall fix the term of the successor to such \nmember at not to exceed fourteen years, as designated by the President at the time of \nnomination, but in such manner as to provide for the expiration of the term of not more \nthan one member in any two-year period, and thereafter each member shall hold office for \na term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner \nremoved for cause by the President. \n \n12 U.S.C. ยง 242 (emphasis added).  \n \n14.  The โfor causeโ removal protection guaranteed by the FRA, which has been the \nbulwark of the Federal Reserveโs independence for the past century, prevents the President from \nfiring a Federal Reserve Board governor except โfor cause,โ meaning instances of inefficiency, \nneglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct.  \n15.  In Humphreyโs Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and Wiener v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality \nof such statutory protections for government officials serving on multi-member agencies.  In \nHumphreyโs Executor, the Court found that Congress has the authority to restrict presidential \nremovals โdepend[ing] upon the character of the office.โ 295 U.S  at 631.  Specifically, โfor-causeโ \nremoval restrictions were deemed constitutional with respect to officers at the FTC; in reaching \n \nofficer  or  agency  of  the  United  States  for  approval,  comments,  or  review,  prior  to [their] \nsubmissionโ) \n7 5 U.S.C. ยง 807 (exempting โrules that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the \nBoardโ and FOMC from the Congressional Review Act).   \n8 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. ยง 3907(b)(3)(C), 12 U.S.C. ยง 3911, 12 U.S.C. ยง 5373(c), 22 USC ยง 9522(b) \nnote.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 7 of 24\n \nthis conclusion, the Court specifically relied on the FTCโs structure as (a) โa body of experts,โ (b) \nwith long, staggered terms, (c) that was designed to be โnonpartisanโ and act โwith entire \nimpartiality.โ   Id. at 624โ25.  \n16.  The  Supreme  Court  recently  made  clear  that  the  analysis  in  Humphreyโs \nExecutor applies with particular force to the Federal Reserve.  In a case about the Presidentโs \nremoval of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems \nProtection Board, the Court permitted the removals to take effect, but specifically distinguished \nthe removal protections for Federal Reserve Governors. The Court addressed the quasi-private \nnature of the Federal Reserve and the historical importance of its for-cause removal protections as \nunique even among independent agencies:  \n[R]espondents Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris contend that arguments in this case \nnecessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of \nthe Federal Reserveโs Board of Governors or other members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee. [] We disagree. The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private \nentity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the \nUnited States. \n \nTrump v. Wilcox, 145 S. Ct. 1415, 1415 (May 22, 2025) (internal citations omitted; emphases \nadded). \n17.  The Government similarly has stated in court that โthe Federal Reserve represent a \nunique institution with a unique history and background,โ and thus is distinguishable from โother \nfederal entities.โ  Harris v. Bessent, No. 25-5037, Reply Br. for Appellants at 15 (D.C. Cir. Apr. \n11, 2025) (internal citations omitted).   \n18.  This is not the first time the Supreme Court has distinguished the Federal Reserve \nfrom other government agencies.  The recent analysis in Trump v. Wilcox builds on what the Court \npreviously signaled about the unique nature of the Federal Reserve and how it is differently \nsituated from other agencies in Seila Law.  591 U.S. at 222 n.8.     \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 8 of 24\n \n19.  As the Courtโs decision in Trump v. Wilcox makes clear, the Federal Reserve \nuniquely relies on its independence to function in the historical tradition of an independent central \nbank.  The โfor causeโ statutory removal provision provided by the FRA is essential to protecting \nthis independence. \n20.  The โfor causeโ standard is not defined in the FRA, but statutes establishing the \nstandard for other independent agencies expressly limit cause to the standard that is articulated in \nHumphreyโs Executor: There must be a specific finding of โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office.โ 295 U.S. at 623.  Courts and litigants have assumed the standard in cases \nwhere such language is not expressed in the statute.  See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. \nOversight  Bd.,  561  U.S.  477,  487  (2010)  (decided  โwith  [the]  understandingโ  that  SEC \nCommissioners could only be removed under the Humphreyโs Executor standard of โinefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,โ even in the absence of explicit statutory for cause \nremoval protection, after both parties agreed to such an understanding). \n21.  The Supreme Court has not defined โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin officeโ (emphasis added), but historical use of these terms indicates that (a) โโneglect of dutyโ \nmeant failing to perform oneโs duties in a way that caused specific harm to the entity . . . to which \nthe duties were owedโ; (b) โmalfeasanceโ connoted the commission of an unlawful act in the \nperformance of oneโs official duties; and (c) the โinefficiencyโ standard targets concerns about \nโwaste, especially . . . result[ing] from self-interested dealing,โ and was designed to โensur[e] that \n. . . officers did their jobs competently and honestly.โ  Lev Menand and Jane Manners, The Three \nPermissions, 121 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 29, 48โ49 (2021) (tracing the historical meaning of the term \nthrough English common law and early American law).  \n22.  Congressional intent that the โfor causeโ standard in the FRA requires a finding of \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 9 of 24\n \nโinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in officeโ is illustrated by the fact that Congress \namended the FRA three months after the Supreme Courtโs decision in Humphreyโs Executor to \nprovide Board members with 14-year terms โunless sooner removed for cause by the President.โ \n49 Stat. 684, 704 (emphasis added).  Prior to that, the statute was silent on removal.  The \nHumphreyโs Executor decision was raised in the hearings on the passage of these amendments to \nthe FRA.  See Gary Richardson & David Wilcox, How Congress Designed the Federal Reserve to \nbe Independent of Presidential Control, 39 J. of Econ. Persp. 221, 229 (2025). \n23.  Whether or not the FRAโs โfor causeโ removal provision is interpreted using the \nusual standard of โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,โ it clearly does not \nsupport removal for policy disagreements.  See Humphreyโs Executor, 295 U.S. at 619 (finding \nthe Presidentโs decision to remove an FTC member because their minds did not โgo along together \non either the policies or the administeringโ of the agency failed to satisfy grounds for removal); \nWiener, 357 U.S. at 350 (President did not have cause to remove commissioner because he \nbelieved it was in the โnational interestโ to appoint โpersonnel of [his own selection); Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 229 (noting that Humphreyโs Executor โimplicitly rejected an interpretation that would \nleave the President free to remove an officer based on disagreements about agency policyโ).  \n24.  Allowing the President to remove members of the Board over policy disagreements \nwould also render illusory the Boardโs independence, as emphasized throughout the statutory \nprovisions protecting such independence in the FRA. \n25.  As the Courtโs articulation of the standard in Humphreyโs Executor makes clear, \nremoval โfor causeโ requires some connection to official conduct, prohibiting removal based on \nan unsubstantiated allegation of private misconduct (which in this case allegedly occurred prior to \nher Senate confirmation).  And even to the extent that private misconduct could bear on a particular \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 10 of 24\n \nofficerโs official conduct in certain cases, โcauseโ requires a factual basis supporting such asserted \nmisconduct. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \nGovernor Cookโs Background \n26.  Governor Cook is a distinguished economist with a background in academia, \npolicy, and research.

The  Director  of  the  Federal  Housing  Finance  Agency,  William  Pulte,  was \nconfirmed to his role in March 2025.  The FHFAโs stated mission is to โensure the regulated \nentities fulfill their mission by operating in a safe and sound manner to serve as a reliable source \nof liquidity and funding for the housing finance market throughout the economic cycle.โ15 \n40.  Since his confirmation, Director Pulte, often through social media postings, has \nused his office to allege mortgage wrongdoing against public officials, now turning his sights on \nGovernor Cook.  Each of Director Pulteโs criminal referrals have notably been, at one time or \nanother, political targets of President Trumpโs ire prior to any mortgage fraud allegations.   \n41.  Director  Pulte  has  also  parroted  President  Trumpโs  criticisms  of  the  Federal \nReserve.

President Trump did not send a copy of the letter to Governor Cook prior to posting \nit to social media.  He provided no advance notice, nor any opportunity for Governor Cook to \nrespond. \n48.  As justification for the alleged firing, President Trumpโs letter cites the Federal \nReserve Act, 12 U.S.C. ยง 242, which specifies that Federal Reserve Board members may only be \nโremoved for cause by the President.โ  The letter claims that the President has โdetermined that \nthere is sufficient cause to remove [Governor Cook] from [her] position.โ  \n49.  The  letterโs  only  reference  to  President  Trumpโs  โcauseโ  for  purportedly \nterminating Governor Cook was Director Pulteโs โcriminal referral,โ which President Trump cited \nfor his belief that Governor Cook โmay have made false statements on one or more mortgage \nagreements.โ (emphasis added). President Trump also attached the referral letter as Exhibit A to \nhis letter.  According to President Trump, the โmay haveโ is enough to conclude Governor Cook \ndid something improper, even though the allegation is wholly unrelated to her official duties and \ndoes not amount to Section 242 โcause.โ \n50.  The claims made in Director Pulteโs referral letter are unsubstantiated allegations \nthat about conduct that predates her Senate confirmation, and Governor Cook has never been given \nan opportunity to address them. \n51.  After President Trump announced Governor Cookโs purported termination by \nletter, Director Pulte stated on X, โFraud will not be tolerated in President Trumpโs housing \nmarket.โ23  Director Pulte also released a โU.S. Federal Housing Statement on the Firing of Lisa \nCookโ on X that stated: โThank you President Trump for your commitment to stopping mortgage \n \n23  Bill  Pulte  (@pulte),  X  (Aug.  25,  2025,  8:12  PM), \nhttps://x.com/pulte/status/1960133164006793700. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 16 of 24\n \nfraud and following the law. If you commit mortgage fraud in America, we will come after you, \nno matter who you are.โ24 \n52.  The following day, August 26, 2025, President Trump was sitting in a Cabinet \nmeeting when he told reporters, โIf you did your job properly, we wouldnโt have problems like \nLisa Cook,โ and added, โI think we have to have lower interest rates, yes.โ  When asked about the \nreferral allegations, President Trump stated, โshe seems to have had an infraction, and she canโt \nhave an infraction.  Especially that infraction because she's in charge of, if you think about it, \nmortgages, and we need people that are 100 percent above-board, and it doesnโt seem like she \nwas.โ25 \n53.  Even if the President had been more careful in obscuring his real justification for \ntargeting Governor Cook, the Presidentโs concocted basis for removalโthe unsubstantiated and \nunproven allegation that Governor Cook โpotentiallyโ erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to \nher Senate confirmationโdoes not amount to โcauseโ within the meaning of the FRA and is \nunsupported by caselaw.  \n54.  The prevailing understanding of โfor causeโ removal protection has long been \nanchored to โthe Humphreyโs Executor standard of โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office.โโ  Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 487 (quoting Humphreyโs Executor, 295 U.S. at \n620 (1935). \n55.  The unsubstantiated mortgage fraud allegations that allegedly occurred prior to \nGovernor  Cookโs  Senate  confirmation  do  not  amount  to  โinefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office,โ nor has the President alleged that they do.   \n \n24 Bill Pulte (@pulte), X (Aug. 25, 8:17 PM), https://x.com/pulte/status/1960134373799272788. \n25 CBS Detroit, Trump promises crackdown on crime, removes Federal Reserve board member \nLisa Cook, YouTube (Aug. 26, 2025), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKraD8JVEBU. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 17 of 24\n \n56.  Even  if  the  Presidentโs  authority  to  remove  a  Board  member  โfor  causeโ \nencompassed circumstances beyond โinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,โ \nPresident Trump does not have the power to unilaterally redefine โcauseโโcompletely unmoored \nto caselaw, history, and traditionโand conclude, without evidence, that he has found it.  Certainly, \na policy dispute between the President and a Governor does not constitute โcause.โ  Neither does \na  specious  assertion  that  a  one  โpotentiallyโ  committed  a  crimeโone  which  is  unproven, \nuncharged, and unrelated to official conduct.  \n57.  Indeed, President Trumpโs conception of โcauseโ has no limiting principle; it would \nallow him to remove any Federal Reserve Board member with whom he disagrees about policy \nbased on chalked up allegations.  That the President says he has found (or created) some basis for \nremoving a Governor does not magically make such a basis grounds for a โfor causeโ removal \nunder the FRA.  The President had no โcauseโ to remove Governor Cook under 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. \n58.  In an official statement on August 26, 2025, a Federal Reserve spokesperson did \nnot indicate that the Federal Reserve would ignore the Presidentโs illegal purported removal of \nGovernor Cook, instead stating that โCook has indicated through her personal attorney that she \nwill promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her \nability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System. . . . The Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to \ntransparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, \nand businesses,โ26 and added that the Federal Reserve Board โwill abide by any court decision.โ  \nThis Complaint seeks that decision. \n \n26 Dan Mangan, Fed responds to Trump effort to fire Lisa Cook, notes president needs โcause,โ \nCNBC (Aug. 26, 2025), https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/26/trump-fed-cook-respond-court.html. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 18 of 24\n \n59.  If President Trumpโs unlawful attempt to remove Governor Cook from the Board \nis allowed to take effect, President Trump would be able to nominate his own pick to fill that Board \nseat, with a term ending in 2038. \n60.  It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cookโs purported removal \nfrom the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order \nto effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his \nagenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve. \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT ONE \n \nVIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT  \n12 U.S.C. ยง 242 \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n61.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n62.  Under the FRAโs plain language, Governor Cook has a clear legal entitlement to \nretain her position as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.  Section 242 \nmandates that Federal Reserve Board members can be removed by the President prior to the \nexpiration of their term only โfor cause.โ  12 U.S.C. ยง 242. \n63.  President Trumpโs letter purporting to fire Governor Cook did not cite appropriate \ncause for removing her from the Board of Governors.  \n64.  President Trump did not purport to remove Governor Cook for โinefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,โ or for any actions that were carried out in the course of \nher official duties.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 19 of 24\n \n65.  Instead, the letter purporting to fire Governor Cook refers only to the fact that she \nโmay have made false statements on one or more mortgage agreementsโ in her personal capacity \nfour years ago, before she was a Governor.  This allegation about conduct that predates Governor \nCookโs Senate confirmation has never been investigated, much less proven.  This allegation is not \ngrounds for removal under the FRA.  \n66.  As a result, the Presidentโs purported termination of Governor Cook is ultra vires \nand a clear violation of law, and any attempts by the Non-Presidential Defendants to effectuate the \nillegal termination would be unlawful.  \nCOUNT TWO \n \nVIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT  \n(Statutory Right to Notice and a Hearing) \n12 U.S.C. ยง 242 \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n67.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here.  \n68.  President Trumpโs purported firing of Governor Cook deprived her of her statutory \nright to notice and a hearing under the FRA.  \n69.  The Supreme Court has recognized that โfor causeโ removal protections create a \nstatutory right to notice and a hearing.  See Reagan v. United States, 182 U.S. 419, 425 (1901) \n(โ[W]here the term of office is for a fixed period, notice and hearing are essential.โ); Shurtleff v. \nUnited States, 189 U.S. 311, 314 (1903) (โIt must be presumed that the President did not make the \nremoval for any cause assigned in the statute, because there was given to the officer no notice or \nopportunity to defend.โ).   \n70.  The Presidentโs attempt to remove Governor Cook violates Section 10 of the \nFederal Reserve Act, as the statuteโs inclusion of โfor causeโ removal protectionโa term of artโ\n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 20 of 24\n \nconferred on Governor Cook a statutory right to notice and a hearing. See 12 U.S.C. ยง 242. She \nwas given neither.  \n71.  As a result, the Presidentโs attempt to terminate Governor Cook was a clear \nviolation of Governor Cookโs statutory right to notice and hearing under the FRA, and any actions \nby the Non-Presidential Defendants to effectuate President Trumpโs attempt to terminate Governor \nCook would violate her statutory rights.   \nCOUNT THREE \n \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT \n(Procedural Due Process) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n72.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n73.  President Trump deprived Governor Cook of her rights under the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment.  \n74.  The Due Process Clause guarantees that no person shall be โdeprived of life, liberty, \nor property, without due process of law.โ U.S. Const. amend. V.  Here, President Trump has \nattempted to deprive Governor Cook of her property interest in her position as a Governor on the \nFederal Reserve Board without providing any process whatsoever.  \n75.  The Supreme Court has expressly stated that where a statute provides a public \nemployee with for-cause removal protection, that employee possesses a property interest in her \ncontinued employment.  Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985).  The \nD.C. Circuit recently reiterated the ongoing viability of this precise property interest.  See \nEsparraguera v. Depโt of the Army, 101 F.4th 28, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (โ[A] property interest exists \nif the employee can โbe removed only for cause.โโ) \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 21 of 24\n \n76.  Because the Federal Reserve Act establishes that Board members may not be fired \nwithout โcause,โ controlling Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent establish that Governor \nCook has a property interest in her continued employment as a Governor.  As a result, the Due \nProcess Clause provides that she cannot be removed withoutโat a minimumโโoral or written \nnotice of the charges against [her], an explanation of the employerโs evidence, and an opportunity \nto present [her] side of the story.โ  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546. \n77.  Governor Cook received neither notice nor a hearing before her purported firing.   \nInstead, she found out about the attempt to remove her through President Trumpโs Truth Social \npost containing a letter addressed to her stating that โyou are hereby removed from your position \non the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, effective immediately.โ  \n78.  As a result, the Presidentโs attempt to terminate Governor Cook was a clear \nviolation of the Due Process Clause, and any actions by the Non-Presidential Defendants to \neffectuate President Trumpโs illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from office would violate \nher Fifth Amendment due process rights.  \nCOUNT FOUR \n \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201, 2202 \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n79.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n80.  Governor Cook is entitled to declaratory relief on the basis of all claims identified.  \n81.  There  is  a  substantial  ongoing  controversy  between  Governor  Cook  and  the \nDefendants, and a declaration of rights under the Declaratory Judgment Act is both necessary and \nappropriate to establish that the Defendants do not have authority to remove Plaintiff without \naffording her all rights and protections set forth by applicable statutes and regulations. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02903     Document 1     Filed 08/28/25     Page 22 of 24\n \nCOUNT FIVE \n \nWRIT OF MANDAMUS \n(Against Non-Presidential Defendants) \n \n82.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n83.  In the alternative, Governor Cook is entitled to a writ of mandamus commanding \nDefendants not to interfere with her statutorily protected tenure in office unless and until she is \nremoved for cause pursuant to lawful procedures.  Defendants have a legal duty not to terminate \nPlaintiff without affording her the protections prescribed by law and, absent this Court granting \nrelief, there is no other adequate means of redress. \nCOUNT SIX \n \nEQUITABLE RELIEF FOR STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS \n(Against Non-Presidential Defendants) \n84.  The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n85.  Under this Courtโs traditional equitable jurisdiction, Governor Cook is entitled to \nequitable relief to prevent and restrain ongoing violations of both statutory and constitutional law \nby the Non-Presidential Defendants.  Equitable actions have โlong been recognized as the proper \nmeansโ to prevent public officials from acting unconstitutionally.  See Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. \nat 491 n.2 (quoting Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001)).   \n86.  Because such actions seek simply to halt or prevent a violation of federal law rather \nthan the award of money damages, they do not ask the Court to imply a new cause of action.  To \nthe contrary, the ability to sue to enjoin unlawful and unconstitutional actions by non-presidential \nfederal actors is the creation of courts of equity and reflects a long history of judicial review of \nillegal executive action, tracing back to England.
