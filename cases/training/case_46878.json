The complaint alleges violations of the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Constitution through infringement on the fundamental right to parent, treating similarly-situated parents differently, failing to consider ability to pay when enforcing the fees, and failing to adjust or end the fee payments for children who age out of foster care or who are adopted and no longer under state care.</p>",

Between 2018 and 2022, the state of Georgia tore apart more than 700 \nfamilies, removing children for the sole reason of “inadequate housing.”  Essentially, \nthe state deemed more than 700 families too poor to parent their own children, \nmoving those children (against their parents’ desire) into foster care.  Paradoxically, \nthe state then charged those same impoverished parents for the cost of foster care, \ndespite knowing that these parents could not afford those fees, that the state would \nnever see the money, and that unaffordable debt only delays family-reunification.  \nThis issue is not restricted to those years; in Georgia, your children can be removed \nfrom your care because you are too poor to afford housing, and the state will turn \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 2 of 57\naround and bill you into deeper poverty. \n2.  The federal government recognizes that “[i]t is almost never the case \nthat securing an assignment of the rights to child-support is in the best interest of the \nchild.”    https://cwpm.acf.gov/citations/title-iv-e/title-iv-e-general-title-iv-e-\nrequirements/title-iv-e-general-title-iv-e-1, 8.4C. TITLE IV-E, General Title IV-E \nRequirements, Child support.  Georgia itself admits that “[r]educing the income of \nthe parent(s) could impede their ability to engage in reunification efforts, potentially \nextending a child’s time in foster care.”  https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws/09-12 \n3.  The Georgia Division of Family and Children Services operates an \nunconstitutional child-support program in which the biological parents of children \nin foster care are charged exorbitant amounts of money with no regard for the \nparents’ inability to pay.  Inability to pay these child-support charges results in \nmounting debt, threats of incarceration, delayed reunification, and the denial of the \nconstitutional right to parent one’s children. \n4.  In August of 2024, recognizing the ineffectiveness of this practice and \nin keeping with federal guidance, the Georgia Division of Family and Children \nServices amended its policy to not enforce child-support where “reduced income \nmay prevent or delay reunification.”  Georgia Division of Family and Children \nServices Child Welfare Policy Manual, Chapter 9, 9.1, August 2024.  Unfortunately, \nthis amended policy is only applicable to new child-support cases and does nothing \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 3 of 57\nto change enforcement against indigent parents buried under child-support debts that \nthey will never be able to repay. \n5.  The previous policy has ongoing impacts; parents under the old pre-\n2024 policy are still not protected from exponentially increasing debt, threats of \nincarceration simply because they are poor, or the delays in family-reunification that \nmay result. \n6.  Despite the stated mission of the Division of Family and Children \nServices  to  “empower,  strengthen,  and  support  families  on  their  path  to \nindependence,” its policies disempower parents, weaken families, destabilize efforts \nfor  reunification,  and  keep  families  reliant  on  state  resources  by  making  poor \nfamilies poorer. \n7.  Child-support charges that lack consideration of ability to pay violate \nthe Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. \nPARTIES \n8.  Annalinda Martinez is a 40-year-old woman residing in Kennesaw, \nGeorgia. \n9.  Ms. Martinez has parented eight children.   She currently has custody \nof two of them (ages 5 and 2), three are now adults, two have been adopted (with \nMs.  Martinez’s  parental  rights  terminated),  and  one  is  in  foster  care  pending \nadoption (with Ms. Martinez’s parental rights terminated). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 4 of 57\n10.  At its highest amount, Ms. Martinez’s  child-support debt exceeded \n$13,000.  The bulk of that debt was paid with the assistance of Together With \nFamilies, a local nonprofit, but Ms. Martinez still struggles to pay her child-support. \n11.  Ms. Martinez has previously received letters from the Division of Child \nSupport Services threatening her with incarceration if her child-support remains \nunpaid. \n12.  Defendant  Georgia  Division  of  Family  and  Children  Services \n(“DFCS”)  is  a  division  of  Defendant  Georgia  Department  of  Human  Services \n(“DHS”)  operating  in  all  cities  and  counties  in  Georgia.    Defendant  DFCS  is \nresponsible for “provid[ing] numerous support services and innovative programs to \nhelp families in need.” https://dfcs.georgia.gov/about-us; https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/ \ndfcs/cws/09-01/; https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws/09-12/. \n13.  Defendant DFCS makes recommendations to courts throughout the \nstate in child-custody cases, advising courts as to the amount Defendant DFCS \nbelieves a parent should pay.  Defendant DFCS may also make a child-support \nreferral absent a court order. See https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws/09-12/. \n14.  In cases with child-support obligations, Defendant DFCS also creates \nand applies policies controlling enforcement of child-support orders for children in \nfoster care.  Id.   \n15.  Defendant DFCS’s policymaking role with regard to enforcement of \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 5 of 57\nthe collection of child-support is separate and independent from courts.  Due to \nDefendant DFCS’s independent authority over the enforcement of child-support \ncollections, Defendant DFCS is positioned to ensure that enforcement is fair and \nlawful.  This authority also enables Defendant DFCS to enact enforcement that is \narbitrary or discriminatory.  \n16.  Defendant Georgia Division of Child Support Services (“DCSS”) is a \ndivision  of  Defendant  DHS  operating  in  all  cities  and  counties  in  Georgia.  \nDefendant  DCSS  is  responsible  for  enforcing  child-support  obligations  for \nbiological parents with children in foster care and for reporting progress on child-\nsupport payments to Defendant DFCS. In other words, Defendant DFCS’s policy \ncontrols whether, how, and to what extent Defendant DCSS enforces child-support, \ngarnishes wages, and threatens incarceration.  See https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/ \ncws/09-12/ \n17.  Defendant DFCS refers child-support cases to Defendant DCSS for \nenforcement. \n18.  Child-support  collected  through  Defendant  DCSS’s  enforcement  is \nthen transferred to Defendant DFCS and disbursed to foster families by Defendant \nDFCS. https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws/09-01 \n19.  Under  the  current  policy,  Defendant  DFCS  is  responsible  for \ndetermining when and how Defendant DCSS should enforce support orders. https:// \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 6 of 57\npamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws/09-09/ \n20.  Defendant  DFCS  has  the  authority  to  recommend  selective \nenforcement of child-support by Defendant DCSS.  Id.  \n21.  Defendant DCSS has the authority to review and adjust child-support \nby request of the parent subject to payments.  Defendant DCSS’s authority in this \nregard exists independent of courts. \n22.  Defendant DHS is a department of the executive branch of the State of \nGeorgia.  Defendant DHS “delivers a wide range of human services designed to \npromote self-sufficiency, safety and well-being for all Georgians.”  It oversees all \nactivities  and  policies  of  both  DFCS  and  DCSS.  https://dfcs.georgia.gov/; \nhttps://dhs.georgia.gov/organization/about. \n23.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this complaint, Defendants \nhave acted under the color of state law, pursuant to their authority and responsibility \nas agencies of the State of Georgia. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n24.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Due \nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343. \n25.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 7 of 57\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Plaintiff’s History with DFCS \n \n26.  In December 2017 and January 2018, Ms. Martinez was living in an \napartment with her then-boyfriend and her six eldest daughters, all of whom were \nunder the age of 18.  Her then-boyfriend’s income paid the rent for their home. Ex. \n1, Martinez Declaration, ¶¶3–6. \n27.  Ms. Martinez learned that one of her daughters was being sexually \nabused  by  her  then-boyfriend.    Upon  discovering  the  abuse,  Ms.  Martinez \nimmediately called 9-1-1, and her then-boyfriend was arrested at their apartment \nsoon thereafter.  Ms. Martinez ended the relationship and testified against him in \ncourt, and he was incarcerated.  Id. at ¶¶ 4–5. \n28.  Ms. Martinez attempted to keep her family afloat by working three \ndifferent jobs, but without her former boyfriend’s income, Ms. Martinez was unable \nto afford the rent on the apartment in which she and her daughters lived.  They were \nevicted in January 2018, approximately one month after she reported the sexual \nassault.  Id. at ¶¶ 6–7. \n29.  Ms. Martinez did not have any nearby family or friends on whom she \ncould rely; on the night they were evicted, Ms. Martinez and her six daughters had \nno other options and slept in her van.  Id. at ¶¶ 6, 8. \n30.  After that first night, Ms. Martinez went immediately to her local DFCS \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 8 of 57\noffice.  She imagined and hoped that Defendant DFCS would help her find shelter \nfor her family.  She explained her situation to the DFCS employee she met with and \nwas told that DFCS would be happy to help her.  The DFCS employee instructed \nMs. Martinez to remain in the waiting room while the DFCS staff made calls on her \nbehalf.  Id. at ¶9. \n31.  At the end of that day, a DFCS employee informed Ms. Martinez that \nher children would be sent to foster placements and that she would be responsible \nfor finding her own housing.  DFCS did not offer Ms. Martinez a place in a shelter \nwith  her  daughters,  a  spot  on  a  waitlist  for  subsidized  housing,  or  any  other \nopportunity to remain with her children.  Id. at ¶10. \n32.  The following day, Ms. Martinez spoke with several DFCS workers in \nan attempt to get her daughters back.  Ms. Martinez was told their decision was final \nand could not be reversed.  Id. at ¶11. \n33.  Ms. Martinez was given conflicting information from Defendant DFCS \nregarding the requirements to have her children returned.  One DFCS employee told \nher that, in order to regain custody of her children, Ms. Martinez would need to \nsecure housing that would allow each of her six children to have her own room.  \nAnother employee told her that her daughters could share rooms, but only two per \nroom.  Neither were options that Ms. Martinez could afford without assistance.  Id. \n34.  After removing her children, Defendant DFCS formally recommended \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 9 of 57\nthat she pay child-support, despite knowing that she was indigent. \n35.  Although it did not specify a monetary amount, the written order from \nthe  court  hearing  formalizing  her  daughters’  foster  placement  stated  that  Ms. \nMartinez was responsible for reimbursing “all or part of the costs and expenses \nincurred for the treatment, care, and support of the children including but not limited \nto reimbursement of foster care per diem payments made in order to secure housing \nfor the children.”  Ex. 2, 2018-01-25 Cobb County Juvenile Court Order, pp. 3–4. \n36.  Ms. Martinez was required to pay $100 per month for child-support \nuntil that was adjusted to her current amount in fall 2019.  Ex. 1, Martinez Decl., \n¶16. \n37.  In October 2019, Defendants DHS and DCSS submitted a child-support \nworksheet to the court, recommending that Ms. Martinez pay nearly half of the \nincome they attributed to her in child-support.  The worksheet included no deviations \nfrom the standard obligation, despite Ms. Martinez living below the federal poverty \nlimits and being homeless.  Ex. 3, 2019-10-21 Child Support Worksheet, p. 1. \n38.  Defendants’ recommendation for Ms. Martinez’s child-support states \nthat, despite being sporadically employed and homeless,  Defendants found “no \nspecial circumstances sufficient to warrant deviation from the child support table.”  \nEx. 4, 2019-10-28 Order for Paternity and Child Support. \n39.  Ms. Martinez was ordered to pay $472 every month in child-support.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 10 of 57\nThis amount has not changed since and remains due every month, even at the time \nof this filing.  Id., see also Ex. 1, ¶16. \n40.  Ms. Martinez already had $500 in arrears when Defendants DFCS and \nDCSS made this recommendation in October 2019.  Ex. 4, p. 4. \n41.  Despite  knowing  of  her  indigence,  Defendants  DFCS  and  DCSS \ncontinued to enforce collection of child-support from Ms. Martinez. \n42.  In May 2023, with mounting child-support debt, no hope of sufficient \nhousing, and a promise from DFCS employees that her daughters would all be \nadopted together, Ms. Martinez executed a voluntary surrender of her parental rights.  \nThis surrender terminated parental rights for all six of the daughters she had at the \ntime.  Ex. 1, ¶22. \n43.  Of the six daughters who were removed from her custody and to whom \nshe surrendered her rights, three have turned 18 and left the foster care system, two \nhave been adopted, and one has a pending adoption.  Id. at ¶33. \n44.  Ms.  Martinez’s  support  amounts  did  not  change  following  her \nvoluntary surrender of parental rights.  Despite termination of her legal parental \nrights, Defendants DFCS and DCSS still enforce collection of $472 per month.  Id. \nat ¶28. \n45.  Ms. Martinez’s support amounts also did not change as her daughters \naged out and left foster care or were adopted.  Despite three of her daughters being \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 11 of 57\nadults and two being adopted, Defendants DFCS and DCSS still enforce collection \nof $472 per month.  Id. at ¶34. \n46.  Ms. Martinez has since had two additional children, currently ages 5 \nand 2.  She has custody of both of her youngest children.  Id. at ¶2. \n47.  Defendant DCSS has sent letters to Ms. Martinez regarding her $13,157 \nchild-support debt that threaten her with incarceration.  Ex. 5, 2024-07-12 DCSS \nDelinquency Letter; Ex. 6, 2024-10-20 DCSS Collection Letter. \n48.  Ms. Martinez fears that child-support debt could jeopardize her family \nand custodial children.  Ex. 1, ¶32; Ex. 2; Ex. 5. \n49.  Ms.  Martinez  sought  assistance  from  a  Georgia-based  nonprofit, \nTogether With Families.  Ex. 1, ¶32. \n50.  Ms. Martinez was able to pay off $13,157 in arrears with the assistance \nof a crowdfunding campaign and Together With Families.  Id. \n51.  Ms.  Martinez  was  recently  made  aware  of  her  right  to  request  a \nmodification of her child-support order.  She submitted a request for modification in \nOctober 2024.  Ex. 1, ¶35; Ex. 7, Request for Modification. \n52.  Defendant DFCS informed Ms. Martinez that Defendant DFCS would \ngive her an answer by early April 2025.  Ex 1, ¶35. \n53.  Ms. Martinez went to the DFCS office to inquire about the status of her \nrequest for modification in early April 2025.  Id. at ¶36. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 12 of 57\n54.  At that time, Ms. Martinez was told that in order for the request for \nmodification to be processed and considered, she would need to produce adoption \ncertificates for her two daughters who had been adopted.  Id. at ¶37. \n55.  Ms. Martinez went to the court to attempt to get those certificates and \nwas told by the clerk that she had no right to such documents because the adoptions \nwere closed and she no longer had any parental right to her children.  Id. at ¶38. \n56.  Because Ms. Martinez and her partner cannot afford child-care for their \ntwo children, Ms. Martinez cares for their children full time, receiving no income.  \nHer partner’s income is their total household income, and a significant portion of \nthat goes to making Ms. Martinez’s support payments.  Id. at ¶32. \n57.  Ms. Martinez lives with the constant fear that, because she cannot \nafford to make her child-support payments, the children she lives with will be \nremoved from her care.  Id. at ¶39. \nB.  Defendants DFCS, DCSS, and DHS Trap Parents in a Cycle of \nPoverty \n \n58.  Defendants first tear families apart, arguing parents are too poor to \nparent, then charge those same indigent parents for the foster care of their children.  \nThis irrational system renders parents incapable of curing the poverty status that \nDefendant DFCS claims is the basis for removal in the first place. \n59.  Defendants DFCS and DCSS have the authority to enforce, or chose \nnot to enforce, child-support orders against parents. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 13 of 57\ni.  Defendant  DFCS  Removes  Children  from  Their  Families \nSolely Because of Poverty \n \n60.  Between fiscal years 2018 and 2022, children were removed from over \n700 Georgia homes for “inadequate housing.”  This accounted for nearly 20% of the \ntotal removals in the state during that time.  https://www.propublica.org/article/ \ngeorgia-housing-assistance-foster-care  \n61.  This reason for removal rests almost entirely on poverty.  According to \nthe Georgia Maltreatment Codes, published by DFCS, “inadequate housing” can be \nalleged for situations of disrepair, overcrowding, or, in the case of Ms. Martinez and \nher daughters, homelessness.  https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws/_attachments/  \nappendix-c/maltreatment-codes.pdf, p. 6. \n62.  Additionally, the Maltreatment Code criteria for inadequate food and \nclothing indicates that, where a parent fails to provide food or clothing due to an \ninability to afford such items, DFCS may refer to state-sponsored or private services \nto ameliorate food or clothing inadequacies.  Id.  This option does not insulate poor \nfamilies from separation but does provide the potential for grace and charity where \nfood and clothing are lacking. \n63.  Unlike food or clothing, there is no exception, no assistance, and no \nalternative option for inadequate housing.  Id. \n64.  Defendant  DFCS’s  policies  subject  poor  families  in  Georgia  to \nseparation and child-welfare involvement solely because they are poor.  The state \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 14 of 57\nwould more readily remove a child from their home and place them in foster care \nthan provide adequate support to remedy the manifestations of poverty. \nii.  DFCS and DCSS Offer No Indigency Relief from Payment \nObligations \n \n65.  In Georgia,  Defendants  DFCS and DCSS work together to assess, \nenforce, and collect child-support from parents of children in foster care.  Georgia \nDivision of Family and Children Services Child-Welfare Policy Manual, Chapter \n9.12 “Child Support,” effective date August 2024. \n66.  In August 2024, DFCS adopted new guidance on when to enforce or \nnot enforce collection of child-support for children in foster care.  Id. \n67.  Typically,  DFCS  is  responsible  for  making  child-support \nrecommendations, or recommendations for enforcement of preexisting orders, for \nchildren in foster care.  DCSS then honors those recommendations through its \nenforcement efforts.  Since the August 2024 guidelines, DFCS will only make a \nreferral to DCSS for child-support enforcement if a parent “abdicates their parental \nresponsibility . . . and refuses to engage in case planning and reunification,” a support \norder is already in place “when the child enters foster care,” or “there is a new child \nsupport order from the juvenile court subsequent to the child entering foster care.”  \nId. \n68.  Under the August 2024 guidelines, DFCS will “periodically assess . . . \nwhether establishing, enforcing, or continuing to enforce child support will prevent \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 15 of 57\nor delay reunification.”  Id. \n69.  This  guidance  does  nothing  to  give  relief  from  support  orders \nestablished prior to August 2024.  https://www.wabe.org/georgia-child-support-debt \n-foster-care/.    Those  under  the  pre-August  2024  policy  still  face  unaffordable \ndemands for payment that lack any consideration for ability to pay. \n70.  With  the  August  2024  change,  Defendants  recognize  that  the \nenforcement of child-support prevents and delays reunification. \n71.  Despite this recognition, Defendants still will not consider ability to pay \nfor parents with older child-support orders with regard to the enforcement of child-\nsupport payments. \n72.  Even  considering  the  new  DFCS  guidance,  the  language  does  not \nexplicitly require that ability to pay be taken into account when determining whether \nto enforce child-support payments, only that it must be “periodically assessed.”  \nGeorgia Division of Family and Children Services Child-Welfare Policy Manual, \nChapter 9.12 “Child Support,” effective date August 2024. \n73.  This policy does not require any action be taken if it is found that \nenforcing child-support will in fact delay or prevent reunification. \n74.  Despite Ms. Martinez having zero income during most of the time her \nchildren were in foster care, Defendant DCSS continues to send  Ms. Martinez \nenforcement letters, threaten her with incarceration, and impede her efforts to create \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 16 of 57\na suitable home for her children with exorbitant child-support charges and ever-\nincreasing arrears. \niii.  Exorbitant  Child-Support  Payments  Frustrate  Non-\nCustodial Parents’ Reunification Efforts \n \n75.  In  2019,  when  her  current  child-support  order  was  entered,  Ms. \nMartinez was homeless, only sporadically employed, and had recently extricated her \nfamily from a domestic violence situation.  Ex. 1.  \n76.  While the instructions she received were unclear, Ms. Martinez knew \nthat adequate housing was essential to regain custody of her children. \n77.  Even when parents have the financial wherewithal to make timely \nchild-support payments for children in foster care, the payments can themselves \nfrustrate parents’ efforts to pursue reunification. \n78.  DFCS  requires  parents  to  have  separate  bedrooms  for  children  of \ndifferent genders and discourages parents from sharing rooms with even their same \ngender  children.    https://www.propublica.org/article/in-georgia-inadequate-\nhousing-can-mean-longer-stays-in-foster-care. \n79.  Between  fiscal  years  2018  and  2022,  cases  that  cited  “inadequate \nhousing” as a reason for removal took three months longer to achieve reunification \nthan cases alleging abuse without housing instability.  Id. \n80.  DFCS may also decline to approve multigenerational family or housing \nthat does not have a formalized lease.  Id. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 17 of 57\n81.  As low-income parents struggle to make child-support payments, that \nmoney is directed away from their efforts to meet the stringent housing requirements \nof DFCS. \n82.  Furthermore, if reunification is not achieved within 15 months, federal \nlaw directs states to pursue termination of parental rights and adoption.  42 U.S.C. § \n670(1)(4). \n83.  When parents are unable to devote their full resources to creating a \nlifestyle and environment that is appropriate for their children, the time between \nremoval and reunification is extended, and the possibility of reunification may be \nremoved entirely, as was the case for Ms. Martinez. \niv.  August 2024 Policy Change \n84.  In 2023, the federal government issued new guidance on when to assess \nand collect child-support from parents for children placed in foster care. https:// \ncwpm.acf.gov/citations/title-iv-e/title-iv-e-general-title-iv-e-requirements/title-iv-\ne-general-title-iv-e-1, 8.4C. TITLE IV-E, General Title IV-E Requirements, Child \nsupport;  https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_interest/child_law/project-\nareas/legal-representation/shifting-federal-guidance-on-mandatory-child-support-\norders/. \n85.   Federal policy states that “[i]t is almost never the case that securing an \nassignment of the rights to child support is in the best interest of the child.”  The \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 18 of 57\nguidance further explains that “[i]t’s likely that reducing the income of the child’s \nparent(s) could impede their ability to engage in reunification efforts, potentially \nextending  the  time  the  child  spends  in  foster  care.”  https://cwpm.acf.gov/ \ncitations/title-iv-e/title-iv-e-general-title-iv-e-requirements/title-iv-e-general-title-\niv-e-1, 8.4C. TITLE IV-E, General Title IV-E Requirements, Child support. \n86.  This federal guidance encourages agencies to abandon the practice of \ndetermining the appropriateness of  child-support on a “case-by-case basis” and \nreplace that with “across-the-board policies” that “reflect that an assignment of the \nrights to child support for children in title IV-E foster care is not required except in \nvery rare instances.”  Id. (emphasis added).     \n87.  In August 2024, Defendant DFCS updated its child-support policies for \nchildren in foster care.  https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws/09-12. \n88.  Defendant  DFCS’s  updated  guidance  closely  follows  the \nrecommendations of the federal government. \n89.  Defendant DFCS’s updated 2024 guidance includes under its “Practice \nGuidance” a section on “Reasons for Limiting Child Support Referrals.”  Id. \n90.  This section echoes the federal guidance, stating that  child-support \nreferrals would only be appropriate in “cases where there will be no adverse impact \non the successful achievement of the child’s permanency plan of reunification.”  Id.  \n91.  Defendant DFCS’s Practice Guidance further states that “[r]educing the \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 19 of 57\nincome of the parent(s) could impede their ability to engage in reunification efforts, \npotentially extending a child’s time in foster care.”  This guidance mirrors the federal \nguidance nearly word-for-word.   Id. \n92.  The DFCS Practice Guidance also states that “Georgia law also allows \nDCSS to request a modification to the collection of child-support based on a child’s \npermanency plan if the child-support may impede the parent’s ability to establish a \nhousehold and prepare for the child’s return.”  Id. \n93.  Despite DFCS’s recognition of the harm child-support inflicts on poor \nfamilies, this August 2024 guidance does nothing for parents who had child-support \norders in place prior to August 2024, and Defendants continue to harm families \nthrough  outdated  enforcement  practices.    https://www.wabe.org/georgia-child-\nsupport-debt-foster-care/. \n94.  Because the current guidance does nothing to relieve ongoing orders \nalready in place, DFCS and DCSS currently operate under two different policies: \nparents whose children were removed after August 2024 receive consideration on \nhow child-support will impact their reunification plan, while families with earlier \nremovals are given no consideration as DCSS pursues the collection of child-support \nfrom them. \nLEGAL VIOLATIONS \nA.  Defendants’ Still-Enforced Prior Policy Violates Substantive Due \nProcess Because It Infringes on Indigent Parents’ Fundamental \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 20 of 57\nRights  Without  Being  Narrowly  Tailored  to  a  Compelling \nGovernment Interest and Is Not the Least Restrictive Means of \nFurthering that Interest \n \n95.  In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), the Supreme Court \nheld that “the child is not the mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and \ndirect his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare \nhim for additional obligations.”  Id. at 535. \n96.  In Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 \nU.S. 205 (1972), the Supreme Court affirmed the fundamental right of parents “in \nthe companionship, care, custody, and management” of their children.  Stanley, 405 \nU.S. at 651. \n97.  Defendants’  policy  to  charge  indigent  non-custodial  parents  child-\nsupport for their children in foster care delays and prevents family-reunification, \nthereby burdening this fundamental right and subjecting the policy to strict scrutiny.  \nStanley, 405 U.S. at 651–52. \n98.  When non-custodial parents are forced to pay child-support beyond \ntheir means, it frustrates their ability to achieve other financial benchmarks required \nfor reunification by DFCS and the court. \n99.  A parent with limited income cannot simultaneously pay hundreds of \ndollars in child-support and save money for adequate housing, food, clothing, and \nmedical care for their children. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 21 of 57\n100.  Mounting child-support debt is held against parents by DFCS when \nconsidering family-reunification.  See Georgia Division of Family and Children \nServices Child-Welfare Policy Manual, Chapter 9.12 “Child Support,” effective date \nDecember 2018 (“Documentation of the payment history of parents may be useful \ninformation in preparing for a review, building a case for TRP or documenting \nevidence in a court hearing.”). \n101.  Following the August 2024 policy changes, DFCS recommends that \nperiodic  assessments  occur  regarding  “whether  establishing,  enforcing,  or \ncontinuing to enforce child-support will prevent or delay reunification.”  See Georgia \nDivision of Family and Children Services Child-Welfare Policy Manual, Chapter \n9.12 “Child Support” effective date August 2024. \n102.  Such  language  is  not  included  in  the  pre-2024  guidance,  and  the \nreassessments and grace outlined in the August 2024 guidance are not extended to \nparents with child-support orders issued prior to the August 2024 Policy. \n103.  Defendants’  prevention  or  delay  of  reunification  because  of  non-\ncustodial parents’ inability to pay child-support for their children in foster care \nviolates such parents’ fundamental rights. \n104.  While the August 2024 policy exists and applies to new cases, the \nprevious Policy is still in effect and is controlling for parents whose support orders \nwere  issued  prior  to  August  2024.    https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-\n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 22 of 57\nhousing-assistance-foster-care. \n105.  For parents whose child-support obligations are still based on the pre-\n2024 policy, the stringent child-support requirements frustrate, delay, and, in some \ncases, entirely prevent reunification with their children, thereby infringing on their \nfundamental right to parent. \n106.  Because Defendant DFCS’s policy infringes on a fundamental right, it \nis  subject to strict  scrutiny,  must be  narrowly  tailored  to  further  a  compelling \ngovernment interest, and must do so in the least restrictive means possible.  San \nAntonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973). \n107.  Reimbursement  for  foster  care  is  never  listed  as  a  goal  of  the \ndepartment or division, and the current policy of enforcement for pre-2024 exists in \ndirect  conflict  with  the  state  interests  expressed  by  DHS  and  DFCS’s  public \nstatements.    https://dfcs.georgia.gov/about-us/blueprint-family-first/vision-child-\nwelfare-georgia#:~:text=Georgia's%20Blueprint%20for%20Family%20First%20is \n%20our%20state's%20plan%20for,families%20for%20a%20stronger%20Georgia.  \n108.  Defendants may have some interest in being reimbursed for the funds \nthey provide to foster families, but the state’s published “Blueprint for Family First” \nindicates that reimbursement is not, in fact, the compelling state interest at play. \n109.  The “Vision for Child Welfare in Georgia” section of the “Blueprint for \nFamily First” states that the goal is “family preservation” and that DFCS will “use \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 23 of 57\nthe Family First Act to support [its] goal of keeping children with their families by \noffering  evidence-based  services  that  help  address  some  of  the  root  causes \nresponsible for many children entering foster care.”  https://dfcs.georgia.gov/about-\nus/blueprint-family-first/vision-child-welfare-georgia#:~:text=Georgia's%20 \nBlueprint%20for%20Family%20First%20is%20our%20state's%20plan%20for,fam\nilies%20for%20a%20stronger%20Georgia. \n110.  Furthermore, Defendant DFCS recognizes that “[r]esearch has shown \nthat the trauma that accompanies family separation often results in a lifetime of \nemotional and psychological problems.  When we can provide support that allows \nchildren and youth to grow up safely in their own homes, we build a path towards \nstronger families and brighter futures for our young people.”  Id. \n111.  DFCS recognizes the trauma and harm that can come from family \nseparation and the need for family-reunification. \n112.  In the case of Ms. Martinez, her child-support debt became so large and \noverwhelming that she, at the urging of Defendant DFCS, surrendered her rights to \nher children, shattering any hope of eventual reunification and causing irreparable \ntrauma for her children and herself. \n113.  Furthermore,  Defendant  DFCS  recognizes  that  child-support \nenforcement has the power to delay and prevent reunification and actively made \nchanges to the enforcement policy to allow for prevention of such delays in the \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 24 of 57\nfuture, yet it failed to apply this policy to all parents despite the recognized harms. \n114.  Defendant DFCS’s pre-2024 policy prevents reunification and operates \ncontrary to the stated goals of Defendant DFCS. \n115.  When the stated goals of Defendant DFCS are family continuity and \nreunification, it cannot be said that Defendants DFCS, DCSS, or DHS have a \ncompelling interest in enforcing a policy that is in direct opposition with those goals. \n116.  Strict scrutiny also requires that, even if the collection of child-support \nis a compelling state interest, the policy must be narrowly tailored to achieve that \ninterest. \n117.  Defendant DFCS’s policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve any such \ninterest. \n118.  The pre-2024 Policy for foster care child-support makes no distinction \nbetween parents who can and cannot afford child-support nor how child-support \nenforcement should be handled if it will ultimately delay reunification. \n119.  Even if the state’s interest is being reimbursed, punishing parents who \ncannot afford their child-support does nothing to effectuate said reimbursement. \n120.  Furthermore, by frustrating parents’ reunification efforts, the state must \ndirect additional funds towards the care of foster children as they spend more time \nin the foster system. \n121.  Defendants’ means of achieving reimbursement frustrate Defendants’ \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 25 of 57\nown goals. \n122.  Defendant DFCS’s pre-2024 policy also prevents indigent parents from \ndiverting what slim resources they have to achieving the benchmarks they must meet \nin order to regain custody.  This policy forces children to remain in foster care longer \nthan they otherwise would, thereby increasing the burden on the state to reimburse \nfoster families for the care of those children. \n123.  Furthermore, Defendants’ policy is overly restrictive in its failure to \nconsider the ability of non-custodial parents to pay, in addition to the lack of leniency \nin Defendants’ recommendations and enforcement. \n124.  Because  Defendants’  policy  is  not  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  a \ncompelling state interest by the least restrictive means, and it infringes on the \nfundamental rights of parents, Defendants violate substantive due process, and the \npolicy is unconstitutional. \nB.   Defendants Still-Enforced Prior Policy Violates Equal Protection \nBecause  It  Disparately  Impacts  the  Fundamental  Rights  of \nIndigent Parents \n \n125.  As written, Defendant DFCS’s pre-2024 policy applies universally — \nto all parents of children in foster care — but functionally it operates only to restrict \nthe rights of indigent parents to regain custody of their children. \n126.  A state action that infringes on a fundamental right is subject to strict \nscrutiny, regardless of whether it affects a suspect or quasi-suspect class.  E.g., Carey \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 26 of 57\nv.  Population  Serv.  Int’l,  431  U.S.  678,  686  (1977)  (“[W]here  a  decision  as \nfundamental as whether to bear or beget a child is involved, regulations imposing a \nburden on it may be justified only by compelling state interests, and must be narrowly \ndrawn to express only those interests.”). \n127.   Depriving individuals of equal rights solely because of their inability \nto pay is wealth-based discrimination.  See, e.g., Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, \n667 (1983) (holding that probation cannot be revoked because a probationer is unable \nto pay restitution); see also Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 18 (1956) (prohibiting \ndenial of access to appeal solely because of inability to pay court costs). \n128.  Under the pre-2024 policy, Defendants DFCS and DCSS enforce child-\nsupport  payments,  delay  reunification,  and  threaten  non-custodial  parents  with \nincarceration without any determination of whether the nonpayment was willful or \nthe individuals were simply too poor to pay. \n129.  Defendants DFCS and DCSS promulgated and enforced a punitive \nscheme that inevitably results in parents being deprived of their fundamental rights \ndue to their inability to pay. \n130.  By depriving parents of a fundamental right solely for their inability to \npay, Defendants DFSC and DCSS engage in wealth-based discrimination in violation \nof equal protection. \n131.   Defendants fail to narrowly tailor their policy to achieve a compelling \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 27 of 57\nstate interest by the least restrictive means because Defendants prevent indigent \nparents from regaining custody of their children while also expending government \nresources on collection efforts and continued foster care of the children of such \nparents. \n132.  Defendants DHS and DFCS state several compelling interests in their \nmission and on their websites.   The stated interests include the preservation of \nfamilies, family-reunification, and addressing the “root causes” that contribute to \nchildren being placed in foster care. \n133.  Enforcement for the purpose of reimbursement directly conflicts with \nthe published interests and goals expressed by DHS and DFCS’s public statements.  \nhttps://dfcs.georgia.gov/about-us/blueprint-family-first/vision-child-welfare-georgia \n#:~:text=Georgia's%20Blueprint%20for%20Family%20First%20is%20our%20state\n's%20plan%20for,families%20for%20a%20stronger%20Georgia. \n134.  In its “Practice Guidance,” Defendant DFCS recognizes the harms \nchild-support  collections  can  cause  in  preventing  parents  from  achieving \nreunification goals and prolonging family separation. https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs \n/cws/09-12/#reasons-for-limiting-child-support-referrals. \n135.  Defendant DFCS and DHS’s own statements and policy changes made \nin August 2024 exhibit an understanding that the former (but still-enforced) policy is \nnot narrowly tailored to the interests they have espoused. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 28 of 57\n136.  Furthermore, were the policy narrowly tailored, it would not be causing \noutsized harm for indigent parents and poor families. \n137.  Even if the recoupment of money paid for the care of foster children is \na compelling interest, the fact that it sweeps up parents who cannot afford to pay and \nplaces them in the same category as parents who willfully refuse to pay indicates that \nDefendants have not narrowly tailored the policy to achieve those means. \n138.  Punishing poor parents by delaying reunification or creating additional \nhurdles to regaining custody of their children is not the least restrictive means of \nensuring that the state has money for foster care. \n139.  If poor parents do not have money to pay child-support, continuing to \nbill them, threatening them with incarceration, and keeping their children from them \nwill not suddenly make them able to pay. \n140.  Defendants’ previous policy, which is still enforced against parents \nwith pre-2024 child-support orders, unconstitutionally deprives poor parents of the \nfundamental right to parent and is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \nC.   Defendants  Violate  Equal  Protection  by  Failing  to  Apply  the \nAugust 2024 Policy to Similarly Situated Parents with Support \nOrders Issued Before 2024 \n \n141.  As stated in City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., “[t]he Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall ‘deny \nto any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,’ which is \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 29 of 57\nessentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.”  473 \nU.S. 432, 439 (1985). \n142.  In August 2024, Defendants DFCS and DCSS published new policy \nguidelines on when to enforce child-support for children in foster care; these new \nguidelines limit enforcement when doing so would “prevent or delay reunification.”  \nhttps://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws/09-12/. \n143.  Since enacting this policy, Defendants DFCS and DCCS have only \napplied the limitations on enforcement to new child-support orders and have declined \nto apply the policy in cases where child-support orders were issued prior to August \n2024.  https://www.wabe.org/georgia-child-support-debt-foster-care/. \n144.  Defendants DFCS and DCSS violate equal protection by declining to \nenforce the policy to all parents, creating two groups of similarly situated individuals \nwho are separated only by the arbitrary distinction of the date their child-support \norder was entered. \n145.  As these are similarly situated individuals, and Defendants divide them \nonly by the inception date of their child-support order, the constitutionality of the \napplication of the August 2024 policy must be assessed on rational basis review and \n“need only be rationally related to legitimate government interests.”  Box v. Planned \nParenthood of Indiana & Kentucky, Inc., 587 U.S. 490, 491 (2019). \n146.  While  the  threshold  for  rational  basis  review  is  low,  Defendants’ \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 30 of 57\ndecision to not apply the August 2024 policy to all does not survive it. \n147.  Under City of Cleburne, “[t]he State may not rely on a classification \nwhose relationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to render the distinction \narbitrary or irrational.”  473 U.S. at 446 (internal citation omitted). \n148.  Here, Defendants’  distinction  is  completely  arbitrary  and  irrational \nwhen considering the aims of the August 2024 policy. \n149.  Defendants created the August 2024 policy in the wake of the federal \nguidance which it mirrors, recognizing that family separation is harmful and that \ncontinued enforcement of child-support orders may delay or prevent reunification. \n150.  The trauma and hardship of family separation on both children and \nparents is no different simply because their particular support order predates the \nAugust 2024 policy. \n151.  Furthermore, indigent parents are no better equipped to pay their child-\nsupport and succeed in reunifying with their children simply because their particular \nsupport order predates the August 2024 policy. \n152.  Even if Defendants DFCS and DCSS did indicate that their goal was \nreimbursement and not limiting trauma, Defendants cannot expect to get blood from \na stone, and parents are not any more likely to suddenly be able to afford support \norders that they have been struggling to pay simply because their particular support \norder predates the August 2024 policy. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 31 of 57\n153.  Defendants’ failure to apply the August 2024 policy  to all parents \ncreates two distinct groups of similarly situated individuals, separated only by the \nhappenstance of time; Defendants have no rational basis on which to rest this decision \nand, as such, it is an unconstitutional violation of equal protection. \nD.   Defendants Violate Procedural Due Process by Failing to Consider \nAbility to Pay When Assigning and Enforcing Child-Support for \nChildren in Foster Care \n \n154.  Individuals have a property interest in their own money that cannot be \ntaken away without due process of law.  Nelson v. Colorado, 581 U.S. 128, 135 \n(2017); see also Lee v. Christian Coal. of Am., Inc., 160 F. Supp. 2d 14, 32 (D.D.C. \n2001) (finding that financial injury resulting in “[t]he inability to pay utility bills or \nto feed one’s children or the risk of being evicted from one’s home, amounts to \nirreparable injury”); Resnick v. KrunchCash, LLC, 34 F.4th 1028, 1030 (11th Cir. \n2022) (“[E]ven a temporary or partial deprivation of property without proper notice \nor a hearing violates due process.”).  Due Process requires Defendants to conduct a \npre-deprivation ability-to-pay hearing and to provide notice that such hearings are \navailable. \n155.  The pre-deprivation hearing must contemplate ability to pay.  Because \nDefendants delay and limit family-reunification due to failure to pay child-support, \na meaningful hearing in this context is one that determines whether the nonpayment \nwas willful, as willfulness speaks directly to ability to pay. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 32 of 57\n156.  An ability-to-pay hearing must be available before DCSS engages in \nenforcement actions. \n157.  Under the  current  policy,  DFCS  and  DCSS  considerations are  not \npublic, there is no notice that DFCS and DCSS are considering whether to enforce \nchild-support orders, and impacted parents have no opportunity to be heard. \n158.  Presently, parents may have an opportunity to be heard at the time \nchild-support is ordered, but, as in Ms. Martinez’s case, this is inadequate and does \nnot contribute to the DFCS and DCSS decision as to enforcement of such orders.  \nEx. 1, Martinez Decl. \n159.  Due process also requires that all parents facing delayed reunification \nfor unpaid child-support receive adequate notice that a hearing is available and that \nthey have the opportunity to raise inability to pay as a defense at that hearing. \n160.  Prior to delaying reunification, DFCS and DCSS provide no notice \ninforming parents of any right to raise ability-to-pay as a defense. \n161.  The current method of applying for reconsideration does nothing to \nimpact existing payments and debt, is not sufficiently publicized, and is not an \nadequate means of assessing ability-to-pay in the event of non-willful nonpayment. \n162.  Furthermore, DFCS and DCSS do not independently review parents’ \nability to pay prior to enforcement if those parents’ support orders were entered prior \nto the August 2024 policy taking effect.  Thus, Defendants delay and prevent \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 33 of 57\nreunification without considering ability to pay. \n163.  In addition to failing to consider ability to pay when enforcing child-\nsupport, DCSS threatens incarceration for unpaid child-support, regardless of ability \nto pay. This results in incarceration for non-willful nonpayment, depriving parents \nof their fundamental liberty rights for reasons of poverty.  See Ex. 1 & 2. \n164.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits  incarceration  for  non-willful \nfailure to make monetary payments.  See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 667 \n(1983); Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, \n244 (1970); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 19 (1956). The right to freedom from \ndetention is fundamental, and the United States Supreme Court has never wavered \nfrom the principle that “[f]reedom from imprisonment — from government custody, \ndetention, or other forms of physical restraint — lies at the heart of the liberty that \n[the Due Process] Clause protects.”  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001). \n165.  Given this fundamental right to liberty, any attempt to deprive someone \nof their liberty — including through incarceration for failure to make a monetary \npayment — is subject to heightened scrutiny.  See Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 719–20 (1997) (the Due Process Clause “provides heightened protection \nagainst  government  interference  with  certain  fundamental  rights  and  liberty \ninterests” such as freedom from government detention). \n166.  Defendant DCSS’s threats of incarceration do not meet this heightened \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 34 of 57\nstandard.  Liberty cannot hinge on ability to pay, and Defendant’s attempts to \nimprison non-custodial parents for failure to pay  child-support is not narrowly \ntailored to serve a compelling government interest. \n167.  Defendant DCSS uses the threat of jail time to coerce non-custodial \nparents into paying child-support.  Ex. 5. \n168.  Defendant  DCSS  offers  no  opportunity  for  these  parents  to  raise \nindigency as a defense to the accusations of non-payment and threat of incarceration. \n169.  As such, Defendant DCSS threatens incarceration for failure to pay \nchild-support, regardless of ability to pay. \n170.  Because Defendants DFCS and DCSS do not provide a pre-deprivation \nability-to-pay hearing for parents facing child-support enforcement, there is a high \nrisk that parents will be deprived of their fundamental right to raise their own \nchildren for reasons of poverty. \n171.  Furthermore, Defendant DCSS’s failure to consider ability to pay when \nthreatening incarceration for nonpayment violates due process. \nE.   Defendants Violate Due Process by Failing to Adjust Plaintiff’s \nChild-Support After Her Children Reached the Age of Majority or \nWere Adopted \n \n172.  Plaintiff surrendered her parental rights to six of her children.  Of those \nsix children, three have reached the age of majority (18), two have been adopted, \nand one has a pending adoption. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 35 of 57\n173.  Despite five of these six children no longer being in foster care or \nreceiving funding from the state as foster children, DFCS and DCSS continue to \ncharge Plaintiff the same amount of child-support she was originally assigned. \n174.  Defendants are aware that these five children are no longer in the care \nof the foster system but have made no changes to Plaintiff’s child-support obligation. \n175.  Defendants allow no adequate procedure for correcting this erroneous \ndeprivation. Defendants’ procedures for reconsideration are not well publicized, \nslow, and legally impossible at times. \n176.  Defendant DCSS allegedly employs a process for re-review of support \namounts.  Plaintiff was unaware of this process until five years into her child-support \nobligation and has been unable to effectively engage with the process due to legally \nimpossible requirements set by Defendants. \n177.  Defendants require that Ms. Martinez obtain documentation she has no \nlegal right or access to in order to even begin a review of her request.  Her request \nwas pending for over a year before Ms. Martinez was made aware of the requirement \nto obtain these sealed documents.  See Ex. 1, Decl. Martinez., ¶¶35–38. \n178.  Defendant  DCSS  holds  the  authority  to  review  and  modify  child-\nsupport amounts based on the requests for review. \n179.  Plaintiff has a property interest in her money and is entitled to due \nprocess with regard to Defendant’s enforcement of child-support and deprivation of \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 36 of 57\nthat money. \n180.  Plaintiff is entitled to a procedure that is tailored to safeguard her \ninterests from erroneous deprivation.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 348-49 \n(1976). \n181.  Under Mathews v. Eldridge, the sufficiency of procedures may be \nassessed by considering: “(1) the private interest that will be affected by the official \naction;  (2)  the  risk  of  an  erroneous  deprivation  of  such  interest  through  the \nprocedures used, and probable value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards; and \n(3) the Government's interest, including the fiscal and administrative burdens that \nthe additional or substitute procedures would entail.”  Id. at 321. \n182.  Here, the focus is on the erroneousness of the deprivation and value of \nadditional procedural safeguards. \n183.  Defendants DFCS and DCSS credit child-support payments made by \nbiological parents directly to the support of their children in foster care. \n184.  If children are no longer in foster care, by reason of age or adoption, \nthen  Defendants  are  no  longer  responsible  for  their  care,  and  Defendants’ \ndeprivation of parents’ property has no connection to such care. \n185.  Absent  a  connection  to  the  care  of  foster  children,  Defendants’ \ndeprivation of parents’ property is entirely erroneous. \n186.  Given that Plaintiff has been erroneously deprived of her property, it is \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 37 of 57\nclear  that  the  current  process  afforded  to  parents  is  insufficient,  and  there  is \nsignificant value in additional procedural safeguards including, but not limited to, \nperiodic reassessment of child-support orders and reassessment at the moment of \nqualifying events such as adoptions or eighteenth birthdays. \n187.  Defendants violate due process by failing to guard against the risk — \nand reality — of erroneous deprivation and must implement additional procedural \nsafeguards to meet the burden the Constitution requires of them. \nF.   Defendants  Violated  State  Law  by  Illegally  Charging  Plaintiff \nChild-Support After Her Children Reached the Age of Majority or \nWere Adopted \n \n188.  Plaintiff has six children of whom she does not have custody and has \nsurrendered her parental rights. \n189.  Of those six children, three have reached the age of majority and left \nthe foster care system, two have been adopted, and one has a pending adoption. \n190.  Ms. Martinez’s three eldest children turned 18 in January 2025, January \n2022, and August 2021, respectively. \n191.  Plaintiff surrendered her rights to these children in December 2019. \n192.  Pursuant to Georgia Code Section 19-6-15(e), covering the “[d]uration \nof child support responsibility,” the obligation “to provide support for a minor child \nshall continue until the child reaches the age of majority, dies, marries, or becomes \nemancipated, whichever first occurs.” \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 38 of 57\n193.  The only exception to child-support ending at the age of majority is for \na child over the age of 18 who is still enrolled in secondary school and who attains \nthe  age  of  majority  before  completing  secondary  school,  “provided  that  such \nfinancial assistance shall not be required after a child attains 20 years of age.”  GA \nCode § 19-5-15(e) (2024).  To the best of Ms. Martinez’s knowledge, this exception \ndoes not apply to any of her children. \n194.  Additionally, the Chapter 9.9, Section 1(a) of Defendant DFCS’s Policy \nManual states that a child is only eligible for Title IV-E foster care reimbursement \namounts when the child is under 18 years of age.  https://pamms.dhs.ga.gov/dfcs/cws \n/09-09/. \n195.  Chapter 9.9 of the Policy Manual also lists “Fatal Flaws with IV-E,” \nexplaining “circumstances [that] are fatal to IV-E eligibility; i.e., the child loses IV-\nE eligibility and reimbursability for the entire placement . . . in foster care.”  One \nsuch circumstance is when the child reaches age 18.  Another is when DFCS custody \nis terminated through adoption.  Id. \n196.  Ms. Martinez’s three eldest children are all over the age of 18 and are \nno longer eligible for Title IV-E payments from the state.  There is no public benefit \nfor  which  the  state  could  be  collecting  child-support  from  Ms.  Martinez  as \nreimbursement. \n197.  Defendants DFCS and DCSS continue to charge Ms. Martinez the same \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 39 of 57\namount of child-support ($472 per month) despite half of her non-custodial children \nturning 18, contrary to Georgia law and DFCS policy. \n198.  With regard to Ms. Martinez’s adopted children, DFCS Policy Manual \nChapter 9.9, Section 1(c) states that a child is not eligible for foster care maintenance \npayments unless they live in a reimbursable placement.  Reimbursable placements \nare foster homes, childcare facilities, or residential treatment facilities.  Id. \n199.  Adoptive homes are not foster homes and thus are not reimbursable \nplacements. \n200.  Additionally, Chapter 9.9 lists termination of DFCS custody as a “fatal \ncircumstance” for support payments.  Id. \n201.  Adoption  terminates  state  custody;  an  adopted  child  is  no  longer \neligible for child-support payments. \n202.  With regard to her adopted children, there is no public disbursement for \nwhich Ms. Martinez should be required to reimburse the state. \n203.  Furthermore,  GA  Code  §  15-11-261(a)  states  that  “[a]n  order \nterminating the rights of a parent . . . shall divest the parent and his or her child of \nall legal rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations with respect \nto each other except: (1) the right of such child to receive child-support from his or \nher parent until a final order of adoption is entered.” \n204.  A final order of adoption has been entered for two of Ms. Martinez’s \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 40 of 57\nchildren.  As such, she is no longer obligated to pay child-support for those children. \n205.  Ms.  Martinez  should  have  been  relieved  of  the  child-support \nrequirement for two of her remaining three underaged, non-custodial children when \nthe adoptions became final. \n206.  Ms. Martinez’s child-support amount has not changed to reflect these \nadoptions. \n207.  Only one of Ms. Martinez’s six non-custodial children remains in foster \ncare and eligible for child-support, but her payment amount has never been adjusted. \n208.  Ms. Martinez is still being charged unjustifiable and erroneous amounts \nof child-support in violation of Georgia statute and DFCS Policy. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n209.  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff \nAnnalinda Martinez brings this action on behalf of herself and all others similarly \nsituated, as representative of the following classes: \n210.  Indigent Class: All indigent persons who are or have been charged \nchild-support for children in foster care, pursuant to the pre-August 2024 policy \npromulgated and enforced by the Georgia Department of Human Services, Georgia \nDivision of Family and Children Services, and Division of Child Support Services. \n211.  Adult-and-Adopted-Children Class: All persons who are or have been \ncharged child-support for children in foster care whose children have reached the \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 41 of 57\nage of majority and concluded secondary school or have been adopted, and who \nwere charged child-support after the time at which those children reached the age of \nmajority and concluded secondary school or were adopted. \n212.  As described below, each class satisfies the prerequisites of numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation required by Rule 23(a)(1), \n(2), (3), and (4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to proceed as a class action. \n213.  Because of the risk of inconsistent adjudications or prejudice to absent \nclass members, as well as the request for injunctive relief and damages, the proposed \nclasses also meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), (2), and (3). \nA.  Numerosity: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n \n214.  The persons in the proposed classes are so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.  Each class is composed of hundreds to thousands of \nmembers. \n215.  For example, between 2018 and 2022 over 700 children were removed \nfrom homes where parents were likely indigent and incapable of making child-\nsupport payments.  Considering those years, in addition to prior years and the years \nsince 2022, the number of individuals in the indigent class likely numbers in the \nthousands. \n216.  Given  the  difficulties  Plaintiff  has  had  with  her  request  for \nreconsideration, and the present impossibility of her success, it is likely that the \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 42 of 57\nadult-and-adopted-children class is in the hundreds, if not thousands. \n217.  Ascertainability  of  the  exact  number  of  class  members  is  readily \nachievable through analysis of Defendants’ records. \nB.  Commonality: Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n \n218.  Relief sought by the indigent class is common to all class members: \nceasing enforcement of child-support for children in foster care where parents are \nunable  to  make  such  payments due to indigency  and  such enforcement  would \nprevent or delay family-reunification, so as to protect the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs and class members now and in the future. \n219.  Relief sought by the adult-and-adopted-children class is common to all \nclass members: ceasing the practice of charging parents the same amount in child-\nsupport when one or more of their non-custodial children has reached the age of \nmajority and is no longer enrolled in secondary school or has been adopted, and to \nreimburse parents of such children unjustly charged under that practice. \n220.  There are also issues of law and fact common to the classes.  Among \nthe common issues of fact for the indigent class are: \na.  Do Defendants have control over the child-support fees so as to \nmake the decision to not enforce those fees? \nb.  Do Defendants have control over relevant policies so as to alter \nthose policies to provide relief for indigent parents? \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 43 of 57\nc.  Do Defendants enforce the pre-August 2024 policy against class \nmembers? \nd.  Do Defendants frustrate, delay, or prevent family-reunification \nthrough enforcement of the pre-August 2024 policy? \ne.  Do Defendants’ policies impact indigent parents and families \ndifferently from parents with adequate means to pay? \nf.  Do Defendants threaten non-custodial parents with incarceration \nfor failure to pay child-support regardless of ability to pay? \ng.  Do  Defendants  incarcerate  parents  for  failure  to  pay  child-\nsupport regardless of ability to pay? \nh.  Does Defendants’ enforcement of the policy impact reunification \nfor indigent parents when non-indigent parents do not experience \nthe same delays? \n221.  Among the common issues of fact for the adult-and-adopted-children \nclass are:  \na.  Do Defendants continue to charge parents for child-support when \nthey no longer have qualifying children benefitting from the \nfoster care system? \nb.  Do Defendants fail to modify child-support when children no \nlonger qualify for state disbursements? \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 44 of 57\nc.  Do  Defendants  frustrate  or  prevent  parents  from  requesting \nmodifications when their children reach the age of majority or \nare adopted? \n222.  Among the common issues of law for the indigent class are:  \na.  Do Defendants violate due process by enforcing the pre-August \n2024 policy against indigent parents? \nb.  Do Defendants violate equal protection by enforcing the pre-\nAugust 2024 policy against indigent parents? \nc.  Do Defendants violate equal protection by enforcing the pre-\nAugust 2024 policy against parents with child-support orders \nearlier than August 2024 while exempting parents with child-\nsupport orders established after August 2024? \n223.  Among the common issues of law for the adult-and-adopted-children \nclass are:  \nd.  Do Defendants violate federal due process by charging child-\nsupport for children who have aged out of foster care or been \nadopted?  \ne.  Do Defendants violate state statutes by charging child-support \nfor children who have aged out of foster care or been adopted?  \nC.  Typicality: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 45 of 57\n224.  Plaintiff Annalinda Martinez has an active child-support order for six \nchildren who were or are currently in foster care.  Defendants continue to enforce \nPlaintiff’s child-support order.  Plaintiff has no income of her own.  Plaintiff has \nsuffered harms in the same way as the other members of the classes.  Plaintiff’s \nclaims are typical of the proposed classes. \n225.  All class members are subject to child-support obligations for children \nin foster care. \n226.  All class members are required to make child-support payments for \nchildren in foster care. \n227.  All indigent class members are indigent. \n228.  All members of the adult-and-adopted-children class have children who \nhave aged out or been adopted out of foster care and have child-support obligations \nthat have not been altered to reflect that change.  \n229.  Defendants enforce child-support obligations against all class members \nwithout consideration of ability to pay. \n230.  Defendants enforce child-support obligations against all class members \nwithout consideration of the impact of such enforcement on family-reunification. \n231.  Defendants  enforce  child-support  obligations  against  all  class \nmembers, regardless of the age and adoption status of their non-custodial children.  \nD.  Adequacy: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) and 23(g) \n \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 46 of 57\n232.  Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the classes.  \nPlaintiff has no claim agnostic to those of the classes.  In support of this proposition, \nPlaintiff would show that: \n233.  Plaintiff is a member of the proposed classes;  \n234.  Plaintiff has an interest in representing the proposed classes; \n235.  Plaintiff has no interest adverse to the rest of the classes; and  \n236.  Plaintiff has suffered the same harm as the proposed classes. \n237.  Class counsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Equal Justice Under Law and \nDarice Good of Good Legal Firm, LLC.  Equal Justice Under Law attorneys have \nexperience in litigating complex civil rights matters in federal court, particularly \nwith  regard  to  wealth-based  discrimination.    Good  Legal  Firm,  LLC  attorneys \npossess similar experience, with the addition of significant practice in Georgia \ncourts.  Class counsel has extensive knowledge of the relevant constitutional and \nstatutory law.  Class counsel also has a detailed understanding of state law and \ncounty practices as they related to federal constitutional requirements. \n238.  Counsel  has  devoted  significant  time  and  resources  to  becoming \nintimately familiar with how the Georgia Department of Human Services, Division \nof Family and Children Services, and Division of Child Support Services operate, \nspecifically as to charging child-support and the consequences of non-payment of \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 47 of 57\nsuch child-support.  Counsel have also developed relationships with some of those \nvictimized by Defendants’ practices.  The interests of class members will be fairly \nand adequately protected by the Plaintiff and her attorneys. \nE.  Predominance and Risk of Inconsistent Adjudications: Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(b)(1) \n \n239.  The common questions of fact and legal issues applicable to each \nindividual member of the proposed classes are identical.  The prosecution of separate \nsuits by individual members of the proposed class would create risk of inconsistent \nadjudications of the legal issues and would establish incompatible standards of \nconduct  for  any  party  opposing  the  class.    Common  questions  of  law  or  fact \npredominate over any question affecting only individual class members.  Nothing \nshort of a universally-applied remedy to all members of the classes would address \nthe allegations set forth in this complaint. \nF.  Injunctive and Declaratory Relief: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \n \n240.  The indigent class seeks injunctive and declaratory relief under Rule \n23(b)(2) to enjoin Defendants from acting under the prior policy, specifically as to \nenforcing child-support orders where they would not be enforced under the August \n2024  policy.    Such  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  is  appropriate  because \nDefendants have acted in the same unconstitutional manner with respect to all class \nmembers and an injunction and declaration prohibiting Defendants from enforcing \nchild-support under the prior policy would provide relief to every class and subclass \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 48 of 57\nmember. \n241.  The adult-and-adopted-children class seeks injunctive and declaratory \nrelief  under  Rule  23(b)(2)  to  enjoin  Defendants  from  enforcing  child-support \nobligations  for  adult  or  adopted  children  who  no  longer  qualify  for  state \ndisbursements, and to  affirmatively require Defendants to modify child-support \nobligations to reflect these changes as Defendants become aware of them. \n242.  The classes also seek damages from Defendants for child-support that \nthey have been charged unconstitutionally and contrary to the authorizing statutes, \nand for which they have paid. \n243.  A class action is superior to any other available method for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy.  All class members are subject to child-\nsupport obligations and DFCS and DCSS policies.  Individual adjudications would \nbe inefficient and risk inconsistent rulings, despite every adjudication turning on the \nsame policies — specifically, Defendants’ practice of implementing the pre-August \n2024 policy for parents with child-support orders predating that policy. \nG.  Damages: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) \n244.  This case is significantly more manageable as a class action than as \nindividual adjudications because of the common issues of fact and law, which \npredominate over minor individual differences between class members. \n245.  A  class  action  is  superior  to  all  other  methods  of  adjudication  as \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 49 of 57\ndamages in this case will be calculated in the same manner for all class members. \n246.  Class members have limited interest in individually controlling the \nprosecution or defense of separate actions. \n247.  Pursuant to  Counsel and Plaintiff’s current knowledge, there is no \nlitigation on this matter that has already  been initiated by or against any class \nmembers.  \n248.  Due to Defendants’ status as statewide operators, it is desirable and \neconomical to concentrate the litigation of these claims to a particular forum.  \n249.  Thus, certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One: \nDue Process Violation of the Fundamental Right to Parent \n \n250.  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  each  and  all  of  the  previous \nallegations in this Complaint. \n251.  Defendants’  unconstitutional  actions  are  subject  to  strict  scrutiny \nbecause they impact and restrict Plaintiff’s fundamental right to parent. \n252.  Therefore, Defendants’ policy must be narrowly tailored to achieve a \ncompelling state interest and must do so by the least restrictive means. \n253.  Defendants’ child-support policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve the \nstated goals of reunification and family support because it makes struggling parents \nless likely to achieve the benchmarks required of them to regain custody of their \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 50 of 57\nchildren. \n254.  Defendants’ child-support policy is not narrowly tailored to the best \ninterest of children because it increases the known trauma of family separation by \ndelaying reunification and threats of delayed reunification and incarceration are no \nmore likely to enable poor parents to make their child-support payments. \n255.  Because Defendants’ policy is not narrowly tailored to any compelling \nstate interest, it violates substantive due process. \nCount Two:  \nEqual Protection Violation for Wealth-Based Discrimination \n \n256.  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  each  and  all  of  the  previous \nallegations in this complaint. \n257.  Defendants  violate  equal  protection  by  discriminating  against \nindividuals on the basis of wealth-status in such a way that impacts their fundamental \nright to parent. \n258.  Because Defendants’ discrimination impacts a fundamental right, their \nactions are subject to strict scrutiny, and must be narrowly tailored to achieve a \ncompelling state interest by the least restrictive means. \n259.  Defendants’ policy disparately impacts poor parents’ ability to achieve \nreunification with their children in foster care through enforcement of child-support \norders. \n260.  Defendants’ child-support policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve the \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 51 of 57\nstated goals of reunification and family support because it makes struggling parents \nless likely to achieve the benchmarks required of them to regain custody of their \nchildren. \n261.  Defendants’ policy does nothing to increase the likelihood that poor \nparents will be able to make child-support payments and achieve reunification. \n262.  Defendants’ policy disparately impacts the fundamental rights of poor \nparents  who  cannot  afford  child-support  by  hampering  their  ability  to  achieve \nrequired  benchmarks  to  regain  custody  of  their  children  and  by  delaying \nreunification for unpaid child-support. \n263.  Defendants’ policy does not have the same impact on the fundamental \nrights of wealthier parents, who are able to pay child-support, achieve the required \nbenchmarks without financial hardship, and whose reunification is not delayed by \ntheir inability to make payments. \n264.  Because Defendants’ policy is not narrowly tailored to any compelling \nstate interest and discriminates on the basis of wealth, it violates equal protection. \nCount Three: \nEqual Protection Violation for Distinguishing between Parents \nBefore and After August 2024 Policy \n \n265.  Defendants  violate  equal  protection  by  applying  the  August  2024 \npolicy differently to two arbitrarily defined groups of similarly situated individuals. \n266.  Defendants have no rational basis for refusing to apply the August 2024 \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 52 of 57\npolicy to all individuals with child-support orders for children in foster care. \n267.  Defendants’ purpose in creating the August 2024 policy was to alleviate \nthe  burden  of  child-support  enforcement  on  indigent  parents  and  facilitate \nreunification in recognition of the hardships child-support orders created for poor \nparents seeking to achieve reunification. \n268.  The fact that some indigent parents have child-support orders put in \nplace before August 2024 makes them no more capable of paying child-support, and \nno less vulnerable to the harms of child-support enforcement and family separation. \n269.  Defendants’ failure to apply the August 2024 policy to all parents is \narbitrary, has no rational basis, and is a violation of equal protection. \nCount Four: \nViolation of Due Process for Failure to Assess Ability to Pay \nPrior to Enforcement of Child-Support  \n \n270.  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  each  and  all  of  the  previous \nallegations in this complaint. \n271.  Defendants’  policy  that  enforces  child-support  payments  violates \nprocedural due process because it does not guarantee an ability-to-pay assessment \nor provide that notice of such an assessment be provided. \n272.  Defendants also threaten incarceration for failure to pay child-support \nwith no ability-to-pay assessment or opportunity to raise ability to pay as a defense. \n273.  Plaintiff and others similarly situated have protected property interests \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 53 of 57\nin their own money. \n274.  Parents are constitutionally entitled to an ability-to-pay assessment and \nnotice of that assessment prior to Defendants enforcing child-support and delaying \nor preventing family-reunification. \n275.  Defendants DFCS and DCSS’s policy authorizes the deprivation of \nproperty and liberty interests without adequate due process because it does not \nguarantee  an  ability-to-pay  assessment  for  all  parents  facing  child-support \nenforcement, delayed reunification, and threatened incarceration, and it does not \nmandate that all such parents be notified of their right to assert ability to pay as a \ndefense. \nCount Five:  \nViolation of Procedural Due Process for Charging Erroneous Child-Support \n \n276.   Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  each  and  all  of  the  previous \nallegations in this complaint. \n277.  Defendants  have  continued  to  charge  Plaintiff  child-support  for \nchildren who are no longer in the custody of the foster care system and are no longer \nreceiving the benefits of such child-support payments. \n278.  Under Mathews v. Eldridge, this deprivation of Plaintiff’s property \nviolates due process. \n279.  Plaintiff’s  interest  in  retaining  her  funds  is  high,  as  she  has  two \ncustodial children at home. The risk of erroneous deprivation is unacceptable and \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 54 of 57\nongoing. The state has no countervailing interest in Plaintiff’s money because the \nbenefits for which it would be used are no longer being paid out. \n280.  Defendants fail on each and every part of the analysis under Mathews \nand as such violate due process by failing to adjust Plaintiff’s child-support order \nfollowing the qualifying events of her children reaching the age of majority and \nbeing adopted. \nCount Six:  \nViolation of GA Code § 19-6-15(e) and GA Code § 15-11-261(a) \n \n281.  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  each  and  all  of  the  previous \nallegations in this complaint. \n282.  Pursuant to GA Code § 19-6-15(e) and GA Code § 15-11-261(a), \nparents are not to be charged child-support payments for children who are no longer \nreceiving the benefit of such payments in foster care by nature of reaching the age \nof majority or being adopted. \n283.  Defendants continued to charge Plaintiff the same, unadjusted amount \nof foster care despite five of her six children no longer being eligible due to their age \nor adoption. \n284.  Plaintiff has made active attempts to have her child-support adjusted, \nand Defendants have refused, requiring Plaintiff to produce documents to which she \nhas no legal right.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 55 of 57\n285.  Defendants are aware of the ages of the children and their adoption \nstatus and continue to charge Plaintiff the same amount of child-support. \n286.  Defendants have not made support payments for five of the six children \nin foster care in years, but continue to charge Plaintiff child-support that can only be \njustified if it is directed towards the care of those children. \n287.  Defendants’ continued enforcement of Plaintiff’s child-support order is \nillegal. \nREQUESTED RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that the Court issue the following relief: \na.  A  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  acts, \nand/or  omissions  as  described  herein  are  unlawful  and  violate \nPlaintiff’s and Class Members’ rights under the Constitution and laws \nof the United States; \nb.  An  order  and  judgment  preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoining \nDefendants, their subordinates, agents, employees, representatives, and \nall others acting or purporting to act in concert with them or on their \nbehalf from enforcing child-support orders under the pre-August 2024 \npolicy; \nc.  An  order  and  judgment  preliminarily  and  permanently  ordering \nDefendants to apply the August 2024 policy to all individuals with \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-04686-TRJ     Document 1     Filed 08/19/25     Page 56 of 57\nchild-support orders or children in foster care; \nd.  An  order  and  judgment  preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoining \nDefendants from charging child-support where children have reached \nthe age of majority or been adopted; \ne.  An order for damages compensating Plaintiff (and class members) for \nthe money Defendants have erroneously deprived through Defendants’ \nfailure to adjust child-support and adequately consider ability to pay; \nf.
