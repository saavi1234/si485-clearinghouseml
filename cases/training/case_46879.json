          "description": "MINUTE ORDER: Pursuant to Local Rule 7(n)(1), the Court ORDERS the Government to file the administrative record in this case by August 14, 2025, at 12:00 PM. The administrative record is necessary at this stage so the Court can review the full record before the agency at the time it made its decision and make a reasoned and considered decision in this case. That is precisely why the D.C. Circuit has held that district courts must \"require[] the [agency] to file the administrative record\" \"before assessing [the] probability of success on the merits\" for an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim on a preliminary injunction motion. Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 243 F.3d 579, 582 (D.C. Cir. 2001). If the Government is unable to file the administrative record by August 14, 2025, at 12:00 PM, it should file a notice by August 13, 2025, at 5:00 PM, advising the Court of (1) why it cannot meet that deadline, and (2) when it anticipates being able to file the administrative record. Signed by Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan on 8/12/2025. (lcdl)"

    "summary": "<p>This case challenges the Trump Administration&rsquo;s travel ban governing nationals of numerous countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Trump Administration&rsquo;s Jan. 25, 2025, Executive Order 14161, &ldquo;Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,&rdquo; directed the Secretary of State to identify countries whose travel screening information is so deficient that suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries is appropriated under section 212(f) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)). After receiving the report, on June 4, 2025, the President fully or partially suspended admission from nineteen countries, including Afghanistan, Burma, Togo, Somalia, and Iran, from entry into the United States, in a document known as Proclamation 10949.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs, 102 nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Togo, Somalia, and Iran, sought to benefit from the diversity visa program provided for in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). See 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1151(e), 1153(c)(1). The relevant provision of the INA creates an annual allotment of immigrant visas reserved for individuals from countries with &ldquo;low rates of immigration&rdquo; to the United States. Of the 102 Plaintiffs, 55 were selected through the diversity program for the chance to receive fiscal year 2025 visas and 47 are their derivative beneficiaries. After years of waiting and processing, they received emails informing them they had been found &ldquo;ineligible for an immigrant visa under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, pursuant to&rdquo; Proclamation 10949.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on July 22, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a writ of mandamus, an injunction, and relief under the Administrative Procedure Act against Proclamation 10949. Their complaint that alleges the Proclamation 10949 and the Department of State&rsquo;s subsequent implementation resulted in 1) the unlawful failure to adjudicate some Plaintiffs&rsquo; diversity visa applications, and 2) the unlawful refusal of some Plaintiffs&rsquo; applications.</p>\r\n<p>At midnight on September 30, 2025, the Plaintiffs eligibility to receive visa for the fiscal year of 2025 will lapse. Consequently on July 31, 2025, Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction that: 1) directs the Defendants to adjudicate their visas prior to the deadline, 2) prevents Defendants from refusing their visa applications based on what Plaintiffs see as an &ldquo;erroneous interpretation of the INA,&rdquo; and 3) void some the visa refusals under the Presidential Proclamation the Defendants already issued to some of the Plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After an August 15, 2025 motion hearing, the court issued an order granting the requested preliminary injunction in part. The court ordered the Secretary of State to undertake &ldquo;good-faith efforts&rdquo; to \"expeditiously process and adjudicate&rdquo; the Plaintiffs&rsquo; applications by the September 30, 2025 deadline. In addition, the court preliminary enjoined the Secretary of State from issuing visa-application refusals based on &ldquo;8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(f), Proclamation 10949, or any guidance instructing consular officers to refuse visas based on Subsection 1182(f).&rdquo; The court also ordered Defendants to file a status report with the Court on August 28, 2025 and every seven days thereafter to update the Court on their progress processing Plaintiff&rsquo;s visa applications. 2025 WL 2418402. The status reports are not available on the electronic docket, so we do not know what they say.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 19, 2025, defendants appealed the preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Sooknanan \n \n \nDONALD J. TRUMP, President of the \nUnited States, et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThe Plaintiffs in this case are 102 nationals of Afghanistan, Burma, Togo, Somalia, and \nIran, who seek to benefit from the diversity visa program provided for in the Immigration and \nNationality Act (INA). See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(e), 1153(c)(1). Fifty-five of the Plaintiffs were \nselected through the program for the chance to receive fiscal year 2025 visas, and forty-seven are \ntheir derivative beneficiaries. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have either failed to \nadjudicate their diversity visa applications or unlawfully refused them because of a Presidential \nProclamation that suspends entry into the United States by individuals from their home countries. \nAnd the Plaintiffs face a looming deadline. At midnight on September 30, 2025, their eligibility to \nreceive fiscal year 2025 diversity visas will expire. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs seek a preliminary \ninjunction (1) that directs the Defendants to adjudicate their pending visa applications before \nSeptember 30, 2025, (2) that prevents the Defendants from refusing their pending applications \nbased on what the Plaintiffs contend is an erroneous interpretation of the INA, and (3) that voids \nthe allegedly unlawful visa refusals some of the Plaintiffs have received based on the Presidential \nProclamation. The Court grants in part and denies in part the Plaintiffs’ motion. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 2 of 40\nBACKGROUND \nA.  The Diversity Visa Program \nThe INA “creates an annual allotment of immigrant visas” for individuals from countries \n“with low rates of immigration to the United States.” Goodluck v. Biden, 104 F.4th 920, 921 (D.C. \nCir. 2024). These visas, called “diversity visas,” are capped at 55,000 each fiscal year.1 See \n8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(e), 1153(c)(1). Eligible applicants enter a “lottery” for that fiscal year’s visas. \nGomez v. Trump (Gomez I), 485 F. Supp. 3d 145, 159 (D.D.C. 2020). “Demand regularly outstrips \nsupply,” with millions of people applying for the relative handful of available visas. Id. \nLottery winners,  called “selectees,”  “are not guaranteed to receive a  visa—only the \nopportunity to apply for one.” Rai v. Biden, 567 F. Supp. 3d 180, 186 (D.D.C. 2021), rev’d on \nother grounds, Goodluck, 104 F.4th 920. Selectees “must submit a full, written application for an \nimmigrant visa and must personally appear for an interview before a consular officer.” Goodluck, \n104 F.4th at 922. And if an applicant meets all the requisite criteria to obtain the visa, “the State \nDepartment ‘shall’ issue him” one. Almaqrami v. Pompeo, 933 F.3d 774, 777 (D.C. Cir. 2019) \n(first citing 8 U.S.C. § 1153(c), (e)(1); then citing 22 C.F.R. §§ 40.6, 42.81(a); and then citing \n8 U.S.C. § 1202(h)). \nSelection for a diversity visa, however, comes with a strict time limit: selectees are “eligible \nto receive [the] visa only through the end of the specific fiscal year for which they were selected.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(I)(ii)(II). Thus, selectees must secure their visa by September 30 of the year \nof their selection, or they lose their eligibility. Almaqrami, 933 F.3d at 777. Put another way, “when \nmidnight strikes at the end of the fiscal year, those applicants without visas are out of luck.” \n \n1 Although 55,000 diversity visas are available by statute, 5,000 of those visas are reserved for \nindividuals covered by the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997, \nPub. L. No. 105–100, 111 Stat. 2193 (1997). \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 3 of 40\nGoodluck, 104 F.4th at 925 (quoting Yung-Kai Lu v. Tillerson, 292 F. Supp. 3d 276, 282 (D.D.C. \n2018)). \nSelectees who receive a visa “may travel to the United States and seek admission.” Id. \nat 922 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1181(a)). But “[l]ike any other visa, a diversity visa does not guarantee \nadmission.” Id. It only gives the individual “permission to arrive at a port of entry and have an \nimmigration officer independently examine the alien’s eligibility for admission.” Id. (quoting \nSaavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d 1153, 1157 (D.C. Cir. 1999)). If issued, diversity visas are \ngenerally valid for six months after issuance. 8 U.S.C. § 1201(c)(1). \nB.  The Diversity Visa Adjudication Process \nThe diversity visa program is administered out of the Department of State’s Kentucky \nConsular Center (KCC). See 9 Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) 502.6-4(c)(1)(a); see also Rai, 567 \nF. Supp. 3d at 187 (laying out the diversity visa adjudication process). Selectees must submit a \nform and supporting documentation to the KCC. See 9 FAM 502.6-4(d)(1)(a), (b). \nCongress  has  directed  that  “[a]ll  immigrant  visa  applications  shall  be reviewed  and \nadjudicated by a consular officer.” 8 U.S.C. § 1202(b). By regulation, such applications are made \nwhen  the  applicant  “personally  appear[s]  before  a  consular  officer  and  verif[ies]”  that  the \nstatements in the applicant’s paperwork are true, after “having previously submitted all forms and \ndocuments . . . and paid the visa application processing fee.” 22 C.F.R. § 40.1(l)(2). Accordingly, \nthe KCC schedules interviews for diversity-visa selectees. See 9 FAM 502.6-4(c)(1). Consular \nofficers are directed that their decision to “issue or refuse an [immigrant visa] application must be \nbased on [that] interview, during which [the consular officer] must ensure that all required \ndocumentation has been provided, that there is a legal basis for the applicant to immigrate, and \nthat there are no ineligibilities that would affect visa issuance.” 9 FAM 504.1-3(f). By regulation, \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 4 of 40\n“[a] visa can be refused only upon a ground specifically set out in the law or implementing \nregulations.” 22 C.F.R. § 40.6. \n“When a visa application has been properly completed and executed before a consular \nofficer in accordance with the provisions of the INA and the implementing regulations, the \nconsular officer must issue the visa, [or] refuse the visa[.]”2 22 C.F.R. § 42.81(a). A consular \nofficer cannot “temporarily refuse, suspend, or hold the visa for future action.” 9 FAM 504.1-3(g). \nIf the officer refuses the visa, the officer “must inform the applicant of the provisions of law on \nwhich the refusal is based.” Id. \nC.  Proclamation 10949 \nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order 14161, titled \n“Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public \nSafety Threats.” 90 Fed. Reg. 8451 (January 20, 2025). In that executive order, the President \ndirected several officials, including the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, to submit a \nreport identifying countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to \nwarrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to \nsection 212(f) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)).” Id. at 8451. \nAfter receiving the report from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials, \nPresident Trump issued Proclamation 10949. 90 Fed. Reg. 24497, 24499 (June 4, 2025). Invoking \nhis authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), the President fully or partially suspended the entry into the \nUnited  States  of  individuals  from  nineteen  countries,  including  Afghanistan,  Burma,  Togo, \nSomalia, and Iran. Id. \n \n2 The officer may also “discontinue granting the visa” “pursuant to an outstanding order under \nINA 243(d),” an outcome that is not relevant in this case. 22 C.F.R. § 42.81(a). \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 5 of 40\nOn June 6, 2025, after the President issued Proclamation 10949, the Department of State \nsent implementing guidance to all diplomatic and consular posts worldwide. Admin. R. (AR) \nCIV010, ECF No. 19. That guidance informed consular officers that they should “first determine \nwhether [an] applicant is otherwise eligible for a visa under the INA, without regard to the \n[Proclamation.]” AR CIV014. But even if an applicant is otherwise eligible for a visa, if she is \n“subject to [the Proclamation]” she “must be refused . . . , unless [she] qualifies for one of the \n[Proclamation’s] narrowly defined exceptions.” AR CIV010. More specifically, for any applicants \nfrom countries subject to the Proclamation, officers “must refuse under INA 212(f)” any applicant \nnot subject to an exception. AR CIV012–CIV013. That guidance accords with the Department’s \nForeign Affairs Manual, which lists ineligibility for entry under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) as a basis for \nrefusing a visa application. 9 FAM 301.4-1(a). \nD.  Factual Background \n“The following facts are alleged in the Complaint or drawn from declarations in the record \nthat are not disputed in relevant part, except where otherwise noted.” Postal Police Officers Ass’n \nv. U.S. Postal Serv., 502 F. Supp. 3d 411, 415 (D.D.C. 2020). \nThe Plaintiffs are fifty-five selectees for the fiscal year 2025 diversity visas (DV-2025) and \nforty-seven  of  their  derivative  beneficiaries.  Compl.  ¶ 437.  Each  of  them  is  a  national  of \nAfghanistan, Burma, Togo, Somalia, or Iran—countries named in Proclamation 10949. Id. The \nPlaintiffs were informed of their selection for the DV-2025 program in May 2024, and each \nproceeded through the application process by submitting the necessary forms and paying the \nrequisite fees. Id. ¶¶ 439–41. \nAll of the Plaintiffs attended their DV-2025 interviews with consular officials at their \nrespective embassies. Id. ¶ 442. At the conclusion of their interviews, consular officials approved \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 6 of 40\nthe applications of eighteen of the Plaintiffs (the Approved Plaintiffs), who were then issued their \nDV-2025 visas.3 Id. ¶ 443. But for the other eighty-four Plaintiffs (the Non-Approved Plaintiffs), \nconsular officials said that their application “would have to undergo mandatory administrative \nprocessing.” Id. ¶ 444. The Non-Approved Plaintiffs’ applications were refused under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1201(g) and placed in administrative processing. Id. When the Non-Approved Plaintiffs checked \ntheir visa application status on the Department of State’s website, it reported their status as “refused \nfor administrative processing.” Id. ¶ 447. The website stated that the “case[s] will remain refused \nwhile undergoing such processing [and] will receive another adjudication once such processing is \ncomplete.” Id. \nFollowing the issuance of Proclamation 10949, some of the Non-Approved Plaintiffs \ncontacted the relevant U.S. embassy and inquired about the status of their applications. Id. ¶ 448. \nSome of those Plaintiffs received an email informing them that a consular officer had found them \n“ineligible for an immigrant visa under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \npursuant to” Proclamation 10949. Id. ¶ 449. The Plaintiffs who received this response also had a \nnew visa-application status reflected on the Department of State website: “A U.S. consular officer \nhas adjudicated and refused your visa application. Please see the letter you received at the \ninterview.” Id. ¶ 450. \n \n3 These are Plaintiffs Parastoo Shoorche, Sarisa Ahmadi, Narjes Heydari, Zaynab Sadat Hassani, \nMasoumeh Jabbarzadeh, Nina Nejatbakhsh, Fereshteh Farzadfar, and Sara Bozorgmehr.

Procedural Background \nThe Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in this Court on July 22, 2025, against President Donald J. \nTrump  and  Secretary  of  State  Marco  Rubio.  ECF No. 1.  The  Complaint  alleges  that \nProclamation 10949 and the Department of State’s implementing guidance have resulted in both \n(1) the unlawful failure to adjudicate some Plaintiffs’ DV-2025 applications, and (2) the unlawful \nrefusal of other Plaintiffs’ DV-2025 applications. See Compl. ¶¶ 503-613. The Complaint seeks a \nwrit of mandamus, an injunction, and relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). \nId.¶¶ A–M. On July 31, 2025, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. ECF No. 11. \nThe Motion is fully briefed and ripe for review. See Defs.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 16; Pls.’ Reply, \nECF No. 20. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). To obtain a preliminary injunction, the movant must show that (1) “he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits”; (2) “he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief”; (3) “the balance of equities tips in his favor”; and (4) “an injunction is in the \npublic interest.” Id. at 20. The latter two factors “merge when the Government is the opposing \nparty.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nDISCUSSION \nA.  Likelihood of Success \nThe Plaintiffs must first show that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. \nThe Court begins with assessing whether the Plaintiffs’ claims are justiciable, and then it addresses \nwhether they have shown the requisite likelihood of success on their claims. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 8 of 40\n1.  Justiciability \n“The merits on which a plaintiff must show a likelihood of success encompass not only \nsubstantive theories but also establishment that the action is justiciable.” Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d \nat 169 (cleaned up) (quoting Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. \n2015)). The Defendants assert that the Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden on justiciability for three \nreasons: (a) the Plaintiffs lack standing, (b) the Plaintiffs lack a cause of action, and (c) the \nPlaintiffs’ claims are barred by the doctrine of consular non-reviewability. The Court finds both \nstanding and a cause of action at this stage. And although there is likely no obstacle to the Court’s \nreview of the claims brought by the Plaintiffs whose applications are undergoing administrative \nprocessing, the Plaintiffs whose applications were refused without further processing have not \nshown a likelihood that their claims can survive the doctrine of consular non-reviewability. \na.  Standing \n“To  establish  standing,  the  plaintiff  must  show  (1) it  has  suffered  a  ‘concrete  and \nparticularized’ injury (2) that is ‘fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant’ and \n(3) that is ‘likely’ to be ‘redressed by a favorable decision,’ i.e., a decision granting the plaintiff \nthe relief it seeks.” Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. Presidential Advisory Comm’n on Election Integrity, \n878 F.3d 371, 376–77 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting West v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 1228, 1230 (D.C. Cir. \n2017)). “In the context of a preliminary injunction motion, we require the plaintiff to show a \nsubstantial likelihood of standing under the heightened standard for evaluating a motion for \nsummary judgment.” Id. at 377 (cleaned up). “Thus, the plaintiff cannot rest on mere allegations, \nbut must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts that, if taken as true, demonstrate a \nsubstantial likelihood of standing.” Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 560–61 (1992)). “[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 9 of 40\nand for each form of relief that is sought.” Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) (quotation \nmarks omitted) (quoting DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006)). But “[t]o \nestablish jurisdiction, the court need only find one plaintiff who has standing.”4 Mendoza v. Perez, \n754 F.3d 1002, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \nThe Plaintiffs’ Complaint asserts seven causes of action. Compl. ¶¶ 503-613. They seek \nessentially three forms of relief: (1) an order requiring the Defendants to adjudicate the Plaintiffs’ \nvisa applications before September 30, 2025; (2) an order prohibiting the Department of State from \ndenying the Plaintiffs’ applications because of Proclamation 10949; and (3) an order voiding the \nrefusals for the Plaintiffs whose visa applications have been adjudicated and denied because of \nProclamation 10949. See Compl. ¶¶ A–M; Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (Mot. for PI) at 43. For \npurposes of this discussion, the Court will refer to two groups of Plaintiffs: the “Administrative-\nProcessing Plaintiffs,” who claim their visa applications have not been adjudicated because they \nare undergoing administrative processing, and the “Denied Plaintiffs,” whose applications have \nbeen adjudicated and denied because of Proclamation 10949.5 \nThe Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs “have not established their evidentiary burden” \nto show that they have standing to seek these forms of relief. Defs.’ Opp’n at 13. Specifically, the \nDefendants argue that the Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently establish injury and redressability. \nId. at 12–13. The Court addresses each of these arguments in turn. \n \n4 Because the Court concludes that the Non-Approved Plaintiffs have established standing for each \nclaim pressed and each form of relief sought, the Court need not address whether the Approved \nPlaintiffs have standing. \n5 At oral argument, the Department of State represented that only two individuals fall into the \ncategory that the Court is calling the “Denied Plaintiffs,” and that there are eighty-two individuals \nwho fall into the category the Court is calling the “Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs.” See \nMotions Hr’g (Aug. 15, 2025), Rough Tr. at 9:11–20, 10:2–5. The Plaintiffs did not dispute that \nrepresentation. See id. at 6:14–18. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 10 of 40\nFirst, injury. The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial \nlikelihood of injury for each form of relief they seek. The Denied Plaintiffs seek to have their \ndenials voided, and all of the Plaintiffs want to avoid a visa denial because of Proclamation 10949. \nThese claims are grounded “in traditional harms that are obviously concrete:” the “lost professional \nopportunities, forced separation from family members, and difficulty accessing medical care” that \naccompany a visa-application denial. Ranjan v. DHS, 747 F. Supp. 3d 192, 199 (D.D.C. 2024); \nsee, e.g., Decl. of Aye Aye Thein ¶ 38 (describing separation from her brother); Decl. of Koffi \nFabrice Djondo ¶¶ 18–28 (describing effect on educational opportunities); Decl. of Abdiqadir \nOmar Barre ¶ 13 (describing difficulties accessing required specialized medical treatment); see \nalso Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 698 (2018) (“We agree that a person’s interest in being \nunified with his relatives is sufficiently concrete and particularized to form the basis of an \nArticle III injury in fact.”). This is sufficient to establish injury at this stage.6 \nNext, the Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs have satisfactorily shown that they have \nbeen injured by the Government’s alleged failure to adjudicate their visa applications. These \nPlaintiffs assert “a procedural injury”: the withholding of what they claim to be “statutorily \nmandated, non-discretionary review and adjudication of [their] visa applications.” Gomez I, 485 \nF. Supp. 3d at 171. And “[t]his procedural deprivation is paired with a concrete interest—[the \n \n6 Indeed, the Defendants do not dispute that these Plaintiffs have been injured by their visa-\napplication refusals. They state only that “the law provides no duty to re-adjudicate a visa \napplication after it has been refused.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 12. Wisely, the Defendants do not couch \nthis argument in terms of standing. As the Supreme Court has explained, issues of jurisdiction such \nas standing are different than “the legal availability of a certain kind of relief,” see Chafin v. Chafin, \n568 U.S. 165, 174 (2013), which “goes to the merits,” Almaqrami v. Pompeo, 933 F.3d 774, 780 \n(D.C. Cir. 2019). So although other justiciability issues—e.g., the doctrine of consular non-\nreviewability, which the Court discusses below—may ultimately forbid a plaintiff from obtaining \nrelief, these concepts are different than standing. See Dep’t of State v. Muñoz, 602 U.S. 899, \n908 n.4 (2024) (“[T]he doctrine of consular nonreviewability is not jurisdictional[.]”). \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 11 of 40\nAdministrative-Processing Plaintiffs’] interest in obtaining a diversity visa before September 30.” \nId.; see Food & Water Watch, 808 F.3d at 921 (explaining that “[d]eprivation of a procedural right \nwithout some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation—a procedural right in vacuo—\nis insufficient to create Article III standing” (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, \n496 (2009))). \nThe  Defendants  contend  that  the  Administrative-Processing  Plaintiffs  have  already \nreceived the sought-after adjudication of their visa applications; that their applications have \nalready been adjudicated and refused. Defs.’ Opp’n at 12. Thus, the Court encounters one of the \ncentral disagreements between the Parties: were these Plaintiffs’ applications adjudicated when \nthey were refused for administrative processing under 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g), or have consular \nofficials yet to adjudicate the applications? Although this is an important question that the Court \naddresses at length below, it need not detain the Court here for long. That is because “[f]or \npurposes of analyzing plaintiffs’ standing,” courts assume that the plaintiff “would prevail on the \nmerits of their claim.” Estate of Boyland v. USDA, 913 F.3d 117, 123 (D.C. Cir. 2019). So here, \nthe Court assumes that consular officials have a nondiscretionary duty to conclude administrative \nprocessing and adjudicate the Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs’ visa applications. See Janay v. \nBlinken, 743 F. Supp. 3d 96, 107 (D.D.C. 2024) (“For purposes of assessing standing, the Court \nmust ‘assume’ that Plaintiffs ‘will prevail on the merits of their claims unless their arguments that \nthe relief sought is legally available and that [they are] entitled to it is so implausible that it is \ninsufficient to preserve jurisdiction.’” (quoting Sandpiper Residents Assoc. v. HUD, 106 F.4th \n1134, 1140–41, 1142–44 (D.C. Cir. 2024))). \nSecond, redressability. The Defendants contend that the relief the Plaintiffs seek would not \nredress their injuries because (1) an order compelling the Defendants to adjudicate the outstanding \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 12 of 40\nvisa applications would nevertheless result in a denial under Proclamation 10949; and (2) even if \nthe Plaintiffs received visas, they would not be permitted to enter the United States due to that \nsame Proclamation. Defs.’ Opp’n at 13. But these arguments misunderstand the nature of the \nPlaintiffs’ claimed injuries. As discussed above, the Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs raise the \n“procedural injury” of withheld but statutorily mandated “review and adjudication of [their] visa \napplications.” See Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 171. That injury is redressed even if the Government \ndenies the Plaintiffs’ applications. And if the Denied Plaintiffs get what they ask for, they would \nhave another chance of getting a visa and therefore take a “necessary first step on a path that could \nultimately lead to relief fully redressing the injury.” Tel. & Data Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 19 F.3d 42, 47 \n(D.C. Cir. 1994) (quoting Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. EPA, 861 F.2d 270, 273 (D.C. \nCir. 1988). Indeed, because diversity visas generally remain valid for six months, if any of the \nPlaintiffs receive a visa, they will have a six-month window in which the President might rescind \nor cut back on the restrictions imposed by Proclamation 10949. See 8 U.S.C. § 1201(c). No more \nis required to establish redressability. \nIn sum, the Plaintiffs have established “a substantial likelihood of standing,” which is \nsufficient to support their motion for a preliminary injunction. See Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 878 F.3d \nat 377. \nb.  Cause of Action \nThe Defendants recognize that the Plaintiffs have brought APA claims, but they (very) \nbriefly argue that the APA cannot provide the Plaintiffs with a basis for suit. Defs.’ Opp’n \nat 21–22. Section 702 of the APA provides that “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of \n \nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. The Supreme Court has explained \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 13 of 40\nthat “this language establishes a regime under which a plaintiff may not sue unless he falls within \nthe zone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the \nlegal basis for his complaint.” Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 177 (2011) \n(cleaned up). And the Court has described this “zone of interests” test “as denying a right to review \n‘if the plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in \nthe statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.’” Id. \nat 178 (quoting Clarke v. Secs. Indus. Assn., 479 U.S. 388, 399–400 (1987)). \nAt this stage, the Court sees no obstacle here for the Plaintiffs’ APA claims. The Plaintiffs, \nall visa applicants, have argued that the Defendants have failed to adjudicate their applications as \nthe INA requires, denied their applications in contravention of the INA, or issued guidance \ncontrary to the INA. See, e.g., Mot. for PI at 15, 37; Compl. ¶¶ 519–22. These are exactly the sorts \nof interests that make the Plaintiffs “expected to police the interests that the statute protects.” See \nCSL Plasma Inc. v. CBP, 33 F.4th 584, 589 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting Amgen, Inc. v. Smith, 357 \nF.3d 103, 108 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). Nothing more is needed under the zone of interests test. See id. \nAnd given the Parties’ lean briefing on this issue, the Court does not dwell on it further. \nc.  Consular Non-reviewability \nFinally, the Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs’ claims are unreviewable under the \ndoctrine of consular non-reviewability. Defs.’ Opp’n at 15–18. That doctrine “holds that a consular \nofficial’s decision to issue or withhold a visa is not subject to judicial review, at least unless \nCongress says otherwise.” Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d 1153, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1999). \n“But not every legal challenge that touches on the admission or exclusion of foreign nationals is \nforeclosed by consular nonreviewability.” Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 176. “[T]he doctrine of \nconsular nonreviewability is not triggered until a consular officer has made a decision with respect \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 14 of 40\nto a particular visa application.” Nine Iraqi Allies Under Serious Threat Because of Their Faithful \nServ. to the U.S. v. Kerry, 168 F. Supp. 3d 268, 290 (D.D.C. 2016). Accordingly, “[d]istrict courts \nin this jurisdiction consistently have held that when the suit challenges inaction, as opposed to a \ndecision  taken  within  the  consul’s  discretion,”  the  doctrine  does  not  apply.  Gomez  I,  485 \nF. Supp. 3d at 176 (cleaned up). \nJust in describing the doctrine, it is immediately clear that it forbids the relief sought by \nthe Denied Plaintiffs, despite the Plaintiffs’ inexplicable protests at oral argument. See Motions \nHr’g (Aug. 15, 2025), Rough Tr. at 14:5–8, 15:1–5. The Denied Plaintiffs have asked the Court \nfor an order that “set[s] aside . . . any 212(f) refusals given improperly to Plaintiffs.” Mot. for PI \nat 43. Yet review of completed decisions by consular officers is exactly what the doctrine of \nconsular non-reviewability forbids. See Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 1020, 1024 \n(D.C. Cir. 2021) (“Consular nonreviewability shields a consular official’s decision to issue or \nwithhold a visa from judicial review[.]”). Thus, even if their claims are otherwise meritorious, the \nPlaintiffs have not established a likelihood that there is relief the Court can give the Denied \nPlaintiffs. \nThe picture is not nearly so clear with respect to the Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs. \nRecall the basic debate between the Parties about the status of these Plaintiffs’ applications: were \ntheir applications adjudicated when they were refused for administrative processing under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1201(g), or do consular officials still need to adjudicate them? That question is important because \nif the Plaintiffs’ applications have been adjudicated and the Plaintiffs seek to challenge that \nadjudication, the doctrine of consular non-reviewability forbids review; if not, then the Court can \nreach the merits. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 15 of 40\nThis Court is far from the first in this District to address this question. For nearly a decade, \nthe overwhelming consensus view has been that a refusal for administrative processing does not \nmean that a visa candidate’s application has been adjudicated. See, e.g., Janay, 743 F. Supp. 3d at \n112 (concluding that “the factual allegations of the complaint . . . provide a plausible basis to \nconclude that the consular officer has yet to decide whether to grant or to deny” an application that \nwas refused for administrative processing); Augustin v.

Supp. 3d 87, 104 (D.D.C. 2024) (treating a refusal for administrative processing as a \n“definitive action” that was effectively “a dispositive adjudication”); Sedaghatdoust v. Blinken, \n735 F. Supp. 3d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2024) (same). \nThe  Defendants,  however,  contend  that  this  overwhelming  consensus  was  in  fact  a \n“debate” about how to treat administrative-processing cases—a debate that was “ended” by the \nD.C. Circuit’s unpublished opinion in Karimova v. Abate, No. 23-cv-5178, 2024 WL 3517852 \n(D.C. Cir. July 24, 2024). Defs.’ Opp’n at 17. The Court disagrees. \nIn Karimova, the D.C. Circuit considered APA claims brought by a visa applicant whose \napplication had been refused for administrative processing. 2024 WL 3517852, at *2. In the court’s \nwords, a consular officer “reviewed Karimova’s application and interviewed her,” “officially \n‘refused’ her application,” and then “placed her application in administrative processing in order \nto verify qualifications for her requested visa.” Id. (cleaned up). Thus, rather than being a \nwaystation  before  the  adjudication,  the  court’s  view  was  that  a  refusal  for  administrative \nprocessing constitutes “an official decision refusing to issue a visa because the applicant has not \ncarried her burden of showing eligibility.” Id. The ongoing nature of that processing meant only \nthat “the officer can determine sua sponte that the administrative processing is ‘completed’ and \nmay then re-open and re-adjudicate the applicant’s case.” Id. \nFar from “end[ing the] debate,” Defs.’ Opp’n at 17, Karimova has spawned a great deal of \nconfusion. For one, “courts in this district are split on whether unpublished circuit decisions like \nKarimova are binding”—and indeed, whether Karimova specifically is binding. Seifan v. Sweeney, \nNo. 25-cv-261, 2025 WL 2171093, at *3 (D.D.C. July 31, 2025) (laying out cases on each side of \nthe split). And courts have also expressed that Karimova “leaves uncertain the case law in this \nDistrict rejecting application of the consular nonreviewability doctrine where, as here, a plaintiff’s \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 17 of 40\napplication has been ‘refused’ but simultaneously—and confusingly—still subject to further \nadministrative processing.” Mahmoodi v. Altman-Winans, No. 24-cv-2010, 2025 WL 763754, \nat *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025); see also Sereshti v Gaudiosi, No. 24-cv-1288, 2024 WL 4625802, \nat *5 (D.D.C. Oct. 30, 2024). \nThis Court has previously weighed in on the side that Karimova is both not binding and \nnot significantly persuasive.8 Motevali v. Rubio, No. 24-cv-1029, 2025 WL 885116, at *6 & n.4 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2025); see also Hajizadeh v. Blinken, No. 23-1766, 2024 WL 3638336, at *3 n.3 \n(D.D.C. Aug. 2, 2024) (AliKhan, J.) (similar). The Court finds much more persuasive the analysis \nby Judge Randolph Moss in Janay v. Blinken. Judge Moss observed that “the State Department \ncannot elevate form over substance, and, instead, the inquiry must focus on what is actually \nhappening.” 743 F. Supp. 3d at 112 (cleaned up) (quoting Al-Gharawy, 617 F. Supp. 3d at 16). \nJudge Moss reasoned: \nBy analogy, an agency cannot avoid judicial review by, for example, characterizing \na final, operative decision as interlocutory and pending further review, someday. \nBy the same token, the State Department cannot evade its obligation (if any) to \nadjudicate visa applications in a timely manner by characterizing every long-\npending  application  as  “refused,”  even  when  the  consular  officer  is  still \n“administratively processing” and considering whether to grant the application. \nId. Thus, the word “‘refused’ is not a ‘get-out-of-review-free card’ that, regardless of substance, \nsatisfies the consular officer’s duty (if any) to render a timely decision on the application.” Id. \n(quoting Al-Gharawy, 617 F. Supp. 3d at 16). \n \n8 At oral argument, the Defendants suggested that Karimova binds this Court. Motions Hr’g (Aug. \n15, 2025), Rough Tr. at 33:14–24. But a D.C. Circuit panel’s “decision to issue an unpublished \ndisposition  means  that  the  panel  sees  no  precedential  value  in  that  disposition.”  D.C.  Cir. \nR. 36(e)(2); see also Doroodchi v. Rubio, No. 24-cv-3170, 2025 WL 1865114, at *3 (D.D.C. July \n7, 2025) (rejecting the proposition that unpublished D.C. Circuit decisions like Karimova are \nbinding on courts in this District). \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 18 of 40\nTo put a finer point on it, consider another analogy. Imagine that a driver applies for a \nparking permit; the driver fills out all the necessary paperwork, pays a fee, and arrives at a \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles office. The driver submits her application to the DMV clerk and \nasks to get the permit. The clerk looks over the application and determines that everything seems \nto be in order, but he says that he cannot give her the permit until he checks whether the DMV has \nany permits left. He tells the driver that the computer system is running slowly, so she should leave \nfor the day and that he will call her once he has seen whether there is a permit he can give her. But \na month passes, and the clerk has not called the driver about whether there is a permit for her. Has \nthe clerk made a decision about the driver’s application? In one sense, yes: the clerk has made a \ndecision that he could not yet give her the permit and that he needed to see whether he can give \nher one. But in the relevant sense, the clerk has not made the decision about the application. The \ndriver has not gotten a yes-or-no determination from the clerk that puts her application to rest. \nThe import of this analogy should be obvious. When a consular officer decides to refuse a \nvisa-applicant’s application for administrative processing, the officer has certainly made a decision \nabout the application: that the applicant should not yet receive the visa and that more processing \nis required. And if that were the decision that the Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs were \nchallenging here, the Court has no doubt that decision would be shielded by the doctrine of \nconsular  non-reviewability.  But  the  Administrative-Processing  Plaintiffs  are  challenging \nsomething different: that the Department of State has not yet made the decision about their \napplications—the determination that puts their applications to rest.9 So although it is true that the \nAdministrative-Processing Plaintiffs, like the driver, walked out of their respective appointments \n \n9 Indeed, the absence of the Department of State having settled the application is what distinguishes \napplications in administrative processing from applications that have been adjudicated but which \nmay be reconsidered upon request of the applicant. See 22 C.F.R. § 42.81(e). \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 19 of 40\nwith a decision about their application, they, like the driver, never received the all-important \nyes-or-no decision from the reviewing officer about the benefit they sought to obtain. \nWith all respect to the Karimova panel, it failed to appreciate this aspect of “what is actually \nhappening.” Janay, 743 F. Supp. 3d at 112 (quoting Al-Gharawy, 617 F. Supp. 3d at 16). Karimova \nwas certainly correct that an administrative-processing refusal is “an official decision refusing to \nissue a visa.” 2024 WL 3517852, at *2. But the evidence before the Court supports the conclusion \nthat such decisions are different from the decision “whether to grant or to deny” the application. \nJanay, 743 F. Supp. 3d at 112. The Department of State’s online case status report tells the \nAdministrative-Processing Plaintiffs: “If you were informed by the consular officer that your case \nwas refused for administrative processing, your case will remain refused while undergoing such \nprocessing. You will receive another adjudication once such processing is complete.” Compl. \nEx. D (emphases added). “In other words, the application is still being processed and a decision is \nstill forthcoming. It has only been ‘refused’ in the far-from-literal sense that it has not yet been \n‘granted’ or ‘denied.’” Janay, 743 F. Supp. 3d at 112. The Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs \nclaim that the Department of State has unlawfully failed to make that yes-or-no determination. \nAssuming that consular officers have a duty to make such a determination, the Plaintiffs’ challenge \nis therefore to “inaction, as opposed to a decision taken within the consul’s discretion,” and the \nCourt concludes that the doctrine of consular non-reviewability likely does not apply.10 Gomez I, \n485 F. Supp. 3d at 176 (cleaned up). \n \n10 Similarly, because the Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Department of State’s guidance regarding \nProclamation 10949 also does not challenge “an affirmative visa ‘determination,’” the doctrine of \nconsular non-reviewability likely does not foreclose review of that claim either. See Gomez I, 485 \nF. Supp. 3d 145, 159 (D.D.C. 2020). \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 20 of 40\n*          *          * \nIn sum, although the Plaintiffs have sufficiently established that they have standing and a \ncause of action, the Denied Plaintiffs have not shown that their claims will survive the doctrine of \nconsular non-reviewability. The Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs, on the other hand, have \nbrought claims that this Court likely can review. Accordingly, the Court turns next to whether \nthese Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. \n2.  The Administrative-Processing Plaintiffs’ Claims \nThe claims that the Court may consider are twofold: (a) that the Department of State’s \nadjudication of the Plaintiffs’ applications has been “unlawfully withheld” and “unreasonably \ndelayed,”  5  U.S.C.  § 706(1);  and  (b) that  the  Department’s  guidance  implementing \nProclamation 10949 is “not in accordance with law,” id. § 706(2)(A). The Court addresses each in \nturn. \na.  Withholding and Unreasonable Delay \nFirst, the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants11 have failed to discharge their statutory \nduty to adjudicate their DV-2025 applications within a reasonable time. Mot. for PI at 15. That \nfailure, the Plaintiffs contend, compels APA relief under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) and mandamus under \n28 U.S.C. § 1361. Mot. for PI at 16, 20. “The standards for reviewing agency inaction—including \nvisa processing delays—are the same under the APA and Mandamus Act, so the Court will address \nboth claims together.” Doroodchi v. Rubio, No. 24-cv-3170, 2025 WL 1865114, at *2 (D.D.C. \nJuly 7, 2025) (cleaned up) (quoting Akrayi v. U.S. Dep’t of State, No. 22-cv-1289, 2023 WL \n2424600, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 9, 2023)). At the threshold of such claims, the “Plaintiffs must first \n \n11 Because “the President is not an agency within the meaning of the [APA],” the Court excludes \nthe President when it uses the term “Defendants” for the purpose of discussing the Plaintiffs’ APA \nclaims. See Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796 (1992). \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 21 of 40\nallege that the agency ‘failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.’” Da Costa \nv. Immigr. Investor Program Off., 80 F.4th 330, 340 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Norton v. S. Utah \nWilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004)). If the Plaintiffs make it past that threshold, then the Court \nmust analyze “the six factors identified in Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC \n(TRAC), 750 F.2d 70, 79–80 (D.C. Cir. 1984),” to determine whether the Plaintiffs are likely to \nprevail on their 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) and mandamus claims. Rai, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 196. The Court \nfirst (i) discusses whether the Plaintiffs have shown the threshold nondiscretionary duty, and then \n(ii) analyzes the TRAC factors. \ni.  Nondiscretionary Duty \nThe Plaintiffs principally locate a nondiscretionary duty in 8 U.S.C. § 1202(b), which \nstates: “All immigrant visa applications shall be reviewed and adjudicated by a consular officer.” \nMot. for PI at 17, 20. The Plaintiffs cite cases relying on Section 1202(b) to conclude that consular \nofficers have a nondiscretionary duty to “review and adjudicate immigrant visa applications.” E.g., \nFilazapovich v. Dep’t of State, 560 F. Supp. 3d 203, 235 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2021) (quoting Gomez \nv. Biden (Gomez III), No. 20-cv-1419, 2021 WL 3663535, at *14 (D.D.C. Aug. 17, 2021)), rev’d \non other grounds, Goodluck, 104 F.4th 920; Mot. for PI at 20. And the Plaintiffs further rely on \n5 U.S.C. § 555(b), which provides that agencies shall “proceed to conclude a matter presented to \nit” “within a reasonable time.” Mot. for PI at 19. \nThe Court agrees that 8 U.S.C. § 1202(b) confers on consular officers a nondiscretionary \nduty to review and adjudicate immigrant visa applications. The D.C. Circuit’s opinion in Meina \nXie v. Kerry is instructive on this point. 780 F.3d 405 (D.C. Cir. 2015). In Meina Xie, a noncitizen \napplied for a so-called category EB–3 visa. Id. at 406. Her visa application had been pending for \nover eight years, which she said was attributable to the Department of State’s policy of processing \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 22 of 40\nher subcategory of visa less quickly than others. Id. at 407. She challenged that policy as contrary \nto 8 U.S.C. § 1153(e)(1), which states: “Immigrant visas made available under subsection (a) or \n(b) of this section shall be issued to eligible immigrants in the order in which a petition in behalf \nof each such immigrant is filed with the Attorney General.” Id. at 405–06. The D.C. Circuit held \nthat Section 1153(e)(1) sufficiently embodied a nondiscretionary duty to support a 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(1) claim. See id. at 408; see also Da Costa, 80 F.4th at 340 (acknowledging that holding). \nThat was because the noncitizen could point “to a precise section of the INA, establishing a specific \nprinciple of temporal priority that clearly reins in the agency’s discretion, and [she] argues that the \ndisparate cut-off dates for various subcategories manifest a violation of the principle.” Meina Xie, \n780 F.3d at 408. \nSection 1202(b) creates a similar nondiscretionary duty. Section 1202(b) directs: “All \nimmigrant visa applications shall be reviewed and adjudicated by a consular officer.” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1202(b) (emphases added). That is a “precise section of the INA” that establishes a “specific \nprinciple” of comprehensive review and adjudication by consular officers.12 See Meina Xie, 780 \nF.3d  at  408.  And  the  Plaintiffs  here  argue  that  the  Defendants’  failure  to  adjudicate  their \napplications “manifest a violation of the principle.” Id. For that reason, several of the courts in this \nDistrict to have considered the question have held that failure-to-adjudicate-visa claims meet the \nnondiscretionary-duty threshold of 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). See, e.g., Rai, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 195; \nFilazapovich, 560 F. Supp. 3d at 235; Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 198 n.23. \n \n12 22 C.F.R. § 40.1(l) explains that immigrant visa applications are made at the time of the \ninterview with a consular officer, so the duty to adjudicate only arises at that point. The Court does \nnot understand 8 U.S.C. § 1202(b) to require adjudication of all submissions that do not culminate \nin an application at an interview. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 23 of 40\nThe  Defendants,  arguing  that  they  lack  a  duty  to  adjudicate  any  of  the  Plaintiffs’ \napplications, rely again on the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Karimova. Defs.’ Opp’n at 31–32. Given \nthe Court’s extensive discussion of Karimova above, suffice it to say that the Court disagrees with \nthe Defendants that “Karimova is dispositive of the claims presented in this case.” Defs.’ Opp’n \nat 34. Still, two final points on Karimova are worth discussing. First, the Karimova court itself \nrecognized that its analysis hinged on the applicant there invoking only 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), a \nprovision that the court described as merely expressing “general, good-governance principles.” \n2024 WL 3517852, at *3–*4. Accordingly, the Karimova court did not address the “special \nprovision of the immigration code” invoked in Meina Xie and Da Costa, nor did it consider \nwhether any provision other than Section 555(b) created a nondiscretionary duty that could support \na Section 706(1) claim. Id. at *6. Second, the Karimova court framed the relevant question as \nwhether consular officers had a duty, after refusing an application for administrative processing, \nto terminate that processing. See id. at *4. The court reasoned that Section 555(b) “at most could \nhave entitled [the applicant] to the official refusal decision she already received.” Id. But, as \ndiscussed above, this conflates the administrative-processing refusal with a yes-or-no adjudication \nof the application. Here, the Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that only the latter satisfies \nSection 1202(b) and that the Defendants have not yet discharged that nondiscretionary duty. \nii.  The TRAC Factors \nHaving  concluded  that  the  Plaintiffs  are  likely  to  show  that  the  Defendants  had  a \nnondiscretionary duty to adjudicate their visa applications, the Court turns next to the TRAC \nfactors. As mentioned, these factors govern claims under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). Rai, 567 F. Supp. 3d \nat 196. The factors are: \n(1) The time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a rule of reason; \n(2) where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 24 of 40\nwhich it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute, that statutory scheme \nmay supply content for this rule of reason; (3) delays that might be reasonable in \nthe sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human health and welfare \nare at stake; (4) the court should consider the effect of expediting delayed action on \nagency activities or a higher or competing priority; (5) the court should also take \ninto account the nature and extent of the interests prejudiced by delay; and (6) the \ncourt need not find any impropriety lurking behind agency lassitude in order to hold \nthat agency action is “unreasonably delayed.” \nIn re People’s Mojahedin Org. of Iran, 680 F.3d 832, 836–37 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (per curiam) \n(quoting In re United Mine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 F.3d 545, 549 (D.C. Cir. 1999)). \nAlthough “TRAC set forth this framework to assess whether agency delays are ‘so egregious as to \nwarrant mandamus’ under the All Writs Act,” the D.C. Circuit has “routinely applied the same \nframework to assess claims that agency action has been ‘unreasonably delayed’ for purposes of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act.” Afghan & Iraqi Allies v. Blinken, 103 F.4th 807, 815 (D.C. \nCir. 2024) (first quoting TRAC, 750 F.2d at 75, 79–80; and then quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(1)). \nApplying these factors, the Court agrees with the Plaintiffs that they are likely to prevail on their \nunreasonable delay claim. \nFactors one and two: “The first two TRAC factors focus on the extent of and reasons for \nthe agency delay.” Afghan & Iraqi Allies, 103 F.4th at 816. The first factor, which is “the most \nimportant consideration under TRAC,” is that “the time agencies take to make decisions must be \ngoverned by a rule of reason.” Id. (quotation marks omitted) (first quoting In re Core Commc’ns, \nInc., 531 F.3d 849, 855 (D.C. Cir. 2008); and then quoting TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80). The second \nfactor “gives content to the first”: “where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of \nthe speed with which it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute, that statutory scheme \nmay supply content for this rule of reason.” Id. (first quoting United Mine Workers, 190 F.3d at \n549; and then quoting TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80). \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 25 of 40\nThese factors weigh in the Plaintiffs’ favor. As courts in this District have explained, “[t]he \nINA provides a clear indication of the speed with which it expects the agency to proceed in \nprocessing diversity lottery selectees[’] visa applications.” Rai, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 196 (quotation \nmarks omitted) (quoting Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 196). Under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(I)(ii)(II), \ndiversity-visa selectees are eligible to receive their visa “only through the end of the specific fiscal \nyear for which they were selected.” The rigidity of this deadline, as well as its “specificity and \nrelative brevity,” reflects “Congress’s intent that the State Department undertake good-faith efforts \nto ensure that diversity visas are processed and issued before the deadline.” Gomez I, 485 \nF. Supp. 3d at 196 (quoting People’s Mojahedin Org. of Iran, 680 F.3d at 837). \nThe Defendants observe that the delays suffered by the Plaintiffs have been (by visa-\napplication standards) short—the shortest being a couple months and none being more than a year. \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 36. This Court has previously acknowledged that “[c]ourts in this District label \ndelays ‘between three to five years’ as reasonable and generally extend the ‘unreasonable’ label to \ndelays more than five years.” Motevali, 2025 WL 885116, at *7 (quoting Ahmed v. Blinken, 759 \nF. Supp. 3d 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2024)). But this case is unlike those cases. Because of the strict deadline \nCongress imposed on issuance of diversity visas, “when midnight strikes at the end of the fiscal \nyear, those applicants without visas are out of luck.” Goodluck, 104 F.4th at 925 (quoting Yung-\nKai Lu v. Tillerson, 292 F. Supp. 3d 276, 282 (D.D.C. 2018)). This Court joins other courts in this \nDistrict that have concluded the first two TRAC factors favor diversity-visa applicants whose \napplications are stuck in administrative processing when the statutory deadline is impending. See, \ne.g., Rai, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 196–97; Filazapovich, 560 F. Supp. 3d at 236–37; Gomez I, 485 \nF. Supp. 3d at 196. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 26 of 40\nFactors three and five: These factors “focus on the interests affected by agency delay.” \nAfghan & Iraqi Allies, 103 F.4th at 817. The third factor observes that “delays that might be \nreasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human health and welfare \nare at stake.” Id. at 818 (quoting TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80). And the fifth factor addresses “the nature \nand extent of the interests prejudiced by the delay.” Id. (quoting TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80). \nThese  factors  doubtlessly  favor  the  Plaintiffs.  “The  prejudice  from  delay  is  dire—\nDV-20[25] applicants might permanently lose their opportunity to immigrate to the United States” \nand escape what many of the Plaintiffs have described as difficult or dangerous circumstances. \nGomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 196; e.g., Decl. of Abdiqadir Omar Barre ¶ 15 (expressing safety fears \ndue to Somalia’s “unstable” security situation); Decl. of Mohammadsadeg Sadaghian ¶¶ 11–12 \n(describing a lack of access to water and electricity and the fear of compulsory military service); \nDecl. of Seyed Hossein Hadaeghi at ¶ 16 (stating that he “fear[s] for [his] safety constantly” in \nIran); Decl. of Seyed Sina Mousavi ¶ 13 (describing the “oppressive” political environment in \nIran). The Defendants contend that these factors favor them because granting relief to the Plaintiffs \nwould  “simply  benefit  Plaintiffs  to  the  detriment  of  other”  applicants  who  are  awaiting \nadjudication. Defs.’ Opp’n at 39. But this argument is “better suited to the fourth factor, and indeed \n[is] essentially a reprise of Defendants’ argument[] on that factor.” Filazapovich, 560 F. Supp. 3d \nat 237. \nFactor four: The fourth factor “addresses ‘the effect of expediting delayed action on agency \nactivities of a higher or competing priority.’” Afghan & Iraqi Allies, 103 F.4th at 819–20 (quoting \nTRAC, 750 F.2d at 80). This factor is important, as the D.C. Circuit has “refused to grant relief, \neven though all the other factors considered in TRAC favored it, where a judicial order putting the \npetitioner at the head of the queue would simply move all others back one space and produce no \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 27 of 40\nnet gain.” Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council, Inc. v. Norton, 336 F.3d 1094, 1100 (D.C. Cir. \n2003) (cleaned up). The Defendants contend that this is such a case because granting relief would \n“prioritize Plaintiffs’ visa applications ahead of others.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 38. \nBut at this stage, the Defendants’ contention is little more than an unsupported assertion. \nFor this to be a situation of net-zero gain, it would have to be the case that for every Plaintiff’s \napplication  the  Department  of  State  adjudicates,  another  DV-2025  application  would  go \nunadjudicated by the September 30 deadline. Nothing in the record currently before the Court \nindicates that is the reality. But of course, this is a question of fact, and the Court is limited to the \nthin record before it in this preliminary posture. If the Defendants adduce evidence that supports \nthat this is a zero-sum situation, the Court will take that evidence into account as this case \nprogresses. But for now, the Court determines that the fourth factor is neutral. \nSixth factor: The final TRAC factor “notes that ‘the court need not find any impropriety \nlurking behind agency lassitude in order to hold that agency action is unreasonably delayed.’” \nAfghan & Iraqi Allies, 103 F.4th at 820 (quoting TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80). The Plaintiffs contend \nthat there is such impropriety, suggesting the Department of State purposely delayed adjudicating \nthe Plaintiffs’ applications until Proclamation 10949 came into effect. Mot. for PI at 26–27. The \nCourt disagrees. There is nothing currently in the record that supports the Plaintiffs’ supposition. \nBut in any case, “[t]he court ‘need not’ make any such finding to find unreasonable delay . . . and \nso it declines to do so here.” Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 197 (quoting TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80). \nBalancing the TRAC factors: Given the impending drop-dead date for the DV-2025 visas \nand the very high stakes for the Plaintiffs, the TRAC factors tip in their favor. And because the \nCourt has not seen evidence supporting the Defendants’ contention that adjudicating the Plaintiffs’ \napplications will result in the inability to adjudicate other applications prior to the September 30 \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 28 of 40\ndeadline, the fourth factor does not usurp the others. Accordingly, weighing all the TRAC factors \ntogether, the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(1) claims.13 \nb.  Proclamation 10949 and the Department of State’s Guidance \nNext, the Plaintiffs attack Proclamation 10949 as unconstitutional, and the Department of \nState’s implementing guidance as unlawful under the APA. See Mot. for PI at 28–37; Compl. \n¶¶ 512-23. The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their APA claims.14 \nAfter the President promulgated Proclamation 10949, the Department of State issued \nguidance directing consular officers to refuse visa applications from applicants subject to the \nProclamation. See AR CIV010–CIV014. The basis for that directive, the guidance said, was \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). Id. That provision states: \n \n13 Because “relief under the Mandamus Act is only warranted when ‘there is no other adequate \nremedy available to the plaintiff,’” the Court concludes that, having shown a likelihood of success \non their 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) claim, the Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their  claim for \nmandamus. See Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 198 (quoting In re Medicare Reimbursement Litig., \n414 F.3d 7, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2005)). \n14 The Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their constitutional claims. They contend that \nProclamation 10949 is unconstitutional because 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) is itself unconstitutional under \nthe non-delegation doctrine and the separation of powers. Mot. for PI at 28–31. But those \narguments are borderline frivolous in light of Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667 (2018). There, the \nSupreme Court described the “textual limits” that Subsection 1182(f) places on the President, id. \nat 687–88, and those limits are sufficient to survive the “intelligible principle” test the Court has \nprescribed to assess delegations, see Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 186–87. And the separation of \npowers doctrine is an awkward fit for the Plaintiffs’ claims for the simple reason that the President \nissued Proclamation 10949 pursuant to an act of Congress. See Freytag v. Comm’r, 501 U.S. 868, \n878 (1991) (“Our separation-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of one \nbranch’s aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.”); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube \nCo. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (“When the President acts \npursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum[.]”). \nWhen pressed at oral argument, the Plaintiffs urged the Court to disregard Trump v. Hawaii \nbecause it was wrongly decided. Motions Hr’g (Aug. 15, 2025), Rough Tr. at 19:8–16. For obvious \nreasons, the Court will not ignore binding Supreme Court precedent. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 29 of 40\nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into \nthe United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may \nby proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry \nof all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on \nthe entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). The Plaintiffs contend, however, that Subsection 1182(f) does not empower \nconsular officers “to deny the responsibility delegated to them by Congress to review, adjudicate, \nand issue diversity visas.” Mot. for PI at 37; Compl. ¶¶ 519–22 (similar). Thus, the Plaintiffs argue \nthat the Court must recognize the unlawfulness of the Department of State’s guidance under a bevy \nof different APA theories—as arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with law, and in excess \nof statutory authority. See Mot. for PI at 37; Compl. ¶¶ 523, 530, 544. The APA directs courts \nreviewing  agency  action  to  “hold  unlawful  and  set  aside”  actions  found  to  be  “arbitrary, \ncapricious . . . or otherwise not in accordance with law” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority.” \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nHere again, the Court does not write on a blank slate. Several other courts in this District \nhave held that the Department of State cannot rely on proclamations issued pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(f) to deny visa applications. See, e.g., Rai, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 194; Filazapovich, 560 \nF. Supp. 3d at 233–35; Milligan, 502 F. Supp. 3d at 314–16; Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 191–94. \nToday, this Court joins that chorus. \nThe Court starts with the “basic distinction between admissibility determinations and visa \nissuance that runs throughout the INA.” Trump, 585 U.S. at 694. “The Act is rife with examples \ndistinguishing between the two concepts.” Id. at 694 n.3 (listing examples). Not every visa holder \nmay enter the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1201(h) (providing that any noncitizens “to whom a \nvisa . . . has been issued” may not “be admitted” into the United States if “he is found to be \ninadmissible”). And vice versa, not every inadmissible individual is necessarily ineligible for a \nvisa. See, e.g., id. § 1182(k) (providing the Attorney General with discretion to waive certain \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 30 of 40\ninadmissibility conditions for individuals “in possession of an immigrant visa”). In other words, \nthe INA does not “interchangeably” use “[t]he concepts of entry and admission” on the one hand \nand “issuance of a visa” on the other. Trump, 585 U.S. at 695 n.4. \nThat background informs the Court’s reading of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), the statutory authority \non which the President relied in issuing Proclamation 10949. That provision authorizes the \nPresident, subject to specified limitations, to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens \nas immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to \nbe appropriate.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). Plain as day, Subsection 1182(f) addresses only the question \nof entry, not the issuance of visas. No doubt that is why Proclamation 10949 itself only speaks to \nadmissibility. The Proclamation declares that the President “determined to fully [or partially] \nrestrict and limit the entry of nationals” of specified countries. 90 Fed. Reg. at 24499 (emphasis \nadded). \nDespite the clarity of this language, the Defendants take the position that “[t]he INA \nrequires consular officers to refuse visas to aliens subject to an entry suspension under § 1182(f).” \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 18 (emphasis added). Their support for that proposition is 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g), \nwhich states that “[n]o visa . . . shall be issued to an alien if . . . it  appears to the  consular \nofficer . . . that such alien is ineligible to receive a visa . . . under section 1182 of this title, or any \nother provision of law.” The Defendants reason that because Subsection 1182(f) is “part of \nsection 1182,” Section 1201(g) “prevents consular officers from issuing visas to aliens subject to \na Proclamation suspending entry under § 1182(f).” Defs.’ Opp’n at 18–19. \nThat exact argument has already been persuasively rejected by multiple courts in this \nDistrict. As Judge Amit Mehta explained, “Subsection 1201(g) precludes the issuance of visas \nonly as to persons who are ‘ineligible to receive a visa’ under Section 1182, not to persons who \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 31 of 40\nare only ineligible to enter under that provision.” Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 191 (quoting \n8 U.S.C. § 1201(g)). \nThe categories of persons deemed ineligible to receive a visa pursuant to § 1201(g) \nappear in § 1182(a), not § 1182(f). Subsection 1182(a) provides that “aliens who \nare inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and \nineligible to be admitted to the United States.” Thus, a person who falls into one of \nthe categories of inadmissible persons outlined in § 1182(a) is both ineligible to \nenter the country and ineligible to receive a visa pursuant to § 1201(g). \nId. at 191–92 (citation omitted). And Judge Mehta further explained that “[t]he reference to ‘the \nfollowing paragraphs’ in § 1182(a) does not include § 1182(f).” Id. at 192 (cleaned up). That is \nbecause “Section 1182 of the INA carefully distinguishes between subsections, which include \n§§ 1182(a) and 1182(f), and paragraphs, which are subunits of those subsections. Thus, ‘the \nfollowing paragraphs’ in § 1182(a) include only the ten paragraphs of § 1182(a); they do not also \ninclude § 1182(f), a distinct subsection of § 1182.” Id. Judge Mehta concluded that “[a] suspension \nof entry under § 1182(f) therefore has no bearing on whether the person is ‘inadmissible’ under \n§ 1182(a) or ineligible to receive a visa under § 1201(g).” Id. “The Court finds Judge Mehta’s \ninterpretation persuasive and adopts it here.” See Milligan, 502 F. Supp. 3d at 315 (Boasberg, J.) \n(also adopting this analysis). \nPerhaps recognizing the strength of this reasoning, the Defendants do not dispute it—or \neven acknowledge it—in their brief. See Defs.’ Opp’n at 18–21. Instead, the only other point they \nmake that even approaches a textual argument is the unelaborated assertion that the concepts of \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 32 of 40\n“entry and issuance of visas” are “intertwined throughout the INA.”15 Id. at 18. They cite the \nSupreme Court’s description of Section 1182 in Trump v. Hawaii, where the Court said: “any alien \nwho is inadmissible under § 1182 (based on, for example, health risks, criminal history, or foreign \npolicy consequences) is screened out as ‘ineligible to receive a visa.’”16 Trump, 585 U.S. at 695 \n(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g)); Defs.’ Opp’n at 19. But notably, all the examples the Court listed \nare in Subsection 1182(a), which expressly provides that its categories for inadmissibility also \nrender  noncitizens  ineligible  to  receive  a  visa.  See  8  U.S.C.  § 1182(a)(1)  (“Health-related \n \n15 Although 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g) is the only statutory provision the Defendants rely on in their brief, \nsee Defs.’ Opp’n at 18–21, at oral argument the Defendants also alluded to a portion of the 1994 \nForeign Relations Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 103–236, § 140(c), 108 Stat. 382, 399–400 \n(1994), as amended, Pub. L. No. 103–415, § 1(d), 108 Stat. 4299, 4299 (1994) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182 note), Motions Hr’g (Aug. 15, 2025), Rough Tr. at 49:1–9. The relevant provision states \nthat “whenever a United States consular officer issues a visa for admission to the United States, \nthat official shall certify, in writing, that a check of the Automated Visa Lookout System, or any \nother system or list which maintains information about the excludability of aliens under this \nchapter, has been made and that there is no basis under such system for the exclusion of such \nalien.” § 140(c)(1)(A), 108 Stat. at 400. Without anything in the record before the Court about \nwhat information is contained in the Automated Visa Lookout System—or indeed, more saliently, \nwhat Congress understood was included in that System—the Court concludes that this provision \ndoes not undercut the Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits. See Gomez v. Biden (Gomez \nIII), No. 20-cv-1419, 2021 WL 3663535, at *14 (D.D.C. Aug. 17, 2021) (similarly declining to \nrely on this provision in the absence of (1) record evidence “that any Plaintiff’s name was entered \ninto” the System and (2) information about “what consequences follow from a consular officer’s \nissuance of a visa to an individual listed in the system”), rev’d on other grounds, Goodluck, 104 \nF.4th 920. \n16 Similarly, the Defendants also cite a sentence from the background section in Kerry v. Din, 576 \nU.S. 86 (2015). There, the Court stated: “Before issuing a visa, a consular officer must ensure the \nalien is not inadmissible under any provision of the INA.” Id. at 89. But the provision cited by the \nCourt as support for that proposition, 8 U.S.C. § 1361, states only that when a person “makes \napplication for a visa . . . or makes application for admission . . . , the burden of proof shall be on \nsuch person to establish that he is eligible to receive such visa . . . or is not inadmissible under any \nprovision of this chapter.” 8 U.S.C. § 1361  (emphases added). Section 1361 stands for the \nunremarkable proposition that applicants for visas must show their eligibility for a visa, and \napplicants for admission must show their admissibility. This Court understands the Kerry Court to \nhave been relying on the fact that most grounds of inadmissibility also render a noncitizen \nineligible to get a visa. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a). \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 33 of 40\ngrounds”), (a)(2) (“Criminal and related grounds”), (a)(3)(C) (“Foreign policy”). Regardless, the \nCourt’s statement is far too thin a reed to support the idea that inadmissibility and visa eligibility \nare so intertwined that they are occasionally interchangeable—especially given that literally two \nsentences before the one the Defendants invoke, the Court explained that there is a “basic \ndistinction” between admissibility and visa eligibility “throughout the INA.” Trump, 585 U.S. at \n694; id. at 695 n.4. (explaining that the INA does not “interchangeably” use “[t]he concepts of \nentry and admission” and “issuance of a visa”). The Court disagrees with the Defendants that \nstatutory references to prohibitions on entry may sometimes be transmuted into visa ineligibility. \nTurning away from the text of any statute, the Defendants ask the Court to defer to the \nDepartment of State’s “longstanding practice” of refusing visas to noncitizens “who are barred \nfrom entering the United States by a presidential action under § 1182(f).” Defs.’ Opp’n at 19. And \nif it were true, as the Defendants assert, that the Department’s understanding of Subsection 1182(f) \n“has been recognized and repeatedly endorsed by Congress over a period of many years and \nmultiple enactments,” the Court would be all ears. Id. But the Defendants saying it does not make \nit so—it just highlights the lacuna in the Defendants’ brief where one might expect to find citations. \nThus, “[g]iven the clarity of [Sub]section 1182(f) . . . , this Court finds no basis to defer to [the \nDepartment of State]’s practice, however well established it may be.” Milligan, 502 F. Supp. 3d \nat 315; see Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 394 (2024). \nFinally, the Defendants argue that the Court’s reading of Subsection 1182(f) “would \nproduce absurd practical consequences.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 20. It would be absurd, the Defendants \nclaim, to permit consular officers to issue visas despite the applicant being unable to enter the \nUnited States. Id. at 21. The Defendants further raise the specter of “the unintended entry of \ninadmissible aliens, or at the very least confusion and administrative burdens.” Id. Although the \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 34 of 40\nCourt is sensitive to these concerns, they are, at bottom, policy concerns. And “‘even the most \nformidable’ policy arguments cannot ‘overcome’” clear statutory text. B.P. P.L.C. v. Mayor and \nCity Council of Balt., 593 U.S. 230, 245 (2021) (quoting Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 56 n.4 \n(2012)). More generally, “[i]t is not [the Court’s] place to question whether Congress adopted the \nwisest or most workable policy, only to discern and apply the policy it did adopt.” Ysleta Del Sur \nPueblo v. Texas, 596 U.S. 685, 706 (2022). If the Defendants think “good governance requires a \ndifferent set of rules, its appeals are better directed to those who make the laws than those charged \nwith following them.” Id. \nThe Court, therefore, is left reviewing Department of State guidance documents that claim \nthat visa denials are mandatory under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) despite that statute appearing to say no \nsuch thing. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that the Department of \nState’s  Subsection 1182(f)  guidance  is  “not  in  accordance  with  law”  and  “in  excess  of \nstatutory . . . authority.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n*          *          * \nTaking a step back, the Court concludes that some of the Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood \nof success on the merits while others have not. The Denied Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate \nthat they will likely overcome the doctrine of consular non-reviewability. But the Administrative-\nProcessing Plaintiffs have established that they are likely to prevail on their claims (1) that the \nDefendants have unreasonably delayed adjudicating their applications, and (2) that the Department \nof State’s guidance relating to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) is unlawful. The Court next turns to the other \npreliminary injunction factors. \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 35 of 40\nB.  Irreparable Harm \nIn addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits, a party seeking a preliminary \ninjunction must show that, without relief, it will suffer irreparable harm. The injury “must be both \ncertain and great, actual and not theoretical, beyond remediation, and of such imminence that there \nis a clear and present need for equitable relief.” Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d \n544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (cleaned up). \nThis Court “has little trouble concluding that the . . . Plaintiffs have established irreparable \nharm.” Filazapovich, 560 F. Supp. 3d at 244. The Plaintiffs “have provided a mountain of \naffidavits attesting to the severe emotional, economic, educational, and personal harms that they \nand their families will imminently experience if Defendants’ actions are not enjoined [before] \nSeptember 30, 202[5], and they permanently lose their opportunity to immigrate to the United \nStates through the diversity visa program.” Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 200; see, e.g., Decl. of \nMaysam Mahboubmojaz at ¶ 10 (describing the applicant’s separation from his wife); Decl. of \nMehdi Sojoudi Kelishami at ¶ 8–12 (describing the applicant giving up his job, closing his \nbusiness, and being separated from his wife and daughter); Decl. of Koffi Fabrice Djondo at \n¶¶ 19–24 (describing impact on the applicant’s educational opportunities). Indeed, several courts \n \nin this District have found that situations nearly identical to this one present irreparable harm. See, \ne.g., Rai, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 201; Filazapovich, 560 F. Supp. 3d at 244; Milligan, 502 F. Supp. 3d \nat 320; Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 200. \nThe Defendants think there is no point in adjudicating the Plaintiffs’ applications if the \nPlaintiffs cannot immigrate to the United States. See Defs.’ Opp’n at 42. They say that the status \nquo would not harm the Plaintiffs, even when the Plaintiffs’ diversity-visa opportunity expires on \nSeptember 30. See id. And they emphasize that even if the Plaintiffs have their visa applications \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 36 of 40\napproved, a “visa is not a right to admission” and they will remain inadmissible pursuant to \nProclamation 10949. See id. at 42–43. Shockingly, the Defendants also suggest that the Plaintiffs’ \nharm is not irreparable because they could “apply next year” and “win the lottery” again. Id. at 42. \nBut the Defendants miss the gravity of what the Plaintiffs stand to lose. The Plaintiffs \nliterally won the lottery; they were randomly selected from millions of people around the world \nhoping for one of a handful of visas that could give them a chance to immigrate to the United \nStates. See Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 159. It may well be that, because of circumstances outside \nof their control, they will ultimately be unable to enter the United States even if they get a visa. \nBut all the Plaintiffs are asking for is an answer on their applications, and one that is given lawfully. \nIt would be callous indeed to dismiss the irreparable harm these Plaintiffs would suffer if the \nDepartment of State lets their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity expire. \nC.  Balance of Equities and Public Interest \n“The last factors, which the Court considers together, examine ‘the balance of equities’ and \n‘the public interest,’” and these factors merge when the non-moving party is the Government. \nMilligan, 502 F. Supp. 3d at 321 (quoting Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). \nThese factors also favor relief. “If the court does not grant preliminary relief now, there is a strong \nlikelihood that these Plaintiffs will lose any opportunity for permanent relief later. These drastic \nharms heavily favor preliminary relief.” Gomez I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 200. “[A]nd even for those \nPlaintiffs whose visas are ultimately denied, knowledge of the decision will allow them to more \nconcretely plan their futures.” Milligan, 502 F. Supp. 3d at 321. Further “there is a substantial \npublic interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their \nexistence and operations.’” League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. \n2016) (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)). \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 37 of 40\nThe Defendants complain about the administrative difficulty for the Government “to issue \nvisas to some individuals but then have to determine that they cannot enter the United States at a \nport of entry.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 43–44. “But this alleged problem is neither new to immigration \nofficers  nor  unique  to  this  Court’s  understanding  of  [Sub]section 1182(f).”  Milligan,  502 \nF. Supp. 3d at 320 at 321. No visa guarantees admission, they only give an individual “permission \nto arrive at a port of entry and have an immigration officer independently examine the alien’s \neligibility for admission.” Goodluck, 104 F.4th at 922 (quoting Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 \nF.3d 1153, 1157 (D.C. Cir. 1999)). The Government suffers little harm in continuing to trust its \nimmigration officers with independently examining the admissibility of all potential entrants, visa \nholders or otherwise. \nThe Defendants further suggest that it would not serve the public interest to push the \nPlaintiffs to the front of the adjudicatory queue at a cost to other DV-2025 applicants. Defs.’ Opp’n \nat 43–44. But as the Court discussed above, the Defendants have offered nothing other than mere \nassertions to support the contention that granting relief to these Plaintiffs will mean that other \napplicants will not have their applications adjudicated. And finally, the Defendants argue that \ngranting the Plaintiffs relief “would interfere in the Executive Branch’s foreign affairs and national \nsecurity activities.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 44. These are interests that the Court takes seriously. Yet, the \nonly relief the Court will grant in this case is to require the Department of State to adjudicate the \nPlaintiffs’ applications subject to the same standards—with the exception of Subsection 1182(f)—\nit uses in every other case. Balancing these interests together, the Court concludes that they support \na preliminary injunction. \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 38 of 40\nREMEDY \nUnder the APA, a court “may issue all necessary and appropriate process to . . . preserve \nstatus or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. This includes “the \npower to compel agency inaction when necessary ‘to preserve status or rights.’” Gomez I, 485 \nF. Supp. 3d at 203. And more generally, “[a]n injunction ‘is an exercise of discretion and judgment, \noften dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it \npresents.’” Rai, 567 F. Supp. 3d at 202 (quoting Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 \nU.S. 571, 579 (2017)). It must also “be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm shown.” \nNeb. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs. v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 435 F.3d 326, 330 (D.C. \nCir. 2006) (quoting Aviation Consumer Action Project v. Washburn, 535 F.2d 101, 108 (D.C. Cir. \n1976)). Still, “[t]he equitable tradition has long embraced the rule that courts generally ‘may \nadminister complete relief between the parties.’” Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2557 \n(2025) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Kinney-Coastal Oil Co. v. Kieffer, 277 U.S. 488, 507 (1928)). \nHere, the harms for which the Plaintiffs have met their preliminary-injunction burdens are \n(1) the  Administrative-Processing  Plaintiffs’  applications  remaining  unadjudicated  pending \nadministrative processing, and (2) the application of the Department of State’s likely unlawful \nguidance concerning the effect of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) proclamations on visa applications. The relief \nthe Court orders is twofold: First, the Secretary of State shall undertake good-faith efforts, directly \nand through his designees, to expeditiously process and adjudicate the Plaintiffs’ applications that \nare currently in administrative processing by September 30, 2025. Second, in processing and \nadjudicating the relevant Plaintiffs’ applications, the Secretary of State, directly and through his \ndesignees, is preliminarily enjoined from issuing visa-application refusals based on 8 U.S.C. \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 39 of 40\n§ 1182(f), Proclamation 10949, or any guidance instructing consular officers to refuse visas based \non Subsection 1182(f). \nFinally, the Court pauses to make clear what it is not ordering. The Court denies any relief \nto the Denied Plaintiffs, by which the Court means any of the Plaintiffs whose visa applications \nhave been refused without further administrative processing. Further, “[t]he Court . . . takes no \nposition on whether the Defendants must issue visas to each Plaintiff named in this suit. Nor does \nit  decide  whether  other  provisions  of  the  INA,  not  briefed  in  this  case,  enable  [the  State \nDepartment] to deny visas or suspend their issuances.” Milligan, 502 F. Supp. 3d at 316. The relief \nthe Court grants today is directed only to ensure that the Plaintiffs get adjudications that settle their \napplications as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1202(b), and that those adjudications do not rely on the \nDepartment of State’s likely unlawful interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). \nThe Court further orders the Defendants to file a status report by August 28, 2025, and \nanother every seven days thereafter, that updates the Court on how many of the Plaintiffs’ \napplications have been adjudicated and how many remain to be adjudicated. Finally, the Plaintiffs \nare ordered to post collectively a bond in the amount of $1.00. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c); see Am. \nOversight v. Hegseth, No. 25-cv-883, 2025 WL 1721995, at *12 (D.D.C. June 20, 2025). \n   \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02369-SLS     Document 22     Filed 08/21/25     Page 40 of 40\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 11. \nA separate order will issue. \n \n \n \nSPARKLE L.
