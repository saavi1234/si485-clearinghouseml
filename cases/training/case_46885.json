Represented by Community Advocates for Just and Moral Governance, in addition to private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the City of San Diego and two non-profit organizations&mdash;Dreams for Change and Downtown Partnership&mdash;under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the Fair Housing Act, Title II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and various California state laws. The complaint also listed causes of action based on nuisance and negligence. The unhoused individuals alleged they were coerced to reside in the city&rsquo;s Safe Sleeping Program to avoid harassment from law enforcement, even though the camps were rodent-infested, moldy, lacking in adequate food, shade, and shelter, and in defiance of fire safety standards. They sought injunctive, declarative, and monetary relief, including compensatory and damages, as well as attorney&rsquo;s fees.</p>\r\n<p><br />The case was assigned to Judge Andrew G. Schopler. As of September 17, 2025, the case is ongoing.</p>",

Plaintiffs are eight unhoused people with disabilities who, having no other \n3  options for affordable housing or safe appropriate shelter, and to avoid the constant \n4  threat of harassment, sweeps, and arrest by police, are forced to live in unhabitable, \n5  inhumane, and inaccessible conditions at one of two designated Camps established and \n6  operated  by  the  City  of  San  Diego  (“City”).  These  Camps,  operating  under  the \n7  Orwellian name of the “Safe Sleeping Program,” are anything but safe for its residents. \n8  Instead, the Camps are rodent infested, and lack adequate food, shade and shelter from \n9  the elements, compelling its residents to stay in tents designed for ice-fishing or \n10  otherwise inappropriate for their intended use, often placed two feet apart or less, \n11  constituting a fire hazard, and to endure excessive and dangerous heat in the summer \n12  and fall, and cold and flooding in the winter, leaving tents and personal property often \n13  saturated with mold. \n14  2.  For  Plaintiffs  (and  other  residents  with  disabilities),  these  inaccessible  and \n15  inhumane  conditions  and  Defendants’  failure  and  refusal  to  provide  reasonable \n16  accommodations to meet disability-related needs, make living conditions in the Camps \n17  untenable, seriously threatening and aggravating mental and physical health. Plaintiffs \n18  ask that the Court order the Defendants to remedy these issues, comply with their \n19 \nduties, and properly and fully provide and maintain safe, sanitary, and suitable living \n20 \nconditions in these facilities.  \n21 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22 \n3.  This court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331 because \n23 \nPlaintiffs claims arise under the laws of the United States. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n24 \n1367,  this  Court  has  supplemental  jurisdiction over  the  state  law  claims because \n25 \nPlaintiffs’ state law claims are related to Plaintiffs’ federal law claims, arise out of a \n26 \ncommon nucleus of operative acts and form part of the same case or controversy under \n27 \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution. \n28 \n/// \n \n- 3 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.4     Page 4 of 49\n \n1  4.  Venue is proper in this Judicial District because Plaintiffs’ claims arise from \n2  unlawful conduct occurring in San Diego County, California. \n3 \nPARTIES \n4 \nA. PLAINTIFFS \n5 \n5.  Plaintiff JEFFREY RYAN BRADLEY is a 34-year-old unhoused person with \n6 \ndisabilities that substantially limit major life activities.  He used to run his own business \n7 \nuntil he was forced to stop due to his worsening disabilities. Mr. Bradley’s disabilities \n8 \ninclude COPD, chronic pain in neck, back, face and hands resulting from multiple \n9 \ninjuries and surgeries, and depression and anxiety. Having no alternatives available to \n10 \nhim for affordable housing or safe accessible shelter—and to avoid the constant threat \n11 \nof harassment, sweeps, citations, and arrest by police—he has been living at the “Safe \n12 \nSleeping  Program”  at  the  “O  lot”,  located  at  Park  Blvd.  and  Wieber  Avenue \n13 \n(hereinafter “O lot), since on or about May 30, 2024, and currently resides at the “O \n14 \nlot”. Mr. Bradley’s mental health condition is aggravated by the overcrowded and \n15 \nunsanitary  and  unsafe  conditions,  and  lack  of  privacy  at  the  camp.  His  physical \n16 \ndisabilities are aggravated when he is required to walk up the hill at the camp due to \n17 \nthe shuttle services’ limited hours of operation. Mr. Bradley meets the definition of \n18 \n“chronically homeless”, as defined by the regulations issued by the U.S. Department \n19 \nof Housing and Urban development (“HUD”). 24 C.F.R. §91.5. Mr. Bradley is also a \n20 \nqualified  individual  with  disabilities  within  the  meaning  of  the  Americans  with \n21 \nDisabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  42  U.S.C.  §12102;  the  Fair  Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C. \n22 \n§3602(h); and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”). California \n23 \nGovernment Code §12926.       \n24 \n6.  Plaintiff KAREN ABOOD is a 53-year-old unhoused person with disabilities \n25 \nthat substantially limit major life activities. Her disabilities include PTSD, anxiety \n26 \ndisorder,  depression,  and  chronic  migraine  headaches.  She  is  taking  psychiatric \n27 \nmedication for her disabilities. Ms. Abood lost her housing as a result of a divorce. \n28 \nHaving no reasonable alternatives for affordable housing or safe accessible shelter \n \n- 4 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.5     Page 5 of 49\n \n1  available to her—and to avoid the constant threat of harassment, sweeps, citations, and \n2  arrest by police—she has been living at the “Safe Sleeping Program” at the “O lot” \n3  since on or about May 30, 2024, and currently resides at the “O lot”. Ms. Abood \n4  experiences  aggravation  of  her  mental  health  condition  due  to  the  overcrowded, \n5  unsanitary, and unsafe conditions, and lack of privacy at the camp. Ms. Abood meets \n6  the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by the regulations issued by the \n7  HUD. 24 C.F.R. §91.5.  Ms. Abood is also a qualified individual with disabilities within \n8  the meaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12102; the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3602(h); \n9  and the FEHA. California Government Code §12926.      \n10  7.  Plaintiff TOSHA ALVEREZ is a 36-year-old unhoused person with disabilities \n11  that substantially limit major life activities. Her disabilities include major depression, \n12  ADHD, mania, anxiety disorder and learning disabilities. She also is neurodivergent.  \n13  She has an assistance animal (a cat), that provides her with necessary emotional \n14  support.  Having  no  alternatives  available  to  her  for  affordable  housing  or  safe \n15  accessible shelter, and to avoid the constant threat of harassment, sweeps, citations, and \n16  arrest by police, she has been living at the “Safe Sleeping Program” at the “20th & B \n17  lot” (hereinafter “B lot”) located at 26th Street and Pershing Drive, since on or about \n18 \nOctober of 2023 and currently resides at the lot. She became pregnant during her stay \n19 \nand was temporarily transferred to a hotel by an adoption agency, for sake of the health \n20 \nof her and her unborn child, due to the poor, unsafe living conditions at the “B lot”.  \n21 \nAfter giving birth and giving up her child for adoption, she had no other options but to \n22 \nreturn to the “B lot.” The poor, overcrowded, unsanitary and unsafe conditions at the \n23 \nCamp aggravate her mental health conditions.

Plaintiff  TIMOTHY  ALLEN  is  a  55-year-old  unhoused  individual  with \n2  disabilities  that  substantially  limit  major  life  activities.  His  disabilities  include \n3  depression, anxiety, cellulitis, and a chronic staph infection. Mr. Allen relies on an \n4  emotional support animal (a puppy), to help manage his disabilities. Mr. Allen worked \n5  in a career as a machine operator before becoming homeless after he lost his job and \n6  his unemployment ran out.  Having no alternatives available to him for affordable \n7  housing or safe, accessible shelter—and to avoid the constant threat of harassment, \n8  sweeps, citations, and arrest by police—he has been residing at the “Safe Sleeping \n9  Program” at the “B lot”, since on or about November 15, 2024. Mr. Allen’s mental \n10  health  condition  is  aggravated  by  the  poor,  overcrowded,  unsanitary  and  unsafe \n11  conditions at the Camp. Mr. Allen has been temporarily exited (removed) from the \n12  program without proper advanced notice nor a hearing, shortly following a dispute with \n13  Defendants  regarding  a  request  for  reasonable  accommodation  for  his  emotional \n14  support animal. Mr. Allen is a qualified individual with disabilities within the meaning \n15  of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12102; the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3602(h); and the \n16  FEHA Cal.

His disabilities include chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), \n19 \nanxiety,  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD),  and  unspecified  dissociative  disorder \n20 \n(UDD) which necessitate that he live in a space with adequate privacy. Mr. Burton has \n21 \nbeen diagnosed with anxiety, MDD, CPTSD, and UDD. Mr. Burton has dedicated \n22 \nmany years to helping underserved communities as a peer support specialist, offering \n23 \npeer support, food and resources to unhoused individuals full time, even as he navigates \n24 \nbeing unhoused himself. Since residing at “B Lot,” the alarming lack of adequate \n25 \nsecurity has caused Mr. Burton to become increasingly hypervigilant, significantly \n26 \nworsening his anxiety. Additionally, the lack of personal space has exacerbated his \n27 \nPTSD symptoms. Due to Mr. Burton’s disabilities, the ongoing mistreatment he has \n28 \nwitnessed at “B Lot”—including staff belittlement, threats, and the lack of security—\n \n- 6 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.7     Page 7 of 49\n \n1  has significantly worsened his condition. Since being placed at the lot, his disabilities \n2  have deteriorated, leading to serious medical complications. Having no alternatives \n3  available to him for affordable housing or safe, accessible shelter—and to avoid the \n4  constant threat of harassment, sweeps, citations, and arrest by police—he has been \n5  residing at the “Safe Sleeping Program” at the “B lot” since on or about October 27, \n6  2025.

His  disabilities  include \n11  neuropathy in his left hand, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and ADHD. Mr. \n12  Scallan is a marine veteran and former paralegal. Having no alternatives available to \n13  him for affordable housing or safe, accessible shelter—and to avoid the constant threat \n14  of harassment, sweeps, citations, and arrest by police—he has been residing at the “Safe \n15  Sleeping  Program”  at  the  “B  lot,”  since  on  or  about  August  14,  2024.  Due  to \n16  misinformation given to Mr. Scallan by “211” when he initially was referred to the \n17  camp, he believed that he could register and check into the program by showing up in \n18 \nperson. This information turned out to be incorrect, and Mr. Scallan had to live in the \n19 \nwoods next to the camp for two weeks as he waited to be admitted. During that time, \n20 \nwhile Mr. Scallan was at a day labor job, San Diego’s Environmental Services came to \n21 \nhis tent area, posted a three-hour notice, and threw away all of his belongings, including \n22 \nthe silver urn with his mother’s ashes, his laptops, birth certificate and driver’s license. \n23 \nThis frustrated Mr. Scallan’s efforts to get his life on track and secure long-term \n24 \nhousing.

Plaintiff JOHN BORJA is a 49-year-old unhoused individual with mental \n2  health and physical disabilities, including diabetes and sleep apnea. His doctor has \n3  prescribed use of a CPAP machine, without which he is at risk of serious injury or \n4  death.  He is currently prescribed psychiatric medication and has been found disabled \n5  and unable to work by the Social Security Administration since 2005. Previously, he \n6  has worked as a cashier at a 7-11 store and at a 76-gas station. Having no alternatives \n7  available to him for affordable or safe, accessible housing—and in order to avoid \n8  constant threats of harassment, sweeps, citations, and arrest by law enforcement—Mr. \n9  Borja has been residing at the “Safe Sleeping Program” at the “B lot,”, since on or \n10  about October 22nd, 2024. Mr. Borja has been prevented from using his CPAP machine \n11  at the Camp and has been denied an appropriate diet for his diabetes, placing him at \n12  grave risk of harm. The poor, overcrowded conditions at the camp also aggravate his \n13  mental health disabilities. Mr. Borja is a qualified individual with disabilities under the \n14  ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12101; the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3602(h); and the FEHA, \n15  Cal. Gov’t Code §12926. \n16  12.  Plaintiff  LAURA  ZALETA  is  a  59-year-old  unhoused  individual  with \n17  disabilities that substantially limit major life activities. Her disabilities include spinal \n18 \ncompression, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Ms. Zaleta \n19 \nworked most of her life before her disabilities worsened in the restaurant industry, \n20 \nworking her way up from washing dishes in restaurants to managing restaurants. Ms. \n21 \nZaleta resides in the ADA-designated area of the “B” lot and relies on a walker for \n22 \nmobility.  Having  no  alternatives  available  to  her  for  affordable  housing  or  safe, \n23 \naccessible shelter—and to avoid the constant threat of harassment, sweeps, citations, \n24 \nand arrest by police—she has been residing at the “Safe Sleeping Program” at the “B \n25 \nlot,” since on or about May of 2024. Due to her disability, she requires access to the \n26 \ndesignated  handicap-accessible  showers.  However,  with  only  one  such  shower \n27 \navailable, and it being out of order for an extended period, Ms. Zaleta spent two months \n28 \nunable to bathe—resulting in painful sores developing on her body. She currently \n \n- 8 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.9     Page 9 of 49\n \n1  navigates the uneven pavement of the “B lot” using her walker, but the poor ground \n2  conditions have aggravated her physical condition and have caused two of her walkers \n3  to break since she began living there.  Ms. Zaleta has had difficulty getting in and out \n4  of  the  shuttle  at  the  Camp  with  her  walker.    The  substandard  living  conditions, \n5  overcrowding, and lack of privacy have also aggravated her mental health.

Gov’t Code §12926.  \n9  B. DEFENDANTS \n10  13.  Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO is now, and at all times herein mentioned \n11  in this Complaint, was a local government agency and subdivision of the State of \n12  California. Defendant City of San Diego operates, manages, and controls its “Safe \n13  Sleeping program” in two locations- Lot B and Lot O, through the City’s Homelessness \n14  Strategies  and  Solutions  Department.  City  of  San  Diego  is  responsible  for  the \n15  conditions at these lots, and is further responsible, along with the City’s ADA office, \n16  for the failure and refusal to make timely and adequate reasonable accommodations to \n17  Plaintiffs and to provide accessible program and common areas. Further, Defendant \n18 \nCity of San Diego is responsible for failing to provide a sufficient number of safe, \n19 \nadequate  accessible  indoor  shelters  and  affordable  housing  units,  and  for  the \n20 \nenforcement by its police department of various ordinances used to harass, sweep, cite, \n21 \narrest and/or remove unhoused people and their belongings from City parks and streets, \n22 \neven though they have no options for safe shelter. The CITY is also responsible for \n23 \ncoercing Plaintiffs into accepting a spot in the “Safe Sleeping” program as the only \n24 \nalternative provided them to avoid police harassment, sweeps, citation and arrest. \n25 \nDefendant City of San Diego has entered into contractual relationships with Defendants \n26 \nDreams for Change and Downtown Partnership, delegating portions of the work in \n27 \noperating the two camps- Lot B and Lot O campsites - under the City’s continued \n28 \noverall supervision and control.  \n \n- 9 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.10     Page 10 of\n49\n \n1  14.  Defendant DREAMS FOR CHANGE is and at all times herein mentioned was \n2  a non-profit agency registered in the State of California that has been contracted by the \n3  City to assist in operating the two homeless Camps. It is jointly responsible with the \n4  City for the unsafe and unlivable conditions of the Camps it helps operate and for the \n5  failure and refusal to make timely and adequate reasonable accommodations for the \n6  Plaintiffs and to install and maintain accessible amenities and common areas that are \n7  readily achievable.  \n8  15.  Defendant  DOWNTOWN  PARTNERSHIP  is,  and  at  all  times  herein \n9  mentioned was, a non-profit agency registered in the State of California that has been \n10  contracted by the City to assist in operating Lot O.  It is under contract with the City of \n11  San Diego and jointly responsible with the City and Defendant Dreams for Change for \n12  the unsafe and unlivable conditions of the Camp at Lot O that it helps operate. \n13  16. Defendants and each of them are agents, servants and employees of each other \n14  and in the actions and inactions alleged herein were acting in the course and scope of \n15  their agency, service and employment and, unless otherwise indicated, are jointly liable \n16  for the claims described herein.  \n17 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n18 \nA. The  Affordable  Housing  and  Homelessness  crisis,  and  Corresponding \n19 \nShelter shortage. \n20 \n17.  Plaintiffs are on small, fixed incomes, are unable to work or work full-time due \n21 \nto disabilities, and have therefore been priced out of an increasingly unaffordable local \n22 \nhousing market.   \n23 \n18. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the growing homelessness crisis  \n24 \nin San Diego is directly linked to the lack of affordable housing. As of 2024, the \n25 \naverage cost of a studio apartment is around $2,160 per month, while SSI benefits for \n26 \nan individual with disabilities only pays $1,182.94 per month. Without rental subsidies \n27 \nor the development of more affordable housing, Plaintiffs have no practical way of \n28 \nescaping their homelessness. As of early 2024, nearly 58,000 people were seeking \n \n- 10 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.11     Page 11 of\n49\n \n1  section 8 vouchers in the city of San Diego and no new vouchers had been issued since \n2  2022. (Voice of San Diego, May 3, 2024.) The wait for benefits has been described as \n3  15 years or more.  \n4  19.  The 2024 Point in Time Count conducted by the Regional Taskforce on  \n5  Homelessness (RTFH), counted an unsheltered population of 3,489- a 6.2% increase \n6  since 2023. The total homeless population was counted as 6,783.  These figures consist \n7  of people contacted in one night and are generally understood to be a significant \n8 \nundercount.  Though the counted homeless population fell 6.6% according to the 2025 \n9 \nPoint in Time Count, it is still larger than at any point from 2014 through 2023.  \n10 \n20.  From January through March 2025, the homeless population in San Diego  \n11 \nbegan growing again, with more people becoming homeless than those who had found \n12 \nhousing. \n13 \n21.  As of October 2024, the City funded 1,900 beds in indoor shelters. As of the  \n14 \nend of 2024, San Diego has lost more than 600 of these beds. For the first time, they \n15 \nare being “replaced” by 263 shelter beds and an expansion of the “Safe Sleeping \n16 \nprogram” by 180 tent spaces at Lot O and by 50 tent spaces at Lot B. There are currently \n17 \n767 tents in the “Safe Sleeping Program,” increasing the overcrowding at the sites. That \n18 \nleaves  only  1563  indoor  beds,  for  a  homeless  population  of  over  6,000,  and  an \n19 \nunsheltered population of more than twice the number of beds. \n20 \n22.  The City’s indoor homeless shelters are often inaccessible for people with  \n21 \ndisabilities, aggravating their physical and mental health conditions, due to complete \n22 \nlack of privacy and overcrowding, and risking their health and even lives through the \n23 \neasy spread of disease such as Covid. \n24 \nB. City Ordinances Criminalize Homelessness and Compel Plaintiffs and \n25 \nother Unhoused People into City sanctioned and operated Camps. \n26 \n23.  The City of San Diego has enacted and/or enforced a series of municipal  \n27 \nordinances and state laws that criminalize basic, life-sustaining activities of unhoused \n28 \nindividuals—such  as  sleeping,  sitting,  storing  belongings,  and  camping  in  public \n \n- 11 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.12     Page 12 of\n49\n \n1  spaces. These laws are routinely enforced to exclude unhoused people from public \n2  areas and to coerce them into accepting placement in camps like the “Safe Sleeping \n3  Program.”  The  following  statutes  and  ordinances  illustrate  this  pattern  of \n4  criminalization: \n5  San Diego Municipal Code  \n6  a.  San Diego Municipal Code §54.0105: unlawful for any person to place, \n7  or allow to remain, any goods, wares, baggage, personal property or \n8  merchandise on any sidewalk or curb, between the outer edge of the \n9  sidewalk or curb and the property line.  \n10  b.  San Diego Municipal Code §54.0110 “Encroachment”: It is unlawful for \n11  any person to erect, place, allow to remain, construct, establish, plant, or \n12  maintain any vegetation or object on any public street, alley, sidewalk, \n13  highway,  or  other  public  property  or  public  right-of-way,  except  as \n14  otherwise provided by this Code. \n15  c.  San Diego Municipal Code §63.0404: The ordinance prohibits individuals \n16  from camping or maintaining encampments on public property without \n17  express  authorization  from  the  City  Manager,  regardless  of  shelter \n18 \navailability. It further bans encampments that pose risks to public health \n19 \nor safety, interfere with government operations, or are situated within \n20 \nrestricted  areas,  including  within  two  blocks  of  schools,  shelters, \n21 \nwaterways, hazardous parks, or transit hubs, provided appropriate signage \n22 \nis posted. \n23 \nd.  San Diego Municipal Code §63.0406: provides for removal of personal \n24 \nproperty, camping paraphernalia, and all other property, contraband, litter, \n25 \nand waste found at an encampment or at a location where a person is \n26 \nengaged in unlawful camping.  \n27 \nCalifornia Penal Code  \n28 \n \n- 12 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.13     Page 13 of\n49\n \n1  a.  Cal.  Penal  Code  §647(e):  “criminalizing  “lodg[ing]  in  any  building, \n2  structure,  vehicle,  or  place  whether  public  or  private,  without  the \n3  permission of the owner or person entitled to the possession or in control \n4  of it”  \n5  b.  Cal.  Penal  Code  §148(a):  prohibits  willfully  resisting,  delaying  or \n6  obstructing agency or law enforcement personnel, from issuing citations \n7  when an “individual refused to vacate an encampment” after “notice”. \n8  c.  Cal Penal Code §372:  prohibits “unlawfully obstruct[ing] the free passage \n9  or use, in the customary manner, of any…public park, square, street, or \n10  highway” \n11  d.  Cal.  Penal  Code  §647(c):  criminalizing  “willfully  and  maliciously \n12  obstruct[ing] the free movement of any person on any street, sidewalk, or \n13  other public place or on or in any place open to the public”. \n14  C. Unsafe and inhumane conditions prevail at the “Safe Sleeping Program.” \n15  24.  The “Safe Sleeping Program” is inherently unsafe for the Plaintiffs and others  \n16  that reside at the camps, threatening health and even life. The Program is especially \n17  inaccessible to and uninhabitable for people with disabilities, aggravating their mental \n18 \nand physical health conditions. The camp locations themselves are inappropriate for \n19 \noutdoor living. Lot B is in a flood plain and the O lot is steep, entirely gravel, and \n20 \nbecomes muddy when it rains. Neither Lot has any natural shade. The terrain is \n21 \ninaccessible  and  difficult  and  dangerous  to  navigate  for  people  with  mobility \n22 \nimpairments, including people who use wheelchairs, walkers or canes. Ice tents without \n23 \nfloors that were originally assigned to the residents, and the new tents that replaced \n24 \nthem, are both inappropriate for their intended use in San Diego. The tents have been \n25 \nplaced, in most cases—two feet apart or less—limiting privacy, posing a fire hazard, \n26 \nand making the spread of rodent infestation, other vermin, and disease, far likelier. \n27 \nThough there are limited shade structures placed in the common areas, there is  \n28 \n \n- 13 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.14     Page 14 of\n49\n \n1  no shade for the tents and no way to cool the inside space of the tents during hot \n2  weather, causing residents to risk hyperthermia, nor is there any way to retain any \n3  warmth inside the tents in winter. Individual canopies are forbidden because of the \n4  proximity of the tents to each other, due to fire danger. Tent temperatures can go up to \n5  110 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer and fall. There is no heat available to stay \n6  warm in winter, in or outside the tents, placing Plaintiffs and other residents at risk for \n7  hypothermia. The tents provide little to no protection against rain. The heavy rains in \n8  2024 forced the residents of B Lot to be evacuated, and the residents were left with wet \n9  and moldy tent space and belongings.  \n10  25.  Security is minimal to non-existent at the camps, with no guards on duty during  \n11  much of the time, and non-residents able to get on the premises, some of whom have \n12  threatened residents with physical and/or sexual violence. Upon information and belief, \n13  at least one “guard” working in Lot B wore an ankle monitor and frequently sexually \n14  harassed female residents, requiring “favors” in exchange for food or necessities. The \n15  campsites are located far away from resources, requiring that Plaintiffs and other \n16  residents  access  a  shuttle  to  get  to  Park  Blvd.  so  they  can  walk  or  seek  bus \n17  transportation to obtain medical care or find food.  The shuttle itself is not accessible \n18 \nto all residents, has limited hours, and there are not enough of them to allow for daily \n19 \ntrips outside the camp for everyone. Only two small meals are provided to residents, \n20 \ninsufficient to meet the daily nutritional and caloric needs of the residents, some of \n21 \nwhom may be unable, due to disability or health, to leave the camp for the day to \n22 \nsupplement their diet, resulting in camp residents suffering hunger and malnutrition.  \n23 \nThere is no safe secure place provided to store non-perishable food away from rodents \n24 \nand other animals and no access to refrigeration or cooking facilities. There was at least \n25 \none instance of widespread food poisoning in Lot O, following a communal meal, as \n26 \nwell as multiple reports of residents in both Lot O and Lot B becoming ill after \n27 \nconsuming the provided food. Plaintiffs have all suffered from unsafe and inadequate \n28 \nnutrition while living at the Lots.  \n \n- 14 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.15     Page 15 of\n49\n \n1  26.  Though both Lots B and O have experienced rodent problem, Lot O has suffered  \n2  severe rat infestation, where rats and their droppings have been found in tents, under \n3  the slabs beneath the tents and even getting into the water supply.  Residents in Lot O \n4  have suffered rat bites and scratches, with rats crawling over them at night, and some \n5  residents, including the two of the Plaintiffs who reside there, became ill following the \n6  exposure. In September and October of 2024, over a hundred residents signed a petition \n7  to the City demanding something be done about the rats. A press conference was held \n8  on October 4, 2024, to bring the problem to the attention of the public and the City.  \n9  Following the press conference, the City took some steps to address the problem by \n10  calling in an exterminator.  However, though somewhat improved, there is still no safe \n11  place to store food, and the rats are still present at O camp, posing a risk to the residents. \n12  27.  “Safe sleeping” is in many respects less “safe’ than the conditions facing those  \n13  who have set up their own tents in other areas of downtown. Tents are usually placed \n14  a reasonable distance apart.  They are often placed under overhangs or in tunnels that \n15  provide some protection from sun and rain, moderating the temperature and conditions \n16  in the tents. They are also far closer to resources such as food and medical care, day \n17  centers or libraries to get warm or escape the heat during the day, and unhoused people \n18 \nin these tents have greater ability to cook and store food. In Plaintiffs’ experience, \n19 \nrodent infestations are far less common on the streets than at these camps.   \n20 \n28. The ongoing conditions in the B and O camps violate numerous California and \n21 \nCity of San Diego Health and Safety codes and regulations requiring the maintenance \n22 \nof safe and sanitary living conditions at shelters, and the timely correction of any \n23 \nviolations, see California Health & Safety Code §§17974–17974.6, including §17974.1 \n24 \n(requiring inspection and notice for substandard conditions in homeless shelters), \n25 \n§17974.2  (imposing  responsibility  for  correcting  violations),  and  §17974.4  (civil \n26 \nliability for failure to correct); §17970.5 (requiring complaint-based inspections and \n27 \nverification  of  corrective  actions  for  substandard  dwellings  including  homeless \n28 \nshelters); and further violate codes requiring that shelters comply with state and federal \n \n- 15 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.16     Page 16 of\n49\n \n1  disability  access  laws,  see  California  Health  &  Safety  Code  §19952  (requiring \n2  compliance with ADA and state accessibility standards); Defendants’ actions and \n3  inactions resulting in these conditions were and continue to be grossly negligent or \n4  taken with reckless disregard for the health and safety of Plaintiffs and other residents \n5  at the Camp. \n6  D. Plaintiffs’ Requests for Reasonable Accommodations and Defendants’ \n7  lack of timely, good faith, interactive process; Denial of disability access \n8  29.  On or about April 2 and 3, 2024, Plaintiff Tosha Alvarado submitted requests \n9  for reasonable accommodations to the ADA Compliance and Accessibility Office, \n10  operated by Defendant City of San Diego. The request was forwarded to the ADA \n11  office  by  Mitchelle  Woodson  of  Think  Dignity  and  requested  that  responses  be \n12  provided to her office. \n13  30.  Ms. Alvarado’s request in summary contained the following: \n14  a.  More space between her tent and others and to be permitted to use her \n15  own  canopy,  since  her  mental  health  symptoms  were  triggered  by \n16  crowds and lack of privacy; \n17  b.  That she be provided with adequate food—three meals a day—or, in the  \n18 \nalternative, safe food storage and cooking facilities on site, as she is \n19 \nunable at times to leave the camp due to her disabilities to get food, and \n20 \nneeds food to take her medication; \n21 \nc.  An adequate reliable shuttle service to get to medical appointments. \n22 \n31.  Ms. Woodson never received any response from defendant City of San Diego \n23 \nto these two reasonable accommodation requests. \n24 \n32.  On September 3, 2024, Plaintiffs Jeffrey Bradley and Karen Abood submitted, \n25 \nthrough their attorney, Ann Menasche, a request for reasonable accommodations to the \n26 \nCity’s ADA Compliance & Accessibility Office.  \n27 \n33.  Mr. Bradley’s request in summary contained the following: \n28 \na.  A camp area free of rats and rat droppings that interfere with sleep \n \n- 16 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.17     Page 17 of\n49\n \n1  and aggravate his depression and anxiety; \n2  b.  Access to clean air as the proximity to the freeway is aggravating \n3  his COPD. \n4  c.  More space between his tents and others and to use his own  \n5  Canopy as the lack of privacy and crowded conditions aggravate his \n6  anxiety. \n7  34.  Ms. Abood’s request in summary contained the following: \n8  a.  Camp area free of rats and rat droppings that aggravate her PTSD, \n9  anxiety and depression; \n10  b.  An effective way of cooling her tent, such as allowing use of a canopy, \n11  as over 100-degree Fahrenheit temperatures aggravate her migraines. \n12  c.  More space between her tent and others, and use of a canopy, since \n13  crowded conditions and lack of privacy aggravate her anxiety and PTSD.  \n14  35.  Also on September 3, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel, Ann Menasche, sent a letter to \n15  Teresa Smith, CEO of Dreams for Change, requesting reasonable accommodations, as \n16  stated above, on behalf of all three Plaintiffs.  \n17  36.  Ms. Smith wrote again to Ms. Menasche on September 15, 2024, stating that \n18 \nshe had shared the letter with the City, and the City “is working with our Program \n19 \nmanager in regard to the requests that are out of our scope and require the City’s \n20 \nintervention.” \n21 \n37.  It was not until December 16, 2024, three months later, and subsequent to these \n22 \nPlaintiffs filing claims against the City as alleged below, that Plaintiffs Jeffrey Bradley \n23 \nand  Karen  Abood  received  written  responses  from  the  City  to  their  reasonable \n24 \naccommodation requests. The identical responses, signed by Homelessness Strategies \n25 \nand Solutions Department Manager Karen Carter, reviewed the provisions of the “Safe \n26  Sleeping” program and suggested contacting their case manager with PATH1, Kat \n27 \n \n28 \n1 PATH is a non-profit provider of homeless services that sometimes provides case management for homeless individuals \nwho may be residents of “Safe Sleeping” program.  They are not directly involved with the operation of the program. \n \n- 17 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.18     Page 18 of\n49\n \n1  Moore, “to advocate directly with Dreams for Change staff to help identify a site to \n2  reduce the number of surrounding tents and assist with your transition.”    \n3  38.  Plaintiffs’  counsel  contacted  Kat  Moore  who  referred  the  issue  to  her \n4  supervisor. There has been no further response or communication from either PATH, \n5  the  City,  or  Dreams  for  Change,  with  regard  to  Mr.  Bradley  and  Ms.  Abood’s \n6  accommodation requests. \n7  39.  No responses were ever received from the City to Tosha Alverez’s written \n8  Reasonable Accommodations request. \n9  40.  Plaintiff John Borja submitted a request for reasonable accommodations to the \n10  Dreams for Change staff onsite at the “B” lot on multiple occasions while staying at \n11  the lot.  \n12  41.  Mr. Borja’s request in summary contained the following:  \n13  a.  That the Dreams for Change staff at the “B Lot” cease unplugging his \n14  CPAP machine, which he relies on to sleep safely and prevent his airways \n15  from collapsing. \n16  Mr. Borja’s request to keep his medically necessary CPAP machine plugged in was \n17  ignored, resulting in ongoing, active, and substantial risk to his health & his life. He \n18 \nfiled a formal grievance in December of 2024 with Dreams for Change, which was also \n19 \nignored.  Instead, staff mocked him and threatened him with being “kicked out” of the \n20 \nprogram.  \n21 \n42.  Plaintiff Liam Burton submitted a request for reasonable accommodation to the \n22  Dreams for Change staff on or about June 26th, 2025.  \n23 \n43.  Mr. Burton’s request in summary contained the following:  \n24 \na.  That Dreams for Change staff at the “B Lot” provide him with increased \n25 \nprivacy, as his PTSD is exacerbated by overcrowded environments. \n26 \n44.  The  staff  offered  Mr.  Burton  a  placement  that  still  failed  to  provide  the \n27 \nminimum level of privacy necessary to avoid aggravating his CPTSD. \n28 \n \n- 18 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.19     Page 19 of\n49\n \n1  45.  Plaintiff Timothy Allen submitted a request for reasonable accommodation to \n2  the Dreams for Change staff on or about May 8, 2025. \n3  46.  Mr. Allen’s request in summary contained the following:  \n4  a.  That the Dreams for Change staff at the “B Lot” allow him to keep his \n5  emotional support puppy, without requiring that the animal be neutered. Mr. \n6  Allen’s request included written verification from his treating doctor of his \n7  need for the assistance animal, due to his disabilities. \n8  b.   The Staff disregarded the request, was about to exit him, and only allowed \n9  Mr. Allen to stay at the camp with the puppy after Attorney Ann Menasche \n10  intervened.  \n11  c.  Shortly thereafter, he was exited from the lot on a ninety-day suspension, \n12  ostensibly for entering the lot after curfew and being “disrespectful” of staff, \n13  the latter of which he denies. Mr. Allen is informed and believes that both \n14  accusations were pretexts for the Staff’s retaliatory action in exiting Mr. \n15  Allen  in  response  to  him  exercising  his  right  to  request  reasonable \n16  accommodations under the law. Plaintiff Allen was denied proper notice and \n17  opportunity to be heard prior to being exited. Mr. Allen has had no place to \n18 \ngo but to return to the streets and risk arrest for violation of the City’s \n19 \nhomeless ordinance.  \n20 \n47.  Plaintiff Laura Zaleta has spinal compression, which requires her to use a walker \n21 \nto navigate the camp. She is also reliant on the only available accessible shower, as it \n22 \nis the only shower she can safely use. The only accessible shower at B lot was out of \n23 \nservice for two months, despite repeated complaints. As a result, Laura developed sores \n24 \non her body. It was not repaired until the Health Department was notified. \n25 \n48.  Ms. Zaleta has submitted multiple complaints about the rough terrain at the  \n26 \n“B  Lot,”  but  her  concerns  have  repeatedly  been  ignored.  As  a  result,  she  has \n27 \nexperienced worsened pain and an exacerbation of her condition and also has broken \n28 \ntwo walkers navigating the uneven ground. \n \n- 19 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.20     Page 20 of\n49\n \n1  E. Plaintiffs’ Submission of Timely Claims to the City. \n2  49.  On November 6, 2024, Plaintiffs Jeffrey Bradley, Karen Abood and Tosha \n3  Alvarado each submitted claim forms to the City of San Diego Risk Management \n4  Department claiming damages for ongoing violations of their rights.   \n5  50.  On  December  19,  2024,  said  Plaintiffs  provided  supplemental  information \n6  regarding the dates of loss clarifying that the claims for substandard conditions began \n7  on the dates each of them arrived at the camps respectively, and continuing thereafter; \n8  and that the claims for failure to provide reasonable accommodate arose on the dates \n9  each submitted his or her request and continuing thereafter.  \n10  51.  On July 10, 2025, Plaintiffs ALLEN, BURTON, SCALLAN, BORJA, and \n11  ZALETA submitted Claim forms to the City regarding their treatment at the Camps. \n12  Because these claims are ongoing, they are considered timely filed under Government \n13  Code §911.2.  \n14  F. Defendants’ retaliatory actions towards plaintiffs in response to requests \n15  for reasonable accommodation and assertion of their rights.  \n16  52.  Plaintiff  Jeffrey  Bradley  requested  reasonable  accommodations  for  his \n17  disabilities from the City and Dreams for Change as alleged above.  \n18 \n53.  On September 23, 2024, Attorney Ann Menasche sent an email to Teresa Smith, \n19 \nCEO  of  Dreams  for  Change,  regarding  the  request  that  Defendants  approve  Mr. \n20 \nBradley’s reasonable accommodation requests. The day after this communication, staff \n21 \nat the “O lot” informed Mr. Bradley that they intended to search his tent to ensure he \n22 \ndid not possess any prohibited items, even though there were no grounds for doing so.  \n23 \n54.  Mr. Bradley objected, stating that the staff had no right to search his personal \n24 \nbelongings without cause.  \n25 \n55.  Shortly thereafter, while Mr. Bradley was away from the camp for less than two \n26 \nweeks,  staff  at  the  “O  lot”  discarded  his  personal  belongings  and  allowed  other \n27 \nresidents to take what remained. \n28 \n/// \n \n- 20 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.21     Page 21 of\n49\n \n1  56.  Upon Mr. Bradley’s return, he requested a tent and sleeping bag, but staff stated \n2  they were unable to provide these items. \n3  57.  As a result, Mr. Bradley had to rely on blankets obtained from other residents, \n4  which were the only items available for him to sleep with at night. \n5  58.  On  or  about  October  4,  2024,  Plaintiff  Karen  Abood  spoke  to  the  media \n6  regarding  the  unsuitable  and  inhumane  conditions  at  the  camp,  where  unhoused \n7  individuals were being compelled to reside to avoid criminalization. \n8  59.  Following her return to the camp, staff at the “O lot” began referring to Ms. \n9  Abood as the “media girl” and confronted her by stating, “Why would you do that? \n10  Don’t you want to continue living here?” \n11  60.  Shortly after Attorney Menasche’s intervention regarding Plaintiff Timothy \n12  Allen’s reasonable accommodation requested as described above, Mr. Allen was exited \n13  from the “B lot” for allegedly returning past curfew—a minor rule violation for which \n14  other residents are not typically removed from the program. \n15  61.  Plaintiff John Borja was also threatened with being exited for complaining about \n16  the unplugging of his C-PAP machine. \n17  62.  In or around April of 2025, Plaintiff Paul Scallan was retaliated against by staff, \n18 \nwho, after telling Mr. Scallan he needed to switch tents, demanded he place all his \n19 \npersonal property into two small bins, or they would be thrown away. He reported that \n20 \nhe may be moving to VA housing soon and expressed his concerns, noting that he \n21 \nbelieved it was unconstitutional to throw his personal property away, and underscored \n22 \nthat he did not want any of his belongings thrown away. The staff member told Mr. \n23 \nScallan he was a “thorn in her ass” and marched away with his tent. Mr. Scallan had to \n24 \nleave for the evening and assumed he would be issued a new tent the following day. \n25 \n63.  Instead, in retaliation for Mr. Scallan reporting his concerns, staff removed his \n26 \ntent and left his personal property out in the open on the wood platform where his tent \n27 \nhad been located. Mr. Scallan checked in with staff every day for twelve days for his \n28 \n \n- 21 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.22     Page 22 of\n49\n \n1  new tent. Because staff inexplicably would not issue him a tent, he ended up back on \n2  the streets in downtown San Diego.  \n3  64.  Mr. Scallan was so desperate to get a tent and secure his belongings that he went \n4  onto the “Nextdoor” app and shared that Dreams for Change was refusing to issue his \n5  tent. Upon information and belief, several concerned citizens called the mayor’s office \n6  to report their concerns. After Mr. Scallan’s public campaign to be treated fairly, he \n7  finally received a new tent, twelve days after staff had removed his tent.  \n8  65.  Despite that Mr. Scallan was issued a new tent, residents overheard staff being \n9  instructed to throw all of Mr. Scallan’s personal property away in a dumpster, which \n10  they did.  \n11  66.  The incidents outlined above reflect a pattern of retaliation by Defendants in \n12  response to Plaintiffs’ exercise of their protected rights.  \n13  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n[Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3604 et seq.] \n14 \nAgainst All Defendants \n15   \n67.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n16 \npreceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n17 \n68.  Plaintiffs plead this claim against all Defendants. The City’s “Safe Sleeping \n18 \nProgram” operated at “B Lot” and “O Lot” are designed or intended for occupancy by \n19 \nhomeless persons as their residences. Plaintiffs and other homeless persons accepted \n20 \ninto the program are assigned specific tents to live in which are available to them 24 \n21 \nhours per day. Residents stay for months or years at a time and have nowhere else to \n22 \nreturn to. As in many other government subsidized housing programs, the cost of rent \n23 \nfor residing at the dwelling units is paid for by City and State funds, which Plaintiffs \n24 \ncontribute to as taxpayers. \n25 \n69.  Because the tents and common areas at “B Lot” and “O Lot” are more than a \n26 \nplace of temporary sojourn or transient visit for its residents, they are therefore \n27 \n/// \n28 \n \n- 22 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.23     Page 23 of\n49\n \n1  70.  “dwellings” as defined by the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) 42 \n2  U.S.C. §3602(b). See 24 C.F.R. §100.201; Woods v. Foster, 884 F. Supp. 1169, 1173-\n3  1174).   \n4  71.  The FHAA makes it unlawful for a housing provider “[t]o discriminate in the \n5  sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or \n6  renter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter, a person residing in or intending \n7  to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented, or made available; or any person \n8  associated with that buyer or renter.” 42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(1); 24 C.F.R. §100.202(a).  \n9  72.  The FHAA also makes it unlawful to fail to design and construct multi-dwelling \n10  units for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, so that public use and common use \n11  portions of the dwellings are readily accessible and usable by persons with disabilities. \n12  42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(3)(c).  There must be an accessible route into and through the \n13  dwelling. 56 FR 9472. “Accessible route” means “a continuous unobstructed path \n14  connecting accessible elements and spaces in a building…that can be negotiated by a \n15  person with a severe disability using a wheelchair and that is also safe for and usable \n16  by people with other disabilities…” 53 FR 4492, §100.201. \n17  73.  It is further unlawful under the FHAA “[t]o discriminate against any person in \n18 \nthe terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision \n19 \nof services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a handicap of that \n20 \nperson; or a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold or \n21 \n made available; or any person associated with that person.” 42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(2); 24 \n22 \nC.F.R. §100.202(b). \n23 \n  74.  Discrimination  under  the  FHAA  includes  “a  refusal  to  make  reasonable \n24 \naccommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations \n25 \nmay be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” \n26 \n42 U.S.C. §3604(3)(B); 24 C.F.R. §100.204(a); U.S.C. §3604(f)(7)(A). \n27 \n75. “B” and “O” camps were constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991. \n28 \n \n- 23 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.24     Page 24 of\n49\n \n1  76.  Plaintiffs  are  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities  within  the  meaning  of \n2  FHAA.  \n3  77. Defendants’ actions and omissions discriminate against Plaintiffs because of \n4  their disability in violation of the FHAA. Defendants’ discriminatory conduct includes \n5  but is not limited to:  \n6  •  Failure to design and construct the properties utilized for the “Safe Sleeping \n7  Program” so that the common use portion of the camps and the areas for \n8  entering and leaving the camps are readily accessible and usable by people with \n9  disabilities with an accessible route; \n10  •  Failure to provide timely and appropriate responses to Plaintiffs’ requests for \n11 \nreasonable  accommodation,  instead  ignoring  the  requests,  deflecting  the \n12 \nresponsibility on other defendants and/or responding many months later merely \n13 \ndescribing the current program offerings without offering modifications to \n14 \nmeet Plaintiffs’ disability related needs; and \n15 \n•  Failing,  delaying,  or  improperly  conducting  maintenance  to  prevent  the \n16 \nproliferation of rats, mice and other vermin that threaten the health and safety \n17 \nof all the residents but disproportionately impact Plaintiffs and others with \n18 \nphysical and mental disabilities. \n19 \n•  Failing to implement lawful reasonable accommodation policies to ensure  \n20 \nan  established  process,  clear  allocation  of  responsibility,  and  prompt  and \n21 \nappropriate responses to the reasonable accommodation requests of Plaintiffs \n22 \nand other residents with disabilities so that they have equal access to the \n23 \nbenefits of the “Safe Sleeping” shelter program.  \n24 \n78.  The Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C §3617 prohibits coercion, intimidation, threats, \n25 \nor any interference with any person in the exercise of their protected rights under \n26 \nthe Fair Housing Act.  \n27 \n79. Plaintiffs engaged in protected activity under the Fair Housing Act, including \n28 \n \n- 24 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.25     Page 25 of\n49\n \n1  requesting reasonable accommodations and speaking out against unlawful housing \n2  practices. 42 U.S.C. § 3617. In response, Defendants retaliated against plaintiffs by \n3  threatening eviction (“exiting”), eviction, destroying personal property, denying access \n4  to basic shelter or services, and subjected Plaintiffs to targeted harassment, which is in \n5  violation of 42 U.S.C. §3617. \n6  80. Defendants’ retaliatory conduct was intended to deter Plaintiffs from exercising  \n7  their rights under the Fair Housing Act, including the right to request reasonable \n8  accommodations,  and  from  speaking  out  against  the  unsafe,  inaccessible  and \n9  discriminatory conditions within the camps. 42 U.S.C. §3617.  \n10  81.  Defendants’ discriminatory and wrongful conduct is ongoing. Defendants’  \n11  violations of the FHAA have harmed and will continue to harm Plaintiffs in the future.  \n12  82.  Defendants maintain a pattern and practice of denying Plaintiffs full and equal  \n13  access to their tents by failing to maintain accessible paths of travel in and out of the \n14  camps. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to redress the wrongs set forth herein. \n15  Declaratory and injunctive relief are therefore appropriate remedies.  \n16  83.  As a direct and proximate cause of defendants’ discriminatory conduct,  \n17  Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer emotional distress, loss of civil rights, \n18 \nphysical harm and exacerbation of their disabilities entitling them to actual damages.  \n19 \n84. The conduct of defendants and each of them was willful, oppressive, and/o  \n20 \nfraudulent and involved reckless disregard or callous indifference to Plaintiffs’ rights.  \n21 \n85.  Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs are entitled to actual damages, punitive  \n22 \nand exemplary damages and injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneys’ fees and costs \n23 \nas set forth below. \n24 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Substantive Due Process – Reckless Endangerment \n25 \n(Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. §1983) \n26 \nAgainst Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO \n \n27 \n86.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in the  \n28 \npreceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n \n- 25 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.26     Page 26 of\n49\n \n1  87.  Under the Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the  \n2  state deprives a person of a substantive due process right if it affirmatively places the \n3  person in a position of danger. Wood v. Ostrander, 875 F. 2d 578, 583 (9th Cir. 1989). \n4  88.  Defendant City of San Diego has acted and continues to act affirmatively \n5  as described herein and with reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ \n6  health and safety to coerce Plaintiffs, lacking viable indoor shelter and affordable \n7  housing options and facing the constant threat of police harassment, citation and arrest \n8  by the City, into a highly dangerous situation – a residence in the City-operated highly \n9  unsafe “Safe Sleeping Program.”    \n10  89.  Residing in the tent encampments elevates the risk of harm to Plaintiffs and  \n11  places them in grave danger of serious physical illness and even death from exposure \n12  to  rodents  and  their  droppings,  mold,  malnutrition,  food  poisoning,  hypothermia, \n13  hyperthermia, and fire, among other serious and life-threatening conditions prevalent \n14  or at high risk of occurring at the camps.  In addition, the poor and overcrowded living \n15  conditions of the City’s camps aggravate Plaintiffs’ mental and physical disabilities, \n16  causing additional and ongoing pain and suffering. \n17  90.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violations stated herein and  \n18 \nare therefore entitled to injunctive, declaratory, and equitable relief.  Plaintiffs are also \n19 \nentitled to attorneys’ fees and costs. \n20 \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Title II Americans with Disabilities Act \n21 \nAgainst Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO \n22 \n91.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in the  \n23 \npreceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n24 \n92.  Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12132 provides: [N]o qualified individual with  \n25 \na disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \n26 \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be \n27 \nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity. \n28 \n93.  Plaintiffs are “qualified persons with disabilities” as defined under the ADA. 42  \n \n- 26 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.27     Page 27 of\n49\n \n1  U.S.C. §12102; 42 U.S.C. §12131; 28 C.F.R. §35.104. \n2  94.  Under the ADA’s broad language, a “program, service, or activity” includes  \n3  with its scope “anything a public entity does.” Yeskey v. Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corr., \n4  118 F. 3d 168, 171 & n. 5 (3d Cir. 1997), aff’d 524 U.S. 206 (1998) (quoting 28 C.F.R. \n5  Pt. 35, App. A, preamble to ADA regulations.) \n6  95.  The City’s “Safe Sleeping Program” is a service, program or activity of the City  \n7  of San Diego. \n8  96.  Title II protects people with disabilities against facially neutral policies that  \n9  burden people with disabilities more than others, by requiring that the public entity \n10  provide reasonable modifications to avoid the discrimination unless the public entity \n11  can demonstrate that such modifications would result in a fundamental alteration of the \n12  program. 28 C.F.R. §35.130(b)(7); Crowder v. Kitagawa, 81 F. 3d 1480 (9th Cir. 1996).   \n13  97.  Under 42 U.S.C. §12203, it is unlawful for any public entity to discriminate  \n14  against, coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any individual who exercises \n15  their rights protected under the ADA. \n16  98.  By failing and refusing to reasonably modify its policies and practices as  \n17  described herein to allow Plaintiffs the necessary accommodations they requested, the \n18 \nCity of San Diego has discriminated against plaintiffs based on their disabilities.  \n19 \n99.  Title II regulations interpreting the ADA prohibit a public entity from utilizing  \n20 \ncriteria  or  methods  of  administration  that  have  the  effect  of  subjecting  qualified \n21 \nindividuals with disabilities to discrimination based on disability. 29 C.F.R. §35.130. \n22 \n100.   Defendant’s policies and practices in administering its “Safe Sleeping  \n23 \nProgram”  has  the  effect  of  discriminating  against  and  imposing  disproportionate \n24 \nburdens on Plaintiffs based on their disabilities, aggravating their physical and mental \n25 \nhealth conditions, and denying them the full benefits and amenities of the Program \n26 \nenjoyed by and available to people without disabilities. \n27 \n101.   In carrying out Defendant’s policies and practices as described herein,  \n28 \n \n- 27 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.28     Page 28 of\n49\n \n1  Defendant has utilized criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of \n2  subjecting  Plaintiffs  to  discrimination  based  on  their  disabilities.  29  C.F.R. \n3  §35.130(b)(3); §42 U.S.C. §12203.  \n4  102.   In response to Plaintiffs’ requests for reasonable accommodations,  \n5  Defendant engaged in retaliatory acts, including but not limited to threats of eviction, \n6  actual eviction or suspension, denial of essential services, and confiscation of personal \n7  property in violation of 42 U.S.C. §12203.  \n8  103.   In carrying out Defendant’s policies and practices as herein described,  \n9  and  unreasonably  delaying  and  denying  Plaintiffs’  requests  for  reasonable \n10  modifications in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the ADA, Defendant has acted \n11  knowingly and with deliberate indifference to harms substantially likely to occur.  \n12  104.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant City of San Diego’s ongoing  \n13  unlawful acts and omissions, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer injuries, \n14  including emotional injuries and physical harms, and are entitled to compensatory \n15  damages, including damages for emotional distress. In addition, Plaintiffs have no \n16  adequate remedy at law and are therefore entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, \n17  restitution and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n18 \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Title III Americans with Disabilities Act \n19 \nAgainst Defendants DREAMS FOR CHANGE and \n20 \nDOWNTOWN PARTNERSHIP \n \n21 \n105.   Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in \n22 \nThe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n23 \n106.  Title III of the ADA and its implementing regulations entitle individuals \n24 \nwith disabilities to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, \n25 \nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation. 42 \n26 \nU.S.C. §12182(a); 28 C.F.R. §36.201(a).  \n27 \n107.   Places of public accommodation include a homeless shelter or other  \n28 \n \n- 28 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.29     Page 29 of\n49\n \n1  social  services  center  establishments.  Lot  B  and  Lot  O  are  places  of  public \n2  accommodation covered by Title III of the ADA.28 C.F.R. §36.104.  \n3  108.  Title III requires public accommodations to make reasonable  \n4  modifications to policies, practices, and procedures when necessary to afford equal \n5  access  to  goods,  services,  facilities,  privileges,  advantages  or  accommodations  to \n6  people with disabilities. 42 U.S. Code §12182(b)(2)(A)(ii).  \n7  109.  Title III further requires that public accommodations remove barriers to  \n8  access when readily achievable. The ADA also mandates that public accommodations \n9  make their transportation services accessible to individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S. \n10  Code §12182(b)(1)(A)(iii). \n11  110.   Under 42 U.S.C. § 12203, it is unlawful to intimidate, threaten, coerce,  \n12  or interfere with any individual for exercising their rights under the ADA, or to \n13  discriminate against any person for opposing practices made unlawful by the Act. \n14  111.   Defendants have failed and refused to timely provide the necessary  \n15  reasonable modifications requested by Plaintiffs; have failed to remove barriers to \n16  access where doing so would have been readily achievable; have failed to make their \n17  transportation  services  fully  accessible;  and  have  further  utilized  methods  of \n18 \nadministration that denied Plaintiffs full and equal enjoyment of the services offered.  \n19 \n112.  Defendants have responded to Plaintiffs’ reasonable accommodation  \n20 \nrequests  and  complaints  regarding  accessibility  with  silence  and  with  retaliatory \n21 \nconduct,  including  threats  of  eviction,  eviction,  and  confiscation  and  disposal  of \n22 \nPlaintiffs’ personal belongings, further subjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination based on \n23 \ntheir disabilities. \n24 \n113.   Defendants’ conduct constitutes ongoing and continuous violations of the  \n25 \n114.  ADA, and unless restrained from doing so, Defendants will continue to  \n26 \nviolate the ADA in its operation of the Safe Sleeping program. This conduct, unless \n27 \nenjoined, will continue to inflict injuries for which plaintiffs have no adequate remedy \n28 \nat law.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief under section 308 of the \n \n- 29 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.30     Page 30 of\n49\n \n1  ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12188(a) as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees sand costs, 42 U.S.C. \n2  §12205.    \n3  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDisability Discrimination under FEHA – Failure to \n4 \nProvide a Reasonable Accommodation  \n5  (Government Code §§12927, subd. (c)(1) and §12955, et.seq.) \nAgainst All Defendants \n6 \n \n115.   Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in  \n7 \nThe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n8 \n116.  Government Code §12955(a) prohibits owners of housing  \n9 \naccommodations from discriminating against any person because of his/her disability. \n10 \n117.  Government Code §12955.3 defines \"disability\" to include \"any physical  \n11 \nor mental disability as defined in Section 12926.\" Section 12926, subdivision (j)(1) \n12 \ndefines  \"mental  disability\"  to  include  \"any  mental  or  psychological  disorder  or \n13 \ncondition, such as‚ emotional or mental illness‚ that limits a major life activity.\" \n14 \n118.  Any condition that limits almost any major life activity qualifies as a  \n15 \ndisability. \"Major life activities\" is \"broadly construed\" to cover \"physical, mental, and \n16 \nsocial activities and working.\" (Gov. Code, §§12955.3, 12926, subd. (j)(1)(C).) As \n17 \ndetailed herein, all Plaintiffs' physical and mental conditions make it difficult for them \n18 \n19  to sleep, work, and otherwise go about their daily lives and interfere with their full use \n20  and enjoyment of their housing and therefore qualify as disabilities under the FEHA. \n21  119.  Anxiety, depression, PTSD, Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD),  \n22  ADHD, bipolar disorder, mania, neurodivergence, learning disabilities and Plaintiffs’ \n23  other mental health conditions qualify as mental disabilities. “Numerous cases under \n24  state and federal law have held that depression and its related manifestations can meet \n25  the definition of disability under antidiscrimination laws.” (Auburn Woods I, supra, 121 \n26  Cal.App.4th at pp. 1592-3; see also Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th \n27  245, 258-9 [post-traumatic stress disorder qualified as a disability];  \n28 \n \n- 30 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.31     Page 31 of\n49\n \n1  Criado v. IBM Corporation (1st Cir. 1998) 145 F.3d 437, 442 [plaintiff with adjustment \n2  disorder, ADD, and anxiety qualified as disabled.]) \n3  120.  The “Safe Sleeping Program” operated by Defendants at the two locations  \n4  consisting of rows of tents placed on wooden pallets, bathroom and shower facilities \n5  and communal areas set up for meals, are structures occupied as or intended for \n6  occupancy  by  homeless  persons  as  their  residences  and  are  therefore  “housing \n7  accommodations” as defined by Government Code §13927(d) and covered by the \n8  provisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act.   \n9  121.  Section 12927(c)(1) of the California Government Code defines housing  \n10  discrimination to include the refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, \n11  policies, practices, or services when such accommodations are necessary to afford \n12  individuals  with  disabilities  an  equal  opportunity  to  use  and  enjoy  a  dwelling. \n13  Harassment and retaliation done in response to the request for such accommodations \n14  constitutes unlawful discrimination. \n15  122.  Section 12955(f) of the California Government Code prohibits housing  \n16  providers from harassing, evicting, or otherwise discriminating against individuals in \n17  retaliation for opposing unlawful housing practices, reporting such practices to law \n18 \nenforcement, participating in legal proceedings, or assisting others in exercising their \n19 \nhousing rights. \n20 \n123.  Title 2 California Code of Regulations §12176 requires housing providers \n21 \nto make reasonable accommodations unless doing so would impose an undue financial \n22 \nor administrative burden or fundamentally alter the nature of the housing program.  \n23 \n124.  Title 2 California Code of Regulations §12177 requires housing providers  \n24 \nto engage in a timely, good-faith interactive process when a request for reasonable \n25 \naccommodation or modification is received and cannot be immediately granted. \n26 \n125.  The interactive process facilitates the exchange of information to identify  \n27 \nand implement a reasonable accommodation that ensures equal opportunity to use and \n28 \nenjoy a dwelling. Cal. Code Regs. Title 2, §12177. Good faith includes making an \n \n- 31 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.32     Page 32 of\n49\n \n1  honest effort to consider the request, seeking clarification if the disability or need is \n2  unclear, and proposing equally effective alternatives if the original request is not \n3  feasible. Id.  \n4  126.  A provider may not deny a request due to insufficient information without  \n5  first requesting clarification and allowing a reasonable opportunity to respond. Cal. \n6  Code Regs. tit. 2, § 12177. Undue delay may constitute a denial, and failure to reach \n7  an agreement after reasonable efforts is effectively a denial. Id. \n8  127.  Plaintiffs’ requested reasonable accommodations are necessary to afford  \n9  them an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their dwelling. Defendants either failed to \n10  respond, denied the requests outright, engaged in unreasonable delay, or otherwise \n11  refused  to  engage  in  the  interactive  process  in  violation  of  the  California  Fair \n12  Employment and Housing Act and implementing regulations. \n13  128.  In retaliation for asserting their right to reasonable accommodations,  \n14  Defendants engaged in retaliatory conduct against Plaintiffs including, but not limited \n15  to: harassment, threats of eviction and/or termination from the program, and eviction \n16  of Plaintiffs in retaliation for their reasonable accommodation requests, in violation of \n17  Cal. Gov't Code § 12955.  \n18 \n129.  Defendants' actions and omissions discriminated against Plaintiffs based  \n19 \non their disabilities, denying them equal use and enjoyment of housing and were in \n20 \nretaliation  for  Plaintiffs  asserting  their  rights,  in  violation  of  Government  Code \n21 \n§12927(c)(1), §12955(a), §12955(f), and Cal. Code Regs. Title 2, §12176 and §12177.  \n22 \n130.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendants’ unlawful failure and \n23 \nrefusal to provide reasonable accommodations, Plaintiffs have suffered, continue to \n24 \nsuffer and will continue to suffer damages and injury as described above. \n25 \n131.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and are therefore entitled to an  \n26 \ninjunction  and  other  equitable  remedies  provided  under  Government  Code \n27 \n§12989.2(a).  \n28 \n132.

Code §12927(c)(1); §12955(a); and §§12955.8(a) & (b)) \n4  Against All Defendants \n \n5 \n133.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in \n6 \nthe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n7 \n134.  Section 12955, subdivision (a) prohibits owners of housing  \n8 \naccommodations from discriminating against any person because of his/her disability. \n9 \n135.  Section 12927, subdivision (c)(1) defines “discrimination” to include  \n10 \n“refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services \n11 \nwhen these accommodations may be necessary to afford a disabled person equal \n12 \nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” \n13 \n136.  Section 12955.8, provides that “[p]roof of an intentional violation of this  \n14 \narticle includes, but is not limited to, an act or failure to act … that demonstrates an \n15 \nintent to discriminate in any manner in violation of this part.” \n16 \n137.  The “Safe Sleeping Program” operated by Defendants at the two locations  \n17 \nconsisting of rows of tents placed on concrete slabs, bathroom and shower facilities \n18 \nand communal areas set up for meals, are structures occupied as or intended for \n19 \noccupancy  by  homeless  persons  as  their  residences  and  are  therefore  “housing \n20 \naccommodations” as defined by Government Code § 13927(d) and covered by the \n21 \nprovisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act.   \n22 \n138.  As detailed herein, Defendants violated the requirement to engage in the  \n23 \ninteractive process with Plaintiffs by ignoring reasonable accommodation requests, by \n24 \nrefusing to engage in negotiations, delaying responses to requests for so long they were \n25 \nby default denied, by failing to have any or adequate standards for accommodations, \n26 \nand  other  such  acts.  Under  the  FEHA,  a  landlord  faced  with  a  request  for \n27 \naccommodation by a tenant with a disability is obligated to “open a dialogue” with the \n28 \ntenant  as  “part  of  an  interactive  process  in  which  each  party  seeks  and  shares \n \n- 33 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.34     Page 34 of\n49\n \n1  information.” (Auburn Woods I, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 1598.) “If a landlord is \n2  skeptical  of  a  tenant’s  alleged  disability  or  the  landlord’s  ability  to  provide  an \n3  accommodation, it is incumbent upon the landlord to request documentation or open a \n4  dialogue. [Citation.]” (Ibid.). \n5  139.  Defendants' refusal and/or failure to engage in the interactive process,  \n6  refusal to negotiate with Plaintiffs regarding their reasonable accommodation requests, \n7  denying and withholding housing accommodations, and exiting/evicting them from the \n8  Lots constitute unlawful housing discrimination. \n9  140.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendants’ unlawful failure and  \n10  refusal to provide reasonable accommodations, Plaintiffs have suffered, continue to \n11  suffer and will continue to suffer damages and injury as described above. \n12  141.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and are therefore entitled to an  \n13  injunction  and  other  equitable  remedies  provided  under  Government  Code \n14  §12989.2(a), in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory \n15  and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs, as set forth below. \n16  SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations of the California Unruh Act \n17 \nAgainst All Defendants \n18 \n  \n19 \n142.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every contained allegation in \n20 \nthe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n21 \n143.  A violation of the right of any individual under the ADA is also a violation  \n22 \nof  the  Unruh  Act,  California  Civil  Code  §51(f).  Defendant  City  of  San  Diego's \n23 \nhomeless  housing  initiative  “Safe  Sleeping  Program”  operated  by  the  City  in \n24 \nconjunction with Defendants Dreams for Change and Downtown Partnership is a \n25 \n\"business establishment” as defined by the Unruh Act, Ca. Civil Code §51. \n26 \n144.  The Unruh Act guarantees, inter alia, that persons with disabilities are    \n27 \nentitled to full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges or services \n28 \nin all business establishments of every kind whatsoever within the jurisdiction of the \n \n- 34 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.35     Page 35 of\n49\n \n1  State of California.  The Unruh Act further provides that a violation of the rights of any \n2  individual under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§12101, et seq., shall also constitute a violation \n3  of the Unruh Act. Defendants have violated the Unruh Act by, inter alia, denying \n4  Plaintiffs,  who  have  disabilities,  the  full  and  equal  accommodations,  advantages, \n5  facilities, privileges or services offered by defendants. Defendants have further violated \n6  the Unruh Act by violating Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§12132 et seq., and the \n7  regulations promulgated thereunder, as alleged in Plaintiffs' Third Claim for Relief. \n8  145.  Defendants acted intentionally to discriminate in public accommodations \n9  in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civ. Code, §51(a) by denying Plaintiffs, \n10  who are individuals with disabilities, equal access to the “Safe Sleeping Program.” \n11  Defendants’ acts and omissions are also a violation of Title II and III of the ADA and \n12  are therefore a violation of Civ. Code §51(f). \n13  146.   Defendants retaliated against Plaintiffs for asserting their right to request  \n14  a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. Defendants’ retaliation included, but \n15  were not limited to: acts such as threats of eviction, actual eviction, and the disposal of \n16  personal belongings, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §12203 and pursuant to California Civil \n17  Code § 51(f), also constitutes a violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  \n18 \n147.  Defendants have violated the Unruh Act by, inter alia, failing to operate  \n19 \nits services on a nondiscriminatory basis; failing to afford Plaintiffs access as necessary \n20 \nto the “Safe Sleeping Program” and failing to ensure that personnel are trained to \n21 \nproficiency  regarding  the  nondiscriminatory  provision  of  services  to  people  with \n22 \ndisabilities such as Plaintiffs. \n23 \n148.   The Unruh Act violations by Defendants have been intentional in that  \n24 \nDefendants have engaged in acts, practices or omissions that have the foreseeable effect \n25 \nof discriminating against homeless individuals with disabilities such as Plaintiffs.  \n26 \n149.   Pursuant to the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in California  \n27 \nCivil  Code  §52,  plaintiffs  judgment  for  actual  damages,  treble  damages  with  a \n28 \nminimum statutory damage award of $4,000, and attorneys’ fees as set forth below. \n \n- 35 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.36     Page 36 of\n49\n \n1  150.  Defendants are engaged in conduct of resistance to the full enjoyment of \n2  rights of people with disabilities as described herein. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to \n3  preventative relief including a permanent or temporary injunction and other equitable \n4  relief. Ca. Civil Code §52(c)(3).  \n5  EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Unfair Business Practices Act        \n6 \n[Bus. & Prof. Code §§17200 et seq.] \n7  Against All Defendants \n \n8 \n151.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in \n9 \nthe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n10 \n152.  The above practices impose on Plaintiffs and other residents of the camps  \n11 \nconditions  of  life  unfit  for  human  habitation,  and  thus  constitute  unfair  business \n12 \npractices in violation of the Unfair Business Practices Act, Business and Professions \n13 \nCode §§17200 et seq. \n14 \n153.  The above discriminatory conduct violates the Unruh Civil Rights Act,  \n15 \nCal.  Civ.  Code  §  51,  which  prohibits  discrimination  by  business  establishments. \n16 \nBecause these acts occurred in connection with the operation and administration of a \n17 \npublicly managed shelter program, and such conduct is expressly prohibited by law, it \n18 \nconstitutes an unlawful business practice within the meaning of California Business \n19 \nand Professions Code § 17200. Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn., 496 P.2d 817 \n20 \n(Cal. 1972). People v. McKale, 602 P.2d 731 (Cal. 1979). \n21 \n154.  The unlawful business practices of Defendants are likely to continue, and  \n22 \nthus, they will continue to harm the public by risking the health and safety of Plaintiffs \n23 \nand  other  Camp  residents  and perpetuating discrimination  based on  disability.  In \n24 \naddition, since diseases may spread beyond the residents of the camps and negatively \n25 \nimpact public health, and dangers of fire can jeopardize entire cities, Defendants’ unfair \n26 \nbusiness practices present a continuing public threat. California has a compelling \n27 \ninterest in eradicating discrimination and in providing shelters for unhoused individuals \n28 \n \n- 36 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.37     Page 37 of\n49\n \n1  that meet basic human needs to adequate food, safety, security, and shelter from the \n2  elements for its residents and that do not cause or spread disease or pose a fire hazard. \n3  155.   As a direct result of Defendants’ Unfair Business Practices including the \n4  conditions at the Camps, Plaintiffs have suffered injury in fact and have lost money \n5  and/or  property,  due  to  the  unsafe  and  discriminatory  conditions.  Plaintiffs  are \n6  therefore entitled to restitution for money or property lost. \n7  156.   Unless Defendants are restrained by a permanent injunction and other \n8  relief, Plaintiffs and the general public will suffer great and irreparable injury in that \n9  they suffer, or continue to suffer shame, humiliation, mental suffering, physical harm \n10  and economic loss. There is no other adequate remedy at law because pecuniary \n11  damages would not afford adequate relief. \n12  NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of California Government Code §11135 \n13 \nAgainst All Defendants \n14   \n 157.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n15 \npreceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n16 \n158.  Section 11135(a) of California Government Code provides in relevant \n17 \npart:\"[N]o person in the State of California shall, on the basis of ... disability, be \n18 \nunlawfully denied the benefits of, or be unlawfully subjected to discrimination under, \n19 \nany program or activity that is conducted, operated, or administered by the state or by \n20 \nany state agency, is funded directly by the state, or receives any financial assistance \n21 \nfrom the state.\"    \n22 \n159. Section 11150 of the California Code of Regulations defines a \"program or \n23 \nactivity\" as \"any project, action or procedure undertaken directly by recipients of State \n24 \nsupport or indirectly by recipients through others by contracts, arrangements or  \n25 \nagreements, with respect to the public generally or with respect to any private or public \n26 \nentity.\" \n27 \n28 \n \n- 37 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.38     Page 38 of\n49\n \n1  160.   Section 11150 of the California Code of Regulations defines \"[ s]tate \n2  financial assistance\" as \"any grant, entitlement, loan, cooperative agreement, contract \n3  or  any  other  arrangement  by  which  a  State  agency provides  or  otherwise  makes \n4  available aid to recipients…”  \n5  161.  The City of San Diego is funded directly by the State of California and \n6  receives financial assistance from the State of California sufficient to invoke the \n7  coverage of Gov. Code §§11135, et seq. The City of San Diego was and is the recipient \n8  of such funding and financial assistance at all times relevant to the claims asserted in \n9  this Complaint. Defendants Dreams for Change and Downtown Partnership are in \n10  receipt of funding from the City of San Diego that consists of or contains such funds. \n11  162.  At all  times  relevant  to  this action,  Plaintiffs  were  and  are qualified \n12  individuals with disabilities within the meaning of Section 11135(c)(1) and meets the \n13  essential  requirements  for  the  receipt  of  the  services,  programs,  or  activities  of \n14  Defendant’s. Cal. Gov. Code §§1135; 12926(j). \n15  163.   Defendants have refused and failed to provide Plaintiffs with full and \n16  equal access to their facilities, programs, services and activities as required by Gov. \n17  Code §11135, et seq.  \n18 \n164.   Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. Unless the remedies and relief \n19 \nrequested herein are granted, Plaintiffs will continue to be discriminated against and \n20 \ndenied full and equal access to Defendant’s facilities, programs, services and activities. \n21 \nTENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Disabled Persons Act \n22 \n(California Civil Code §§54, 54.l and 54.3 \n23 \nAgainst All Defendants \n \n24 \n165.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in \n25 \nthe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n26 \n166.   Defendants’ “Safe Sleeping Program” is comprised of lodging places or \n27 \nplaces of public accommodation under Civil Code §54.1. \n28 \n \n- 38 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.39     Page 39 of\n49\n \n1  167.   Defendant’s  actions  and  omissions  as  above  stated,  including  the \n2  maintenance  of  discriminatory  policies  against  people  with  disabilities,  denied \n3  plaintiffs full and equal access as other members of the public, thereby discriminating \n4  against Plaintiffs based on disability in violation of Civil Code §§54 and 54.1. \n5  168.   As  a  direct  and  proximate  cause  of  Defendants’  unlawful  conduct, \n6  Plaintiffs have suffered, continue to suffer and will continue to suffer damages and \n7  injury as described more fully above. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to actual and \n8  statutory damages including treble damages as provided pursuant to Civil Code §54.3. \n9  169.  Plaintiffs are currently not seeking injunctive relief under Civil Code §55 \n10  as that relief is otherwise available under other statutes. \n11  ELEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Procedural Due Process \n12 \n[Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. §1983]  \n13  Against Defendant City of San Diego \n \n14 \n170.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in the  \n15 \npreceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n16 \n171.  Plaintiff Timothy Allen pleads this claim against all Defendants for violating \n17 \nPlaintiffs’ rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n18 \nUnited States Constitution.  \n19 \n172.  The 14th amendment provides that no State shall “deprive any person of \n20 \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” 42 U.S.C. §1983.  \n21 \n173.  At  all  relevant  times,  Defendants  controlled  and  managed  the  “Safe \n22 \nSleeping  Program”,  including  its  operation,  maintenance,  and  continued  use  of \n23 \ndesignated Camp locations for unhoused individuals including plaintiff Timothy Allen.  \n24 \n174.  Plaintiff Timothy Allen participated in the Safe Sleeping Program, which \n25 \nprovided his only available shelter and protected him from the risk of arrest and \n26 \nincarceration associated with sleeping on the streets. \n27 \n175.  Plaintiff Timothy Allen had and has a constitutionally protected property \n28 \ninterest in continued participation in the “Safe Sleeping” program. His interest is \n \n- 39 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.40     Page 40 of\n49\n \n1  protected under the Due Process Clause because exclusion from the program resulted \n2  in immediate deprivation of access to basic necessities and exposed him to substantial \n3  risk of harm. Am. Fed’n of Lab. v. Emp. Dev. Dep’t, 88 Cal.App.3d 815 (Cal. Ct. App. \n4  2d Dist. 1979).  \n5  176.  A property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment is not limited to real \n6  estate, personal property, or money. Constitutionally protected property interests may \n7  also include government benefits on which individuals rely for survival. Board of \n8  Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972). When such benefits are conferred by statute or \n9  policy and conditioned on specific eligibility criteria, they cannot be taken away \n10  without due process. Id. The government must provide an opportunity to be heard \n11  before terminating such benefits. Id. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of due \n12  process rights. See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970); Skelly v. State Personnel \n13  Bd., 15 Cal.3d 194, 539 P.2d 774 (1975). \n14  177.  Despite  the  seriousness  of  the  deprivation  and  Plaintiff’s  protected \n15  property interests, Defendants suspended him from the program without advanced \n16  notice, and without providing an opportunity for hearing or appeal prior to being exited. \n17  178.  As a result of this action, Mr. Allen was forced onto the streets with no \n18 \naccess to alternative shelter. He has been exposed to lack of shelter and risk of arrest \n19 \ncausing severe extreme emotional distress, worsening his anxiety and depression.  \n20 \n179.  Defendant’s  actions  deprived  Plaintiff  of  his  right  to  procedural  due \n21 \nprocess by failing to afford notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to terminating \n22 \nhis access to shelter.   \n23 \n180.  Defendant’s conduct reflects a broader policy, custom, or practice of \n24 \nsummarily expelling residents from the “Safe Sleeping” program without due process \n25 \nprotections, in violation of established constitutional standards. See Goldberg v. Kelly, \n26 \n397 U.S. 254 (1970); James v. City of Costa Mesa, 700 F.3d 394 (9th Cir. 2012). \n27 \n181.  As a direct and proximate result of the actions of staff at “B Lot” and the \n28 \nimplementation of its unconstitutional policies and practices, Plaintiff Timothy Allen \n \n- 40 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.41     Page 41 of\n49\n \n1  has suffered significant emotional distress, including the exacerbation of his pre-\n2  existing depression and anxiety, due to the threat of losing his emotional support \n3  animal. Mr. Allen now resides outdoors in shrubbery adjacent to “B Lot” in an effort \n4  to avoid arrest. As a result, he continues to experience severe emotional distress and \n5  further deterioration of his mental health. Mr. Allen has suffered and continues to suffer \n6  irreparable harm and lacks an adequate remedy at law. \n7  182.  Accordingly, he is entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent \n8  future violations. Plaintiff is also entitled to compensatory damages for the harm he has \n9  endured, attorneys’ fees, and costs. \n10  TWELFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nCalifornia Government Code Section 835 \n11 \nAgainst Defendant City of San Diego \n12   \n183.      Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in \n13 \nthe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n14 \n184.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  each  and  every  allegation  in  the \n15 \npreceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n16 \n185.  Plaintiffs bring this cause of action under California Gov. Code §835. \n17 \n186.  Defendants  are  liable  for  Plaintiffs’  losses  and  injuries  caused  by  a \n18 \ndangerous condition of public property. The “Safe Sleeping Program” encampments, \n19 \n“Lot B” and “Lot O”, located on public lots operated by the City of San Diego, were \n20 \nin a dangerous condition at the time of the injuries, and this dangerous condition created \n21 \na reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of harm that Plaintiffs ultimately suffered. \n22 \nThese dangerous conditions and risks continue to exist due to Defendant’s actions and \n23 \ninactions. \n24 \n/// \n25 \n/// \n26 \n/// \n27 \n/// \n28 \n \n- 41 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.42     Page 42 of\n49\n \n1  187.  Further, Defendants created and/or had actual and/or constructive notice \n2  of the dangerous conditions a sufficient time prior to the injuries to have taken measures \n3  to protect against those conditions. \n4  188.  Defendants controlled and managed the “Safe Sleeping Program” at all \n5  relevant times, including its overall operation, maintenance, and continued use as \n6  designated Camp locations for unhoused individuals. \n7  189.  The Defendants own, operate, and are responsible for maintaining the \n8  City-owned lots used for the Safe Sleeping Program, including the tents, walkways, \n9  common areas, and any structural elements or onsite facilities. \n10  190.   These City-owned lots were and continue to be in a poor and unsafe \n11  condition during the relevant period because Defendants failed to implement adequate \n12  pest control measures (leading to rodent infestation), failed to provide safe sanitation \n13  facilities, address extreme temperatures and weather hazards such as heat, cold, and \n14  flooding), and failed to improve dangerous and inaccessible terrain or remedy other \n15  known hazards. \n16  191. The sites are also subject to harsh environmental conditions—including \n17  excessive heat and flooding—that Defendants have neglected to mitigate. For example, \n18 \ntents lack sufficient shade in the summer and are prone to flooding in the winter, \n19 \ncompounding the danger and creating a heightened risk of illness or injury. \n20 \n192.  The  conditions  of  Defendants’  “Safe  Sleeping  Program”  constitute \n21 \ndangerous hazards that posed, and continue to pose, unreasonable risks of harm to \n22 \nPlaintiffs and other residents forced to remain on-site with no alternative housing or \n23 \nshelter. \n24 \n193.  These risks resulted from Defendants’ failure to: \n25 \n•  Provide or maintain adequate pest control and rodent abatement, \n26 \n•  Ensure  sufficient  and  consistently  sanitary  restroom,  washing,  and \n27 \nhygiene facilities, \n28 \n•  Offer protection from extreme heat cold, and hazardous weather, \n \n- 42 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.43     Page 43 of\n49\n \n1  •  Allocate adequate resources to keep the Property free from vermin and \n2  other health hazards, and \n3  •  Take mitigating measures to prevent fire from breaking out and control \n4  its spread;  \n5  •  Promptly  remedy  the  overcrowding  and  unsanitary  conditions  that \n6 \nexacerbated these dangers. \n7 \n194.  The  City’s  poor  maintenance  and  lack  of  proper  oversight  of  the \n8 \nProperties created a clear and foreseeable risk of harm to Plaintiffs. With no effective \n9 \nmeans  to  address  infestations,  temperature  extremes,  or  lack  of  sanitation,  the \n10 \nProperties  remained  in  a  condition  that  could—and  did—lead  to  physical  and \n11 \nemotional harm and continues to do so. \n12 \n195.  Defendants are, and were, at all relevant times aware of these dangerous \n13 \nconditions, as evidenced by complaints from Plaintiffs and other residents for months \n14 \n(if not longer) before this lawsuit. Despite acknowledging the need to address rodent \n15 \ninfestations, unsafe spacing of tents, unsanitary restrooms, and exposure to harsh \n16 \nweather,  Defendants  failed  to  timely  and  meaningfully  remedy  the  situations. \n17 \nSpecifically, Defendants neglected to: \n18 \n•  Implement timely and effective pest control services, \n19 \n•  Ensure adequate sanitation facilities, \n20 \n•  Provide reliable solutions or resources to mitigate extreme heat and \n21 \nflood risks, \n22 \n•  Provide reliable solutions or resources to mitigate risk of fire and ensure \n23 \nfire safety for residents,  \n24 \n•  Enforce health and safety standards applicable to the Property, \n25 \n•  Supply the necessary funding for sustained improvements, and \n26 \n•  Establish or follow through with any long-term strategy to correct the \n27 \nunsafe conditions. \n28 \n \n- 43 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.44     Page 44 of\n49\n \n1  196.  These failures collectively contributed to the dangerous conditions for \n2  residents in the Safe Sleeping Program. \n3  197.  Defendant City of San Diego was aware, or should have been aware, that \n4  these conditions posed a significant risk of harm to Plaintiffs and others compelled to \n5  reside there. By failing to act on that knowledge, Defendants proximately caused \n6  Plaintiffs’ injuries arising from the dangerous condition of their property. \n7  THIRTEENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nNUISANCE \n8 \nAgainst All Defendants \n9   \n198.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation contained in \n10 \nThe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n11 \n199.  Plaintiffs bring this claim pursuant to Civ. Code §3480 (Public Nuisance). \n12 \n200.   Defendants’ conduct caused the harm suffered by Plaintiffs by creating, \n13 \nmaintaining, or failing to abate unsafe conditions in the City-operated “Safe Sleeping \n14 \nProgram” encampments, thereby interfering with Plaintiffs’ health, safety, and right to \n15 \nthe comfortable enjoyment of life. \n16 \n201.  The interference was substantial and unreasonable, and caused severe \n17 \ninconvenience  and  harm  to  Plaintiffs  and  others  similarly  situated.  Any  ordinary \n18 \nreasonable person facing rodent infestations, unsanitary facilities, and exposure to \n19 \nextreme weather conditions would find such interference offensive and intolerable. \n20 \n202.   Defendants’ conduct caused this interference by failing to maintain safe \n21 \nand habitable sleeping areas, neglecting adequate pest control, and not remedying \n22 \nexcessive heat. Cold, flooding or fire risks—all of which substantially interfered with \n23 \nPlaintiffs’ ability to live safely at the encampments. \n24 \n203.  Plaintiffs did not consent, nor did they ever consent, to being subjected to \n25 \nunsafe, unsanitary, and overcrowded conditions in the City-owned lots. \n26 \n/// \n27 \n/// \n28 \n \n- 44 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.45     Page 45 of\n49\n \n1  204.  Defendants  knew  or  should  have  known  that  failing  to  remedy  the \n2  conditions described herein—such as rodent infestation and inadequate sanitation—\n3  would likely result in harm to Plaintiffs and other residents. \n4  205.  Defendants’ actions and/or failures to act were unreasonable and directly \n5  caused the harm suffered by Plaintiffs, thus constituting a public nuisance. \n6  FOURTEENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nNEGLIGENCE \n7 \nAgainst All Defendants \n8   \n206.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate each and every allegation set forth in \n9 \nthe preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  \n10 \n207.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  cause  of  action  based  on  Defendants’  negligent \n11 \nconduct in establishing and operating the “Safe Sleeping Program” encampments on \n12 \nCity-owned property. \n13 \n208.  Defendants owed Plaintiffs a duty of reasonable care. By operating and \n14 \npromoting the Safe Sleeping Program, the City undertook responsibility for providing \n15 \nat least minimally safe conditions for unhoused individuals, including basic protection \n16 \nfrom foreseeable hazards, adequate sanitation, pest control, and weather-related safety \n17 \nmeasures.  Having  encouraged  or  required  Plaintiffs  to  reside  on  City  property, \n18 \nDefendants  assumed  the  obligation  to  exercise  reasonable  care  in  managing  and \n19 \nmaintaining that location. \n20 \n209.  Defendants breached their duty by failing to provide and maintain safe, \n21 \nsanitary, and suitable living conditions. Specifically, Defendants: \n22 \n•  Neglected to implement effective pest control measures, resulting in \n23 \nsevere rodent infestation; \n24 \n•  Failed to maintain adequate restroom and hygiene facilities, exposing \n25 \nresidents to unsanitary conditions; \n26 \n \n27 \n28 \n \n- 45 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.46     Page 46 of\n49\n \n1  •  Did not address known weather hazards—extreme heat in the summer, \n2  cold and flooding in the winter—thereby leaving Plaintiffs vulnerable to \n3  heatstroke, cold exposure, and other weather-related injuries; \n4  •  Overcrowded the tents, placed them too close together, and did not \n5  provide adequate spacing, risking the rapid spread of infestation, illness, \n6  fire, or other harms; and \n7  •  Ignored or inadequately responded to repeated complaints about unsafe \n8  conditions, despite having the authority and resources to address or mitigate \n9  them. \n10  210.  Defendants’ breach of their duties proximately caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. \n11  Plaintiffs suffered (and continue to suffer) harm to their health and well-being due to \n12  rodent  bites  and  droppings,  potential  water  contamination,  exposure  to  extreme \n13  weather, inadequate sanitation, and stress arising from overcrowded conditions and \n14  unaddressed hazards. But for Defendants’ negligent maintenance and oversight of the \n15  Safe Sleeping Program property, Plaintiffs would not have experienced these injuries, \n16  or at a minimum, the risk of injury would have been significantly reduced. \n17  211.  As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendants’ negligence, Plaintiffs \n18 \nsustained physical injuries (including exposure to vermin-borne illnesses), emotional \n19 \ndistress, pain and suffering, and other harms associated with enduring these unsafe, \n20 \nsubstandard living conditions. Plaintiffs also suffered the loss of personal property due \n21 \nto flooding or contamination, further compounding the harm caused by Defendants’ \n22 \nnegligent acts and omissions. \n23 \n212.  By failing to use reasonable care to keep City-controlled sleeping sites \n24 \nsafe and by failing to timely respond to known dangerous conditions, Defendants’ \n25 \nnegligence  directly  caused  Plaintiffs’  injuries.  Consequently,  Plaintiffs  seek  all \n26 \nappropriate  damages,  including  compensatory  damages  for  physical,  mental,  and \n27 \nemotional harm, in an amount according to proof at trial. \n28 \n/// \n \n- 46 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY, & MONETARY RELIEF  \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02186-AGS-MMP     Document 1     Filed 08/25/25     PageID.47     Page 47 of\n49\n \n1  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n2  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask that the Court:  \n3  1) Declare that the Defendants’ actions and omissions alleged herein are violations \n4  of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3604 et seq.; substantive and procedural due \n5  process under the 14th Amendment, 42 U.S.C. §1983; Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \n6  §12132; Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12182; California Fair Employment and \n7  Housing Act, California Government Code §12955; the Unruh Act, Civil Code §51 et \n8  seq.;  the  Unfair  Business  Practices  Act,  California  Business  &  Professions  Code \n9  §§17200 et seq.; California Government Code §11135; and/or California Government \n10  Code §835;   \n11  2) Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §3613, 42 \n12  U.S.C. §12133, 29 U.S.C. §794(a); 42 U.S.C. §1983; 42 U.S.C. §12188; Ca.
