The Trump Administration justified this placement by claiming that the schools were in violation of Title IX by maintaining a policy that permitted students to access restrooms and locker rooms that aligned with their gender identity. Plaintiff &ndash; the Fairfax County School Board &ndash; filed this suit &nbsp;in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Aug. 29, 2025. Plaintiff simultaneously sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, vacating the federal &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; designation and paying all funds previously denied. The case was assigned to Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr.</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 2025, following weeks of motion practice, the court denied Plaintiffs Motions for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Judge Alston Jr. t reasoned that Plaintiffs explicitly requested money damages, and framed monetary damages in injunctive or declaratory claims, which, under the Tucker Act, does not allow Article III jurisdiction. In that order, the court also dismissed the complaints without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 9, Plaintiffs appealed the denial of the Temporary Restraining Order and the Preliminary Injunction, and the dismissal. On September 15, 2025, Plaintiffs, now Appellants, filed an Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal. In this Emergency Motion, Plaintiffs argued that the District Court does have Article III Jurisdiction because a claim for funds improperly denied under Title IX is considered &ldquo;relief other than money damages.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

VIII, § 1 ........................................................................... 26 \niv \n\n \nINTRODUCTION1 \nDefendants demand that Plaintiff Fairfax County School Board, \nwhich operates Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS), violate binding \nFourth  Circuit  law  interpreting  Title  IX—law  that  this  Court  has \nconsistently  reaffirmed,  including  as  recently  as  a  few  weeks  ago.  \nBecause FCPS has refused to follow Defendants’ unlawful directive to \nrestrict students’ access to facilities based on the sex assigned them at \nbirth,  Defendants  have  illegally  and  improperly  designated  FCPS  as \n“high-risk” for purposes of receiving funds appropriated by Congress.  \nDefendants  demand  that  FCPS  violate  Title  IX  as  a  non-negotiable, \noverarching condition on the continued receipt of those funds.  Their \naction  in  imposing  the  “high-risk”  status  designation  is  illegal  and \nunreasonable,  and  jeopardizes  millions  of  dollars  that  provide  vital \nservices to tens of thousands of FCPS students. \nFCPS sought declaratory and injunctive relief from those orders in \nthe Eastern District of Virginia.  But because one result of that relief \nwould  restore  FCPS’s  access  to  funds,  the  district  court—relying  on \n \n1 Defendants’ counsel have been notified that FCPS is filing this motion.  \nDefendants’ counsel indicated that Defendants oppose this motion and \nintend to file a response.  See 4th Cir. R. 27(a).   \n1 \n\n \nunclear  and  inapposite  emergency-docket  guidance  from  a  fractured \nSupreme Court and on a decision of this Court relying on that guidance—\nruled  that  FCPS’s  claims  lay  within  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  the \nCourt  of  Federal  Claims.    It  denied  relief  and  dismissed  FCPS’s \ncomplaint.  \nThat was error.  Under Title IX’s express terms, Article III courts \nhave jurisdiction of this dispute.  First, Congress expressly made Title IX \nfunding challenges subject to judicial review under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (APA)—i.e., review by an Article III court.  Second, the \nAPA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not extend to money damages.  \nTherefore, under basic rules of statutory construction, claims asserting \nthat funding has been improperly withheld under Title IX because of an \narbitrary status designation by Defendants are not claims for “money \ndamages”—and  thus  do  not  fall  within  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims’ \nnarrow jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court’s emergency-docket orders do \nnot  involve  the  judicial-review  provision  of  Title  IX  and  have  no \napplication  here,  where  Congress  has  plainly  defined  the  courts’ \njurisdiction. \n2 \n\n \nThe district court’s dismissal of FCPS’s motion effectively gives \nFCPS no remedy at law to protect against an arbitrary and capricious \ndenial of federal funds.  FCPS sued in the district court to prevent the \ndevastating consequences of those funds’ unavailability because of the \n“high-risk” designation.  Absent this Court’s intervention, the district \ncourt’s erroneous ruling will leave FCPS with no cognizable claim for the \nirreparable harm that will ensue from Defendants’ action.  \nOn  the  merits,  FCPS  demonstrated  below  that  a  preliminary \ninjunction should issue.  FCPS is likely to succeed on the merits of its \nclaims because this Court’s interpretation of Title IX binds them.  FCPS \nwill likely suffer irreparable harm by being unable to provide crucial \nservices to students absent the funding Defendants seek to withhold.  \nBoth the public interest and the balance of equities favor FCPS, which \nhas  a  duty  under  Commonwealth  law  to  provide  a  free  and \ncomprehensive education.  Defendants have no protectable interest in \nforcing FCPS to violate federal law to do so. \nFCPS  respectfully  requests  that  the  Court  reverse  the  district \ncourt’s  erroneous  jurisdictional  ruling;  enjoin  Defendants  from  mis-\ndesignating FCPS as “high-risk”; and remand to the district court. \n3 \n\n \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Factual background \nThe  parties.    FCPS  is  a  northern  Virginia  school  division \nresponsible  for  providing  education  in  Fairfax  County  and  the \nindependent  city  of  Fairfax.    R.1  ¶ 10.2    Defendant-Appellee  Linda \nMcMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education, head of Defendant-Appellee \nthe U.S. Department of Education.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 12. \nGrimm and FCPS policy.  In Grimm v. Gloucester County School \nBoard, 972 F.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020), this Court held that both the Equal \nProtection Clause and Title IX compel access to facilities that correspond \nwith students’ gender identities.  Accordingly, FCPS’s facilities-access \npolicy allows transgender students to use the sex-segregated facilities—\nincluding  locker  rooms  and  restrooms—that  correspond  with  their \ngender identities.  See Fairfax Cnty. Pub. Schs. Reg. 2603.2 (FCPS R.1 \n¶ 40 et seq.). \nVirginia’s model policies also acknowledge Grimm’s binding federal \nrequirements.  See https://tinyurl.com/25upya54. \n \n2 Citations to “R.” are to the record in 25-cv-01432. \n4 \n\n \nThe Department of Education’s pretextual “investigation.”  \nOn February 12, 2025, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil \nRights (“OCR”) issued a notification letter to FCPS, along with four other \nnorthern Virginia school divisions, asserting that a complaint had been \nfiled  alleging  that  FCPS  violated  Title  IX  by  providing  transgender \nstudents with access to sex-segregated facilities based on their gender \nidentities.  R.1 ¶¶ 41, 44.  This complaint was originally generated by \nAmerica First Legal, an outside organization that has brought Title IX \ncomplaints  against  school  districts  and  universities  to  interfere  with \ntransgender individuals’ access to facilities and athletics programs.  See \nid. ¶ 42.  FCPS’s response to the OCR inquiry cited both Grimm and the \nVirginia model policies as the bases for its policy.  Id. ¶ 43. \nOCR’s investigation was not a good-faith attempt to enforce the law \nbut a pretextual ploy to subvert it.  Cf. Pres. & Fellows of Harvard Coll. v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, — F. Supp. 3d —, 2025 WL 2528380, at *25 (D. \nMass.  Sept.  3,  2025)  (“the  government-initiated  onslaught  against \nHarvard was much more about promoting a governmental orthodoxy in \nviolation of the First Amendment than about anything else, including \nfighting  antisemitism”).    On  July  25,  OCR  issued  a  Findings  Letter \n5 \n\n \nasserting that FCPS’s policy violates Title IX.  R.1 ¶ 44.  Attached to the \nFindings  Letter  was  a  draft  Resolution  Agreement,  demanding  that \nFCPS alter its policy to conform to OCR’s erroneous interpretation of \nTitle IX, which requires treating all individuals exclusively according to \nthe sex assigned them at birth.  Id.  OCR imposed an August 15 deadline \nfor compliance.  Id. at ¶ 46. \nOn  August  15,  this  Court  issued  its  opinion  in  Doe  v.  South \nCarolina, in which it repeatedly and succinctly reaffirmed that Grimm \nremains the law of this Circuit.  2025 WL 2375386, *8 (4th Cir. Aug. 15, \n2025).  That same day, FCPS again told Defendants that it was bound by \nGrimm and could not lawfully modify its policy as OCR demands.  R.1 \n¶ 47.    On  the  following  Monday,  FCPS  filed  a  supplemental  letter \nbringing Doe to Defendants’ attention.  Id. at ¶ 48. \nThe “high-risk” designation.  On August 19, despite the clear \nauthority in Grimm, Defendants issued a letter designating FCPS as a \n“high-risk” entity under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.208 and 3474.10, asserting that \nFCPS’s compliance with this Court’s binding interpretation was instead \n“noncompliance with Title IX.”  R.1-3. \n6 \n\n \nIn this letter, Defendants imposed “specific conditions on [FCPS’s] \nuse of funds in all grants it receives from the Department.”  Id.  Among \nother requirements, Defendants demanded that FCPS “submit plans for \ncompliance with all federal laws” and “submit a corrective action plan … \nthat shows all steps taken to be in compliance with the applicable laws.”  \nId. at 3–4.  They also required FCPS to “provide detailed information that \nidentifies and discusses the steps [FCPS] will take to ensure that grant \nfunds will be spent in accordance with all appliable [sic] laws.”  Id. \nFCPS’s federal grants were “placed on a reimbursement method of \npayment,”  conditioning  payment  on  FCPS’s  “adherence  to  [the \nDepartment’s interpretation of] all pertinent federal civil rights laws that \napply to your division’s grants and subgrants.”  Id.  In effect, the “high-\nrisk” designation letter requires that FCPS restrict students’ facilities \naccess to the sex assigned them at birth—a policy change that would \ndirectly violate Grimm. \nB.  Procedural background \nOn  August  29,  2025,  FCPS  and  the  Arlington  School  Board \n(together with FCPS, the “School Districts”) filed separate complaints \nasserting claims for relief under the APA, the Declaratory Judgment Act, \n7 \n\n \nand the U.S. Constitution.  See generally R.1.  The primary relief the \nSchool  Districts  sought  was  (1) a  declaratory  judgment  stating  that \nGrimm  binds  them,  and  (2) a  prospective  injunction  requiring  that \nDefendants de-designate the School Districts from “high-risk” status and \nremove the reimbursement-only bar to their use of funds.  Id.  The School \nDistricts also sought preliminary injunctions.  See R.2. \nOn September 5, the district court issued an order denying the \nSchool Districts’ motions and dismissing the School Districts’ complaints \nfor a lack of jurisdiction.  R.28 at 12.  Purporting to follow Supreme Court \nemergency-docket guidance, the district court concluded that the School \nDistricts’ equitable claims were disguised claims for “money damages” \nand thus subject to the Court of Federal Claims’ exclusive jurisdiction.  \nR.28  at  4–11.    The  district  court  nevertheless  “unconditionally \nrecognize[d] that Grimm ‘remains the law of this Circuit.’”  R.28 at 4. \nFCPS timely appealed.  R.30. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nAlthough a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, its \naward is justified where a party shows that it is likely to succeed on the \nunderlying merits, that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm absent an \n8 \n\n \ninjunction, that the balance of equities tips in the party’s favor, and that \nan  injunction  is  within  the  public  interest.    Winter  v.  Nat.  Res.  Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Certainty of either an irreparable \ninjury or of success on the merits is not required; only a likelihood.  Id. at \n22. \nARGUMENT \nI.  FCPS’s  claims  lie  exclusively  within  Article  III  courts’ \njurisdiction. \nTitle IX contains a judicial-review provision that incorporates the \nAPA, and thus relies on the Article III courts and the APA’s waiver of \nsovereign immunity.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1683; R.27 at 6, 8, 10.  The district \ncourt nevertheless concluded that “here the action is subject to judicial \nreview  in  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims,”  and  on  that  basis  rejected \n“Plaintiffs’ reliance on 20 U.S.C. § 1683.”  R.28 at 8.  This question-\nbegging conclusion ignores Title IX’s explicit provision of an APA cause \nof action for claims of improper denial of funds due to the government’s \nmisinterpretation of Title IX.  The district court’s jurisdictional ruling is \nerror. \n9 \n\n \nA.  The  Court  of  Federal  Claims’  jurisdiction  does  not \nextend to APA claims, which § 1683 expressly allows. \nThe answer to whether jurisdiction of this case lies in Article III \ncourts is on the face of the relevant statutes.  The Court of Federal \nClaims’  “jurisdiction  is  statutorily  granted  and  is  to  be  strictly \nconstrued.”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 908 n.46 (1988).  “The \njurisdiction  of  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims  under  the  Tucker  Act  is \n‘limited to actual, presently due money damages from the United States.’”  \nTodd v. United States, 386 F.3d 1091, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting \nUnited States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 398 (1976)).  As a result, the Court \nof  Federal  Claims  lacks  jurisdiction  over  APA  claims  because  those \nclaims cannot be claims for money damages.  5 U.S.C. § 702. \nThe  Supreme  Court  recently  recognized  that  “[t]he  Tucker  Act \nyields  when  the  obligation-creating  statute  provides  its  own  detailed \nremedies,  or  when  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act …  provides  an \navenue for relief.”  Me. Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. \n296, 323–24 (2020) (emphasis added).  That holding did not condition the \nTucker Act yielding only where the APA provides the exclusive avenue for \nrelief.  Having the APA as an avenue for relief suffices. \n10 \n\n \nHere, Congress has expressly stated that the APA “provides an \navenue  for  relief.”    See  id.;  20  U.S.C.  § 1683  (“any  person  aggrieved \n(including any State or political subdivision thereof and any agency of \neither)  may  obtain  judicial  review  of  such  action  in  accordance  with \nchapter 7 of title 5”); Tenn. v. Dep’t of Educ., 104 F.4th 577, 604 (6th Cir. \n2024) (“The second sentence of § 1683 [] … provides one avenue to judicial \nreview[.]”)  (emphasis  added).    Accordingly,  per  the  Supreme  Court’s \nrecent  precedent,  the  “Tucker  Act  yields”  and  the  district  court  has \njurisdiction of these claims.  Me. Cmty., 590 U.S. at 323–24.  \nHere, moreover, FCPS’s claims are not for “actual, presently due \nmoney damages,” Todd, 386 F.3d at 1093, but for the district court to \nprospectively require that Defendants not arbitrarily designate FCPS \n“high-risk”  and  condition  the  disbursement  of  funds  on  Defendants’ \nerroneous understanding of Title IX.  This litigation seeks to prevent \nimminent harm, not undo past harm by awarding money damages.  The \ndistrict court’s flawed jurisdictional ruling leaves FCPS with no legal \npath to prevent an unlawful outcome—a result that Congress plainly \nsought to avoid in promulgating Title IX’s judicial-review provision. \n11 \n\n \nB.  Congress  identified  claims  for  funds  improperly \ndenied  under  Title  IX  as  “relief  other  than  money \ndamages.”  \nCongress  sets  the  jurisdiction  of  all  federal  courts  below  the \nSupreme Court.  See U.S. CONST. art. III, § 1; Palmore v. United States, \n411  U.S.  389,  401  (1973)  (“the  task  of  defining  [inferior  courts’] \njurisdiction[]  was  left  to  the  discretion  of  Congress”).    And  only \nCongress—not  the  Courts—may  waive  the  United  States’  sovereign \nimmunity.  Dep’t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. Serv. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. \n42, 48 (2024) (“the power to waive the federal government’s immunity is \nCongress’s prerogative, not” the Judiciary’s). \nA “statute is to be read as a whole, … since the meaning of statutory \nlanguage, plain or not, depends on context.”  King v. St. Vincent’s Hosp., \n502  U.S.  215,  221  (1991).    Indeed,  “the  first  rule  of …  statutory \ninterpretation is: Read on.”  Ark. Game & Fish Comm’n v. United States, \n568 U.S. 23, 36 (2012).  Here, the district court read “not otherwise \nsubject to judicial review” in 20 U.S.C. § 1683 and stopped reading—\nignoring the context in which that language appeared. \nCongress has explicitly provided that the APA is an appropriate \nmechanism for judicial review of agency actions terminating or refusing \n12 \n\n \nto grant or continue funding based on an agency determination “of a \nfailure to comply” with the requirements of Title IX or its implementing \nregulations: \nAny  department  or  agency  action  taken  pursuant  to \nsection 1682 of this title shall be subject to such judicial \nreview as may otherwise be provided by law for similar \naction  taken  by  such  department  or  agency  on  other \ngrounds.  In the case of action, not otherwise subject to \njudicial  review,  terminating  or  refusing  to  grant  or  to \ncontinue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to \ncomply with any requirement imposed pursuant to section \n1682  of  this  title,  any  person  aggrieved  (including  any \nState or political subdivision thereof and any agency of \neither)  may  obtain  judicial  review  of  such  action  in \naccordance with chapter 7 of title 5, and such action shall \nnot  be  deemed  committed  to  unreviewable  agency \ndiscretion within the meaning of section 701 of that title. \n20 U.S.C. § 1683.   \nThe  first  sentence  of  § 1683  mandates  that  specific  statutory \nschemes for review of particular agencies’ actions are a litigant’s first \nstop.  “For example, some courts interpreting an identical judicial review \nprovision in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 say that the phrase \n‘as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action’ can refer to 20 \nU.S.C. § 1234g.”  Tennessee, 104 F.4th at 604–05; see Freeman v. Cavazos, \n923  F.2d  1434,  1440  (11th  Cir.  1991)  (holding  that  § 1234g,  which \nchannels  judicial  review  directly  into  the  Courts  of  Appeals,  is  “the \n13 \n\n \nappropriate  judicial  review  provision[]  for  the  termination  order  in” \ncertain ALJ proceedings).  That is the context in which § 1683 speaks of \n“action[s] not otherwise subject to judicial review.”  It is not a clandestine \ndiversion of Article III courts’ jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims; \nit points instead to the narrow, agency- and circumstance-specific Article \nIII  challenges  to  administrative  decisions  referenced  in  the  previous \nsentence. \nFor the rest of agency actions “terminating or refusing to grant or \nto continue financial assistance,” Title IX directs “judicial review” under \nthe APA.  Because there is no “unmistakably clear” language indicating \na  separate  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity  in  § 1683,  the  proper \ninterpretation is that Congress intended those challenges to make use of \nthe APA’s waiver.  See Kirtz, 601 U.S. at 49.   \nThe APA waives the United States’ sovereign immunity only with \nrespect to “[a]n action in a court of the United States seeking relief other \nthan money damages.”  5 U.S.C. § 702 (emphasis added).  Had Congress \nmeant to treat Title IX funding claims as claims for money damages that \nwere nevertheless subject to the APA’s waiver of immunity, it would have \n14 \n\n \ndone so expressly—in much the same way as § 1683 expressly directs a \nparticular finding under a different section of the APA, § 701. \nIt follows, therefore, that an APA claim challenging an “action … \nterminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance” is, in \nCongress’s view, not a claim for money damages.  See Lipsett v. Univ. of \nP.R., 864 F.2d 881, 885 n.6 (1st Cir. 1988) (“there is in Title IX … no \nexpress congressional authorization of private damages actions”).  It is, \ninstead, what FCPS said it is:  a claim for prospective injunctive relief \nunder the APA.   \nBecause FCPS’s claims are not for money damages either in fact or \nin Congress’s binding view, they  are not within the Court of Federal \nClaims’ jurisdiction, and thus “not otherwise subject to judicial review” \nthere.  See § 1683.  Those claims lie instead within the jurisdiction of \n“court[s] of the United States” empowered to review agency actions under \n5 U.S.C. § 702—including the district court.  Tennessee, 104 F.4th at 604 \n(“The  second  sentence  of  § 1683 …  says  that  after  an  administrative \nenforcement proceeding strips the recipient of its funding, the recipient \ncan sue under the APA.”); Maine v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 778 F. Supp. 3d \n200, 226–27 (D. Me. 2025) (enjoining “freezing … funds” under Title IX:  \n15 \n\n \n“Consistent with the plain language of 20 U.S.C. § 1683 … the Court \nagrees with the Plaintiff that it has jurisdiction to review the disputed \nagency action”). \nThe district court’s contrary conclusion requires either reading the \nexpress cross-reference to the APA in § 1683 as meaningless surplusage \nor—even  less  permissibly—expanding  the  APA’s  waiver  of  sovereign \nimmunity to incorporate claims for money damages.  See, e.g., Freeman v. \nQuicken  Loans,  Inc.,  566  U.S.  624,  635  (2012)  (explaining  the  canon \nagainst  surplusage);  Kirtz,  601  U.S.  at  48  (courts  have  no  power  to \nexpand Congress’s waivers of sovereign immunity).  Because the district \ncourt’s jurisdictional analysis was error, reversal is required. \nC.  The U.S. Supreme Court’s emergency-docket decisions \nare  not  relevant  where  Congress  has  expressly \nassigned jurisdiction. \nPlain statutory language answers the jurisdictional question, and \nCongress—not the Supreme Court—is the master of the inferior courts’ \njurisdiction.    Thus,  the  Supreme  Court’s  opaque  and  contradictory \nemergency-docket decisions shunting certain federal-funding cases into \nthe Court of Federal Claims—and this Court’s decision in Sustainability \nInstitute v. Trump, 2025 WL 1587100 (4th Cir. June 5, 2025), relying on \n16 \n\n \nthose cases—are simply beside the point.  The cases on which the district \ncourt relies (see R.28 at 4–8), do not involve § 1683 or similarly binding \njurisdictional provisions.  Accordingly, those cases are inapposite and do \nnot justify abandoning the clear jurisdictional authority that governs \nTitle IX cases.  See, e.g., Maine, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 226–27 (rejecting \njurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims because § 1683 “makes clear \nthat any person aggrieved by an agency action terminating … funding \nupon a finding of Title IX noncompliance” may obtain APA review). \nII.  FCPS satisfies the injunction factors. \nAn injunction is appropriate here because FCPS satisfied the four \ntraditional injunction elements. See Tandon v. Newsom, 593 U.S. 61, 64 \n(2021).  FCPS sought injunctive relief below.  See generally R.1.  The \ndistrict court improperly denied the motion.   \nA.  FCPS is likely to succeed on the merits. \nFCPS claimed (1) that the Defendants’ actions should be set aside \nunder the APA; and (2) that declaratory judgment is warranted because \nFCPS’s facilities-access policy comports with Grimm.  A likelihood of \nsuccess  on  any  claim  suffices  for  injunctive  relief.    See  Salomon  & \nLudwin, LLC v. Winters, No. 24-1728, 2025 WL 2314652, at *3 n.1 (4th \nCir. Aug. 12, 2025). \n17 \n\n \n1.  FCPS’s APA claims are likely to succeed. \na.  Defendants’ actions are reviewable final agency actions.  \n“[A]gency action includes the whole or part of an agency rule, order, \nlicense, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to \nact.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13) (internal quotations omitted).  An action is “final” \nwhen (1) it “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking \nprocess”  and  (2) is  “one  by  which  rights  or  obligations  have  been \ndetermined  or  from  which  legal  consequences  will  flow.”    Bennett  v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (cleaned up).  Finality for the purpose \nof  judicial  review  “entails  a  ‘pragmatic’  and  ‘flexible’  inquiry.”    Nat’l \nCouncil of Agric. Emps. v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 143 F.4th 395, 410 (D.C. \nCir. 2025). \nHere,  Defendants’  “high-risk”  designation  of  FCPS  (R.1-3),  is \n“not … of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature” but reflects the \nconclusion of Defendants’ decision-making process concerning specific \nconditions imposed on FCPS.  See id.  Moreover, Defendants’ actions \n“determined”  “rights  or  obligations,”  Bennett,  520  U.S.  at  177–78, \nbecause those actions “ha[d] an immediate and practical impact,” Frozen \nFood Express v. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 43–44 (1956), requiring FCPS \n18 \n\n \nto rescind its policy in violation of federal law or lose access to federal \nfunds  Congress  has  appropriated.    As  this  Court  has  explained  in \nassessing ripeness, “impos[ing] new conditions” even absent a “formal \nadministrative order” is a final agency action.  Arch Mineral Corp. v. \nBabbitt,  104  F.3d  660,  667  (4th  Cir.  1997).    Here,  Defendants  have \nimposed those conditions through a formal administrative order.  \nb.  Defendants’ actions are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, and contrary to law.  Defendants’ actions reflect a clearly \nerroneous  interpretation  of  binding  law.    As  even  the  district  court \n“unconditionally recognize[d,] … Grimm remains the law of this Circuit \nand thus binds … parties within the Fourth Circuit.”  R.28 at 4 (cleaned \nup).  As a result, the Defendants’ actions against FCPS for its policy are \narbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  and  contrary  to  law.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n“The APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency \naction be reasonable and reasonably explained.”  FCC v. Prometheus \nRadio  Project,  592  U.S.  414,  423  (2021).    Defendants’  “high-risk” \ndesignation was neither.  Defendants demand that FCPS adhere to their \ninterpretation of Title IX.  But FCPS is bound by this Court’s holding that \n19 \n\n \nTitle IX does not forbid policies like FCPS’s but requires them.  Grimm, \n972 F.3d at 619–20. \nIn addition, Defendants’ actions have singled out FCPS and four \nother Northern Virginia school districts based on their policies, despite \nthe fact that other similarly situated school districts in Virginia have \npolicies like the one at issue here.  This unreasoned disparate treatment \nis by its nature arbitrary.  Kirk v. Comm’r of SSA, 987 F.3d 314, 321 (4th \nCir. 2021) (“Where an agency applies different standards to similarly \nsituated entities and fails to support this disparate treatment with a \nreasoned explanation and substantial evidence in the record, its action is \narbitrary and capricious and cannot be upheld.”) (cleaned up).   \nFurther,  Defendants  plainly  “misapprehen[ded]  …  the  baseline \nconditions existing” in the Fourth Circuit “in advance of [their] action.”  \nFriends of Back Bay v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 681 F.3d 581, 588 (4th \nCir. 2012).  An agency abuses its discretion when its “decision is based on \nan improper understanding of the law.”  Pappas v. FCC, 807 F.2d 1019, \n1023 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (cleaned up).  Those baseline conditions and the law \nincluded Grimm.  R.1 ¶ 111.    \n20 \n\n \nAnd, of course, Defendants’ demand that FCPS obey their policy \ndemands and not this Court is contrary to law.  “It is emphatically the \nprovince and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”  \nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis added).  \nWhat Defendants demand here is abrogation of the law, not its “faithful[] \nexecut[ion],”  see  U.S.  CONST.  art.  II,  § 3—and  their  actions  are  thus \ncontrary to that foundational principle. \nBecause  Defendants’  actions  were  arbitrary  and  capricious,  an \nabuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, FCPS is likely to \nsucceed on their APA claims.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nc.  Defendants’ actions are contrary to constitutional right \nor power.  Courts must also set aside agency actions that are “contrary \nto  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity.”    5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(B).  “[T]he Federal Government may not compel the States to \nenact or administer a federal regulatory program.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \nBus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 575 (2012) (cleaned up).  Congress may, \nas an exercise of its authority under the Spending Clause, U.S. CONST. \nart. I, § 8, cl. 1, condition the receipt of federal funds on states’ “taking \ncertain actions that Congress could not require them to take,” Sebelius, \n21 \n\n \n567 U.S. at 576.  Nevertheless, Congress may not, consistent with that \nauthority,  “commandeer[] a  State’s  legislative  or  administrative \napparatus for federal purposes.”  Id. at 577. \nAnd of course if Congress may not pass laws that “commandeer[] a \nState’s legislative or administrative apparatus,” the Executive may not \nexecute Congress’s laws in such a fashion.  Id.  When executing federal \nlaws, what is ultra vires Congress is similarly ultra vires the President, \nand allowing the Executive to act beyond its authority invades powers \nretained by the States and the people.  U.S. CONST. amend. X. \nHere,  Defendants  are  engaged  in exactly  the  kind  of  “economic \ndragooning” the Supreme Court has forbidden, leaving FCPS and other \nVirginia schools “with no real option but to acquiesce” in Defendants’ \nregulatory interpretation of Title IX.  See Sebelius, 567 U.S. at 582 (2012).  \nBy effectively cutting off future access to federal funding, Defendants \nseek not to “mild[ly] encourage[],” S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 \n(1987), but to compel those divisions to “administer” the Defendants’ \nregulatory  program  barring  transgender  individuals  from  accessing \nfacilities that correspond with their gender identities, see New York v. \nUnited States, 505 U.S. 144, 188 (1992). \n22 \n\n \nBecause that attempted coercion is contrary to Virginia’s and its \npeople’s  reserved  constitutional  power  under  the  Tenth  Amendment, \nFCPS’s APA ultra vires claims will likely succeed.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n2.  FCPS’s  declaratory  judgment  claim  is  likely  to \nsucceed.  \na.  The district court had declaratory-judgment jurisdiction.  \nFederal  courts  may  exercise  jurisdiction  over  declaratory  judgment \nclaims when \n(1) the complaint alleges an actual controversy between the \nparties  of  sufficient  immediacy  and  reality  to  warrant \nissuance of a declaratory judgment; (2) the court possesses an \nindependent  basis  for  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  (e.g., \nfederal question or diversity jurisdiction); and (3) the court \ndoes not abuse its discretion in its exercise of jurisdiction. \nVolvo Const. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co., Inc., 386 F.3d 581, \n592 (4th Cir. 2004) (cleaned up); 28 U.S.C. § 2201.  Each of these elements \nis easily satisfied here. \nFirst,  the  Complaint  alleges  an  actual  controversy  between  the \nparties.    See  generally  R.1.    The  Complaint  sets  forth  APA  claims \nstemming from fundamentally incompatible interpretations of Title IX.  \nId.  \nSecond, this Court has an independent basis for jurisdiction over \nthe parties.  FCPS’s claims arise under the “laws … of the United States,” \n23 \n\n \n28 U.S.C. § 1331—specifically, Title IX and the APA.  See R.1 ¶¶ 2, 66–\n114.  Article III courts have jurisdiction.  See supra Section I. \nThird,  this  Court  has  determined  that  a  court  may  decline \ndeclaratory-judgment jurisdiction only for “good reason.”  Volvo, 386 F.3d \nat  594  (cleaned  up).    Courts  are  “obliged  to  rule  on  the  merits  of  a \ndeclaratory judgment action when declaratory relief will serve a useful \npurpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue, and will \nterminate  and  afford  relief  from  the  uncertainty,  insecurity,  and \ncontroversy  giving  rise  to  the  proceeding.”    Volvo,  386  F.3d  at  594 \n(cleaned up).  Here, a declaration affirming that FCPS’s policy does not \nviolate  Title  IX  would  settle  the  legal  issues  underlying  Defendants’ \nerroneous and dangerous decision to attach unsatisfiable conditions to \nFCPS’s federal funding. \nb.  FCPS’s policy codifies Grimm.  FCPS is likely to succeed on \nthe merits of its Title IX claim because, under Grimm, Title IX bars a \nschool board from prohibiting a student who identified as male from \nusing a high school’s sex-separated male bathroom.  972 F.3d at 619–20.  \nFCPS’s regulation implements that holding.  See R.1 ¶ 69.  Again, the \n24 \n\n \ndistrict  court—despite  its  erroneous  jurisdictional  ruling—has \n“unconditionally recognize[d]” that it is bound by Grimm.  R.28 at 4. \nB.  FCPS will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive \nrelief. \nAbsent emergency relief, FCPS will lack resources to meaningfully \nserve their most vulnerable student populations.  See R.1 ¶¶ 57–58, 97.  \nThe school year has now begun, and with its start, Defendants have \nconditioned FCPS’s federal funding on FCPS taking illegal actions.  See \nid.  Defendants’ actions strips FCPS of $160 million in federal funds \nCongress appropriated for FCPS’s 2025–2026 school year.  Id. ¶¶ 56–64.   \nDefendants’ action bars access to $61 million in federal funds that \nFCPS needs to provide nutrition services, including free and reduced-\nprice meals, and to ensure that its cafeterias can feed its students high-\nquality meals.  Id. ¶ 58.  Defendants further deny access to $41 million \ndesignated to support students with disabilities.  Id.  Defendants also \ndeny  access  to  $65  million  allocated  to  support  students’  academic \nachievement.  Id.  Defendants’ legally unsupportable decision to strip \nFCPS of these resources will likely impose lasting harm on the many \nstudents who depend on the programs that these federal grants make \n25 \n\n \npossible, thus vitiating FCPS’s constitutional duty to provide them with \na free and high-quality education.   \nEven “economic damages may constitute irreparable harm where \nno  remedy  is  available  at  the  conclusion  of  litigation.”    Mt.  Valley \nPipeline, LLC v. W. Pocahontas Props. Ltd. P’ship, 918 F.3d 353, 366 (4th \nCir. 2019).  Here, the harm is irreparable because these claims arising \nunder Congress’s spending power are not contract claims and so FCPS \nwill be unable to seek damages in the Court of Federal Claims.   \nC.  The balance of equities and public interest favor FCPS. \nThe balance of hardships and public interest also strongly favor \ninjunctive  relief.    Where  the  government  is  a  party—as  here—the \nbalance-of-equities  and  public-interest  prongs  of  the  preliminary-\ninjunction test merge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  Here, \nthe harm to FCPS far outweighs any potential harm to Defendants, and \nweighs heavily in favor of injunctive relief.  The public interests at issue \nhere include providing students served by FCPS with a fully funded \neducational experience, as guaranteed by the Virginia Constitution.  See \nVA. CONST. art. VIII § 1.  FCPS relies on federal funding to meet that \nobligation.  FCPS cannot satisfy that interest if it cannot access the funds \n26 \n\n \nCongress appropriated for it because the Defendants ignored Grimm and \narbitrarily imposed a “high-risk” designation on FCPS.  \nConversely,  injunctive  relief  would  not  harm  Defendants.    An \ninjunction would preserve the status quo—the “high-risk” designation \nwould effectively be stayed and Defendants would be required to continue \nto  provide  funds  Congress  appropriated  for  FCPS.    Moreover, \n“[c]ompliance with Title IX,” an important and well-established federal \ncivil rights statute, is in the public interest.  Harris v. Wood, 888 F. Supp. \n747,  778  (W.D.  Va.  1995).    Indeed,  because  Defendants’  purported \njustification for their actions is enforcement of Title IX, they can scarcely \nargue otherwise.

(the “APA”), \nand the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and alleges for its complaint as follows:2 \nINTRODUCTION \n  On August 19, 2025, the Department of Education (the “Department”) issued a \npress release announcing that it was “placing . . . [FCPS] . . . in Northern Virginia on high-risk \nstatus” with the result that “all Department funds including formula funding, discretionary grants, \nand impact aid grants” will be “done by reimbursement only.”3   \n \n1 Plaintiff Fairfax County School Board operates, maintains and supervises the Fairfax County \nPublic Schools (“FCPS”). \n \n2 Arlington School Board (“ASB”) has filed against Defendants a similar action and motion for \nimmediate issuance of an order for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.  \nGiven the similar nature of the action and motions, ASB and FCSB request that the two actions \nand motions be consolidated. \n \n3 See Ex. A, Office of Comm’cns & Outreach, “U.S. Department of Education Places Five \nNorthern Virginia School Districts on High-Risk Status and Reimbursement Payment Status for \nViolating Title IX,” U.S. DEP’T OF EDUC. (Aug. 19, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/26kzwz3y.  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 2 of 31 PageID# 2\n \n  The Department sought to justify this decision by a bare, and incorrect, assertion \nthat FCPS (and four other Northern Virginia school districts) have been “in violation of Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972.”4  Defendants assert that FCPS violates Title IX by \nmaintaining a policy that permits students to access restrooms and locker rooms (“facilities”) that \nalign with their gender identity.   \n  Later on August 19, 2025 Defendant McMahon sent a letter to FCPS notifying it of \nthis change in status and asserting that it encouraged the Virginia Department of Education \n(“VDOE”) to similarly withhold federal funds passed through state funding mechanisms to FCPS.  \nEx. B. \n  Defendants’ action came a mere two business days after the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fourth Circuit reaffirmed that its interpretation of Title IX in Grimm v. Gloucester County \nSchool Board, 972 F.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020) remains the law in Northern Virginia as well as the \nrest of the Circuit.  In Grimm, the Fourth Circuit held that both the Equal Protection Clause and \nTitle IX compel local school boards to provide students with access to facilities that correspond \nwith their gender identity.  As Fourth Circuit panel precedent, Grimm binds FCPS. \n  Defendants’ placement of FCPS on “high-risk status” and conditioning its federal \nfunding is a final agency action subject to APA review.  Defendants’ action cannot withstand that \nreview because it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise contrary to law.  \nAccordingly, this Court must hold unlawful and set aside Defendants’ action.  5 U.S.C. § 706. \n  The Court should separately declare that FCPS’s policy does not violate Title IX \nbecause Grimm is controlling law in the Fourth Circuit. \n \n4 Id. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 3 of 31 PageID# 3\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this \naction arises under the laws of the United States, including the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06; the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201; and Title IX. \n  Venue  is  proper  in  this  district  under  28  U.S.C.  §§ 1391(b)(2)  and  (e)(1).  \nDefendants Department of Education and Secretary McMahon are a United States agency and an \nofficer of the United States sued in her official capacity.  FCSB is a public body operating in the \nEastern District of Virginia.  FCPS is a local government agency operating in the Eastern District \nof Virginia.  A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred \nand continues to occur within this District.  \nPARTIES \n  Plaintiff FCSB operates, maintains, and supervises the FCPS.   \n  FCPS is a school district within the Commonwealth of Virginia.  FCPS is the \nindependent branch of the Fairfax County government that administers public schools in Fairfax \nCounty and the independent City of Fairfax.   \n  Defendant the Department of Education (“DOE”) is an executive department of the \nUnited States.  It is headquartered in Washington, D.C. \n  Defendant Linda McMahon is the United States Secretary of Education and is sued \nsolely in that capacity.  As Secretary of Education, Defendant McMahon is head of the DOE. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Title IX bars discrimination on the basis of sex. \n  This matter involves a dispute over the scope of Title IX of the Higher Education \nAmendments of 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-318, which provides in pertinent part that “[n]o person in \nthe United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 4 of 31 PageID# 4\n \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n  Nothing in the text of Title IX prohibits schools from allowing transgender students \nfrom accessing school facilities that align with their gender identity.  To the contrary, several U.S. \nCourts of Appeals—including the Fourth Circuit—have held that Title IX requires schools to \nallow such access. \n  To enforce Title IX, Congress “authorized and directed” every federal agency \nproviding financial assistance to education programs or activities to “effectuate the provisions of \n[20  U.S.C.  § 1681]  .  .  .  by  issuing  rules,  regulations,  or  orders  of  general  applicability.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n  Congress  expressly  declared  that  any  action  by  the  department  or  agency \n“terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance” is subject to judicial review \nunder the APA, that “any State” may obtain judicial review, and that the federal agency’s action \n“shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion.”  20 U.S.C. § 1683. \n  In a letter sent to FCPS on August 19, 2025, the Department has made clear that \nFCPS will not receive reimbursement unless it accedes to Defendants’ interpretation of Title IX, \nwhich is not consistent with the interpretation that binds FCPS (and this Court).  Accordingly, the \nDepartment’s order placing FCPS on “reimbursement-only” status while FCPS complies with the \nFourth Circuit’s binding interpretation of Title IX constitutes in fact a refusal to continue federal \nfinancial assistance within the meaning of 20 U.S.C. §§ 1682 and 1683. \nII.  The Department’s regulations echo Title IX’s requirements. \n  The  Department’s  regulations  implementing  Title  IX  are  codified  at \n34 C.F.R. Part 106.   \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 5 of 31 PageID# 5\n \n  The Department’s regulations require covered entities to “provide separate toilet, \nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of \none  sex  shall  be  comparable  to  such  facilities  provided  for  students  of  the  other  sex.”  \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  They do not expressly address a student’s ability to access facilities that align \nwith their gender identity. \n  The Department’s regulations adopt and apply the procedures for enforcing Title \nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to its Title IX regulations.  34 C.F.R. § 106.81 (adopting and \napplying 34 C.F.R. §§ 100.6–100.11). \n  These regulations require that the Department “shall to the fullest extent practicable \nseek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide \nassistance  and  guidance  to  recipients  to  help  them  comply  voluntarily  with  this  part.”  \n34 C.F.R. § 100.6(a).   \n  If  noncompliance  is  found,  and  it  cannot  be  corrected  by  informal  means, \ncompliance “may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue \nFederal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law.”  34 C.F.R. § 100.8(a); \nsee also 28 C.F.R. § 42.108.  \n  Pursuant to the Department’s procedures:  \n[n]o order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal \nfinancial  assistance  shall  become  effective  until  (1) the  responsible \nDepartment official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to \ncomply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary \nmeans, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity \nfor hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a \nrequirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; and (3) the expiration of 30 \ndays after the Secretary has filed with the committee of the House and the \ncommittee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program \ninvolved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such \naction. \n \n- 5 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 6 of 31 PageID# 6\n \n34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c). \n \n  The Department’s procedures also provide:  \nAny action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue \nFederal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, \nor part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has \nbeen made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part \nthereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.  \n \n34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c). \n \nIII.  The  Fourth  Circuit  follows  other  Circuit Courts of Appeals in concluding that \nTitle IX protects transgender individuals’ access to facilities that correspond with \ntheir gender identity. \n  Defendants’ action to suspend federal funds allocated to FCPS has no legal basis, \nas it relies upon an incorrect interpretation of Title IX that is flatly inconsistent with binding \nprecedent in the Fourth Circuit.   \n  In 2020, in Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, 972 F.3d 586 (4th Cir. \n2020), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit considered the right of transgender \nstudents to access school facilities that correspond with their gender identity.  In that case, a local \nVirginia school division, in response to backlash about a transgender male student’s use of the \nboys’ restroom, implemented a policy under which students could only use restrooms matching \ntheir “biological gender.”  Grimm, 972 F.3d at 593.  The policy also required that “students with \ngender identity issues shall be provided an alternative appropriate private facility.”  Id. at 599.  To \neffectuate this policy, a number of single-stall unisex restrooms were made available to all \nstudents.  Id. at 600.   \n  The court in Grimm analogized the facts at issue to those involved in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), in which the United States Supreme Court held that \ndiscrimination against a person for being transgender is discrimination “on the basis of sex,” under \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act.   Grimm, 972 F.3d at 616–19.  Following Bostock, the Court of \n- 6 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 7 of 31 PageID# 7\n \nAppeals concluded that the policy discriminated against Grimm “on the basis of sex” under Title \nIX, reasoning that “Grimm was treated worse than students with whom he was similarly situated \nbecause he alone could not use the restroom corresponding with his gender.”   Id.  at  618.  \nAccordingly, the court found Grimm’s gender identity to be a protected status pursuant to Title \nIX, invalidating the school’s restroom restriction.  Id. \n  Grimm stands for the proposition that policies that prohibit transgender students \nfrom using the facilities that align with their gender identity constitute sex-based discrimination \nand violate Title IX.  Id.  The FCPS policy at issue is consistent with Grimm and therefore complies \nwith, not violates, Title IX.5   \n  Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, Grimm remains binding law in the Fourth \nCircuit and has not been abrogated by United States v. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025), a case \nupholding a Tennessee law that prohibited certain medical interventions for minors with gender \n \n5 While most courts which have considered the issue of Title IX’s application to gender identity \nhave ruled consistent with the Fourth Circuit in Grimm, several courts have issued contrary rulings.  \nCompare Parents for Priv. v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1227 (9th Cir. 2020) (affirming dismissal of \nlawsuit brought by plaintiffs who alleged a school district’s policy permitting students to use \nfacilities that match their gender identity violated Title IX and holding that a transgender student’s \nnormal use of facilities alone does not constitute actional “harassment” under Title IX even if some \nstudents felt subjectively harassed); Doe ex rel. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, \n533 (3d Cir. 2018) (rejecting argument that a school district’s policy allowing transgender students \nto use facilities that align with their gender identity violated Title IX because the policy treated all \nstudents equally irrespective of sex); Whitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 \nBd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1046–50 (7th Cir. 2017), abrogated on other grounds as recognized \nby, Ill. Republican Party v. Pritzker, 973 F.3d 760, 762 (7th Cir. 2020) (holding that a policy \nrequiring students to use a bathroom that conforms with their gender identity punishes those \nstudents for their gender nonconformance and therefore violates Title IX), with Adams ex rel. \nKasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 816 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (holding that a \npolicy disallowing transgender students from using the bathroom that aligned with their gender \nidentity did not violate Title IX).  See also Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., 104 F.4th 577, 610–11 \n(6th Cir. 2024) (interpreting Title IX regulations “[w]ithout deciding any substantive merits \nquestions”).  \n- 7 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 8 of 31 PageID# 8\n \ndysphoria as constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, or any other United States Supreme \nCourt case. \n  Indeed, on August 15, 2025, the Fourth Circuit reaffirmed that “Grimm remains the \nlaw of this Circuit and is thus binding on all the district courts within it.”  Doe v. South Carolina, \nNo. 25-1787, 2025 WL 2375386, at *8 (4th Cir. Aug. 15, 2025).  The Doe case involved a \nchallenge to a South Carolina statute that included a restriction on restroom access to students \naccording to their gender assigned at birth—a policy identical to that struck down in Grimm.  Id. \nat **2–3.  Doe moved for a preliminary injunction, relying on Grimm in support of his assertion \nthat the South Carolina statute violated Title IX.  Id. at *5.   \n  Applying the legal standard for a preliminary injunction, the court found that Doe \nhad demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, as the South Carolina statute at issue was \nin direct conflict with the court’s ruling in Grimm.  Id. at **16–17.  The court also found that Doe \nhad demonstrated irreparable harm, observing that “state action infringing [on] constitutional \nrights generally constitutes irreparable harm.”  Id. at *8.  Finally, the court found that the balance \nof equities supports the injunction, noting that “preventing the State from enforcing a policy that \ndirectly contradicts Grimm—a prior, binding decision of this [c]ourt”—was clearly in the public \ninterest.  Id. at *9. \n  In  his  concurrence  to  the  court’s  opinion  in  Doe,  Chief  Judge  Diaz  directly \naddressed South Carolina’s argument that Grimm had been abrogated by prior United States \nSupreme Court decisions.  Id. at **10–11.  He specifically noted that the Supreme Court’s decision \nin United States v. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025) “has little to say about the issues Grimm \naddressed,” given that it involved a statute prohibiting medical care that applied to all minors rather \nthan a sex-based restriction on facility access.  Id. at *10.  Accordingly, Judge Diaz found that \n- 8 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 9 of 31 PageID# 9\n \n“Skrmetti said nothing whatsoever to cause doubt as to the vitality of Grimm’s Title IX holding.”  \nId. at *9.  \n  Similarly instructive is the concurrence of Judge Agee, who dissented in Grimm.  \nDespite his disagreement with the court’s holding in Grimm, Judge Agee nonetheless stated that it \nremains binding authority in the Fourth Circuit.  “Grimm binds all the judges of this Circuit, \nnotwithstanding  any  expectation  that  the  Supreme  Court  will  adjust,  if  not  overrule,  the \nfoundations of Grimm in a way that is likely to determine whether Doe will ultimately prevail in \nthis action.  The current law of this Circuit answers the question of whether Doe has satisfied the \nrequirements for obtaining an injunction pending the appeal.”  Id. at *14.6  \n  Unless and until either the en banc Fourth Circuit reconsiders the holding of Grimm \nor the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether transgender status is a protected class under Title IX, \nGrimm remains controlling in the Fourth Circuit.7   \nIV.  Virginia’s  anti-discrimination  law  further  requires  FCPS  to  provide  access  to \nfacilities that match individuals’ gender identities. \n  Virginia law is consistent with Grimm and prohibits discrimination based on gender \nidentity.  In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly expanded the scope of the Virginia Human \nRights  Act  (VA.  CODE  ANN.  § 2.2-3900–3909),  by  adopting  the  Virginia  Values  Act  (the \n \n6 On August 28, 2025, the defendants in Doe filed a petition for certiorari in the United States \nSupreme Court. \n7 The United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving the scope of Title IX as \napplied to transgender student participation in school sports in its upcoming term, a case that may \nbut has not yet provided further guidance as to the scope of Title IX.  The Court recently granted \ncert in West Virginia v. B.P.J., a case involving a West Virginia law which limits participation in \nwomen’s sports programs to students whose gender was female at birth.  B.P.J. by Jackson v. W. \nVirginia State Bd. of Educ., 98 F.4th 542, 550 (4th Cir.), cert. granted sub nom. W. Virginia v. B. \nP. J., No. 24-43, 2025 WL 1829164 (July 3, 2025).  The question for the Court in B.P.J. is whether \nTitle IX and the Equal Protection Clause prevent a state from designating school sports teams \nbased on biological sex.  The Court’s decision may provide clarity as to whether or not Title IX \nrequires educational institutions to separate student resources by biological sex, without concern \nfor transgender students.   \n- 9 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 10 of 31 PageID# 10\n \n“Values Act”).8  The law “[s]afeguard[s] all individuals within the Commonwealth from unlawful \ndiscrimination because of … gender identity … in places of public accommodation, including \neducational institutions.”  VA. CODE ANN. § 2.2-3900.  The Values Act defines “gender identity” \nas “the gender-related identity, appearance, or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, \nwith or without regard to the individual’s designated sex at birth.”  VA. CODE ANN. § 2.2-3901. \n  Virginia law also states that “[a] county may enact an ordinance prohibiting \ndiscrimination in . . . education on the basis of . . . gender identity.”  VA. CODE ANN. § 15.2-853.   \n  In 2021, VDOE issued Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students \nin Virginia Public Schools, which provided that “[s]tudents should be allowed to use the facility \nthat corresponds to their gender identity” and advised that schools should provide all students \naccess to single-user restrooms and private changing areas for those who would like more privacy.9   \n  Upon the accession of Glenn Youngkin to the office of Governor of Virginia in \n2022, the VDOE issued new guidance on the issue of transgender student access to school \nfacilities.  Despite the fact that there has been no change to the Virginia Code, VDOE issued the \n2023 Model Policies to Ensure Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in \nVirginia’s Public Schools, which state that a student “shall use bathrooms that correspond with his \nor her sex, except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.  See Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. \nSch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020).” \n \n8 S.B. 868, 161st Gen. Assemb. Reg. Sess.

FCPS drafted this regulation \nin response to the Virginia Values Act, which prevents discrimination based on gender identity.   \n  Section IX of Regulation 2603.2 provides as follows:  \na)  “Gender-expansive and transgender students shall be provided with the option of \nusing a locker room or restroom consistent with the student’s gender identity.” \nb)  “When  an  instructional  or  extra-curricular  event  requires  students  to  be \naccommodated overnight, students may be assigned to a room consistent with the \nstudent’s gender identity.”  \nc)  “Any student who has a need or desire for increased privacy, regardless of the \nunderlying reason including gender identity, shall be provided with a reasonable, \nnon-stigmatizing alternative such as the use of a private area (e.g., a nearby \nrestroom stall with a door, an area separated by a curtain, or a nearby health or \nsingle-use/unisex bathroom), or with a separate changing schedule (e.g., using the \nlocker room that corresponds to the student’s gender identity before or after other \nstudents).  Such alternative options will minimize impact to instructional time to \nthe extent possible.”  \nd)  “Any alternative arrangement should be provided in a way that protects the ability \nof students to keep their gender-expansive or transgender status or other underlying \nreason  for  the  request  confidential.    FCPS  will  maintain  confidentiality  of \nnonpublic information about students, releasing this information to third parties \nonly when authorized by a student or parent.”   \n- 11 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 12 of 31 PageID# 12\n \ne)  “In no case shall a gender-expansive or transgender student be required to use a \nlocker room or restroom that conflicts with the student’s gender identity or be \nlimited to using only a private area, single-occupancy accommodation, or other \nsingle-use facility as described in this section.”   \nf)  “Gender-expansive and transgender students may also be provided with the option \nof using the facilities that correspond to the student’s sex assigned at birth.”10  Ex. \nC. \nVI.  The Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education investigates FCPS’s \npolicies. \n  Despite the clear authority which authorizes the FCPS policy at issue in this matter, \nthe Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) of the United States Department of Education has launched \nan investigation which seeks to compel FCPS to change its policy in a manner contrary to law.  On \nFebruary 12, 2025, OCR issued a Notification Letter to FCPS indicating that a complaint had been \nfiled alleging that FCPS’s policy regarding use of sex-segregated facilities such as restrooms and \nlocker rooms (Regulation 2603.2) violated Title IX by providing greater rights to students who are \ntransgender than to those who are cisgender.  Ex. D.  On February 24, 2025, OCR sent FCPS a \nData Request Letter requesting a number of documents and responses.  Ex. E. \n  The complaint was generated by America First Legal (“AFL”), a conservative \nnonprofit organization founded by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.   \n  FCPS promptly responded on March 24, 2025 with documents and a narrative \nresponse defending the policy.  FCPS cited state law and the Fourth Circuit’s Grimm opinion as \n \n10 See FCPS Regulation 2603.2, FAIRFAX_OCR_1307_0000049.  All FCPS policies, bylaws, \nand \nregulations are publicly available at https://insys.fcps.edu/schoolboardapps/report_policy/cache/a\nlpha-A.htm.  \n- 12 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 13 of 31 PageID# 13\n \nthe bases for its protection of transgender students’ access to facilities aligned with their gender \nidentity.  Ex. F. \n  On July 25, 2025, OCR concluded its investigation by issuing a Findings Letter.  \nEx. G.  In that letter, OCR asserted that the FCPS’s policies and similar facilities-access policies \nof  four  other  school  divisions  in  Northern  Virginia—those  for  Arlington,  Loudoun,  Prince \nWilliam,  and  Alexandria  Counties—violate  Title  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations.    Id.  \nAccompanying the Findings Letter, OCR delivered a draft Resolution Agreement which requires \nthat each division (1) modify its policy to ensure that access to restroom and locker room facilities \nwill be limited by students’ sex assigned at birth; and (2) ensure that all policies adopt OCR’s \ndefinition of the terms “sex, female, male, girls, women, boys [and] men.”  OCR’s definitions of \nthese terms treat individuals exclusively according to the sex assigned them at birth.  Ex. H. \n  On July 29, 2025, counsel to all five of the impacted school divisions submitted a \njoint request to OCR for 90 days to respond to the July 25, 2025 Findings Letter, consistent with \nthe timeframe for negotiated resolutions provided in the OCR Case Processing Manual.  Ex. I. \n  On July 31, 2025, OCR’s Regional Director Bradley Burke rejected the July 29th \nrequest for extension and instead imposed a deadline of August 15, 2025, for FCPS and the other \nimpacted school divisions to notify OCR as to “whether or not [each Division] is willing to \nconsider agreeing to the terms in the draft resolution agreement.”  Ex. J. \n  On August 15, 2025, FCPS submitted a response letter to OCR, stating that FCPS \nwas bound by Fourth Circuit precedent and could not modify its policies or agree to the terms of \nthe Resolution Agreement without exposing itself to a risk of litigation for violating federal and \nstate law.  Ex. K.  FCPS proposed that OCR refrain from referring the matter to the DOJ until the \nSupreme Court has issued its decision in West Virginia v. B. P. J., No. 24-43, 2025 WL 1829164 \n- 13 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 14 of 31 PageID# 14\n \n(certiorari granted July 3, 2025), which raises a related but distinct issue of Title IX transgender \nsex discrimination in athletic teams.  Id. \n  On August 18, 2025, FCPS submitted a supplemental response letter to OCR, \nproviding additional authority for FCPS’s position that it is bound by Fourth Circuit precedent—\nthe opinion issued on Friday, August 15 by the United States Court of Appeals in John Doe v. \nState of South Carolina, which makes clear that Grimm remains good law and controls the issue \nof student restroom access in the Fourth Circuit.  Ex. L.   \nVII.  Defendants  designate  FCPS  as  a  “high-risk”  entity  and  place  FCPS  in \n“reimbursement only” status. \n  On August 19, 2025, the Department “designated [FCPS] as a ‘high-risk’ entity, \nunder all the programs administered by the Department for which [FCPS] receives funds” due to \nFCPS’s purported “noncompliance with Title IX.”  Ex. B at 1. \n  The Department also stated that it has designated FCPS as a “high-risk” entity in \naccordance with 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.208 and 3474.1.  Ex. B at 2–3.  The factors set forth in § 200.208 \nthat the Department is required to consider include (1) “[r]eview of OMB-designated repositories \nof government-wide data [] or review of its risk assessment;” (2) FCPS’s “history of compliance \nwith  the  terms  and  conditions  of  Federal  awards;”  (3)  FCPS’s  “ability  to  meet  expected \nperformance goals as described in § 200.211;” or (4) “a determination of whether [FCPS] has \ninadequate  financial  capability  to  perform  the  Federal  award.”    2  C.F.R.  §  200.208.    The \nDepartment  stated  that  it  considered  “the  possible  magnitude  of  the  potential  gross \nmismanagement of public funds while violating applicable laws,” “the improper organizational \nmanagement and operations that led to the problems discussed above,” and “concerns regarding \nyour division’s lack of proper controls.”  Ex. B at 2–3.   \n- 14 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 15 of 31 PageID# 15\n \n  The Department stated that it was “placing specific conditions on [FCPS’s] use of \nfunds in all grants it receives from the Department.”  Id. at 1–2.  In particular, “[d]ue to the sizable \namount of Federal grant funds that are provided to [FCPS], and concerns discussed in this letter, \nthe Department will place all of [FCPS’s] grants on reimbursement payment status.”  Id. at 2.  \n“Under this specific condition, [FCPS] will, when it submits a request to drawdown [sic] funds for \na particular obligation it intends to charge to a Department grant, submit to the Department or the \nappropriate State division detailed documentation establishing that the expenditure in question can \nbe allowably charged to the grant and has already been paid for by [FCPS] with non-Federal \nfunds.” Id. at 3. \n  Further, the Department demanded that “within 30 days of the date of this letter” \nFCPS would comply with two further “specific conditions”: \na)  “[FCPS] must submit plans for compliance with all federal laws, and provide \ndetailed information that identifies and discusses the steps [FCPS] will take to \nensure that grant funds will be spent in accordance with all appliable [sic] laws \n(this could include committing to implementing the resolution agreement sent \nto [FCPS] on July 25, 2025, with OCR’s findings).”  Ex. B at 3.  \nb)  “[FCPS] must submit a corrective action plan (as noted above, this could \ninclude committing to implement the OCR resolution agreement) that shows all \nsteps taken to be in compliance with the applicable laws and assurances, that \ncompliance will be properly maintained, that includes a proposed schedule to \nmonitor the implementation of the corrective actions, and, if appropriate, a \nschedule of when the corrective actions will be completed and by whom (the \n- 15 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 16 of 31 PageID# 16\n \nresponsible division representative).  If deemed necessary, the Department may \nrequire additional actions to be included in the plan.”  Id. at 3. \n  The Department’s August 19, 2025 letter makes clear that FCPS will not receive \nreimbursement unless it accedes to the Department’s interpretation of Title IX, which is not \nconsistent with the interpretation that binds FCPS (and this Court).  Accordingly, Defendants’ \norder  placing  FCPS  on  “reimbursement-only” status  while  FCPS  complies  with  the  Fourth \nCircuit’s binding interpretation of Title IX constitutes a refusal to continue federal financial \nassistance within the meaning of Title IX and the Department’s regulations implementing it. \n  Defendants’ challenged actions are agency actions within the meaning of the APA \nbecause they constitute the entireties or parts of agency orders or sanctions, or the equivalent \nthereof.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). \n  Defendants’ challenged actions are final agency actions because they represent the \nculmination of Defendants’ decision-making process on specific conditions imposed on FCPS due \nto FCPS’s legally mandated facilities-access policies.  Further, Defendants’ action has immediate \nlegal and real-world effects—namely, they purport to have adjudicated FCPS to be in violation of \nTitle IX and they have altered the conditions under which FCPS may receive funding to which it \nis otherwise entitled.  Indeed, because FCPS cannot—consistent with the law that binds it—alter \nthose facilities-access policies without risking litigation, and because Defendants have conditioned \nreimbursement on FCPS altering those policies, Defendants have in fact refused to continue \nproviding federal funds to FCPS. \nVIII.  FCPS has suffered irreparable harm and the balance of equities weighs in its favor. \n  Defendants’ action constitutes irreparable harm to FCPS.  Because Defendants \nhave conditioned FCPS’s receipt of federal funds on requirements FCPS cannot lawfully satisfy, \nFCPS has in fact lost access to those funds. \n- 16 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 17 of 31 PageID# 17\n \n  For fiscal year 2026, FCPS anticipates that roughly $167 million of its budget will \ncomes from the federal government.  \n  The largest portion—$61 million—funds food and nutrition services, which pays \nthe salaries of FCPS’s food services staff, allows FCPS to provide low-income students with free \nand reduced price meals, and ensures that FCPS’s cafeterias are operating efficiently so that FCPS \ncan feed its students high-quality meals.  FCPS receives another $41 million to ensure that FCPS \ncan provide services to its students with disabilities, as required by the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA).  The remaining $65 million is used to support students experiencing \nhomelessness, boost the academic performance of low-income students and English learners, \nincrease student achievement, improve the quality, quantity, and effectiveness of FCPS’s teachers, \nprincipals, and other leaders, and provide career, technical education, and adult and community \neducation programs. \n  While FCPS’s injury is primarily economic, money damages are unavailable as \nagainst the Federal Government due to federal sovereign immunity.  See Mountain Valley Pipeline, \nLLC v. W. Pocahontas Props. Ltd. P’ship, 918 F.3d 353, 366 (4th Cir. 2019) (“economic damages \nmay constitute irreparable harm where no remedy is available at the conclusion of litigation”); City \nof New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 913 F.3d 423, 430 (4th Cir. 2019) (“The APA waives the federal \ngovernment’s sovereign immunity for a limited set of suits, brought by ‘a person suffering legal \nwrong  because  of  agency  action’  to  obtain  relief  ‘other  than  money  damages.’”)  (quoting \n5 U.S.C. § 702). \n  The Department and Defendant McMahon, as appendages of the federal Executive \nBranch, are bound by the President’s duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  \nU.S. CONST. art II, § 3.  Accordingly, none of the Defendants can have any protectable interest in \n- 17 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 18 of 31 PageID# 18\n \nenforcing the Department’s unlawful order, which is based on the Department’s express refusal to \nfollow precedent that binds FCPS, this Court, and Defendants. \n  FCPS has an interest in providing its students with “an educational program of high \nquality” in accordance with its duties under the Virginia Constitution.  See VA. CONST. art. VIII, \n§ 1. \n  FCPS  further  has  an  interest  in  ensuring  that  its  students  are  afforded  all \nconstitutional  and  legal  protections  they  are  due,  including  those  established  by  binding \ninterpretations of federal anti-discrimination statutes such as Title IX. \n  FCPS also has an interest in ensuring that its own actions comply with all legal \nrequirements. \n  Accordingly, the balance of equities and the public interest weigh in favor of \ninjunctive relief. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCount I ‒ under the Administrative Procedure Act  \n(against Defendants McMahon and the Department) \n  FCSB repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–64 as though fully set forth herein. \n  Defendants Secretary McMahon and the Department’s constructive termination of \nor refusal to continue federal funds owed to FCPS based on Defendants’ assertion that FCPS \nviolated Title IX constitutes a final agency action reviewable under the APA.  20 U.S.C. § 1683. \n  The APA requires that the Court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n  Defendants’ action designating FCPS as a “high-risk” entity is not based on any \nidentifiable factor or factors set forth in 2 C.F.R. § 200.208.  Though Defendants claim to have \n- 18 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 19 of 31 PageID# 19\n \nconsidered FCPS’s “potential gross mismanagement of public funds,” “improper organizational \nmanagement and operations,” and “lack of proper controls,” the Department has provided no \nevidence to support these findings.  FCPS has never been notified of a failed audit, mismanagement \nof specific funds, or issues regarding its internal controls prior to receiving this designation.  \nAccordingly,  designating  FCPS  as  “high-risk”  based  on  the  Department’s  purported \n“consideration” of the § 200.208 factors is arbitrary and capricious.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n  Defendants’ action constructively terminating or refusing to continue funds owed \nto FCPS is not in accordance with the law set forth in Grimm.  The refusal to continue funds was \npremised on FCPS’s alleged violation of Title IX as a result of its implementation of Regulation \n2603.2, but that regulation merely codifies the holding of Grimm, which interpreted Title IX with \nbinding effect on FCPS, this Court, and Defendants. \n  Defendants’ action imposes unwarranted penalties on FCPS not because FCPS has \nviolated any law but because FCPS is bound to follow and is following the Fourth Circuit’s \nprecedent, which is binding within FCPS’s geographical area (and which, moreover, binds this \nCourt).    Defendants’  action  is  accordingly  an  abuse  of  discretion  and  contrary  to  law.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n  Defendants’ action targeting FCPS (and four other Northern Virginia schools) is \narbitrary and capricious because it singles out FCPS, while ignoring similarly situated districts in \nVirginia  and  across  the  country  that  have  similar  policies  regarding  student  access  to \nfacilities.  Defendants have not articulated a sufficient and substantiated reason to explain why \nFCPS is subject to this action while others are not.  This disparate treatment, without a rational \nbasis, violates the fundamental principal that agency action must be based on reasoned decision-\nmaking.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n- 19 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 20 of 31 PageID# 20\n \nAgency discretion is not unbounded, and selective enforcement without justification renders \nDefendants’ action arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see \nKirk v. Comm’r of SSA, 987 F.3d 314, 321 (4th Cir. 2021) (“‘Where an agency applies different \nstandards to similarly situated entities and fails to support this disparate treatment with a reasoned \nexplanation and substantial evidence in the record, its action is arbitrary and capricious and cannot \nbe upheld.’”) (quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 403 F.3d 771, \n777 (D.C. Cir. 2005)).  \nCount II – under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Spending Clause \n(against Defendants McMahon and the Department) \n  FCSB repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–71 as though fully set forth herein. \n  Separately, the Court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n  The federal government may not compel states to enact or administer federal \nregulatory programs.  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 188 (1992). \n  Congress’s power to legislate is constrained by Article I, and its power to spend the \npublic fisc does not carry with it authority to commandeer the separate sovereign states’ legislative \nor administrative apparatus for federal purposes.  Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 933 (1997).   \n  The executive’s power with respect to the laws of the United States extends only to \nthe power to “take care that [they] be faithfully executed.”  U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3.  The executive, \nwhen executing Congress’s laws, accordingly may not do by executive action what Congress is \nconstrained not to do by the Constitution’s limitations. \n- 20 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 21 of 31 PageID# 21\n \n  To the contrary, exercising powers beyond those expressly granted to the executive \nand legislative branches would invade the powers reserved to the states and to the people.  \nU.S. CONST. arts. I, II;  U.S. CONST. amend. X. \n  Here, the executive seeks to pervert Congress’s spending power to compel FCPS \nand  other  school  divisions  in  Northern  Virginia  to  enact  and  administer  the  executive’s \nadministrative program with respect to transgender individuals. \n  Because  the  executive’s  action  seeks  to  commandeer  power  reserved  to  the \nCommonwealth and its people, it is contrary to Constitutional power and must be held unlawful \nand set aside.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \nCount III ‒ under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Declaratory Judgment Act, and \nthe Spending Clause: Lack of Notice  \n(against Defendants McMahon and the Department) \n  FCSB repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–79 as though fully set forth herein. \n  The  Court  must  “hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  agency  action,  findings,  and \nconclusions found to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n  Defendants’ action interprets Congress’s grant of funding to FCPS in a manner that \nwould violate the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution because FCPS did not have clear notice \nthat  any  federal  funding  would  be  conditioned  on  (1) rescinding  Regulation  2603.2  and \ncategorically banning students from accessing facilities in accordance with their gender identity or \n(2) issuing public statements regarding the meaning of Title IX or the definition of sex, female, \nmale, girls, women, boys, or men.   \n- 21 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 22 of 31 PageID# 22\n \n  Article I of the U.S. Constitution specifically grants Congress the power “to pay \nthe  Debts  and  provide  for  common  Defence  and  general  Welfare  of  the  United  States.”  \nU.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n  Incident to the spending power, “Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of \nfederal funds.”  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987).  However, any conditions must \nbe imposed “unambiguously” to enable “States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of \nthe consequences of their participation.”  Id. at 207 (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)).  “There can, of course, be no knowing acceptance if a \n[recipient] is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.”  Pennhurst, \n451 U.S. at 17. \n  Defendants’ sole authority with respect to the laws of the United States is to “take \ncare that [they] be faithfully executed.”  U.S. CONST. Art. II § 3; see also U.S. CONST. Amend. X \n(reserving to the states and the people those powers not delegated to the federal government by the \nConstitution).  Where Congress may not impose ambiguous or unlawful conditions, the Executive \nsimilarly may not interpret acts of Congress to impose those conditions consistent with its duty to \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed. \n  FCPS accepted federal funding with the understanding that it was required to \ncomply with Title IX and binding judicial precedent interpreting Title IX.   \n  Congress has not clearly stated, and no court has found, that Title IX prohibits \nFCPS from maintaining its challenged policies.  To the contrary, Regulation 2603.2 complies with \nand codifies governing Fourth Circuit precedent as set forth in Grimm, which holds that excluding \ntransgender students from restrooms consistent with their gender identity violates Title IX and the \n- 22 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 23 of 31 PageID# 23\n \nEqual Protection Clause.  See also Am. Order, Doe v. S. Carolina, No. 25-1787, 2025 WL 2375386 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 15, 2025). \n  Defendants have nonetheless conditioned FCPS’s receipt of essential federal funds \non its agreement to abandon its policies in exchange for Defendants’ policies and adhere to a new, \nextratextual interpretation of Title IX that is directly contrary to prior agency interpretation and \ngoverning precedent. \n  Therefore, conditioning the Department funding to enforce a categorical ban on \nstudent access to facilities violates this limitation on spending power, because, inter alia, FCPS did \nnot have “clear notice” of such a condition.  See Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, \n548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006). \n  Because Defendants’ action is contrary to Congress’s constitutional power and to \nFCPS’s constitutional power reserved under the Tenth Amendment, Defendants’ action must be \nheld unlawful and set aside.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n  FCSB is separately entitled to a judicial declaration that Defendants’ action is \ncontrary to the federal government’s power under the Spending Clause.  28 U.S.C. § 2201. \nCount IV - under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Declaratory Judgment Act, and \nthe Spending Clause: Unconstitutional Coercion  \n(against Defendants McMahon and the Department) \n  FCSB repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–91 as though fully set forth herein. \n  The  Court  must  “hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  agency  action,  findings,  and \nconclusions found to be … contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n  Pursuant to the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution, “spending-\npower conditions are legitimate only if the [recipient’s] acceptance of them is in fact voluntary.”  \n- 23 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 24 of 31 PageID# 24\n \nMedina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 145 S. Ct. 2219, 2232 n.4 (2025) (citing NFIB v. Sebelius, \n567 U.S. 519, 581-82 (2012)).    \n  The Spending Clause permits the federal government to “encourage[]” compliance \nthrough funding conditions, not to punish or impose sanctions absent statutory authorization.  \nSebelius, 567 U.S. at 581.  The federal government may not wield its spending power as a “gun to \nthe head.”  Id. \n  Defendants’ sole authority with respect to the laws of the United States is to “take \ncare that [they] be faithfully executed.”  U.S. CONST. Art. II, § 3; see also U.S. CONST. Amend. X \n(reserving to the states and the people those powers not delegated to the federal government by the \nConstitution).  Where Congress may not impose ambiguous or unlawful conditions, the Executive \nsimilarly may not interpret acts of Congress to impose those conditions consistent with its duty to \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed. \n  FCPS receives federal education funds under several federal statutes including Title \nI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq.) and the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.).  These funds are critical \nto FCPS’s ability to provide state and federally mandated, education related services to its students, \nparticularly its most vulnerable students.  Loss of these funds is existential. \n  Defendants’ decision to designate FCPS as “high-risk,” place of all federal funds \non reimbursement status, and urge state entities to do the same because FCPS did not agree with \nDefendants’ unilateral interpretation—directly at odds with binding legal precedent—that the \nDistrict’s policies violate Title IX. \n- 24 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 25 of 31 PageID# 25\n \n  By designating FCPS as “high-risk” unless and until FCPS agrees with Defendants’ \ninterpretation of Title IX and rescinds Regulation 2603.2, Defendants are conditioning essential \nfederal funding on FCPS’s capitulation to Defendants’ extralegal demands. \n  “Appeal” of FCPS’s “high-risk” status to Defendants is futile and does not afford \nit meaningful review, as Defendants have made clear that compliance with their demands is the \nonly pathway for FCPS to continue to receive essential federal funding. \n  This  threat  amounts  to  unconstitutional  coercion  under  the  Spending  Clause.  \nSebelius, 567 U.S. at 581.  Placing FCPS on “high-risk” status and withholding all federal funding, \nincluding State-administered funds earmarked for the FCPS’s most vulnerable students, until \nFCPS accepts Defendants’ demands, leaves FCPS with no meaningful choice but to comply.  And \nthis is so even when acceptance of Defendants’ terms means that FCPS must surrender local \ncontrol over its lawful policies, violate state law, eschew controlling judicial precedent, and expose \nitself to liability for violating the rights of students under that precedent.  This funding threat \ncompels capitulation, not voluntary agreement.  See Medina, 145 S. Ct. at 2232 n. 4. \n  Because Defendants’ action is contrary to Congress’s constitutional power and to \nFCPS’s constitutional power reserved under the Tenth Amendment, Defendants’ action must be \nheld unlawful and set aside.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n  FCPS is separately entitled to a judicial declaration that Defendants’ action is \ncontrary to the federal government’s power under the Spending Clause.  28 U.S.C. § 2201. \nCount V – Ultra Vires \n(against Defendants McMahon and the Department) \n  FCSB repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–103 as though fully set forth herein. \n  An agency cannot take any action that exceeds the scope of its constitutional or \nstatutory authority. \n- 25 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 26 of 31 PageID# 26\n \n  Federal courts possess the power in equity to “grant injunctive relief . . . with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 326–27 (2015).  The Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed equitable relief against \nfederal officials who act “beyond th[e] limitations” imposed by federal statute.  Larson v. Domestic \n& Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949). \n  Defendants have no authority under the Constitution or any statute to demand that \nFCPS rescind Regulation 2603.2 based on their erroneous interpretation of Title IX in order for \nFCPS to receive federal funding.     \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), FCSB is entitled to a declaration that Defendants \nacted ultra vires by demanding that FCSB rescind its regulation in order for FCPS to receive \nfederal funding.     \nCount VI – under the Declaratory Judgment Act  \n(against Defendants McMahon and the Department) \n  FCSB repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–108 as though fully set forth herein. \n  An actual and justiciable controversy exists between the parties with respect to the \nenforceability of Grimm.  Defendants have asserted, and continue to assert, that Grimm has been \nabrogated, and therefore, FCPS’s implementation of Regulation 2603.2 is in violation of Title IX. \n  FCSB’s position—and that of the Fourth Circuit, see Doe, 2025 WL 2375386—is \nthat Grimm remains binding law in the Fourth Circuit and FCPS is bound to follow that law.  As \nsuch, Regulation 2603.2 is not only constitutional, but compelled by federal law. \n  Accordingly,  FCSB  and  Defendants  have adverse legal interests of sufficient \nimmediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment on the disputed matters \nraised herein.  \n- 26 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 27 of 31 PageID# 27\n \n  FCSB is therefore entitled to a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and Rule \n57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that Regulation 2603.2 does not violate Title IX. \n  FCSB is further entitled to a judicial declaration that Defendants’ action is arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor relief, FCSB requests that the Court: \na)  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2202, vacate and set aside Defendants’ \ndecision to designate FCPS as “high-risk”;  \nb)  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2202, vacate and set aside Defendants’ \naction constructively denying funds allocated to FCPS and any other further \nactions taken by Defendants to implement their freeze on federal funds allocated \nto FCPS; \nc)  Pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § 2201,  issue  a  judicial  declaration  that  Defendants’ \nconditioning and freezing of federal funds allocated to FCPS is an unlawful act \nviolative of the APA; \nd)  Pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § 2201,  issue  a  judicial  declaration  that  Defendants’ \nconditioning and freezing of federal funds allocated to FCPS is an unlawful act \nviolative of the Spending Clause; \ne)  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, issue a judicial declaration that the legal principles \nand holdings announced in Grimm and reaffirmed in the Fourth Circuit’s August \n15, 2025 Amended Order in Doe, 2025 WL 2375386, remain valid and binding \nlegal precedent; \nf)  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, issue a judicial declaration that Regulation 2603.2 \ndoes not violate Title IX; \n- 27 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 1     Filed 08/29/25     Page 28 of 31 PageID# 28\n \ng)  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, issue a judicial declaration that federal funds are not \nconditioned  on  compliance  with  Defendants’  demands,  including  prohibiting \nstudents from accessing facilities in accordance with their gender identity; \nh)  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  Defendants  (including  any  officers, \nemployees, and agents thereof) from taking enforcement action on the ground that \nRegulation 2603.2 violates Title IX; \ni)  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from conditioning, terminating, \nfreezing, or otherwise impeding access to federal funds allocated to FCPS based \non FCPS’s alleged violation of Title IX; \nj)  Require that Defendants immediately pay to FCPS any funds that have been \ndenied pursuant to Defendants’ August 19, 2025 letter, Ex.

McMahon (collectively, \n“Defendants”) from (1) designating FCPS as “high-risk” pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 200.208 and \n2 C.F.R. § 3474.10; and (2) requiring that all federal funding allocated to FCPS be done by \nreimbursement conditioned on compliance with Defendants’ demands, including prohibiting \nstudents from accessing facilities in accordance with their gender identity.2  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65; \n5 U.S.C. § 705.  This matter is pressing because Defendants have effectively blocked access to \n$167 million in federal funds that FCPS uses to provide breakfast and lunch to its students; support \nspecial education programs for students with disabilities; develop language proficiency programs; \ninvest in its teachers’ professional development; and ultimately provide a well-rounded education \nfor its students. \nOn  August  19,  2025,  Defendants  designated  FCPS  as  “high-risk”  pursuant  to \n2 C.F.R. § 200.208 and 2 C.F.R. § 3474.10, placing on FCPS a “specific condition” that all federal \nfunding flowing into FCPS be done by reimbursement.  Because Defendants have conditioned that \nreimbursement on a legally impossible requirement, Defendants have effectively terminated or \nrefused to continue to fund FCPS’s programs that provide food and nutrition services to students; \n \n1 Plaintiff Fairfax County School Board operates, maintains, and supervises Fairfax County Public \nSchools (“FCPS”). \n \n2 The Arlington School Board (“ASB”) has filed against Defendants a similar action and motion \nfor immediate issuance of a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.  Given the \nsimilar nature of the actions and motions, ASB and FCSB request that the two actions and motions \nbe consolidated. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 8 of 33 PageID# 124\n     \nsupport programs for students with disabilities; further education for English-language learners; \nand improve the quality, quantity, and effectiveness of FCPS’s teachers, principals, and other \nleaders.  Defendants did so based on their bare assertion that FCPS’s Regulation 2603.2 — a health \nand  welfare  policy  entitled  “Gender-expansive  and  Transgender  Students”  that  sets  forth \nprocedures and guidelines for schools to ensure that all students, including gender-expansive and \ntransgender students, experience a safe, supportive, and inclusive school environment — violates \nTitle IX.  Defendants’ actions in designating FCPS as “high-risk” and effectively freezing federal \nfunds are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law because they flout \nTitle IX precedent that is binding on this jurisdiction.  Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty Sch. Bd., \n972 F.3d 586, 619–20 (4th Cir. 2020).  If this funding freeze is not enjoined by this Court, FCSB \nwill  be  without  the  necessary  funding  to  meaningfully  carry  out  services  that  meet  the \naforementioned student needs. \nIn response, FCSB has filed this action and seeks emergency relief, including a temporary \nrestraining  order  and  a  preliminary  injunction  to  (1) de-designate  FCPS  as  “high-risk”  and \n(2) remove the condition requiring that federal funding due to FCSB be paid by reimbursement \nthat is subject to Defendants’ conditions.  In this lawsuit, FCSB seeks (1) review and vacatur under \nthe  APA  of  Defendants’  final  agency  actions  effectively  freezing  FCPS’s  funding,  see \n5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06; (2) a judicial declaration that FCPS’s Regulation 2603.2 does not violate \nTitle IX, see 28 U.S.C. § 2201; and (3) injunctive relief requiring Defendants to de-designate FCPS \nas “high-risk,” removing the condition requiring that federal funding due to FCPS be paid by \nreimbursement that is subject to Defendants’ conditions, and barring Defendants from designating \nFCPS as “high-risk” again. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 9 of 33 PageID# 125\n     \nFCSB is likely to prevail on the merits of its APA claim because Defendants’ actions are \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law.  Regulation 2603.2 codifies the \nFourth Circuit’s interpretation of Title IX as set forth in Grimm.  972 F.3d at 619–20.  There, the \nFourth Circuit clearly held that, under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, a school board \ncould not prohibit a student who identified as male from using a high school’s sex-separated male \nbathroom.  Grimm, 972 F.3d at 619–20.  Consistent with that holding, Regulation 2603.2 provides \ngender-expansive and transgender students with the “option of using a locker room or restroom \nconsistent with” either the student’s gender identity or the student’s sex assigned at birth.  Ex. A.  \nBecause Grimm remains binding precedent in the Fourth Circuit, FCSB is likely to succeed on \nboth its APA claim and its declaratory judgment claim that it is not in violation of Title IX.  Indeed, \non August 15, 2025, the Fourth Circuit expressly reaffirmed that Grimm remains the law in this \nCircuit.  Doe v. South Carolina, No. 25-1787, 2025 WL 2375386, at *8 (4th Cir. Aug. 15, 2025) \n(“Grimm remains the law of this Circuit and is thus binding on all the district courts within it.”).  \nMoreover, FCPS will be irreparably harmed in the absence of injunctive relief.  Without \nfederal funds, FCPS will be unable to provide critical services to students, including the following:  \n$61 million for food and nutrition services; $41 million to serve students with disabilities; and \n$65 million to help students overcoming challenges attendant with homelessness, low incomes, \nlearning English, and improving the quality, quantity, and effectiveness of FCPS’s teachers, \nprincipals, and other leaders.  Although those damages are economic, FCPS will not be able to \nrecover the funds through litigation against the federal government.  The balance of hardships and \npublic interest favor injunctive relief because Defendants would not be harmed by an order to pay \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 10 of 33 PageID# 126\n     \nfunds that the law requires them to provide FCPS and that Congress appropriated for that purpose.  \nAs such, FCSB is entitled to injunctive relief.3 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Statutory Background of Title IX \nUnder Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-318, “[n]o person \nin the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).   \nAs several federal Courts of Appeals—including the Fourth Circuit—have held, Title IX \ndoes not prohibit transgender students from accessing facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity even where that differs from the sex assigned them at birth.  See Grimm, 972 F.3d 586 at \n619; Parents for Priv. v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1227 (9th Cir. 2020); Doe ex rel. Doe v. Boyertown \nArea Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 533 (3d Cir. 2018); Whitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. \nDist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1046–50 (7th Cir. 2017), abrogated on other grounds as \nrecognized by, Ill. Republican Party v. Pritzker, 973 F.3d 760, 762 (7th Cir. 2020).4   \n \n3 Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) states:  “The court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary \nrestraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to \npay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained.”  However, the Court has discretion not to require a bond.  Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d \n307, 332 (4th Cir. 2013).  The Court should exercise that discretion here.  Defendants’ withholding \nof funds is clearly wrongful, and FCPS should not be required to put up security to receive what it \nis entitled to.   \n \n4 While the majority of courts who have considered the extent of Title IX protection of gender \nidentity have agreed with the Fourth Circuit’s holding in Grimm, some courts have declined to \nfind that Title IX allows transgender students to access facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity, thus creating a circuit split on this issue.  See Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., 104 F.4th 577, \n610–11 (6th Cir. 2024) (interpreting Title IX regulations “[w]ithout deciding any substantive \nmerits questions”); Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 816 (11th \nCir. 2022) (en banc) (restrooms under Title IX and Equal Protection). \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 11 of 33 PageID# 127\n     \nThe  Fourth  Circuit  has  clearly  and  unambiguously  held  that  under  both  the  Equal \nProtection Clause and Title IX, a school board may not bar a student from using a school’s sex-\nseparated bathroom corresponding to that student’s gender identity.  Grimm, 972 F.3d 586 at 619.  \nAnd as the Fourth Circuit has recently clarified, “Grimm remains the law of this Circuit and is thus \nbinding on all the district courts within it”—including this one.  Doe, 2025 WL 2375386, at *8.  \nGrimm is controlling here.5 \nB.  Defendants’ Regulations \nFederal agencies, including the Department, are “required to review the responsibility and \nqualification records” of recipients of federal funds before making certain awards of federal funds.  \n2 C.F.R. § 200.206(a)(1); 2 C.F.R. § 3474.1(a).  Fund recipients “must demonstrate a satisfactory \nrecord of administering programs or activities under Federal financial assistance” and if not, \nfederal  agencies  may  impose  “specific  conditions  that  can  appropriately  mitigate  the  risk \nassociated with the recipient in accordance with [2 C.F.R.] § 200.208.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.206(a)(2).  \nOne of the “specific conditions” that an agency may impose on a recipient of federal funds is a \nrequirement that payments be made as “reimbursements rather than advance payments.”  2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.208(c)(1).   \nC.  FCPS’s Regulation 2603.2 \nRegulation 2603.2 establishes “procedures and guidelines for schools [within FCPS] to \nensure that all students, including gender-expansive and transgender students[,] experience a safe, \n \n5 The Supreme Court has recently granted certiorari in B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board. of \nEducation, a case raising the question of whether Title IX restricts or protects access to athletic \nteams based on gender identity.  B.P.J. ex rel. Jackson v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ, 98 F.4th 542, \n565 (4th Cir. 2024), cert. granted sub nom. W. Virginia v. B.P.J., No. 24-43, 2025 WL 1829164, \nat *1 (July 3, 2025).  Depending on the scope of the Supreme Court’s ruling in B.P.J., it is \nconceivable that the circuit split could be resolved when the Court hears and decides that case in \nthe upcoming Supreme Court term.  \n \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 12 of 33 PageID# 128\n     \nsupportive, and inclusive school environment.”  Ex. A at 1.  Regulation 2603.2 is designed to \nensure that “[a]ll students have a right to privacy in [FCPS] facilities or while participating in \nFCPS sponsored events.”  Id.  Regulation 2603.2 was drafted to conform to the rule announced in \nthe Fourth Circuit’s Grimm decision, which held that both the Equal Protection Clause and Title \nIX barred a school board from prohibiting a student who identified as male from using a high \nschool’s sex-separated male bathroom.  972 F.3d at 619–20.  Accordingly, Regulation 2603.2 \nprovides that “[g]ender-expansive and transgender students shall be provided with the option of \nusing a locker room or restroom consistent with the student’s gender identity.”  Ex. A at 4.  The \nregulation further provides that such students may also “be provided with the option of using the \nfacilities that correspond to the student’s sex assigned at birth.”  Ex. A at 5. \nD.  FCPS Correspondence with the Defendants  \nOn February 12, 2025, the Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) of the Department issued a \nNotification Letter and Data Request Letter to FCPS asserting that a complaint had been filed \nalleging that FCPS’s policy regarding use of sex-segregated facilities such as restrooms and locker \nrooms (Regulation 2603.2) violated Title IX by providing greater rights to students who are \ntransgender than to those who are cisgender.  Ex. B; Ex. C.  On March 24, 2025, FCPS promptly \nresponded with documents and a narrative response defending the policy and citing Grimm and \nstate law for the protection of transgender students’ access to facilities aligned with their gender \nidentity.  Ex. D.   \nOn July 25, 2025, OCR concluded its investigation by issuing a Letter of Findings \n(“Findings Letter”).  Ex. E.  OCR asserted that the FCPS policies and similar facilities-access \npolicies for four other school divisions in Northern Virginia (those serving Arlington, Loudoun, \nPrince William, and Alexandria Counties) violate Title IX and its implementing regulations.  Id.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 13 of 33 PageID# 129\n     \nAccompanying the Findings Letter, OCR delivered a draft Resolution Agreement which requires \nthat each division (1) modify its policy to ensure that access to restroom and locker room facilities \nwill be limited by students’ sex assigned at birth; and (2) ensure that all policies adopt OCR’s \ndefinition  of  the  terms  “sex,  female,  male,  girls,  women,  boys  [and]  men,”  essentially \nmemorializing a rule that treats students exclusively according to the sex assigned them at birth.  \nEx. F.   \nOn July 29, 2025, counsel to the five impacted school divisions submitted a joint request \nto OCR for 90 days to respond to the July 25, 2025 Findings Letter, consistent with the timeframe \nfor negotiated resolutions provided in the OCR Case Processing Manual.  Ex. G.  On July 31, 2025, \nOCR’s Regional Director Bradley Burke rejected the July 29th request, imposing an August 15, \n2025 deadline for notice to OCR as to “whether or not [the Division] is willing to consider agreeing \nto the terms in the draft resolution agreement.”  Ex. H.   \nOn August 15, 2025, FCPS submitted a response letter to OCR, stating that FCPS was \nbound by Fourth Circuit precedent and could not modify its policies or agree to the terms of the \nResolution Agreement without violating federal and state law.  Ex. I.  Therein, FCPS proposed \nthat OCR pause its investigation until the Supreme Court has issued its decision in B.P.J., which \nmay provide further guidance on the interpretation of Title IX.  Id.   \nOn August 18, 2025, FCPS submitted a supplemental letter to OCR regarding the Fourth \nCircuit’s August 15, 2025 decision in Doe v. South Carolina, No. 25-1787, wherein the court made \nclear that Grimm remains good law and controls the issue of student restroom access in the Fourth \nCircuit.  See Ex. J; Doe, 2025 WL 2375386, at *8.  In its letter, FCSB explained to OCR that Doe \n“involves a challenge to a South Carolina statute that seeks to enforce a rule identical” to that \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 14 of 33 PageID# 130\n     \nwhich OCR had demanded FCPS implement:  specifically, a restriction on restroom access to \nstudents according to the sex assigned them at birth.  Id.   \nIn Doe, FCPS explained, a student challenged the South Carolina law and moved for a \npreliminary injunction against its enforcement.  Id.  The Fourth Circuit granted the plaintiff’s \npreliminary injunction motion, finding that (1) the plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of \nhis claim as the South Carolina statute was in direct conflict with the court’s prior ruling in Grimm; \n(2) the student would suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief; and (3) the balance of \nequities supported an injunction.  Id.  In its August 18, 2025 letter, FCPS further clarified that the \nFourth Circuit’s Doe order flatly states that “Grimm remains the law of this Circuit and is thus \nbinding on all the district courts within it,” thereby negating OCR’s prior position that Grimm had \nbeen abrogated by United States v. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025).  Id. (quoting Doe, 2025 WL \n2375386, slip. op. at *17).6   \nE.  Defendants Designate FCPS “High Risk” and Impose Reimbursement Special \nCondition \nOn August 19, 2025, Secretary McMahon sent FCPS a letter informing the school district \nthat the Department had designated FCPS as “a ‘high-risk’ entity, under all of the programs \nadministered  by  the  Department  for  which  [FCPS]  receives  funds,  in  accordance  with \n2 C.F.R. §§ 200.208 and 3474.10[.]”  Ex. K (“High-Risk Letter”) at 2.  McMahon specified that \nthis letter followed on the July 25, 2025 Findings Letter and FCPS’s August 15, 2025 response \nletter.  Id.; see also Ex. E; Ex. I.  McMahon claimed that in light of FCPS’s August 15, 2025 letter, \nshe and the Department found that FCPS “remains in noncompliance with Title IX[,]” and \ntherefore, the Department designated FCPS as a “high-risk” entity and required that all of the grant \n \n6 On August 28, 2025, the Defendants in Doe filed a petition for certiorari with the United States \nSupreme Court. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 15 of 33 PageID# 131\n     \nand subgrants that FCPS receives from the Department would be paid by reimbursement.  Ex. K \nat 1. \nSecretary McMahon also represented that “[r]epresentatives of the [Virginia Department \nof Education (“VDOE”)] have already agreed” to “take similar actions to those being taken by the \nDepartment with regard to [FCPS’s] funds.”  Id. at 2. \nARGUMENT \nFCSB  is  entitled  to  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  preliminary  injunction  under \nRule 65(a) because (1) FCSB is likely to succeed on the merits of its APA, declaratory judgment, \nand Spending Clause claims; (2) FCSB is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief; (3) the balance of hardships tips in FCSB’s favor; and (4) an injunction is in the \npublic interest.  Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. 6.56 Acres, 915 F.3d 197, 211 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(affirming grant of preliminary injunction motion); see Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008); see also Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. v. Coreth, 535 F. Supp. 3d 488, 501 \n(E.D. Va. 2021) (“The standard for granting either a TRO or a preliminary injunction is the \nsame.”).  \nI.  FCSB Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Its APA, Declaratory Judgment, and \nSpending Clause Claims. \nFCSB’s Complaint sets forth two legal bases for its claims against Defendants:  (1) that the \nDefendants’ actions should be set aside under the APA because Defendants, in an arbitrary, \ncapricious, and unlawful manner, designated FCPS as a high-risk entity and required that FCPS \nreceive all grant funds from the Department on a reimbursement basis; and (2) that declaratory \njudgment is warranted because FCPS’s Regulation 2603.2 does not violate Title IX, despite \nDefendants’ claims to the contrary.  To meet the likelihood-of-success element, FCSB “‘need not \nshow a certainty of success’” on the merits; a demonstration of likely success is sufficient.  League \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 16 of 33 PageID# 132\n     \nof Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Pashby, \n709 F.3d at 321).  Moreover, showing a likelihood of success on any of FCSB’s claims suffices to \njustify injunctive relief.  See Salomon & Ludwin, LLC v. Winters, No. 24-1728, 2025 WL 2314562, \nat *3 n.1 (4th Cir. Aug. 12, 2025). \nBecause  the  federal  funds  that  Defendants  have  effectively  frozen  are  essential  for \nprograms that provide students with food and nutrition services and increase student achievement, \nimmediate action is needed.  For the reasons that follow, a preliminary injunction is warranted \nbecause FCSB is likely to prevail on its APA and declaratory judgment claims. \nA.  FCSB’s APA and Ultra Vires Claims (Counts I-V) Are Likely to Succeed on \nthe Merits. \nFCSB will likely succeed on the merits of its APA claims.  Defendants’ actions in \n“terminating or refusing to . . . continue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply \nwith” Title IX are subject to judicial review under the APA.  20 U.S.C. § 1683.  Under the APA, \nthis Court must “hold unlawful and set aside” any challenged final agency action that is “arbitrary, \ncapricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.”    See \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Here, because Defendants’ actions are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, and contrary to law, this Court will likely hold unlawful and set aside Defendants’ \nactions. \n1.  Defendants’ actions are final agency actions reviewable under the APA. \n“[A]gency action includes the whole or part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, \nrelief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13) (internal quotations \nomitted).  Such an action is “final” when (1) it “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process” and (2) is one “by which rights or obligations have been determined or \nfrom which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 17 of 33 PageID# 133\n     \n(cleaned up).  Finality for the purpose of judicial review “entails a ‘pragmatic’ and ‘flexible’ \ninquiry that ‘lacks many self-implementing, bright-line rules’ and ‘is hardly crisp.’”  Nat’l Council \nof Agric. Emp.s v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 143 F.4th 395, 410 (D.C. Cir. 2025) (quoting Rhea Lana, \nInc. v. Dep’t of Labor, 824 F.3d 1023, 1027 (D.C. Cir. 2016).   \nHere, Defendants’ August 19, 2025 letter designating FCPS as “high-risk” and requiring \nthat FCPS receive federal funds by reimbursement satisfy all those requirements.  This letter \nconstitutes an agency action that is “not . . . of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature” but that \nreflects  the  conclusion  of  the  Department’s  decision-making  process,  however  stunted  and \nmisguided that process may have been, concerning the imposition of specific conditions on FCPS’s \nfunding.  See id.  Moreover, the Department’s action was one “by which rights or obligations have \nbeen determined,” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78, because it “had an immediate and practical \nimpact,” Frozen Food Express v. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 43–44 (1956), imposing binding \nobligations on FCSB to either rescind Regulation 2603.2 in violation of federal law or access \nfederal funding it has previously been entitled to, and to undertake other onerous tasks, including \ndevelopment and submission of “plans for compliance with all federal laws” Ex. K (emphasis \nadded) of which there are quite a large number.  As the Fourth Circuit has explained in the context \nof ripeness for judicial review, “impos[ing] new conditions” on actions even absent a “formal \nadministrative order” are final agency actions.  Arch Mineral Corp. v. Babbitt, 104 F.3d 660, 667 \n(4th Cir. 1997).  Here, it is through a formal administrative order—the August 19th letter—that \nthose conditions have been imposed.  \nFurther, under the properly “pragmatic and flexible inquiry,” the Department’s actions \nhave the practical effect of terminating federal funding for FCPS, because they impose on FCSB \na legally impossible condition.  See City of New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 913 F.3d 423, 431 (4th \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 18 of 33 PageID# 134\n     \nCir. 2019); see also Maryland v. Corp. for Nat’l & Cmty. Serv., No. DLB-25-1363, 2025 WL \n1585051, at *14 (D. Md. June 5, 2025) (administration’s closure of AmeriCorps was a final agency \naction because state “grantees no longer receive funding”).   \n2.  Defendants’ actions should be set aside because they reflect an erroneous \ninterpretation of Title IX. \na.  FCSB will likely be successful on its APA claim (Count I) because Defendants’ actions \nreflect a clearly erroneous interpretation of binding law.  As a result, those actions are arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nDefendants  demand  that  FCPS  adhere  to  their  interpretation  of  Title  IX  and  have \ndesignated FCPS a “high-risk” entity and required that FCPS receive federal funds only through \nreimbursement, thereby effectively cutting off FCPS’s federal funding.  But FCPS, this Court, and \nDefendants when acting within Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and both Carolinas are all \nbound not by Defendants’ chosen interpretation of Title IX, but by that of the Fourth Circuit.  And \non this point, the Fourth Circuit has spoken clearly:  Title IX does not forbid policies like \nRegulation 2603.2; it requires them.  Grimm, 972 F.3d at 619–20.  There is no plausible argument \nthat Grimm has been overruled by either an intervening en banc Fourth Circuit decision or \nintervening Supreme Court authority.  See Gibbons v. Gibbs, 99 F.4th 211, 213 (4th Cir. 2024) \n(“When a panel of this Court decides a legal issue in a published opinion, that ruling is binding on \nall future panels and district courts within this circuit unless it is abrogated by the Supreme Court \nor an en banc decision of this Court.”).  Defendants’ desire for a contrary interpretation of Title IX \ndoes not trump Grimm, which clearly controls here.  Id. (noting that the controlling nature of a \npublished opinion “does not disappear just because a future litigant identifies a fact, theory, or line \nof argument the previous panel could have but did not consider”). \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 19 of 33 PageID# 135\n     \nEven if there had been such an argument, the Fourth Circuit recently issued an express \nholding that Grimm continues to bind this Court and all other Courts in this Circuit.  In Doe v. \nSouth  Carolina,  the  Fourth  Circuit  emphatically  rejected  the  District  of  South  Carolina’s \ncharacterization of Grimm as “unsettled” precedent.  See 2025 WL 2375386, at *3.  In Doe, South \nCarolina predicted that because the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in West Virginia v. \nB.P.J., No. 24-43 (S. Ct.), Grimm or its premises would be overruled in the decision in that case.  \nSee Doe, 2025 WL 2375386, at *9.  But as the Fourth Circuit explained, “[w]e do not know what \nthe Supreme Court will say—or not say—in any future decision in B.P.J.” and accordingly “have \nno reason to know how or in what way its holding will impact Grimm’s precedential value.”  Id.  \nAccordingly, the court stated in no uncertain terms that “Grimm remains the law of this Circuit \nand is thus binding on all the district courts within it.”  Id. at *8. \nb.  As the Supreme Court has explained, “[t]he APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard \nrequires that agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio \nProject, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).  Where an agency fails to “articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made[,]” then \nits decision may be found to be arbitrary and capricious.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  “A material \nmisapprehension of the baseline conditions existing in advance of an agency action can lay the \ngroundwork” for a court to find it was arbitrary and capricious.  Friends of Back Bay v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs, 681 F.3d 581, 588 (4th Cir. 2012). \nDefendants’ freezing of FCPS’s funds was neither reasonable nor reasonably explained.  \nDefendants’  actions  were  unreasonable  because  Defendants  purported  to  require  FCPS  to \nimplement a policy that would violate binding Fourth Circuit law.  See Ex. K; Ex. E.  FCPS \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 20 of 33 PageID# 136\n     \nproposed that Defendants stay any action at least until the Court decides B.P.J.  Ex. I.  But without \nexplanation, Defendants refused the proposed stay, designated FCPS as “high-risk,” and required \nthat  FCPS  receive  federal  funds  by  reimbursement—an  unreasonable  choice  that  was  not \nreasonably explained to FCPS, and thus, arbitrary and capricious.  See Ex. K. \nMoreover, Defendants’ actions are not reasonable, and therefore arbitrary and capricious, \nbecause  they  have  singled  out  FCPS  (and  four  other  Northern  Virginia  schools)  based  on \nRegulation 2603.2, despite the fact that other similarly situated school districts in Virginia and \nacross the nation have policies similar to Regulation 2603.2.  Defendants have not explained—let \nalone reasonably explained—why FCPS (and other select schools) are to be designated high risk \nand be subject to certain conditions, while other school districts are not.  This disparate treatment, \nwithout a rational basis, violates the fundamental principal that agency action must be based on \nreasoned decision-making.  Kirk v. Comm’r of SSA, 987 F.3d 314, 321 (4th Cir. 2021) (citing \nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 403 F.3d 771, 777 (D.C. Cir. 2005) \n(“Where an agency applies different standards to similarly situated entities and fails to support this \ndisparate treatment with a reasoned explanation and substantial evidence in the record, its action \nis arbitrary and capricious and cannot be upheld.”)).  Agency discretion is not unbounded, and \nselective enforcement without justification renders Defendants’ action arbitrary and capricious and \nan abuse of discretion.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \nFurther, Defendants plainly “misapprehen[ded] [] the baseline conditions existing” in the \nFourth Circuit “in advance of [their] action.”  See Friends of Back Bay, 681 F.3d at 588.  Those \nconditions included not just the Fourth Circuit’s holding in Grimm but its subsequent express \nreaffirmance that Grimm remains good law in the Fourth Circuit.  See Doe, 2025 WL 2375386, at \n*8; see also Ex. J.    \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 21 of 33 PageID# 137\n     \nThat same fundamental legal error also justifies ruling that Defendants’ actions constituted \nan abuse of discretion.  An agency abuses its discretion when its “decision is based on an improper \nunderstanding of the law.”  Pappas v. FCC, 807 F.2d 1019, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (quoting Jaimez-\nRevolla v. Bell, 598 F.2d 243, 246 (D.C. Cir. 1979)).  A proper understanding of the relevant law \nwould necessarily recognize that the Fourth Circuit’s holding binds FCPS.  Defendants’ contrary \ncontention cannot be considered anything but “improper.”  Id. \nAnd, of course, Defendants’ demand that FCPS obey Defendants and not the Fourth Circuit \nis contrary to law.  “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what \nthe law is.”  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis added).  It is, by \ncontrast, the duty of the Executive—of which Defendants are mere organs—to “take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. Art. II § 3.  What Defendants demand here is abrogation \nof the law, not its faithful execution—and their actions are thus contrary to both of those \nfoundational principles. \nBecause Defendants’ actions were arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not \nin accordance with law, FCSB is likely to succeed on its APA claim, as set forth in Count I of the \nComplaint.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n3.  Defendants’ actions must also be set aside because they are contrary to \nDefendants’ constitutional power. \nFCSB will also likely be successful on its APA and ultra vires claims set forth in Counts \nII–V.  This Court must set aside agency actions that are “contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  “[T]he ‘Federal Government may not compel the \nStates to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.’”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, \n567 U.S. 519, 575 (2012) (quoting New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 188 (1992)).  Congress \nmay, as an exercise of its authority under the Spending Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1, \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 22 of 33 PageID# 138\n     \ncondition the receipt of federal funds on states’ “taking certain actions that Congress could not \nrequire them to take,” Sebelius, 567 U.S. at 576 (quoting College Savings Bank v. Fla. Prepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 686 (1999)).  Nevertheless, Congress may not, \nconsistent with that authority, “commandeer[] a State’s legislative or administrative apparatus for \nfederal purposes.”  Id. at 577. \nAnd of course if Congress may not pass laws that “commandeer[] a State’s legislative or \nadministrative apparatus,” the Executive may not execute Congress’s laws in such a fashion.  Id.  \nThe President’s sole Constitutional authority with respect to the laws of the United States is to \n“take care that [they] be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. art. II, § 3.  In short, when executing \nfederal laws, what is ultra vires of Congress is similarly ultra vires of the President.  Instead, the \nStates and the people retain those powers.  U.S. Const. Amend. X. \nHere, the Department—a mere appendage of the Executive—is engaged in exactly the kind \nof “economic dragooning” the Supreme Court has forbidden, leaving FCPS and other Virginia \nschools “with no real option but to acquiesce” in the Department’s regulatory interpretation of \nTitle IX.  See Sebelius, 567 U.S. at 582.  By cutting off over $160 million in federal funding and \nseparately threatening the Commonwealth so that it, too, cuts off funding to FCPS and other \nNorthern  Virginia  school  divisions,  the  Department  seeks  not  to  “mild[ly]  encourage[],” \nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987), but to compel those divisions to “administer” the \nDepartment’s illegal-in-the-Fourth-Circuit regulatory program barring transgender individuals \nfrom accessing facilities that correspond with their gender identities, see New York, 505 U.S. at \n188. \nBecause  that  attempted  coercion  is  contrary  to  Virginia’s  and  its  people’s  reserved \nconstitutional power under the Tenth Amendment, FCSB will likely be successful on the APA \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 23 of 33 PageID# 139\n     \nclaims set forth in Counts II–V as this Court will likely hold unlawful the Department’s actions \nand set them aside.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).   \nB.  FCSB’s Declaratory Judgment Claim (Count VI) Is Likely to Succeed on the \nMerits. \nIt also is likely that FCSB will succeed on the merits of its declaratory judgment claim \nbecause (1) the court may properly exercise jurisdiction over FCSB’s declaratory judgment claim; \nand (2) FCSB can likely show that Regulation 2603.2 does not violate Title IX. \n1.  The Court may properly exercise jurisdiction over FCSB’s declaratory \njudgment claim. \nFederal courts may exercise jurisdiction over declaratory judgment claims when the \nfollowing three elements are satisfied: \n(1) the complaint alleges an actual controversy between the parties of sufficient \nimmediacy and reality to warrant issuance of a declaratory judgment; (2) the court \npossesses  an  independent  basis  for  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  (e.g.,  federal \nquestion or diversity jurisdiction); and (3) the court does not abuse its discretion in \nits exercise of jurisdiction. \nVolvo Const. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co., Inc., 386 F.3d 581, 592 (4th Cir. 2004) \n(internal quotations and citations omitted); 28 U.S.C. § 2201.  Each of these elements is easily \nsatisfied here. \nFirst,  the  Complaint  alleges  an  actual  controversy  between  the  parties  of  sufficient \nimmediacy  and  reality  such  that  the  issuance  of  a  declaratory  judgment  is  appropriate.  \nSee generally Compl.  The Complaint sets forth APA claims alongside the declaratory-judgment \nclaim, asserting that Defendants’ actions are due to be vacated under the APA by designating FCPS \nas “high-risk” and requiring that FCPS receive federal funds only through reimbursement, thereby \neffectively freezing FCPS’s funds, all based on an interpretation of Title IX that is fundamentally \ninconsistent with the interpretation that binds FCPS and this Court.  See generally id.  These claims \nstem from an actual, immediate, and real controversy between the parties:  here, Defendants stifled \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 24 of 33 PageID# 140\n     \nFCPS’s access to federal funds because they (wrongly) claimed that FCPS’s Regulation 2603.2 \nviolates Title IX.  As a result, Defendants have hampered FCPS’s ability to fund important \nprograms that provide invaluable services to students including food and nutrition services and \nservices to increase student achievement.  \nSecond, this Court has an independent basis for jurisdiction over the parties.  FCSB’s \nclaims arise under the “laws . . . of the United States,” 28 U.S.C. § 1331—specifically, the APA \n(5 U.S.C. § 706) and Title IX.  See Compl. ¶¶ 2, 66–115.  As such, this case presents questions of \nfederal law and this Court, therefore, has jurisdiction.   \nThird, exercising jurisdiction in the instant matter would not constitute an abuse of \ndiscretion.  While district courts may decline to entertain an action despite having declaratory-\njudgment jurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit has determined that a court may only do so if the court \nhas “good reason for declining to exercise [] declaratory judgment jurisdiction.”  Volvo, 386 F.3d \nat 594 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  The Fourth Circuit has opined that district courts \nsitting in its Circuit are “obliged to rule on the merits of a declaratory judgment action when \ndeclaratory relief will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue, \nand will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to \nthe proceeding.”  Volvo, 386 F.3d at 594 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nA ruling on the merits of the instant dispute would clarify and settle the legal relations \nbetween Defendants and FCSB and would afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and \ncontroversy underlying this proceeding.  A declaration affirming that Regulation 2603.2 does not \nviolate Title IX would settle the legal issues underlying Defendants’ erroneous and dangerous \ndecision to attach unsatisfiable conditions to FCPS’s federal funding. \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 25 of 33 PageID# 141\n     \n2.  Regulation 2603.2 does not violate Title IX. \nFCSB is likely to succeed on the merits of its Title IX claim because it can demonstrate \nthat Regulation 2603.2 does not violate Title IX.  In Grimm, the Fourth Circuit held that Title IX \nbars a school board from prohibiting a student who identified as male from using a high school’s \nsex-separated male bathroom.  972 F.3d at 619–20.  Regulation 2603.2 implements that holding.  \nSee Ex. A at 1, 4–5. \nFor school districts like FCPS that sit in the Fourth Circuit, Grimm is binding authority.  \nThough Defendants contended that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Skrmetti abrogated Grimm, the \nFourth Circuit expressly rejected that contention in Doe, 2025 WL 2375386, at *10.   \nIn Skrmetti, the Supreme Court considered whether a Tennessee law that prohibited certain \nmedical interventions and procedures for minors with “gender dysphoria” was constitutional under \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1824.  The Court upheld the Tennessee law, \nfinding that the law did not involve a classification “based on sex” or transgender status.  Id. at \n1837.  As such, the Court applied rational-basis review to the law and found it supported by the \nlegislature’s policy goal of protecting public health.  Id. at 1835–37.   \nNotably, Skrmetti did not address key issues at stake here or in Grimm.  For one, Skrmetti \ninvolved medical care available to children—a much different factual context than facilities access \naccording to gender identity.  Id.at 1824.  Second, the Court’s consideration of the Tennessee law \nat issue in Skrmetti involved a Constitutional challenge rather than a Title IX claim.  Id..  The \nSkrmetti plaintiffs did not bring Title IX claims and the facts did not involve any educational \nsetting.  Id.at 1824, 1826–28.  Finally, Skrmetti did not address whether transgender status is a \nprotected class.  See generally id..  The Court expressly stated that the law at issue in Skrmetti did \nnot classify on the basis of transgender status because it prohibited healthcare providers from \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 26 of 33 PageID# 142\n     \nadministering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of the \nminor’s sex, thereby leaving the question of whether transgender status is a protected class \nunanswered.  Id. at 1829.  Skrmetti is therefore factually and legally distinct from the policies at \nissue here, which involve student access to facilities. \nBut to the extent doubt remained about Grimm’s continued force following Skrmetti, the \nCourt of Appeals expressly considered and just as expressly rejected the notion that Grimm had \nbeen overruled.  Doe, 2025 WL 2375386, at *9.  Judge Diaz, moreover, explained in his \nconcurrence that “[t]he [Supreme] Court’s decision in United States v. Skrmetti . . . has little to say \nabout the issues Grimm addressed.”  Id. at *10 (Diaz, J., concurring).  As particular examples, \nJudge Diaz explained that:  \nGrimm’s conclusion that heightened constitutional scrutiny applies to a \nprohibition on transgender students’ use of gender-affirming restrooms \nremains good law.  As does Grimm’s holding that transgender people are \nat least a quasi-suspect class . . . .  And Skrmetti said nothing whatsoever \nto cause doubt as to the vitality of Grimm’s Title IX holding. \nId. (citation omitted; emphasis added).  Thus, “Grimm remains the law of this Circuit.”  Id. at *8. \nMoreover, this case is more akin to Bostock v. Clayton County, wherein the Supreme Court \nheld that firing someone for being gay or transgender “necessarily intentionally discriminates \nagainst that individual in part because of sex” in violation of Title VII.  590 U.S. 644, 646 (2020).  \nRegulation  2603.2  necessarily  involves  a  classification  based  on  sex,  much  like  the  hiring \nrestrictions at issue in Bostock.  See Ex. A (“Gender-expansive and transgender students shall be \nprovided with the option of using a locker room or restroom consistent with the student’s gender \nidentity.”).  And it is of no consequence that Bostock decided a Title VII violation as opposed to \none under Title IX.  Title VII and Title IX have been interpreted in a consistent manner.  See, e.g., \nJennings v. Univ. of North Carolina, 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007) (“We look to case law \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 27 of 33 PageID# 143\n     \ninterpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for guidance in evaluating a claim brought \nunder Title IX.”); Gossett v. Oklahoma ex rel. Bd. of Regents for Langston Univ., 245 F.3d 1172, \n1176 (10th Cir. 2001) (“Courts have generally assessed Title IX discrimination claims under the \nsame legal analysis as Title VII claims.”). \nAt bottom, it is likely that FCSB will succeed on the merits of its Declaratory Judgment \nclaim because Regulation 2603.2 adheres to Title IX and the binding precedent established in \nGrimm.  972 F.3d at 619–20. \nII.  FCSB Will Suffer Irreparable Harm in the Absence of Injunctive Relief. \nIf emergency relief is not granted, hungry children will not be fed and FCPS will be without \nresources to meaningfully serve some of its most vulnerable student populations, including those \nwho are disabled, are experiencing homelessness, come from low-income households, and are \novercoming language barriers.  See Compl. ¶ 61.  The school year has now begun, and with its \nstart, Defendants have pulled FCPS’s federal funding, placing in jeopardy key programs that are \nessential to students’ development.  See id.  In light of Defendants’ decision to effectively freeze \nfederal funding to FCPS, FCPS is without $167 million in federal funds earmarked to ensure that \nstudents have a successful 2025–2026 school year.  Id.  Defendants’ decision has stripped FCPS \nof $61 million in federal funds that the school district needs to provide food and nutrition services, \nprovide low-income students with free and reduced price meals, and ensure that FCPS’s cafeterias \nare operating efficiently so that FCPS can feed its students high-quality meals.  Id.  Defendants \nhave chosen to withhold an additional $41 million in federal funds designated to support students \nwith disabilities, as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  Id.  Defendants \nhave also effectively frozen $65 million that had been allocated to support FCPS students’ \nacademic achievement.  Id.  Defendants’ unfounded decision to strip FCPS of these resources has \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 28 of 33 PageID# 144\n     \nimplications that will likely have a lasting effect on the many FCPS students who depend on the \nprograms that these federal grants make possible.   \nAnd while the harms FCPS faces may be considered economic, “economic damages may \nconstitute irreparable harm where no remedy is available at the conclusion of litigation.”  Mt. \nValley Pipeline, LLC v. W. Pocahontas Props. Ltd. P’ship, 918 F.3d 353, 366 (4th Cir. 2019).  \nHere,  the  harm  is  irreparable  because  money  damages  are  unavailable  against  the  federal \ngovernment due to the government’s sovereign immunity.  See City of New York 913 F.3d at 430 \n(“The APA waives the federal government’s sovereign immunity for a limited set of suits, brought \nby ‘a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action’ to obtain relief ‘other than money \ndamages.’” (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702) (emphasis added)).   \nIII.  The Balance of Hardships and Public Interest Favor Injunctive Relief. \nThe balance of hardships and public interest also strongly favor injunctive relief.  In \nconsidering the balance of hardships, courts “balance the competing claims of injury and must \nconsider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.”  Winter, \n555 U.S. at 24 (citation omitted).  “Where, as here, the government is a party, the balance of \nequities and public interest prongs of the preliminary injunction test merge.”  Doe v. Hanover Cnty. \nSch. Bd., No. 3:24-cv-293, Slip Op. at 11, 38 (E.D. Va. Aug. 16, 2024) (cleaned up) (granting \nplaintiff’s preliminary injunction motion and enjoining the school board defendants from enforcing \na board policy and any other law, policy, or custom that prohibited plaintiff—a transgender girl—\nfrom trying out for and playing on her middle school’s girl’s tennis team).   \nHere, the harm to FCSB far outweighs any potential harm to Defendants and weighs \nheavily in favor of injunctive relief.  The public interests at issue here include providing students \nserved by FCPS with a fully funded educational experience, as guaranteed by the Virginia \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 29 of 33 PageID# 145\n     \nConstitution.  See Va. Const. Art. VIII § 1.  As do school districts across the country, FCPS relies \non federal funding to meet its obligations to its students, including by providing students with food \nand nutrition services and implementing programing to increase students’ academic achievement.  \nFCPS cannot satisfy that interest if it is denied the funds that Defendants have frozen. \nConversely, preliminary injunctive relief would not harm Defendants.  “The rationale \nbehind a grant of a preliminary injunction has been explained as preserving the status quo so that \nthe court can render a meaningful decision after a trial on the merits.”  Doe v. Wood Cnty. Bd. of \nEduc., 888 F. Supp. 2d 771, 778 (S.D. W. Va. 2012) (citations omitted).  If an injunction were \ngranted, the status quo would indeed be preserved:  Defendants would be required to continue to \nprovide funds to FCPS that make key FCPS programming possible. \nAs appendages of the Executive branch, Defendants inherit the President’s duty to “take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. Art. II § 3.  Where, as here, the “judicial \ndepartment” has issued a binding statement about “what the law is,” Marbury, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) \nat 177, the Executive can have no protectable interest in anything other than the faithful execution \nof that statement. \nMoreover, “[c]ompliance with Title IX,” an important and well-established federal civil \nrights statute, is in the public interest.  Wood, 888 F. Supp. 2d at 778; Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. \nSch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 729 (4th Cir. 2016) (Davis, J., concurring) (“Enforcing [plaintiff’s] right \nto be free from discrimination on the basis of sex in an educational institution is clearly in the \npublic interest”), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 580 U.S. 1168 (2017).  Indeed, because \nDefendants’ purported justification for their actions is enforcement of Title IX, they can scarcely \nargue otherwise.  But as explained above (supra, p. 2–3, 12–13), Regulation 2603.2 codifies \nbinding Fourth Circuit authority interpreting Title IX.   \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432     Document 3     Filed 08/29/25     Page 30 of 33 PageID# 146\n     \nSome future change in the law may provide Defendants with an opportunity to reassert \ntheir demands.  But as the law stands today, Defendants’ actions are flatly illegal and should be \nenjoined. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above,  FCSB  respectfully  requests  that  this  Court  grant  its \nemergency  motion  for  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  preliminary  injunction  and  enjoin \nDefendants and their officers, employees, agents, and any other person acting under Defendants’ \ndirection, supervision, or control, from designating FCPS as “high-risk” and requiring that FCPS \nreceive reimbursement of federal funds conditioned on compliance with Defendants’ demands, \nincluding prohibiting students from accessing facilities in accordance with their gender identity. \nDated: August 29, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Timothy Heaphy \n \nTimothy Heaphy \nWILLKIE FARR & GALLAGHER LLP \n1875 K Street Northwest \nWashington, District of Columbia 20006-1238 \nTel:  (202) 303-1000 \ntheaphy@willkie.com \nVirginia State Bar I.D.

FCSB, Dkt. 1 at 1 n.2; ASB, Dkt. 1 at 1 n.2.  Defendants have consented \nto this consolidation.  Accordingly, for good cause shown and by the express agreement of the parties to the litigation, \nthe Court exercises its discretion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a)(2) to consolidate these actions and \nwill address the Motions together. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 2 of 13 PageID# 443\nDkt. 3; ASB, Dkt. 3, Plaintiffs’ Declarations, FCSB, Dkt. 16; ASB, Dkt. 17, Defendants’2 Oppositions, \nFCSB, Dkt. 19; ASB, Dkt. 19, the parties’ arguments at the hearing held by the Court on September 3, \n2025, Defendants’ Notices Regarding Factual Background, FCSB, Dkt. 26; ASB, Dkt. 25, and \nPlaintiffs’  Replies,  FCSB,  Dkt.  27;  ASB,  Dkt.  26,  the  Court  DENIES  Plaintiffs’  Motions  and \nDISMISSES the Complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, pursuant to the Tucker \nAct, jurisdiction appropriately lies with the Court of Federal Claims for the reasons that follow.   \nI. BACKGROUND \n  This case arises out of Defendant United States Department of Education’s (the “Department”) \nAugust 19, 2025 placement of Fairfax County Public Schools (“FCPS”) and Arlington Public Schools \n(“APS”) “on high-risk status[] with the result that all Department funds . . . will be done by \nreimbursement only.”  FCSB, Dkt. 1 ¶ 1; ASB, Dkt. 1 ¶ 1.  According to Plaintiffs, to support this \n“high-risk status,” “Defendants assert that [FCPS and APS] violate[] Title IX by maintaining a policy \nthat permits students to access restrooms and locker rooms . . . that align with their gender identity.”  \nFCSB, Dkt. 1 ¶ 2; ASB, Dkt. 1 ¶ 2. \n   On Friday, August 29, 2025, Plaintiffs, who operate, maintain, and supervise FCPS and APS, \nfiled suit in this Court, alleging six claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)-(B), and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201.  FCSB, Dkt. 1; ASB, Dkt. 1.  \nAt  the  same  time,  Plaintiffs  also  filed  Emergency  Motions  for  Preliminary  Injunctions  and/or \nTemporary Restraining Orders.  FCSB, Dkt. 2; ASB, Dkt. 2.  Both cases were assigned to this judge at \napproximately 4:30 p.m. on Friday, August 29, 2025, and the Court, despite the intervening national \nLabor Day Holiday, promptly set a hearing on the Motions for the following Wednesday, September \n3, at 9:00 a.m. given the emergency nature of the Motions. \n \n2 Defendants are Linda McMahon, in her official capacity as Secretary of Education of the United States, and \nthe United States Department of Education. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 3 of 13 PageID# 444\n  On Tuesday, September 2, at approximately 4:30 p.m., Defendants filed Notices indicating \nthat, due to the Labor Day weekend, necessary federal personnel were unavailable and that Oppositions \nto the Motions would be forthcoming.  FCSB, Dkt. 15; ASB, Dkt. 16.  That same day, Plaintiffs filed \nDeclarations in support of the Motions.  FCSB, Dkt. 16; ASB, Dkt. 17.  At approximately 11:30 p.m. \non the same day, Defendants filed their Oppositions.  FCSB, Dkt. 19; ASB, Dkt. 19. \n  On Wednesday, September 3, at 9:00 a.m., the Court held the hearing on the Motions, the \nparties presented argument, and the Court took the matter under advisement.  FCSB, Dkt. 22; ASB, \nDkt. 21.  Later that day, at approximately 5:00 p.m., Defendants filed a Notice to correct a factual \ninaccuracy asserted in their Oppositions and at the hearing.3  FCSB, Dkt. 26; ASB, Dkt. 25.   \n  On Thursday, September 4, at approximately 12:00 p.m., Plaintiffs filed Replies in support of \ntheir Motions.  FCSB, Dkt. 27; ASB, Dkt. 26. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nIn their Motions, Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders—each \n“an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 24 (2008).  Such a request “involv[es] the exercise of a very far-reaching power to be granted \nonly sparingly and in limited circumstances.”  Sarsour v. Trump, 245 F. Supp. 3d 719, 728 (E.D. Va. \n2017).  To be eligible for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate each of the following factors by a “clear showing”: (1) a likelihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief; (3) the balance of equities \nbetween the parties tips in favor of the party seeking such relief; and (4) the public interest favors \nequitable relief.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20, 22.  As particularly relevant to the Court’s analysis here, the \nrequirement for showing a clear likelihood of success on the merits “is far stricter than a requirement \n \n3 During the hearing, Defendants had asserted that Plaintiffs had failed to file a request for reconsideration.  \nAfter  the  hearing,  Defendants  reported  that  they  discovered  that  Plaintiffs’  request  for  the  Department’s \nreconsideration had been “caught by a spam filter.”  FCSB, Dkt. 26 at 1; ASB, Dkt. 25 at 1. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 4 of 13 PageID# 445\nthat the [moving party] demonstrate only a grave or serious question for litigation.”  Sarsour, 245 F. \nSupp. 3d at 729 (cleaned up).  Fundamentally, as is the case with any action filed in a federal district \ncourt, a federal court “generally may not rule on the merits of a case without first determining that it \nhas jurisdiction over the category of claim in suit (subject-matter jurisdiction).”  Sinochem Int’l Co. \nLtd. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-31 (2007) (internal citation omitted).   \nIII. ANALYSIS \n  The parties’ briefing and oral argument raised a number of legal issues.  In their Motions, \nPlaintiffs address the merits of their requests for injunctive relief and rely primarily on the Fourth \nCircuit’s precedent in Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, 972 F.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020).  This \nCourt unconditionally recognizes that Grimm “remains the law of this Circuit” and thus binds both this \nCourt and parties within the Fourth Circuit.  Doe v. South Carolina, 2025 WL 2375386, at *8 (4th Cir. \nAug. 15, 2025).  In their Oppositions, however, Defendants raise the threshold question of this Court’s \nsubject matter jurisdiction.  Under controlling Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit precedent, this Court \nlacks subject matter jurisdiction.  Thus, this Court “may not rule on the merits” of the questions raised \nby Plaintiffs.  Sinochem Int’l, 549 U.S. at 430. \nA.  Whether the Court Has Jurisdiction to Provide the Relief Requested in the Motions \n \nEarlier this year, in Department of Education v. California, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates granted a stay of a federal district court order4 which had (1) enjoined the Department from \nterminating various education-related grants and (2) required the Department to pay out past-due grant \nobligations and continue paying obligations as they accrued.  145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025).  In so doing, \nthe Supreme Court held that the Department was likely to succeed in showing that the district court \n“lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” because “[t]he APA’s waiver of \nsovereign immunity does not apply ‘if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or \n \n4 The order was styled as a temporary restraining order; however, the Court construed the order as an \nappealable preliminary injunction.  Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 5 of 13 PageID# 446\nimpliedly forbids the relief which is sought.’”  Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  While the Supreme Court \nrecognized that “a district court’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order setting \naside  an  agency’s  action  may  result  in  the  disbursement  of  funds,”  id.  (quoting  Bowen  v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910 (1988)), “the APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend to \norders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’ along the lines of what the district court \nordered.”  Id.  Rather, “the Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based \non ‘any express or implied contract with the United States.’”  Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)). \nDespite  the  recency  of  the  California  decision,  the  Fourth  Circuit  has  already  applied \nCalifornia in other cases.  In Sustainability Institute v. Trump, the Fourth Circuit granted a stay of a \ndistrict court order requiring the Government “to restore [the plaintiffs’] access to grant funds \nimmediately” and prohibiting the Government from “freezing, terminating or otherwise interfering \nwith the funding of [the grants] . . . without written authorization from the Court.”  2025 WL 1587100, \nat *1 (4th Cir. June 5, 2025) (quoting Sustainability Inst. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1486979, at *4, *10 \n(D.S.C. May 20, 2025)).  Following the Supreme Court’s specific direction in California, the Fourth \nCircuit held that the Government was likely to succeed in showing that the district court lacked subject \nmatter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims.  Id.  The Fourth Circuit noted that, “like the grants in \nCalifornia, the grants [in Sustainability] were awarded by federal executive agencies to specific \ngrantees from a generalized fund . . . and it is the operative grant agreements which entitle any \nparticular Plaintiff to receive federal funds.”  Id. at *2.  While the district court had relied on Bowen v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988), in exercising jurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit rejected this \napproach,  noting  that  “the  Supreme  Court  distinguished  Bowen  in  California,  highlighting  the \nmeaningful difference between the relief in that case and an order ‘to enforce a contractual obligation \nto pay money’ along the lines of what the district court entered.”  Id.  And the Fourth Circuit held that \nit was “unlikely that [the plaintiffs’] ultra vires claims, which allege the Government violated the \nConstitution when it terminated or suspended [the plaintiffs’] grants, would provide a detour around \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 6 of 13 PageID# 447\nthe Tucker Act.”  Id. (citing Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327-28 \n(2015) (“The power of federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action is subject to . . . \nimplied statutory limitations,” and “the ‘express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive \nrule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others.’” (quoting Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. \n275, 290 (2001))); Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 \n(1991); Widakuswara v. Lake, 2025 WL 1288817, at *5 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2025) (staying injunction \nin  a  similar  case  raising  APA  claims  and  “mandamus,  impoundment,  Presentment  Clause, \nAppropriations  Clause,  Spending  Clause,  Take  Care  Clause,  Separation-of-Powers,  and ultra \nvires claims”)).5 \nJust two weeks ago, on August 21, 2025, in National Institutes of Health v. American Public \nHealth Association, the Supreme Court stayed a district court’s order vacating the Government’s \ntermination of various research grants pursuant to California but denied the application for a stay as to \nthe district court’s order vacating various related internal guidance documents describing the National \nInstitutes of Health’s (“NIH”) new priorities as arbitrary and capricious and unlawful in violation of \nthe APA.  2025 WL 2415669, *1 (U.S. August 21, 2025).  The Supreme Court divided 4-1-4, and \nJustice Amy Coney Barrett provided the critical, and what may ultimately be the decisive, analytical \nperspective for assisting lower courts in their efforts to navigate an ever-evolving federal jurisprudence.  \nId.  In her concurrence, Justice Barrett emphasized that, in the case before the Supreme Court, both the \ndistrict court and court of appeals had treated NIH’s termination of grants and its issuance of guidance \nas distinct agency actions.  Id. at *2 (Barrett, J., concurring).  Relying on this fact, Justice Barrett found \nthat just because “the agency guidance discusses internal policies related to grants does not transform \na challenge to that guidance into a claim ‘founded . . . upon’ contract that only the CFC can hear.”  Id. \n \n5 The Fourth Circuit has also cited California as support for staying other district court injunctions.  See \nMaryland v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 2025 WL 1073657, at *1 (4th Cir. Apr. 9, 2025); Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. \nEduc. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 1232337, at *1 (4th Cir. Apr. 10, 2025) (staying injunction related to the Department’s \ntermination of grants awarded for teachers). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 7 of 13 PageID# 448\nat *2.  Justice Barrett also emphasized the lack of a causal connection between the two actions, noting \nthat vacating the agency guidance did not reinstate the terminated grants.  Id.; see also id. at *3 (noting \nthat she was “not sure” that the challenges to the guidance and the grant terminations arise from \nsubstantially the same operative facts). \nTurning to the instant case, in their Motions, Plaintiffs request that this Court “preliminarily \nenjoin and/or temporarily restrain Defendants, including their officers, employees, agents, attorneys, \nand any person working in concert or participation with any Defendant or under any Defendant’s \nsupervision, direction or control, from designating [FCPS/APS] as ‘high-risk’ and requiring that \n[FCPS/APS] receive federal funds by reimbursement.”  FCSB, Dkt. 2 at 1-2; ASB, Dkt. 2 at 1-2.  \nBecause the relief that Plaintiffs seek ultimately requires this Court “to order the payment of money,” \nthis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under controlling Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit \nprecedent as discussed supra.  See California, 145 S. Ct. at 968 (holding a district court likely lacked \njurisdiction to enjoin the Department from terminating grants); Sustainability, 2025 WL 1587100, at \n*1 (holding a district court likely lacked jurisdiction to require the Government to restore access to \ngrant funds immediately and prohibit the Government from freezing, terminating, or otherwise \ninterfering with the funding of the grants without court authorization); NIH, 2025 WL 2415669, *1 \n(holding a district court likely lacked jurisdiction to vacate the Government’s termination of grants). \nBecause this Court is bound by controlling authority, Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary are \nunavailing.  As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs focus on the argument that they did not explicitly \nrequest “money damages,” and thus cannot be subject to the Tucker Act.  This argument cannot endure \nas it is not only contrary to the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in California and NIH and the Fourth \nCircuit’s admonition in Sustainability but also is contrary to an established line of authority from the \nFourth Circuit and other courts holding that plaintiffs may not artfully plead around Tucker Act \njurisdiction.  See Kidwell v. Dep’t of Army, Bd. for Corr. of Mil. Recs., 56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. Cir. \n1995) (“This is because plaintiffs can bypass Tucker Act jurisdiction by converting complaints which \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 8 of 13 PageID# 449\n‘at their essence’ seek money damages from the government into complaints requesting injunctive \nrelief or declaratory actions.  Because this forum shopping circumvents a primary purpose of the Act—\nto ensure that a central body adjudicates most claims against the United States Treasury, we have stated \nthat ‘jurisdiction under the Tucker Act cannot be avoided by disguising a money claim as a claim \nrequesting  a  form  of  equitable  relief.’”  (internal  citations  omitted));  see  also  Portsmouth \nRedevelopment & Hous. Auth. v. Pierce, 706 F.2d 471, 474 (4th Cir. 1983) (“Although the [plaintiff’s] \namended complaint phrases its request for money as a request for equitable relief, Claims Court \njurisdiction cannot be avoided by framing an essentially monetary claim in injunctive or declaratory \nterms.”).  Thus, even if Plaintiffs had avoided pleading an explicit request for money damages (which \nthey did not, as their Complaints seek to compel Defendants to “immediately pay”), their avoidance of \nthose words would not overcome the direct connection that their Motions and Complaints draw \nbetween the relief sought here and the disbursement of federal funds.  This connection compels the \nCourt to find that, under the Tucker Act, jurisdiction is lacking here.  \nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ reliance on 20 U.S.C. § 1683 is unavailing.6  That provision states that, \n“[i]n the case of action, not otherwise subject to judicial review, terminating or refusing to grant or to \ncontinue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply with any requirement imposed \npursuant to section 1682 of this title, any person aggrieved (including any State or political subdivision \nthereof and any agency of either) may obtain judicial review of such action in accordance with chapter \n7 of title 5 . . . .”  20 U.S.C. § 1683 (emphasis added).  But here the action is subject to judicial review \nin the Court of Federal Claims.  California, 145 S. Ct. at 968 (“[T]he Tucker Act grants the Court of \nFederal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on ‘any express or implied contract with the United \nStates.’” (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1))).  Accordingly, that provision does not apply here. \n \n6 Plaintiffs made a singular reference to 20 U.S.C. § 1683 in their Memoranda in Support of their Motions.  \nFCSB, Dkt. 3 at 16; ASB, Dkt. 3 at 16.  It was not until their Reply Briefs that Plaintiffs devoted any analysis to Section \n1683.  FCSB, Dkt. 27 at 6; ASB, Dkt. 26 at 6.  Thus, Defendants did not have an opportunity to respond.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 9 of 13 PageID# 450\nPlaintiffs also attempt to place their claims within the realm of those that Justice Barrett found \ndistinguishable in NIH, arguing that the Court of Federal Claims is unable to afford them relief given \nthat they “seek[] prospective equitable relief demanding . . . that Defendants comply with Title IX’s \nprocedural requirements.”  FCSB, Dkt. 27 at 9; ASB, Dkt. 26 at 9.  But, respectfully, that is not relief \nthat Plaintiffs seek in their Motions or Complaints, and Plaintiffs do not identify any count or relief \nsought that relates to Title IX’s procedural requirements.   \nMoreover, in Justice Barrett’s concurrence, she explained that “vacating the guidance” at issue \nthere “does not reinstate the terminated grants” and that such claims, although perhaps topically related, \nwere “legally distinct.”  NIH, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2 (Barrett, J., concurring); see also id. at *3 \n(noting that she was “not sure” that the challenges to the guidance and the grant terminations arise \nfrom substantially the same operative facts).  Although Plaintiffs here have exercised a degree of \ningenuity, it is Plaintiffs who have blurred the line in this case and expressly linked their claims to the \ndisbursement of money.  Indeed, the Motions specifically condition the need for “immediate action” \njustifying injunctive relief on “the federal funds that Defendants have effectively frozen.”  FCSB, Dkt. \n3 at 16; APS, Dkt. 3 at 16; see also FCSB, Dkt. 1 at 28 ¶ (j); ASB, Dkt. 1 at 27 ¶ (j).  Plaintiffs’ proposed \norders in support of injunctive relief refer to no specific count, no specific claim, and seek, as a singular \nrelief,  to  enjoin  Defendants  “from  designating  [FCPS/APS]  as  ‘high-risk’  and  requiring  that \n[FCPS/APS] receive federal funds by reimbursement.”  FCSB, Dkt. 2-1 at 2; ASB, Dkt. 2-1 at 2.  \nIndeed, throughout their briefing, almost every time Plaintiffs mention the “high-risk” designation, it \nis in conjunction with the effect that this determination has had or will have on the disbursement of \nfederal funds.  Moreover, despite the discussion at the September 3, 2025 hearing and the Court’s \nquestions regarding how the Tucker Act applies to specific counts, Plaintiffs continue to refer broadly \nto the Complaints in their entirety.   Thus, the Court is left without a principled basis on which it could \ncarve out any particular count from the overarching reinstatement-of-grants framework and craft a non-\n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 10 of 13 PageID#\n451\ncausally or legally related relief.  Again, this compels the conclusion that this Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction. \nFinally, with respect to the recently issued case President & Fellows of Harvard College v. \nUnited States Department of Justice, No. 25-cv-11048, Dkt. 238 (D. Mass. Sept. 3, 2025) (“Harvard”) \n(addressing allegations relating to antisemitism and the First Amendment),7 this Court agrees with the \nvery contemplative statement of U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs opining that the boundary \nbetween the APA and the Tucker Act remains, at least somewhat, “elusive” given the procedural \nposture of the cases in which these lines are being drawn.   See id. at 24.  But, to be sure, based on the \nrecord before the Court, the relief sought, and more importantly the Fourth Circuit law binding this \nCourt (which are not precedents binding the District of Massachusetts), this Court finds that the case \nhere falls on the other side of the line.  See Sustainability, 2025 WL 1587100, at *2 (holding it was \n“unlikely that [the plaintiffs’] ultra vires claims, which allege the Government violated the Constitution \nwhen it terminated or suspended [the plaintiffs’] grants, would provide a detour around the Tucker \nAct”).  And, in the Harvard case, Judge Burroughs specifically held that, “[r]egardless of how these \nclaims are resolved, the government will not necessarily be obligated to disburse any additional funds \n. . . .”  Id. at 31.  Again, Plaintiffs here provide this Court with no sustainable  basis on which to make \na similar finding, especially when the very first paragraph of the Complaints alleges that Defendants’ \nplacement of FCPS and APS on high-risk status had “the result that” federal funding would be done \nby reimbursement only, where the emergency nature of the relief sought is premised on “freezing \nfederal funds,” and where Plaintiffs specifically seek immediate payment of federal funds in their \nComplaints.  FCSB, Dkt. 1 ¶ 1 (“On August 19, 2025, the Department of Education . . . issued a press \nrelease announcing that it was ‘placing . . . [FCPS] . . . in Northern Virginia on high-risk status’ with \n \n7 The Harvard decision was issued on September 3, 2025, the same day that this Court held argument in \nthese cases.  Thus, the parties did not have an opportunity to raise this decision at oral argument, and it has only been \ndiscussed in Plaintiffs’ Reply Briefs. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 11 of 13 PageID#\n452\nthe result that ‘all Department funds including formula funding, discretionary grants, and impact aid \ngrants’ will be ‘done by reimbursement only.’”); ASB, Dkt. 1 ¶ 1 (same for APS); FCSB, Dkt. 1 at 28 \n¶ (j) (asking this Court to “[r]equire that Defendants immediately pay to FCBS . . . funds”); ASB, Dkt. \n1 at 27 ¶ (j) (same for ASB); FCSB, Dkt. 3 at 16 (“Because the federal funds that Defendants have \neffectively frozen are essential . . . , immediate action is needed.”); ASB, Dkt. 3 at 16 (same).  \nAccordingly, this Court lacks jurisdiction, and Plaintiffs’ Motions will be denied. \nB.  Whether the Complaints Will Be Dismissed for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction \nThe lack of subject matter jurisdiction to provide the relief requested in the Motions also \ncompels the Court to examine the Complaints.  As noted supra, at oral argument, the Court asked \nquestions of all parties to determine whether any of the specific counts alleged here should be treated \ndifferently from one another—no party argued they should.  Accordingly, the Court, like the parties, \nwill address the Complaint as a whole.8 \nFor much the same reason that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Motions, the \nCourt also lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Complaints.  The Court notes that almost every \ncount in the Complaint contains specific references to grants, funds, or reimbursements.  See, e.g., \nFCSB, Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 66 (“constructive termination or refusal to continue federal funds owed to FCPS”), \n69 (“Defendants’ actions constructively terminating or refusing to continue funds owed to FCPS”), 88 \n(“Defendants have nonetheless conditioned FCPS’s receipt of federal funds . . . .”), 89 (“conditioning \nthe Department funding”), 97 (“FCPS receives federal education funds under several federal statutes \n. . . . These funds are critical to FCPS’s ability to provide state and federally mandated education-\nrelated services . . . .”), 99 (“Defendants are conditioning essential federal funding . . . .”), 101 (“[t]his \n \n8 Judge Burroughs found in the Harvard case that “splitting [those] claims between two forums [was] \nprocedurally unworkable.”  No. 25-cv-11048, Dkt. 238, at 29.  Here, too, Plaintiffs’ claims are inextricably intertwined \nand must “rise [and] fall together” unlike the guidance and terminations in NIH.  Id.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ claims, which \nultimately and fundamentally seek immediate disbursement of funds, fall within the Tucker Act and the instruction \nand precedents of the Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 12 of 13 PageID#\n453\nfunding threat”), 107 (“Defendants have no authority . . . to demand FCPS rescind Regulation 2603.2 \n. . . in order for FCPS to receive federal funding.”), 108 (“FCSB is entitled to a declaration that \nDefendants acted ultra vires by demanding that FCSB rescind its policy in order for FCPS to receive \nfederal funding.”), 112 (“FCSB and Defendant have adverse legal interests of sufficient immediacy \nand reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment” where the issue requiring immediacy is \nthe disbursement of funds); ASB, Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 66, 69, 88, 89, 97, 99, 101, 107, 108, 112 (same allegations \nby ASB).  As noted above, the Complaints also specifically seek to have Defendants “immediately \npay” Plaintiffs funds.  FCSB, Dkt. 1 at 28 ¶ (j); ASB, Dkt. 1 at 27 ¶ (j).  Thus, under binding Supreme \nCourt and Fourth Circuit precedent, because Plaintiffs base their Complaints around requests “to order \nthe payment of money,” this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the actions.  See California, \n145 S. Ct. at 968 (holding a district court likely lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the Department from \nterminating grants); Sustainability, 2025 WL 1587100, at *1 (holding a district court likely lacked \njurisdiction to require the Government to restore access to grant funds immediately and prohibit the \nGovernment from freezing, terminating, or otherwise interfering with the funding of the grants without \ncourt authorization); NIH, 2025 WL 2415669, *1 (holding a district court likely lacked jurisdiction to \nvacate the Government’s termination of grants).  Accordingly, the Complaints will be dismissed. \n*  *  * \nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Emergency \nMotions for Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order (FCSB, Dkt. 2; ASB, Dkt. 2) \nare DENIED; and it is  \nFURTHER ORDERED that the Complaints (FCSB, Dkt. 1; ASB, Dkt. 1) are DISMISSED \nWITHOUT PREJUDICE; and it is \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01432-RDA-LRV     Document 28     Filed 09/05/25     Page 13 of 13 PageID#\n454\nFURTHER ORDERED that the Motion for Leave to File Brief of Amicus Curiae (FCSB, Dkt. \n17) is DENIED.9 \nThe Clerk of the Court is directed to provide copies of this Order to all counsel of record and \nto place this matter among the ended causes. \nIt is SO ORDERED.  \nAlexandria, Virginia \nSeptember 5, 2025 \n \n \n \n9 A federal district court has “broad discretion in deciding whether to allow a non-party to participate as \namicus curiae.”  F.E.R.C. v. Powhatan Energy Fund, LLC, 2017 WL 11682615, at *1 (E.D. Va. Mar. 15, 2017).  \nFurther, a court should only grant leave to file an amicus curiae brief if the court “deems the proffered information \ntimely and useful.”  Id.  Counsel for both the Plaintiffs and the Government have zealously, professionally, and most \ncompetently assisted the Court in reaching its decision.  Here, while the Court appreciates the time and energy \nexercised by the amicus in support of its perspective, the proffered amicus brief does not aid the Court in analyzing \nthe issues presented to it.  Accordingly, the Court exercises its discretion to deny the motion. \n13 \n ",

At  the  time  its  brief  was  filed,  ED  did  not  have  knowledge  that \nreconsideration had been filed.  After Plaintiff’s representations during argument today, ED \nconducted further investigation of the matter and discovered that on August 26, 2025, Plaintiff \nsubmitted a request for reconsideration via e-mail.  It appears ED did not have knowledge that \nsuch request was submitted because the e-mail was caught by a spam filter.  Plaintiff did not attach \nthe request for reconsideration to their Complaint or Motion, and Defendants likewise do not \nbelieve it is necessary to put in the record now beyond clarifying its existence.  \n\n  Notwithstanding this factual clarification, Plaintiff’s request for reconsideration does not \nchange the thrust of Defendants’ arguments, including specifically that Plaintiff failed to exhaust \nadministrative remedies.  Plaintiff filed suit and requested a temporary restraining order only three \ndays after submitting its reconsideration request and represented at the hearing that it did not \nbelieve it needed to wait for a response before filing suit.  Defendants remain willing to consider \nthe reconsideration request, but believe that if Plaintiff seeks for this to be resolved at the agency \nlevel – as its request for reconsideration suggests – that this action should be dismissed or stayed \nuntil such time as such reconsideration process concludes.   \n \n \n[Signature page follows.] \n   \n2 \n\nDated: September 3, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \nERIK S.
