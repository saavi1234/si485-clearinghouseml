(hereinafter referred to as \nโARHโ), by counsel, and tenders the following for its Response in Opposition to Plaintiffโs Motion \nfor Class Certification.   \nBACKGROUND \nIn 2025, the Kentucky General Assembly enacted KRS ยง 197.280 which prohibits the use \nof public funds for, among other things, โprescribing or administering cross-sex hormones in \namounts greater than would normally be produced endogenously in a healthy person of the same \nage and sex.โ KRS ยง 197.280(1)(a)(1). Due to the enactment of the law, Plaintiff Maddilyn \nMarcum (โMs. Marcumโ) claims the Kentucky Department of Corrections (โDOCโ) issued a \npolicy requiring gender-affirming hormone therapy to be tapered and eventually discontinued for \ninmates currently receiving this treatment. Ms. Marcum further asserts, without any supporting \n1 \n4920-9646-5497.v3 \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 22     Filed: 07/30/25     Page: 2 of 10 - Page ID#:\n332\nevidence in the record, that there are currently sixty-seven (67) other inmates that are situated \nsimilarly to her and negatively affected by the enactment of KRS ยง 197.280.1\nMore specifically, Ms. Marcumโs suit alleges a violation of her Eighth Amendment rights \nand additionally moves for class certification to bring claims on behalf of all inmates in DOC \ncustody that have been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and receive, or would receive, gender-\naffirming hormone therapy treatment. However, for the reasons established below, her Motion for \nClass Certification should be denied. First, the number of potential class members is not so \nnumerous as to render joinder impracticable. Further, commonality of claims is non-existent \nbecause the claims at issue among the putative class members would require an individualized \nassessment of each proposed class memberโs specific medical needs. Finally, Ms. Marcumโs \nclaims are not typical of the class, nor does she adequately represent the class. Accordingly, Ms. \nMarcumโs claims, and those of the putative class members, fail to satisfy the factors supporting \nclass certification.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \nAt the outset for the Court to certify a class action, the proposed class must meet the \nfollowing  threshold  requirements  of  Rule  23(a):  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and \nadequacy of representation. In re American Medical Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th Cir. 1996). \nIf each prerequisite set forth in Rule 23(a) is established, the plaintiffs must also demonstrate that \nthe class may be maintained under one of the three theories available under Rule 23(b). Glazer v. \nWhirlpool Corp. (In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Prods. Liab. Litig.), 722 F.3d 838, \n85 1 (6th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 571 U.S. 1196 (2014).  Here, Ms. Marcum advances a theory \n1 In her Declaration, Ms. Marcum states that โaccording to media reportsโ there are 67 incarcerated \nindividuals receiving hormone treatment for Gender Dysphoria. See Record No. 4-2 at ยถ 15. However, Ms. \nMarcum failed to attach any of the alleged โmedia reportsโ to support her assertion.\n2 \n4920-9646-5497.v3 \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 22     Filed: 07/30/25     Page: 3 of 10 - Page ID#:\n333\nunder Rule 23(b)(2), which requires that โthe party opposing the class [must have] acted or refused \nto act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.โ Coleman v. Gen. \nMotors Acceptance Corp., 296 F.3d 443, 446 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)). \nThe plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that class certification is proper. In re \nAmerican Medical Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d at 1079. A class action may not be approved simply โby \nvirtue of its designation as such in the pleadings,โ nor may a prospective class representative \nsimply rely upon โmere repetition of the language of Rule 23(a)โ to support its motion. Id. The \ncourt must engage in a โrigorous analysisโ to determine whether all the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) \nare satisfied. General Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982). \nARGUMENT \nI. Ms. Marcum cannot satisfy the Rule 23(a) prerequisites  \nRule 23(a) states: \nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on \nbehalf of all members only if: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class; and \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass. \nAll four prerequisites must be met before a class may be certified. Pilgrim v. Universal Health\nCard, LLC, 660 F.3d 943, 945 (6th Cir. 2011); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). None of the four requirements \nfor granting Ms. Marcumโs Motion are present in this case. \na. The proposed class is not so numerous as to render joinder impracticable  \nTo satisfy numerosity, โimpracticability of joinder must be positively shown, and cannot \nbe speculative.โ Golden v. City of Columbus, 404 F.3d 950, 966 (6th Cir. 2005). โSeveral factors \n3 \n4920-9646-5497.v3 \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 22     Filed: 07/30/25     Page: 4 of 10 - Page ID#:\n334\ndetermine the practicability of joinder including, but not limited to, the size of the class, the ease \nof identifying its members and ascertaining their addresses, the facility of making service on them \nif joined, and their geographic dispersion.โ Jaynes v. United States 69 Fed. Cl. 450, 454 (Ct. Cl. \n2006) (citing Kilgo v. Bowman Transp., Inc., 789 F.2d 859, 878 (11th Cir. 1986)). โJoinder is \nconsidered more practicable when all members of the class are from the same geographic area.โ  \nId. (citing Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corp., 780 F.2d 124, 131-32 (1st Cir. 1985). Additionally, \njoinder is more practicable when class members are easily identifiable. Id.; Adams v. Fed. \nMaterials Co., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92539 (W.D. Ky. 2006) (โJoinder may be considered more \npracticable where all members of the class are from the same geographic area.โ) \nThere is no specific number that renders a proposed class sufficiently numerous, but courts \nhave held classes between 50-200 are not so  numerous as to render joinder impracticable, \nespecially if the proposed members are geographically concentrated and easily identifiable. See, \ne.g., Trevizo v. Adams, 455 F.3d 1155, 1162 (10th Cir. 2006) (finding that a proposed class of 84 \nindividuals was not so numerous as to render joinder impracticable); Voorhees v. Cortona Ptnrs, \nNo. 2022-CA-0942-ME, 2022 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 744, at *3 (Ct. App. Dec. 22, 2022) (trial \ncourt currently found that joinder of 124 individual plaintiffs was not impracticable because of the \nease to identify and locate each); see also Sanft v. Winnebago Indus., 214 F.R.D. 514, 526 (N.D. \nIowa 2003) (joinder was not impracticable for a proposed class of 51 members because the \nproposed members were geographically concentrated mostly in northern Iowa and could be \nindividually identified); Hum v. Dericks, 162 F.R.D. 628, 634 (D. Haw. 1995) (declining to certify \n200-member class because class members were located in the same state and easily identifiable).  \nHere, Ms. Marcum claims there are currently sixty-seven (67) inmates receiving treatment \nfor Gender Dysphoria. Assuming her assertion to be true, joinder here is practicable because all of \n4 \n4920-9646-5497.v3 \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 22     Filed: 07/30/25     Page: 5 of 10 - Page ID#:\n335\nthe inmates are in the same geographic region โ namely Kentucky and are being held in Kentucky \nstate penitentiaries. Additionally, all are easily identifiable based on records maintained by the \nDOC, and any future class members would also be easily identifiable and located in the same \ngeographic region. Accordingly, the proposed class is not so numerous as to render joinder \nimpracticable. \nb. Commonality and Typicality \nTo  demonstrate  commonality,  Ms.  Marcumโs  claims  must  be  based  on  a  common \ncontention that is โof such a nature that it is capable of class wide resolution โ which means that \ndetermination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one \nof the claims in one stroke.โ Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011). โโ[T]he \ncommonality requirement will not be met . . . if each class membersโ claim would necessitate an \nindividualized determination of liability.โ Schilling v. Kenton County, No. 10-143-DLB, 2011 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 8050 (E.D. Ky. Jan. 27, 2011) (citing 5 James Wm. Moore, Mooreโs Federal Practice \nยง 23.23 [2]).    \nTo establish typicality, a plaintiff must show โโ(1) that their interests are squarely aligned \nwith the interests of the class members and (2) that their claims arise from the same events and are \npremised on the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.โโ Baxley v. Jividen, 338 \nF.R.D. 80, 88 (S.D.W. Va. 2020) (citation omitted). โThe fact that the named plaintiffs have the \nsame general complaint against the defendant does not render their claims typical.โ Waters v. \nElectrolux Home Products, Inc., No. 5:13-cv-151, 2016 WL 3926431, at *5 (N.D.W. Va. July 18, \n2016) (internal quotations and citation omitted). โ[T]he typicality requirement is not satisfied when \na plaintiff can prove his own claim but not necessarily have proved anybodyโs elseโs claim.โ \nBeattie v. CenturyTel, Inc., 511 F.3d 554, 561 (6th Cir. 2007).  \n5 \n4920-9646-5497.v3 \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 22     Filed: 07/30/25     Page: 6 of 10 - Page ID#:\n336\nThe โcommonalityโ and โtypicalityโ requirements of Rule 23(a) โserve as guideposts for \ndetermining  whether  under  the  particular  circumstances  maintenance  of  a  class  action  is \neconomical and whether the named plaintiffโs claim and the class claims are so interrelated that \nthe interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.โ Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. 338 at n.5.  The two provisions โtend to merge.โ Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. \nv. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n. 13 (1982). \nAlthough Ms. Marcum asserts that she and the other proposed members are entitled to \nclass-wide injunctive relief compelling the Defendants to provide class members with gender-\naffirming hormone treatments, the Court cannot resolve this claim on a class-wide basis. Ms. \nMarcumโs Eighth Amendment claim depends on the Court finding that Defendants acted with \nโdeliberate indifference to [her] serious medical needs.โ See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 \n(1976). That subjective standard is notoriously fact- and inmate-specific.  Because of the fact-\nspecific nature of the inquiry, Ms. Marcumโs claim is not typical of the class and commonality \ncannot  be  established.    Merely  because  the  statute  applies  to  all  inmates,  does  not  mean \ncommonality is met. Prison officials applying a state law equally to all does not mean that all \ninmates who are impacted by the law have suffered an Eighth Amendment injury. \nWhether any medication or accommodation must be provided to an inmate to address a \nserious medical need is an individualized determination by a medical provider that turns on the \ninmatesโ specific circumstances.  Heather v. Ochsner Fertility Clinic, 102 So. 3d 913, 921 (La. Ct. \nApp. 2012) (โIn this case, in order to determine causation, the trial court will have to come to an \nindividualized understanding of each patientโs health, medical history, records, and other variables. \nTherefore, questions that are patient-specific and individual to each class member will predominate \nover any questions that are common to the subclass as a whole.โ). Because those circumstances \n6 \n4920-9646-5497.v3 \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 22     Filed: 07/30/25     Page: 7 of 10 - Page ID#:\n337\ndiffer from inmate to inmate, the claims of putative class members are not susceptible to resolution \non a class-wide basis. Kress v. CCA of Tennessee, LLC, 694 F.3d 890, 893 (7th Cir. 2012) \n(affirming district court decision denying class certification because โ[c]laims of inadequate \nmedical care by their nature require individual determinations, as the level of medical care required \nto comport with constitutional and statutory standards will vary depending on each inmateโs \ncircumstancesโ). \nIn other words, the proposed classโand any class that could be drawnโis going to require \nindividual inquiries into whether each class memberโs presumed2 desire for hormone replacement \ntherapy is necessary given their unique medical conditions or if there are alternative treatments \navailable. Without that inquiry, Ms. Marcum cannot demonstrate that all class members have \nsuffered  the  โsame  injury.โ  See  Dukes,  564  U.S.  at  349-50.  Accordingly,  the  elements  of \ncommonality and typicality are not met. \nc. Adequacy \nFinally, the Court must โmeasure the adequacy of the class membersโ representation based \nupon two factors: โ1) the representatives must have common interests with unnamed members of \nthe class, and 2) it must appear that the representatives will vigorously prosecute the interests of \nthe class through qualified counsel.โโ Greenberg v. Procter & Gamble Co. (In re Dry Max \nPampers Litig.), 724 F.3d 713, 721 (6th Cir. 2013) (quoting Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC, \n708  F.3d  747,  757  (6th  Cir.  2013)).  Class  representatives  are  generally  adequate  if  the \nrepresentatives are โpart of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as \nthe class members.โ E. Tex. Motor Freight Sys., Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 (1977). \n2   Notably, Ms. Marcum presents no evidence establishing that each member of her putative class \ndesires โ as she does โ to continue with gender-affirming hormone treatment. Similarly, she fails to present \nany evidence that there are no other available alternative treatments that will Constitutionally satisfy her \nputative class membersโ individual medical needs.\n7 \n4920-9646-5497.v3 \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 22     Filed: 07/30/25     Page: 8 of 10 - Page ID#:\n338\nHere, Ms. Marcumโs individual medical history and any necessary care to address her \nserious  medical  needs  are  unlikely  to  be  identical  or  typical  to  that  of  the  putative  class \nmembers. Because her claims are not typical she is an inadequate class representative.  \nAccordingly, Ms. Marcum has not satisfied any of the Rule 23(a) prerequisites, and her \nmotion should be denied.  \nII. Rule 23(b) \nMs. Marcum also seeks to certify the class under Rule 23(b)(2) which states that โ[a] class \naction may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if . . . the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ โThe key to the \n(b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warrantedโthe notion \nthat the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class \nmembers or as to none of them.โ Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011). โIn \nother words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would \nprovide relief to each member of the class.โ Id. A class is cohesive where โthe case will not depend \non adjudication of facts particular to any subset of the class nor require a remedy that differentiates \nmaterially among class members.โ Lemon v. Intโl Union of Operating Engโrs, Local No. 139, 216 \nF.3d 577, 580 (7th Cir. 2000). \nMs. Marcum argues that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are met because the Defendants \nhave acted, or will act, on grounds generally applicable to the class by reducing, terminating, or \nwithholding  HRT  treatmentโ  pursuant  to  KRS  ยง  197.280.  However,  whether  any  Eighth \nAmendment violation occurred will necessarily turn on an individualized inquiry into the medical \ncircumstances of each putative class member. Based on the fact-bound nature of the inquiry under \n8 \n4920-9646-5497.v3 \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 22     Filed: 07/30/25     Page: 9 of 10 - Page ID#:\n339\nthe deliberate indifference standard, the Defendantsโ conduct could not be found to violate the \nEighth Amendment โas to all of the class members or as to none of them.โ Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at \n36. \nCONCLUSION \nBased on the foregoing, Ms. Marcumโs Motion for Class Certification should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ M.

[R. 4.]  Because the Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the requirements of \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, her request for a Temporary Restraining Order is DENIED.  \nHowever, the Court will continue analysis of Plaintiffโs Motion for Preliminary Injunction after a \nscheduling conference has been held and additional briefing has been filed. \nI \nPlaintiff Maddilyn Marcum was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and placed on \nHormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) starting five years prior to her incarceration.  [R. 1 at 11.] \nPrior to Marcumโs sentencing, she was held in a county facility where she was not administered \nHRT.  Id.  Once in the Department of Correctionsโ (DOC) custody following her sentencing, she \nwas again refused HRT under the DOCโs โfreeze frameโ policy.  [R. 4 at 6.]  Under the โfreeze \nframeโ policy, a prisoner is entitled to receive HRT only if they were receiving HRT when they \nentered DOCโs custody.  Id.  Thus, because the county jail refused to provide the Plaintiff with \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 5     Filed: 07/16/25     Page: 2 of 4 - Page ID#: 127\nHRT during her pretrial incarceration, DOC found that Marcum was not receiving HRT when \nshe entered their custody and was not eligible to receive HRT.  Id. \nIn 2016, DOC reversed course and found that Marcum did qualify for HRT.  Id.  Marcum \nreceived treatment from 2016-2025, which is when the Public Funds Ban was passed.  Id.  Under \nthe Public Funds Ban, โpublic funds shall not be directly or indirectly used, granted, paid, or \ndistributed for the purpose of providing a cosmetic service or elective procedure to an inmate in a \ncorrectional facility.โ  KRS ยง 197.280(2).  HRT falls squarely into the definition of a โcosmetic \nservice or elective procedureโ as defined by the statute.  See KRS ยง 197.280(1)(a)(1).   \nAfter the passage of the Public Funds Ban, Marcum was notified that her dosage would \nbe reduced by one-half beginning some time in August 2025 and eventually completely \neliminated some time in November 2025, consistent with the Public Funds Ban.  Id. at 7.  \nMarcum is asking for both a TRO and Preliminary Injunction, as well as a class action \ncertification.  [R. 3; R. 4.]  As grounds, Marcum argues that the Public Funds Ban as it relates to \nHRT stands in violation of the Eighth Amendment, which bans state actors from โunnecessarily \nand wantonly inflicting painโ on an inmate by acting with โdeliberate indifferenceโ toward the \ninmate's serious medical needs. See Blackmore v. Kalamazoo Cnty., 390 F.3d 890, 895 (6th Cir. \n2004) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). \nII \n  Rule 65 allows the Court to issue a TRO without notice to the other party only if โ(A) \nspecific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable \ninjury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in \nopposition; and (B) the movantโs attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and \nthe reasons why it should not be required.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1).  In determining whether to \n2 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 5     Filed: 07/16/25     Page: 3 of 4 - Page ID#: 128\nissue a TRO, the Court examines: (1) whether the movant has shown a strong likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; (2) whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not \nissued; (3) whether the issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) \nwhether the public interest would be served by issuing the injunction.  Overstreet v. Lexingtonโ\nFayette Urban County Government, 305 F.3d 566, 573 (citations omitted).   \nโ[A] temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy designed for the limited \npurpose of preserving the status quo pending further proceedings on the merits[.]โ Stein v. \nThomas, 672 Fed. Appโx 565, 572 (6th Cir. 2016).  This is because โour entire jurisprudence \nruns counter to the notion of court action taken before reasonable notice and an opportunity to be \nheard has been granted both sides of a dispute.โ  Reed v. Cleveland Bd. of Educ., 581 F.2d 570, \n573 (6th Cir. 1978) (quoting Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Teamsters, 415 U.S. 423, 439 (1974)). \nThe Plaintiff has asked the Court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing or threatening to \nenforce the Public Funds Ban as it relates to HRT against the Plaintiff or any other similarly \nsituated person.  [R. 4-3 at 4.]  Per Rule 65, a temporary restraining order may not exceed \nfourteen (14) days.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2).  The Plaintiff asserts that her HRT treatment will \nโbe reduced by one-half starting in August, 2025, and that it would be completely eliminated in \nNovember, 2025.โ  [R. 4 at 7.]  Although the Plaintiff does not state an exact date, even \nassuming that the change in treatment goes into effect on August 1, 2025, a TRO would not \nprovide the relief the Plaintiff is seeking.  If a TRO was granted and the enforcement of the \nPublic Funds Ban was suspended for fourteen days, during which time the Plaintiff is already \nentitled to receive treatment, it does not automatically follow that Public Funds Ban will not be \nenforced following the expiration of the TRO.  The Court acknowledges the principle that a \nviolation of oneโs constitutional rights is an irreparable harm.   See, e.g., Deja Vu of Nashville, \n3 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 5     Filed: 07/16/25     Page: 4 of 4 - Page ID#: 129\nInc. v. Metro. Govโt of Nashville & Davison County, 274 F.3d 377 (6th Cir. 2001); Jones v. \nPerry, 215 F. Supp. 3d 563 (E.D. Ky. 2016).  But the irreparable harm the Plaintiff alleges is not \nimmediately preventable by means of a temporary restraining order.  With that said, \nexpeditiously considering preliminary relief is warranted.    \nIII \nAccordingly, and the Court being otherwise sufficiently advised, it is hereby \nORDERED as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffsโ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order [R. 4] is DENIED; and \n2.  A scheduling conference regarding Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction [R. 4] shall be held telephonically on Thursday, July 17, 2025 at \n1:30 p.m. in Frankfort, Kentucky.  \n3.  To join the teleconference, the parties are DIRECTED to call Microsoft \nTeams Teleconferencing at 1-606-371-5577 and enter Phone Conference ID \n773 707 422#.   \n \nThis the 15th day of July 2025.  \n \n \n \n4 \n ",

In support \nof this motion, Plaintiff states as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of herself and on behalf of a class of similarly-situated \nincarcerated  individuals  under  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983  challenging,  on  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment grounds, Kentuckyโs statutory ban on public funds being used to provide Hormone \nReplacement Therapy (โHRTโ) for Kentucky prisoners (the โPublic Funds Banโ), codified at \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 2 of 22 - Page ID#: 54\nKentucky Revised Statute (โKRSโ) ยง 197.280(2) and (3).1 Plaintiff alleges that enforcement of this \nPublic Funds Ban constitutes deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of herself and \nthe proposed class, both facially and as-applied, because it operates as a blanket termination of \npreviously prescribed (or refusal to provide in the first instance) HRT for an objectively serious \nmedical condition, Gender Dysphoria, despite the known substantial risk of harm that will result \nfrom doing so. [Class Action Complaint (โCompl.โ), at ยถยถ 1, 4, 19-27, 52-84.]  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nBackground On Gender Dysphoria \nAt birth, infants are assigned a sex, either male or female, based on the appearance of their \nexternal genitalia. [Compl., at ยถยถ 16-17; Declaration of Dr. Dan H. Karasic (โKarasic Decl.โ) \nattached as Ex. 1, at ยถ 32.] For most people, their assigned sex correlates to their gender identity. \nBut oneโs sex is more complicated and multifactorial, in that other factors beyond external genital \ncharacteristics also play a role such as chromosomes, endogenous hormones, gonads, gender \nidentity, and variations in brain structure and function. And for transgender individuals, their \nassigned sex does not align with their gender identity. [Compl, at ยถ 17; Karasic Decl., at ยถ 37.] \nIndeed, based on data from the Williams Institute, approximately 0.6% of the United States \npopulation age 13 or older, or about 1.6 million people, identify as transgender.

A marked incongruence between oneโs experienced/expressed gender and \nassigned gender, of at least 6 months duration, as manifested by at least two \nof the following (one of which must be Criterion A1): \n \n1.  A  marked  incongruence  between  oneโs  experienced/expressed \ngender and primary or secondary sex characteristics. \n2.

If left untreated, however, Gender Dysphoria can cause significant harm to the patient, \nincluding a significantly increased risk of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicidality. [Compl., \nat ยถ 22, 26-27; Karasic Decl., at ยถ 48.] Moreover, untreated Gender Dysphoria can also impair \nindividualsโ ability to function in other aspects of life. But these risks decline when transgender \nindividuals live according to their gender identity and have access to medically-indicated care, \nincluding  HRT.  [Id.  at  ยถ  48-49.]  Indeed,  well-documented  scientific  research  and  clinical \nexperience have demonstrated that social transition and gender-affirming medical care, which \nincludes HRT, can significantly relieve the distress and associated physical and psychological \nharms from untreated Gender Dysphoria. [Compl., at ยถ 23-25; Karasic Decl., at ยถ 28.] \nFor  individuals  for  whom  gender-affirming  medical  care  is  indicated,  there  are  no \nalternative evidence-based treatments. [Karasic Decl., at ยถ 29, 66.] Moreover, barring people with \nGender Dysphoria from socially transitioning, and withdrawing or denying gender-affirming \nmedical care to those for whom it is indicated, creates a substantial risk of significant harm to their \nhealth and well-being, including heightened risk of self-harm and suicidality. [Compl., at ยถ 26-27; \nKarasic Decl., at ยถ 30.] \nTo be sure, social transition alone can adequately address the distress associated with \nGender Dysphoria for some people.

Relevant to this action, โcosmetic \nservice or elective procedureโ includes โ[p]rescribing or administering cross-sex hormones in \namounts greater than would normally be produced endogenously in a healthy person of the same \nage and sex.โ KRS ยง 197.280(1)(a)(1). Thus, KRS ยง 197.280(2)โs ban on public funds being used \nfor โcosmetic service[s] or elective procedure[s]โ applies to HRT as a treatment for Gender \nDysphoria. Moreover, โpublic fundsโ is broadly defined to include โany money, regardless of the \noriginal source of the money, of: [t]he Commonwealth of Kentucky or any department, agency, or \ninstrumentality  thereof;  [a]ny  county,  city,  local  school  district,  or  special  district,  or  any \ndepartment,  agency,  or  instrumentality  thereof;  and  [a]ny  other political  subdivision  of  the \nCommonwealth or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof.โ KRS ยง 197.280(1)(b)(1)-\n(3).  \nThe Public Funds Ban on HRT care for Gender Dysphoria does contain an โexceptionโ \nwhere โa health care provider has initiated a course of treatment . . .and the health care provider \ndetermines . . .that immediately terminating the use of the drug or medication would cause physical \nharm to the inmate.โ KRS ยง 197.280(3). However, this โexceptionโ is merely temporary, in that it \npermits the use of public funds for HRT (upon the requisite showing of harm), but only for a \n5 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 6 of 22 - Page ID#: 58\nlimited period of time โduring which the inmateโs use of the drug or hormone is systematically \nreduced and eliminated.โ KRS ยง 197.280(3).  \nImpact Of The Public Funds Ban On HRT Care \n  Prior to passage of the Public Funds Ban, DOC allowed individuals diagnosed with Gender \nDysphoria to receive HRT treatment under the care of a licensed medical provider. [Compl., at ยถยถ \n38-40.] But the manner in which it did so evolved over time. Specifically, Plaintiff had been \ndiagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and placed on a regime of HRT treatment for approximately \nfive years prior to the events that led to her incarceration in 2014. [Compl., at ยถ 35-36; Declaration \nof Maddilyn Marcum (โPlaintiff Decl.โ), attached as Ex. 2, at ยถยถ 3-5.] However, when DOC \nassumed custody of Plaintiff in 2015, it refused to allow her to receive HRT treatment under its \nthen-operative  โfreeze  frameโ  policy.  [Plaintiff  Decl.,  at  ยถยถ  8-9.]  Under  that  policy,  DOC \nauthorized HRT care for transgender prisoners but only if they were receiving HRT treatment when \nthey entered DOCโs custody. [Id. at ยถ 9.] And because the county jail had refused to provide \nPlaintiff with HRT during her pretrial incarceration there, DOC took the position that Plaintiff did \nnot qualify to receive HRT care. [Id.] \n  But DOC changed its position in 2016 after its Health Care Administration Review Team \nreviewed Plaintiffโs case and agreed that her HRT treatment should be provided. [Id. at ยถ 10.] So, \nin 2016, DOCโs medical providers prescribed HRT to treat Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria, and DOC \nallowed her to resume HRT treatment at that time. [Compl., at ยถ 38; id. at ยถ 10.] Thereafter, \nPlaintiffโs HRT treatment for Gender Dysphoria went undisturbed from 2016 until May 2025 - \nshortly after the passage of the Public Funds Ban. [Compl., at ยถยถ 39, 41; Plaintiff Decl., at ยถ 13.]  \nMoreover, at the time the Kentucky General Assembly debated passage of the Public Funds \nBan, there were sixty-six other DOC inmates also receiving HRT to treat their Gender Dysphoria \n6 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 7 of 22 - Page ID#: 59\nbesides Plaintiff. [Compl., at ยถ 6 (citing AUSTIN SCHICK, Committee approves bill banning \nhormone treatment and gender reassignment, Spectrum News 1 (Feb. 14, 2025), available at \nhttps://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2025/02/13/inmate-gender-services-bill (last \nvisited June 3, 2025)).] \n  After the General Assembly enacted the Public Funds Ban (but one month before its \neffective date), Defendant ARHโs employee, APRN Bonnie Ferguson, notified Plaintiff on May \n28, 2025 that the HRT treatment she had been receiving (under the care of APRN Ferguson and \nDr. Uy) would be reduced by one-half starting in August, 2025, and that it would be completely \neliminated in November, 2025 due to the Public Funds Ban.

[Id.] \nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFF AND THE CLASS ARE ENTITLED TO A TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. \n \nIn weighing whether to grant preliminary injunctive relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a), \nโdistrict court[s] must consider: (1) the plaintiffโs likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether \nthe plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction; (3) whether granting the injunction \nwill cause substantial harm to others; and (4) the impact of an injunction upon the public interest.โ  \nAbney v. Amgen, Inc., 443 F.3d 540, 546 (6th Cir. 2006) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting \nDeja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro.

These considerations โare factors to be balanced, \n7 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 8 of 22 - Page ID#: 60\nnot prerequisites that must be met.โ Jones v. City of Monroe, MI, 341 F.3d 474, 476 (6th Cir. 2003) \n(citing In re Delorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d 1223, 1228 (6th Cir. 1985)). And while no single factor \nis dispositive, โa preliminary injunction issued where there is simply no likelihood of success on \nthe merits must be reversed.โ Mich. State v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1249 (6th Cir. 1997). \nSimilarly, whether (or not) to grant a temporary restraining order (โTROโ) under Rule \n65(b) requires courts to consider โthe same four factors applicable to a motion for preliminary \ninjunction.โ Dinter v. Miremami, 627 F. Supp. 3d 726, 730 (E.D. Ky. 2022) (citing McGirr v. \nRehme, 891 F.3d 603, 610 (6th Cir. 2018)). But while the same 4-part analysis applies, โthere is \nincreased emphasis on irreparable harmโ in deciding TROs. Id. (citing ABX Air, Inc. v. Intโl Bhd. \nof Teamsters, Airline Div., 219 F. Supp. 3d 665, 670 (S.D. Ohio 2016)). \n  As is explained below, all of the requisite elements for granting the requested injunctive \nrelief are met in this case. \nA.  There Is A Substantial Likelihood That Plaintiff Will Succeed On The Merits \nOf Her Claims. \n \n  The Eighth Amendmentโs ban on cruel and unusual punishment, as incorporated by the \nFourteenth Amendment, bans state actors โfrom wantonly inflicting pain on prisoners.โ Phillips v. \nTangilag, 14 F.4th 524, 534 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986)). \nThis extends to denying adequate medical treatment. See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 510-11 \n(2011) (โJust as a prisoner may starve if not fed, he or she may suffer or die if not provided \nadequate medical care. A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate \nmedical care, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized \nsociety.โ) And in that context, courts apply a two-part test consisting of both an objective and \nsubjective component. As to the former, courts look to whether the inmate faced โa risk of \nsufficiently serious harmโ from the deficient care. Phillips, 14 F.4th at 534 (citing Farmer v. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 9 of 22 - Page ID#: 61\nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1970)). Thus, the prisoner must show that she has an objectively \nโseriousโ medical need. Id. at 534 (citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103โ04 (1976)). The \nexistence of โ[a] serious medical need alone can satisfy this objective element if doctors effectively \nprovide no care for it.โ Id. (citing Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 737 (6th Cir. 2018)). But where \nsome care is provided, the prisoner must also establish that the allegedly deficient care โis so \ngrossly incompetent or so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience or be intolerable to \nfundamental fairness.โ Id. at 535 (cleaned up). \n  The subjective component requires that the state official must โknow of and disregard the \nserious medical need.โ Id. (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 838โ39). This generally requires that \nthe inmate show that the official knew โof the facts that show the serious medical need and [] \npersonally conclude[d] that this need exists,โ and that the official then โconsciously disregard[ed]โ \nthe need. Id. (citing Jones v. Muskegon County, 625 F.3d 935, 941 (6th Cir. 2010)). This โdeliberate \nindifferenceโ analysis lies โsomewhere between the poles of negligence. . . and purpose or \nknowledge  .  .  .โ  Farmer,  511  U.S.  at  836.  But  even  though  this  requires  establishing \nโconsciousness of a risk,โ it does not require showing that the official โacted or failed to act \nbelieving that harm would befall an inmate; it is enough that the official failed to act despite his \nknowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm.โ Id. at 842. Moreover, โa factfinder may conclude \nthat a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that it was obvious.โ Id. And \nacting in compliance with a law or policy does not preclude a finding that the official was \ndeliberately indifferent. See Johnson v. Sanders, 121 F.4th 80, 92 (10th Cir. 2024) (โWhere a \ndefendant has subjective knowledge that a course of action or inaction required by policy creates \nor fails to address a serious risk to an inmateโs health or safety, he may not escape constitutional \nliability by disregarding such risk in compliance with the policy. In such circumstances, the \n9 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 10 of 22 - Page ID#:\n62\nConstitution demands more of state actors charged with overseeing the carceral punishment of a \nconvicted prisoner.โ). \n  Here, Plaintiff and the proposed class have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits \nbecause both the objective and subjective elements of their Eighth Amendment claims are met. \n    1.  Gender Dysphoria is an objectively serious medical need. \n  First, Gender Dysphoria is an objectively serious medical need, as other courts have found \n(or assumed) and as government officials have conceded in other jurisdictions.2 See, e.g, Johnson \nv. Sanders, 121 F.4th 80, 89 (10th Cir. 2024) (assuming, without deciding, that gender dysphoria \na serious medical need under the Eighth Amendment); Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., 935 F.3d 757, 785 \n(9th Cir. 2019) (โThe State does not dispute that Edmoโs gender dysphoria is a sufficiently serious \nmedical need to trigger the Stateโs obligations under the Eighth Amendment. Nor could it. Gender \ndysphoria is a serious ... medical condition that causes clinically significant distressโdistress that \nimpairs or severely limits an individualโs ability to function in a meaningful way.โ) (cleaned up); \nGibson v. Collier, 920 F.3d 212, 219 (5th Cir. 2019) (โHere, the State of Texas does not appear to \ncontest that Gibson has a serious medical need, in light of his record of psychological distress, \nsuicidal ideation, and threats of self-harm [from a gender dysphoria diagnosis]โ); Mitchell v. \nKallas, 895 F.3d 492, 498 (7th Cir. 2018) (in Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference case, \nnoting that the โstate defendants do not dispute that Mitchellโs gender dysphoria is a serious \nmedical conditionโ).  \n \n2   Indeed, almost thirty years ago the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in an unpublished \ndecision also concluded that โa complete refusal by prison officials to provide [an inmate] with \nany treatment [for gender dysphoria] at all would state an Eighth Amendment claim for deliberate \nindifference to medical needs.โ Murray v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 106 F.3d 401 (Table), 1997 WL \n34677, at *3 (6th Cir. 1997) (unpublished). \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 11 of 22 - Page ID#:\n63\n  This conclusion is supported by the distinguishing characteristics of the diagnosis itself, \nwhich include โclinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other \nimportant areas of functioning.โ DSM-5-TR. [See also Karasic Decl., at ยถ 46.] Indeed, the Ky. \nDepartment of Corrections has recognized it as a serious medical for many years and has, through \nits medical providers, treated the condition by prescribing Plaintiff and sixty-six other individuals \nHRT care for it.

Thus, Gender Dysphoria is a โmedical need [that] is sufficiently seriousโ because โit has \nโbeen diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment.โ Smith v. Franklin Cnty., 227 F. Supp. 2d \n667, 676 n. 10 (E.D. Ky. 2002) (cleaned up); Phillips v. Tangilag, 14 F.4th 524, 534 (6th Cir. \n2021) (noting that an objectively serious medical need can be shown where โa doctor has \ndiagnosed a condition as requiring treatment or that the prisoner has an obvious problem that any \nlayperson would agree necessitates care.โ) (citing Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d 462, 476 (6th Cir. \n2013)). \n2.  The Public Funds Ban deprives Plaintiff and the class of adequate \nmedical care. \n \nMoreover, the Public Funds Ban for HRT care operates as a complete denial of treatment \nfor Gender Dysphoria for Plaintiff and the class given that: (a) they are individuals for whom such \ncare is medically indicated, (b) they have been prescribed and received HRT care under the \nsupervision of licensed healthcare professionals while in DOCโs custody, (c) the HRT care they \nhave been receiving has been (or imminently will be) permanently terminated as a result of \nDefendantsโ enforcement of KRS ยง 197.280 as opposed to the exercise of medical judgment or any \n11 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 12 of 22 - Page ID#:\n64\npatient-specific  considerations,  and  (d)  there  is  no  clinically  significant  alternative  to  HRT \ntreatment for those for whom it is medically indicated. [Compl., at ยถยถ 1, 4,6, 22-27, 30-32, 41; \nPlaintiff Decl., at ยถยถ 13-16; Karasic Decl., at ยถยถ 28-31, 63-66, 77-81.] In this regard, then, the \npermanent cessation of care (previously determined to be necessary and adequate by healthcare \nproviders) for non-medical reasons constitutes a complete denial of care. See, e.g., Parks v. \nBlanchette, 144 F. Supp. 3d 282, 313 (D. Conn. 2015) (finding that cessation of HIV/AIDS \nmedication for ten months did not constitute a โcomplete denial of treatmentโ under the Eighth \nAmendment because it was โtemporaryโ and accompanied by monitoring, and thus more properly \nanalyzed as an โinterruption in careโ). Indeed, courts have found blanket prohibitions on gender \naffirming care, including HRT, a complete denial of care that satisfies this component. See, e.g., \nJones v. Bondi, No. 25-cv-401-RCL, 2025 WL 923755, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 3, 2025), appeal \npending, No. 25-5101 (D.C. Cir.) (granting preliminary injunction against BOP blanket ban on \nHRT); Keohane v. Fla. Depโt of Corr. Secโy, 952 F.3d 1257, 1266-1267 (11th Cir. 2020); Fields \nv. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 559 (7th Cir. 2011)); Hicklin v. Precynthe, No. 16-CV-01357, 2018 WL \n806764, at *11-13 (E.D. Mo. Feb. 9, 2018) (granting preliminary injunction where health care \nprovider had policy of refusing to provide HRT).   \n    3.  Defendants are aware of the subjective medical need posed by Gender \nDysphoria, and they are consciously disregarding the risk of harm \nposed by complying with the Public Funds Ban on HRT care. \n \nBecause this action asserts only official capacity claims against DOC officials and a Monell \nclaim against a corporate entity, application of the Eighth Amendmentโs โsubjectiveโ element is \nless focused on Defendantsโ personal conscious disregard of the risk of harm, and more on the \ninstitutional knowledge (and disregard) of it. See, e.g., Hadix v. Johnson, 367 F.3d 513, 526 (6th \nCir. 2004) (โIn this case, we are concerned with future conduct to correct prison conditions. If \n12 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 13 of 22 - Page ID#:\n65\nthose conditions are found to be objectively unconstitutional, then that finding would also satisfy \nthe subjective prong [of the deliberate indifference standard] because the same information that \nwould lead to the courtโs conclusion was available to the prison officials.โ); Castro v. Cnty. of Los \nAngeles, 833 F.3d 1060, 1076 (9th Cir. 2016) (โThe Supreme Court has strongly suggested that \nthe deliberate indifference standard for municipalities is always an objective inquiry.โ). \nHere, the evidence adequately establishes sufficient subjective awareness and conscious \ndisregard of the medical need posed by Plaintiffโs and the proposed classโs Gender Dysphoria \ndiagnosis and the risks of harm created by failing to treat it with HRT because: (a) DOC previously \nwithheld HRT care from Plaintiff in 2015, but it reversed course the following year after its Health \nCare Administration Review Team reviewed Plaintiffโs case and agreed that her HRT treatment \nshould be resumed [Compl., at ยถ 38-40]; (b) since 2016, Plaintiff received HRT care under the \nsupervision of DOC-provided healthcare providers while in DOCโs custody [id.]; (c) as of 2025, \nsixty-seven (67) individuals in DOCโs custody, including Plaintiff, were receiving HRT care to \ntreat their Gender Dysphoria; and (d) ARH, through its employees Dr. Uy and APRN Ferguson, \nhave been providing HRT care to treat Plaintiffโs (and other inmatesโ) Gender Dysphoria. [Id. at \nยถยถ 15, 40-41.]  \nMoreover,  Defendantsโ  enforcement  of  KRS  ยง  197.280(2)  and  (3)  by  reducing  and \nterminating HRT care for Plaintiff and the entire class constitutes a cessation (for non-medical \nreasons) of medical care that has been prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider to ameliorate \nthe risks of severe harm associated with failing to treat Gender Dysphoria. Such intentional \ntermination of already-prescribed treatment for non-medical reasons sufficiently establishes the \nsubjective prong of the deliberate indifference standard. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104โ\n05 (1976) (โWe therefore conclude that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of \n13 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 14 of 22 - Page ID#:\n66\nprisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the Eighth \nAmendment. This is true whether the indifference is manifested by prison doctors in their response \nto the prisonerโs needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical \ncare or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.โ) (cleaned up); Darrah v. \nKrisher, 865 F.3d 361, 372 (6th Cir. 2017) (โWe have previously held that when prison officials \nare aware of a prisonerโs obvious and serious need for medical treatment and delay medical \ntreatment of that condition for non-medical reasons, their conduct in causing the delay creates a \nconstitutional infirmity.โ) (cleaned up); Durham v. Kelley, 82 F.4th 217, 230 (3d Cir. 2023) \n(โIndifference to a substantial risk of serious harm is manifested by an intentional refusal to \nprovide care, delayed medical treatment for non-medical reasons, denial of prescribed medical \ntreatment, or a denial of reasonable requests for treatment that leads to suffering or risk of injury.โ) \n(emphasis added); Monmouth Cty. Corr. Institutional Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 346 (3d \nCir. 1987) (โ[I]f necessary medical treatment is delayed for non-medical reasons, a case of \ndeliberate indifference has been made out.โ (citations omitted)); Ancata v. Prison Health Servs., \nInc., 769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir. 1985) (same). \nNor does the fact that the Public Funds Ban is a statutory requirement absolve Defendants \nfrom Eighth Amendment liability. As noted in Johnson, 121 F.4th at 91โ92, โ[w]here a defendant \nhas subjective knowledge that a course of action or inaction required by policy creates or fails to \naddress a serious risk to an inmateโs health or safety, he may not escape constitutional liability by \ndisregarding such risk in compliance with the policy.โ Indeed, โalthough compliance with policy \nbears on a defendantโs state of mind, it is not dispositive because correctional policy does not \ndefine the rights and obligations enshrined in the Constitution.โ Id.; see also Mitchell v. Kallas, \n895 F.3d 492, 498 (7th Cir. 2018) (โFailing to provide care for a non-medical reason, when that \n14 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 15 of 22 - Page ID#:\n67\ncare was recommended by a medical specialist, can constitute deliberate indifference.โ) (citing \nPerez v. Fenoglio, 792 F.3d 768, 778 (7th Cir. 2015)). \n  B.  Plaintiff and the class will be irreparably harmed absent an injunction \nโIrreparable harm is an โindispensableโ requirement for a preliminary injunction, and in the \nabsence of irreparable harm, injunctive relief cannot be granted.โ Beckerich v. St. Elizabeth Med. \nCtr., 563 F. Supp. 3d 633, 643 (E.D. Ky. 2021) (citing D.T. v. Sumner Cnty. Schs., 942 F.3d 324, \n326 (6th Cir. 2019)). To establish irreparable harm, a plaintiff must โshow certain and immediate \nharm, not speculative or theoretical harm that would result in the absence of granting injunctive \nrelief. Id. (cleaned up). \nHere, that standard is met. Plaintiff has received notice of the imminent reduction and \ntermination of her HRT healthcare due to KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3), which also mandates the \nimmediate or imminent termination of HRT care for all other class members by barring any direct \nor indirect use of public funds for it. [Compl., at ยถยถ 1, 4, 6, 24-27, 30-32, 45-46, 50; Plaintiff Decl., \nat ยถยถ 13-16.] This denial of gender-affirming HRT care for Plaintiff and the class, after having \nbeen prescribed it by licensed medical providers, has caused or will imminently cause (and will \ncontinue causing) irreparable harm in the form of: exacerbation of their Gender Dysphoria and the \nclinically significant distress associated with it, increased risk of depression, anxiety, self-harm \n(including attempts to self-castrate), and suicidality. [Plaintiff Decl., at ยถยถ 13-16; Karasic Decl., at \nยถยถ 26, 30, 48, 68, 76, 79-82.] See also Edmo, 935 F.3d at 797-98 (โsevere, ongoing psychological \ndistressโ and a โhigh risk of self-castration and suicideโ constitute irreparable harm).  \nFurther, absent the requested injunctive relief, Plaintiff and the class will also suffer \nirreparable harm via the deprivation of their Eighth Amendment rights that are at issue. See, e.g., \nOverstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urb. Cnty. Govโt, 305 F.3d 566, 578 (6th Cir. 2002) (โCourts have \n15 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 16 of 22 - Page ID#:\n68\nalso held that a plaintiff can demonstrate that a denial of an injunction will cause irreparable harm \nif the claim is based upon a violation of the plaintiffโs constitutional rights.โ); ACLU of Ky. v. \nMcCreary Cnty., Kentucky, 354 F.3d 438, 445 (6th Cir. 2003) (โ[I]f it is found that a constitutional \nright is being threatened or impaired, a finding of irreparable injury is mandated. In other words, \nthe first factor of the four-factor preliminary injunction inquiryโwhether the plaintiff shows a \nsubstantial  likelihood  of  succeeding  on  the  meritsโshould  be  addressed  first  insofar  as  a \nsuccessful showing on the first factor mandates a successful showing on the second factorโ\nwhether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm.โ). \n  C.  The balance of hardships and public interest favor granting an injunction \n  The last two factors to consider in weighing whether to grant a TRO or preliminary \ninjunction are: balance of hardships and whether the public interest is served. But these two factors \nโmerge when the government is the defendant.โ Commonwealth v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, 556 (6th \nCir. 2023) (citing Wilson v. Williams, 961 F.3d 829, 844 (6th Cir. 2020)). And where, as here, \nplaintiff establishes โa substantial likelihood of success on the merits and imminent irreparable \ninjuries,โ the government defendant โfaces a high hurdle in showing that these factors warrant \nwithholding relief.โ Id. \n  The  balance  of  hardships  strongly  favors  Plaintiff  and  the  class  because  absent  an \ninjunction that blocks enforcement of the Public Funds Ban as it relates to HRT care, the harm \nPlaintiff and class members have suffered and will continue to suffer will be substantial. Every \nday without access to the necessary Gender Dysphoria treatment (that many, including Plaintiff, \nhave been receiving for years) will exacerbate the clinically significant distress that accompanies \nthe diagnosis, and it will further negatively impact their mental health as well as increase the risk \n16 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 17 of 22 - Page ID#:\n69\nof suicidality and self-harm.

McMillian, 503 \nU.S. 1, 6 (1992); see also Kerr v. Holsinger, 2004 WL 882203, at *10 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 25, 2004 \n(noting that โthe balance of hardships favors Plaintiffs for the harm that the Defendants will suffer \nif an injunction is entered against them, in the form of financial costs, is clearly less than the harm \nthat the Plaintiffs will suffer if their request is denied and they are denied medical treatmentโ). \n  Finally, the public interest also weighs in favor of Plaintiff because the public has an \ninterest in ensuring the continued dignity of incarcerated individuals, and โinherent in that dignity \nis the recognition of serious medical needs, and their adequate and effective treatmentโ pursuant to \nthe Eighth Amendmentโs mandated standard of care.โ Porretti v.

Michigan Liquor Control Commโn, 23 \nF.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994) (citing Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 383 \n(1979)); see also Doe v. McHenry, 763 F. Supp. 3d 81, 90 (D. D.C. 2025) (in granting TRO on \nbehalf of transgender inmates, nothing that โit is hard to cognize of any public interest in the \nimmediate cessation of their hormone therapyโaside, perhaps, from whatever small sum of \nmoney the [Bureau of Prisons] may save by ceasing administration of these drugs, or the abstract \ninterest in the enforcement of Executive Branch policy decisions.โ). \n17 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 18 of 22 - Page ID#:\n70\nD.  The requested relief satisfies the requirements of the Prison Litigation \nReform Act. \n  In addition to being warranted under the traditional preliminary injunction factors, the \nrequested injunctive relief is also consistent with the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which requires \nthat: \nIn any civil action with respect to prison conditions . . .the court may enter a \ntemporary  restraining  order  or  an  order  for  preliminary  injunctive  relief. \nPreliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than \nnecessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the \nleast intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. The court shall give substantial \nweight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice \nsystem caused by the preliminary relief and shall respect the principles of comity \nset  out  in  paragraph  (1)(B)  in  tailoring  any  preliminary  relief.  Preliminary \ninjunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date that is 90 days after its entry, \nunless the court makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the entry \nof prospective relief and makes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day \nperiod. \n \n18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3626(a)(2). \nHere, Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to alleviate the imminent and ongoing harm posed by \ndepriving her and the putative class of adequate healthcare for a serious medical need that they \nhave been receiving (in many instances for years) under the care of licensed healthcare providers \nwhile incarcerated. [Compl., at ยถยถ 1, 4, 6, 26-27, 35-41; Plaintiff Decl., at ยถยถ 14-17.] Specifically, \nPlaintiff seeks an injunction barring Defendants, their agents, employees, and officials from \nenforcing KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) as it relates to HRT care. [See attached Proposed Order.] \nPlaintiff is not seeking injunctive relief to bar enforcement of the statuteโs proscription of sex-\nreassignment surgery, nor injunctive relief from the Court mandating that providers deliver specific \nhealthcare. Rather, Plaintiff seeks only that limited injunctive relief enjoining enforcement of the \nPublic Funds Ban as it relates to HRT thereby removing the statutory obstacle to Defendants being \nable to continue to provide (or to be able to provide in the first instance) HRT care for the treatment \nof Gender Dysphoria for those for whom it is medically indicated. See, e.g., Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n18 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 19 of 22 - Page ID#:\n71\n935 F.3d 757, 783 (9th Cir. 2019); Tay v. Dennison, 457 F. Supp. 3d 657, 690 (S.D. Ill. 2020). The \nCourt may enter class-wide injunctive relief either by provisionally certifying a class or based on \nits general equity powers. Doe v. Burlew, 740 F. Supp. 3d 576, 586-87 (W.D. Ky. 2024) (entering \npreliminary injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of Kentucky statute against entire putative \nclass); Rodriguez v. Providence Providence Cmty. Corr., Inc., 155 F. Supp. 3d 758, 767 (M.D. \nTenn. 2015). To the extent the Court believes provisional class certification is necessary, Plaintiff \nincorporates by reference Plaintiffโs Motion for Class Certification [RE 3: Mot. to Certify Class], \nand for the same reasons supporting class certification, the court should provisionally certify the \nclass and appoint Plaintiffโs counsel as interim class counsel. In either event, the requested \ninjunctive relief would, by necessity, apply statewide. But because DOC operate facilities across \nthe Commonwealth, and because individuals diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria are housed at \nvarious state, county, and local facilities, the scope of the injunctive relief is still narrowly drawn \nand extends no further than necessary. See, e.g., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979) \n(โ[T]he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation establishedโ).  \n  As such, there is no basis upon which to conclude that the requested injunctive relief would \nnegatively impact either public safety or the operation of the criminal justice system given that: \n(a) DOC previously withheld HRT care from Plaintiff in 2015, but it reversed course in 2016 and \nPlaintiff has received HRT care under the supervision of DOC-provided licensed healthcare \nproviders continuously since that time while in DOCโs custody [Compl., at ยถยถ 38-40; Plaintiffโs \nDecl., at ยถยถ 8-11.]; (b) as of 2025, sixty-seven (67) individuals in DOCโs custody, including \nPlaintiff, were receiving HRT care to treat Gender Dysphoria [Compl., at ยถยถ 1, 6]; and (d) ARH, \nthrough its employees Dr. Uy and APRN Ferguson, have been providing HRT care to treat \n19 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 20 of 22 - Page ID#:\n72\nPlaintiffโs (and other inmatesโ) Gender Dysphoria. [Id. at ยถยถ 1, 15, 39-41; Plaintiffโs Decl., at ยถยถ \n11, 13-17.] \n  Indeed, the resumption HRT care for Plaintiff and for those others for whom it is medically \nindicated could not jeopardize public safety because if that were the case, then Plaintiff and the \nproposed class members would not have received it for the past several years. Similarly, delivery \nof healthcare to Kentucky inmates has no impact upon the administration of the criminal justice \nsystem. It does, of course, carry with it administrative costs, but no more than have been born by \nthe Defendants over the past several years since DOC recognized Gender Dysphoria as a serious \nmedical need and HRT care a necessary and appropriate treatment for some who are diagnosed \nwith it.  \nII.  NO BOND SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE INJUNCTION \nFinally, Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) provides that a โcourt may issue a preliminary injunction or a \ntemporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers \nproper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined \nor restrained.โ But as this court has noted, โ[w]hile Rule 65 appears to require a security bond, the \nCourt has discretion over whether to require the posting of security.โ Tennessee v. Cardona, 737 \nF. Supp. 3d 510, 571 (E.D. Ky. 2024) (citing Moltan Co. v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 55 F.3d \n1171, 1176 (6th Cir. 1995)). \nWhere, as here, plaintiffs establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and the \npublic interest favors granting the requested injunctive relief, courts, including this one, often \ndecline to require a security under Rule 65(c). See, e.g., id. at 571 (โthe Court concludes that no \nsecurity is necessary in this matter due, in large part, to the strength of the plaintiffsโ case and the \nstrong public interest favoring the plaintiffsโ positions.โ); Parton v. Parton, 2022 WL 2292984, at \n20 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 4     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 21 of 22 - Page ID#:\n73\n*9 (E.D. Ky. June 24, 2022) (in declining to require bond under Rule 65(c), noting that the \nโstrength of the movantโs case and the public interest involved can weigh against requiring a \nbond.โ); Dinter v. Miremami, 627 F. Supp. 3d 726, 734 (E.D. Ky. 2022) (declining to require bond \nwhere TRO factors favor granting it and where plaintiff proceeding in forma pauperis); Joseph v. \nJoseph, 2015 WL 13861416, at *3 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 21, 2015). As in those instances, no bond \nshould be required in this prisoner suit for declaratory and injunctive relief only. \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion \nfor a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction. \n \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n  /s William E.

[R. 7.]  They seek to intervene as of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n24(a) or, alternatively, by permission pursuant to Rule 24(b).  Id.  For the reasons that follow, the \nCourt will GRANT the Commonwealthโs motion. \nI \n  This case was originally filed on July 14, 2025.  [R. 1.]  The Plaintiff challenged the \nconstitutionality of Kentuckyโs Public Funds Ban as it relates to the Plaintiffโs ability to receive \nHormone Replacement Therapy in prison.  As relief, she seeks to permanently enjoin the \nDefendants from enforcing the Public Funds Ban as it relates to the Plaintiff and her proposed \nclass, as well as a declaratory judgment finding the Public Funds Ban unconstitutional.  Id. at 19.  \nThe Plaintiff has also filed a Motion for a TRO, Preliminary Injunction, and class certification.  \n[R. 4; R. 7.]  On July 16, 2025, this Court considered and ultimately denied the Plaintiffโs request \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 13     Filed: 07/18/25     Page: 2 of 4 - Page ID#:\n152\n \nfor a TRO.  [R. 5.]   The Preliminary Injunction Motion and Class Certification Motion remain \npending before this Court on an expedited briefing schedule.     \n  On July 16, 2025, only two days after this case was filed, the Commonwealth of \nKentucky filed their motion to intervene.  [R. 7.]  The Commonwealth โmoves the Court to \npermit it to intervene in this action as a Defendant to defend this legislation against the Plaintiffโs \nclaims.โ  Id. at 1.  Per the Scheduling Conference, no party objects to the Commonwealth \nintervening in this action.  This matter is now ripe for review.  \nII \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 provides for two types of intervention: intervention of \nright and permissive intervention. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)-(b). The Commonwealth argues that \nit is entitled to intervene under either subsection.  [R. 7 at 2.]  Because the Court finds that \npermissive intervention is warranted, it need only address the partiesโ arguments as to subsection \n(b).  See League of Women Voters of Mich. v. Johnson, 902 F.3d 572, 577 (6th Cir. 2018) \n(โ[T]he Congressmen claim they are entitled to both intervention of right and permissive \nintervention.  Because the Congressmen are entitled to permissive intervention, we address only \nthose arguments.โ).  Pursuant to Rule 24(b)(1)(B), โ[o]n timely motion, the court may permit \nanyone to intervene who . . . has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common \nquestion of law or fact.โ  โIn exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the \nintervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original partiesโ rights.โ  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 24(b)(3).  \n  The Court first addresses timeliness.  When assessing timeliness, the Court considers five \nfactors:  \n1) the point to which the suit has progressed; 2) the purpose for which \n2 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 13     Filed: 07/18/25     Page: 3 of 4 - Page ID#:\n153\n \nintervention is sought; 3) the length of time preceding the application during \nwhich the proposed intervenors knew or should have known of their interest in the \ncase; 4) the prejudice to the original parties due to the proposed intervenorsโ \nfailure to promptly intervene after they knew or reasonably should have known of \ntheir interest in the case; and 5) the existence of unusual circumstances militating \nagainst or in favor of intervention. \n \nBlount-Hill v. Zelman, 636 F.3d 278, 284 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting Jansen v. City of Cincinnati, \n904 F.2d 336, 340 (6th Cir. 1990)).  โNo one factor is dispositive, but rather the โdetermination \nof whether a motion to intervene is timely should be evaluated in the context of all relevant \ncircumstances.โโ  Id. (quoting Stupak-Thrall v. Glickman, 226 F.3d 467, 472-73 (6th Cir. 2000)). \n  Ultimately, the Court finds that intervention is timely.  The case has been pending for \nthree days. No party has argued they would be prejudiced from intervention, nor does the Court \nfind that any prejudice exists. The Attorney General, who is tasked with defending the laws of \nthe Commonwealth against constitutional challenges, has a clear interest in defending against the \nPlaintiffโs claims.  See KRS ยง 15.020(3).  On balance, these factors indicate that the Motion to \nIntervene is timely, and no unusual circumstances affect that balance.   \n  Attorney General Coleman asserts that he is entitled to intervene under Rule 24(b)(1)(B), \nwhich allows intervention if the intervenor โhas a claim or defense that shares with the main \naction a common question of law or fact.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B).  The Commonwealth  \nโseeks to intervene as a Defendant specifically to address the constitutional challenge the \nPlaintiff raised in the complaint.โ  [R. 7 at 6.]  No party questions this assertion and the Court \nfinds intervention to be proper.  The Court will therefore permit Attorney General Coleman to \nintervene on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Rule 24(b)(1)(B).  \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 13     Filed: 07/18/25     Page: 4 of 4 - Page ID#:\n154\n \nIII \n  Accordingly, and the Court being otherwise sufficiently advised, it is hereby ORDERED \nas follows: \n(1) The Motion to Intervene [R. 7] is GRANTED; \n(2) An expedited briefing schedule for the Preliminary Injunction is forthcoming; and \n(3)  The Commonwealth may file an answer or otherwise respond to the Plaintiffโs complaint \nwithin 30 days of the entry of this order. \n \n  This the 18th day of July, 2025.\n \n \n \n   \n4 \n ",

R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2) \n \n  Defendants Appalachian Regional Healthcare, Inc. (โARHโ) and the Commonwealth of \nKentucky ex rel. Attorney General Russell Coleman (the โAttorney Generalโ) oppose class \ncertification, but they fail to rebut Plaintiffsโ demonstration that the requirements of Rule 23 are \nsatisfied.1 [R. 22; R. 29.] First, Defendants contend that the number of putative class members is \ntoo small and that joinder would be practical. [R. 22, at PageID# 333-335; R. 29 at PageID# 439-\n445.] This argument fails because it ignores the ample case law that provides that a class this size \ntypically meets the numerosity requirement, and because it fails to account for the other factors \n \n1   Defendants Crews and Burkett, in their official capacity as Kentucky Department of \nCorrections (โDOCโ) officials, filed no opposition to the Motion for Class Certification. \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 2 of 12 - Page ID#:\n485\nused  to  determine  whether  joinder  would  be  impracticable.  Next,  Defendants  contend  that \nPlaintiff2 fails to satisfy the commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements because of the \nneed for individualized medical assessments. [R. 22, at PageID# 335-338; R. 29, at PageID#446-\n452.] Those arguments likewise fail because they ignore the actual challenge at issue. Here, \nPlaintiff challenges Kentuckyโs blanket prohibition in KRS ยง197.280(2) and (3), banning the use \nof public funds to provide Hormone Replacement Therapy for incarcerated individuals (the \nโPublic Funds Banโ), as violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. [R. 1.] Plaintiff \nchallenges the system-wide law that precludes that treatment for a class of individuals for whom \nthe individualized assessment for that very treatment has already been (or will be) performed by \nthe medical providers hired by the Kentucky Department of Corrections. Plaintiff meets all the \nrequirements for class certification under Rule 23, and class certification is not only permissible; \nit is the most appropriate and efficient way to resolve the same legal claims for the numerous \npeople in the proposed class โ all of whom will be denied the same medical care that they would \nreceive absent the Public Funds Ban.  \n \n2 Plaintiff respectfully requests the parties use Ms. Marcumโs preferred pronouns of she/her. \nUsing partiesโ preferred pronouns is a practice incorporated into many state and federal local \nrules of practice because it cultivates fairness and equal treatment, the appearance of the same, \nand earns the publicโs trust and confidence. The U.S. Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit have \nadopted the practice of using partiesโ preferred pronouns, See e.g. Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., \nGeorgia, 590 U.S. 644 (2020); Santos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. 411 (2023); Fedder v. CEMS \nof Ohio, Inc., No. 24-3028, 2024 WL 5319224 (6th Cir. Nov. 6, 2024); Dijon v. Cent. Ohio \nTransit Auth., No. 22-3884, 2023 WL 4080153 (6th Cir. June 20, 2023); Siefert v. Hamilton \nCnty., 951 F.3d 753 (6th Cir. 2020); Cummings v. Greater Cleveland Reg'l Transit Auth., 865 \nF.3d 844 (6th Cir. 2017); Nash v. United States, No. 17-3739, 2018 WL 3424999 (6th Cir. Jan. \n10, 2018).  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 3 of 12 - Page ID#:\n486\nI.  CERTIFICATION OF A PLAINTIFF CLASS IS APPROPRIATE. \nA.  The Class Definition Is Adequately Defined. \nThe Attorney General asserts that the class definition is too vague. [R. 29, at PageID# 430-\n438.] Instead of explaining how the definition is imprecise, he focuses his argument on whether \nthe use of HRT is appropriate. [Id.] Such an argument is misplaced in this case, and certainly \nmisplaced in the context of a motion for class certification. As an initial matter, the class is defined \nto include only those for whom a medical provider has determined or will determine HRT is \nmedically appropriate and would be entitled to receive such care but for the Public Funds Ban. [R. \n3.] Plaintiff and the current class members have already been prescribed and given HRT by the \nDOC. [R. 24, at PageID #350 (โAPRN Ferguson and Dr. Uy have recommended HRT for Ms. \nMarcum as well as other inmates with Gender Dysphoriaโ); R. 24-2; R. 24-3.] While the Attorney \nGeneral argues Plaintiffโs assertion of โmedical necessity [and Eighth Amendment claim] rests \nentirely on the declaration of Dr. Dan Karasicโ [R. 29, at PageID# 436], the record demonstrates \notherwise. Indeed, the endocrinologist hired to provide recommended treatments to the DOC for \nindividuals diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, submitted an affidavit stating that โ[b]ased solely \non medical considerations, I believe Marcum should continue the [HRT] as indicated in Nurse \nFerguson's May 28, 2025, note as long as it is medically indicated.โ [R. 24-2, at PageID #372.] \nThus, the government itself has answered the question of whether the care is currently medically \nindicated and necessary. The class consists of those individuals, like Plaintiff, for whom DOC or \nits contractors have recommended HRT. There is nothing vague or unknown about that definition \nnor does it require a separate individualized assessment. Those assessments have already been \ndone. Indeed, the objective criteria is the same for those class members as it is for Marcumโ\nwhether the individual would be receiving HRT absent the Public Funds Ban based on a medical \nproviderโs assessment. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 4 of 12 - Page ID#:\n487\nB.  The Numerosity Requirement is Satisfied. \n  Both the Attorney General and ARH contend that a class of at least 67 individuals \nincarcerated throughout Kentucky (few of whom, if any, would possess the necessary resources to \nengage private counsel and litigate this issue) is insufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement. \n[R. 22, at PageID#333-335; R. 29, at PageID# 438-440.] Yet that argument ignores well-settled \nlaw throughout this Circuit. \nThe  numerosity  requirement  is  not  a  strict  test  nor  is  there  a  specific  threshold  as \nDefendants concede. [R. 22, at PageID #334; R. 29, at PageID# 438,440.] The question is whether \njoinder of all members is impracticable. While the requirement is frequently satisfied by the \nnumbers alone, โ[i]n determining practicability, a court should also consider the geographic \ndispersion of the proposed class, the sophistication of proposed class members, and the reluctance \nof individual class members to sue.โ Woodcock v. Correct Care Sols., LLC, No. 3:16-CV-00096-\nGFVT, 2019 WL 3068447, at *4 (E.D. Ky. July 12, 2019) (citing 7A Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice and Procedure ยง 1762 (3d. ed.)). Courts frequently agree that requiring incarcerated \npeople to separately challenge a government policy would be inappropriate based on these factors. \nDodson v. CoreCivic, No. 3:17-CV-00048, 2018 WL 4776081, at *2 (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 3, 2018) \n(โas to the ability of the class members to pursue individual actions, inmates often pursue pro se \nactions, but the Court notes that prisoners often have limited opportunities to litigate their \ngrievances. Moreover, separate, individual actions for the specific injunctive relief sought here \ncould result in overlapping and even inconsistent rulings.โ); Ackerman v. Washington, No. CV 13-\n14137, 2018 WL 3980876, at *1โ2 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 21, 2018); Taber v. McCracken Cnty., No. \n5:06-CV-144-R, 2008 WL 5101684, at *4 (W.D. Ky. Nov. 26, 2008) (โThe Court also recognizes \nthat the nature of the class members, current and former inmates, would likely increase the \ndifficulty of joinder.โ).  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 5 of 12 - Page ID#:\n488\nNotwithstanding Defendantsโ contention that the class is geographically concentrated, the \nclass members are housed in various facilities throughout the state. [R. 22, at PageID# 334-335; \nR. 29, at PageID# 439.] Defendants cite no authority suggesting that a state-wide class of \nincarcerated individuals has ever been construed as โpracticalโ for joinder purposes. Cf. Woodcock, \n2019 WL 3068447, at *5 (certifying a class of incarcerated individuals and noting โthe geographic \ndispersion of the potential members across the state of Kentuckyโ).  \nThe likelihood of these putative class members bringing individual lawsuits is also low, \nparticularly in light of the filing fee, which is not waived for indigent prisoners (although it can be \npaid incrementally). See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915. โMoreover, these individuals are unlikely able to afford \ncounsel to represent them and finding pro bono counsel is difficult. Judicial economy therefore is \npromoted by joining their claims in one action.โ Ackerman, 2018 WL 3980876, at *1โ2. Even if \nplaintiffs had the sophistication and resources to bring their claims individually, plaintiffs may be \ndeterred from doing so given the waiver of medical confidentiality that it entails and the prospect \nof being subjected to public scorn and ad hominem attacks. [R. 29 at PageID 450-451, n.4; R. 20-\n1 at Page ID# 249-50, ยถยถ 153-60.] \nDefendant ARH also contends that Plaintiff relies on speculation and hearsay in claiming \nthere are 67 current class members. [R. 22, at PageID# 332, n.1, 334.] Defendants, however, ignore \nthe news article referencing legislative testimony from Justice and Safety Cabinet general counsel \nLeah Boggs. There is no reason for the Court to reject such a statement.3  \n \n3   To the extent the Court requires additional evidence of numerosity to decide this motion, \nPlaintiff respectfully requests the opportunity to conduct limited discovery on that point. Indeed, \nboth ARH and the Attorney General concede that the number of individuals in DOC custody \nwho are receiving HRT to treat Gender Dysphoria are โeasily identifiable.โ [R. 22, at PageID \n#335; R. 29, at PageID #439 (same).] \n   \n5 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 6 of 12 - Page ID#:\n489\nFinally, while the Attorney General spends significant time attempting to claim that courts \nin the Sixth Circuit have not adopted the generally accepted proposition that 40 or more class \nmembers typically satisfies the numerosity requirement, this Court has made that very observation. \n[R. 29, at PageID# 439-442.] In Estes v. Willis & Brock Foods, Inc., this Court explained the \nnumerosity (and other standards) were โeasily met. The class included 120 members, three times \nthe number of members typically sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement.โ Estes v. Willis \n& Brock Foods, Inc., No. 6:18-CV-00197-GFVT, 2022 WL 697976, at *5 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 8, 2022) \n(citing Lott v. Louisville Metro Gov't, No. 3:19-CV-271-RGJ, 2021 WL 1031008, at *10 (W.D. Ky. \nMar. 17, 2021)). See also Snead v. CoreCivic of Tennessee, LLC, No. 3:17-CV-0949, 2018 WL \n3157283, at *11 (M.D. Tenn. June 27, 2018) (โThis court has observed that as few as forty class \nmembers may satisfy the numerosity requirement.โ). \nC.  The Commonality and Typicality Requirements of Rule 23(a) are met. \n  Throughout  their  opposition  briefs,  Defendants  contend  that  the  typicality  and \ncommonality requirements of Rule 23(a) are not satisfied because of the fact-specific medical \ncircumstances of each class member. [See, e.g., R. 22, at PageID# 336-37; R. 29,  at PageID# 447, \n449.] These arguments ignore the  objective nature of the putative class and demonstrate a \nfundamental misunderstanding of the allegations.4  This case is about a blanket policy prohibiting \nthe use of public funds for certain treatments recommended by the medical staff hired by the \nDepartment of Corrections. Such an action challenging the constitutionality of a systemwide policy \nis uniquely suited for class certification. See J.B-K-1 v. Meier, No. 3:18-CV-00025-GFVT, 2020 \n \n4   See, e.g., R.22, at PageID #336 (ARH asserting (incorrectly) that Plaintiff and the class are \nalleging that they โare entitled to class-wide injunctive relief compelling the Defendants to provide \nclass members with gender-affirming hormone treatments.โ). Neither Plaintiff nor the class seek \nthat relief. [R. 1; R. 4.]  \n6 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 7 of 12 - Page ID#:\n490\nWL 1227761, at *6, n.2 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 13, 2020) (โ[m]any courts have held that when the legality \nof the defendant's standardized conduct toward all members of the proposed class is at issue, the \ncommonality factor is ordinarily metโ) (citations omitted). \nAccording to Defendants, because this case involves a claim that turns on both objective \nand subjective factors, the individual inquiries required under such analysis render commonality \nand typicality impossible. [R. 22, at PageID# 336; R. 29, at PageID# 432-433.] Accepting such an \nargument would suggest that courts could never certify classes that are challenging government \npolicies under the Eighth Amendment. Yet even a cursory review of the caselaw demonstrates that \ncourts both in this Circuit and others do, in fact, certify classes in such circumstances. See, e.g., \nParsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 686 (9th Cir. 2014); Postawko v. Missouri Depโt. of Corr., No. 2:16-\nCV-04129-NKL, 2017 WL 3185155 (W.D. Mo. July 26, 2017), 2017 WL 3185155, at *14; Butler \nv. Suffolk Cnty., 289 F.R.D. 80, 101 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) class of prisoners \nalleging systemic Eighth Amendment violations). \nThis Court also rejected these same arguments a few years ago in Woodcock v. Correct \nCare  Solutions,  LLC,  explaining  that  the  common  question  was  whether  the  policies  and \nprocedures  regarding  treatment  of  individuals  diagnosed  with  a  medical  condition  (chronic \nHepatitis C Virus) constitute deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. Woodcock, 2019 \nWL 3068447, at *5.  \nMoreover, in two recent challenges to a similar government policy against hormone \ntherapy in prisons, both a district court in Idaho and in the District of Columbia certified a similar \nclass. In Robinson v. Labrador, 747 F. Supp. 3d 1331, 1334-37 (D. Idaho 2024), the court found \nthat  the  commonality  and  typicality  requirements  were  met  despite  similar  claims  that \n7 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 8 of 12 - Page ID#:\n491\nindividualized  medical  assessments  would  be  necessary.  With  respect  to  commonality,  the \nLabrador court noted: \nThe Act imposes a blanket prohibition on hormone therapy, even for those to whom \nsuch  therapy  has  been  prescribed  by  a  medical  professional.  Whether  this \nprohibition is medically unacceptable as to those who would otherwise be eligible \nand whether it requires prison medical personnel to consciously disregard excessive \nrisks to the health of the proposed class members are questions common to the \nproposed class. If these questions are answered in the affirmative, the Act violates \nthe Eighth Amendment rights of the class. If answered in the negative, the class's \nclaim will fail. While the individual medical circumstances of each inmate may \nvary, the settlement of these questions will resolve issues central to the validity of \neach of the class membersโ claims โin one stroke.โ Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350, 131 \nS.Ct. 2541.  \n \n747 F. Supp. 3d at 1345 (footnote omitted). \nThe court in Kingdom v. Trump reached the same conclusion regarding commonality and \ntypicality using the very logic Plaintiff asks this court use. There, the court agreed that the plaintiffs \nwere not seeking to mandate defendants give any given person a specific diagnosis or treatment, \nholding that โthe questions that the plaintiffs do present, i.e., whether a uniform policy prohibiting \npeople with a given medical condition from receiving a certain treatment for that condition violates \nthe  Eighth  Amendment  or  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  are  amenable  to  judicial \nconsideration without the Court wading into a thousand personalized medical assessments.โ \nKingdom v. Trump, No. 1:25-CV-691-RCL, 2025 WL 1568238, at *14 (D.D.C. June 3, 2025) \n(emphasis in original).  \nD.  The Named Plaintiff Will Fairly And Adequately Protect The Interests Of \n    The Class. \n  Both Defendants also argue that Plaintiff is not an adequate class representative because \nher medical needs and injuries are not typical of the rest of the class. [R. 22, at PageID #336, R. \n29, at PageID# 448-452.] That argument fails for the same reasons it fails under the commonality \nand typicality requirement โ the issue is not an individualized harm or medical need. See Gen. Tel. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 9 of 12 - Page ID#:\n492\nCo. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158 n. 13 (1982) (โ[Commonality and typicality] also tend to \nmerge with the adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter requirement also raises \nconcerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts of interestโ); Woodall v. Wayne Cnty., \nNo. 20-1705, 2021 WL 5298537, at *4 (6th Cir. Nov. 15, 2021) (โthe adequacy of representation \nrequirement  can  merge  with  the  commonality  and  typicality  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)โ); \nBeckhart v. Jefferson Cnty. Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ., No. 3:15-CV-00751-GNS-CHL, 2017 WL \n4125758, at *5 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 18, 2017). Indeed, adequacy is satisfied because Plaintiff and \nproposed class members all face the same exact legal injury โ an unconstitutional denial of \nprescribed medical treatment from the challenged law.5  \nE.  Class Certification Under Rule 23(b)(2) Is Proper \nCivil rights cases involving unconstitutional, class-based discrimination are paradigmatic \nRule 23(b)(2) examples. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 361 (2011) (cleaned \nup); Doster v. Kendall, 48 F. 4th 608, 615 (6th Cir. 2022). Rule 23(b)(2)โs requirements are met \nwhen, as here, members of a proposed class seek uniform relief from a policy or law that is \ngenerally applicable to the class as a whole. Here, Plaintiff seeks relief from the Public Funds Ban \nwhich is generally applicable to the class. Defendants nevertheless claim it does not apply \nuniformly because an individualized assessment or inquiry into the medical needs of each class \nmember would be required to determine the appropriate relief. [R. 22 at 8; R. 29 at 27-28.] Again, \nPlaintiff is not challenging DOCโs individualized assessments given only those individuals who \nhave been prescribed or would be prescribed HRT are members of the class. Plaintiff is challenging \n \n5 The Attorney General, however, goes further โ and outside the traditional two-prong criteria \nused in the Sixth Circuit โ attempting inappropriately to malign Plaintiff. [R. 29, at PageID# 450-\n452.] The facts of the two cases the Attorney General relies on are wholly inapplicable and there \nis simply no basis to suggest that Plaintiff is unwilling to vigorously prosecute the case. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 10 of 12 - Page ID#:\n493\nthe Public Funds Ban which is a blanket prohibition on HRT. Indeed, Defendantsโ arguments \nnecessarily misconstrue the nature of the claims and ignore the multiple courts that have certified \nclasses under Rule 23(b)(2) in cases involving Eighth Amendment claims in which plaintiffs \nchallenged the constitutionality of a prison policy, including this one. See, e.g., Kingdom v. Trump, \n2025 WL 1568238, at *16 (D.D.C. June 3, 2025) (โRather than reflecting an โindividualized \nassessment,โ this comprehensive, blanket policy to end hormone therapy is the exact type of \nโgenerally applicableโ policy that a Rule 23(b)(2) class action can properly seek to enjoin.โ); \nRobinson,  747  F.  Supp.  3d  at  1348-49  (certifying  Rule  23(b)(2)  class  of  Idaho  prisoners \nchallenging similar Public Funds Ban under Eighth Amendment); Woodcock, 2019 WL 3068447, \nat *8 (in issuing injunctive relief โthe Court would not be โโsecond guessingโ the decisions of \nhealthcare  providersโ as  Defendants  allege.  Instead,  Plaintiffs  request  the  Court  review  the \nestablished procedures to ensure Defendants are providing a standard of care that does not violate \nconstitutional standards.โ) \nFinally, the Attorney General seeks to inject a cautionary warning into this relatively \nroutine and uncontroversial decision by citing a recent non-precedential concurring opinion from \nJustice Alito. [R. 29, at PageID# 454-56.] The only example provided of this alleged โabuseโ is \nthe recent Supreme Court decision in Trump v. J.G.G., 604 U.S. ___, 145 S. Ct 1003, 1005-06 \n(2025), in which the Court never even summarized, questioned, or rejected the lower courtโs class \ncertification. Rather, as the Attorney General concedes, the Supreme Court only vacated the district \ncourtโs decision for lack of venue. Nothing in that decision or any other decision suggests that this \nCourt should depart from a long history of certifying Rule 23(b)(2) classes challenging state-wide \npolicies or laws. Certifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class here is consistent with the analysis conducted in \nthose cases and in no way suggests some hypothetical abuse of this critical civil rights tool.  \n10 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 36     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 11 of 12 - Page ID#:\n494\nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above and in Plaintiffโs Motion, the Court should grant her Motion \nappoint Plaintiff as class representative, and appoint Plaintiffโs counsel to represent the certified \nclass pursuant to Fed.

(โARHโ) and the Attorney General offered substantive responses. [R. 24; R. 20.] \nAnd in those responses, they assert, inter alia, that Plaintiff does not have a substantial likelihood \nof success on the merits of her claims because: (a) Gender Dysphoria is not an objectively serious \nmedical need under the Eighth Amendment [R. 20, at PageID #205-06]; (b) Plaintiff is not entitled \nto a particular form of medical treatment under the Eighth Amendment [id. at PageID #206-07; R. \n24, at PageID #351]; (c) because the Public Funds Ban is enforceable against those for whom HRT \nis not medically indicated, it is not unconstitutional in all of its applications and therefore is facially \nvalid [R. 20, at PageID #203-04], and (d) as to the Monell claim against ARH, the Public Funds \nBan is the source of Plaintiffโs injury, not any corporate policy or practice. [R. 24, at PageID #348, \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 2 of 13 - Page ID#:\n468\n350-51.] And they contest that irreparable harm would result from denying the injunction. [R. 20, \nat PageID #208-210; R. 24, at PageID #352-53.] For the following reasons, Defendants err. \nI.  Gender Dysphoria Is An Objectively Serious Medical Need \nFirst, only the Attorney General asserts that Gender Dysphoria is not an objectively serious \nmedical need. [R. 20, at PageID #205.] But the Attorney General fails to cite any judicial decisions \nadopting such a position.  [Id.] Indeed, extensive caselaw supports that Gender Dysphoria is an \nobjectively serious medical condition, as does the factual record in this case. Specifically, a \nmedical need is โseriousโ for Eighth Amendment purposes where it has โbeen diagnosed by a \nphysician as mandating treatment, or [it is] one that is so obvious that even a lay person would \neasily recognize the necessity for a doctorโs treatment.โ Smith v. Franklin Cnty., 227 F. Supp. 2d \n667, 676 n. 10 (E.D. Ky. 2002) (cleaned up); Phillips v. Tangilag, 14 F.4th 524, 534 (6th Cir. \n2021) (noting that an objectively serious medical need can be shown where โa doctor has \ndiagnosed a condition as requiring treatment or that the prisoner has an obvious problem that any \nlayperson would agree necessitates care.โ) (citing Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d 462, 476 (6th Cir. \n2013)). \nWith respect to the caselaw, many courts have already concluded that Gender Dysphoria \nis an objectively serious medical need for Eighth Amendment purposes. See, e.g., Keohane v. Fla. \nDepโt of Corr. Secโy, 952 F.3d 1257, 1286 (11th Cir. 2020) (โBecause both sides and the majority \nagree that gender dysphoria is an objectively serious medical need, only the subjective element is \nin dispute.โ); Cano v. S.C. Depโt of Corr., 2023 WL 10286851, at *14 (D.S.C. July 31, 2023) \n(โMoreover, the evidence establishes that gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition that \ncauses Plaintiff to suffer from severe psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, urges \nto harm herself, and suicidal ideation.โ), report and recommendation adopted as modified, 2024 \n2 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 3 of 13 - Page ID#:\n469\nWL 1005553 (D.S.C. Jan. 30, 2024); Wright v. Parker, 2022 WL 18586696, at *4 (E.D. Ark. Apr. \n11, 2022) (โThe Eighth Circuit has recognized gender dysphoria as an objectively serious medical \nneed.โ), report and recommendation adopted, 2023 WL 1766461 (E.D. Ark. Jan. 31, 2023); \nHuskins v. Fox, 2018 WL 3660203, at *2 (W.D.N.C. Aug. 2, 2018) (in allowing inmate complaint \nto survive initial review under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915, noting that โ[c]ourts have routinely held that \ngender dysphoria is a serious medical need for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.โ); Gonzalez v. \nTurner, 2025 WL 818183, at *5 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 13, 2025) (finding โthe first prong of the Brawner \ntest is satisfiedโ because โPlaintiff has demonstrated she had a serious medical need during her \nincarcerationโ due to her Gender Dysphoria diagnosis).1 \nMoreover, Defendant ARHโs own employees, Dr. Uy and APRN Ferguson (who provide \ntreatment for Gender Dysphoria to Plaintiff and members of the proposed class), confirm that in \ntheir medical opinions Plaintiff should continue with her HRT care for the treatment of her Gender \nDysphoria diagnosis. [See R. 24, at PageID #350 (noting that โAPRN Ferguson and Dr. Uy have \nrecommended HRT for Ms. Marcum as well as other inmates with Gender Dysphoria.โ); R. 24-2: \nDr. Uy Aff., at PageID #372 (noting that โ[b]ased solely on medical considerations, [she] believes \n[that Plaintiff] should continue the Estradiol [Hormone Therapy] as indicated in Nurse Fergusonโs \nMay 28, 2025, note as long as it is medically indicated.โ); R. 24-3: APRN Ferguson Aff., at PageID \n#376 (same); see also R. 24, at PageID #350 (โAPRN Ferguson and Dr. Uy continue to believe \nthat the standard of care for Ms. Marcum is to continue gender-affirming therapy, yet they must \n \n1   It also cannot be reasonably disputed that the evidence establishes that Plaintiff has been \ndiagnosed with Gender Dysphoria. [See R. 24-2, at PageID #371 (โIt is my understanding that \nPlaintiff Maddilyn Marcum (โMarcumโ) has been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria by a mental \nhealth professional.โ); R. 24-3, at PageID #375 (same); R. 24-Sealed Exh. 4, at p. 5 (noting receipt \nof โpsych letter documenting gender dysphoriaโ diagnosis).] \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 4 of 13 - Page ID#:\n470\nalso consider the patientโs reality of the eventual statutorily required end of funding for gender-\naffirming therapy.โ).] \nDr.  Karasicโs  declaration  also  supports  the  conclusion  that  Gender  Dysphoria  is  an \nobjectively serious medical need. In it, he notes that Gender Dysphoria โis a serious condition \nwhich, if left untreated, can impair a personโs ability to function and cause significant depression, \nanxiety, self-harm and suicidality.โ [R. 4-1, at PageID #81 (emphasis added); id. at PageID #94.] \nSee also Troutman v. Louisville Metro Depโt of Corr., 979 F.3d 472, 482 (6th Cir. 2020) \n(โPsychological  needs  may  constitute  such  โserious  medical  needsโ  particularly  when  those \npsychological needs โresult in suicidal tendencies.โโ) (quoting Horn v. Madison Cty. Fiscal Ct., 22 \nF.3d 653, 660 (6th Cir. 1994)). And, indeed, even the Attorney Generalโs own proffered expert \nacknowledges that Gender Dysphoria is: (a) โa psychological diagnosis with a key feature of \ndistressโ [R. 20-1, at PageID #223]; and (b) the โpersistent state of distress that stems from the \nfeeling that oneโs gender identity does not align with oneโs physical sex.โ [Id.] \nRelatedly, the Attorney Generalโs attempt to discredit the risk of harm associated with \nwithholding HRT from those for whom it is medically indicated is likewise insufficient to \nundermine the conclusion that Gender Dysphoria is an objectively serious medical need. [R. 20, \nat  PageID  #205-06.]  First,  even  if  the  evidence-based  World  Professional  Association  for \nTransgender Healthโs Standards of Care (WPATH SOC) 8 guidelines regarding the treatment of \nGender Dysphoria were widely disputed, the necessity of using HRT as a treatment for those \ndiagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and for whom it is medically indicated is also supported by the \nclinical practice guideline from the Endocrine Society. [R. 4-1, at PageID #87-88, 92.] And the \nโ[g]ender-affirming medical interventions provided in accordance with the WPATH SOC 8 and \nEndocrine Society Guidelines are widely recognized in the medical community as safe, effective, \n4 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 5 of 13 - Page ID#:\n471\nand medically necessary for many people with Gender Dysphoria.โ [R. 4-1, at PageID #92.] For \nthose individuals, โno alternative treatments have been demonstrated to be effective.โ [Id. at \nPageID #92-94.] \nPlaintiff (and the putative class members) have been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, a \nmedical condition for which Dr. Uy and APRN Ferguson have recommended HRT treatment and \nfor which Plaintiff and the class have been receiving HRT treatment while in DOCโs custody. \nGiven their diagnosis, and because of the substantial risks of harm that result if that diagnosis is \nleft untreated, Gender Dysphoria is an objectively serious medical need for Eighth Amendment \npurposes. [R. 4-1, at PageID #81-82.] \nII.  Defendants  Improperly  Conflate  Individualized  Medical  Decisions  With  The \nRequested Injunctive Relief.  \n \n  Further,  the Attorney  General  and ARH  attempt  to  shift  the  Courtโs  focus  onto  the \navailability of alternative forms of treatment for Gender Dysphoria, and the fact that the Eighth \nAmendment does not guarantee a particular form of treatment. [R. 20, at PageID #207-08; R. 24, \nat PageID #351-52.] True enough. But Plaintiff does not seek court-ordered relief mandating that \nDOC officials (or ARHโs employees) prescribe and administer HRT to herself and the putative \nclass members. [R. 4, at PageID #70.] That is (or should be) an individualized medical decision. \nAnd Plaintiffโs medical providers have already determined that HRT is medically indicated to treat \nher (and othersโ) Gender Dysphoria, as is evidenced by the fact that Plaintiff and the putative class \nmembers have been receiving HRT while in DOCโs custody and by the affidavits of Dr. Uy and \nAPRN Ferguson. [See R. 24, at PageID #350 (โAPRN Ferguson and Dr. Uy have recommended \nHRT for Ms. Marcum as well as other inmates with Gender Dysphoria.โ); R. 24-2; R. 24-3.] \nMoreover, Dr. Uy and APRN Ferguson have confirmed Dr. Karasicโs opinion that HRT, where \nmedically indicated, is appropriate to treat Gender Dysphoria. [Compare R. 24-2, at PageID #372 \n5 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 6 of 13 - Page ID#:\n472\nand R. 24-3, at PageID #376 with R. 4-1, at PageID #81-82, 88-92.] And they both also recommend \nthat Plaintiff continue on HRT at the May 28, 2025 dosage level โas long as it is medically \nindicated.โ [R. 24-2, at PageID #372; R. 24-3, at PageID #376.] \n  Rather, Plaintiff seeks limited injunctive relief blocking enforcement of the statutory \nobstacle to her providers being able to continue providing the care  that they have already \ndetermined (and presently maintain) is medically appropriate for her and those who have been \nreceiving it, as well as for those future prisoners for whom it would be medically indicated. [R. 1: \nCompl., at PageID #2, 19; R. 4; R. 4-3.] And the availability of adequate alternative treatments for \nsome  individuals  diagnosed  with  Gender  Dysphoria  is  immaterial  to  those for whom  such \nalternative treatments are not adequate (and for whom their providers have determined that HRT \nis medically indicated and appropriate), as is the case for Plaintiff and the putative class.2 \nThus, Defendantsโ argument that the Public Funds Ban on HRT is permissible because \nPlaintiff and the putative class members can receive some other alternative treatments in lieu of \nHRT is misplaced because: (a) their treating providers have already made (or would make for \nfuture class members) the individualized medical determination that HRT is, indeed, medically \n \n2   The assertion by the Attorney General that the Public Funds Ban does โnot bar the \nprescribing, distribution, or use of HRT by inmatesโ is without merit because it misapprehends the \nscope of the statuteโs reach. [R. 20, at PageID #206.] KRS ยง 197.280(1)(b)(1) includes within the \ndefinition of public funds โany money, regardless of the original source of the money, of [t]the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof.โ And the \nPublic Funds Ban contained in subsection (2) mandates that โpublic funds shall not be directly or \nindirectly used, granted, paid, or distributed for the purpose of providing,โ inter alia, HRT. \nBecause prisoners are wholly dependent upon the Commonwealth and its agents for prescribing, \ndistributing, and dispensing medication within correctional facilities, the Public Funds Ban is a de \nfacto ban on HRT as a form of treatment within the DOC. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103  \n(1976) (โAn inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail \nto do so, those needs will not be met.โ). [See also R. 24-2, at PageID #371 (stating that starting in \nApril, 2025, ARH providers were notified by DOC that due to KRS ยง 197.280, โgender affirming \nmedication would not  be administered by the DOC going forward.โ).] \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 7 of 13 - Page ID#:\n473\nindicated and appropriate to treat their Gender Dysphoria, and (b) the Public Funds Ban erects a \nblanket ban on that form of medical treatment for current individuals who have been receiving it \n(and for future individuals for whom it would otherwise be appropriate) that is untethered to any \nmedical justification and irrespective of any contrary medical judgment. That type of categorical \ndenial of a form of medical treatment deemed necessary and appropriate by the medical community \nfor some individuals necessarily violates the Eighth Amendment rights of those prisoners for \nwhom such treatment is medically indicated. See, e.g., Soneeya v. Spencer, 851 F. Supp. 2d 228, \n247 (D. Mass. 2012) (โWhile the implementation of some procedure for dealing with treatment \nrecommendations for patients with [Gender Identity Disorder] is undoubtedly an improvement, \nthe policy is flawed in that it creates blanket prohibitions on some types of treatment that \nprofessional and community standards indicate may sometimes be necessary for the adequate \ntreatment of [Gender Identity Disorder]. This blanket ban on certain types of treatment, without \nconsideration of the medical requirements of individual inmates, is exactly the type of policy that \nwas found to violate Eighth Amendment standards in other cases both in this district and in other \ncircuits.โ) (emphasis added) (citing Kosilek v. Moheny, 221 F.Supp.2d 156, 193 (D. Mass. 2002); \nDeโLonta v. Angelone, 330 F.3d 630, 635 (4th Cir. 2003); Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 558-59 \n(7th Cir. 2011)). \nIII.  Plaintiff Has A Substantial Likelihood Of Establishing That The Public Funds Ban  \nAs It Relates To HRT Is Facially Unconstitutional. \n \n  The Attorney General also asserts (incorrectly) that Plaintiff is unlikely to prevail on her \nfacial challenge to the Public Funds Ban because she cannot show โthat no set of circumstances \nexists under which the Act would be valid.โ [R. 20, at PageID #203 (quoting U.S. v. Gore, 118 F.4th \n808, 811 (6th Cir. 2024).] The Attorney General reasons that because โthere are persons who are \ndiagnosed with gender dysphoria who are not prescribed HRT and who do not need HRTโ [id. at \n7 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 8 of 13 - Page ID#:\n474\nPageID #203], then the statute is constitutional โin at least some applications.โ [Id.] But that misses \nthe mark because โwhen assessing whether a statute meets this standard, the Court has considered \nonly applications of the statute in which it actually authorizes or prohibits conduct.โ City of Los \nAngeles, Calif. v. Patel, 576 U.S. 409, 418 (2015) (emphasis added). \n  Here, the purportedly constitutional applications of the statute advanced by the Attorney \nGeneral relate to individuals for whom it has no applicability. Specifically, the Public Funds Ban \n(as it applies to HRT) is a non-factor for those individuals for whom HRT is not medically indicated \nbecause  their providers will not  prescribe HRT for  them. Thus, their medical  care will  be \nunaffected by the statute. See Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 557 (7th Cir. 2011) (in rejecting \ngovernmentโs argument that HRT ban facially valid because it applies equally to all prisoners, \nnoting that the challenged statute โis irrelevant to inmates who are not diagnosed with severe GID \nand in medical need of hormonesโ). \nThe fact that the Public Funds Ban is inapplicable to that group of individuals does not \nsave it from a facial challenge here by Plaintiff and a class of individuals whose medical care is \naffected by the Public Funds Ban. โLegislation is measured for consistency with the Constitution \nby its impact on those whose conduct it affects.... The proper focus of the constitutional inquiry is \nthe group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.โ Patel, \n576 U.S. at 418 (cleaned up). When properly viewed, therefore, Plaintiff has a substantial \nlikelihood of succeeding on her facial challenge to the Public Funds Ban on HRT care because it \nimposes a blanket ban on a form of medical treatment that is (and has been) deemed necessary and \nappropriate for Plaintiff and the putative class. [R. 4, at PageID #60-67; R. 24-2; R. 24-3.] See \nSoneeya, 851 F. Supp.2d at 247; Mitchell v. Kallas, 895 F.3d 492, 498 (7th Cir. 2018) (โFailing to \nprovide care for a non-medical reason, when that care was recommended by a medical specialist, \n8 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 9 of 13 - Page ID#:\n475\ncan constitute deliberate indifference.โ) (citing Perez v. Fenoglio, 792 F.3d 768, 778 (7th Cir. \n2015)). \nIV.  Because  Plaintiff  Has  Established A  Substantial  Likelihood  Of  Success  In  Her \nChallenge To The Public Funds Ban Relating To HRT, ARHโs Argument Contesting \nHer Likelihood Of Success On The Merits Of Her Monell Claim Is Misplaced. \n \nARH  also  opposes  this  motion  on  the additional  basis  that  Plaintiff cannot  show  a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits of her Monell claim against it. [R. 24, at PageID \n#348-51.] But whether (or not) Plaintiff has established a likelihood of success on her Monell claim \nat this pre-discovery stage is immaterial because under Rule 65, โ[t]he moving party need only \nshow a likelihood of success on the merits on one claim where there are multiple claims at issue \nin a complaint.โ Planned Parenthood Great Nw., Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, & Kentucky, Inc. v. \nCameron, 599 F.Supp.3d 497, 506 (W.D. Ky. 2022) (citing Transtex Composite, Inc. v. Laydon \nComposite, Ltd., 2012 WL 5362191, at *2 (W.D. Ky. Oct. 30, 2012); Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. \nSchiavo, 357 F.Supp.2d 1378, 1384 (M.D. Fla.), affโd, 403 F.3d 1223 (11th Cir. 2005) (โPlaintiffs \nhave asserted five constitutional and statutory claims. To obtain temporary injunctive relief, they \nmust show a substantial likelihood of success on at least one claimโ); 725 Eatery Corp. v. City of \nNew York, 408 F. Supp. 3d 424, 459 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (โPlaintiff need not demonstrate a likelihood \nof success on the merits of every claimโrather, they need only โshow a likelihood of success on \nthe merits of at least one of [their] claims.โโ)). \nMoreover, although Plaintiffโs Class Action Complaint references seeking preliminary \ninjunctive relief to enjoin the challenged corporate policy, practice, or custom of ARH [R. 1, at \nPageID #19], Plaintiffโs (narrowly tailored) preliminary injunction motion instead seeks only to \nenjoin Defendantsโ enforcement of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) insofar as the statute imposes a \nblanket ban on HRT care. [R. 4; R. 4-3, at PageID #125.] \n9 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 10 of 13 - Page ID#:\n476\nV.  Plaintiff Has Established The Requisite Irreparable Harm That Would Result From  \nDenying The Requested Injunctive Relief. \n \n  Finally, both the Attorney General and ARH assert that the claimed harm that Plaintiff and \nthe putative class would suffer from being denied HRT care (that they are currently (or were) \nreceiving under the care of their healthcare providers prior to the passage of KRS ยง 197.280) is \nโspeculativeโ at best, and in any event does not rise to the level of irreparable harm. [R. 20, at \nPageID #208-10; R. 24, at PageID #352-53.] But that is incorrect.  \n  Plaintiff has established that she was first diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria in 2009, and \nthat since commencing HRT soon afterwards she saw that care play a โlife-saving roleโ in her \nwell-being. [R. 4-2, at PageID #117-18.] Further, she identified the serious adverse health effects \nshe suffered from being denied her HRT care during her period of pre-trial detention and upon \ninitially being transferred to DOCโs custody. [Id. at PageID #118.] She suffered various physical \nailments, and her psychological health also deteriorated to the point of her suffering from โdeep \ndepressionโ and persistent suicidal ideations. [Id.] And she identified the positive health effects \nshe experienced after DOC reversed course in 2016 and approved a comprehensive treatment plan \nfor her that included HRT care. [Id. at PageID #119.] \n  Dr. Karasic observes that withdrawing or denying gender-affirming medical care for those \nfor whom it is medically indicated โwould put them at risk of significant harm to their health and \nwell-being, including heightened risk of self-harm and suicidality.โ [R. 4-1, at PageID #82, id. at \nPageID #89, 92-94.] And Plaintiffโs own healthcare providers have established that โbased solely \non medical considerations,โ they believe that Plaintiff โshould continue the Estradiol as indicated \nin Nurse Fergusonโs May 28, 2025, note as long as it is medically indicated.โ [R. 24-2, at \nPageID#372; R. 24-3, at PageID #376; see also R. 24, at PageID #346-47 (โThe ARH providersโ \nmedical recommendation would be that the medication be continued for as long as it is medically \n10 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 11 of 13 - Page ID#:\n477\nindicatedโ); id. at PageID #350 (acknowledging that โAPRN Ferguson and Dr. Uy continue to \nbelieve that the standard of care for Ms. Marcum is to continue gender-affirming therapyโ).] \nPlaintiff  thus  adequately  established  irreparable  harm  in  the  increased  physical  and \npsychological injury from denial of gender-affirming HRT care that her providers determined is \nboth necessary and appropriate. See, e.g., Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., 935 F.3d 757, 797โ98 (9th Cir. \n2019) (irreparable harm established from โsevere, ongoing psychological distress and the high risk \nof self-castration and suicideโ). This same analysis also applies to the putative class members who \nDr. Uy and APRN Ferguson also treated with HRT because it is medically indicated, and these \npatients will also be imminently deprived of necessary care because of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3). \n[See R. 24, at PageID #350 (โAPRN Ferguson and Dr. Uy have recommended HRT for Ms. \nMarcum as well as other inmates with Gender Dysphoriaโ); R. 24-2, at PageID #371 (Dr. Uy \nexplaining that starting in April, 2025, ARH providers were advised โthat, due to the passage of \nKRS ยง 197.280, gender affirming medication would not be administered by the DOC moving \nforward.โ).] \n  This harm is not merely โspeculative.โ It is correct that KRS ยง 197.280(3) contains a \nโtaperingโ provision whereby public funds may continue to be used for HRT for those individuals \nfor whom immediate cessation โwould cause physical harm,โ as determined by their health care \nprovider. Despite the fact that โtaperingโ an individualโs HRT is an acknowledgement by the health \ncare provider that immediately terminating the care would cause the person physical harm, the \nstatute nonetheless mandates that the HRT treatment be โsystematically reduced and eliminatedโ \nwithout regard to any medical judgment to the contrary. KRS ยง 197.280(3). There is nothing \nspeculative about the application and enforcement of the Public Funds Ban on HRT. It is being \nused to withdraw HRT care from those individuals for whom it is medically indicated and who \n11 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 34     Filed: 08/04/25     Page: 12 of 13 - Page ID#:\n478\nhave been receiving it, and it is being used (or will be used) to deny HRT care to those future \nindividuals for whom such care is medically indicated. [R. 24, at PageID #346 (โWellpath and \nDOC advised that, due to the new law, gender-affirming medication would not be administered by \nthe detention facilities moving forward and they discussed ways to step the medication down.โ).] \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  forgoing  reasons,  as  well  as  those  contained  in  her  initial  motion,  Plaintiff \nrespectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. \n \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s William E.

[R. 4; R. 34; R.3 ; R. 36.]  \nI.  Likelihood Of Success On The Merits  \nA.  The evidence adequately establishes Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria diagnosis \nThe Attorney General devotes much of his argument to reasserting that Plaintiff has not \nadequately proven that she has been properly diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria. [R. 41, at PageID \n#523-27.] But that is incorrect. \nInitially, it is worth noting that โ[t]he purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to \npreserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held. Given this \nlimited purpose, and given the haste that is often necessary if those positions are to be preserved, \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 2 of 15 - Page ID#:\n623\na preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal \nand evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits. A party thus is not required to \nprove his case in full at a preliminary-injunction hearing.โ Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. \n390, 395 (1981) (emphasis added). See also Blaylock v. Cheker Oil Co., 547 F.2d 962, 965 (6th \nCir.1976) (โ[t]he general function of a preliminary injunction is to maintain the status quo pending \ndetermination of an action on its meritsโ). \nNevertheless,  the  evidence  (and  party  admissions)  already  in  the  record  more  than \nsufficiently establish Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria diagnosis, and it is further supported by the \naccompanying medical records attached as Exhibit 1.1  Specifically, during the approximately ten \n(10) years Plaintiff has been in the custody of the Department of Corrections, she has been housed \nat multiple facilities and seen numerous medical and mental health providers who have noted in \nher records her Gender Dysphoria diagnosis and provided treatment for it. For example, Dr. Uy, a \nlicensed endocrinologist, has been treating Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria since at least October 13, \n2021. [Exh. 1, at Plaintiff_001497.] But the Attorney General, having reviewed those records, says \nthat is not enough. [R. 41, at PageID # 525.]2 \nDr. Uy, of course, has already expressed her professional judgment that continuation of \nPlaintiffโs HRT care at the level recommended on May 28, 2025 is appropriate to treat Plaintiffโs \nGender Dysphoria, as long as it is medically indicated. [R. 24-2, at PageID #372.] Again, the \n \n1   Simultaneous with the filing of this motion, Plaintiff moves for leave to file Exhibit 1 \nunder seal. \n \n2   The Dept. of Correctionsโ healthcare contractor, Wellpath, produced approximately 2,000 \npages of medical records to Plaintiffโs counsel, which the Attorney General then subpoenaed. \nHowever, even a cursory review of those records indicates that there are yearsโ worth of Plaintiffโs \nmedical records absent from Wellpathโs production, including the absent records noted by Dr. \nLaidlaw. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 3 of 15 - Page ID#:\n624\nAttorney General says that is not enough, and he points to the doctorโs statement that it is her \nโunderstandingโ that Plaintiff โhas been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria by a mental health \nprofessional.โ [R. 41, at PageID #525 n.1.] Setting aside the Attorney Generalโs implicit aspersion \nthat Dr. Uy and every other medical provider who has treated Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria did so \neither unnecessarily or without a proper basis, the Attorney General ignores the fact that APRN \nFergusonโs May 28, 2025 note reflects that ARH had โreceived [the] psych letter documenting \n[Plaintiffโs] gender dysphoriaโ diagnosis. [R. 24-Sealed Exh. 4, at p. 5.] That, too, is not enough \naccording to the Attorney General. \nIndeed, the Attorney General further ignores the fact that prior to filing his supplemental \nbrief, the DOC Defendants admitted Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria diagnosis as well as her having \nreceived HRT treatment since 2016 while in DOCโs custody. [See R. 39, at PageID #512 ยถ 38 \n(DOC  Defendants  admitting  that  medical  providers  have  prescribed  HRT  to  treat  Plaintiff \nbeginning in 2016); id. at PageID #512 ยถ 39 (DOC Defendants admitting that Plaintiff has received \nHRT since 2016 while in DOCโs custody); id. at PageID #514 ยถ 55 (same); id. at PageID #514 ยถ \n53 (DOC Defendants admitting that Plaintiff has been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria).] \nSimilarly,  ARH  conceded  in  its  response  brief  that  both  Dr.  Uy  and  APRN  Ferguson \nโrecommended  on  multiple  occasions  that  Ms.  Marcum  receive  gender-affirming  hormone \ntherapyโ [R. 24, at PageID #349], and that they both โbelieve that the standard of care for Ms. \nMarcum is to continue gender-affirming therapy.โ [Id. at PageID #350.] But the party admissions \nof the healthcare company providing specialized care for Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria and the \ngovernmental  agency  that  has  maintained  custody  of  (and  been  responsible  for  providing \nhealthcare to) Plaintiff for approximately ten years is also insufficient per the Attorney General. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 4 of 15 - Page ID#:\n625\nThe Attorney General is similarly unconvinced by the repeated references in Plaintiffโs \nmedical records to her Gender Dysphoria diagnosis (upon which various treatment decisions have \nbeen based for years). [See, e.g., Exh. 1, at Plaintiff_000153 (Licensed Psychologist John E. \nPenezicโs Mar. 1, 2022 SOAP note documenting Plaintiffโs โlong-standing history of gender \ndysphoriaโ); Plaintiff_001476 (Mar. 4, 2022 note reflecting increase in estradiol based on telemed \nEndocrinology order); Plaintiff_0001497 (Dr. Fortwenglerโs Nov. 18, 2021 SOAP note regarding \nchanges to Plaintiffโs HRT care).]  \nHere,  Plaintiff  has  established  with  โsufficient  evidenceโ  her  diagnosis  of  Gender \nDysphoria, and the Attorney Generalโs claims to the contrary are without merit. See, e.g., Plain \nDealer Pub. Co. v. Cleveland Typographical Union No. 53, 520 F.2d 1220, 1228 (6th Cir. 1975) \n(โWhile in a proceeding for preliminary injunction a plaintiff need not prove its case to the same \ndegree as would be required at a trial upon the merits, the record must reflect sufficient evidence \nโฆ to satisfy the โstrong showing of probable success.โโ). \nB.  The weight of medical opinion supports HRT care as a necessary and  \nappropriate treatment for some diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria. \n \nThe Attorney General also seeks to cast doubt on the medical communityโs recognition of \nHRT as an appropriate form of healthcare for Gender Dysphoria, as well as their recognition of it \nas a necessary treatment (without an adequate alternative) for some diagnosed with that condition. \n[R. 41, at PageID #527-29.] The Attorney Generalโs own expert, Dr. Laidlaw, has recently testified \nthat he does not believe that โadults should be obstructed or blocked from receiving, you know, \ngender affirmative hormones or surgeries provided โ provided, again, they have capacity to \nconsent.โ R. 25-6: Laidlaw Depo. Xcript, at 3, Robinson v. Labrador, No. 1:24-cv-00306-DCN \n(D. Idaho 2024) (citing Dr. Laidlawโs deposition testimony from C.P. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield \nof Illinos, 3:20-cv-06145-RJB (W.D. Wash. 2022)). While he also testified that a medical case \n4 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 5 of 15 - Page ID#:\n626\nโcouldโ be made for such treatment harming adults, he declined to opine on it. Id. at 4. So, the \nclaimed medical โuncertaintyโ was not so prevalent then to warrant an adverse opinion from Dr. \nLaidlaw. \nIndeed, there is no genuine medical dispute as to the efficacy, relative safety, and necessity \nof HRT care as a treatment option for Gender Dysphoria for those for whom it is medically \nindicated. [R. 4-1, at PageID #81-82, 85, 88-89.] Indeed, even though the Attorney General \nproffers four articles to purportedly support his proposition that โany necessity for HRT remains \nuncertain,โ [R. 41, at PageID#528], that assertion misconstrues those articles, one of which even \nsupports the proposition that HRT is โan essential component of care.โ First, nothing in the \nAnderson study suggests HRT is an inappropriate or otherwise disputed treatment for gender \ndysphoria in adults. [R. 41-3, at PageID #541 (providing introduction to article stating โPatients \nwith gender dysphoria who receive treatment report happier lives. There is also a decreased rate \nof suicidality among patients who receive appropriate gender affirmation treatment. Treatment \nstarts with hormone therapy.โ).] That article further describes the various treatment options and \nnotes that the treatment should be flexible, and it includes HRT as a valid option. [Id. at PageID \n#543.] \nSimilarly, the Hruz article [R. 41-4] does not suggest that HRT in adults is either ineffective \nor medically unnecessary, and in any event two different courts have found that Dr. Hruz was not \nqualified  to  offer  expert  testimony  regarding  treatment  of  gender  dysphoria.  See Brandt  v. \nRutledge, 677 F. Supp. 3d 877, 916 (E.D. Ark. 2023) (Hruz was โunqualified to offer relevant \nexpert testimony and offered unreliable testimony. [His and other] opinions regarding gender-\naffirming medical care for adolescents with gender dysphoria are grounded in ideology rather than \nscienceโ); Kadel v. Folwell, 620 F. Supp. 3d 339, 364 (M.D.N.C. 2022), vacated on other grounds, \n5 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 6 of 15 - Page ID#:\n627\nFolwell v. Kadel, --- S. Ct. ---, 2025 WL 1787687 (June 30, 2025); see also Koe v. Noggle, 688 F. \nSupp. 3d 1321, 1336 (N.D. Ga. 2023) (noting an amicus brief submitted to the Supreme Court by \nDr. Hruz โcontains other disparaging remarks, including some that associate transgender identity \nwith โdelusionโ and โcharade.โ This kind of inflammatory rhetoricโin a brief submitted to the \nSupreme Court, no lessโcasts doubt on the objectivity of Dr. Hruz's testimony.โ) (cleaned up); \nDoe v. Ladapo, 676 F.Supp.3d 1205, 1210-11 (N.D. Fla. June 6, 2023) (โDr. [Paul] Hruz fended \nand parried questions and generally testified as a deeply biased advocate, not as an expert sharing \nrelevant evidence-based information and opinions. I do not credit his testimony.โ). \nThe Haupt study merely notes the lack of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) of estradiol \nin the treatment of Gender Dysphoria without addressing whether HRT is, in fact, clinically \nineffective or should not be considered medically necessary treatment for Gender Dysphoria. And \nwhile the Attorney General quotes from the Baker article about the lack of studies on the effects \nof hormone therapy on death by suicide, he omits the full conclusion of that study [R. 41, at PageID \n#528 n.4], which actually stands for the proposition that HRT is medically appropriate to treat \nGender Dysphoria. The article concludes stating:: \nDespite the limitations of the available evidence, however, our review indicates that \ngender-affirming hormone therapy is likely associated with improvements in QOL, \ndepression, and anxiety. No studies showed that hormone therapy harms mental \nhealth or quality of life among transgender people. These benefits make hormone \ntherapy an essential component of care that promotes the health and well-being of \ntransgender people. \n \n[R. 41-6, at PageID #592.] \nThus, the record does not demonstrate that there is the type of uncertainty or disagreement \nthat would justify ignoring both Plaintiffโs treating physician and the weight of medical authority. \nAnd as Dr. Karasic has noted, โthe protocols and policies set forth by the WPATH \nStandards of Care and the Endocrine Society are cited as authoritative by the major professional \n6 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 7 of 15 - Page ID#:\n628\nmedical and mental health associations in the United States, including the American Medical \nAssociation . . .the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, \nthe American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the American College of Physicians, and the \nWord Medical Association, among others.โ [Id. at PageID #88.] Moreover, not even the Trump \nadministration disputes that โgender dysphoria exists and that it can have serious manifestations,โ \nand that โhormone therapy is an important method for the treatment of gender dysphoriaโ for some \nwho are diagnosed with it. Kingdom v. Trump, No. 1:25-CV-691-RCL, 2025 WL 1568238, at *2 \n(D.D.C. June 3, 2025) (noting that the parties โagreeโ on these points).  \nThe Attorney General also raises a red herring argument regarding the โoff labelโ use of \nestradiol and spironolactone to treat Gender Dysphoria as purported support for the stateโs ability \nto ban HRT as a treatment option for incarcerated Kentuckians.

Denying prescribed treatment for prisoners diagnosed with a serious medical \nneed pursuant to a blanket policy is a breach of adequate care under the \nEighth Amendment. \n \n The  Attorney  General  improperly  conflates  the  General  Assemblyโs  authority  in \nregulating health and welfare with what has transpired here. [R. 41, at PageID #529 (citing L.W. \nv. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460 (6th Cir. 2023)).] Specifically, KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) erect a blanket \nban on a form of healthcare that is necessary and appropriate for some prisoners diagnosed with \nGender Dysphoria for which there is no adequate alternative.

But the stateโs \nauthority to do so is nonetheless subject to federal statutory and constitutional restraints. See, e.g., \nCity of Covington, Ky. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 708 F. Supp. 806, 807-08 (E.D. Ky. 1989) \n(holding that despite cityโs regulation limiting train speed adopted for public safety and pursuant \nto a state statutory delegation of authority, the federal Railway Safety Act preempted the city \nordinance and rendered void the state statute). In the context of medical care for prisoners, for \nexample, the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee prisoners the right to adequate \n \nconclusions about her credibility and trustworthiness are improper and should be disregarded by \nthe Court.

Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). And the constitutional analysis by which \ndeliberate indifference claims proceed serves as the floor of prisonersโ right to adequate medical \ntreatment; the state is free to provide more protection for prisonersโ rights but it cannot provide \nless. See Commonwealth v. Reed, 647 S.W.3d 237, 256 (Ky. 2022) (โWe recognize the general \nand  well-accepted  legal  principle  that  the  federal  constitution  simply  provides  a  floor  of \nconstitutional protection. While the federal constitution prevails over inconsistent state laws based \non the Supremacy Clause, states are always free to provide expanded constitutional protections to \ntheir citizens in our system of cooperative federalism.โ); WILLIAM J.

But as other courts have recognized, \nโblanket prohibitions on some types of treatment that professional and community standards \nindicate may sometimes be necessary for the adequate treatment of [Gender Identity Disorder]. . \n..without consideration of the medical requirements of individual inmates, is exactly the type of \npolicy that was found to violate Eighth Amendment standards in other cases both in this district \nand in other circuits.โ Soneeya v.

The Irreparable Harm Factor Weighs Heavily In Plaintiffโs Favor.  \n \n  Further, there is ample evidence in the record to find that Plaintiff will suffer irreparable \nharm absent the injunction. Specifically, Plaintiff has established that her diagnosis of Gender \nDysphoria pre-dates her incarceration [R. 4-2], and that it has persisted through her pre-trial \ndetention and while in DOCโs custody.

Class  Certification  Is  Appropriate  And  Should  Be  Granted  Or,  Alternatively, \n  Further Discovery Permitted As To Class Certification. \n \n  First, in again attacking the numerosity element of Rule 23, the Attorney General ignores \nthe facts. Specifically, in January 2025, the Kentucky Department of Corrections identified 67 \nindividuals in its care who, under the care of an endocrinologist, were receiving HRT for the \ntreatment  of  Gender  Dysphoria.  RECORDING  OF  JAN.  13,  2025  SENATE  ADMINISTRATIVE \nREGULATION REVIEW SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING, 47:14โ47:25, at http://www.youtube.com/live/ \n11 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 12 of 15 - Page ID#:\n633\nwM_Tpv3ZRaM?t=2431s (last visited August 8, 2025). Ms. Leah Boggs, General Counsel to the \nKentucky Department of Corrections, acknowledged that prior to passage of SB 2, โinmates have \nreceived hormone therapy for yearsโ while in DOCโs custody. Id. General Counsel Boggs further \ntestified that: \nWhen the inmateโs physicianโand these endocrinologists are independent physicians, they \nare not Department employeesโwhen they say someone needs hormone treatment for \npost-menopause -or- menopause, postpartum depression, low testosterone, any medical \nneedโthatโs when the Department would pay for it. But an independent endocrinologist, \nas far as hormones go โ [like] other drugs, the physician would have to say this is necessary \nto treat a medical need.  \n \nId. at 50:20- 50:55. \n  General Counsel Boggs also testified in January 2025 that there were 12,842 individuals \nhoused in Kentucky Department of Corrections facilities, and 467 of them were receiving hormone \ntherapy for various medical conditions, including Gender Dysphoria. Id. At 51:24 โ 51:50. She \nfurther made clear that โof that [467] number, 67โbased on the independent endocrinologistโs \nrecommendation that itโs a serious medical needโ67 inmates are receiving those hormones for \nGender Dysphoria.โ Id. at 52:06 โ 52:37 (emphasis added). \nPlaintiff is one of the sixty-seven individuals identified by the Kentucky Department of \nCorrections as receiving HRT for Gender Dysphoria based on a serious medical need identified by \nher physician. This class is as easily identifiable today as it was on January 13, 2025, as conceded \nby the Attorney General. [See R. 29, at PageID #439.] General Counsel Boggsโ testimony is \nconsistent with Plaintiffโs previous reports regarding numerosity, and it further establishes that the \ndefined class are all persons who have been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and who have been \nidentified as having a serious medical need for HRT treatment. \nThe Attorney Generalโs argument that class certification requires an individualized medical \nassessment for each putative member is misplaced. [R. 41, at PageID #531-32.] The putative class \n12 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 13 of 15 - Page ID#:\n634\nis limited to individuals for whom an individual assessment has been made, and for whom a \ntreating provider has recommended HRT care to address that serious medical need. The class is \ntherefore narrowly defined and appropriate for certification. Cf. Kingdom v. Trump, No. 1:25-CV-\n691-RCL, 2025 WL 1568238, at *14 (D.D.C. June 3, 2025); Robinson v. Labrador, 747 F. Supp. \n \n3d. 1331, 1334-37 (D. Idaho 2024) (finding numerosity satisfied where more than forty (40), and \npossibly as many as fifty-four (54) prisoners, were identified as having received hormone therapy \nfor Gender Dysphoria prior to enforcement of challenged statute.).4 \nIV.  Counselsโ Decision To Consistently Misgender Plaintiff Is Irrelevant And Should Be \nDisregarded. \n \nFinally, counsel for the Attorney GeneralโLindsey Keiser, Victor Maddox, Justin Clark, \nand Aaron Sillettoโhave (unlike the Court and the other defendantsโ attorneys) consistently \nmisgendered Plaintiff in this action, both in their filings and during oral argument, and even after \nPlaintiff requested that they refrain from doing so. [R. 36, at PageID #485 n.2.]  Their choice to \ndo so is inconsistent with the common practice adopted in the United States Supreme Court and \nthe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals of using partiesโ preferred pronouns. See Bostock v. Clayton \nCnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644 (2020); Santos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. 411 (2023); Fedder v. \nCEMS of Ohio, Inc., No. 24-3028, 2024 WL 5319224 (6th Cir.

Jan. 10, 2018). \n \n4   The remaining  class  certification  factors  have  already  been  adequately  addressed  in \nPlaintiffโs prior briefing and oral argument. [R. 3; R. 36.] However, in the event the Court finds \nthat there is insufficient evidence in the record, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court permit \nlimited discovery on whichever factor(s) are deemed lacking in evidentiary support. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 44     Filed: 08/11/25     Page: 14 of 15 - Page ID#:\n635\nAnd it must be noted that their doing so is neither evidence in the case nor relevant to any issue \nbefore the Court. See Fed. R. Evid. 401; Corder v. Ethicon, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 3d 749, 767 (E.D. \nKy. 2020) (noting that โcounsel argument is not evidence.โ).5  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the forgoing reasons, as well as those contained in her initial motion and reply [R. 4; \nR. 34; R. 3; R. 36], Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction and Motion for Class Certification.6 \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s William E.

Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280, which bans public funds from \nbeing used for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for inmates. The Plaintiff, a prisoner \nreceiving HRT, contends the ban has abrogated certain constitutional rights.  So, the Plaintiff \nasks this Court to invalidate the statute.   \nIn a modest way this is rightfully the business of the Court, but to understand the scope of \nthis authority it is important to state first what the Court is not in the business of doing.  To state \nthe obvious point, the Court does not draft, vote on, or enact lawsโthat responsibility belongs to \nthe Legislature.  Alexander Hamilton referred to the Judiciary as the โleast dangerous branchโ of \ngovernment, not because its decisions lack significance, but because it is not a creative body.  \nThat task lies with the Legislature.  Instead, the judiciary is charged with interpreting and \napplying what already exists within its constitutional framework.  This means even if a judge or \na party disagrees with a law passed by the Legislature, absent a clear constitutional violation, \ncourts should be reluctant to intervene, as they are neither designed nor equipped with the \ninstitutional tools necessary to legislate.  All of this to say, the burden to necessitate judicial \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 2 of 21 - Page ID#:\n802\nintervention in an area typically reserved for the legislature is high.  Apart from disagreeing with \nthe statute, the Plaintiff has not shown at this preliminary stage a constitutional violation that \nwarrants enjoining the enforcement Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280.  Consequently, and for the reasons \nstated below, the Plaintiffโs Motion for Preliminary Injunction [R. 4] is DENIED.  \nI \nThe factual predicate in this case is complex, and at this early juncture, not fully \ndeveloped.  Plaintiff Maddilyn Marcum was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and placed on \nHRT five years prior to Marcumโs incarceration.  [R. 1 at 11.]  To be clear, there is some \ndisagreement between the parties over this fact.  No such diagnosis letter has been entered into \nthe record, nor do the Declarations of the ARH providers unequivocally state that Plaintiff \nMarcum has been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria by a certified mental health professional.  \n[R. 24-2 at 2; R. 24-3 at 2 (โIt is my understanding that Plaintiff Maddilyn Marcum (โMarcumโ) \nhas been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria by a mental health professional.โ) (emphasis \nadded).] \nPrior to Marcumโs sentencing, Marcum was held in a county facility where Marcum was \nnot administered HRT.  Id.  Once in the Department of Correctionsโ (DOC) custody following \nsentencing, Marcum was again refused HRT under the DOCโs โfreeze frameโ policy.  [R. 4 at 6.]  \nUnder the โfreeze frameโ policy, a prisoner is entitled to receive HRT only if they were receiving \nHRT when they entered DOCโs custody.  Id.  Thus, because the county jail refused to provide the \nPlaintiff with HRT during the pretrial incarceration, DOC found that Marcum was not receiving \nHRT prior to entering their custody and was not eligible to receive HRT.  Id.  In 2016, DOC \nreversed course and found that Marcum did qualify for HRT.  Id.  Marcum received treatment \nfrom 2016-2025.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 3 of 21 - Page ID#:\n803\nThe chain of command for DOC healthcare providers is convoluted.  Appalachian \nRegional Healthcare (ARH), who is a Defendant in this action, contracts with Wellpath, who is \nnot a party to this action, to provide telehealth endocrine services to inmates.  [R. 24 at 1.]  \nAmong the services is treatment for Gender Dysphoria.  Id.  ARH, however, does not provide \nany in-person health services to inmates nor does ARH prescribe or administer medicationโthis \njob is left to the Wellpath providers, who are contracted by the DOC.  Id. at 2  \nThe Plaintiffโs ARH providers are Dr. Edilfavia Uy and APRN Bonnie Ferguson. Id.  The \nARH providers are supposed to โreceive a letter from a certified mental health professional that \nan individual has been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria.โ  [R. 24 at 2.]  Prior to any telehealth \nappoints, ARH receives updated lab work from Wellpath along with the patientโs Medication \nAdministration Record.  Id.  After the virtual appointment, the ARH provider sends an Electronic \nHealth Record note to Wellpath, who then sends the note to the inmateโs Wellpath medical \nprovider at the institution.  Id.  At this point, the DOC provider has complete autonomy to either \naccept or reject the recommendation to provide the medication recommended by ARH.  Id.  \nIn 2025, the Kentucky Legislature passed the Public Funds Ban.  [R. 4 at 6.]  Under the \nPublic Funds Ban, โpublic funds shall not be directly or indirectly used, granted, paid, or \ndistributed for the purpose of providing a cosmetic service or elective procedure to an inmate in a \ncorrectional facility.โ  Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280(2).  The statute defines โcosmetic service or \nelective procedureโ as: \nany procedure, treatment, or surgery to enhance or alter the appearance of any \narea of the head, neck, and body, including but not limited to:  \n \n1.  Prescribing or administering cross-sex hormones in amounts greater than \nwould normally be produced endogenously in a healthy person of the same \nage and sex; and  \n2.  Performing any gender reassignment surgery to alter or remove physical or \nanatomical characteristics or features that are typical for a personโs sex in \n3 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 4 of 21 - Page ID#:\n804\norder to instill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that \nresemble a different sex. \n \nKy. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280(1).  All argue that HRT falls squarely into the definition of a โcosmetic \nservice or elective procedureโ as defined by the statute.  See Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280(1)(a)(1).  \nThe statute also affords medical professionals some discretion in determining how best to taper \ntreatment in a manner that minimizes disruption to the inmate.1  Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280(3).    \nAfter the passage of the Public Funds Ban, Wellpath and DOC โadvised that, due to the \nnew law, gender-affirming medication would not be administered by the detention facilities \nmoving forward and they discussed ways to step the medication down.โ  [R. 24 at 3.]  Marcum \nmost recently met with APRN Ferguson via Zoom on May 28, 2025.  [R. 24 at 3.]  At this visit, \nAPRN Ferguson increased Marcumโs Estradiol dosage from 11 milligrams every two weeks to \n13 milligrams every two weeksโalthough her specific reasoning for such a decision is not in the \nrecord.  APRN Ferguson notified Marcum that HRT would be eventually completely eliminated \nconsistent with the Public Funds Ban but did not give a time frame for the discontinuation of \nHRT treatment.2  Id. at 4.  The Plaintiff had a follow-up appointment on August 13, 2025, where \nthe Plaintiff was advised that HRT would be reduced by half and then completely eliminated in \nSeptember 2025.  [R. 11; R. 57-1 at 2.] \nSince the Preliminary Injunction hearing, the Plaintiff has twice supplemented the Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction.  [R. 44; R. 57.]  In the first supplement, the Plaintiff included a \nvariety of physician notes from past doctorโs visits.  Among other things, the notes indicate that \n \n1 The Court notes that the statute does not give a certain time by which treatment must be completely eliminated.  \nWhen asked at the Preliminary Injunction hearing if treatment could be gradually tapered off over the course of five \nyears, the Commonwealth stated that this is a possibility under the statute if determined to be necessary by a medical \nprofessional.  \n2 When asked who determines the timeframe for tapering off the medicine, ARH said the inmate elects whether to \ntaper off or not.  However, the record is not clear how the timeline is set, the role ARH plays in setting the timeline, \nor the effect tapering off treatment has on the inmate. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 5 of 21 - Page ID#:\n805\nthe Plaintiff received treatment for โunspecified gender dysphoriaโ in 2018.  [R. 43 at 3, 18.]  \nThe Plaintiff then filed a second supplement that included a Supplemental Declaration from \nPlaintiff Marcum. [R. 57-1 at 2.]  In the Declaration, the Plaintiff noted \n[O]n August 15, 2025, I met with APRN Shannon Wiles and APRN Rick \nRichards. They are Wellpath employees, and they further clarified that my \nprescribed estrogen dosage would be reduced by one-half (from 11 mg to 5.5 mg) \non August 18, 2025, and that the August 18, 2025 dosage would be the final dose \nof estrogen given to me. They further advised me that beginning August 18, 2025, \nmy dosage of spironolactone would likewise be reduced by one-half (from 200 \nmg daily to 100 mg daily) for a period of one week, and then it, too, would be \ndiscontinued. \n \n[R. 57-1 at 3.] \nMarcum is asking for both a TRO and Preliminary Injunction, as well as a class action \ncertification.  [R. 3; R. 4.]  As grounds, Marcum argues that the Public Funds Ban as it relates to \nthe HRT ban violates the Eighth Amendment, which bans state actors from โโunnecessarily and \nwantonly inflicting painโ on an inmate by acting with โdeliberate indifferenceโ toward the \ninmate's serious medical needs.โ Blackmore v. Kalamazoo Cnty., 390 F.3d 890, 895 (6th Cir. \n2004) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)).  The \nCommonwealth of Kentucky moved to intervene in this action, seeking to defend the \nconstitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280, which this Court granted.  [R. 7; R. 13.]  The Court \ndenied Marcumโs request for a TRO [R. 5] and set an expedited briefing schedule for the \nPreliminary Injunction Motion [R. 14].  Due to the individualized medical nature of this case, the \nCourt also ordered the Plaintiff to produce medical records related to the Plaintiffโs Gender \nDysphoria to Defendants.  [R. 21.]  The Plaintiff and Commonwealth both filed supplemental \nbriefings related to information contained in the medical records.  [R. 41; R. 44.]  The Court held \na preliminary injunction hearing on August 5, 2025, and now the matter is ripe for review.   \n \n5 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 6 of 21 - Page ID#:\n806\n             II \nโA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should be granted only if the \nmovant carries his or her burden of proving that the circumstances clearly demand it.โ  \nOverstreet v. LexingtonโFayette Urban County Government, 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002) \n(citing Leary v. Daeschner, 228 F.3d 729, 739 (6th Cir. 2000)) (cleaned up) (โ[A] preliminary \ninjunction involv[es] the exercise of a very far-reaching power . . .โ)).  Because of the unique \nprocedural posture brought on by a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the Court notes that the \nnature and purpose of a preliminary injunction informs the analysis. As the Supreme Court has \nstated: \nThe purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative \npositions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held. Given this limited \npurpose, and given the haste that is often necessary if those positions are to be \npreserved, a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of \nprocedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on \nthe merits. A party thus is not required to prove his case in full at a preliminary \ninjunction hearing. \n \nUniversity of Texas v. Camenisch, U.S. 390, 395 (1981). Therefore, the findings of fact and \nconclusions of law made by a district court in granting a preliminary injunction are not binding at \na trial on the merits.  Id.  It is through this lens the Court makes the following findings of fact \nand conclusions of law.  \n  To issue a preliminary injunction, the Court must consider whether: (1) the movant shows \na strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the \ninjunction is not issued; (3) the issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; \nand (4) the public interest would be served by issuing the injunction.  Overstreet, 305 F.3d at \n573.  The Sixth Circuit noted that โ[w]hen a party seeks a preliminary injunction on the basis of \na potential constitutional violation, the likelihood of success on the merits often will be the \n6 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 7 of 21 - Page ID#:\n807\ndeterminative factor.โ  City of Pontiac Retired Employees Assโn v. Schimmel, 751 F.3d 427, 430 \n(6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012)).   \nThe parties also seek a Preliminary Injunction that is consistent with the Prison Litigation \nReform Act (PLRA).  The PLRA requires that: \nIn any civil action with respect to prison conditions . . . the court may enter a \ntemporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief. \nPreliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than \nnecessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be \nthe least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. The court shall give \nsubstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a \ncriminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief and shall respect the \nprinciples of comity set out in paragraph (1)(B) in tailoring any preliminary relief. \nPreliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date that is 90 days \nafter its entry, unless the court makes the findings required under subsection \n(a)(1) for the entry of prospective relief and makes the order final before the \nexpiration of the 90-day period. \n \n18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3626(a)(2).  As the relevant statutory provision shows, injunctive relief in the \nprison context has its own special circumstances Courts must consider in conjunction with the \ntraditional Preliminary Injunction factors.  With this framework in mind, the Plaintiff argues that \nthe Public Funds Ban, Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280, is both facially and as-applied unconstitutional.  \n[R. 4 at 2.]   \nA \n1 \n  โA facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount \nsuccessfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which \nthe Act would be valid.โ  United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746 (1987).  โA facial \nchallenge is really just a claim that the law or policy at issue is unconstitutional in all its \napplications.โ  Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U.S. 119, 138 (2019).  The Plaintiff, although not \ndirectly addressing the facial challenge in the Preliminary Injunction motion, does address the \n7 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 8 of 21 - Page ID#:\n808\nargument in the Reply.  [R. 34 at 7.]  Marcum argues that โindividuals [with Gender Dysphoria] \nfor whom HRT is not medically indicated,โ do not fall into the category of people this statute \napplies to and should not be considered when evaluating a facial challenge.  [R. 34 at 8.]   \n  The Plaintiffโs point is well-taken, but this argument is predicated on a finding that all \ninmates who are prescribed HRT medically require HRTโa finding which this record presently \ncannot support.  The Plaintiff attempted to establish that HRT was medically necessary, but the \nprimary showing was that the record is insufficiently developed for the Court to make that \ndetermination. The burden is on the Plaintiff to show a medical necessity and, as detailed below, \nMarcum simply has not.  Because the Court finds that the statute is applied constitutionally to the \nPlaintiff, it logically follows that there exist constitutional applications, such that a facial \nchallenge cannot succeed.    \n  Having found that the facial challenge fails, the Court next turns to the as-applied \nchallenge.  The Eighth Amendment obligates prison authorities to provide medical care to \nincarcerated individuals, as a failure to provide such care would be inconsistent with \ncontemporary standards of decency. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103โ104 (1976). The Eighth \nAmendment is violated when a prison official is deliberately indifferent to the serious medical \nneeds of a prisoner. Id. at 104-05; Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 702 (6th Cir. 2001).  \nThere are two components to an Eighth Amendment claimโthe objective and the subjective. \na \nThe objective component requires a plaintiff to prove that the alleged deprivation of \nmedical care was serious enough to violate the Eighth Amendment.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 \nU.S. 825, 834 (1994).  The plaintiff must present enough evidence for a factfinder to evaluate the \nadequacy of the treatment provided and the severity of the harm caused by the allegedly \n8 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 9 of 21 - Page ID#:\n809\ninadequate treatment. There must be โmedical proof that the provided treatment was not an \nadequate medical treatment of [the inmate's] condition or pain.โ Santiago v. Ringle, 734 F.3d \n585, 591 (6th Cir. 2013). This will often require โexpert medical testimony . . . showing the \nmedical necessity forโ the desired treatment and โthe inadequacy of the treatmentsโ the inmate \nreceived.  Anthony v. Swanson, 701 F. App'x 460, 464 (6th Cir. 2017). \nSome circuits have classified Gender Dysphoria as a serious medical need, but many \nCircuits, including the Sixth Circuit, have not provided guidance.  The closest the Sixth Circuit \nhas come to addressing this issue is Murray v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, where they recognized \ntranssexualism as a medical disorder and noted that โtranssexuals often have a serious medical \nneed for some sort of treatment.โ  Murray v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, No. 955204, 1997 WL \n34677, at *3 (6th Cir. 1997).  At the point Murray was decided, Gender Dysphoria was not yet a \ncoined term.  [R. 20-1 at 10 (โIn 2009, under DSM-IV, the condition concerning a mismatch \nbetween perceived gender identity and biological sex was called โGender Identity Disorder.โ  In \nthe DSM-5, the closest similar condition is called โGender Dysphoria.โ).]  Thus, it is unclear \nunder Sixth Circuit precedent whether Gender Dysphoria is a serious medical need.  \nRegardless, glaringly missing from the record is any indication that the Plaintiff was \nformally diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria.  The Plaintiffโs Declaration, coupled with the \nDeclarations of Dr. Uy and APRN Ferguson, are used as the primary support of the formal \ndiagnosis.  The Plaintiff asserts that the initial diagnosis with Gender Dysphoria was โby a \nhealthcare provider in 2009,โ but Marcum does not name the healthcare provider or provide any \ndocumentation of said diagnosis.  [R. 4-2 at 2.]  Similarly, Dr. Uy and Dr. Ferguson stated that it \nwas their โunderstanding that Plaintiff Maddilyn Marcum (โMarcumโ) has been diagnosed with \nGender Dysphoria by a mental health professional.โ  [R. 27-2 at 2; R. 27-3 at 3.]  In the \n9 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 10 of 21 - Page ID#:\n810\nPlaintiffโs Supplemental Briefing, the Plaintiff recounts several instances of receiving treatment \nfor Gender Dysphoria.  [R. 44.]  Specifically, the Plaintiff notes that APRN Ferguson noted that \nMarcum โreceived psych letter documenting Gender Dysphoria.โ  [R. 27-4 at 5.]   The Court is \nnot entirely sure what this entry meansโis this letter recommending changing the Plaintiffโs pre-\nexisting course of treatment? Is this letter diagnosing the Plaintiff? Or is this letter a routine \nupdate given to providers?  \nFurther, neither of the Plaintiffโs supplements change the fact that the record remains \nunderdeveloped.  The physician notes indicate that the Plaintiff was diagnosed with โunspecified \ngender dysphoriaโ dating back to 2018.  It is not clear whether โunspecified gender dysphoriaโ is \ndifferent from โgender dysphoria.โ  Regardless, the first supplement simply provides additional \nevidence of the factual predicate that this Court does not disputeโthat the Plaintiff has been \nreceiving treatment for Gender Dysphoria.   \nThe second supplement, which indicates that the Plaintiff has stopped receiving HRT, \nlikewise does not fill in the gaps in the Plaintiffโs arguments.  Most importantly, the statute as \nwritten, and as confirmed by the Government, leaves room for medical discretion to be exercised \nwith respect to tapering off treatment.  The Plaintiff attempts to argue that that the termination of \nHRT โis not based upon individualized medical judgmentโ because APRN Ferguson โdoes not \nmedically recommend this course of action.โ  [R. 57-1 at 2.]  The obvious problem with this \nassertion is, based on the Plaintiffโs Supplemental Declaration, APRN Ferguson was not \ninvolved in terminating Plaintiffโs HRT treatmentโAPRN Wiles and APRN Richards were the \nproviders who informed the Plaintiff that HRT would be eliminated.  Id. at 3.   \nThe Plaintiff ultimately argues that these instances are sufficient evidence that the \nPlaintiff was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria.  [R. 44 at 4.]  But this puts the second step \n10 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 11 of 21 - Page ID#:\n811\nbefore the first.  While all of these instances provide insight into the Plaintiffโs course of care, \nwhich could be relevant to the adequacy of care received, it does little to establish the underlying \ndiagnosis.  This is not to diminish the credibility of the treating providers, but the type of proof at \nissue requires more than a passing reference to the diagnosisโit requires substantive evidence of \nits initial determination or redetermination.  Put another way the Plaintiff is resting on inference, \nrather than proof.  Thus, apart from there being no binding case law finding Gender Dysphoria to \nbe a serious medical need, the Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient proof of a formal \ndiagnosis with Gender Dysphoria, such that there cannot be a serious medical need.        \nb \nEven if successful on the objective prong, a plaintiff must also show that the defendants \nacted with deliberate indifference.  The first question this Court raises is who is being evaluated \nunder the deliberate indifference standard? Is it the Department of Corrections? The Legislature? \nAppalachian Regional Health?  When asked at the Preliminary Injunction hearing, the Plaintiff \nasserted the Department of Corrections should be who is evaluated under the deliberate \nindifference standardโand case law supports this contention.   \nIn Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 555 (7th Cir. 2011), the Plaintiff was similarly \nchallenging a state statute banning HRT, inter alia, and the Seventh Circuit applied the deliberate \nindifference standard to the prison doctors noting that they โknew of the serious medical need \nbut refused to provide hormone therapy because of Act 105.โ  Fields, 653 F.3d at 555.   \nFields is distinguishable for two primary reasons.  First, the Fields opinion was premised \non the fact that the โDefendants did not produce any evidence that another treatment could be an \nadequate replacement for hormone therapy.โ  Fields, 653 F.3d at 556.  Here, both parties \nacknowledge that Gender Dysphoria requires treatment and that there are other treatments \n11 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 12 of 21 - Page ID#:\n812\navailable to treat Gender Dysphoria.  According to Marcumโs medical records, albeit limited at \nthis point, Marcum has received mental health services aimed at alleviating the distress \nassociated with Gender Dysphoria.  [R. 27-4 at 2 (noting the Plaintiff โis doing cognitive \nbehavioral therapy and counselingโ); R. 43 at 2 (โactive in supportive psychotherapyโ).]  Further, \nat the Preliminary Injunction Hearing, the DOC noted that they allow social transitioning, which \neven the Plaintiffโs expert noted as being highly beneficial for treating Gender Dysphoria.  [R. 4-\n1 at 7 (โDecades of scientific research and clinical experience have demonstrated that social \ntransition and gender-affirming medical care can significantly relieve the distress of gender \ndysphoria.โ).]  Second, the postures of the cases are different.  Fields proceeded through trial, \nallowing the district court to compile a full factual record, including expert testimony and cross-\nexamination. Fields, 653 F.3d at 553.  In this case, the Court is asked to make a decision in a \ncomplex matter on a very limited record.  \nAlthough Fields is distinguishable and non-binding, it is instructive on how Courts \nshould apply the deliberate indifference standard when a statute is allegedly violative of the \nEighth Amendment.  Thus, the Court applies the deliberate indifference standard to the DOC, \nand by extension ARH medical providers.3    \nWith respect to DOC, the Plaintiff has provided no Declarations of prison medical \npersonnel, or any other evidence against DOC showing deliberate indifference.  The Plaintiff \nargues that the following demonstrates that DOC had a subjective awareness and conscious \ndisregard of the Plaintiffโs serious medical need: \n \n3 The Court is aware there is a pending Motion to Dismiss [R. 37] filed by ARH.  However, the Court finds that the \ndeliberate indifference standard applied to either DOC or ARH is the same resultโthere is no evidence at this \njuncture that either entity was deliberately indifferent towards the Plaintiff.  A prerequisite of Monell liability is \ndetermining whether there was a constitutional violation in the first place.  Because Plaintiff is only seeking to \nenjoin enforcement of Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280, the Court only reaches this preliminary issue of constitutionality \nand declines to address Monell liability at this juncture. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 13 of 21 - Page ID#:\n813\n(a) DOC previously withheld HRT care from Plaintiff in 2015, but it reversed \ncourse the following year after its Health Care Administration Review Team \nreviewed Plaintiffโs case and agreed that her HRT treatment should be resumed \n[Compl., at ยถ 38-40]; (b) since 2016, Plaintiff received HRT care under the \nsupervision of DOC-provided healthcare providers while in DOCโs custody. \n \n[R. 4 at 13.]  At the Preliminary Injunction hearing, the Plaintiff analogized HRT to \ninsulinโsaying that for some patients with diabetes exercise and diet is all that is \nnecessary, but for others insulin is required.  So, it follows that for some individuals with \nGender Dysphoria therapy and social transitioning are enough, but for others HRT is \nrequired.  The problem in making this analogy is that the Plaintiff is assuming that HRT \nis a well-settled area of medicine.  When, in fact, the record indicates that there remains \nsignificant disagreement about whether the side effects and the negative consequences of \nHRT outweigh the positive benefits.  And, further, there is medical evidence suggesting \nthat even if HRT is not provided, there are other ways to care for an individual diagnosed \nwith Gender Dysphoria, absent using HRT.  [R. 20-1 at 12 (โICD-11s gender \nincongruence definition also states that โother healthcare servicesโ besides hormonal and \nsurgical treatment could be used to make the personโs body align with gender which \nwould not rule out psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy alone as potential \nremedies for this condition.โ)].  Thus, there is no evidence that the DOC implementing \nthe HRT ban would constitute deliberate indifference.  \nApplying the deliberate indifference standard to the ARH physicians, the Court does not \nfind them to have acted with deliberate indifference in light of the expert medical opinions.  A \ndoctor's errors in medical judgment or other negligent behavior do not suffice to establish \ndeliberate indifference.  See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 107โ08.  Instead, the plaintiff must show that the \ndefendants acted with a mental state โequivalent to criminal recklessness.โ  Santiago, 734 F.3d at \n13 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 14 of 21 - Page ID#:\n814\n591 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 839โ40).  This showing requires proof that each defendant \nโsubjectively perceived facts from which to infer substantial risk to the prisoner, that he did in \nfact draw the inference, and that he then disregarded that riskโ by failing to take reasonable \nmeasures to abate it. Comstock, 273 F.3d at 703 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).  There is no \ndeliberate indifference โif a genuine debate exists within the medical community about the \nnecessity or efficacyโ of a given treatment.  Gibson v. Collier, 920 F.3d 212, 220 (5th Cir. 2019).   \n Both sides have presented their own medical experts who opine on their recommended \ncourse of treatment for Gender Dysphoria.  The Plaintiff has included an opinion from Dr. Dan \nH. Karasic, who is a Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University of California.  [R. 4-1 at \n3.]  The Commonwealth has included an opinion from Dr. Michael Laidlaw, who is a board-\ncertified endocrinologist.  [R. 20-1 at 3.]  The Court first addresses Dr. Karasicโs opinion.   \nDr. Karasic relies heavily on the research done by the World Professional Association for \nTransgender Health (WPATH), where he worked as a contributing author of the WPATH \nStandards of Care, Versions 7 and 8.  [R. 4-1 at 7.]  In his opinion, Dr. Karasic grounds his \nconclusion in the Standards of Care for the Health of Transexual, Transgender, and Gender \nNonconforming People (WPATH SOC 8).  [R. 4-1 at 12.]  Dr. Karasic ultimately concludes \nKy. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280 โis contrary to widely accepted evidence-based medical protocols for \nthe treatment of gender dysphoria and puts these individuals at risk of significant harm, including \nheightened risk of depression, self-harm, and suicidality.โ  [R. 4-1 at 20.] \nAt this juncture, the court finds that Dr. Karasicโs expert opinion is credible. Dr. Karasic \nprovided an initial report, totaling 21 pages.  Dr. Karasic provides sufficiently detailed \nobservations, assessments, and recommendations based on his clinical experience and peer-\nreviewed research.  Dr. Karasicโs qualifications and resume show decades of experience with \n14 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 15 of 21 - Page ID#:\n815\nGender Dysphoria.  [R. 4-1 at 22.]  However, while the Court finds Dr. Karasicโs opinion \ncredible, the Court has doubts as to the relevance of some of his conclusions as it pertains to this \ncase.       \nDr. Karasic does not provide reference to the Plaintiff or the Plaintiffโs medical records, \nnor does he discuss the tapering mechanism provided in the statute.  If this process is as \nmedically individualized as the Plaintiff acknowledges [R. 34 at 5 (noting that HRT prescription \nand administration โis (or should be) an individualized medical decisionโ), Dr. Karasicโs opinion \nis not very helpful in parsing through the Plaintiffโs individual medical needs as it relates to \nGender Dysphoria.  Further, Dr. Karasic also notes that he โis aware of no basis in medicine or \nscience for categorically prohibiting gender-affirming medical care.โ  [R. 4.1 at 18.]  However, \nthe Public Funds Ban is not a categorical ban on HRT.  It is a ban on using public money to fund \nHRT treatment.  The Plaintiff, if so inclined, could still receive HRT paying out of pocket, absent \nan internal DOC policy saying otherwise.4  \nDr. Laidlaw, the Commonwealthโs medical expert, called into question WPATH, the \nresearch method underlying the majority of Dr. Karasicโs opinion.  Dr. Laidlaw concludes \nโ[t]here exists insufficient evidence of [the] benefit of GAT, but serious concerns for risk of \nharm. Persons affected by the law can still be treated by standard medical and psychological \ninterventions. Therefore, I believe that Kentuckyโs Revised Statute ยง 197.280(2) and (3) is based \non sound medical principles for the protection of human persons.โ  [R. 20-1 at 39.]  The Court \nfinds Dr. Laidlawโs opinion to also be credible at this juncture.  He has extensive experience \nresearching gender dysphoria and his opinion discusses in depth the potential side effects \n \n4 When asked whether an inmate could pay for Gender Dysphoria treatment out of pocket at the Preliminary \nInjunction hearing, the DOC said that they thought this could be an option, but there is no set policy as this is a \ndeveloping area of law.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 16 of 21 - Page ID#:\n816\nsurrounding cross-sex hormones, as well as the problems he sees with relying on WPATH and \nthe Endocrine Society in forming medical opinions.  [R. 20-1 at 25 (โWPATH has functioned \nprimarily as an advocacy organization for promoting social and political activism rather than as a \nstrictly scientific organization.โ); R. 20-1 at 27-28 (โIt is notable that the Endocrine Society \nnever claimed that its guideline should be considered a standard of care.  In fact, quite the \nopposite.  The Endocrine Society states that its โguidelines cannot guarantee any specific \noutcome, nor do they establish a standard of care.โโ). Unlike Dr. Karasic, Dr. Laidlaw made fact-\nspecific inquiries into the Plaintiffโs medical records.  [R. 41-2.]  And, at the very least, the Court \nfinds that Dr. Laidlawโs opinion reasonably calls into question the research methodology \nunderlying Dr. Karasicโs opinion.  \nCases involving dueling medical experts will typically not support an Eighth Amendment \nclaim.  In fact, credible dueling experts seem to be strong proof that there is not a medical \nconsensus as to the standard of care required to treat Gender Dysphoria.  See Gibson, 920 F.3d at \n220 (โThere is no intentional or wanton deprivation of care if a genuine debate exists within the \nmedical community about the necessity or efficacy of that care.โ).   \nAt the Preliminary Injunction hearing, the Plaintiff rested on the fact that there is only \none dissenting medical opinion (Dr. Laidlaw) and three medical opinions (Dr. Karasic, APRN \nFerguson, and Dr. Uy) who are in favor of continuing HRT treatment.  The Court finds three \nproblems with this conclusion.  First, there is no evidence that either APRN Ferguson or Dr. Uy \nspecialize in researching Gender Dysphoria as neither of their CVโs are in the record and there \nremains questions about the level of their involvement in the Plaintiffโs care since their opinions \nsimply operate as a recommendation for DOC providers, who are actually treating the Plaintiff.  \n[R. 27 at 2.]  Second, while a single dissenting expert does not โautomatically defeat[] medical \n16 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 17 of 21 - Page ID#:\n817\nconsensus about whether a particular treatment is necessary in the abstract,โ it does demonstrate \nat this early stage that there is a โrobust and substantial good faith disagreement dividing \nrespected members of the expert medical community.โ Gibson, 920 F.3d at 220. Last, neither Dr. \nUy nor APRN Ferguson ever definitively stated that they would not be able to adequately care \nfor the Plaintiff absent HRT.   \nThus, the Plaintiff has failed to show that the treatment received amounts to a conscious \ndisregard of the risk the Plaintiff faces.  When โa doctor orders treatment consistent with the \nsymptoms presented and then continues to monitor the patient's condition, an inference of \ndeliberate indifference is unwarranted.โ Self v. Crum, 439 F.3d 1227, 1232โ33 (10th \nCir. 2006).  Here, the Plaintiff has provided no evidence that the doctors are treating the Plaintiff \ninconsistent with the diagnosis.  Again, just because the Plaintiff would like to receive a certain \ntype of treatment, does not mean there is a constitutional right to receive said treatment.   \n2 \nThe next factor is irreparable harm.  โThat factor is indispensable: If the plaintiff isn't \nfacing imminent and irreparable injury, there's no need to grant relief now as opposed to at the \nend of the lawsuit.โ  D.T. v. Sumner Cnty. Schools, 942 F.3d 324, 327 (6th Cir. 2019).  To \nestablish an irreparable injury, the Plaintiff must show that the injury is โโboth certain and \nimmediate,โ not โspeculative or theoretical.โโ  Id. (internal citation omitted).   The Plaintiff \nargues that cessation of treatment will cause โexacerbation of their Gender Dysphoria and the \nclinically significant distress associated with it, increased risk of depression, anxiety, self-harm \n(including attempts to self-castrate), and suicidality.โ  [R. 4 at 15.]  The Plaintiff also argues that \nif a constitutional violation is found under the first factor, the finding of irreparable injury is \nmandated.  Id. Conversely, the Defendants argue even though the Plaintiff experienced adverse \n17 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 18 of 21 - Page ID#:\n818\nside effects the first time HRT was stopped, this was over ten years ago and was an abrupt \ndiscontinuation.  [R. 20 at 10-11.]  It is not certain that the Plaintiff would experience similar \nside effects this time.  Id. \nThe Court agrees with the Defendants that the Plaintiff has not met the burden of \nshowing the alleged injury is certain and immediate.  First, the Plaintiff compares the past \nsymptoms when taken off HRT in 2014 to the likely symptoms that will be experienced if taken \noff HRT again [R. 4-2 at 5 (โThis abrupt reversal of care threatens my health and safety all over \nagain.โ)], but the record does not verify that the Plaintiff suffered any of these symptoms.  \nFurther, the circumstances in the first instance are easily distinguishable from the presentโthe \nPlaintiff was abruptly taken off HRT and newly incarcerated, which is an undoubtedly stressful \nand unique experience.  [R. 4 at 6.]  Thus, the Court does not find relying on the Plaintiffโs prior \nside effects compelling enough to create an inference that the injury in this case is โcertainโ and \nโimmediate.โ   \nSecond, there is no indication one way or the other of the effect that tapering HRT will \nhave on the Plaintiffโs symptoms.  Last, even if the Plaintiff experiences similar symptoms, there \nis no indication in the expert opinions or record that these side effects rise to the level of \nirreparable.  Courts issue preliminary injunctions so โthat an injury may not be done, which it \nmay be out of our power to repair.โ  EOG Resources, Inc. v. Lucky Land Management, LLC, 134 \nF.4th 868, 883 (6th Cir. 2025) (internal citation omitted).  There is no evidence that the alleged \ninjury could not be undone after this case reaches its natural conclusion.  In fact, the record \nindicates that the Plaintiff was taken off HRT for two years, put back on HRT, and the medical \nrecords indicates Marcum is stable [R. 27-4 at 2 (noting at the most recent telehealth visit the \nPlaintiff โis happy with her changes,โ โhas good support from her friends,โ and โfeels safeโ)], \n18 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 19 of 21 - Page ID#:\n819\nwhich supports the notion that if taken off HRT again while this case proceeded through the \nsystem, any of the side effects the Plaintiff would suffer could be undone.  \n3 \nBecause both parties combine their arguments relating to harm to others and the public \ninterest, the Court will address both jointly.  The Plaintiff argues that the cessation of treatment \nwould cause substantial suffering.  [R. 4 at 16.]  The Plaintiff also states that โneither the official \ncapacity Defendants nor corporate Defendant will suffer any harm from abiding by their \nconstitutional duty to provide medically necessary health care for Gender Dysphoria to Plaintiffs \nand the proposed class, as they were doing prior to the enactment of Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280.โ  \n[R. 4 at 17.]  Last, the Plaintiff argues that โthe public interest also weighs in favor of Plaintiff \nbecause the public has an interest in ensuring the continued dignity of incarcerated individuals.โ  \nId.  \nThe Defendants argue โthe General Assemblyโthe peopleโs representativesโclearly \nbelieved that these statutory provisions were in the public interest because they serve both the \nfinancial interest and the health interest of the peopleโ and absent a constitutional violation these \ntypes of decisions are well within the General Assemblyโs authority.  [R. 20 at 12.]  The Court \nagrees.  While the Court is sympathetic to the Plaintiffโs argument that there may be side effects \nbecause of HRT being tapered off, prisons are uniquely positioned because they implicate \nimportant issues of comity and federalism.  See Kendrick v. Bland, 740 F.2d 432, 437 (6th Cir. \n1984) (โ[J]udicial deference is accorded not merely because the administrator ordinarily will, as \na matter of fact in a particular case, have a better grasp of his domain than the reviewing judge, \nbut also because the operation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly the providence of the \n19 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 20 of 21 - Page ID#:\n820\nLegislative and Executive Branches of our Government not the Judicial.โ) (internal citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, the PLRA imposes certain hurdles on prisoners seeking to challenge prison \nconditions.  If the Court grants injunctive relief, the relief must be โnarrowly drawn,โ โextend[] \nno further than necessary,โ and โis the least intrusive means necessary.โ  18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(2).  \nSection 3626(a)(2) also provides that preliminary injunctive relief shall expire 90 days after its \nentry, unless the court makes additional findings.  The aim of both of these requirements seem to \nbe to prevent judicially managed interventions in prison operations.  The very existence of the \nPLRA provides further proof of the publicโs strong interest in curtailing judicial overreach and \nensuring respect for prison management.  Accordingly, the record is simply not developed \nenough to conclude that the harm to the Plaintiff will be severe enough to outweigh the important \npublic interest in preserving comity and federalism.  \nIII \nWhile a Preliminary Injunction does not require a fully developed record, it does \nrequire a clear showing of entitlement to relief before the Court can take the \nextraordinary step of enjoining a duly enacted state statute.  The Plaintiff asks the Court \nfor a preliminary injunction preventing the enforcement of Ky. Rev. Stat. ยง 197.280. So \nfar the Plaintiff has failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of the claims due \nto an underdeveloped record.  Hence, the request for a Preliminary Injunction must be \ndenied.  But, to be clear this is a preliminary decision not one that is final.  A final \ndecision in this matter will have the benefit of a fully developed factual record.   \nThe Plaintiff has also filed a Motion for Class Certification [R. 3] and Defendant \nARH has filed a Motion to Dismiss [R. 37].  Because no injunctive relief has been \n20 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 59     Filed: 09/12/25     Page: 21 of 21 - Page ID#:\n821\ngranted, the Court does not address these Motions here.  These Motions, however, remain \npending before the Court and will be addressed in subsequent opinions.   \n  Accordingly, and the Court being otherwise sufficiently, it is hereby ORDERED \nthat the Plaintiffโs Motion for Preliminary Injunction [R. 4] is DENIED.  \n \nThis the 12th day September 2025.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n ",

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Plaintiff Maddilyn Marcum1 (โPlaintiffโ), by counsel, brings this 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \naction on behalf of herself and all current and future similarly-situated individuals in the custody \nof the Kentucky Department of Corrections (โDOCโ) to challenge the ban on public funds being \nused to provide Hormone Replacement Therapy (โHRTโ), as codified at Kentucky Revised Statute \n(โKRSโ) ยง 197.280(2) and (3). Specifically, Plaintiff is a transgender woman who, while in the \ncustody of the DOC, has received HRT for several years under the care of licensed medical \n \n1   Plaintiff is a transgender woman and this Complaint is  filed under her legal name, \nMaddilyn Marcum. See In Re: Change of Name for Matthew Paul Smith, No. 22-P-050 (Lee Dist. \nCt. Oct. 11, 2022). For identification purposes, however, Maddilyn Marcumโs name with the Ky. \nDepartment of Corrections is Matthew Paul Smith, and her Kentucky DOC # is 278317. \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 2 of 19 - Page ID#: 2\n \n \nproviders to treat her diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria. But Plaintiff will now be denied that medical \ntreatment because KRS ยง 197.280(1)(a) defines โcosmetic service or elective procedureโ as โany \nprocedure, treatment, or surgery to enhance or alter the appearance of any area of the head, neck, \nand body, including โฆ [p]rescribing or administering cross-sex hormones in amounts greater \nthan would normally be produced endogenously in a healthy person of the same age and sexโโ \n(emphasis added), and because KRS ยง 197.280(2) bans public funds from being โused, granted, \npaid, or distributed for the purpose of providing a cosmetic or elective procedure to an inmate in a \ncorrectional facilityโ irrespective of its necessity to treat a serious medical condition. Moreover, \nthe only exception to this ban is merely temporary, in that if a health care provider determines that \nimmediate cessation of HRT treatment would cause the person physical harm, then public funds \nmay nonetheless be used for continued HRT treatment but only insofar as the treatment is \nโsystematically reduced and eliminatedโ rather than immediately terminated. KRS ยง 197.280(3).2 \nPlaintiff and the class seek a declaration that the prohibition on public funds being used for \nHRT to treat Gender Dysphoria at KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) (the โPublic Funds Banโ) is \nunconstitutional, both facially and as-applied. They assert that the Public Funds Ban on HRT care \nviolates their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and they seek a temporary \nrestraining order as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief (in accordance with 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 3626) barring all Defendants from enforcing the Public Funds Ban as it relates to HRT \ncare. Plaintiff and the class also assert a claim, pursuant to Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, 436 \nU.S.  658  (1978),  against  Defendant  Appalachian  Regional  Healthcare,  Inc.  (โARHโ)  for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief challenging, on Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, a \n \n2   This action does not challenge the ban on public funds being used for gender reassignment \nsurgery also contained in KRS ยง 197.280(2). \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 3 of 19 - Page ID#: 3\n \n \ncorporate policy or practice of mandating that its providers, including the providers overseeing \nPlaintiffโs HRT care, enforce KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) by reducing, terminating, or withholding \nHRT care from patients irrespective of any patient-specific medical judgment of medical necessity \nor relevant professional medical ethics to the contrary. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331, which provides for original \ndistrict court jurisdiction over cases presenting federal questions. \n3.  Venue  is  proper  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1391(b)  because  the  Plaintiff  is \nincarcerated at Northpoint Training Center in Boyle County, Kentucky; thus, a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to the claims at issue occurred there.   \nIII.  PARTIES \nClass of Incarcerated Individuals \n4.  Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of herself and on behalf of a class of current \nand future incarcerated individuals in DOCโs custody who will be deprived of HRT care due to \nDefendantsโ enforcement of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3). The class is brought pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2), and it is defined as: โAll current and future individuals in the custody \nof the Kentucky Department of Corrections, whether housed in a state, county, or local facility, \nwho are either diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria or who meet the criteria for a Gender Dysphoria \ndiagnosis, and who have received, or would receive, gender-affirming hormone therapy treatment \nfor  their  condition  absent  such  care  being  terminated  or  withheld  by  operation  of  KRS  ยง \n197.280(2) and (3).โ \n5.  As defined, the class meets all the requirements of Rule 23(a). \n3 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 4 of 19 - Page ID#: 4\n \n \n6.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. According \nto the legislative sponsor of 2025RS SB 2 (the bill later codified at KRS ยง 197.280), there were \nsixty-seven individuals in DOCโs custody who were receiving HRT for Gender Dysphoria at the \ntime of the billโs consideration.3 Thus, because of Defendantsโ enforcement of KRS ยง 197.280(2) \nand (3), those sixty-seven individuals in DOCโs custody, which includes Plaintiff, have already \nlost, or will imminently lose access to, their pre-existing HRT treatment for Gender Dysphoria. \nMoreover, future class members who will be incarcerated in DOCโs custody will be denied HRT \ncare in the first instance even if they have been diagnosed with (or meet the criteria for) Gender \nDysphoria and such care is medically necessary because of Defendantsโ future enforcement of \nKRS ยง 197.280(2). \n7.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class. Specifically, if Defendants \nare permitted to enforce KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3), then all members of the class will be subject \nto a common harmโthe denial of medically appropriate healthcare to treat a serious medical \ncondition. All members thus seek the same relief, i.e., an injunction barring enforcement of KRS \nยง 197.280(2) and (3) insofar as those statutory provisions bar public funds from being used for \nHRT care. This lawsuit also presents common questions of law, including whether Defendantsโ \nenforcement of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3), by reducing, terminating, or withholding HRT care, \nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n8.  Plaintiffโs claims are typical of those of the class. She is a transgender individual in \nthe DOCโs custody who has been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, and who has received, and \n \n3   AUSTIN  SCHICK,  Committee  approves  bill  banning  hormone  treatment  and  gender \nreassignment, Spectrum News 1 (Feb. 14, 2025), available at https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/ \nlouisville/news/2025/02/13/inmate-gender-services-bill (last visited June 3, 2025). \n \n4 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 5 of 19 - Page ID#: 5\n \n \nwould continue to receive, gender-affirming HRT healthcare but for Defendantsโ enforcement of \nKRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3). \n9.  Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the class. She does not have conflicts with \nother members of the class, she seeks the same relief as other members of the class, and she will \nrepresent the class fairly and adequately. \n10.  The class representative is also adequately represented by counsel. Putative class \ncounsel is comprised of lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky who have \nsignificant experience litigating state and federal civil rights cases, generally, as well as experience \nprosecuting and defending federal class actions cases brought under Rule 23(b)(2), specifically. \n11.  The requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are met because Defendants have acted, or will \nact, on grounds generally applicable to the class by reducing, terminating, or withholding HRT \ntreatment pursuant to KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3), and final injunctive and declaratory relief are \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole. \nNamed Plaintiff \n12.  Plaintiff Maddilyn Marcum (Ky.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nDiagnosis and Treatment of Gender Dysphoria \n16.  โGender identityโ is a personโs internal sense of belonging to a particular gender. \n17.  A personโs gender identity usually corresponds to the sex they were designated at \nbirth based on their external genitalia. However, transgender people have a gender identity that \ndiffers from the sex designated at birth. A transgender man is someone who was designated a \nfemale at birth but whose gender identity corresponds to male. And a transgender woman is \nsomeone who was designated a male at birth but whose gender identity is female. \n18.  According to the American Psychiatric Associationโs Diagnostic & Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (โDSM-5-TRโ), โGender Dysphoriaโ is \n6 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 7 of 19 - Page ID#: 7\n \n \nthe diagnostic term for the condition experienced by some transgender people of clinically \nsignificant distress resulting from the lack of congruence between their gender identity and their \nsex designated at birth. To be diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, the incongruence must have \npersisted  for  at  least  six  months  and  be  accompanied  by  clinically  significant  distress  or \nimpairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  \n19.  Gender Dysphoria is a serious medical condition for which medical treatment is \nappropriate.  See  Phillips  v.  Michigan  Depโt  of  Corrections,  731  F.  Supp.  792,  799 \n(W.D.Mich.1990), affโd, 932 F.2d 969 (6th Cir.1991); Murray v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 106 F.3d \n401, 1997 WL 34677, at *3 (6th Cir. 1997) (unpublished). \n20.  DOC recognizes Gender Dysphoria as a serious medical need. DOC has also \nrecognized and authorized HRT care as an appropriate and necessary medical treatment for several \nyears to treat certain individuals in its custody who have been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, \nincluding Plaintiff. \n21.  Defendant ARH recognizes Gender Dysphoria as a serious medical need. ARH, \nthrough its licensed medical providers, has recognized and prescribed HRT care as an appropriate \nand necessary medical treatment to treat certain individuals in DOCโs custody who have been \ndiagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, including Plaintiff. \n22.  If left untreated, Gender Dysphoria causes serious physical and psychological \nharm. Symptoms of untreated Gender Dysphoria can include, but are not limited to: anxiety, \ndepression, eating disorders, socially-isolating behavior, self-harm, and suicidality. \n23.  The standard of care in treating Gender Dysphoria aims to resolve the distress \nassociated with the incongruence between a transgender personโs designated sex at birth and their \ngender identity by enabling the individual to live consistently with their gender identity. This can \n7 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 8 of 19 - Page ID#: 8\n \n \ninvolve social transition (such as dressing, styling oneโs hair, and using a name and pronouns that \nmatch oneโs gender identity); HRT care to masculinize or feminize the body; and various surgeries \nto change primary and/or secondary sex characteristics. \n24.  Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of Gender Dysphoria have been \npublished by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the \nEndocrine  Society.  WPATH  is  a  professional  organization  of  medical  and  mental  health \nprofessionals focused on transgender health care and has been issuing these guidelines since 1979. \nThe current version, the Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse \nPeople, Version 8 (WPATH SOC 8) was published in 2022.4 The Endocrine Society, which is a \nprofessional association of endocrinologists, first issued guidelines for the treatment of gender \ndysphoria in 2011 and updated the guidelines in 2017.5 \n25.  These  guidelines  are  supported  by  the  leading  medical  and  mental  health \nassociations in the United States, including but not limited to the American Medical Association, \nthe American Psychiatric Association, and the American Psychological Association. Further, these \nguidelines recognize HRT as an appropriate treatment for certain individuals diagnosed with \nGender Dysphoria.  \n26.  Withdrawing gender-affirming health care from or denying such care to individuals \nfor whom it is medically indicated puts them at risk of significant harm to their health. \n \n4   ELI COLEMAN, et al., Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse \nPeople, Version 8, 23 Int. J. of Transgender Health S1 (2022), available at https://wpath.org/ \npublications/soc8/ (last visited June 3, 2025). \n \n5   See  WYLIE  C.  HEMBREE,  et  al.,  Endocrine  Treatment  of  Gender  Dysphoric/Gender \nIncongruent  Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, 102 J. of Clinical \nEndocrinology  &  Metabolism  3869  (2017),  available  at  https://www.endocrine.org/clinical-\npractice-guidelines/gender-dysphoria-gender-incongruence (last visited June 3, 2025). \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 9 of 19 - Page ID#: 9\n \n \n27.  For those for whom HRT care has alleviated the distress associated with a diagnosis \nof Gender Dysphoria, withdrawing such care can be expected to result in a return of the symptoms \nthey were previously experiencing as well as the associated clinically significant distress. Some of \nthe effects of HRT are reversible, so discontinuing that treatment would cause transgender men to \nlose masculinization and transgender women to lose feminization of their features, exacerbating \ntheir Gender Dysphoria. \nKRS ยง 197.280 \n28.  In the 2025 legislative session, Senate Bill 2 (โSB 2โ), entitled โAn Act relating to \ncorrectional  facilities,โ  was  introduced  and  eventually  passed.  It  became  law  without  the \nGovernorโs signature on March 27, 2025. \n29.  Because SB 2 did not contain an emergency clause, it became effective on Friday, \nJune 27, 2025 pursuant to KY. CONST. ยง 55, as confirmed by Kentuckyโs Attorney General. See \nOAG 25-05 (Apr. 1, 2025). \n30.  SB 2 is codified at KRS ยง 197.280. And under KRS ยง 197.280(1)(a), โcosmetic \nservice or elective procedureโ is defined as โany procedure, treatment, or surgery to enhance or \nalter the appearance of any area of the head, neck, and body, including โฆ [p]rescribing or \nadministering  cross-sex  hormones  in  amounts  greater  than  would  normally  be  produced \nendogenously in a healthy person of the same age and sex.โ This definition of โcosmetic service \nor elective procedureโ thus includes HRT treatment for Gender Dysphoria. \n31.  KRS ยง 197.280(2) provides that โpublic funds shall not be directly or indirectly \nused, granted, paid, or distributed for the purpose of providing a cosmetic or elective procedure to \nan inmate in a correctional facility.โ And the statute broadly defines โpublic fundsโ to include โany \n9 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 10 of 19 - Page ID#:\n10\n \n \nmoney, regardless of the original source of the money,โ of any state or local governmental entity \nor subdivision thereof. KRS ยง 197.280(1)(b)(1)-(3). \n32.  KRS  ยง  197.280(3)  provides  a temporary  exception  to  the Public  Funds  Ban \ncontained in subsection 2, but only insofar as it permits the expenditure of public funds for HRT \ncare if a health care provider determines that immediate termination of such treatment would cause \nthe incarcerated patient physical harm. Even in that scenario, however, the use of public funds for \nsuch treatment is limited to that which is necessary while the treatment is โsystematically reduced \nand eliminated.โ \n33.  The failure to provide care for a serious medical need in the correctional setting \ncan, by itself, satisfy the objective element for Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claims. \nSee Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 737 (6th Cir. 2018) (โFor example, because a serious medical \ncondition carries with it a serious medical need, when prison officials fail to provide treatment for \nan  inmateโs  serious  medical  condition,  the  inmate  has  endured  an  objectively  serious \ndeprivation.โ). \n34.  Defendants are aware of the substantial risk of harm to Plaintiff and the Class that \nwill result from withholding HRT for the serious medical condition of Gender Dysphoria. And \nDefendantsโ enforcement of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) reflects a conscious disregard of that \nsubstantial risk of harm to Plaintiff and the Class. \nImpact of KRS ยง 197.280 \n35.  A healthcare provider first diagnosed Plaintiff with Gender Dysphoria in 2009 after \nyears of Plaintiff having struggled with severe depression, suicidal ideation, and a deep sense of \ndisconnect between her internal identity and the sex assigned at birth. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 11 of 19 - Page ID#:\n11\n \n \n36.  After being diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, Plaintiff commenced Hormone \nReplacement Therapy (โHRTโ) under the care of a mental health provider to treat her Gender \nDysphoria. Plaintiffโs regimen of HRT care for Gender Dysphoria continued for approximately \nfive years prior to the events that led to Plaintiffโs incarceration. \n37.  HRT is a recognized and medically accepted treatment for Gender Dysphoria that \nincludes administration of estrogen and anti-androgens to feminize the body in accordance with \noneโs gender identity. \n38.  Although Plaintiffโs HRT treatment was interrupted during her pretrial detention \nand the first year of her being in DOCโs custody, DOC eventually acknowledged that Plaintiffโs \nGender Dysphoria diagnosis constituted a medical condition for which the administration of HRT \nwas medically appropriate. Thus, medical providers provided by DOC prescribed HRT to treat \nPlaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria, and DOC allowed Plaintiff to resume that treatment in 2016. \n39.  Since 2016, Plaintiffโs HRT treatment regimen went undisturbed until Kentucky \nenacted 2025RS SB 2 (codified at KRS ยง 197.280). That statuteโs provisions became operative on \nJune 27, 2025. \n40.  Plaintiffโs HRT treatment for Gender Dysphoria has been prescribed and overseen \nby various providers since 2016 while in DOCโs custody. Leading up to the passage of KRS ยง \n197.280, two employees of Defendant ARHโDr. Edilfavia Mae Suaybaguio Uy and Bonnie \nFerguson,  APRNโwere  overseeing  and  prescribing  Plaintiffโs  HRT  treatment  for  Gender \nDysphoria. \n41.  On May 28, 2025, Bonnie Ferguson, APRN notified Plaintiff that because of the \nenactment of KRS ยง 197.280, Plaintiffโs HRT treatment regime will be reduced by half starting in \nAugust, 2025, and that it will be completely eliminated in November, 2025. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 12 of 19 - Page ID#:\n12\n \n \n42.  Upon information and belief, Defendant ARH adopted a corporate policy, practice, \nor custom mandating that its providers (including  APRN Ferguson and Dr. Uy) must comply with \nKRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) by reducing and eliminating HRT care for patients in DOCโs custody \nirrespective of any previous patient-specific determination of medical necessity, exercise of \nmedical judgment, or relevant professional medical ethics to the contrary. \n43.  Dr. Uy and APRN Ferguson ordered a reduction and elimination of HRT care \n(which they previously prescribed to treat Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria) for reasons unrelated to \nany patient-specific medical judgment. \n44.  The decision to reduce and eliminate Plaintiffโs HRT care is in accordance with \nARHโs corporate policy to enforce KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) irrespective of any patient-specific \nmedical judgment of medical necessity or relevant professional medical ethics to the contrary. \n45.  Dr. Uy and APRN Fergusonโs enforcement of ARHโs corporate policy to enforce \nKRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) will thus imminently deprive (and ultimately totally deny) Plaintiff and \nthe class of necessary treatment for a serious medical condition in violation of their rights under \nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n46.  Likewise, Defendants Crews and Burkettโs official-capacity enforcement of KRS ยง \n197.280(2) and (3) will imminently deprive (and ultimately totally deny) Plaintiff and the Class of \nmedically necessary treatment for a serious medical condition in violation of their rights under the \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n47.  At all relevant times, Defendant ARH, through its employees, agents, and officers, \nacted under color of state law in adopting and enforcing its corporate policy or custom mandating \nthat its providers enforce KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) irrespective of any patient-specific medical \njudgment of medical necessity or professional medical ethics to the contrary. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 13 of 19 - Page ID#:\n13\n \n \n48.  At all relevant times, Defendants Burkett and Crews, in their official capacities, \nacted under color of state law. \n49.  All Defendants have acted, and continue to act, with deliberate indifference to \nPlaintiffโs and the Classโs serious medical needs, and to the substantial risk of serious physical and \npsychological harm to Plaintiff and the Class that will result from terminating or withholding HRT \ncare for those for whom it is medically indicated. \n50.  Absent injunctive relief barring enforcement of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3), Plaintiff \nand the Class will suffer imminent and ongoing irreparable harm by being denied adequate medical \ntreatment for Gender Dysphoria, a serious medical condition, for which there is no other adequate \nremedy at law. \n51.  Prior to filing suit, Plaintiff exhausted available administrative remedies with \nrespect to the claims asserted against the Defendants in this action. \nV.

Plaintiff incorporates the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nherein. \n53.  Plaintiff has been diagnosed with an objectively serious medical condition, Gender \nDysphoria. \n54.  Without appropriate treatment, Plaintiffโs diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria will \nresult in serious and irreparable physical and psychological harm to Plaintiff. \n55.  Plaintiff has been prescribed, and has continuously received, HRT to treat her \nGender Dysphoria since 2016 while in DOCโs custody. That medical treatment has been necessary \n13 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 14 of 19 - Page ID#:\n14\n \n \nand appropriate to relieve symptoms attendant to Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria diagnosis and to \nprevent Plaintiff from suffering from severe physical and psychological harms. \n56.  Defendants Crews and Burkett, in their official capacities, are aware that Plaintiff \nand members of the putative Class have been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria, and that Plaintiff \nand members of the putative Class have been receiving HRT to treat their Gender Dysphoria while \nin DOCโs custody. \n57.  Defendants Crews and Burkett, in their official capacities, are responsible for, inter \nalia, ensuring that Plaintiff and the Class receive adequate and necessary medical treatment for \nserious medical needs, including treatment for Gender Dysphoria. \n58.  KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) erect a blanket prohibition upon the direct or indirect use \nof public funds to provide HRT care to treat Gender Dysphoria, with the sole exception being to \ntemporarily provide HRT care as it is systematically reduced and eliminated for those patients for \nwhom immediate cessation would cause physical harm. \n59.  The challenged statutory ban on providing HRT to Plaintiff for the treatment of \nGender Dysphoria is, on its face, a total denial of care for a serious medical need known to \nDefendants Crews and  Burkett, and their official capacity enforcement of it is deliberately \nindifferent to the serious medical needs of Plaintiff in violation of Plaintiffโs Eighth Amendment \nrights. \n60.  Defendants  Crews  and  Burkettโs  official  capacity  enforcement  of  KRS  ยง \n197.280(2) and (3), as applied to Plaintiff, will deprive Plaintiff of medically necessary care for an \nobjectively serious medical need in violation of her Eighth Amendment rights. \n61.

Defendants  have  acted,  and  continue  to  act,  with  deliberate  indifference  to \nPlaintiffโs serious medical needs, and to the substantial risk of serious physical and psychological \nharm to Plaintiff by enforcing KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3). \nCOUNT III and IV (CLASS CLAIMS) \nEighth AmendmentโDenial of Adequate Medical Care (facial and as-applied) \n(Against Defendants Crews and Burkett in their official capacities) \n \n63.  Plaintiff incorporates the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nherein. \n64.  The statutory ban on public funds being used, directly or indirectly, for HRT care \nconstitutes a present and ongoing denial of adequate medical treatment for a serious medical need \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment rights of the Plaintiff and the Class that subjects them to \nserious, immediate, and ongoing physical and psychological harm warranting the issuance of \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. \n65.  Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law to redress the wrongs \nalleged herein, which are of a continuing nature and will continue to cause them irreparable harm. \n66.  The challenged statutory ban on providing HRT to Plaintiff and the Class for the \ntreatment of Gender Dysphoria is, on its face, a total denial of care for a serious medical need \nknown  to  Defendants  Crews  and  Burkett,  and  their  official  capacity  enforcement  of  it  is \ndeliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of Plaintiff and the Class in violation of their \nEighth Amendment rights. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 16 of 19 - Page ID#:\n16\n \n \n67.  The Class members have been diagnosed with (or meet the clinical criteria for a \ndiagnosis of) Gender Dysphoria that will, without necessary and appropriate treatment, result in \nserious and irreparable physical and psychological harm to the Class. \n68.  Defendants are therefore aware that current Class members have been diagnosed \nwith Gender Dysphoria, and that they have been receiving HRT while in DOCโs custody. \n69.  Defendants Crews and Burkett, in their official capacities, are responsible for, inter \nalia, providing adequate and necessary medical treatment to Plaintiff and the Class, including \ntreatment for those who have been (or who meet the criteria for) Gender Dysphoria. \n70.  On its face, the blanket prohibition on the use of public funds to provide HRT care \nunder KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) deprives Plaintiff and the Class of medically necessary care for a \nserious medical need in violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. \n71.  Further, Defendants Crews and Burkettโs official capacity enforcement of KRS ยง \n197.280(2) and (3), as applied, will deprive current and future members of the Class of medically \nnecessary care for an objectively serious medical need in violation of their Eighth Amendment \nrights. \n72.  Defendants Crews and Burkettโs actions of enforcing KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) by \nreducing and depriving the Class of necessary HRT medical treatment for an objectively serious \nmedical need has caused, and will continue to cause, current and future members of the Class \nsevere physical and psychological harm. \n73.

Plaintiff incorporates the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nherein. \n75.  Plaintiff has been prescribed, and has continuously received, HRT to treat her \nGender Dysphoria since 2016 while in DOCโs custody. That medical treatment has been necessary \nto relieve symptoms attendant to Plaintiffโs Gender Dysphoria diagnosis. Current members of the \nproposed Class have also been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and prescribed HRT to treat their \ncondition. \n76.  Upon information and belief, Defendant ARH has a contract or agreement to \nprovide  individuals  in  DOCโs  custody,  including  Plaintiff,  with  adequate  and  necessary \nendocrinology-related medical treatment, including treatment for those who have been diagnosed \nwith (or who meet the criteria for) Gender Dysphoria. \n77.  Defendant ARH is a third-party corporate entity that provides medical care through \nits employees to individuals in DOCโs custody under color of state law. At all relevant times, \ntherefore, Defendant ARH acted under color of state law. \n78.  KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) erect a ban on the direct or indirect use of public funds \nto provide HRT care, including HRT care that is medically necessary for Plaintiff and the Class, \nwith the sole temporary exception being for that period of time necessary to reduce and eliminate \nsuch care for whom immediate cessation would cause physical harm. \n79.  On its face, the ban on public funds being used to provide HRT care for Gender \nDysphoria in KRS ยง 197.28(2) and (3) deprives Plaintiff and the proposed Class of adequate \n17 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 1     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 18 of 19 - Page ID#:\n18\n \n \nmedical care for a serious medical need in violation of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment \nrights. \n80.  Upon information and belief, Defendant ARH went further than KRS ยง 197.280(2) \nand (3) by adopting a corporate policy, practice, or custom of mandating that its medical provider \nemployees enforce KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) by reducing and terminating patientsโ preexisting \nHRT care for non-medical reasons, and by withholding HRT care from future patients for non-\nmedical reasons even if it would be necessary and adequate to treat a serious medical condition, \nnotwithstanding  any  patient-specific  medical  judgment  or  applicable  professional  medical \nstandards of care to the contrary. \n81.  Defendant  ARH  may  not  lawfully  direct  its  Kentucky-licensed  healthcare \nemployees  to  disregard  applicable  professional  medical  standards  or  standards  of  care  in \nterminating and withholding medically necessary treatment for objectively serious medical needs. \n82.  ARHโs corporate policy, practice, or custom deprives Plaintiff and the Class of \nmedically necessary care for an objectively serious medical need. \n83.  ARHโs corporate policy, practice, or custom of reducing and depriving Plaintiff and \nthe Class of necessary medical treatment for an objectively serious medical need for non-medical \nreasons will imminently cause Plaintiff and the Class severe physical and psychological harm. \n84.  Defendant ARH has acted, and continues to act, with deliberate indifference to the \nserious medical needs of Plaintiff and the Class, and to the substantial risk of serious physical and \npsychological harm that will result from reducing, terminating, and withholding HRT care in \naccordance with its corporate policy, practice, or custom. \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests that this Court: \n   1.

Electronically filed \n   \nCOOKIE CREWS, in her official capacity as \nCommissioner of the Ky. Department of \nCorrections; DENISE BURKETT, in her \nofficial capacity as Director of Ky. Dept. of \nCorrectionsโ Division of Medical Services; \nand APPALACHIAN REGIONAL \nHEALTHCARE, INC., \n \n  Defendants \n   \n \nMOTION FOR CERTIFICATION OF A PLAINTIFF CLASS \nPURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2) \n \n  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) and LR 7.1(a), Plaintiff Maddilyn Marcum, by counsel, \nrespectfully moves for: (a) certification of a plaintiff class, as defined below, in the above-styled \naction; (b) appointment as class representative; and (c) appointment of undersigned counsel as \nclass counsel. In support of her motion, Plaintiff submits the following: \nINTRODUCTION \n  This  is  an  action  under  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983  challenging,  on  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment grounds, Kentuckyโs blanket prohibition on public funds being used to provide \nHormone Replacement Therapy (โHRTโ) for incarcerated individuals (the โPublic Funds Banโ)1 \n \n1   The action does not challenge Kentuckyโs statutory ban on public funds being used to \nprovide  gender  reassignment  surgery  for  incarcerated  individuals.  [Class  Action  Complaint \n(โCompl.โ), at ยถ 1 n.2.] \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 2 of 17 - Page ID#: 35\ncodified at Kentucky Revised Statute (KRS) ยง 197.280(2) and (3). Plaintiff alleges that the Public \nFunds Ban, both facially and as-applied, constitutes deliberate indifference to the serious medical \nneeds of herself and the class because it terminates previously prescribed (or refuses to provide in \nthe first instance) HRT care for patients who have an objectively serious medical conditionโ\nGender Dysphoriaโand for whom HRT care is medically necessary and appropriate. [Compl., at \nยถยถ 1, 6, 16-27, 51-73.] Further, the Public Funds Ban is carried out in disregard to the known \nexcessive risks of severe physical and psychological health risks associated with terminating or \nwithholding such care from patients, like Plaintiff and the class, for whom such care is necessary \nand appropriate.2 [Id. at ยถยถ 18, 20-22, 26-27, 44-49.]  \nIn this motion, Plaintiff seeks certification of a Plaintiff Class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a) and (b)(2) that includes: \nAll current and future individuals in the custody of the Kentucky Department of \nCorrections, whether housed in a state, county, or local facility, who are either \ndiagnosed with Gender Dysphoria or who meet the criteria for a Gender Dysphoria \ndiagnosis, and who have received, or would receive, gender-affirming hormone \ntherapy treatment for their condition absent such care being terminated or withheld \nby operation of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3). \n \n[Compl., at ยถ 4.]  \nBecause Plaintiff alleges that the Public Funds Ban for HRT deprives her and the class of \nconstitutionally adequate healthcare for a serious medical need in violation of their Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, she seeks a temporary restraining order as well as preliminary and \npermanent injunctive relief barring Defendantsโ enforcement of the Public Funds Ban as it relates \n \n2   โPublic fundsโ is broadly defined under KRS ยง 197.280(1)(b)(1)-(3) to include: โany \nmoney, regardless of the original source of the money, of: [t]he Commonwealth of Kentucky or \nany department, agency, or instrumentality thereof; [A]ny county, city, local school district, or \nspecial district, or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof; and [a]ny other political \nsubdivision of the Commonwealth or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof.โ \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 3 of 17 - Page ID#: 36\nto HRT care, as well as a declaratory judgment finding that the Public Funds Ban for HRT care is \nunconstitutional, both facially and as-applied as to her and the class. [Compl., at ยถยถ 1, 49-50, 52-\n73; id. at p. 19.]3 \nARGUMENT \nI.  CERTIFICATION OF A PLAINTIFF CLASS IS APPROPRIATE. \n  In deciding a motion for class certification, a court has โbroad discretionโ to determine \nwhether to certify the class, but it must conduct a โrigorous analysisโ to determine if the movant \nhas demonstrated that the proposed class satisfies the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and at least one \nprovision of Rule 23(b). Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. \nv. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 (2011); Stout v. J.D. Byrider, 228 F.3d 709, 716 (6th Cir. 2000). In seeking \nclass certification, the movant must do more than merely recite the elements under Rule 23; rather, \nโthere must be an adequate statement of the basic facts to indicate that each requirement of the rule \nis fulfilled.โ Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 F.3d 532, 537 (6th Cir. 2012) (cleaned up). \n  Moreover, in addition to Rule 23(a)โs explicit prerequisitesโnumerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequate representationโa party seeking class certification in this circuit (under \nRule 23(b)(1) or (b)(3)) must also demonstrate that the โthat the defined class โis sufficiently \ndefinite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether an individual is a \nmember of the proposed class.โโ Malam v. Adducci, 475 F. Supp. 3d 721, 731โ32 (E.D. Mich. \n2020), amended, 2020 WL 4818894 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 19, 2020) (quoting Young, 693 F.3d at 537-\n38). But where, as here, the movant seeks certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for claims seeking \n \n3   On behalf of herself and the class, Plaintiff also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief \nagainst  ARHโa private healthcare corporate entity that provides endocrinology services to \nKentucky state inmatesโunder a Monell theory of liability. [Compl., at ยถยถ 15, 42-45, 73-83.] And \nshe seeks recovery of attorneysโ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1988 and 1997e. [Id.] \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 4 of 17 - Page ID#: 37\ninjunctive and declaratory relief only, this โascertainabilityโ element is not required. Cole v. \nMemphis, 839 F.3d 530, 542 (6th Cir. 2016). \n  And where, as here, the plaintiff class is comprised of prisoners, the Prison Litigation \nReform Act does not alter a courtโs class certification analysis. See, e.g., Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d \n354, 369 (5th Cir. 2017) (โThe text of Section 3626(a)(1)(A) plainly says nothing at all about class \nactions or the requirements for class certification. Nor have Defendants directed us to any other \nprovision of the PLRAโor any other statute for that matterโthat would support applying Section \n3626(a)(1)(A) at the class certification stage. There is therefore no basis for engrafting Section \n3626(a)(1)(A)โs requirements onto Rule 23(b)(2)โ); Shook v. Bd. of Cnty. Commissioners of Cnty. \nof El Paso, 543 F.3d 597, 613 (10th Cir. 2008) (โOur holding in Shook I was plain: โCongress did \nnot intend the PLRA to alter class certification requirements under Rule 23.โโ) (quoting Shook v. \nEl Paso County, 386 F.3d 963 (10th Cir. 2004)). \n  In this case, all of the requisite elements for certifying a class of plaintiffs are met. \n  A.  The Class Of Potential Plaintiffs Is So Numerous That Joinder Is  \nImpracticable. \n  Rule 23(a)โs first requirement is that the putative class be โso numerous that joinder of all \nmembers  is impracticable.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). โThere is no strict numerical test for \ndetermining impracticability of joinder.โ  In re American Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th \nCir. 1996) (citing Senter v. Gen. Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 523 n.24 (6th Cir. 1976)). โThe \nnumerosity requirement requires examination of the specific facts of each case and imposes no \nabsolute limitations.โ Gen. Tel. Co. of the Northwest, Inc. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980). But \nin this circuit, โ[w]here the number of class members exceeds forty, Rule 23(a)(1) is generally \ndeemed satisfied.โ Savidge v. Pharm-Save, Inc., 727 F. Supp. 3d 661, 696 (W.D. Ky. 2024) (citation \nomitted); see also Davidson v. Henkel Corp., 302 F.R.D. 427, 436 (E.D. Mich. 2014) (noting โ[t]he \n4 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 5 of 17 - Page ID#: 38\nmodern trend for meeting the numerosity factor is to require at a minimum between 21 and 40 \nclass membersโ) (cleaned up). \n  Here, the potential class members include โ[a]ll current and future individuals in the \ncustody of the Kentucky Department of Corrections, whether housed in a state, county, or local \nfacility, who are either diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria or who meet the criteria for a Gender \nDysphoria diagnosis, and who have received, or would receive, gender-affirming hormone therapy \ntreatment for their condition absent such care being terminated or withheld by operation of KRS ยง \n197.280(2) and (3).โ [Compl., at ยถ 4.] \n  When the legislature debated the Public Funds Ban in February 2025, the billโs sponsor \nindicated that there were sixty-seven individuals in DOCโs custody who were receiving HRT to \ntreat a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria. [Compl., at ยถ 6 (citing AUSTIN SCHICK, Committee approves \nbill banning hormone treatment and gender reassignment, Spectrum News 1 (Feb. 14, 2025), \navailable  at  https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2025/02/13/inmate-gender-services-\nbill (last visited June 3, 2025)).] Every one of those sixty-seven individuals (of which Plaintiff is \none) will be adversely impacted by the Public Funds Ban because it is depriving them (or will \nimminently deprive them) of preexisting care for an objectively serious medical need. [Compl., at \nยถ 6.] And a class size of sixty-seven people is sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement. See \nDavis v. Omnicare, Inc., No. 5:18-CV-142-REW, 2021 WL 1214501, at *5 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 30, \n2021) (โ[a] class of 35 can clear the hurdleโ) (citing Young v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 693 F.3d 532, \n542 (6th Cir. 2012)); see also In re Am. Med. Sys., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th Cir. 1996); Marcus v. \nBMW of N. Am., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 595 (3d Cir.2012) (โThere is no minimum number of members \nneeded for a suit to proceed as a class action,โ but โgenerally if the named plaintiff demonstrates \n5 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 6 of 17 - Page ID#: 39\nthat the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong of Rule 23(a) has been met.โ) \n(cleaned up). \n  Moreover,  in  addition  to  these  identifiable  current  class  members,  Rule  23(a)(1)โs \nnumerosity  requirement  is  also  satisfied  given  that  the  proposed  class  encompasses  those \nindividuals who, in the future, will be: in DOCโs custody, diagnosed with (or meet the criteria for \na  diagnosis  of)  Gender  Dysphoria,  and  deprived  of  otherwise  medically-indicated  gender-\naffirming HRT care solely because of Public Funds Ban. [Compl., at ยถ 6.] These โpotential future \nclass membersโ may be considered by the court in conducting its Rule 23(a)โs numerosity analysis, \nbut only insofar as their number can be reasonably approximated. See, e.g., Bethesda Lutheran \nHomes and Services, Inc. v. Leean, 165 F.R.D. 87, 88-89  (W.D. Wis. 1996) (โWhile potential \nfuture members of a class may be considered in the numerosity analysis, this is only true to the \nextent that the Court can reasonably approximate their numberโ) (citing Valentino v. Howlett, 528 \nF.2d 975, 978-79 (7th Cir. 1976)). \nHere, the number of future class members who will be affected by the challenged Public \nFunds Ban can be reasonably approximated by looking to the statistical composition of individuals \nwith Gender Dysphoria within DOCโs inmate population. See, e.g., Charlebois v. Angels Baseball, \nLP, 2011 WL 2610122, at *9 (C.D. Cal. June 30, 2011) (unreported) (โTherefore, like the court in \nArnold noted, โ[b]y the very nature of this class, its members are unknown and cannot be readily \nidentifiedโ and the numerosity factor can be met based on statistical, speculative evidence.โ) \n(quoting Arnold v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 158 F.R.D. 439, 448 (N.D.Cal.1994)). \n  Specifically, as of February 15, 2025, there were 18,645 individuals in DOCโs custody. \nKY.  DEPT.  OF  CORRECTIONS,  Inmate  Profiles  (Feb.  15,  2025)  at \nhttps://corrections.ky.gov/publicinformation/researchandstats/Documents/Monthly%20Report/ \n6 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 7 of 17 - Page ID#: 40\n2025/Inmate%20Profile%2002-2025.pdf (last visited June 6, 2025). And as of January 8, 2025, \nsixty-seven of those people were receiving HRT to treat Gender Dysphoria, according to the \nJustice and Public Safety Cabinetโs General Counsel, Leah Boggs. JOE SONKA, Kentucky Senate \nbill  would  ban  hormone  therapy  for  transgender  inmates  (Feb.  10,  2025)  at \nhttps://www.lpm.org/news/2025-02-10/kentucky-senate-bill-would-ban-hormone-therapy-for-\ntransgender-inmates (last visited June 6, 2025). [See also Compl., at ยถ 6 n.3.] Thus, just over one-\nthird of one percent of Kentuckyโs current inmate population falls within the proposed class. That \nfrequency  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  continue  into  the  future  given  the  prevalence  of \ntransgenderism in the U.S. population, generally, and among prisoners, specifically. See, e.g., \nWILLIAMS INSTITUTE, How Many Adults and Youth Identify as Transgender in the United States? \n(June  2022)  at  https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-\nstates/#:~:text=Our%20estimates%20of%20the%20percent,%2C%20up%20from%2010%25%2\n0previously. (last visited June 6, 2025) (approximately 1.3 million adults, or 0.5% of the U.S. \npopulation, identify as transgender); KATE SOSIN, Trans, imprisoned โ and trapped (NBC News \nFeb.  26,  2020)  at  https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-women-are-nearly-\nalways-incarcerated-men-s-putting-many-n1142436 (last visited June 6, 2025) (reporting that, \nbased on data from 45 states and Washington, D.C., there were 4,890 transgender prisoners \nincarcerated in state prisons). See also United States v. Skrmetti, 605 U.S. --, 145 S. Ct. 1816, 1824 \n(2025) (โAn estimated 1.6 million Americans over the age of 13 identify as transgender, meaning \nthat their gender identity does not align with their biological sex.โ). \n   This data establishes a reasonable approximation of the number of prospective future class \nmembers  who  will  be  adversely  impacted  by  the  challenged  Public  Funds  Ban,  and  the \nconsideration of those future class members reinforces the conclusion that the numerosity element \n7 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 8 of 17 - Page ID#: 41\nis met. See Golden v. City of Columbus, 404 F.3d 950, 966 (6th Cir. 2005) (Plaintiffโs โbare \nspeculationโ regarding class numerosity is insufficient, plaintiff must offer information linking the \nputative class members to the โgravamenโ of the plaintiffโs claim for liability). Because the present \nand  future  class  membersโ  size  renders  joinder  impracticable,  Rule  23(a)(1)โs  numerosity \nrequirement is satisfied. \n  B.  There Are Common Questions Of Law And Fact. \n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) requires that the class have common โquestions of law or fact.โ  \nDespite Rule 23(a)(2)โs reference to common questions of law or fact โin the plural, there need \nonly be one question common to the class โ though that question must be a โcommon issue the \nresolution of which will advance the litigation.โโ Alkire v. Irving, 330 F.3d 802 , 820 (6th Cir. 2003) \n(quoting Sprague v. Gen. Motors Corp., 133 F.3d 388, 397 (6th Cir. 1998)); Powers v. Hamilton \nCounty Public Defender Comโn, 501 F.3d 592, 619 (6th Cir. 2007) (โThe commonality requirement \nis satisfied if there is a single factual or legal question common to the entire classโ). โA common \nnucleus of operative fact is usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule \n23(a)(2).โ  Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998). Factual variations in the claims of \nindividual class members will not preclude a finding of commonality. Patterson v. General Motors \nCorp., 631 F.2d 476, 481 (7th Cir. 1980). \n  Here, there are common questions of fact that apply to the entire class, including: (1) \nwhether Gender Dysphoria is a medical condition for which some level of care is necessary and \nappropriate;  and  (2)  whether  HRT  care  is  a  necessary  and  appropriate  treatment  for  some \nindividuals diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria. Similarly, because the Defendants have applied (or \nwill imminently apply) the Public Funds Ban on HRT care to all class members, there are common \nlegal questions such as: (1) whether Gender Dysphoria is an objectively serious medical need \n8 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 9 of 17 - Page ID#: 42\nunder the Eighth Amendment; and (2) whether Defendantsโ enforcement of the Public Funds Ban \nconstitutes deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to those diagnosed with (or who \nmeet the criteria for a diagnosis of) Gender Dysphoria. And these questions of law would be \ndispositive of most of the claims at issue, including the Class claims, and would therefore \nsignificantly  โadvanceโ  the  litigation.  See  Alkire,  330  F.3d  at  820.  Thus,  Rule  23(a)(2)โs \nโcommonalityโ requirement is satisfied. \nC.  The Claims Of The Named Plaintiff Are Typical Of Those Of The Class. \n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)โs third prerequisite is that โthe claims or defenses of the representative \nparties [be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). โTo satisfy the \ntypicality requirement, the representative plaintiffโs interests must be aligned with those of the \nclass.โ Powers, 501 F.3d at 618 (citing Sprague, 133 F.3d at 399). Moreover, โa plaintiffโs claim \nis typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the \nclaims of other class members, and if his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.โ In re \nAm. Med. Sys., 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir. 1996). \nThe commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge. Both \nserve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances \nmaintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiffโs claim \nand the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will \nbe fairly and adequately protected in their absence. Those requirements therefore \nalso tend to merge with the adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the \nlatter requirement also raises concerns about the competency of class counsel and \nconflict of interest. \n \nRutherford v. City of Cleveland, 137 F.3d 905, 909 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting General Tel. Co. of \nthe Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.3 (1982)). \n  Here, Plaintiffโs claims are typical of the class claims because they arise from Defendantsโ \nenforcement of the statutory Public Funds Ban on HRT care for Kentucky prisoners. That statute \n9 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 10 of 17 - Page ID#:\n43\naffects all class members equally, in that its enforcement will terminate preexisting (or serve to \ndeny in the first instance) HRT care for individuals in DOCโs custody who have been diagnosed \nwith (or who meet the criteria for a diagnosis of) Gender Dysphoria. The same event, practice, or \ncourse of conduct thus gives rise to Plaintiffโs claims as well as those of the class. Further, \nPlaintiffโs claims and those of the class are based on the same legal theories: (1) that the statutory \nban on HRT care constitutes an improper denial of adequate medical care for an objectively serious \nmedical condition despite the known substantial risk of harm that will result; and (2) the corporate \npolicy, practice, or custom of enforcing the Public Funds Ban notwithstanding professional \nmedical judgment or ethical standards to the contrary constitutes unlawful deliberate indifference \nto a serious medical need. Typicality under Rule 23(a)(3) is therefore met. See, e.g., Raymond v. \nNew York State Depโt of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 579 F. Supp. 3d 327, 339 (N.D.N.Y. 2022) \n(โIn any case, typicality may be assumed where the nature of the relief sought is injunctive and \ndeclaratory.โ) (cleaned up). \n  D.  The Named Plaintiff Will Fairly And Adequately Protect The Interests Of \n    The Class. \n  The final prerequisite under Rule 23(a) is that โthe representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). โClass representatives are \nadequate when it appear[s] that [they] will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through \nqualified counsel, which usually will be the case if the representatives are part of the class and \npossess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.โ Intโl Union, United \nAuto., Aerospace, & Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 615, 626 \n(6th Cir. 2007) (internal quotations and citations omitted). This requirement โserves to uncover \nconflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.โ Beattie v. \nCenturyTel, Inc., 511 F.3d 554, 562 (6th Cir. 2007). \n10 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 11 of 17 - Page ID#:\n44\n  Here,  the  named  Plaintiff,  Maddilyn  Marcum,  is  serving  a  determinate  sentence  at \nNorthpoint Training Center. [Compl., at ยถยถ 1, 12, 35-36.] Plaintiff is a trans woman first diagnosed \nwith Gender Dysphoria in 2009, and she has received HRT treatment while in DOCโs custody since \n2016. [Id. at ยถยถ 1, 35-40.] Thus, Plaintiff is not only a member of the proposed class, but she also \npossesses the same interest as all other class members in seeking to restore HRT care for those for \nwhom it is medically indicated, such as herself. [Id.] Moreover, Plaintiff has suffered (or will \nimminently suffer) the same injury as the remaining class members, i.e., being deprived of gender-\naffirming HRT care to treat Gender Dysphoria. Plaintiff thus will vigorously prosecute the claims \nat issue and does not have any conflict that would prevent her from doing so on behalf of the \nremaining class members. \nFurther,  Plaintiffโs  counsel  are  experienced  civil  rights  attorneys  whose  collective \nexperience includes both having served as class counsel and as having defended clients against \nclass claims in federal class actions cases, including one in which state prisoners brought a class \naction case asserting Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claims. See A.N.A. v. Breckinridge \nCnty. Bd. of Educ., No. CIVA 3:08CV-4-S, 2009 WL 891841, at *1 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 30, 2009); \nWoodcock v. Correct Care Solutions, 861 F.

The ACLU of Kentucky is \nthus committed to providing the necessary resources to vigorously prosecute this action because \nof the constitutional harms inflicted upon the Plaintiff and the class, as well as the significance of \nthe civil liberties issues implicated by this case. See, e.g., Cameron v. EMW Womenโs Surgical \nCenter, P.S.C., et al., 664 S.W.3d 633 (Ky. 2023); Hart v. Thomas, 422 F. Supp. 3d 1227 (E.D. Ky. \n2019); Berry v. Schmitt, 688 F.3d 290 (6th Cir. 2012); Gingerich v. Commonwealth, 382 S.W.3d \n835 (Ky. 2012). \nIn sum, all putative class members are suffering, or will imminently suffer similar harms \nas the named Plaintiff due to Defendantsโ enforcement of the Public Funds Ban on HRT care; thus, \nthey share a common interest with Plaintiff in obtaining adequate medical treatment for their \nshared condition of Gender Dysphoria. Because the named Plaintiff: (1) is a member of the \nproposed class; (2) possesses the same interests as the remaining class members; (3) has suffered, \nor will suffer the same injuries as the class members; and (4) is represented by qualified counsel, \nRule 23(a)(4) is satisfied. \nII.  CLASS CERTIFICATION UNDER FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2) IS APPROPRIATE. \n  Finally, in addition to the satisfying the class certification requirements noted above, class \ncertification is further supported because Defendants have โacted or refused to act on grounds that \napply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nThe key to the (b)(2) class is โthe indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory \nremedy warranted -- the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or \ndeclared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.โ \nNagareda, supra, at 132. In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single \ninjunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the \nclass. It does not authorize class certification when each individual class member \nwould be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the \ndefendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each class \n12 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 13 of 17 - Page ID#:\n46\nmember would be  entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages. \n \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360-61 (2011) (emphasis in original). \nIndeed, โ[t]he (b)(2) class action was invented for the purpose of facilitating civil rights \nsuits, and much of its use is in that field today.โ Anderson Living Tr. v. ConocoPhillips Co., LLC, \n2025 WL 950473, at *29 (D.N.M. Mar. 28, 2025) (citing WILLIAM B. RUBENSTEIN, Newberg on \nClass Actions ยง 4:26 (5th ed.)). โThe (b)(2) class action allows civil rights litigants to advocate on \nbehalf of all similarly situated individuals, such as a disenfranchised black voter representing a \nclass of all black voters within an unconstitutionally drawn district or a jail inmate representing \nall inmates in an overcrowding case.โ Id. (emphasis added); see also Penson v. Terminal Transp. \nCo., 634 F.2d 989, 993 (5th Cir. 1981) (Rule 23(b)(2) was โintended primarily to facilitate civil \nrights class actions, where the class representatives typically sought broad injunctive or declaratory \nrelief against discriminatory practices.โ). Additionally, unlike membership for Rule 23(b)(3) \nclasses,  the โprecise identity  of  each  class  member  need  not  be  ascertained  hereโ because \nโascertainability is not an additional requirement for certification of a (b)(2) class seeking only \ninjunctive and declaratory relief.โ Cole v. City of Memphis, 839 F.3d 530, 542 (6th Cir. 2016). \nHere,  this  prisoner  civil  rights  action  seeks  only  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief \nchallenging, on Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment grounds: (1) the stateโs statutory Public Funds \nBan on HRT careโa medically accepted (and for those in the class, a necessary) treatment for \nGender Dysphoria; and (2) a corporate policy, practice, or custom of enforcing the Public Funds \nBan on HRT care irrespective of any patient-specific medical judgment or relevant professional \nmedical ethics to the contrary. [Compl., at ยถยถ 74-84.] Defendants are all tasked with overseeing \nand providing healthcare to individuals in the custody of DOC, either by virtue of their state \nemployment or contractual obligations. [Id. at ยถยถ 13-15.] However, the challenged statute bars the \n13 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 14 of 17 - Page ID#:\n47\ndirect or indirect use of public funds to provide (or authorize in the first instance) HRT to Plaintiff \nand the other class members and is unrelated to any medical judgment. [Id. at ยถยถ 63-73.] Similarly, \nthe challenged corporate policy of Defendant ARH mandates that its employee-providers enforce \nthe Public Funds Ban by reducing and terminating preexisting HRT care from patients for non-\nmedical reasons, and by refusing or withholding HRT care for non-medical reasons from those for \nwhom it would be necessary and appropriate to treat Gender Dysphoria, notwithstanding any \npatient-specific medical judgment or applicable professional medical standards of care to the \ncontrary. [Id. at ยถยถ 74-84.] Thus, Defendants are refusing to provide HRT treatment on grounds \nthat apply generally to the class,  i.e., Defendants are terminating or withholding necessary \nhealthcare pursuant to their enforcement of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3).4 See, e.g., Lebron v. \nWilkins, 277 F.R.D. 664, 668 (M.D. Fla. 2011) (granting class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) in \ncase challenging state statute โthat is generally applicable to all members of the classโ).  \nIII.  THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT PLAINTIFFโS ATTORNEYS AS CLASS  \nCOUNSEL \nUpon certifying the class, the Court must also appoint class counsel. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(c)(1)(B). In doing so, courts consider: (1) โthe work counsel has done in identifying or \ninvestigating potential claims in the action;โ (2) โcounselโs experience in handling class actions, \nother complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action;โ (3) โcounselโs knowledge \n \n4   As is more fully explained in Plaintiffโs motion for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction, Defendantsโ enforcement of KRS ยง 197.280(2) and (3) does not shield \nthem from 8th Amendment liability under the subjective element of the deliberate indifference \nstandard. See, e.g., Johnson v. Sanders, 121 F.4th 80, 92 (10th Cir. 2024) (โWhere a defendant has \nsubjective knowledge that a course of action or inaction required by policy creates or fails to \naddress a serious risk to an inmateโs health or safety, he may not escape constitutional liability by \ndisregarding such risk in compliance with the policy. In such circumstances, the Constitution \ndemands more of state actors charged with overseeing the carceral punishment of a convicted \nprisoner.โ). \n \n14 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 15 of 17 - Page ID#:\n48\nof the applicable law;โ and (4) โthe resources that counsel will commit to representing the class.โ \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)-(B). The court may also consider โany other matter pertinent to \ncounselโs ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(g)(1)(B). \nAs noted above, Plaintiffโs attorneys possess substantial federal civil rights litigation \nexpertise. See, e.g., Miller, et al. v. Davis, et al., 576 U.S. 1091 (Aug. 31, 2015) (denying stay); \nMiller v. Caudill, 936 F.3d 442 (6th Cir. 2019), abrogated by Lackey v. Stinnie, -- U.S. --, 145 \nS.Ct. 659 (2025); Scott v. Louisville/Jefferson Cnty. Metro Govโt, No. 3:20-CV-535-BJB, 2024 \nWL 1376497 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 31, 2024); L. W. by & through Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460 \n(6th Cir.), affโd sub nom. United States v. Skrmetti, No. 23-477, 2025 WL 1698785 (U.S. June 18, \n2025); Hart v. Thomas, 422 F. Supp. 3d 1227, 1229 (E.D. Ky. 2019); Berry v. Schmitt, 688 F.3d \n290 (6th Cir. 2012); ACLU of Ky. v. McCreary Co., Ky., 607 F.3d 439 (6th Cir. 2010); McQueary \nv. Conway, 614 F.3d 591 (6th Cir. 2010); Wilson v. Rees, et al., 620 F.3d 699 (6th Cir. 2010); ACLU \nof Ky., et al. v. Grayson Co., Ky., et al., 591 F.3d 837 (6th Cir. 2009). And in addition to the class \naction  experience  previously  noted,  counsel  collectively  also  have  substantial  experience \nrepresenting transgender plaintiffs in civil rights litigation. See Doe 1 v. Thornbury, 679 F. Supp. \n3d 576 (W.D. Ky.), revโd and remanded sub nom. L. W. by & through Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 \nF.4th 460 (6th Cir. 2023), and affโd sub nom. United States v. Skrmetti, No. 23-477, 2025 WL \n1698785 (U.S. June 18, 2025). \nMoreover, Plaintiffโs attorneys are public interest attorneys employed by the ACLU of \nKentucky, a Kentucky non-profit affiliate of a national civil rights organization dedicated to the \npromotion and defense of individualsโ civil liberties. Because Plaintiffโs counsel are experienced \nfederal civil rights litigators with substantial class action litigation experience, and because the \n15 \n \n\nCase: 5:25-cv-00238-GFVT     Doc #: 3     Filed: 07/14/25     Page: 16 of 17 - Page ID#:\n49\nACLU of Kentucky is committed to devoting the resources necessary to prosecute this litigation \nand represent the class, Plaintiffโs attorneys are adequate class counsel and should be appointed as \nsuch. See, e.g., Howard v. Liquidity Servs. Inc., 322 F.R.D. 103, 141 n.23 (D.D.C. 2017) (evidence \nprovided by plaintiffs weighed in favor of appointment of class counsel); Samma v. United States \nDepโt of Def., 2020 WL 4501000, at *10 (D.D.C. Aug. 4, 2020) (same). \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff respectfully requests that her Motion for Class \nCertification be granted, that Plaintiff be appointed class representative, and that Plaintiffโs counsel \nbe appointed to represent the certified class pursuant to Fed.
