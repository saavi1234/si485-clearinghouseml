The two unions represent about 4000 employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (&ldquo;NOAA&rdquo;)--primarily employees of the National Weather Service, and about 9,000 professional employees of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;), a component of the Department of Commerce. They sued President Trump, and lead officials for the Department of Commerce, NOAA, and USPTO.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs brought suit under the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute (&ldquo;FSLMRS&rdquo;), 5 U.S.C. &sect; 7103(b), the First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s equal protection guarantee. They sought both injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging Section 2(b) of Executive Order No. 14343 is unlawful as applied to the Office of the Commissioner of Patents and subordinate units, the National Environmental, Satellite, Data, and Information Service, and the National Weather Service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They argued that those offices do not play a national security role, and therefore the national security rationale used to justify withdrawing federal recognition of the plaintiff unions was a pretense - the real reason was political retribution because the unions had criticized President Trump&rsquo;s policies. Plaintiffs cited White House &ldquo;fact sheets&rdquo; which admitted the orders targeted unions filing grievances against President Trump&rsquo;s policies to bolster their argument that the exclusions were retaliatory, not security-based. Plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief that Section 2(b) of Executive Order No. 14251 is unlawful as applied to the USPTO&rsquo;s Office of Chief Information Officer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Paul L. Friedman.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "Two federal unions sued President Trump and top government officials after the President issued executive orders that removed collective bargaining rights from certain federal employees. The unions—representing workers at the National Weather Service and the U.S. Patent Office—argued that these employees don’t have national security roles. Therefore, taking away federal recognition of their union was unjustified. The unions argued the real reason for the orders was political retaliation because they had criticized President Trump’s policies. The unions asked the court to declare these actions illegal and to prevent the orders from being enforced against their members.",

On August 28, 2025 Donald Trump issued a Labor Day proclamation \nto “honor the proud legacy of America’s workforce — and we pay tribute to the \nunbreakable spirit that keeps it strong nearly 250 years later.” In this \nproclamation he claimed that “every day, my Administration is restoring the \ndignity of labor and putting the American worker first.” But to remove any doubt \nthat this was all farce, he simultaneously issued a new Executive Order which, in \nhonor of the day, nearly completes his union busting of the civil service. Two \nCommerce Department unions whose collective bargaining rights were stripped \nby this Labor Day Executive Order bring this suit to restore the collective voice of \nthe public servants they represent.     \n \nJurisdiction, Venue and Parties \n  2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 because the action arises under federal law, including the United States \nConstitution.  \n  3.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause three of the Defendants reside here and because a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. \n  4.  The Plaintiff National Weather Service Employees Organization \n(“NWSEO”) is a national labor organization that has been certified by the Federal \nLabor Relations Authority as the collective bargaining representative of nearly 4000 \nemployees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”), U.S. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 3 of 32\nDepartment of Commerce, including approximately 3,500 employees of the National \nWeather Service (“NWS”) and 100 employees in the Office of Satellite Products and \nOperations (“OSPO”) in the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and \nInformation Service (“NESDIS”).  The NWS employees include meteorologists, \nhydrologists, other physical scientists, technicians, support and administrative \npersonnel who staff the nation’s 122 Weather Forecast Offices, 13 River Forecast \nCenters, as well as specialized forecast centers such as the National Hurricane \nCenter in Miami, the Aviation Weather Center in Kansas City, the Severe Storms \nPrediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, the Ocean Prediction Center and Weather \nPrediction Center in College Park, Maryland, and Tsunami Warning Centers in \nHonolulu, Hawaii and Palmer, Alaska. The NESDIS employees include electronics \ntechnicians and satellite controllers at a satellite ground station in Wallops Island, \nVirginia and at NOAA’s Satellite Operations Center in Suitland, Maryland.  \n  5.  The Plaintiff Patent Office Professional Association (“POPA”) is a labor \norganization that that has been certified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority \nas the collective bargaining representative of nearly 9,000 professional employees of \nthe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), U.S. Department of Commerce, \nincluding approximately 8,500 patent examiners who work in the USPTO’s Patents \nbusiness unit under the Office of the Commissioner of Patents. These patent \nexaminers generally have a degree in a STEM discipline and examine the 600,000 \nor so patent applications filed annually to determine whether a patent can be \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 4 of 32\ngranted for various new inventions, many of which are on the cutting edge of \ntomorrow’s technological breakthroughs.  \n  6.  The Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States \nand is being sued in his official capacity.  \n  7.  The Defendant Howard W. Lutnick is the Secretary of the United \nStates Department of Commerce and is being sued in his official capacity.  \n  8.  The Defendant Laura Grimm is the Acting Administrator of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”), a component of the \nU.S. Department of Commerce that includes the National Weather Service and the  \nNational Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service. She is sued in her \nofficial capacity.  \n  9.  The Defendant Coke Morgan Stewart is the Acting Director of the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office. She is sued in her official capacity. \n \nFactual Allegations \nThe statutory framework \n10.  In 1978, Congress enacted the Federal Service Labor-Management \nRelations Statute (“FSLMR Statute” or “the Statute”) to provide a comprehensive \nstatutory framework to govern collective bargaining in the federal civil service \n“designed to meet the special requirements and needs of the Government.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 7101(b). That statutory framework is based on Congress’s recognition that “the \nright of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor \norganizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them ...safeguards the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 5 of 32\npublic interest, ... contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and ... \nfacilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between employees \nand their employers involving conditions of employment.” Id. § 7101(a).  \n11.  The FSLMR Statute guarantees federal employees the basic rights “to \nform, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity,” 5 \nU.S.C. § 7102, and to “engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of \nemployment through representatives chosen by employees,” id. § 7102(2). The \nStatute establishes election procedures for determining if a majority of employees in \nan appropriate unit choose union representation, 5 U.S.C. § 7111(b), and requires \ncovered agencies to “accord exclusive recognition to a labor organization if the \norganization has been selected as the representative, in a secret ballot election, by a \nmajority of the employees in an appropriate unit who cast valid ballots in the \nelection,” id. § 7111(a).  \n12.  The Statute also requires agencies to negotiate in good faith with such \nrepresentatives to reach a collective bargaining agreement, 5 U.S.C. § 7114(b)(5), \nwhile setting out proscribed agency and union unfair labor practices, including a \nrefusal by an agency or union to bargain in good faith, 5 U.S.C. § 7116(a) and (b). \nThe Statute established an independent agency, the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority (“FLRA”), to resolve unfair labor practice complaints, 5 U.S.C. § 7104, as \nwell as exceptions to arbitral awards issued under grievance procedures set out in \ncollective bargaining agreements. 5 U.S.C. § 7105(2)(a).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 6 of 32\n13.  At the same time, given the Federal government’s “special \nrequirements and needs,” id. § 7101(b), Congress placed limits on the scope of \nbargaining.  The FSLMR Statute provides statutory management rights protections \nthat preserve “the authority of any management official of any agency” to, inter \nalia, “determine the mission, budget, organization, number of employees, and \ninternal security practices of the agency”; “hire, assign, direct, layoff, and retain \nemployees in the agency, or to suspend, remove, reduce in grade or pay, or take \nother disciplinary action against such employees”; and “assign work, .. make \ndeterminations with respect to contracting out, and ... determine the personnel by \nwhich agency operations shall be conducted.” 5 U.S.C. § 7106(a).  \n14.  The FSLMR Statute contains a narrow provision under which \nemployees may be excluded from coverage based on their agency’s involvement in \nnational security. The Statute provides that: \n \nThe President may issue an order excluding any agency or \nsubdivision thereof from coverage under this chapter if the President \ndetermines that— \n \n(A) the agency or subdivision has as a primary function \nintelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security \nwork, and \n \n(B) the provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to that \nagency or subdivision in a manner consistent with national security \nrequirements and considerations. \n \n \n5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1). \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 7 of 32\nThe President issues Executive Order 14251 \n \n  15.  On March 27, 2025, Defendant Trump issued Executive Order No. \n14251, Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Programs, 90 Fed. Reg. 14553 \n(Mar. 27, 2025), which invoked 5 U.S.C. §7103(b) and terminated the collective \nbargaining rights of employees in ten Cabinet level departments and seven \nindependent agencies whose “primary function” is ostensibly national security, \nallegedly because the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute “cannot \nbe applied to these agencies and agency subdivisions in a manner consistent with \nnational security requirements and considerations.”  This Executive Order also \nexcluded every Federal agency’s Office of Chief Information Officer.  \n  16.  President Trump’s initial Executive Order stripped collective \nbargaining rights from three-quarters of the federal employees who were \nrepresented by federal sector unions, demonstrating that it was not a targeted \nassessment based on national security concerns. See Hassan Ali Kanu, Trump \nMoves to Strip Unionization Rights from Most Federal Workers, Politico.com, \navailable at https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/28/union-rights-federal-workers-\ndonald-trump-00257010(Mar. 28, 2025). But for the time being, the Plaintiffs \nNWSEO and POPA were unaffected.  \n  17.  The White House issued a “fact sheet” simultaneously with Executive \nOrder 14251 in which it candidly admitted that the President’s Executive Order \nwas issued to curtail the power of and to punish those particular labor \norganizations who had ostensibly “obstructed” the President’s efforts to illegally \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 8 of 32\ndismantle the Federal government, to coerce employees into resigning by \nterminating telework, and to illegally dismiss large segments of the Federal \nworkforce these labor organizations represent, by filing grievances: \n \nPresident Trump is taking action to ensure that agencies vital to \nnational security can execute their missions without delay and protect \nthe American people. The President needs a responsive and \naccountable civil service to protect our national security.  \nCertain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s \nagenda. \n \nThe largest Federal union describes itself as “fighting back” against \nTrump. It is widely filing grievances to block Trump policies. \n \nFor example, VA’s unions have filed 70 national and local grievances \nover President Trump’s policies since the inauguration—an average of \nover one a day.  \n \nProtecting America’s national security is a core constitutional duty, \nand President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his \nefforts to protect Americans and our national interests.  \n \nPresident Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who \nwork with him; he will not tolerate mass obstruction that jeopardizes \nhis ability to manage agencies with vital national security missions.  \n \n \nFact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Exempts Agencies with National Security \nMissions from Federal Collective Bargaining Requirements, \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-\ntrump-exempts-agencies-with-national-security-missions-from-federal-collective-\nbargaining-requirements/ (last visited April 1, 2025).  \n  18.  What is equally revealing about the scope of the exclusions in \nExecutive Order 14251 is the agencies and employees that were not excluded: The \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 9 of 32\nPresident did not exclude those agencies or employees “with unions who work with \nhim” politically and who do not oppose his efforts to neuter the civil service or, as he \ndisparagingly calls it, “the deep state.” Section 2 of the Executive Order carves out \nprotections for the unions who have not opposed his policies or politics: \nNotwithstanding the forgoing, nothing in this section shall exempt \nfrom the coverage of Chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code: \n(a) the immediate, local employing offices of any agency police \nofficers, security guards, or firefighters, provided that this \nexclusion does not apply to the Bureau of Prisons; \n \n19.  The country’s largest law enforcement union, the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police (“FOP”), endorsed President Trump’s candidacy in 2016, 2020, and \n2024, and President Trump has regularly touted those endorsements. And the \nlargest firefighters’ union in the country, the IAFF, after having exclusively \nsupported Democratic presidential candidates for more than 50 years, broke with \nthat tradition, declining to endorse either candidate in the 2016 and 2024 elections \nand in 2020, then-candidate Trump touted his endorsement by one of IAFF’s larger \nchapters.     \n  20.  The Executive Order excluded 12 subdivisions of the Department of \nHomeland Security - but it did not exclude U.S. Customs and Border Protection. See \nSection 2, subsection 1-407. The National Border Patrol Council represents \napproximately 18,000 employees of Customs and Border Protection, and it endorsed \nDonald Trump for election in 2016, 2020 and 2024.  \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 10 of 32\n \n \nPlaintiffs NWSEO and POPA “fight back” against the Defendant Trump’s \nattacks on Federal employees and public services. \n \n21.  Despite Defendant Trump’s diktat that he would not “let union \nobstruction interfere with his efforts” by “widely filing grievances to block Trump \npolicies” and his threat that he “will not tolerate mass obstruction that jeopardizes \nhis ability to manage agencies,” Plaintiffs POPA and NWSEO continued to fulfill \ntheir legal duty to protect the interests of their members – and well as the public \nthey serve – by filing grievances against the Defendants’ efforts to harass, \nundermine and dismantle the civil service and the mission of Federal agencies.  \n \nPOPA stands firm. \n22.  In order to “increase production” (i.e., examine more patent \napplications) at the expense of the “quality” or legal validity of patents, the \nDefendant Stewart suspended all non-essential training conducted on duty-time, \nincluding a bank of hours that examiners could use for continuing technical \neducation. POPA grieved this violation of the POPA-USPTO collective bargaining \nagreement and when the grievance was denied, invoked arbitration. The matter is \npresently pending before a Federal labor arbitrator.  \n23.  According to its Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report on Telework,  \n“the USPTO continues to be a leader of telework in the federal government. At the \nUSPTO, telework is a business strategy that supports mission achievement and \ngoal fulfillment,” including $68 million annual savings in real estate costs. By the \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 11 of 32\nend of FY 2023, 96% of USPTO employees teleworked, and 86% teleworked full-\ntime.  \n24.  On January 20, 2025 the Defendant Trump issued a “Return to In-\nPerson Work” order to undermine rather than enhance the operations of Federal \nagencies. Its goal was to coerce Federal employees to quit. In a Wall Street Journal \neditorial, DOGE Directors Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy wrote: “Requiring \nfederal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of \nvoluntary terminations that we welcome.” The DOGE Plan to Reform Government, \nWALL STREET JOURNAL, (Nov. 20, 2024) https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-\nramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-\nexecutive-power-grab-fa51c020 (Last visited May 31, 2025).  \n25.  In order to implement this “Return to In-Person Work” order, the \nDefendant Stewart began to cancel in phases telework at the USPTO. On April 14, \n2025 she cancelled telework for probationary patent examiners, 11% of whom \npromptly quit. POPA grieved this violation of the POPA-USPTO collective \nbargaining agreement and when the grievance was denied, invoked arbitration. The \nmatter is presently pending before a Federal labor arbitrator and a hearing is \nscheduled for November 17, 2025. \n26.  On May 19, 2025 Defendant Stewart notified POPA that employees it \nrepresented in the Office of Chief Financial Officer, Office of Chief Information \nOfficer, Office of General Counsel, Patent and Trademark Appeals Board, Office of \nPolicy and International Affairs and Office of Government Affairs who live within \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 12 of 32\n50 miles of the USPTO headquarters could no longer routinely telework. POPA \ngrieved this violation of the POPA-USPTO collective bargaining agreement and \nwhen the grievance was denied, invoked arbitration. The matter is presently \npending before a Federal labor arbitrator and a hearing is scheduled for December \n2, 2025. \n27.  The USPTO routinely grants two-hours of excused absence from duty \non the day before Federal holidays. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 \nprovides that the head of each executive agency shall ensure that teleworkers and \nnon-teleworkers are treated the same for purposes of work requirements or other \nacts involving managerial discretion. 5 U.S.C. § 6503(a). However, in order to \npressure employees to abandon telework, beginning with the 2025 Memorial Day \nholiday the Defendant Stewart granted early dismissal to USPTO employees who \nworked on-site, but denied it to teleworkers. POPA grieved this violation of the \nTelework Enhancement Act and the POPA-USPTO collective bargaining agreement \nand when the grievance was denied, invoked arbitration. The Federal Mediation \nand Conciliation Service has provided the USPTO and POPA a list of potential \narbitrators but the parties have yet to select one to hear the matter. \n28.  On June 3, 2025 the USPTO conducted a “Town Hall” with employees \nat which the Defendant Lutnick spoke. Employees who were working at the USPTO \nheadquarters (i.e., those who were not teleworking) were excused from work in \norder to attend. However, teleworkers were invited to attend virtually (as the Town \nHall was streamed) but were not excused from work to do so and were required to \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 13 of 32\nattend on their own time. POPA grieved this violation of the Telework \nEnhancement Act and the POPA-USPTO collective bargaining agreement and the \ngrievance was denied.  \n29.  As noted, the USPTO routinely grants its employees early dismissal \nbefore Federal holidays. However, in a break with past practice and in an act of \nracial bias (if not outright racial insult), Defendant Stewart failed to grant USPTO \nemployees early dismissal before the 2025 Juneteenth holiday. POPA grieved this \nviolation of past practice and when the grievance was denied, invoked arbitration. \nThe Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service has provided the USPTO and \nPOPA a list of potential arbitrators but the parties have yet selected one to hear the \nmatter. \n30.  The Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute guarantees \nthe right of Federal employee unions to participate in any “formal discussion” \nbetween management and employees “concerning any grievance or any personnel \npolicy or practices or other general condition of employment.” 5 U.S.C. § \n7114(a)(2)(A). The USPTO has until now honored that obligation by allowing \nPOPA’s President or other representative to participate in recurring “Town Hall” \nmeetings management has held with employees at which working conditions are \nroutinely discussed. However, when the Defendant Stewart denied POPA’s \nPresident the opportunity to participate in a “Town Hall” meeting she held with \nthousands of employees on March 27, 2025 at which she discussed telework, the \ngovernment-wide hiring freeze, overtime, the suspension of training, employee \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 14 of 32\nawards, and other “personnel polic[ies] or practices or other general condition of \nemployment,” POPA filed an unfair labor practice charge which is under \ninvestigation by the Office of General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority.   \nNWSEO stands firm. \n32.  In “Project 2025: Presidential Transition Project” the Heritage \nFoundation wrote that “the NWS should fully commercialize its forecasting \noperations.” Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, at 675. The \nPlaintiff NWSEO has opposed the efforts of the Defendants Trump, Lutnick and \nGrimm to dismantle the NWS.   \n33.  Through a combination of the Defendant Trump’s January 20, 2025 \ngovernment-wide hiring freeze, the February 14, 2025 mass termination of \nprobationary employees in NWS and throughout the Federal government, the \nJanuary 28, 2025 offer of “deferred resignation” with pay until September 2025  \n(a/k/a the “fork in the road”), and the offering of voluntary separation incentives and \nvoluntary early retirement, the Defendants Trump, Lutnick and Grimm have \nsuccessfully drawn down the 4,000 member workforce of the National Weather \nService by over 600 employees. As a result, the NWS has been forced to close \nnumerous Weather Forecast Offices at night, reduce the frequency of weather \nballon launches thereby degrading the quality of the weather models that rely on \nthe data obtained by those launches, and curtail other services.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 15 of 32\n34.  NWSEO launched an aggressive lobbying and press campaign to \noppose these reductions in staff and services. These efforts have produced news \nstories in which NWSEO official have been interviewed, such as:  \n“As NOAA cuts loom, scientists and industry are pushing back,” Washington \nPost, (March 7, 2025); \n“As NOAA braces for more cuts, scientists say public safety is at risk,” PBS \nNews, (March 14);  \n \n“How Weather Service Layoffs Could Affect North Texas During Tornado \nSeason,” Dallas Observer, (March 25); \n \n“Weather Service Prepares for ‘Degraded Operations’ Amid Trump Cuts,” \nNew York Times  (April 16);  \n \n“Weather service prepares for ‘degraded operations’ amid Trump \ncuts,” Seattle Times, (April 16); \n \n“How Trump’s National Weather Service Cuts Could Cost Lives,” Scientific \nAmerican (May 13);  \n \n“The Weather Service has a plan to reinvent itself: Did DOGE Stop it?.” New \nYork Times  (May 15); \n \n“After Cuts, a Kentucky Weather Office Scrambles for Staffing as Severe \nStorms Bear Down,” New York Times  (May 16);  \n \n“Kentucky NWS forecast office faced federal staffing cuts before deadly \ntornadoes hit,” USA Today  (May 17);  \n \n“First came the weather service staffing cuts. Then came the tornadoes,” USA \nToday,  (May 20); \n \n“National Weather Service Cuts concerns KC area officials,” Kansas City Star  \n(May 28);  \n \n“2025 hurricane season could see degraded forecasts because of weather \nservice cuts,” Palm Beach Post (June 6); \n \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 16 of 32\n“'Lives are at stake:' Deadly Texas storms put spotlight on Trump's weather \nagency Cuts,” BBC online (June 9); \n \n“Staff vacancies hit Texas weather offices as they brace for a busy hurricane \nseason,” Texas Tribune (June 9); \n \n“ ‘Sledgehammer’ to science: Job cuts, Trump budget plans spark hurricane \nfears,” Orlando Sentinel (July 10); \n \n“Staffing shortages at NOAA, National Weather Service raise safety concerns \nin South Florida,” in CBS News Miami online (July 11); \n \n“As Floods Hit, Key Roles Were Vacant at Weather Service Offices in Texas,” \nNew York Times, (July 5);  \n \n“Weather Service Staffing 'Clearly a Concern' Ahead of Deadly Texas Floods,” \nNewsweek, (July 5); and \n \n“Trump cuts to California National Weather Service leave ‘critical’ Holes,” \nLos Angeles Times (July 16).   \n \n35.  NWSEO officials have been interviewed about these staffing and services \ncuts on televised news broadcasts including: \n“Forecasters union expresses ‘grave concern' about NWS staffing this storm  \nseason,” NBC News Dallas-Fort Worth (March 11, 2025)  \n \n“Job cuts at NOAA drive concerns about extreme weather forecasts, as \nclimate change worsens natural disasters,” CBS Evening News Plus (March \n13) \n     \nBBC News (May 20, 2025)  \n“Tornadoes expose staffing crisis at National Weather Service.” WMUR (May \n20).  \nKSEE24 Hanford News (May 21, 2025)  \n \nMSNBC Reports (May 27, 2025) \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 17 of 32\n36.  NWSEO officials have been interviewed in at least 40 news stories in \nboth national and local media concerning these cutbacks.  \n37.  Under the NWS-NWSEO collective bargaining agreement, the agency \nis required to make a temporary promotion of an existing employee “as soon as \npracticable” after a position becomes vacant, pending selection of a permanent \nreplacement. As a result of the government-wide hiring freeze imposed by \nDefendant Trump on January 20, 2025, the NWS refused to make these required \ntemporary promotions but instead assigned employees the higher graded duties of \nthese prolonged vacancies without higher graded pay. NWSEO grieved this \nviolation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. But instead of providing a \nresponse to the merits of the grievance as required by the agreement, on June 9 the \nNWS wrote instead that “providing a response to your grievance would \ncontravene with the current priorities of the administration.” The union invoked \narbitration and the matter is now set to be heard by a Federal labor arbitrator on \nDecember 16, 2025.  \n38.  Although most NWS employees are weather forecasters or others \nengaged in operations that normally require them to be in a forecast facility to \nmonitor and forecast the weather, flooding, and tsunamis, over 360 employees \nrepresented by NWSEO whose work is more administrative or can be performed \nfrom outside the office have routinely teleworked. This right to telework was \nconfirmed in an agreement negotiated in 2022 at the end of the COVID pandemic \nwhich demonstrated that many duties performed by NWS employees could be \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 18 of 32\nsuccessfully and efficiently performed at home. Even operational employees were \nguaranteed the right to telework when assigned to supernumerary or \nadministrative non-operational shifts. This all came to an end when the NWS \nimplemented Defendant Trump’s Return to In-Person Work order by cancelling \ntelework throughout the NWS. On April 9, 2025 NWSEO grieved this violation of \nthe NWSEO-NWS collective bargaining agreement and when the grievance was \ndenied, invoked arbitration. The matter is presently pending before a Federal labor \narbitrator and a hearing is scheduled for November 20, 2025.  \n39.  In 2002, NWSEO was granted “national consultation rights” by the \nDepartment of Commerce. Under the FSLMR Statute, before it changes conditions \nof employment at an agency or departmentwide level, those unions that have \nnational consultation rights must be afforded prior notice and “a reasonable time \nto present its views and recommendations regarding the changes.” The \nagency must then “consider the views or recommendations before taking final \naction” and “provide the labor organization a written statement of the reasons for \ntaking the final action.” 5 U.S.C. § 7113. On January 24, 2025 the Department of \nCommerce unilaterally eliminated its telework program without providing NWSEO \na reasonable opportunity to present its views as required by the Statute. NWSEO \nfiled an unfair labor practice charge with the FLRA over this violation of its \nconsultation rights, which is under investigation by the FLRA Office of General \nCounsel.  \n   \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 19 of 32\nDefendant Trump issues a new Executive Order \n40.  The Defendant Trump carried through on his promise that he “will not \ntolerate” any union that challenges implementation of his policies, including POPA \nand NWSEO. On August 28, 2025 Defendant Trump issued a new Executive Order, \nFurther Exclusions from the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program, \nexempting six additional agencies from the coverage of the FSLMR Statute under \nthe authority of 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b)(1) because their unions were not among those \n“constructive partnerships” that would “who work with him.”  \n41.  Among the agencies that were exempted from coverage of the FSLMR \nStatute by this new Executive Order was the “Office of the Commissioner for \nPatents and subordinate units, Patent and Trademark Office,” which includes the \nnearly 9,000 patent examiners represented by POPA. Section 2(b), revising section \n1-411 of Executive Order 12171 of November 19, 1979.  \n42.  Also among the agencies that were exempted from coverage of the \nFSLMR Statute were two NOAA line offices whose employees are represented by \nNWSEO – the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service and \nthe National Weather Service. Section 2(b), revising section 1-411 of Executive \nOrder 12171 of November 19, 1979.  \n43.  The White House simultaneously issued a “Fact Sheet” containing \nspurious reasons why these additional agencies were exempted from the FSLMR \nStatute.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 20 of 32\n44.  Section 7103(b)(1)(A) of the Statute authorizes the President to exempt \nagencies or subdivisions of agencies only if “the agency or subdivision has as a \nprimary function  . . . national security work.” (emphasis added). According to the \nFact Sheet, the Office of the Commissioner of Patents was excluded because: \n \nThe Invention Secrecy Act tasks the PTO with reviewing inventions \nmade in the United States, assessing whether their release could harm \nnational security, and if so, issuing secrecy orders that prevent public \ndisclosure. Effectively performing this work is essential to ensuring \nU.S. inventions with military or other national security applications do \nnot fall into enemy hands. \n \n45.  However, the USPTO does not assess whether the release of patent \napplications could harm national security. Under the Invention Security Act, 35 \nU.S.C. § 181, patent applications whose release might be detrimental to national \nsecurity are referred to the Atomic Energy Commission, the Secretary of Defense or \nother defense agencies who make the determination whether the publication or \ndisclosure of the invention would be detrimental to national security and should be \nkept secret. Rather than being a primary function of the USPTO, the screening of \nthe patent applications for referral to the defense agencies is an ancillary duty of \njust 26 patent examiners in the Office of Licensing and Review of the nearly 9,000 \nexaminers employed by the USPTO. And only about 50 of the 600,000 patent \napplications received each year by the USPTO are ultimately subject to a secrecy \norder after being assessed by the defense agencies.   \n46.  The grounds for exclusion of NWS and NESDIS are equally spurious. \nAccording to the White House Fact Sheet: \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 21 of 32\n \nToday NWS and NESDIS provide weather and climate data that \ninform the weather forecasting used to plan U.S. military deployments. \nWeather forecasts have long been critical factor [sic] in the success or \nfailure of military operations. \n \nWhile the latter statement is true, the former statement simply isn’t. The NWS \ndoes not provide the military with weather forecasts for military operations. The \nmilitary departments have their own weather forecasting units (such as the Fleet \nWeather Centers in Norfolk and San Diego, the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and \nOceanography Center in Monterey, the 1St Combat Weather Squadron at Fort \nLewis, and the 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base and many others) that \nprovide forecasting and support for military operations.  \n  47.  NESDIS does track and command three polar orbiting weather \nsatellites known as the “Defense Meteorological Satellite Program” along with \nNOAA’s own weather satellites. But DOD will cease processing the data from these \nsatellites in 2026 as they are replaced by a new generation of military weather \nsatellites.  \n  48.  The August 28, 2025 White House Fact Sheet also erroneously stated \nthat these exclusions were necessary because delays caused by collective \nbargaining “can impact the ability of agencies with national security \nresponsibilities to implement policies swiftly and fulfill their critical missions” \nand that bargaining “can delay the implementation of time-sensitive national \nsecurity measures.”  The FSLMR Statute preserves management’s right “to take \nwhatever actions may be necessary to carry out the agency mission during \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 22 of 32\nemergencies.” 5 U.S.C. § 7106(a). And an agency need not complete bargaining \nbefore changing conditions of employment when immediate implementation is \n“consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, such that a delay in \nimplementation would have impeded the agency’s ability to effectively and \nefficiently carry out its mission.” SPORT and Dep’t of Air Force, Edwards AFB, 68 \nF.L.R.A. 9, 10-11 (2014), recon. denied, 68 F.L.R.A. 107 (2014).  \n  49.  On August 28, 2025 the Acting Director of the USPTO’s Office of \nHuman Resources sent the President of POPA a memorandum informing the union \nthat the USPTO would apply the August 28, 2025 Executive Order to the Office of \nCommissioner of Patents, and that it would also apply Executive Order 14251 of \nMarch 27, 2025 to the Office of Chief Information Officer, which it had not done to \ndate. This notice read in pertinent part:  \nThe Agency will no longer recognize POPA as the exclusive \nrepresentative for any employees in Patents and OCIO [Office of Chief \nInformation Officer].  \nIn alignment with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \nGuidance on Executive Order Exclusions from Federal Labor-\nManagement Programs (Exclusions), dated March 27, 2025, the \nAgency will terminate payroll deductions of union dues for employees \nin Patents and OCIO who are no longer in the bargaining unit as soon \nas practicable under 5 U.S.C. § 7115.  \nPatents and OCIO employees will no longer be entitled to “official \ntime,” described in 5 U.S.C. § 7131 to carry out their representational \nduties since they are no longer bargaining unit employees or covered \nby the CBA.  \nThe Agency will discontinue its participation in grievance and \narbitration procedures arising under the Statute involving disputes \nbrought on behalf of employees in Patents and/or OCIO, including \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 23 of 32\nthose matters currently pending before a grievance official and/or \narbitrator. \n  \n  50.  On August 29, 2025 NOAA’s Director of Workforce Relations Division \nsent NWSEO’s President a notice that stated:  \n \nPursuant to Executive Order “Further Exclusions from the Federal \nLabor-Management Relations Program” (August 28, 2025)  . . .  the \nNational Weather Service (NWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) hereby terminates any and all collective \nbargaining agreements currently in effect between NWS and the \nNational Weather Service Employee Organization (NWSEO). This is \neffective immediately. \n   \n51.  Similarly, on August 29, 2025 NOAA’s Director of Workforce Relations \nDivision sent NWSEO’s senior official at NESDIS a notice that stated:  \n \nPursuant to Executive Order “Further Exclusions from the Federal \nLabor-Management Relations Program” (August 28, 2025) . . .  the \nNational Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service \n(NESDIS), Office of Satellite and Product Operations (OSPO), National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) hereby terminates \nany and all collective bargaining agreements currently in effect between \nthe NESDIS, OSPO and the National Weather Service Employee \nOrganization (NWSEO). This is effective immediately. \n \n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nFirst Cause of Action \nUltra Vires (Violation of Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute) \n \n52.   Plaintiffs reassert and reallege the allegations contained in paragraphs \n1 through 51 as if fully set forth here. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 24 of 32\n53.  Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoin and declare \nunlawful official action that is ultra vires. Courts have jurisdiction to grant relief \nwhen the President and his subordinate officials act beyond the scope of their \nauthority and violate the law to the injury of an individual or organization.  \n54.  The President may exclude an agency or subdivision from coverage of \nthe Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute only if that subdivision \nhas as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or \nnational security work, and only if the provisions of the Statute cannot be applied \nto that subdivision in a manner consistent with national security requirements and \nconsiderations. \n55.  The President is not entitled to any presumption of regularity that \nmight otherwise be due him when he issued the two Executive Orders because the \nDefendant was indifferent to the purposes of the Federal Service Labor \nManagement Relations Statute and has acted deliberately in contravention of them. \nThe President’s invocation of Section 7103(b) to now exclude well over two-thirds of \nthe federal workforce – coupled with contemporaneous evidence reflecting \nmotivations for the Executive Orders plainly outside those contemplated by statute \n– represents that the two Executive Orders patently disregard the specific and \nunambiguous directives in the FSLMR Statute. The fact sheets that the White \nHouse issued accompanying the companion Executive Orders reveal other motives \nfor terminating the Plaintiffs’ and other labor organizations’ collective bargaining \nrights, as does the sweeping scope of the Orders as well as the selective exclusions \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 25 of 32\nfrom the Orders of a handful of favored unions (such as the police unions and \nBorder Patrol agents) who are viewed as supporters of the President’s agenda.  The \nfact sheets exaggerate if not misstate both the national security responsibilities of \nthe agencies being excluded as well as misrepresent the agencies’ bargaining \nobligations under the statute when there is an exigency or emergency and thus \ndemonstrate that the reasons proffered for issuing the two Executive Orders are a \npretext for other impermissible and extra-statutory motivations. Therefore, the two \nExecutive Orders, taken as a whole, exceed the President’s authority and are ultra \nvires.  \n56.  Alternatively, since “national security work” is not a responsibility of \nNWS, NESDIS, Office of the Commissioner for Patents or the USPTO’s Office of \nChief Information Officer, no less their “primary function,” the President clearly \nexceeded the authority granted to him by Congress in 5 U.S.C. § 7103(b) when he \nexempted the NWS, NESDIS, Office of the Commissioner for Patents and the \nUSPTO’s Office of Chief Information Officer, from coverage of the FSLMR Statute. \nIn so doing, the Defendant Trump exercised power that was specifically withheld by \nCongress and acted in contravention of a specific statutory prohibition and \ntherefore his action was ultra vires.  \n57.  The Defendants Lutnick and Grimm and their subordinates’ actions in \nterminating the collective bargaining agreements with NWSEO covering employees \nof the NWS and NESDIS are ultra vires because they rely on and enforce an \nillegally issued and invalid Executive Order. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 26 of 32\n58.  The Defendants Lutnick and Stewart and their subordinates’ actions \nin terminating recognition of POPA as the collective bargaining representative of \nthe employees in the Office of the Patent Commissioner and in USPTO’s Office of \nChief Information Officer and the termination of those employees’ official time, dues \nallotment and pending grievances is also ultra vires because they rely on and \nenforce an illegally issued and invalid Executive Order.  \n \nSecond Cause of Action \nViolation of NWSEO’s and POPA’s First Amendment Rights \n  59.  Plaintiffs reassert and reallege the allegations contained in paragraphs \n1 through 58 as if fully set forth here. \n  60.  The right of public employees to assemble and to petition for redress of \ngrievances by filing grievances through a negotiated union grievance procedure is \nprotected by the First Amendment and public employees have a right to be free \nfrom retaliation for engaging in such activities. Morfin v. Albuquerque Public \nSchools, 906 F.2d 1434, 1438 (10th Cir. 1990); Petrario v. Cutler, 187 F.Supp.2d 26, \n31-32 (D. Conn. 2002); Stellmaker v. DePetrillo, 710 F.Supp. 891, 892-93 (D. Conn. \n1989).  \n61.  POPA’s grievances against the Trump Administration’s termination of \ntelework, discrimination against teleworkers with regard to early dismissal and time \nto attend Town Halls, elimination of training, and failure to grant early dismissal for \nthe Juneteenth holiday, and the filing of the unfair labor practice charge concerning \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 27 of 32\nthe refusal to allow POPA to participate in the “formal discussion” at the Town Hall \nmeeting, constitute First Amendment activity by POPA and its members.  \n62.  NWSEO’s grievances against the Trump Administration’s termination \nof telework and refusal to make temporary promotions, its unfair labor practice \ncharge filed for failing to honor its national consultation rights, and its lobbying and \naggressive press campaign and interviews warning the public about staffing and \nservice cuts at the NWS, constitute First Amendment activity by NWSEO and its \nmembers. \n  63.  The Executive Order retaliates against NWSEO and POPA and its \nmembers for that protected First Amendment activity. Indeed, the White House’s \nFact Sheet on the Executive Order 14251 threatens such retaliatory action \nagainst those unions who continue to “widely fil[e] grievances to block Trump \npolicies.” \n  64.  The fact that the POPA and NWSEO bargaining units were not \nincluded among the first tranche of exemptions in the March Executive Order but \nwere excluded after they engaged in robust opposing to the Defendants’ policies, \nevinces that national security concerns were not the motivation for their \nexclusion. The Defendant Trump made a threat in the fact sheet which \naccompanied Executive Order 14251 that he “will not tolerate mass obstruction” \nthat was carried out only after it was not heeded by the Plaintiffs.  \n  65.  The Executive Orders collectively constitute “viewpoint \ndiscrimination” because they exclude those labor organizations which have been \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 28 of 32\nsupportive of the Defendant Trump. As the Fact Sheet frankly explains, \n“President Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who work with \nhim” but that “he will not tolerate mass obstruction that jeopardizes his ability to \nmanage agencies with vital national security missions.”  \n  66.   Defendants have also acted to illegally curtail and infringe Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment rights by carrying out the Executive Orders and terminating \nPlaintiffs’ collective bargaining rights and abrogating their collective bargaining \nagreements and the privileges and benefits Plaintiffs enjoy under the Statute and \nwhich they have negotiated in its collective bargaining agreements.  \n  67.  The Executive Orders thus “constitutes a sufficiently adverse action” \nagainst Plaintiffs “to give rise to an actionable First Amendment claim.” Hous. \nCmty. Coll. Sys. v. Wilson, 595 U.S. 468, 477 (2022). The Orders collectively, in \nother words, “would deter a similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from \nexercising his or her constitutional rights.” Connelly v. Cnty. of Rockland, 61 F.4th \n322, 325 (2d Cir. 2023).  \nThird Cause of Action \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment’s Guarantee of  \nEqual Protection of the Laws \n \n  68.  Plaintiffs reassert and reallege the allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 67 as if fully set forth here. \n  69.  The due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution includes a guarantee of equal protection. See United States v. \nWindsor, 570 U.S. 744, 769–70 (2013); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954).  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 29 of 32\n70.   “The Constitution’s guarantee of equality ‘must at the very least mean \nthat a bare . . .  desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot’ justify \ndisparate treatment of that group.” Windsor, 570 U.S. at 770 (quoting Dep’t of \nAgriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534–35 (1973)).  \n71.   A “bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group” is precisely \nwhat motivated the Executive Orders’ exclusion of 75% of union-represented \nemployees across multiple Cabinet departments and independent agencies, while \nproviding a blanket exception for agency police and firefighters, whose unions have \nsupported President Trump. This conclusion is all the more inescapable given the \nWhite House’s statements admitting that the purpose of the exclusions is to harm \nand punish federal unions like NWSEO and POPA that have voiced opposition to \nTrump Administration policies and petitioned the government for redress from \nthose policies.  \n72.  The Executive Orders and actions of the Defendants have denied \nNWSEO and POPA and their members of equal protection of the laws because they \nhave stripped them of their collective bargaining rights and simultaneously allowed \nthe employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and members of police and \nfirefighter unions who support the President politically to retain their collective \nbargaining rights. \nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs National Weather Service Employees \nOrganization and Patent Office Professional Association request judgment against \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02947     Document 1     Filed 09/02/25     Page 30 of 32\nthe Defendants: \nA.
