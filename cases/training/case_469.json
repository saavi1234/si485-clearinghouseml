      "text": "710 F.2d 496 (1983)\nIn re Sarah Ann HORACEK, et al.; United States, Intervenor,\nv.\nCharles THONE, et al., Appellees,\nRichard Douglas McClain, Attorney for James Michael Jonas, Appellant.\nNo. 82-2384.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.\nSubmitted June 22, 1983.\nDecided June 30, 1983.\n497 *497 Paul L. Douglas, Atty. Gen., Melvin K. Kammerlohr, Asst. Atty. Gen., Lincoln, Neb., for appellees.\nRichard Douglas McClain, Lincoln, Neb., for appellant James Michael Jonas.\nBefore BRIGHT, ROSS and JOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judges.\nROSS, Circuit Judge.\n[1]\nAttorney Richard McClain appeals the district court  denial of his application for attorney fees. McClain seeks\nfees under the consent decree entered in the case of Horacek v. Exon, Civil No. 72-L-299 (D.Neb.1975). The\ndistrict court denied McClain's application on the ground that the court lacks the authority to grant the fees under\nthe decree, statutes and case law. We affirm.\nI.\nThe instant litigation is based on the case of Horacek v. Exon, Civil No. 72-L-299 (D.Neb.1975). That case was\nbrought under the Civil Rights Act against state officials by certain parents of and on behalf of the residents of the\nBeatrice State Home. The plaintiffs alleged that the conditions of confinement there were violative of the eighth\namendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The parties eventually entered into a consent decree\napproved by the district court on October 31, 1975. The consent decree provided, among other things, for\nperiodic evaluations to determine the most appropriate manner to transfer residents of the Beatrice State Home\n(Beatrice) to community based mental health facilities. It provided that in the event that either the parent or legal\nguardian of any resident of the home objected to such a transfer, a due process hearing must be held before the\nState Department of Public Institutions (DPI). Paragraphs 19 through 22 of the consent decree set out the\nstandards for the administrative hearings, including a requirement that the DPI appoint competent counsel to\nrepresent the interests of each Beatrice resident.\nJames M. Jonas has been a resident-patient of Beatrice since sometime prior to May 20, 1954. Gerald Jonas is\nJames' father and guardian. Early in 1978, Gerald Jonas was notified that Beatrice planned to transfer James to\na community based program. The elder Jonas hired attorney McClain to represent James' parents in the\nprehearing placement proceedings before the DPI. McClain then requested the DPI to furnish James with\ncounsel to represent his interests at the hearing. McClain asked that he be appointed as such counsel.\nThe DPI initially took the position that it was not required under the Horacek consent decree to appoint counsel to\nrepresent James, but subsequently reversed that position when the office of the Attorney General of the State of\n498 Nebraska informed DPI *498 that its interpretation of Horacek required the Attorney General to do so. However,\nbecause DPI lacked budgetary authorization to pay attorney fees and no statutory authority existed under\nNebraska law to allow for the taxation of attorney fees against the state in this situation, DPI attempted to fulfill its\nresponsibility to appoint counsel for James by seeking the aid of the Southeast Nebraska Legal Services Agency,\nthe Lancaster County Public Defender, the County Attorney for James' home county, the Department of Welfare's\n\nAdvocacy Program for the Developmentally Disabled, and finally the President of the Gage County Bar\nAssociation. It would appear that the Gage County Bar Association was successful in providing the DPI hearing\nexaminer who was to preside at the hearing with the names of two attorneys willing to be appointed to represent\nJames. It would further appear that the DPI was successful in finding limited budgetary appropriations for\nattorney fees and set a $350 fee limit for the attorneys willing to be appointed to represent Beatrice residents at\ndue process hearings held by the DPI.\nHowever, before the hearing examiner could appoint counsel as requested by DPI, Gerald Jonas requested the\nCounty Court of Dakota County to appoint McClain as both attorney and guardian ad litem for James \"at\ngovernment expense\" to represent him in the deinstitutionalization hearing. On June 9, 1978, the county court\ngranted the application and appointed McClain \"to act as attorney and guardian ad litem for James Jonas at\ngovernment expense.\" Thereafter, the DPI objected to the county court order appointing McClain, contending that\nthe county court had no jurisdiction in matters relating to compliance with the consent decree in Horacek and\nfurthermore that McClain, as attorney for the parents of James Jonas, who opposed community placement for\nJames, represented interests which the Horacek consent decree recognized may be in conflict with the best\ninterests of James himself and, therefore, could not represent both the interests of the parents and the interests\nof James at the due process hearing.\nThe county court overruled the objections of the DPI and entered another order confirming McClain's\nappointment. The due process hearing was conducted with McClain acting as attorney for both James and his\nparents, who opposed community placement. After the hearing, McClain applied for attorney fees in the county\ncourt in which he was appointed, and the County Court judge found that fees in the sum of $3,100 should be\nallowed, but that the fees should not be paid by Dakota County and \"were the expense of some other\ngovernmental body.\" McClain appealed to the state district court which ruled that the county court did not have\nsubject matter jurisdiction of the original appointment of McClain. McClain then appealed to the Nebraska\nSupreme Court which held that the county court lacked the authority to appoint a guardian ad litem for James or\nto fix fees in the manner in which it did. See In Re Guardianship of Jonas, 211 Neb. 397, 318 N.W.2d 867 (1982).\nOn his appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court, McClain argued that the action of the county court was justified\nunder several Nebraska statutes, not the Horacek consent decree, but the court rejected his arguments and\nconcluded that it was \"unable to find any statutory authority to justify the action taken by the county judge in this\ncase.\" 211 Neb. at 401, 318 N.W.2d 867. The supreme court also noted that while \"every court has inherent\npower to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent an incapacitated person in proceedings before that court, that\npower does not extend to the appointment of such guardian for the purpose of managing litigation in another\ncourt or tribunal except for necessary appeals.\" (Citation omitted.) Id.\nAfter his denial in state court, McClain applied for attorney fees in the United States District Court, urging that the\nfederal court had the authority to award them under the Horacek consent decree. He relied on paragraph 8 of the\ncourt's decree of October 31, 1975, which states:\n499 8) Jurisdiction is retained by this Court until further order. Any party may *499 apply at any time for\nsuch further order as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction or implementation of\nthis Decree or for the enforcement of this Decree. Any party may move for such further relief as\nthe interests of justice in this case may require.\nHe also cited paragraph 19 of the August 6, 1975 agreement, which allows a member of the class to move for\nrelief in the district court in the event that the DPI should refuse to appoint counsel for a class member in a due\nprocess hearing. The district court denied McClain's application, noting that he never sought appointment, nor\nwas he ever appointed by that court under the consent decree.\nII.\nMcClain now argues that the court erred by not granting the fees under New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey,\n447 U.S. 54, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980). There the Supreme Court held that under Title VII, a federal\ncourt may allow the prevailing party attorney fees for legal services performed in prosecuting an employment\ndiscrimination claim in state administrative and judicial proceedings that Title VII requires federal claimants to\n\ninvoke. The Court in Gaslight Club relied heavily on requirements under Title VII and EEOC regulations which\nmandate an initial resort to agencies authorized by state and local governments to grant relief, before recourse to\nfederal forums is proper. 447 U.S. at 62-63, 100 S.Ct. at 2030. The Court reasoned that if Congress included\nadministrative proceedings as a necessary element of the Title VII enforcement scheme, it must also have\nintended the attorney fees provision of Title VII to authorize an award of fees to plaintiffs who do not need to file a\ncivil complaint on the merits of their Title VII claim because they have substantially prevailed in an administrative\nproceeding.\nMcClain submits that 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 supplies the statutory authority for attorney fees in this case. The relevant\npart of section 1988 provides:\nIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986\nof this title, title IX of Public Law 92-318, or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court, in its\ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's\nfee as part of the costs.\nMcClain urges this court to extend the Gaslight Club rationale to cases falling under section 1988. He argues that\nthe language \"any action or proceeding\" is sufficiently broad to cover the state administrative proceeding in which\nhe participated. McClain's reliance on Gaslight Club is misplaced. Although the language of section 706(k) of Title\nVII and section 1988 are similar, the Gaslight Club rationale is not controlling here. The reason is that unlike Title\nVII \"no Congressional policy exists under * * * any of the civil rights statutes enumerated in ยง 1988, which\nmandates that civil rights claimants initiate their actions at the state level before an action in federal court is\nproper.\" Derheim v. Hennepin County Bureau of Social Services, 524 F.Supp. 1321, 1324 (D.Minn.1981),aff'd on\nother grounds,688 F.2d 66 (8th Cir.1982).\nFurthermore, section 1988 itself does not create an independent right of action to recover attorney fees.\nIn Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 98 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), a case\ndecided prior to the 1976 amendment which added the attorneys' fees provision to section 1988,\nthe Supreme Court ruled that section 1988 does not create a right of action. Its function is to\nauthorize remedies for violations of the other civil rights statutes.3 The language of the 1976\namendment adding the attorney's fees provision gives no basis for deviating from the conclusion\nreached in Moor v. County of Alameda. The provision allows recovery of attorney's fees \"as a part\nof the costs\" awarded \"[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce [a provision of the] Civil Rights Act\nof 1964.\" By its terms, it does not contemplate an independent action solely to recover attorney's\n500 fees. Moreover, the legislative history *500 makes it clear that the attorney's fees provision is part\nof the remedy only.\nThe purpose and effect of S. 2278 are simple 00 it is designed to allow courts to provide the\n97\nfamiliar remedy of reasonable counsel fees to prevailing parties in suits to enforce the civil rights\nacts which Congress has passed since 1866.\nS.Rep. No. 94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1976), reprinted in [1976] U.S.Code Cong. &\nAd.News 5908, 5909-10 (emphasis added).\n3 This holding was reaffirmed after the 1976 amendment to Monell v. Department of Social\nServices, 436 U.S. 658, 701 [98 S.Ct. 2018, 2041, 56 L.Ed.2d 611] n. 66.\n524 F.Supp. at 1325.\nThe Third Circuit very recently addressed similar contentions in Latino Project, Inc. v. City of Camden, 701 F.2d\n262 (3d Cir.1983). The issue before the court in Latino Project was whether, in addition to civil lawsuits, section\n1988 authorizes an award of attorney fees to plaintiffs who substantially prevail in administrative proceedings\nwithout filing a civil complaint on the merits. Using the same rationale as the district court in the instant case, the\nThird Circuit held:\n\nDespite the literal ambiguity of the words \"civil action or proceeding,\" the statutory context of those\nwords indicates that Congress intended section 1988 to authorize an award of attorney's fees only\nto a party who substantially prevails on a civil rights claim in a lawsuit.\nId. at 264. That court also declined to expand the rationale of Gaslight Club to include section 1988.\nThe provision of the consent decree requiring appointment of counsel to represent the mentally retarded class\nmembers in the due process hearings does not provide for compensation for appointment of counsel, and there\nis no other statutory basis for recovery of fees in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n[1] The Honorable Albert G. Schatz, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "357 F.Supp. 71 (1973)\nSarah Ann HORACEK et al., Plaintiffs,\nv.\nJames J. EXON et al., Defendants.\nNo. CV72-L-299.\nUnited States District Court, D. Nebraska.\nMarch 22, 1973.\n72 *72 Bruce G. Mason, Omaha, Neb., for plaintiffs.\nMel Kammerlohr, Asst. Atty. Gen., Lincoln, Neb., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS\nURBOM, Chief Judge.\nThis matter is before the court on the defendants' motion to dismiss, filing No. 4.\nThe plaintiffs, represented through their parents, have brought a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983,\non behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated, alleging that the physical conditions, care,\ntreatment and training provided by the defendants at the Beatrice State Home for the mentally retarded do not\nmeet constitutional standards. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that they have not received a constitutionally\nminimal level of habilitation; that their commitment to the Beatrice State Home has deprived them of due process,\nin that less restrictive community alternatives are available which would provide them adequate care, treatment,\neducation and training with far less restrictions upon personal liberty and the exercise of constitutional rights; that\nthey are being denied equal protection of the law by unreasonable classifications which deny them rights and\nbenefits which others similarly situated have; and that certain practices by the defendants constitute a form of\ninvoluntary servitude and cruel and unusual punishment. The plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1651, 2201 and 2202, and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\nThe defendants' motion to dismiss is bottomed on the assertion that the complaint fails to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted; that the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter, since the complaint fails to\nraise a substantial federal question; and that the complaint fails to present any justiciable issue which could\nappropriately be adjudicated by this court.\n73 The question facing this court is whether on the facts alleged in the *73 plaintiffs' complaint a claim for relief has\nbeen presented which is cognizable for review under the Civil Rights Act. The defendants maintain that no\nfederally protected right has been denied the plaintiffs, because there is no constitutional requirement that the\nstate provide the plaintiffs with habilitative treatment at the Beatrice State Home. Moreover, the defendants assert\nthat whether a state shall provide a particular governmental service, and the quality and quantity of that service,\nare questions of state, rather than federal, constitutional law.\nFor purposes of evaluating the defendants' motion, this court must determine whether the plaintiffs could prove\nno set of facts in support of their claim which would entitle them to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46,\n78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); cf. Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 521, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).\nTaking the allegations as true for purposes of this motion, I am convinced that the plaintiffs have stated at least\none claim which is cognizable for review under the Civil Rights Act. The allegations that the conditions of\nconfinement at the Beatrice State Home are violative of the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual\npunishment would appear to fall within the purview of the Civil Rights Act. It must be noted that the ban on cruel\nand unusual punishment applies not only to sentences imposed in judicial proceedings, but to conditions of\nconfinement as well. See, Sawyer v. Sigler, 320 F.Supp. 690 (U.S.D.C.Neb.1970), aff'd, 445 F.2d 818 (C.A. 8th\n\nCir. 1971); Lollis v. New York State Department of Social Services, 322 F.Supp. 473 (U.S.D.C.S.D.N.Y.1970). I\ncannot say as a matter of law at this stage of the litigation that the plaintiffs will be unable to muster facts in\nsupport of their claims that the conditions at the Beatrice State Home are cruel and unusual. At the very least, the\nplaintiffs should be given an opportunity to offer evidence on this allegation.\nWith respect to the other allegations of the plaintiffs, it is clear that serious question has been raised by federal\ncourts in other jurisdictions concerning the applicability of the Civil Rights Act in redressing grievances of persons\nconfined, either voluntarily or involuntarily, in state institutions for the mentally retarded. See, Wyatt v. Stickney,\n325 F.Supp. 781 (U.S.D.C.M.D.Ala.1971); Wyatt v. Stickney, 334 F.Supp. 1341 (U.S.D.C.M.D.Ala.1971); \nBurnham v. Department of Public Health of the State of Georgia, 349 F.Supp. 1335 (U. S.D.C.M.D.Ga.1972); cf. \nMartarella v. Kelley, 349 F.Supp. 575 (U.S.D.C.S.D. N.Y.1972); note, Rouse v. Cameron, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 366,\n373 F.2d 451 (C.A.D. C.1966) (habeas corpus action relating to selected provisions of the D.C.Code, 1961); and\n\"The Mentally Ill and the Right to Treatment,\" 36 Chi.L.Rev. 742 (1969). Recent decisions in this area indicate\nthat courts differ on the question of whether there is a constitutional right for persons to be given habilitative\ntreatment at state institutions for the mentally retarded, and whether due process, equal protection, or the Eighth\nAmendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment entitle such persons to bring their allegations under the Civil\nRights Act. Needless to say, the issues presented herein are of a sensitive nature, both as to their legal and\nmoral overtones, but this memorandum is not fashioned to deal with the possible ramifications of the plaintiffs'\ntheories, since it is enough to say that they should be given an opportunity to present evidence.\nAs to the matter of the justiciability of the plaintiffs' allegations, it appears that the defendants question whether\nthis court could render with any specificity an order which would resolve the controversy. The Wyatt case, supra,\nindicates that at least one federal district court judge has taken the view that affirmative and corrective orders can\n74 be fashioned in a dispute of this nature. While I in no way suggest that *74 this court would take the same\napproach, I am confident that this court could render an order prohibiting certain conduct at the Beatrice State\nHome if that conduct is shown to be in violation of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs. The defendants further\nimply in their brief that the case presents purely political considerations, in that the state is the sole judge of the\nquality of its public services and whether to provide such services at all. While there is certainly public policy\ninvolved in a dispute of this nature, I also find that the allegations in the complaint, especially those dealing with\ncruel and unusual punishment, present questions of federal law. I am not convinced that the case presents\npolitical questions only or that constitutional questions are absent. Another aspect of justiciability, that dealing\nwith whether the case presents a case or controversy, has not been briefed by the defendants and deserves little\nmention here since it clearly appears that the plaintiffs have not presented this court with an abstract set of\nhypothetical facts. Instead, there appears to be a concrete dispute between the parties relating to the care and\ntreatment given at the Beatrice State Home. Accordingly, I conclude that the issues presented by the plaintiffs are\njusticiable.\nThe court has raised one further issue which must be resolved before the case can continue. The parents of\ncertain children residing at the Beatrice State Home have brought this action on behalf of their children. The\nquestion now is whether the parents of the named plaintiff's are the proper parties to represent the interests of\nthe named plaintiffs. I cannot be insensitive to the possibility that the interests of the parents may conflict with\nthose of the children residing at the Beatrice State Home. While the parents in all good conscience may desire\none remedy, or a specific type or style of treatment for their children, it would not necessarily be in the best\ninterests of the children. Therefore, it seems to me that a discreet course would be to provide for the appointment\nof a guardian ad litem, who would not displace the parents as representatives of the plaintiffs but would be alert\nto recognize potential and actual differences in positions asserted by the parents and positions that need to be\nasserted on behalf of the plaintiffs. Accordingly, an order shortly will be entered, making the appointment under\nRule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nIt hereby is ordered:\n1. That the defendants' motion to dismiss, filing No. 4, is denied; and\n2. That the motion to intervene as amicus curiae, filed by the National Center for Law and the Handicapped, filing\nNo. 9, is granted.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
