Introduction \n20  1.  This lawsuit against Washington state officials is about whether a minor child who \n21  is receiving or even just seeking so-called “gender-affirming” treatment—which includes services \n22  that alter body parts, prescribe life-altering medications, and other related things—showing up at \n23  a youth shelter, homeless shelter, or a host home, provides sufficient grounds to steamroll parental \n24  constitutional rights. Under recently enacted SB 5599, that answer is “yes.” Under the United \n25  States Constitution and the Washington State Constitution, however, that answer is “no.”  \n26  2.  This lawsuit challenges Engrossed Senate Substitute Bill (SB) 5599 of the 2023 \n27  Regular Session of the 68th Legislature of Washington State, which is codified in relevant part at \n \nComplaint - 1  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 2 of 35\n \n1  Revised Code of Washington (Wash. Rev. Code.) § 13.32A.082(3), and took effect July 23, 2023. \n2  The statute infringes on parental constitutional rights. \n3  3.  It takes away a requirement of notice to parents.  \n4  4.  It authorizes the State to refer a minor for “behavioral health services” without \n5  defining what that entails, potentially meaning that a minor could receive—at least—mental health \n6  services that the parents would not endorse, and arguably also medical treatment that the parents \n7  would not authorize. There is no age minimum in SB 5599 for such services. \n8  5.  SB 5599 also delays when parents can get their children back from the State’s \n9  control. \n10  6.  In short, this statute allows shelters and homes to keep children at locations without \n11  their parents’ knowledge and refer those children for health interventions without their parents’ \n12  knowledge or approval. It does not require children to be returned on any particular timetable or \n13  under any particular conditions.  \n14  7.  This suit is thus brought as a pre-enforcement challenge against statewide officials, \n15  in their official capacities, over this new Washington statute that discriminatorily deprives certain \n16  parents—but not all parents—of their fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution to direct the \n17  care and upbringing of their children, as well as their rights to the free exercise of religion, due \n18  process, free speech, and equal protection. Plaintiffs bring this suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n19  because Defendants are acting under color of state law in violating Plaintiffs’ rights under the First \n20  and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  \n21  II.  Parties.  \n22  8.  Plaintiff International Partners for Ethical Care, Inc., is a nonprofit organization \n23  incorporated in the State of Illinois and recognized as a charitable or educational public benefit \n24  organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Parent 1A is a citizen of Washington and the mother of a 14-year-old biological girl \n9  who previously identified as a boy, whom we will call 1C.  \n10  11.  Parent  1B  is  the  husband  of  Parent  1A  and  father  of  1C.  He  is  a  citizen  of \n11  Washington.  \n12  12.  The prior gender transition of 1C took place at school, unbeknownst to her parents, \n13  where the school encouraged the transition, including through meeting for two and a half months \n14  with a school counselor. 1C, after being removed from public school, de-transitioned and now again \n15  identifies as a girl. But 1A and 1B believe that when they put 1C back in school this fall, through the \n16  school’s efforts which the school kept hidden from 1A and 1B, 1C will transition again and run away \n17  from home. \n18  13.  Parent 2A is the mother of two transgender children: 2C, a biological girl who \n19  identifies as a boy and recently turned age 18, and 2D, another biological girl who identifies as a \n20  boy, is age 13. 2A is a citizen of Washington.  \n21  14.  Parent 2B is the husband of Parent 2A, the father of 2C and 2D, and a citizen of \n22  Washington.  \n23  15.  Parent 3A is the mother of a transgender child, 3C, a 14-year-old biological boy who \n24  identifies as a girl. 3C is also autistic. 3A is a citizen of Washington.  \n25  16.  Parent 3B is the husband of Parent 3A and the father of 3C. He is a citizen of \n26  Washington.  \n27 \n \nComplaint - 3  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O.

They believe in the teachings of the Roman Catholic \n2  Church on gender transitions and identity.  \n3  18.  Parent 4A is the mother of three children, including 4C, who is an eight-year-old \n4  girl, and 4D, a six-year-old boy. 4A is a citizen of Washington.  \n5  19.  Parent 4B is the husband of 4A and the father of 4C and 4D. He is a citizen of \n6  Washington.  \n7  20.  4A and 4B are non-denominational Christians who believe the Bible is the Word of \n8  God and, as such, is authoritative on every issue to which it speaks. They believe the topics on \n9  which the Bible provides teachings include gender transitions and identity.  \n10  21.  Defendant Jay Inslee is the Governor of the State of Washington. As such, he must \n11  enforce the laws of that state. See Wash. Const. art. III, § 5. Governor Inslee also supervises the \n12  Department Secretary who administers SB 5599, and the Governor has the authority to remove \n13  the Secretary, as discussed below.  \n14  22.  Governor Inslee signed SB 5599 on May 9, 2023.  \n15  23.  Governor Inslee is sued in his official capacity.  \n16  24.  Defendant Robert Ferguson is the Attorney General of Washington. As such, he is \n17  responsible for the legal defense of state statutes, including SB 5599. See Wash. Const. art. III, § 1; \n18  Wash. Rev. Code § 43.10.030.  \n19  25.  Attorney General Ferguson is sued in his official capacity.  \n20  26.  SB 5599 is administered by the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, \n21  and Families (“the Department” or “DCYF”).  \n22  27.  The Department is an agency in the executive branch of the State of Washington. \n23  Wash. Rev. Code § 43.216.015.  \n24  28.  Defendant Ross  Hunter is  Secretary  of the Washington State Department  of \n25  Children, Youth, and Families.  \n26 \n27 \n \nComplaint - 4  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v.

Secretary Hunter “has the complete charge and supervisory powers over the \n2  department.” Wash. Rev. Code § 43.216.025; see also Matter of W.W.S., 469 P.3d 1190, 1204 \n3  (Wash. Ct. App. 2020) (outlining the Secretary’s vast authority over the Department).  \n4  30.  Secretary Hunter has authority over the Assistant Secretaries who issued the SB \n5  5599 implementation Memo discussed below.  \n6  31.  Secretary Hunter was appointed by Governor Inslee, with the consent of the \n7  Washington State Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor. See Wash. Rev. Code § \n8  43.216.025.  \n9  32.  Secretary Hunter is sued in his official capacity.  \n10  III.  Jurisdiction and Venue.  \n11  33.  This case presents federal questions arising under the Constitution of the United \n12  States and also seeks relief for the deprivation of federal rights under color of state law. This Court \n13  accordingly has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343. \n14  34.  This Court has authority to award Plaintiffs declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n15  § 2201, and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 2202, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. \n16  35.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  District  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b)  because  a \n17  substantial part of the facts complained of herein occurred within this District and because this \n18  District is the seat of government of the State of Washington and therefore Defendants are \n19  domiciled in this District.  \n20  IV.  Facts.  \n21  A.  Statutory Scheme.  \n22  36.  During its most recent session, the Washington State Legislature enacted two \n23  statutes that amended Wash. Rev. Code § 13.32A.082. See 2023 Wash. Legis. Serv. Ch. 151 (SHB \n24  1406); 2023 Wash. Legis. Serv. Ch. 408 (ESSB 5599). Both acts went into effect on July 23, 2023. \n25  37.  SB 5599 modified the rights and procedures of Washington state law concerning \n26  parents in the upbringing and custody of their children.  \n27 \n \nComplaint - 5  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 6 of 35\n \n1  38.  In Washington, the baseline rule governing parental rights when children go to a \n2  shelter is that when a shelter “knows at the time of providing the shelter that the child is away from \n3  a lawfully prescribed residence or home without parental permission, it must contact the youth’s \n4  parent within 72 hours, but preferably within 24 hours, following the time that the youth is \n5  admitted  to  the  shelter  or  other  licensed  organization’s  program.”  Wash.  Rev.  Code  § \n6  13.32A.082(1)(b)(i). Further, that “notification must include the whereabouts of the youth, a \n7  description of the youth’s physical and emotional condition, and the circumstances surrounding \n8  the youth’s contact with the shelter or organization.” Id. \n9  39.  Thus, under this baseline rule, no later than 72 hours after a minor shows up at a \n10  shelter, parents must be told exactly where the child is, as well as how the child is and how the child \n11  ended up at the shelter, and the parents are free to go pick up their child and take him or her home. \n12  40.  The only exception to this statutorily imposed duty of shelters is that “[i]f there are \n13  compelling reasons not to notify the parent, the shelter or organization must instead notify the \n14  department”—that is, the state Department of Children, Youth and Families. Id. (emphasis \n15  added). Additionally, “compelling reasons” were previously defined as “circumstances that \n16  indicate that notifying the parent or legal guardian will subject the minor to abuse or neglect as \n17  defined in [another code section].” Id. § 13.32A.082(2)(c). \n18  41.  But SB 5599 expanded the definition of “compelling reasons” to now also include \n19  “[w]hen a minor is seeking or receiving protected health care services.” Id. § 13.32A.082(2)(c)(ii). \n20  And “‘protected health care services’ means “gender affirming treatment” as defined in [another \n21  code section].” Id. § 13.32A.082(2)(d). \n22  42.  In other words, to determine whether the exception to the baseline rule applies, \n23  there is no longer an inquiry into traditional abuse or neglect but merely a categorical triggering of \n24  “compelling reasons” whenever a minor shows up at a shelter seeking certain health services. Put \n25  another way, under SB 5599, a child merely showing up at a shelter or host home seeking or \n26  receiving “gender-affirming” treatment is legally equivalent to “circumstances that indicate” \n27  abuse or neglect. \n \nComplaint - 6  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 7 of 35\n \n1  43.  Children run away for a host of reasons, including much less serious ones, such as: \n2  •  “birth of a new baby in the family;” \n3  •  “family financial worries;” \n4  •  “problems at school;” \n5  •  “peer pressure;” \n6  •  “failing or dropping out of school;” \n7  •  “death in the family;” \n8  •  “parents separating or divorcing or the arrival of a new stepparent;” \n9  •  “kids . . . drinking alcohol or taking drugs,” \n10  Running  Away,  Nemours  KidsHealth  (June  2018),  https://tinyurl.com/5n6vjpev  (medically \n11  reviewed by Steven Dowshen, MD).  \n12  44.  Additionally, SB 5599, along with SHB 1406, another new statute that went into \n13  effect at the same time, modifies a related provision, Wash. Rev. Code § 13.32A.082(3), to facilitate \n14  potentially life-changing medical treatments for the child, without first providing adequate parental \n15  notice or receiving parental consent. As modified, the latter provision now reads as follows, with \n16  the SB 5599 amended provisions bolded and the SHB 1406 amended provisions italicized:  \n17  (3) (a) When the department receives a report under subsection (1) of this section, it \nshall make a good faith attempt to notify the parent that a report has been received and \n18  offer services to the youth and the family designed to resolve the conflict, including \noffering family reconciliation services, and accomplish a reunification of the family. The \n19  department shall offer services under this subsection as soon as possible, but no later \nthan three days, excluding weekends and holidays, following the receipt of a report \n20  under subsection (1) of this section.  \n21  (b) When the department receives a report under subsection (1) of this section for a \nminor who is seeking or receiving protected health care services, it shall:  \n22 \n(i) Offer to make referrals on behalf of the minor for appropriate behavioral health \n23  services; and  \n24  (ii) Offer services designed to resolve the conflict and accomplish a reunification of the \nfamily. \n25 \nWash. Rev. Code § 13.32A.082(3).  \n26 \n27 \n \nComplaint - 7  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O.

These amendments appear to exempt from the usual parental notice requirement a \n3  scenario in which a minor is seeking or receiving protected health care services, since the action \n4  required in that specific scenario is covered by Subsection 3(b), which does not refer to parental \n5  notification. That conclusion is reinforced by the “commonplace” rule “of statutory construction \n6  that the specific governs the general.” City & Cnty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1239 (9th Cir. \n7  2018) (quoting RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012)).  \n8  46.  Additionally, reading Subsection 3(a), which applies to scenarios where there are \n9  compelling reasons not to notify parents, as simultaneously applying alongside Subsection 3(b), \n10  which specifies the subset of compelling reasons in which minors are seeking or receiving protected \n11  health services, would make 3(b)(ii) surplusage, since nearly the same thing is said in 3(a). Such \n12  interpretation would violate the fundamental rule of statutory interpretation that a court must “if \n13  possible . . . give effect to each word and clause in a statute.” United States v. Lopez, 998 F.3d 431, \n14  440 (9th Cir. 2021). Thus, a fair reading of the new statutory provision would authorize potentially \n15  life-changing medical treatments before notification to parents.  \n16  47.  Additionally, when statutory language is unclear, conflicting, or silent, Washington \n17  state courts resort to legislative history. See Gorre v. City of Tacoma, 357 P.3d 625, 631 (Wash. 2015) \n18  (“We must therefore resort to other aids of statutory interpretation to resolve th[e] [statutory] \n19  ambiguity. And one of those aids—legislative history—ends our analysis.” (citation omitted)); see \n20  also In re Marriage of Kovacs, 854 P.2d 629, 634 (Wash. 1993) (“[I]n determining the legislative \n21  purpose and intent the court may look beyond the language of the Act to legislative history.”). \n22  48.  The legislative history strongly indicates that the Washington State Legislature \n23  intended to deprive parents of their ordinary parental rights when their child presents at a shelter \n24  receiving or seeking “gender-affirming” treatment. As legal counsel for the Committee explained, \n25  “Under this bill, they [i.e., personnel at a shelter or from the Department] do not need to contact \n26  the parent if a compelling reason exists—which includes but is not limited to notifying the parent \n27  will subject the minor to child abuse and neglect or the minor is seeking protected health care \n \nComplaint - 8  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v.

Remarkably, under the text and legislative history of SB 5599, it appears that \n5  parents of children with circumstances indicating that notifying the parent or legal guardian will \n6  subject the child to abuse or neglect will still receive notification from the Department regarding \n7  their child. In contrast, the parents of children without such circumstances who seek or receive \n8  protected health services will not receive notification. \n9  50.  Nevertheless, Secretary Ross’s subordinates insist that SB 5599 would not operate \n10  entirely in this manner, despite the statements above and below from the statute’s sponsors and \n11  legislative supporters.  \n12  51.  Natalie Green is Assistant Secretary of Child Welfare Field Operations at the \n13  Department, and Steve Grilli is Assistant Secretary of Partnership, Prevention, and Services at the \n14  Department.

On July 21, 2023, Green and Grilli issued a Policy Memo in which they claimed that, \n17  in implementing SB 5599 regarding a homeless youth seeking “gender-affirming” treatment, a \n18  caseworker must “[m]ake a good faith attempt to contact the youth’s parent or legal guardian to \n19  offer FRS [i.e., family reconciliation services] to resolve the conflict and accomplish a reunification \n20  of the family.” Natalie Green & Steve Grilli, Policy Memo: Changes to 3100, Family Reconciliation \n21  Services  Policy,  Wash.

(emphasis added). Should the child not provide such contact \n2  information, the Memo indicates that no notification will be provided to the parents. \n3  54.  The Memo provides no explanation for why the lawmakers quoted below who \n4  wrote, sponsored, and supported SB 5599, as well as the lawmakers quoted below who opposed the \n5  bill, were all of one mind regarding the bill’s effect of denying parents notification when their \n6  children are seeking or receiving protected health services. Nor does the Memo explain away the \n7  clear meaning of the bill’s words, which contradict the Memo. \n8  C.  Timing of Notice.  \n9  55.  Even if one reads the statute to violate general-specific and anti-surplusage canons \n10  such that Subsection 3(a) also applies to everyone under Subsection 3(b), SB 5599 still changes the \n11  timing of the notice to parents in a way that substantially impairs parental rights. Before SB 5599’s \n12  amendments, a parent of a child receiving “gender-affirming” treatment who showed up at a \n13  shelter  without  providing  personnel  any  reason  to  suspect  abuse  or  neglect  would  receive \n14  notification within 72 hours. See Wash. Rev. Code § 13.32A.082(1)(b)(i). \n15  56.  But now, under the revised Subsection 3(a), assuming it even applies to these \n16  parents, the Department does not have to provide parental notification until three business days \n17  after they receive a report from the shelter. And the shelter does not have to provide a report to \n18  the Department until 72 hours have elapsed (if there is even any time requirement at all in a \n19  compelling reasons scenario—the statute is not clear). \n20  57.  Thus, SB 5599 and SHB 1406 change the notification time from 72 hours to as many \n21  as nine days if a three-day weekend interrupts the three-business-day clock. Nearly an additional \n22  week without notification can be an eternity for parents whose child is missing. \n23  D.  Content of Notice.  \n24  58.  Next, assuming Subsection 3(a) applies to parents with minors seeking or receiving \n25  protected health services, the statutory changes also alter the level of detail that must be provided \n26  to parents. Ordinarily, without compelling reasons, the shelter must provide the child’s location, \n27 \n \nComplaint - 10  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O.

See  Wash.  Rev.  Code  § \n2  13.32A.082(1)(b)(i).  \n3  59.  But under revised Subsection 3(a), all the Department must provide in its notice \n4  about the child is that it received a report from a shelter. Nothing requires the Department to \n5  provide the location, condition, or circumstances. Thus, parents will not know where their child is \n6  or how he or she is doing, and without the former, they cannot go and get the child. So this change \n7  in the law deprives certain parents—for whom there is no suspicion of neglect or abuse—of crucial \n8  knowledge about their child and the ability to get their child from the shelter. \n9  E.  Treatment for Child.  \n10  60.  The changes by SB 5599 also remove from parental control choices about treatment \n11  for a child under Paragraph 3(b)(i). This provision now enables the Department to “[o]ffer to make \n12  referrals  on  behalf  of  the  minor  for  appropriate  behavioral  health  services.”  Nowhere  is \n13  “appropriate behavioral health services” defined in the statute or elsewhere in Washington state \n14  law. And so, statutory silence requires a resort to legislative history.  \n15  61.  Washington State Senator Marko Liis, a sponsor of SB 5599, explained during a \n16  legislative hearing on his bill: \n17  What this bill speaks to is when a young person is seeking certain essential health care \nservices, … to make critical decisions about their future or seeking gender-affirming care \n18  in the face of opposition and hostility from their family. In those cases where that \nreunification process would separate that vulnerable young person from the health care \n19  that they’re entitled to… When a family is standing between their young person and \nessential health care services there, and we need to focus on the essential needs of the \n20  young person. In short, they’re getting the care they deserve.  \n21  Senate Floor Debate on SB 5599 (Mar. 1, 2023) (statement of Sen. Marko Liias, Sponsor, at \n22  1:24:48–1:26:00) (emphasis added), available at https://tinyurl.com/75jaep4t.  \n23  62.  In sum, SB 5599 allows the Department to stand in the place of parents and \n24  authorize potentially life-altering (and even sterilizing) “gender-affirming” treatment and mental \n25  therapy services for minors when they show up at a shelter or host home seeking or claiming to \n26  have received protected health services. And SB 5599 allows the Department to do that even in the \n27  face of disagreement or opposition from the parents. \n \nComplaint - 11  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O.

Finally, SB 5599 significantly delays the return of a child back to their parents. That \n3  is not only because parents will not know their child’s location so they can pick the child up, but \n4  also because nothing in these statutory changes requires the Department to return the child, and \n5  certainly not on any specific timeline. All that Paragraph 3(b)(ii) does is require the Department to \n6  “[o]ffer services designed to resolve the conflict and accomplish reunification of the family.” But, \n7  until that conflict is resolved—to whose satisfaction the statute does not say, but likely, to the \n8  Department’s—reunification will not be required, meaning the Department will be under no \n9  mandate to return the child. \n10  64.  Here again, the legislative history supports this reading of the statutory text. \n11  Sponsor Sen. Liias said the law is for “those cases where that reunification process would separate \n12  that vulnerable young person from the health care that they’re entitled to . . . . When a family is \n13  standing between their young person and essential health care services there, and we need to focus \n14  on the essential needs of the young person. In short, they’re getting the care they deserve. And \n15  then focus on the important reunification process.” Senate Floor Debate on SB 5599 (Mar. 1, 2023) \n16  (statement  of  Sen.  Marko  Liias,  Sponsor,  at  1:24:48–1:26:00).  In  other  words,  when  the \n17  Department can provide the services it thinks the child needs without parental consent, it will \n18  attempt reunification at some point following those services. But the statute is silent about what \n19  triggers reunification and when that would occur. And that silence creates a serious additional risk \n20  that parental rights will be impaired.  \n21  65.  Here again, the legislative history indicates that is exactly what the proponents of \n22  SB  559  intended.  During  the  legislative  debates,  proponents  of  the  bill  frequently  framed \n23  recalcitrant parents as the problem SB 5599 was designed to solve. On the Senate floor, for \n24  example, Sponsor Sen. Marko Liias referred to the “opposition and hostility from their family” \n25  children seeking these services would face and how “a family is standing between their young \n26  person and essential health care services.” Senate Floor Debate on SB 5599 (Mar. 1, 2023) \n27  (statement of Sen.

Never mind that \n4  some  of  these  services  have  potentially  life-altering,  negative  consequences  for  the  child—\n5  including, in some cases, sterilization.  \n6  66.  On the floor of the Washington State House, Representative Jamila Taylor likewise \n7  described the purpose of the bill as saving kids from their parents: \n8  “I just want to remind you, Mr. Speaker, that we’re talking about children who are not \nin  this  room  hearing  really  encouraging  language  from  their  parents.  It’s  the \n9  combination, the tone, the tenor, the threats, the isolation, the words that are constantly \ntold you cannot be uniquely you. You cannot be something other than what I desire for \n10  you to be. And if you do not follow my rules, you cannot be here. If you want to follow \nmy rules, I’m not even gonna give you the safety, the comfort that you so desire when \n11  you want  to  be uniquely  you. Mr.  Speaker, the microaggressions, the language a \nparent—I really wish more parents had the skills that the parents were in this room \n12  talking about how they would want to affirm their children, but say no. I wish more \nparents had that. But I see a young person come to me on a regular basis saying I can’t \n13  go home. Home is not safe. … I tell you there are some unhealthy family dynamics out \nthere and that child, that child wants to go home, wants to see the love from their \n14  parents. They need some way to communicate better with their parent. Their parent \nneeds another way to speak to this child, to get them through the toughest parts part of \n15  their life. We must step in. We must provide a place for this child.” \n16  House Floor Debate on SB 5599 (Apr. 12, 2023) (statement of Rep. Jamila Taylor, Representative, \n17  at 1:42:32–1:44:55), available at https://tinyurl.com/4wdbhape. \n18  67.  Senator Yasmin Trudeau similarly declared:  \n19  “And what ends up driving, you know, that the driving force often, especially for, for \nour trans youth is the lack of acceptance. And we know the statistics when it comes to \n20  suicide, when it comes to, you know, homelessness, when it comes to other issues that \ndisproportionately impact trans youth. It is a result of rejection by their family, by the \n21  lack of love and support that’s shown. And so I think that we all have, we would love to \nknow that every family is a family that supports their children. But Mr. President, that \n22  just isn’t the case . . . . So I just say, yes, for those of us that, that have the means and \nthe resources and the ability to love: wonderful. Many families don’t. And for the kids \n23  that come from those families, they deserve the support and love as well as support this \nbill.” \n24 \nSenate Floor Debate on SB 5599 (Mar. 1, 2023) (statement of Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, at 1:55:00–\n25 \n1:57:00). \n26 \n27 \n \nComplaint - 13  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 14 of 35\n \n1  68.  Of course, nothing in the statute requires any finding that the parents kicked the \n2  child out of the home or in any other way neglected or abused their child to trigger the various \n3  constitutional infringements to parents SB 5599 authorizes. In the eyes of these legislators, the \n4  parents’ “sin” need be nothing more than the parents’ desire to allow their child to mature before \n5  making permanent life-altering decisions about whether the child will ever be capable of becoming \n6  a biological parent.  \n7  69.  In sum, because of SB 5599, where there is no indication of past or future abuse or \n8  neglect, parents are treated differently under the law depending on whether their minor children, \n9  when showing up to a shelter, are seeking or receiving “gender-affirming” treatment. Under those \n10  two circumstances—but only those two circumstances—the parents of that minor are treated \n11  differently than other parents.  \n12  70.  Under those two circumstances—but only those two circumstances—there is no \n13  process or procedure for determining if parents should be notified of the location and well-being of \n14  their children or instead denied control over the treatment of their child and denied having their \n15  child at home for a longer, indefinite period. The absence of such a process or procedure is a serious \n16  deprivation of a parent’s constitutional rights. \n17  G.  Religious Beliefs of Some Plaintiffs.  \n18  71.  SB 5599 also interferes with the ability of some parents to comply with their \n19  religious beliefs on matters of “gender-affirming” care.  \n20  72.  For  example,  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  teaches  that  a  human  body  is \n21  intentionally and purposefully created by God as either male or female.  \n22  73.  As embraced by Parents 3A and 3B, the Roman Catholic Church teaches:  \n23  Everyone,  man  and  woman,  should  acknowledge  and  accept  his  sexual  identity. \nPhysical, moral, and spiritual difference and complementarity are oriented toward the \n24  goods of marriage and the flourishing of family life. The harmony of the couple and of \nsociety depends in part on the way in which the complementarity, needs, and mutual \n25  support between the sexes are lived out.  \n26  Catechism of the Catholic Church para. 2333, available at https://tinyurl.com/rwsdv27e (last visited \n27  Aug. 16, 2023).  \n \nComplaint - 14  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 15 of 35\n \n1  74.  Those Plaintiffs additionally adhere to the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, \n2  when it teaches, “By creating the human being man and woman, God gives personal dignity to the \n3  one and the other. Each of them, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual \n4  identity.” Catechism of the Catholic Church para. 2393.  \n5  75.  As to the religious faith of Parents 4A and 4B, whose beliefs on these issues are \n6  informed by the Bible as they understand it, they know the Bible to teach that man and woman are \n7  created by God as male or female, respectively, see Genesis 1:27 (“So God created man in his own \n8  image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.”), that sexual activity \n9  is to be confined to a marriage relationship of a person of the opposite biological sex, see Leviticus \n10  18:22 (“You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination”), and that biological \n11  males and females are not to embrace gender expressions in their manner of dress that reflects \n12  society’s expression of the opposite biological sex, see 1 Corinthians 11:14–15 (discussing manners \n13  of dress associated with men and distinct from those associated with women). \n14  76.  Parents 3A and 3B believe that their faith places upon them a religious obligation to \n15  teach these religious beliefs to their children and guide them in living them. As the Catechism \n16  teaches, “Through the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents receive the responsibility \n17  privilege of evangelizing their children. Parents should initiate their children at an early age not the \n18  mysteries of the faith of which they are the ‘first heralds’ of their children. They should associate \n19  them from their tenderest years with the life of the Church . . . .” Catechism of the Catholic Church \n20  para. 2225, available at https://tinyurl.com/5t328kwa (last visited Aug. 16, 2023). \n21  77.  Parents 4A and 4B likewise hold this belief, as they believe God commands them to \n22  do so in the Bible. See, e.g., Deuteronomy 6:6–7 (“And these words that I command you today shall \n23  be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you \n24  sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.”); \n25  Ephesians 6:4 (“Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline \n26  and instruction of the Lord.”); 2 Timothy 3:16–17 (“All Scripture is breathed out by God and \n27 \n \nComplaint - 15  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v.

SB5599 Interferes with First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights.  \n4  78.  Notwithstanding parents’ constitutional rights to direct the upbringing of their \n5  children, with SB 5599, children of any age under seeking “gender-affirming” treatment can do so \n6  through the Department if that child is in a homeless shelter or host home. \n7  79.  Guidelines  from  the  World  Professional  Association  of  Transgender  Health \n8  (WPATH) recommends no age restrictions for transition therapy. Children as young as 8 have \n9  received puberty blockers and opposite-sex hormones, and girls as young as 12 have received \n10  mastectomies. \n11  80.  Moreover, as the bill’s proponents made clear in the legislative history, SB 5599 \n12  penalizes parents of transgender children who both use the pronouns that correspond to the \n13  children’s biological sex and refuse to use those children’s preferred pronouns or name. By \n14  penalizing parents’ refusal to engage in “gendering-affirming” speech and speaking contrary to it, \n15  SB 5599 equates such speech and refusal to speak with child abuse. \n16  81.  Governor Inslee appears to agree. He has declared regarding SB 5599, “With this \n17  bill, Washington leads the way . . . to support these youth as they access gender-affirming \n18  treatment.” Trans Minors Protected from Parents under Washington Law, Associated Press (May \n19  9, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/ynx7nm95.  \n20  82.  In the context of asserting First Amendment and related rights in a pre-enforcement \n21  challenge, so long as the necessary actors have “laid the groundwork,” standing exists even though \n22  those actors “ha[ve] yet to carry out [their] plans.” 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 143 S. Ct. 2298, \n23  2308 (2023). It is enough that they worry that the State of Washington “will force [them] to \n24  express views with which [they] disagrees.” Id.; see also Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 14 (1972) \n25  (noting that pre-enforcement standing is satisfied in the free speech context by claiming “a threat \n26  of specific future harm”).  \n27 \n \nComplaint - 16  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 17 of 35\n \n1  83.  Furthermore,  the  Ninth  Circuit  has  determined  that  a  scenario  where  the \n2  “government has not disavowed enforcement of the [challenged] Provision is evidence of an intent \n3  to enforce it.” Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841, 850 (9th Cir. 2022). \n4  84.  Additionally, given the vagueness of what parents need to do to convince the \n5  Department to return their child and “accomplish a reunification of the family,” it is highly likely \n6  the Department will require parents to affirm through their speech their child’s choices as to \n7  gender identity, thus compelling the parents’ speech. \n8  85.  Likewise, given how SB 5599 now incentivizes youth to run away, knowing how SB \n9  5599 will allow the State to keep their child from them will result in chilling the parents’ speech. \n10  For example, parents may cease using the child’s given name and pronouns that correspond with \n11  the child’s biological sex out of fear caused by SB 5599. \n12  86.  Plaintiffs must show “a credible threat” exists that the State would enforce SB 5599 \n13  against them. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014). \n14  87.  Here,  this  credible  threat  exists  because  of  Washington’s  “record  of  past \n15  enforcement actions under” similar statutes. See 303 Creative, 143 S. Ct. at 2309. Here, as in \n16  multiple U.S. Supreme Court cases, unless Washington is ready to publicly “disavow future \n17  enforcement” of such laws, id. at 2310 (internal quotation marks omitted), Plaintiffs have standing \n18  to challenge them.  \n19  88.  Attorney  General  Ferguson  has  amply  demonstrated  his  enthusiasm  for \n20  aggressively enforcing laws pertaining to being transgender.  \n21  89.  For example, he filed an amicus brief supporting trans bathrooms in public schools. \n22  See AG Ferguson in Gavin Grimm Case: Uphold Transgender Rights, Wash. State Off. of the Att’y \n23  Gen.

Attorney General Ferguson also aggressively pursues this transgender agenda even \n2  when it infringes upon religious liberty. See, e.g., Nina Shapiro, Seattle Pacific University Sues WA \n3  Attorney General, Saying Probe Into LGBTQ+ Policies Violates Religious Freedom, Seattle Times \n4  (July 30, 2022), https://tinyurl.com/nhe9jp3b. \n5  91.  Additionally, the immediate likelihood of harm from SB 5599 is present because \n6  several of the Plaintiffs here have dealt with potential runaway children.  \n7  92.  Parent  2A  and  Parent  2B  have  two  transgender  children  who  have  credibly \n8  threatened to run away and explore places they could go. Both children are biological females. This \n9  included one instance where the older, driving-age child was ready to provide transportation to \n10  take  the  younger child  (too  young  to  drive)  to an environment  that  would provide gender \n11  affirmation.  \n12  93.  A primary reason the children of Parent 2A and Parent 2B threatened to run away \n13  and explored doing so is because the parents declined to refer to the children by their preferred \n14  names and pronouns, and instead referred to them by their birth names and biological pronouns.  \n15  94.  Parent 3A and Parent 3B also dealt with a potential runaway situation. One of their \n16  transgender children was encouraged by some adults to run away from their home and live in a \n17  place where the adults in charge would verbalize gender affirmation by using opposite-sex names \n18  and pronouns.  \n19  95.  Two such adults offered their home as such a place. Parents 3A and 3B believe that \n20  a similar episode recently occurred with another of their transgender children, in which the parents \n21  of a school friend surreptitiously arranged for their child to spend time in the home, during which \n22  time the parents of the school friend would speak to the child of Parents 3A and 3B with the child’s \n23  preferred transgender name and preferred pronouns. \n24  96.  And even for those Plaintiffs whose children have not threatened to run away, SB \n25  5599 changes the legal landscape such that children who may not have considered running away \n26  before now have an incentive to do so under the law because they can obtain health care services \n27  they desire without parental permission.  \n \nComplaint - 18  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v.

For all these reasons, SB 5599 creates a significant risk that if one of Plaintiffs’ \n2  children  wishes  to  transition  to  a  gender  different  from  their  biological  sex—and  that  is  a \n3  substantial risk for each of the children described above--one of the Defendants or their agents \n4  would facilitate the child’s obtaining such a transition, contrary to the parents’ desires for their \n5  children, or contrary to their religious beliefs, or both. Such an action by an agent of the State of \n6  Washington  would  violate  the  affected  Plaintiffs’  constitutional  right  to  direct  their  child’s \n7  upbringing, and their First Amendment right to teach and guide their child’s activities in a manner \n8  consistent with the parents’ faith commitments. This significant risk of a constitutional violation \n9  is the proximate result of SB5599.  \n10  V.  Causes of Action.  \n11  A.  Count I: Federal Due Process Clause—Parents’ Right to Direct Upbringing of \n12  Children; U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1, Cl. 3.  \n13  98.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations made in each preceding paragraph of \n14  this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  \n15  99.  The Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \n16  Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, includes certain substantive rights. Fundamental rights \n17  under the Constitution of the United States are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and \n18  tradition,” such that the right is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty.” McDonald v. \n19  City of Chi., 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).  \n20  100.  Among these is parents’ fundamental right to direct their children’s upbringing. \n21  Pierce v. Soc’y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534–35 (1925); see also Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66 \n22  (2000)  (plurality  opinion)  (discussing  a  long  line  of  cases  where  the  Supreme  Court  has \n23  “recognized the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and \n24  control of their children”). \n25  101.  Because the “right to rear children without undue governmental interference is a \n26  fundamental component of due process,” laws that burden that right are subject to strict scrutiny, \n27  whereby the Fourteenth Amendment “forbids the government to infringe certain fundamental \n \nComplaint - 19  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v.

City of San Diego, 114 F.3d 935, 951-\n3  52 (9th Cir. 1997) (emphasis omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n4  102.  A parent dealing with a child who seeks “gender-affirming” treatment is dealing \n5  with an archetypal issue of raising and the upbringing of that child. \n6  103.  A parent has the right to make medical decisions for his or her child. SB 5599 \n7  violates that right by giving the Department authority to make referrals, without notice to or \n8  consultation with parents, for “appropriate behavioral health services” for a child seeking gender-\n9  affirming care. \n10  104.  SB  5599  thus  interferes  with  the  fundamental  right  of  parents  to  direct  the \n11  upbringing of children dealing with those two issues, including children of several Plaintiffs here, \n12  by authorizing the child to engage in “treatment” not authorized by the parent, by authorizing the \n13  State to provide such treatment, and by preventing parents from raising their children in the \n14  manner they think best.  \n15  105.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n16  106.  The actions Defendants are now required to take under SB 5599 violate federal law, \n17  specifically by violating Plaintiffs’ right to direct the upbringing of their children. Absent injunctive \n18  relief, Defendants’ actions continue to threaten to harm Plaintiffs by impairing their enjoyment of \n19  this right.  \n20  B.  Count II: Federal Due Process Clause—Parents’ Right to Custody of Children; U.S. \n21  Const. Amend. XIV, § 1, Cl. 3.  \n22  107.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations made in each preceding paragraph of \n23  this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  \n24  108.  The Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause secures the related \n25  substantive right of parents to have custody of their children. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 \n26  (1923); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982) (recognizing “[t]he fundamental liberty \n27  interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child”). Here, this is \n \nComplaint - 20  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O.

Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 \n2  U.S. 494, 498–500 (1977) (plurality opinion); Halet v. Wend Inv. Co., 672 F.2d 1305, 1311 (9th Cir. \n3  1982).  \n4  109.  By denying to parents of children who seek the aforementioned health care services \n5  information about the location of their children, as well as the custody and control of their children, \n6  SB 5599 interferes with the fundamental right of parents to have custody of their children and keep \n7  the family unit together as a household.  \n8  110.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n9  111.  The actions Defendants are now required to take violate federal law, specifically by \n10  violating Plaintiffs’ right to custody of their children and their right to keep their family together. \n11  Absent injunctive relief, Defendants’ actions continue to threaten to harm Plaintiffs by impairing \n12  their enjoyment of this right. \n13  C.  Count III: Federal Free Exercise Clause; U.S. Const. Amend. I, Cl. 2.  \n14  112.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations made in each preceding paragraph of \n15  this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  \n16  113.  The  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States \n17  Constitution mandates that no instrumentality of any government in the United States shall enact \n18  any “law … prohibiting the free exercise” of religion. U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 2. That right applies \n19  to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See Carson v. Makin, 142 S. Ct. 1987, 1996 \n20  (2022).  \n21  114.  The Free Exercise Clause protects the right of individuals “to live out their faiths \n22  in daily life through the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts.” Kennedy v. Bremerton \n23  Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2421 (2022) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n24  115.  Also, “[t]he Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment protects against indirect \n25  coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.” Carson, 142 \n26  S. Ct. at 1996 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n27 \n \nComplaint - 21  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 22 of 35\n \n1  116.  The free exercise of religion is a fundamental right, and a law goes to the core of \n2  that protected right when it involves raising children in accordance with the parents’ religious faith. \n3  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 214 (1972). \n4  117.  A parent cannot raise a child in accordance with his or her faith if the parent cannot \n5  communicate with, know the location of, or control the custody and care of their child, abilities \n6  that are denied under SB 5599 to parents whose children show up at a shelter and seek or are \n7  receiving the protected health care services noted above. \n8  118.  A parent has the right to make medical decisions for his or her child consistent with \n9  the parent’s religious faith. SB 5599 violates that right by giving the Department authority to make \n10  referrals for “appropriate behavioral health services” for a child seeking “gender-affirming” \n11  treatment.  \n12  119.  Furthermore, SB 5599 provides that the Department shall offer “services designed \n13  to  resolve  the  conflict  and  accomplish  a  reunification  of  the  family.”  Wash.  Rev.  Code  § \n14  13.32A.082(3)(b)(ii). To the extent that doing so would violate the religious beliefs of those \n15  parents, as it could well do with Parents 3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B, it penalizes the parents for living in \n16  accordance with their faith. \n17  120.  Under free exercise doctrine, even if a law is neutral and generally applicable to \n18  religiously motivated conduct, strict scrutiny is still warranted when the Free Exercise Clause and \n19  “other constitutional protections” are involved, such as parental rights. Emp. Div., Dep’t of Hum. \n20  Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 881 (1990) (citing Yoder, 406 U.S. 205). \n21  121.  Even if SB 5599 would typically be considered a neutral and generally applicable \n22  law, the Supreme Court specifically held in Yoder that laws that interfere with raising children \n23  according to the parents’ religious faith are subject to strict scrutiny, and Yoder remains good law. \n24  Thus, strict scrutiny applies here under Yoder and Smith’s recognition that both free exercise and \n25  parental rights are implicated. \n26  122.  Strict scrutiny is a high bar. As the U.S. Supreme Court has emphasized, a law “can \n27  survive strict scrutiny only if it advances ‘interests of the highest order’ and is narrowly tailored to \n \nComplaint - 22  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v.

Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 23 of 35\n \n1  achieve those interests.” Fulton v. City of Phila., 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1881 (2021) (quoting Church of the \n2  Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc., v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993)). “Put another way, so long \n3  as the government can achieve its interests in a manner that does not burden religion, it must do \n4  so.” Id. \n5  123.  Defendants cannot satisfy strict scrutiny here because, even if they can satisfy the \n6  compelling-interest prong of the test, the law is not narrowly tailored because it is overinclusive, \n7  sweeping in situations where there is no abuse or neglect, as well as situations where the child may \n8  have shown up at a shelter having nothing to do with “gender-affirming” treatment. See Lukumi, \n9  508 U.S. at 538 (finding laws violated the Free Exercise Clause because “they proscribe more \n10  religious conduct than is necessary to achieve their stated ends”).  \n11  124.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n12  125.  The actions Defendants are now required to take violate federal law, specifically by \n13  violating Plaintiffs’ right to raise their children according to the parents’ faith. Absent injunctive \n14  relief, Defendants’ actions continue to threaten to harm Plaintiffs. \n15  D.  Count IV: Federal Free Speech Clause; U.S. Const. Amend. I, Cl. 3.  \n16  126.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations made in each preceding paragraph of \n17  this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n18  127.  The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \n19  mandates that no instrumentality of any government in the United States shall enact any “law … \n20  abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 3. That right applies to the States \n21  through the Fourteenth Amendment. Prete v. Bradbury, 438 F.3d 949, 961 (9th Cir. 2006).  \n22  128.  Yet another reason for First Amendment protections is “because the freedom of \n23  thought and speech is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. By allowing all \n24  views to flourish, the framers understood, we may test and improve our own thinking both as \n25  individuals and as a Nation.” 303 Creative, 143 S. Ct. at 2311 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n26  “Gender-affirming” treatment is one of the most controversial political issues in American life, \n27  meriting the apex of First Amendment protection. \n \nComplaint - 23  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 24 of 35\n \n1  129.  SB  5599  has  the  effect  of  simultaneously  compelling  and  chilling  speech  in \n2  accordance with the views of the majority of the state legislature and the Governor. \n3  130.  The legislative history of SB 5599 shows the statute’s supporters equate a parent \n4  who does not verbally affirm a child’s gender identity by using the child’s preferred names and \n5  pronouns with an abusive environment, arguing that such abuse is what makes the statute’s \n6  provisions necessary. By doing so, SB 5599 chills protected speech, as parents with a transgender \n7  child may fear to use certain speech (birth name, preferred pronouns) or say certain things (“You \n8  are still the same gender as when you were born”) that could lead to the child seeking to trigger SB \n9  5599. And chilling free speech can violate the Constitution. See Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs v. Umbehr, \n10  518 U.S. 668, 674 (1996) (“[C]onstitutional violations may arise from the deterrent, or ‘chilling,’ \n11  effect of governmental efforts that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First \n12  Amendment rights . . . .”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n13  131.  Likewise,  the  vagueness  associated  with  what parents  must  do  to qualify  for \n14  reunification with their child violates the First Amendment by chilling speech. See F.C.C. v. Fox \n15  Television  Stations,  Inc.,  567  U.S.  239,  253–54  (2012)  (“When  speech  is  involved,  rigorous \n16  adherence to [void for vagueness doctrine] requirements is necessary to ensure that ambiguity does \n17  not chill protected speech.”); see also Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 588 \n18  (1998). \n19  132.  When parents speak on issues of “gender-affirming” treatment with their children, \n20  the right to free speech converges with the fundamental right to raise children.  \n21  133.  For Plaintiffs 3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B, this aspect of SB 5599 infringes upon a third \n22  fundamental right. Speaking words based on faith is protected by both the Free Speech Clause and \n23  the Free Exercise Clause. An example is prayer, regarding which the Supreme Court held that \n24  “[b]oth the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment protect [those] \n25  expressions . . . .” Kennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2416. Given that the right to direct the upbringing of \n26  children is implicated as well, when the parent speaks on gender identity from the vantage point of \n27  religious faith, SB 5599 sits on a nexus of at least three violations of fundamental rights.  \n \nComplaint - 24  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 25 of 35\n \n1  134.  As to compelled speech, SB 5599 provides that the Department shall offer “services \n2  designed to resolve the conflict and accomplish a reunification of the family.” To the extent that \n3  such “reunification” would be contingent on the parents’ using a child’s preferred name and \n4  preferred pronouns, the Department would be compelling speech by coercing a parent to say words \n5  they do not believe.  \n6  135.  For parents such as Plaintiffs here, even when LGBT issues and children are \n7  concerned, the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment does not allow the State to \n8  “interfere with [their] choice not to propound a point of view contrary to [their] beliefs.” Boy \n9  Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 654 (2000). “As these cases illustrate, the First Amendment \n10  protects an individual’s right to speak his mind regardless of whether the government considers \n11  his speech sensible and well intentioned or deeply misguided, and likely to cause anguish or \n12  incalculable grief.” 303 Creative, 143 S. Ct. at 2312 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n13  136.  These protections are heightened, if anything, where the State commands that a \n14  person must give utterance to particular views because, as a general matter, “the government may \n15  not compel a person to speak its own preferred messages.” Id.  \n16  137.  SB 5599 thus abridges free speech in three regards. First, it penalizes parents for \n17  expressing their views on gender identity.  \n18  138.  Second, this is also compelled speech. SB 5599 penalizes parents for not expressing \n19  support for a child’s gender identity, including not using “preferred pronouns” when speaking to \n20  or referring to a transgender child, equating such speech with child abuse. Compelled speech \n21  violates the Free Speech Clause. See Janus v. Am. Fed’n of State, Cnty., & Mun. Emps., 138 S. Ct. \n22  2448, 2463 (2018) (“We have held time and again that freedom of speech ‘includes both the right \n23  to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.’”) (quoting Wooley v. Maynard, 430 \n24  U.S. 705, 714 (1977)); see also W. Va. Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943) (“If there is \n25  any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe \n26  what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens \n27  to confess by word or act their faith therein.”) (emphasis added). \n \nComplaint - 25  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v.

Third, SB 5599 chills parents’ speech. \n2  140.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n3  141.  The actions Defendants are now effectively required and allowed to take violate the \n4  U.S. Constitution, specifically by posing a substantial threat to Plaintiffs’ rights to freely express \n5  their views on these issues and to refrain from speech that contradicts the State’s preferred views. \n6  Absent injunctive relief, Defendants’ actions continue to threaten to harm Plaintiffs. \n7  E.  Count V: Federal Equal Protection Clause; U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1, Cl. 4.  \n8  142.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations made in each preceding paragraph of \n9  this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n10  143.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. \n11  XIV, § 1, cl. 4, guarantees Plaintiffs equal protection of the laws, “which is essentially a direction \n12  that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., \n13  473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  \n14  144.  Strict scrutiny applies “when the classification impermissibly interferes with the \n15  exercise of a fundamental right.” Halet, 672 F.2d at 1310.  \n16  145.  Before SB 5599, Wash. Rev. Code § 13.32A.082(3) generally allowed every parent \n17  to be notified of the location and condition of a child who is taken in by a homeless shelter. The \n18  previous version of Subsection 3 allowed that information to be withheld only if there is a \n19  compelling reason to do so, which includes circumstances indicating traditional abuse or neglect \n20  and requiring an individualized inquiry.  \n21  146.  However, SB 5599 amends Subsection 3 to say that if a child claims to be seeking \n22  “gender-affirming” treatment—and only for that reason—then “compelling reasons” under \n23  Washington law are per se established. \n24  147.  SB 5599 thereby treats parents of children seeking or receiving “gender-affirming” \n25  treatment categorically differently from other parents, dividing parents into two classes drawn on \n26  lines that implicate fundamental rights to the upbringing and custody of their children, and for \n27 \n \nComplaint - 26  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v.

This unequal treatment, therefore, triggers strict scrutiny.  \n4  149.  Indeed, singling out only parents of children claiming to be undergoing or seeking \n5  “gender-affirming” treatment is irrational. That is because, among other things, the treatment \n6  their children are seeking or receiving unconnected to parental behavior is irrational, and, as such, \n7  would fail any level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, including the minimal standard \n8  of rational-basis review.  \n9  150.  A majority of the legislature has legislatively punished parents who are not fully \n10  onboard with so-called “gender-affirming treatment.” Singling them out for disparate treatment \n11  without evidence of abuse or neglect thus violates even rational basis review. See U.S. Dep’t of \n12  Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973) (“For if the constitutional conception of ‘equal \n13  protection of the laws’ means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare congressional \n14  desire  to  harm  a  politically  unpopular  group  cannot  constitute  a  legitimate  governmental \n15  interest.”). \n16  151.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n17  152.  The actions Defendants are now required to take violate the U.S. Constitution, \n18  specifically by posing a substantial threat to Plaintiffs’ right to equal protection on a matter \n19  implicating  those  parents’  fundamental  rights.

Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights are implicated here. \n2  156.  When due process is implicated, “the question remains what process is due.” FDIC \n3  v. Mallen, 486 U.S. 230, 240 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). “The fundamental \n4  requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful \n5  manner.” Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n6  157.  Generally, the Due Process Clause ensures a fair hearing by an unbiased decision \n7  maker. See, e.g., Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972). Here, however, parents of children \n8  who claim to be receiving or seeking certain treatment are immediately deprived of their rights to \n9  direct the upbringing of their children or to raise children in the parents’ faith tradition with no \n10  process whatsoever.  \n11  158.  Even for accusations of domestic violence or severe substance abuse, Subsection 3 \n12  provides due process by allowing for an individualized assessment to see if there is a compelling \n13  reason to withhold information about the child’s whereabouts from the parents. But for parents of \n14  children seeking “gender-affirming treatment,” there is not even a minimal procedure to provide \n15  due process. This lack of even minimal process is a violation of due process.  \n16  159.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n17  160.  The actions Defendants are now required or allowed to take violate the U.S. \n18  Constitution, specifically by posing a substantial threat to Plaintiffs’ right not to be deprived of any \n19  liberty interest without due process of law. Absent injunctive relief, Defendants’ actions continue \n20  to threaten to harm Plaintiffs. \n21  G.  Count VII: Federal Due Process Clause—Void for Vagueness; U.S. Const. Amend. \n22  XIV, § 1, Cl. 3.  \n23  161.  Due process requires “that laws which regulate persons or entities must give fair \n24  notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.” Fox Television, 567 U.S. at 253. A statute falls \n25  short of this standard when its terms are “so vague that men of common intelligence must \n26  necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.” Id.

All Washington parents “are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or \n2  forbids.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n3  162.  It is not entirely clear whether the provision in SB 5599 regarding reconciliation and \n4  reunification services allows the Department or a provider to condition such reconciliation or \n5  reunification on the parents agreeing to call a transgender child by the child’s preferred name or \n6  pronouns, or agree to allow the child to receive treatment that the child needs parental permission \n7  for but that the parents oppose.  \n8  163.  To the extent SB 5599 is not clear in that regard, it is void for vagueness.  \n9  164.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n10  165.  The actions Defendants are now required to take violate federal law, specifically by \n11  posing a substantial threat to Plaintiffs’ right not to be deprived of any liberty interest without due \n12  process  of  law.  Absent  injunctive  relief,  Defendants’  actions  continue  to  threaten  to  harm \n13  Plaintiffs. \n14  H.  Count VIII: Washington Due Process Clause—Parents’ Right to Rear their Children \n15  Without State Interference; Wash. Const. Art. I, § 3.  \n16  166.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations made in each preceding paragraph of \n17  this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n18  167.  Under the Washington Constitution, “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, \n19  or property, without due process of law.” Wash. Const. Art. I, § 3. \n20  168.  In the context of parental rights, the Washington Supreme Court has observed that \n21  “[t]he family entity is the core element upon which modern civilization is founded.” In re Custody \n22  of Smith, 969 P.2d 21, 28 (Wash. 1998), aff’d sub nom. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57. And \n23  “parents[] . . . primarily have the constitutional right to the custody and control of such minor \n24  children.” In re Brown, 105 P.3d 991, 994 (Wash. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also \n25  In re Custody of B.M.H., 315 P.3d 470, 475 (Wash. 2013) (“[I]n . . . child custody disputes we afford \n26  considerable deference to parents . . . .”). \n27 \n \nComplaint - 29  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 30 of 35\n \n1  169.  Thus, because “[a] parent’s constitutionally protected right to rear his or her \n2  children  without  state  interference[]  .  .  .  [is]  as  a  fundamental  ‘liberty’  interest,”  “state \n3  interference is justified only if the state can show that it has a compelling interest and such \n4  interference is narrowly drawn to meet only the compelling state interest involved.” In re Custody \n5  of Smith, 969 P.2d at 28; see also In re Custody of Shields, 136 P.3d 117, 126 (Wash. 2006) (“[S]tate \n6  interference with a fit parent’s fundamental right to autonomy in child-rearing decisions is subject \n7  to strict scrutiny.”). \n8  170.  The  Defendants  cannot  satisfy  strict  scrutiny  here.  First,  there  cannot  be  a \n9  compelling government interest to deprive parents of their constitutional parental rights just \n10  because their child is receiving or seeking to receive “gender-affirming” care and shows up at a \n11  homeless shelter or host home. There is no connection to the parents’ behavior, and the State \n12  cannot have a compelling interest in displacing a parent unrelated to the parent’s conduct or \n13  condition. \n14  171.  Second, for the same reasons, SB 5599 is not narrowly tailored. It is overinclusive, \n15  sweeping in parents who are not neglectful or abusive into its net. If the law is concerned about \n16  problematic parents, then the law could be more narrowly tailored, as evidenced by the previous \n17  iteration where “compelling reasons” was defined to capture abusive or neglectful parents. \n18  172.  SB 5599 thus violates Plaintiffs’ parental rights under the Washington Constitution.  \n19  173.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n20  174.  The actions Defendants are now required to take violate state law, specifically by \n21  posing a substantial threat to Plaintiffs’ right not to be deprived of any liberty interest without due \n22  process  of  law.  Absent  injunctive  relief,  Defendants’  actions  continue  to  threaten  to  harm \n23  Plaintiffs. \n24  I.  Count IX: Washington Special Privileges and Immunities Clause; Wash. Const. Art. \n25  I, § 12.  \n26  175.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations made in each preceding paragraph of \n27  this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n \nComplaint - 30  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 31 of 35\n \n1  176.  The Washington Constitution states, “No law shall be passed granting to any \n2  citizen, class of citizens, or corporation other than municipal, privileges or immunities which upon \n3  the same terms shall not equally belong to all citizens, or corporations.” Wash. Const. Art. I, § 12.  \n4  177.  The  Washington  Supreme  Court  has  “construed  article  I,  section  12  of  the \n5  Washington Constitution to be consistent with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth \n6  Amendment.” Wash. Food Indus. Ass’n & Maplebear, Inc. v. City of Seattle, 524 P.3d 181, 195 (Wash. \n7  2023) (citing Ockletree v. Franciscan Health Sys., 317 P.3d 1009, 1013-14 (Wash. 2014)). \n8  178.  However, “[t]he article I, section 12 reasonable ground test is more exacting than \n9  rational basis review.” Schroeder v. Weighall, 316 P.3d 482, 486 (Wash. 2014). “Under the \n10  reasonable ground test a court will not hypothesize facts to justify a legislative distinction.” Id. \n11  “Rather, the court will scrutinize the legislative distinction to determine whether it in fact serves \n12  the legislature’s stated goal.” Id. \n13  179.  The reasonable ground test is not satisfied here: because by lumping all parents of \n14  children who show up at shelters demanding or receiving “gender-affirming” treatment into one \n15  category, there is a mismatch between the legislature’s goal of helping children who are being \n16  mistreated by their parents and the parents covered by the law. And the law makes no attempt to \n17  sort these parents into different groups for differing treatment.  \n18  180.  The law thus does not serve the legislature’s stated goal because it will separate \n19  children from parents when there is no need. SB 5599, therefore, violates Article I, Section 12 of \n20  the Washington Constitution. \n21  181.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n22  182.  The actions Defendants are now required to take violate state law, specifically by \n23  posing a substantial threat to Plaintiffs’ right not to be deprived of any liberty interest without due \n24  process  of  law.  Absent  injunctive  relief,  Defendants’  actions  continue  to  threaten  to  harm \n25  Plaintiffs. \n26 \n27 \n \nComplaint - 31  Ard Law Group PLLC \nIPEC v. Inslee, No. 3:23-cv-5736  P.O. Box 11633 \nBainbridge Island, WA 98110 \nPhone: (206) 701-9243 \n \n \n\nCase 3:23-cv-05736-DGE   Document 1   Filed 08/16/23   Page 32 of 35\n \n1  J.  Count X: Washington Free Speech Clause; Wash. Const. Art. I, § 5.  \n2  183.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations made in each preceding paragraph of \n3  this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n4  184.  The Washington Constitution declares, “Every person may freely speak, write and \n5  publish on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right.” Wash. Const. Art. I, § 5. \n6  185.  The clause provides that “parents have a right to determine the manner in which \n7  delicate moral issues will be discussed with their young children.” Bering v. SHARE, 721 P.2d 918, \n8  937 (Wash. 1986); see also id. (“The parents’ right to direct the rearing of their children clearly is \n9  deserving of the State’s protection.”). \n10  186.  SB 5599 violates this clause of the Washington Constitution by violating parents’ \n11  rights to teach and discuss the “delicate moral issues” surrounding gender identity. It does so in \n12  two ways. \n13  187.  First, it chills parental speech both before a child runs away, when the parent is \n14  trying to get the child back, and after the child has been returned. SB 5599 will force parents to \n15  avoid any speech that their child or the State may disagree with, such as using the child’s biological \n16  pronouns and birth name, or affirming the child’s chosen gender identity. \n17  188.  Second, SB 5599 compels parents to engage in speech contrary to the parents’ views \n18  on “delicate moral issues” that align with their child and the State’s views. \n19  189.  SB 5599 does all this by creating a legal environment wherein if the parent does not \n20  do what the child wants, the child can just run away and get the state to provide what the child \n21  desires. And once that has occurred, for the parents to convince the State to reunify the child with \n22  them, the parents must confirm through their speech the State’s views on gender identity and \n23  avoid saying anything to their child with which the State disagrees. \n24  190.  Thus, SB 5599 violates Article I, Section 5 of the Washington Constitution. \n25  191.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n26  192.
