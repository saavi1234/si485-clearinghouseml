After years of rigorous environmental review, intergovernmental coordination, and \nsubstantial  public  and  private  investment,  the  Revolution  Wind  project—a  cornerstone  of \nConnecticut and Rhode Island’s clean energy future—was abruptly halted by federal officials \nwithout statutory authority, regulatory justification, or factual basis. The Revolution Wind project \nis not speculative. It is real, fully permitted, and nearly complete. Located fifteen nautical miles \noff Rhode Island’s shore, Revolution Wind is a wind energy facility that is expected to deliver \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 2 of 44 PageID #: 2\nenough electricity to the New England grid to power 350,000 homes, the equivalent of 2.5% of \nthe region’s electricity supply. Connecticut and Rhode Island are relying on Revolution Wind to \nmeet their electricity needs and renewable energy goals.  \n2.  The 704 megawatts (MW) of power that Revolution Wind is expected to produce \non an annual basis is the subject of power purchase agreements—in Connecticut with Eversource \nand United Illuminating for 304 MW and in Rhode Island with Rhode Island Energy for 400 MW. \nRevolution Wind makes landfall in North Kingstown, Rhode Island.  \n3.  The Project has been vetted through every layer of the federal and state regulatory \nprocess, culminating in a 2,800-page Final Environmental Impact Statement and a joint Record of \nDecision issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and several other federal \nagencies. It is also supported by binding contracts, state law mandates, and the urgent need to \nsecure a reliable, affordable, and emissions-free energy supply for the people of New England. \n4.  Construction  on  the  Revolution  Wind  project  began  in  2023  and  is  now \napproximately 80% complete. All offshore foundations are installed, and approximately 70% (45 \nof 65) of its turbines are ready for operation once construction is complete in 2026. The submerged \narray cables have been installed at 34 of the 65 wind turbine sites. The utility export cable has 84 \nof the 85 miles installed. One of the two offshore wind utility substations on a monopile foundation \nhas been installed in federal waters.  \n5.  Over 90% of the physical construction has been substantially completed at the \nmainland interconnection site at the Quonset Development Business Park in North Kingstown, \nRhode Island, where the power from the Revolution Wind project will be delivered into the \nregional energy system.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 3 of 44 PageID #: 3\n6.  Yet in the face of this exhaustive record and the States’ deep reliance interests, the \nfederal government has arbitrarily reversed course without explanation, factual findings, or legal \nauthority. On August 22, 2025, the Acting Director of BOEM issued a Stop Work Order requiring \nRevolution Wind’s developer, Ørsted, to immediately stop construction. Ex. A (Order). The Order \ndoes not identify any violation of law, any imminent threat to safety, or any judicial decree \nrequiring suspension. It instead abstractly cites BOEM’s general regulatory authority under the \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and directs Ørsted to stop constructing Revolution \nWind so that BOEM can address purported “concerns” it has with the Project. The Order does not \nbother to mention what those concerns are, provide any reasoned explanation for an indefinite halt \nof a Project that BOEM has already extensively reviewed and approved, or provide any guidance \nabout whether the Order is a lease suspension, cessation order, notice of noncompliance, or other \ndefined agency action. \n7.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and OCSLA do not permit such arbitrary \nand capricious government conduct. Rather, these laws demand reasoned decision-making, fidelity \nto statutory limits, and respect for the settled expectations of sovereign States and regulated parties.  \n8.  The States of Connecticut and Rhode Island sue to vindicate those principles. They \nseek to restore the rule of law, protect their energy and economic interests, and ensure that the \nfederal government honors its commitments. \n9.  The Stop Work Order is arbitrary and capricious under the APA. First, the Order \nwas issued with no rational explanation for halting Revolution Wind. Second, the Stop Work Order \noffers no justification for BOEM’s abrupt change in position. It fails to identify any deficiency in \nthe  nine-year  regulatory  review  process  that  resulted  in BOEM’s  joint  Record  of  Decision \napproving Revolution Wind and finding that it complies with OCSLA’s requirements. Third, the \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 4 of 44 PageID #: 4\nStop Work  Order  contradicts  recent  federal  policy  that  calls  for  increased  domestic-energy \nproduction—a category into which wind energy falls—and expedites environmental review for \nthose projects. Finally, the Stop Work Order ignores the serious reliance interests that Connecticut \nand Rhode Island have developed since the federal government approved Revolution Wind.  \n10.  The Stop Work Order also violates OCSLA and its implementing regulations, which \nallow the United States Department of the Interior and BOEM to temporarily halt wind energy \nproject construction only if certain conditions are met. They were not met here, and so in addition \nto violating OCSLA, the Order is ultra vires and contrary to law under the APA. \n11.  The  Stop Work  Order’s  immediate  and  indefinite  halt  to  the  construction  of \nRevolution Wind represents an existential threat to Revolution Wind that has disrupted the project \nand threatens its viability. The wind energy industry operates in a complex logistical and regulatory \nenvironment where even minor setbacks can dramatically increase costs, including the costs of \ndelays, and jeopardize a project’s future. \n12.  The Stop Work Order also harms Connecticut and Rhode Island. Revolution Wind \nrepresents the fruition of the States’ decades-long efforts to secure reliable, diversified, and \naffordable sources of energy to meet their ever-increasing demand for electricity. It is also the \nresult of the States’ statutory- and policy-based efforts to protect public health and welfare from \nharmful greenhouse-gas emissions. The States will not realize Revolution Wind’s benefits as \nscheduled in 2026 unless the Stop Work Order is enjoined.  \n13.  Because the Stop Work Order jeopardizes a project that is critical to the States’ \neconomic vitality, energy mix, and climate goals, the States ask this Court to declare the Stop Work \nOrder unlawful and enjoin Agency Defendants from halting Revolution Wind’s development. \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 5 of 44 PageID #: 5\nPARTIES \n \n14.  Plaintiff State of Rhode Island is a sovereign state in the United States of America. \nRhode  Island  is  represented  by Attorney  General  Peter  F.  Neronha,  who  is  the  chief  law \nenforcement officer of Rhode Island. \n15.  Plaintiff State of Connecticut is a sovereign state in the United States of America. \nConnecticut is represented by Attorney General William Tong, who is the chief law enforcement \nofficer of Connecticut.  \n16.  Plaintiff  Katherine  Dykes,  Commissioner  of  the  Department  of  Energy  and \nEnvironmental Protection of the State of Connecticut, is an executive agent of the State of \nConnecticut and has a broad mandate to ensure access to safe, reliable utility service at just and \nreasonable rates, while protecting the natural environment. \n17.  Defendant United States Department of the Interior (DOI) is a cabinet agency \nwithin the executive branch of the United States government. 43  U.S.C. § 1451.

BSEE is \nresponsible, among other things, for safety and environmental enforcement functions including, \nbut not limited to, the authority to permit activities; inspect, investigate, cancel or suspend \nactivities; and oversee safety, response, and removal preparedness. \n22.  Defendant Kenneth Stevens is the Principal Deputy Director of BSEE. He is sued \nin his official capacity. Principal Deputy Director Stevens is responsible for the issuance of \ncessation orders by BSEE, a prerequisite to the issuance of a Stop Work Order. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n23.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case because it arises under the \nlaws of the United States. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2201(a). The Court also has jurisdiction under the \njudicial-review provisions of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 702, as well as OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. § 1349(b). \n24.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), (e)(1). Defendants are \nUnited States officers and agencies sued in their official capacities, and they perform their official \nduties in Rhode Island. A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this Complaint \noccurred and continues to occur within Rhode Island. Rhode Island is the “State nearest the place \nthe cause of action arose.” 43 U.S.C. 1349(b)(1). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 7 of 44 PageID #: 7\nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n \n25.  OCSLA states that the Outer Continental Shelf is “a vital national resource reserve \nheld by the Federal Government for the public,” and directs the Interior Secretary to facilitate its \n“expeditious  and  orderly  development”  while  maintaining  competition  and  environmental \nsafeguards. 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3). \n26.  In 2005, Congress amended OCSLA to authorize the Interior Secretary to issue \nleases on the Outer Continental Shelf for renewable energy production. See Energy Policy Act of \n2005, Pub. L. No. 109-58 § 388, 119 Stat. 594, 744–45 (2005). Under subsection 8(p) of OCSLA, \nthe Interior Secretary, in consultation with relevant federal agencies, may “grant a lease, easement, \nor right-of-way” for activities that “produce or support production, transportation, or transmission \nof  energy  from  sources  other  than  oil  and  gas,”  including  offshore  wind.  43  U.S.C.  §§ \n1337(p)(1)(C), 1356c. The Interior Secretary “shall ensure that any activity” authorized “is carried \nout in a manner that provides for” a set of twelve enumerated factors, including safety, national \nsecurity, protection of the environment, prevention of waste, and prevention of interference with \nother reasonable uses of the Outer Continental Shelf. 43 U.S.C. § 1337(p)(4).  \n27.  BOEM  administers  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf  leasing  program,  including \nidentifying leasing areas, conducting environmental assessments before leasing, and then leasing \nthe areas out, usually through a competitive bidding process. See 30 C.F.R. §§ 585.102, 585.210. \n28.   Once a lease is sold, a lessee must submit a Site Assessment Plan for site-\nassessment activities. 30 C.F.R. §§ 585.600, 585.605–585.613. If BOEM approves the Site \nAssessment Plan, the lessee has five years to conduct site assessment activities to gather necessary \ndata. Id. § 585.235(a)(2). The lessee must then prepare a proposal for the development of a wind \nenergy facility and submit an application for a Construction and Operations Plan. Id. §§ 585.600, \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 8 of 44 PageID #: 8\n585.620–585.629. Next, BOEM must prepare “an appropriate [National Environmental Policy \nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370m-12] analysis.” 30 C.F.R. § 585.628. BOEM must review the \napplication to ensure compliance with OCSLA and its regulations, and then “approve, disapprove, \nor approve [the plan] with modifications.” 30 C.F.R. §§ 585.613(e), 585.628(f).  \n29.  Section 585.102(a) of BOEM’s regulations require BOEM to ensure that activities \nauthorized under BOEM’s renewable energy regulations are carried out “in a manner that provides \nfor and reaches a rational balance among” the twelve factors enumerated by OCSLA. 30 C.F.R. § \n585.102(a). The regulations also state that “[t]o the extent [the factors] conflict or are otherwise in \ntension, none of [the factors] inherently outweighs or supplants any other[.]” Id. \n30.  OCSLA authorizes DOI to suspend or temporarily prohibit any operation or activity \npursuant to a lease at the request of a lessee, or if there is “a threat of serious, irreparable, or \nimmediate harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral \ndeposits (in areas leased or not leased), or to the marine, coastal, or human environment.” 43 \nU.S.C. 1334(a)(1). \n31.  BOEM may order a lease suspension in only two circumstances: (1) “[w]hen \nnecessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting some or all activities under [the] lease” and \n(2) “[w]hen the suspension is necessary for reasons of national security or defense.” 30 C.F.R. § \n585.417. If BOEM orders a suspension, it must issue a written order that “will explain the reasons \nfor its issuance and describe the effect of the suspension order on [the] lease.” 30 C.F.R. § 585.418. \n32.  BSEE, a separate bureau within DOI, is tasked with issuing cessation orders. BSEE \nis authorized to do so when a lessee “fail[s] to comply with an applicable law; regulation; order; \nor provision of a lease, grant, plan, or BSEE or BOEM approval.” 30 C.F.R. § 285.401(a). With \ncertain exceptions, BSEE will allow time for a lessee to correct any noncompliance before issuing \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 9 of 44 PageID #: 9\na cessation order. Id. A cessation order must set forth the measures the lessee must take to resume \nactivities on the lease. Id. § 285.401(b).   \n33.  In addition, BSEE may suspend a lease: (1) “[w]hen necessary to comply with \njudicial decrees prohibiting some or all activities under [the] lease,” or (2) “[w]hen continued \nactivities pose an imminent threat of serious or irreparable harm or damage to natural resources; \nlife (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, \nstructures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance.” 30 C.F.R. § 285.417. Activities \nmay not be conducted on the lease during the period of suspension, unless expressly authorized. \n30 C.F.R. § 285.415(c). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \nI.  Energy Standards and Solicitation of Proposals  \n \na.  Connecticut  \n \n34.  The State of Connecticut is reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-\nburning power plants by participating in the multi-state, market-based program known as the \nRegional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. \n35.  Connecticut  has  worked  to  shift  reliance  away  from  fossil  fuels  and  toward \nrenewable energy sources, including wind. Connecticut has had a Renewable Portfolio Standard \n(RPS) in some form since 1998. The RPS requires electric suppliers  to obtain a specified \npercentage of the energy they sell or distribute to Connecticut customers from renewable sources \nthrough the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates. The total renewable output targets \nincrease each year. See Conn. Gen. Stat. § 16-245a. \n36.  Public Act 18-82, “An Act Concerning Climate Change Planning and Resiliency,” \nrequires Connecticut by 2030 to reduce economy-wide greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 45% \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 10 of 44 PageID #: 10\nfrom 2001 greenhouse-gas emissions levels, and at least 80% by 2050. Likewise, Public Act 22-5, \n“An Act  Concerning Climate Change Mitigation,” requires Connecticut to achieve  a 100% \ngreenhouse-gas emissions-free electricity supply by 2040. \n37.  The October 2021 Integrated Resources Plan by the Connecticut Department of \nEnergy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) found that, to achieve Connecticut’s target of a \n100% greenhouse-gas emissions-free electricity supply by 2040, significant additions of new zero-\ncarbon generation will be required.1 This goal requires potentially 3,745 to 5,710 MW of new \noffshore wind by 2040 under a range of assumptions and scenarios, including availability of other \ngenerating resources. \n38.  In addition, in passing Public Act 19-71, “An Act Concerning the Procurement of \nEnergy Derived from Offshore Wind,” codified as Conn. Gen. Stat. § 16a-3n, the Connecticut \nGeneral Assembly created a process for CT DEEP to work with other state officials to solicit \ncompetitive proposals for offshore wind projects. The Act also authorizes CT DEEP to direct \nConnecticut’s electric distribution companies to secure long-term contracts with bidders meeting \ncertain criteria, which CT DEEP has done. CT DEEP also has similar procurement authority for \nadditional Class I renewable energy resources, including offshore wind. Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 16a-\n3f, 16a-3g, 16a-3h, 16a-3j, 16a-3m. \n39.  Connecticut relies on Revolution Wind to satisfy its statutory mandates and achieve \nits policy goals. In 2018 and 2019, CT DEEP exercised its authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ \n16a-3n and 16a-3m to select 200 MW and 104 MW from the Revolution Wind offshore wind \nproject in two separate competitive solicitations. The Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory \n \n1 See State of Connecticut, Integrated Resources Planning, https://portal.ct.gov/deep/energy/integrated-\nresource-planning/integrated-resource-planning; State of Connecticut, Integrated Resources Plan at 132 \n(Oct. 2021), https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/deep/energy/irp/2020-irp/2020-connecticut-integrated-resources-\nplan-10-7-2021.pdf. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 11 of 44 PageID #: 11\nAuthority  later  approved  contracts  between  Revolution  Wind  and  Connecticut’s  electric \ndistribution companies (Eversource and United Illuminating). The Project is expected to reach \ncommercial operation in 2026, at which point it will deliver electricity, and associated renewable \nenergy credits to Connecticut, as well as provide wholesale energy and capacity market and \nreliability benefits to the broader New England grid.  \n40.  Connecticut also has an interest in future procurements of wind energy. Public Act \n19-71 provides CT DEEP with authority to conduct competitive solicitations for up to 2,000 MW \nof additional offshore wind energy to meet Connecticut’s energy needs and clean energy targets. \nCT DEEP also has authority to conduct new competitive solicitations for onshore and offshore \nwind projects under Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 16a-3f, 16a-3g, 16a-3h, 16a-3j, and 16a-3m.  \n41.  Connecticut is working to advance wind energy with other states and ISO-New \nEngland, which is the organization that oversees New England’s power system and wholesale \nelectricity markets. On March 31, 2025, ISO-New England issued a request for proposals from \ntransmission  developers  to  upgrade  the  transmission  grid  in  Maine  to  accommodate  the \ninterconnection of at least 1,200 MW of onshore wind generation to the New England grid.  \nb.  Rhode Island \n \n42.  Like Connecticut, Rhode Island relies on Revolution Wind to satisfy its statutory \nand regulatory requirements under federal and state law. \n43.  Rhode Island is committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards \nsustainable clean energy intended to offset the impacts of harmful greenhouse-gas emissions. The \n2021 Act on Climate sets decarbonization mandates, including requirements that greenhouse gas \nemissions are reduced to 45% below 1990 levels by 2030, 80% below 1990 levels by 2040, and \nthat the state reaches net-zero emissions by 2050. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-6.2-9. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 12 of 44 PageID #: 12\n44.  The State of Rhode Island also participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas \nInitiative. See R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 23-82-1–23-82-7. \n45.  Rhode Island’s Renewable Energy Standard (RI RES) was originally enacted in \n2004 to protect the public health and the environment and to promote the general welfare of the \nState. See R.I. Gen Laws §§ 39-26-1–39-26-10, as enacted June 29, 2004, and amended on June \n27, 2022. As a result of 2022 amendments, the RI RES requires that 100% of Rhode Island’s \nelectricity demand is met by renewable energy by 2033. R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-26-4(a)(14). \n46.  The RI RES seeks to facilitate “the development of new renewable energy resources \nto supply electricity to customers in Rhode Island with goals of stabilizing long-term energy prices, \nenhancing environmental quality, and creating jobs in Rhode Island in the renewable energy \nsector.” R.I. Gen Laws § 39-26-3.  \n47.  The RI RES also requires obligated entities, including utility companies that sell at \nretail to Rhode Island end-use customers, to increase the percentage of their energy that comes \nfrom eligible renewable energy. This requires annual increases, adding between 7% and 9.5% each \nyear from 2026 to 2033. R.I. Gen Laws § 39-26-4. \n48.  Rhode Island’s Affordable Clean Energy Security Act (RI ACES), was enacted in \n2014 and aims to utilize coordinated and competitive processes in the New England region to \nencourage a multi-state or regional approach to energy policy that advances the objectives of \nachieving a reliable, clean-energy future that is consistent with meeting regional greenhouse gas \nreduction goals at reasonable cost to ratepayers. R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-31-2. \n49.  On February 7, 2019, pursuant to the RI ACES, the Narragansett Electric Company, \nd/b/a National Grid, filed a proposed 20 year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between it and \nDWW Rev I, LLC, also known as the Revolution Wind offshore wind project. The Narragansett \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 13 of 44 PageID #: 13\nElectric  Company,  in  consultation  with  Rhode  Island’s  Office  of  Energy  Resources  and \nDepartment of Public Utilities and Carriers, voluntarily selected the 400 MW project to pursue a \nlong-term PPA under RI ACES. \n50.  The  agreement  between  Rhode  Island  Energy  and  Revolution Wind  includes \ncommitments  for  an  additional  $40,000,000  investment  in  Rhode  Island  ports,  including \nsignificant investments in the Port of Davisville, which is owned by the quasi-state agency known \nas the Quonset Development Corporation, as well as $4,500,000 to fund workforce training and \ndevelopment initiatives to grow clean energy in the State. \n51.  The agreements with Revolution Wind govern the distribution of 704 MW of \nelectrical energy to Connecticut and Rhode Island on an annual basis, with 400 MW going to \nRhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut. \n52.  Rhode Island state agencies carefully reviewed Revolution Wind’s proposed PPA \nto ensure that the multistate/regional approach to energy policy among participating states achieves \nthe collective goal of a reliable, clean-energy future at a reasonable cost to Rhode Islanders. \n53.    Following full review, evidentiary hearings, and the issuance of testimony and/or \nadvisory opinions from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, Office of \nEnergy Resources, Department of Public Utilities and Carriers, and the Commerce Corporation, \nthe PPA between Rhode Island Energy and Ørsted was approved by the Rhode Island Public \nUtilities Commission on May 28, 2019.  \n54.  Rhode Island, like Connecticut, is actively involved and invested in regional efforts \nto promote renewable energy with other states and ISO-NE, including the initiatives referenced \nabove.  \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 14 of 44 PageID #: 14\nII.  Federal Permitting of Revolution Wind \n \n55.  The States, Ørsted, and the federal government have been working together for \nmore than a decade to create a wind energy facility off Rhode Island’s shore. In 2009, BOEM \nestablished an intergovernmental task force to coordinate the leasing process for this offshore wind \nproject. Record of Decision at 2.2 In 2013, Deepwater Wind New England, LLC—which Ørsted \nlater acquired—won a BOEM auction for the lease area off the Rhode Island Shore (OCS-A 0486). \nId. at 3. Later that year, BOEM signed and executed Deepwater Wind’s commercial wind energy \nlease (Deepwater Wind Lease).3 \n56.  The lease states: “The Lessor reserves the right to suspend the Lessee’s operations \nin accordance with the national security and defense provisions of section 12 of [OCSLA] and \napplicable regulations.” Deepwater Wind Lease at 2. The lease further states that BOEM may order \noperations to cease “[i]f the Lessee fails to comply with (1) any of the applicable provisions of \n[OCSLA] or [its] regulations, (2) the approved [Site Assessment Plan] or [Construction and \nOperations Plan], or (3) the terms of this lease.” Id. at 3–4. \n57.  In 2016, Deepwater Wind submitted its Site Assessment Plan4 to BOEM for lease \nOCS-A 0486, and BOEM approved it the next year.5 \n \n2 BOEM, Record of Decision for Revolution Wind Farm and Revolution Wind Export Cable Project \nConstruction and Operations Plan (Aug. 21, 2023), \nhttps://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/Revolution-Wind-\nRecord-of-Decision-OCS-A-0486_Redacted.pdf (Record of Decision).  \n3 BOEM, Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer \nContinental Shelf (Oct. 1, 2013), https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-\nenergy/state-activities/2013-10-01-OCS-A-0487-Lease.pdf. \n4 Deepwater Wind, Site Assessment Plan Deepwater Wind North Lease OCS-A 0486 (Apr. 2016), \nhttps://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/renewable-energy-program/State-Activities/RI/2016-11-\n16_Deepwater_North-Lease-SAP_Final_Clean-%281%29.pdf.  \n5 James F.

In 2018, Ørsted acquired Deepwater Wind.6  \n59.  In  2020,  BOEM  approved  splitting  the  lease  to  accommodate  two  projects: \nRevolution Wind and the South Fork Wind Farm. Record of Decision at 3. Revolution Wind took \n83,000 acres (OCS-A 0486) and the remaining 13,000 acres were devoted to South Fork (OCS-A \n0517). Record of Decision at 3. \n60.  Later in 2020, Ørsted submitted a proposed Construction and Operations Plan for \nthe Project.7  \n61.  In April 2021, BOEM published a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental \nImpact Statement for Revolution Wind. Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact \nStatement for Revolution Wind LLC’s Proposed Wind Energy Facility Offshore Rhode Island, 86 \nFed.  Reg.  22972  (Apr.  30,  2021).  Rhode  Island’s  Coastal  Resources  Management  Council \n(CRMC) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) collaborated \nwith BOEM to produce the Environmental Impact Statement.8 \n62.  In 2022, BOEM published a Draft Environmental Impact Statement.9 BOEM \naccepted public comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement and held three virtual \npublic meetings. Several state entities submitted comments on the Draft Environmental Impact \nStatement, including the Connecticut Port Authority, the University of Connecticut, RIDEM, \nCRMC, and the Rhode Island Historic Preservation and Heritage Commission. \n \n6 See Ørsted, Ørsted acquires Deepwater Wind and creates leading U.S. offshore wind platform (Aug. 12, \n2018), https://orsted.com/en/company-announcement-list/2018/10/1819975.  \n7 Deepwater Wind, Revolution Wind Farm Construction and Operations Plan (Mar. 2020), \nhttps://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/revolution-wind-farm-construction-and-\noperations-plan.  \n8 See Revolution Wind Final EIS, https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/revolution-\nwind-final-eis.  \n9 BOEM, Revolution Wind Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Aug. 2022), https://www.boem.gov/\nrenewable-energy/state-activities/revolution-wind-deis.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 16 of 44 PageID #: 16\n63.  In 2023, BOEM published the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS).10 In \npreparing  this  report,  the  federal  government  spent  almost  two  and  a  half  years  analyzing \nRevolution Wind’s environmental impact. The 2,800-plus page FEIS “assesses the potential \nbiological, socioeconomic, physical, and cultural impacts that could result from the construction, \noperations and maintenance (O&M), and decommissioning of” Revolution Wind. FEIS at 1-1. \nBOEM considered a range of alternatives and selected a combination of alternatives (labelled the \nPreferred Alternative) that would reduce or mitigate the effects of the Project. \n64.  In August 2023, BOEM, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a joint Record \nof Decision for the Project, approving construction of up to 100 wind turbines within the leased \narea.  Record  of  Decision  at  1,  8.  The  Record  of  Decision  concluded  that  approving  the \nConstruction and Operations Plan, as modified by the Preferred Alternative and proposed terms \nand certain conditions, “would be in accordance with the regulations at 30 CFR part 585 and would \nensure that all the activities on the [Outer Continental Shelf] are carried out in a manner that \nprovides for the factors in subsection 8(p)(4) of OCSLA.” Id. at B-26. Likewise, BOEM found \nthat approving the Project with the selected mitigation measures “is consistent with the duties \nrequired under subsection 8(p)(4) of OCSLA” because it “balances the orderly development of \n[Outer Continental Shelf] renewable energy with the prevention of interference with other uses of \nthe [Outer Continental Shelf] and the protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments.” \nId. at 25.  \n65.  In reaching that conclusion, BOEM considered all twelve factors required under 43 \nU.S.C. § 1337(p)(4), including national security and interference with other reasonable uses of the \n \n10 BOEM, Revolution Wind Final Environmental Impact Statement (July 2023), \nhttps://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/revolution-wind-final-eis. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 17 of 44 PageID #: 17\nOuter Continental Shelf. Neither, BOEM found, would be undermined by Revolution Wind. Id. at \nB-2. \n66.  First, BOEM found Revolution Wind would not undermine national security. \nBOEM, in consultation with the Department of Defense, found that any national security impacts \nfrom developing offshore wind in the Revolution Wind project’s lease area “would be negligible \nand avoidable.” Id. at B-15–B-16. Likewise, before approving the Construction and Operation \nPlan, BOEM consulted with the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Air Force, North American Aerospace \nDefense Command, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). \nId. at B-15. \n67.  To mitigate any national security concerns, BOEM and the Department of Defense \nconditioned their approval on Ørsted agreeing to “specific mitigation measures” for the Project. \nThose measures required Ørsted to notify North American Aerospace Defense Command when \nthe Project was nearing completion so that it could complete a Radar Adverse Impact Management \nassessment, for which Ørsted would contribute $80,000. Id. at B-16. Ørsted similarly was required \nto coordinate  with the  Department of Defense before using “distributed fiber-optic sensing \ntechnology as part of the Project or associated transmission cables.” Id. at B-16. \n68.  Second, BOEM found that Revolution Wind would “not unreasonably interfere \nwith other uses of the [Outer Continental Shelf].” Id. at B-18. After assessing nearby ports and \nshipping lanes, BOEM concluded that primary vessel traffic is outside the Project’s area. Id. at B-\n19. BOEM’s navigation risk assessment also confirmed that fishing vessels can safely navigate \nthrough the lease area. See id. Most fisheries also derive less than 1% of their income from the \nProject area. See id. at B-21. Any impact on aviation would be minimal too because more than \n90% of air traffic occurs at altitudes unaffected by the wind turbines. See id. at B-20. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 18 of 44 PageID #: 18\n69.  BOEM adopted mitigation measures to minimize Revolution Wind’s marginal \nimpacts. BOEM required compliance with all FAA marking and lighting standards to mitigate \naviation risks. Id. It also required Revolution Wind to coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard to \nimplement a mariner communication plan. Id. Requiring the wind turbines to be installed in a \nuniform grid pattern also ensured “functional equivalent of numerous navigation corridors” for \ntransit and fishing boats. Id. at B-19. Finally, to mitigate any lost fishing revenue, Revolution Wind \nwill establish “compensation/mitigation funds” totaling over $19,000,000. Id. at B-22.  \n70.  With these mitigation measures in place, BOEM approved Revolution Wind’s \nConstruction and Operations Plan in November 2023, allowing construction of the Project to \nproceed.11 \nIII.  Rhode Island Permitting and Approval of Revolution Wind \n \n71.  Revolution Wind secured all Rhode Island state permits and licenses required for \nconstruction and operation with respect to its facility. \n72.  In February 2023, Rhode Island’s CRMC approved Revolution Wind’s Application \nto Construct and Maintain Two 23 Mile Submarine Export Cables through the West Passage of \nNarragansett Bay to the Cable Landing Location in North Kingstown and Other Associated \nFacilities. The CRMC found that the Revolution Wind project “does not have a reasonable \nprobability of causing a detrimental impact upon the coastal resources of the State of Rhode \nIsland.” \n \n11 Karen Baker, BOEM Office of Renewable Energy Programs, Letter to Peter Allen, Revolution Wind \nLLC (Nov. 17, 2023), https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-\nactivities/COP%20Appv%20Ltr_REV%20OCS-A%200486.pdf.  \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 19 of 44 PageID #: 19\n73.  In  May  2023,  CRMC  completed  its  Coastal  Zone  Management Act  federal \nconsistency review and issued a concurrence, finding the Revolution Wind project is consistent \nand complies with the enforceable policies of Rhode Island’s approved management program.  \n74.  Revolution Wind additionally applied for and received all required RIDEM water \nquality certificates arising from Revolution Wind’s export cable, interconnection facility in North \nKingstown, Rhode Island, and related logistical and operational functions. \n75.  As a major energy facility, Revolution Wind also required Rhode Island licensing \nby the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-98-4. The Energy \nFacility Siting Board approved the facilities associated with Revolution Wind’s connection to the \ntransmission system in Rhode Island and cited, inter alia, that the project served a crucial winter \nreliability need. The Energy Facility Siting Board found that Revolution Wind was cost-justified, \nin that it could be expected to transmit energy at the lowest reasonable cost to the consumer, and \nthat the facility would not cause unacceptable harm to the environment.  \n76.  The Energy Facility Siting Board approved a permit subject to certain conditions \non June 23, 2022. \nIV.  Construction of Revolution Wind \n \n77.  After successfully completing this yearslong state and federal regulatory approval \nprocess, Ørsted and Global Infrastructure Partners’ Skyborn Renewables, another developer, \njointly began developing the Project.  \n78.  Construction began in 2023 and is now approximately 80% complete. All offshore \nfoundations are installed and approximately 70% (45 of 65) of its turbines are in place. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 20 of 44 PageID #: 20\n79.  The submerged array cables have been installed at 34 of the 65 wind turbine sites. \nThe utility export cable has 84 of the 85 miles installed. One of the two offshore wind utility \nsubstations on a monopile foundation has been installed in federal waters.  \n80.  Over 90% of the physical construction has been substantially completed at the \nmainland interconnection site at the Quonset Development Business Park in North Kingstown, \nRhode Island, where the power will be delivered into the regional energy system from the \nRevolution Wind project.  \n81.  The Project is expected to reach commercial operation in 2026. Revolution Wind \nwill deliver enough electricity to the New England grid to power 350,000 homes in Connecticut \nand Rhode Island, the equivalent of 2.5% of the region’s electricity grid.  \nV.  President Trump’s Wind Memorandum and the BOEM Acting Director’s Stop \nWork Order \n \n82.  On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a memorandum that halted all federal \napprovals  necessary  for  the  development  of  offshore  and  onshore  wind  energy.  Temporary \nWithdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review \nof the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects, 90 Fed. Reg. \n8363 (Jan. 29, 2025) (Wind Memo). \n83.  Section 1 of the Wind Memo prohibits “consideration of any area in the [Outer \nContinental Shelf] for any new or renewed wind energy leasing.” See id. It notes, however, that \n“[n]othing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas.” Id.  \n84.  Section 2 of the Wind Memo states that the Interior Secretary and the heads of all \nother relevant agencies “shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, \nor loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a comprehensive \nassessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices.” Id. at 8364. Without \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 21 of 44 PageID #: 21\nciting any evidence, the Wind Memo asserts that this assessment is needed “[i]n light of various \nalleged legal deficiencies underlying the Federal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore \nand offshore wind projects, the consequences of which may lead to grave harm . . . and in light of \npotential inadequacies in various environmental reviews required by the National Environmental \nPolicy Act to lease or permit wind projects.” Id. at 8363–64. \n85.  On August 22, 2025, BOEM’s Acting Director Matthew Giacona issued a Stop \nWork Order to Ørsted. The Order directed it “to halt all ongoing activities related to the Revolution \nWind Project on the [Outer Continental Shelf] to allow time for [BOEM] to address concerns that \nhave arisen during the review that the Department is undertaking pursuant to [the Wind Memo].” \nEx. A. \n86.  The Order states: \nBOEM is acting to ensure that all activities authorized under the Outer Continental \nShelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. §§ 1331 et seq., and the implementing regulations at 30 \nC.F.R. Part 585 are carried out in a manner that provides for protection of the \nenvironment, among other requirements. 43 U.S.C. § 1337(p)(4); 30 C.F.R. § \n585.102(a). In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the \nprotection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of \ninterference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, \nand the territorial seas, as described in that subsection of OCSLA. Id. The BOEM \nDirector is taking this action to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Part \n585 regulations and applicable law. \n \nId. \n87.  BOEM did not characterize the Stop Work Order as a cessation order, a notice of \nnoncompliance, or a lease suspension. It stated that Ørsted could appeal the decision under 30 \nC.F.R. § 585.118.  \n88.  Upon receiving the Stop Work Order, Ørsted immediately suspended construction \nactivities for the Revolution Wind offshore wind project.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 22 of 44 PageID #: 22\n89.  The Stop Work Order threatens the viability of Revolution Wind. The wind energy \nindustry operates in a tremendously complex logistical and regulatory environment, where even \nminor setbacks can dramatically increase costs, leading to projects being severely delayed and \neven abandoned. Thus, the Stop Work Order represents an existential threat to Revolution Wind. \nThe longer the Stop Work Order remains in place, the less likely it is that the Project will be \nconstructed and come to fruition. \nVI.  Other Federal Developments \n90.  The same day the Wind Memo was issued, President Trump declared a “National \nEnergy  Emergency,”  purportedly  brought  on  by  the  country’s  alleged  “insufficient  energy \nproduction,” to shore up the “inadequate energy supply” by facilitating the development of “a \nreliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy.” Executive Order 14156, Declaring a \nNational Energy Emergency, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (Jan. 20, 2025) (Energy Emergency Memo). \n91.  In response to the Energy Emergency Memo, on April 23, 2025, DOI announced it \n“will implement emergency permitting procedures to accelerate the development of domestic \nenergy resources.”12 As part of these procedures, DOI “will be adopting an alternative National \nEnvironmental  Policy Act  compliance  process  to  allow  for  more  concise  documents  and  a \ncompressed timeline.” Under the compressed timeline, “[p]rojects requiring a full environmental \nimpact statement, typically a two-year process, will be reviewed in roughly 28 days.” \n92.  On April 14, 2025, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) \nissued a report that describes “the mechanisms [BOEM], in coordination with other agencies, has \nin place to oversee offshore wind energy development and to what extent they address potential \n \n12 DOI, Department of the Interior Implements Emergency Permitting Procedures to Strengthen Domestic \nEnergy Supply (Apr. 23, 2025), https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/department-interior-implements-\nemergency-permitting-procedures-strengthen-domestic.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 23 of 44 PageID #: 23\nimpacts.”13  GAO  found  that  “BOEM  obtains  input  from  multiple  federal  agencies,  state \ngovernments, Tribes, and other stakeholders to identify and mitigate potential impacts of offshore \nwind energy projects.” GAO Report at 29. The report also noted that “BOEM requires . . . that \noffshore wind developers take steps to mitigate potential adverse environmental impacts.” Id. at \n31. GAO did not find any programmatic failures regarding BOEM’s environmental analysis and \nmitigation of offshore wind projects. \n93.  Meanwhile, the federal government has been defending its approval of Revolution \nWind in litigation brought by several environmental advocacy groups. See Green Oceans v. Dep’t \nof the Interior, No. 1:24-cv-00141-RCL (D.D.C); Se. Lighthouse Foundation v. Haaland, No. \n1:23-cv-03515-RCL (D.D.C); Pres. Society of Newport County v. Haaland, No. 1:23-cv-03513-\nRCL (D.D.C.). In that litigation, the Agency Defendants acknowledged that their review of \nRevolution Wind “culminated in thousands of pages of thorough environmental analysis and \nyielded a comprehensive suite of measures to avoid and minimize any negative impacts to marine \nspecies and habitats.” Green Oceans, Dkt. No. 38, at 1 (government defendants’ memorandum in \nopposition to plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction); id. at 8 (“BOEM considered and \nbalanced a wide range of environmental concerns.”). Those cases remain ongoing as of the filing \nof this complaint.  \nVII.  The Order Significantly Harms the States and their Residents. \n \na.  The Stop Work Order Harms the States’ Energy Interests. \n \n94.  Connecticut and Rhode Island have a strong interest in the timely completion of \nRevolution Wind. As detailed above, the States selected Revolution Wind to provide electricity \nand Renewable Energy Certificates, through contracts with electric distribution companies, to help \n \n13 GAO, Offshore Wind Energy, Actions Needed to Address Gaps in Interior’s Oversight of Development \n52 (Apr. 2025), https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-106998.pdf (GAO Report). \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 24 of 44 PageID #: 24\nmeet their energy needs and RPS requirements. Revolution Wind was supposed to begin delivering \npower and Renewable Energy Certificates to Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the New England \nregional grid in the second half of 2026. \n95.  Revolution  Wind  would  supply  enough  power  to  meet  about  2.5%  of  New \nEngland’s electricity load. Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New England’s independent regional \ngrid operator, ISO-NE, have been counting on Revolution Wind to come online to contribute to \ngrid reliability. Without the power from Revolution Wind, the region’s reserve power margin is \nestimated to drop from 14.8% to 12.2%. This impairs the grid operator’s ability to meet power \ndemand during peak periods such as heat waves and cold snaps. \n96.  On August 25, 2025, in response to the Stop Work Order, ISO-NE warned that \ndelaying the Revolution Wind project would “increase risks to reliability,” including potential \n“near-term impacts to reliability in the summer and winter peak periods,” and “adversely affect \nNew England’s economy and industrial growth.”14 ISO-NE also stated that “[u]npredictable risks \nand  threats  to  resources—regardless  of  technology—that  have  made  significant  capital \ninvestments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, \nincrease costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy \nnow and in the future.” \n97.  Analysis by ISO-NE shows the importance of bringing offshore wind online for \nregional reliability, particularly during the winter months, which is when the New England grid \nfaces its greatest reliability challenges. While offshore wind projects provide energy throughout \nthe year, they perform especially well in the winter. \n \n14 ISO-NE, Statement on Revolution Wind Stop Work Order (Aug. 25, 2025), \nhttps://isonewswire.com/2025/08/25/iso-ne-statement-on-revolution-wind-stop-work-order/. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 25 of 44 PageID #: 25\n98.  Performance in the winter is critical because that is when energy demand in New \nEngland spikes and natural gas supplies are tight due to increased demand for, and prioritization \nof, natural gas for heating. When spikes occur, there is less fuel reserve, and an insufficient amount \nof reserve can lead to rolling blackouts. Rolling blackouts also occur in the summer because of \nhigh energy demand for cooling.  \n99.  ISO-NE’s analysis shows that offshore wind can help reduce reliance on natural gas \nand other fossil fuels, helping to prevent fuel shortages, reduce price volatility, and strengthen grid \nreliability—again, especially during the winter. Operational data from South Fork Wind, which is \nthe first commercial-scale offshore wind project operating in the United States and is also located \nin the Rhode Island/Massachusetts Wind Energy Area, show that this project’s output has been \nhighest during the winter. \n100.  The winter output from Revolution Wind will, if it is not crippled by this indefinite \nhalt to its operations, provide a steady baseload of energy. This will allow more gas and oil to be \nreserved to support spikes in energy consumption, such as when heating fuel supply is constrained.  \n101.  Along with the States’ general interests in ensuring the reliability of New England’s \nregional electric grid, of which the States are a part, Connecticut specifically is counting on the \n304 MW share of Revolution Wind to meet 5% of its electric distribution company load once the \nproject comes online in 2026. \n102.  In Rhode Island, the annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from Revolution \nWind is projected to be approximately 102,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, a 10% reduction \nfor the Rhode Island Electric Power Consumption sector. \n103.  There is no ready substitute for Revolution Wind in the timeframe that the Project \nis expected to come online. If the indefinite halt prevents Revolution Wind’s completion, the States \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 26 of 44 PageID #: 26\nwill be without a vital energy source they were relying on to meet their increasing demands and \nwill be without any reliable substitute option. \n104.  Once operational, Revolution Wind will also yield substantial cost savings to the \nStates’ ratepayers and to the States themselves, which also purchase electricity. The Revolution \nWind contracts are expected to act as a hedge against rising electricity rates. Direct savings to \nratepayers from the contracts are estimated to be hundreds of millions of dollars over 20 years due \nto the fixed contract prices for Revolution Wind. The contract prices are lower than the average \nprojected cost of energy and Renewable Energy Certificates over this period. \n105.  By  providing  a  new  source  of  low-marginal  cost  power  in  New  England, \nRevolution Wind will further cause wholesale energy and capacity market costs in ISO-NE to be \nlower, providing additional indirect cost savings to ratepayers in Connecticut and Rhode Island, \nincluding the States’ themselves. These indirect electric bill cost savings will apply to all purchases \nof energy and capacity in the ISO-NE markets that are needed to meet energy demand in the States. \nRegionally, these wholesale market benefits from Revolution Wind are expected to be in the \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year, of which approximately 25% of the benefits will accrue \nto Connecticut ratepayers, based on its share of total regional load. \n106.  If BOEM’s Stop Work Order prevents the fully permitted Revolution Wind project \nfrom entering service in 2026 as planned, Connecticut and Rhode Island ratepayers would not \nreceive the benefits of these direct and indirect electric bill savings. The result instead would be \ntens of millions of dollars in higher electricity costs on average for ratepayers each year. The \npotential cost to ratepayers and to the States’ economies could be much higher, because, as ISO-\nNE has warned, the loss or delay of Revolution Wind “will increase risks to reliability” in the \nregion. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 27 of 44 PageID #: 27\n107.  In sum, the energy from power purchase agreements with Revolution Wind that the \nStates have relied on receiving starting in 2026 will not be available at the time the States \nanticipated. The longer the indefinite delay in the construction of Revolution Wind persists, the \nlonger the States will need to make up for that loss of energy. Delays additionally risk less \nfavorable contracts for replacement energy and ultimate cost increases for ratepayers.  \nb.  The Stop Work Order Harms the States’ Economic and Contractual Interests. \n \n108.  To support Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects, Connecticut has \ninvested in facilities, including the redeveloped Connecticut State Pier Terminal in New London. \nConnecticut has spent over $200,000,000 to redevelop the State Pier Terminal into a world-class \nheavy-lift  maritime  facility  and  hub  for  offshore  wind. The Terminal  is  one  of  only  three \nmarshaling facilities on the East Coast that are assembling offshore wind turbines for deployment \nand was the first one with open ocean access.  \n109.  The State Pier Terminal is leased to Ørsted, which is using it to construct Revolution \nWind. The financial impact to Ørsted resulting from the indefinite halt to the construction \nultimately impacts the Connecticut Port Authority’s lease agreement. \n110.  The Revolution Wind project supports approximately 1,200 jobs in Connecticut and \nRhode Island. At the State Pier Terminal, more than 100 jobs are tied directly to staging and \nassembly for offshore wind.  \n111.  An indefinite halt to the Project will impact the employment of the 1,200 people \nliving and working in Connecticut and Rhode Island. If those people become unemployed, the \nStates will experience negative financial and social repercussions.  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 28 of 44 PageID #: 28\n112.  An indefinite halt to the Project will cause the States to expend resources, which \nwere already expended once, to follow their statutory mandates for procurement of an appropriate \nreplacement to the power purchased from the Revolution Wind Project.  \n113.  The indefinite halt has immediate impacts on the States’ interests in this sector of \nthe economy. The Stop Work Order is also likely to undermine investor confidence and set a \nchilling  precedent  for  future  projects. This  type  of  shock  to  the  industry  hurts  the  States’ \ninvestments to support this industry and damages the credibility of regional energy markets.  \n114.  In Rhode Island, the same fiscal consequences are present in a future without \nRevolution Wind.  Revolution Wind is expected to generate $87,000,000 in energy market price \nreductions over the next two decades. \n115.  The Stop Work Order also harms Rhode Island’s economic interests by depriving \nits energy customers of the benefits of a clear and known contracted-for cost of renewable energy \nthat was reviewed and approved by Rhode Island’s Public Utilities Commission. \n116.  The  Revolution  Wind  project  supports  over  2,500  jobs  nationwide  in  the \nconstruction, operations, shipbuilding and manufacturing sectors, including over 1,000 union \nconstruction jobs. The Revolution Wind project, once completed, is expected to generate 86 full-\ntime jobs and $8,120,000 as an annual increase in Rhode Island’s GDP. \n117.  The Community College of Rhode Island has provided nearly 200 union workers \nanticipating this federal and state approved project in the offshore wind industry.  \n118.  Ørsted signed the first-ever U.S. offshore wind helicopter agreement for new crew \nhelicopters, including a $1,800,000 investment in Quonset State Airport where the helicopters are \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 29 of 44 PageID #: 29\nbased. Rhode Island shipyards built five crew vessels to support Revolution Wind and other \ninstallations during and after its construction.15 \n119.  Rhode Island’s efforts to build a strong local offshore wind industry are thwarted \nby the instability and risk created by the federal government’s arbitrary halt to a fully permitted \nand nearly complete project.   \n120.  Rhode Island will suffer economic harm if the Stop Work Order remains in place, \nincluding lost benefits from investments made by Rhode Island to facilitate the infrastructure \nneeded to support Revolution Wind, and significant lost tax revenue should the offshore wind \nindustry that Rhode Island has encouraged and developed ultimately leave Rhode Island.  \nc.  The  Stop  Work  Order  Imperils  Compliance  with  State  Mandates  for \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions and Renewable Portfolio Standards.  \n \n121.  The Stop Work Order  undermines the States’  ability to procure energy from \noffshore wind generation as needed to meet the States’ energy and environmental requirements, \nincluding statutory requirements to reduce in-state greenhouse-gas-emitting sources of power.  \n122.  Connecticut mandates that electric distribution companies must demonstrate that a \npercentage of their output or services is generated by renewable energy sources. See Conn. Gen. \nStat. § 16-245a. The Commissioner ensures that the distribution companies can comply with this \nmandate by reviewing Requests for Proposal and choosing the suppliers, which enter into contracts \nwith the distribution companies. The indefinite halt to Revolution Wind endangers the distribution \ncompanies’ ability to comply with 2026’s mandate. See id. § 16-245a(a)(21). \n123.  Connecticut also has mandatory emission reductions targets that will be impacted \nnegatively by an indefinite halt to the Revolution Wind project. By 2030, Connecticut must reduce \n \n15 Ørsted, Press Release (Jan. 27, 2022), https://us.orsted.com/news-archive/2022/01/rhode-island-\nshipyards-to-build-five-new-offshore-wind-crew-vessels. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 30 of 44 PageID #: 30\nthe levels of greenhouse gas emitted to a level at least 45% below the level emitted in 2001. Id. § \n22a-200a. Connecticut is counting on Revolution Wind to meet that goal, and the indefinite halt to \nthe Project undermines Connecticut’s ability to meet that climate goal.  \n124.   The 2020 Integrated Resources Plan, which is a statutorily mandated review of \nConnecticut’s energy outlook, see id. § 16-3a, lists the Revolution Wind as a significant contributor \nto achieving Connecticut’s RPS and greenhouse gas reduction goals. The power purchase contracts \nthe distribution companies entered into to obtain supply from the Revolution Wind project were \nexecuted  beginning  in  2018.  Revolution  Wind  has  been  so  thoroughly  integrated  into  the \nConnecticut’s  planning  about  RPS  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  that  Connecticut  has \nexperienced immediate harm by the prospect that Revolution Wind may not be timely completed \ndue to the immediate halt of operations to the Project.    \n125.  There is not an immediate and obvious replacement for the energy that Revolution \nWind was going to supply to Connecticut. Revolution Wind was chosen for a reason—it was the \nbest way to reduce costs for ratepayers, comply with RPS mandates, and ensure a long-term stable \nenergy source. The multi-year process that Connecticut engaged in before selecting Revolution \nWind cannot be recreated in a timely fashion.  \n126.  Connecticut faces immediate uncertainty in the future composition of its energy \ncomposition resulting from the indefinite halt of Revolution Wind. Revolution Wind has been \ncounted on to meet Connecticut’s future energy needs, greenhouse-gas reduction goals and RPS \nobjectives for seven years. Suddenly removing it through an indefinite halt to the Project leaves \nConnecticut’s energy future uncertain.   \n127.  In Rhode Island, the Stop Work Order undermines the State’s efforts to diversify its \nenergy supply and enhance grid resiliency and capacity. This includes efforts to comply with \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 31 of 44 PageID #: 31\nstatutory mandates set by Rhode Island’s legislature in the RI RES and Rhode Island’s 2021 Act \non Climate. \n128.  As of July 2022, Rhode Island has identified approximately 1,149 MW of clean \nenergy  generation  capacity.  Nearly  35%  of  what  Rhode  Island  has  been  able  to  secure  in \nfurtherance of its energy and climate goals comes from counting on the 400 MW from the \nRevolution Wind facility. \n129.  Rhode Island is relying on the 400 MW from Revolution Wind and the long-term \nnegotiated pricing to cost-effectively comply with the requirements under the RI RES. There is no \nreadily-known alternative to this renewable energy. \n130.  As outlined in Rhode Island’s 2022 Climate Update, Revolution Wind is expected \nto reduce Rhode Island’s greenhouse gas emissions by a very significant 11 million metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide. Without this reduction, it will become much more difficult for Rhode Island to \ncomply with its Act on Climate greenhouse gas emission reduction mandates. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act - 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n(Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n131.  The States incorporate by reference the above allegations.  \n132.  DOI, Interior Secretary Burgum, BOEM, and BOEM Acting Director Giacona \n(collectively, Agency Defendants) are “agenc[ies]” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n133.  Agency  Defendants  have  ordered  Ørsted  to  indefinitely  halt  construction  of \nRevolution Wind. This order constitutes final agency action subject to an APA challenge because \nit “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and is an action “from \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 32 of 44 PageID #: 32\nwhich legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (internal \nquotations omitted); see 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \n134.  The Stop Work Order marks the end of the Agency Defendants’ decision-making \nbecause  it  halts  construction  on  Revolution  Wind,  even  if  only  temporarily.  The Agency \nDefendants are not still debating whether to pause the Project—they have done so. They cannot \nnow avoid judicial review by suggesting they might later reconsider their final decision. See, e.g., \nNRDC v. Wheeler, 955 F.3d 68, 80 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (“[A]s long as an agency has completed its \ndecisionmaking on a challenged rule—even one interim in nature—the rule satisfies the first prong \nof the finality test.”). \n135.  Legal consequences also unquestionably flow from the Stop Work Order, which \n“affects regulated parties’ rights or obligations” and threatens imminent harm to the States for all \nthe reasons detailed above. Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178. There also will be consequences if Ørsted \nfails to comply with the Stop Work Order. BOEM threatened to “take additional corrective action” \nif Ørsted continues work on Revolution Wind, citing the regulation that gives it authority to impose \ncivil penalties on noncomplying companies. As such, the Stop Work Order constitutes a final \nagency action.  \n136.  When presented with a final agency action, the APA requires that a court “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary [or] capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A). \n137.  An  agency  action  is  arbitrary  or  capricious  where  it  is  not  “reasonable  and \nreasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). An agency \nmust provide “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 33 of 44 PageID #: 33\nMut. Auto. Ins., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). “A command in an \nExecutive  Order  does  not  exempt  an  agency  from  the  APA’s  reasoned  decision-making \nrequirement.” Louisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d 267, 295 (W.D. La. 2022). \n138.  Additionally, agencies must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, \nreasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019). Agencies may not rely on explanations that are “contrived” or \n“incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking \nprocess.” Id.  \n139.  When an agency changes its existing policy, it must “display awareness that it is \nchanging position” and “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.” F.C.C. v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). An agency must provide “a more detailed \njustification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate” when “its new \npolicy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy.” Id. An \n“unexplained inconsistency in agency policy is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an \narbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 \nU.S. 211, 222 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n140.  Finally, agencies also must provide a more detailed justification “when its prior \npolicy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” Fox, 556 U.S. at \n515. \n141.  Here, Agency Defendants have provided no reasoned basis for halting construction \nof the fully permitted  Project, let alone a more detailed justification  that acknowledges or \nreconciles its stark departure from their previous approval and permitting of the Project or the \nsignificant reliance interests that have developed based on that approval and permitting.  \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 34 of 44 PageID #: 34\n142.  The Agency Defendants’ stated justifications for indefinitely halting construction \nof the fully permitted Revolution Wind are not reasoned explanations. BOEM Acting Director \nGiacona said in the Stop Work Order that it is intended to “ensure that all activities” are “carried \nout in a manner that provides for protection of the environment, among other requirements,” and \nthat it “is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the \nUnited States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, \nthe high seas, and the territorial seas, as described in that subsection of OCSLA.” The Stop Work \nOrder, he added, was intended to “ensure compliance with the requirements of Part 585 regulations \nand applicable law.”  \n143.  On their face, these stated justifications do not reflect the reasoned decision-making \nthe APA requires. The Agency Defendants cite the applicable regulatory framework and two \nfactors BOEM must consider when permitting an offshore project like Revolution Wind—national \nsecurity  and  interference  with  other  uses  of  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf. See  43  U.S.C.  § \n1337(p)(4)(F), (I). But the Agency Defendants did not find or reference any facts suggesting that \nthe Project imperils national security or interferes with other Outer Continental Shelf uses. In fact, \nthey did not even mention what their “concerns” with the Project are. Without any factual basis, \nthere is no way to decipher from the Stop Work Order “a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. Even assuming there were legitimate \nconcerns about national security or interference, the Agency Defendants did not bother even trying \nto explain how those concerns justify indefinitely halting construction of a multi-billion dollar, \nfully permitted project. See Louisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d at 295 (finding DOI’s stop work \norder for offshore drilling arbitrary and capricious “[b]ecause no rational explanation was given” \nfor it). \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 35 of 44 PageID #: 35\n144.  The Stop Work Order also is an unexplained reversal of the federal government’s \nprior finding that Revolution Wind satisfies OCSLA’s requirements. Agency Defendants fail to \nexplain  the  stark  departure  from  this  prior  position,  much  less  provide  “a  more  detailed \njustification” to explain its conflicting position, as the APA requires. Encino Motorcars, LLC, 579 \nU.S. at 222. BOEM and other government agencies spent nine years reviewing Revolution Wind, \nculminating in the joint Record of Decision  and a 2,800-page Final Environmental Impact \nStatement approving the Project. Unlike the exhaustive administrative record backing Revolution \nWind’s permits, the Stop Work Order fails to provide any “satisfactory explanation for its action[.]” \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \n145.  The Stop Work Order contradicts not just the Agency Defendants’ past approvals, \nbut also their more recent assertions in the ongoing litigation with environmental advocacy groups \nthat Revolution Wind complies with the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Act. See Defs. \nof Wildlife v. Dep’t of the Interior, 931 F.3d 339, 352 (4th Cir. 2019) (“Absent a reasoned discussion \nof the agency’s apparently contradictory positions . . . we can only conclude that [the agency] acted \narbitrarily.”). The contradictions extend to other federal agencies and actions too. The GAO \nrecently found no programmatic or implementation problems in BOEM’s environmental analyses \nof offshore wind projects. In his Energy Emergency Order, President Trump declared that the \nUnited States is facing an “energy emergency,” which prompted DOI to begin expediting fossil \nfuel projects. None of these actions square with halting Revolution Wind. These “unexplained \ninconsistenc[ies]” between the Stop Work Order and the federal government’s energy policies \nshow that the Stop Work Order is arbitrary and capricious. Encino Motorcars, LLC, 579 U.S. at \n222.  \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 36 of 44 PageID #: 36\n146.  Moreover,  the  administration’s  action  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  it \nundermines the certainty of the federal permitting process. The States and Ørsted have invested in \nthe leasing and permitting of Revolution Wind for nearly a decade and have developed significant \nreliance interests in the project—interests that the Agency Defendants did not consider in issuing \nthe Stop Work Order.  \n147.  The States and other Project stakeholders have relied on the Agency Defendants’ \napprovals for Revolution Wind in making significant policy and financial decisions, including \nwhether to pursue other wind-energy projects. The States are depending on Revolution Wind to \nhelp meet their statutorily required emission-reduction targets and have allocated significant \nagency resources to permitting and contracting related to existing wind-energy projects or with \ntransmission projects intended to serve wind energy. \n148.  The States have invested significant state financial resources in industries and \nProject components associated with building out Revolution Wind.  \n149.  Those  financial  resources  include  Connecticut’s  $210,000,000  investment  in \nupgrading the Connecticut Port Authority’s State Pier Terminal in the Port of New London.  \n150.  In Rhode Island, the public-private partnership includes infrastructure at ProvPort \nand  Quonset  Point,  and  investment  in  job  training  through  Rhode  Island  state  educational \ninstitutions. \n151.  Agency Defendants’ actions ignore and fundamentally harm the States’ significant \nreliance interests. Agency Defendants’ Stop Work Order could “necessitate systemic” or at least \n“significant  change[s]”  to  the  States’  approach  for  supporting  their  growing  energy  needs, \ndiversifying their energy portfolios, and achieving their climate goals. Encino Motorcars, 579 U.S. \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 37 of 44 PageID #: 37\nat 222. Yet Agency Defendants failed to provide “a more detailed justification than what would \nsuffice for a new policy created on a blank slate.” Fox, 556 U.S. at 515. \n152.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a declaration \nthat the Agency Defendants’ Stop Work Order suspending the fully approved and nearly complete \nProject violates the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious. \n153.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706, the States are entitled to vacatur of the Agency Defendants’ \nStop  Work  Order,  as  well  as  a  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  preventing Agency \nDefendants from enforcing the Stop Work Order and taking further unlawful action to block \nRevolution Wind. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act - 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \n(Contrary to Law and Ultra Vires Agency Action) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n154.  The States incorporate by reference the above allegations.  \n155.  An agency may not take any action that exceeds the scope of its statutory authority. \nUnder the APA, a reviewing court must set aside a challenged agency action that is “not in \naccordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or ultra vires, that is, “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n156.  Congress enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might \notherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 391 (2024) (quoting United States v. Morton Salt, \n338 U.S. 632, 644 (1950)).  \n157.  The Stop Work Order is a final agency action, which marks the consummation of \nthe agency’s decision-making process and are actions from which legal consequences will flow. \nSee Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78. \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 38 of 44 PageID #: 38\n158.  The Stop Work Order is untethered from DOI and BOEM’s regulatory authority \nunder OCSLA. Because Agency Defendants’ actions lack authority under OCSLA, they are ultra \nvires. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(C), 706(2)(A).  \n159.  OCSLA grants DOI authority to temporarily prohibit any activity under a wind \nenergy lease, but only if there is “a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or damage to \nlife (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or \nnot leased), or to the marine, coastal, or human environment.” 43 U.S.C. § 1334(a)(1). Here, the \nStop Work Order makes no such finding of any threat.  \n160.  BOEM’s  implementing  regulations  allow  it  to  suspend  a  lease  in  only  two \ncircumstances: (1) “[w]hen necessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting some or all \nactivities under [the] lease” and (2) “[w]hen the suspension is necessary for reasons of national \nsecurity or defense.” 30 C.F.R. § 585.417. This statutory standard relates purely to suspending a \nlease. The Stop Work Order does not purport to suspend the lease, nor could it because there is no \nevidence that suspending the lease is necessary to comply with a judicial decree or protect national \nsecurity. \n161.  The Defendant Agencies have not found that Ørsted violated any of the conditions \nof its lease with BOEM.  \n162.  The BSEE is authorized to halt offshore wind construction, but only (1) when the \nagency has found that the Project is violating “an applicable law; regulation; order; or provision \nof a lease, grant, plan, or BSEE or BOEM approval,” 30 C.F.R. § 285.401(a); (2) “ [w]hen \nnecessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting some or all activities under [the] lease,” 30 \nC.F.R. § 285.417; or (3) “[w]hen continued activities pose an imminent threat of serious or \nirreparable harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 39 of 44 PageID #: 39\nmarine,  coastal,  or  human  environment;  or  sites,  structures,  or  objects  of  historical  or \narchaeological significance,” id. None of these three provisions are even referenced in the Stop \nWork Order.  \n163.  Rather than rely on the specific provisions that allow it to stop construction, \nBOEM’s Stop Work Order cites the generic standard under which the government must review \noffshore wind projects for approval. 43 U.S.C. § 1337(p)(4); 30 C.F.R. § 585.102(a). But this \nstandard does not give BOEM authority to indefinitely halt construction of a fully permitted project \nlike Revolution Wind. Rather, it contains twelve factors that BOEM must considered in authorizing \nrenewable energy activities on the Outer Continental Shelf. Id. BOEM already determined that the \nProject complies with these twelve factors, and cites no facts or law to justify changing course \nnow. Record of Decision at B-2-26. So neither 43 U.S.C. § 1337(p)(4) nor 30 C.F.R. § 585.102(a) \nauthorize the Stop Work Order. \n164.  Moreover, DOI and BOEM’s actions violate their clear mandate to administer \nOCSLA’s  permitting  program  to  promote  “expeditious  and  orderly  development”  of  Outer \nContinental Shelf resources. 43 U.S.C. § 1332. Halting the fully permitted Revolution Wind \nproject without basis is hardly “orderly” administration of OCSLA. \n165.  The Agency Defendants’ Stop Work Order is “not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), and is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right,” id. § 706(2)(C), so it violates the APA as well as the statutory and regulatory \nprovisions cited above. \n166.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a declaration \nthat the Stop Work Order violates APA Sections 706(2)(A) and 706(2)(C). \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 40 of 44 PageID #: 40\n167.  The States are also entitled to vacatur of the Agency Defendants’ Stop Work Order \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nCOUNT III \nOCSLA Citizen Suit - 43 U.S.C. § 1349 \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n168.  The States incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs. \n169.  OCSLA provides that “any person having a valid legal interest which is or may be \nadversely affected may commence a civil action on his own behalf to compel compliance with this \nsubchapter  against  any  person,  including  the  United  States,  and  any  other  government \ninstrumentality or agency (to the extent permitted by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution) \nfor any alleged violation of any provision of this subchapter or any regulation promulgated under \nthis subchapter, or of the terms of any permit or lease issued by the Secretary under this \nsubchapter.” 43 U.S.C. § 1349(a)(1).  \n170.  “The term ‘person’ includes, in addition to a natural person, an association, a State, \na political subdivision of a State, or a private, public, or municipal corporation.” 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1331(d). \n171.  An OCSLA citizen suit may be brought “immediately after notification of the \nalleged violation in any case in which the alleged violation constitutes an imminent threat to the \npublic health or safety or would immediately affect a legal interest of the plaintiff.” 43 U.S.C. \n§ 1349(a)(3). \n172.  The  Stop  Work  Order  immediately  harms  the  States’  legal  interests  in  the \n“expeditious and orderly development,” 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3), of the fully approved Project.  \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 41 of 44 PageID #: 41\n173.  As shown above, the States have invested time and resources into the Project’s \nsuccess and acted in reliance on the planned benefits to the States and their citizens.  \n174.  The States are relying on the energy produced from the Project to help meet their \nemission reduction goals required by state law, to decarbonize their electricity grids, and mitigate  \ngreenhouse-gas emissions to offset the impacts of climate change, which poses a significant threat \nto the wellbeing and stability of the States’ communities and economies. \n175.  The  States  are  further  counting  on  the  Project  to  provide  grid  stability  and \nreliability, economic relief for its citizens facing high electric rates, and continuing employment \nfor approximately 1,200 residents of the States. \n176.  The longer the Stop Work Order is in effect the more likely it is that the Project will \nnot be constructed or the delays in construction will have permanent impacts on the States’ \naforementioned interests. \n177.  The Stop Work Order violates OCSLA because it orders that all work stop on the \nProject without making the necessary finding that either: (1) the Project creates “a threat of serious, \nirreparable, or immediate harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, \nto any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or to the marine, coastal, or human \nenvironment,” 43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(1), or (2) a suspension is “necessary to comply with judicial \ndecrees prohibiting some or all activities under [the] lease” or “is necessary for reasons of national \nsecurity or defense,” 30 C.F.R. § 585.417. \n178.  The Stop Work Order also violates OCSLA and its regulations by ignoring the \nstatute’s clear mandate that DOI and BOEM follow its procedures to administer the Outer \nContinental Shelf leasing and permitting program. \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 42 of 44 PageID #: 42\n179.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the States are entitled to a declaration that the Stop Work \nOrder violates OCSLA because it is inconsistent with the statute and its implementing regulations.  \n180.  The States are also entitled to a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \nfurther unlawful interference with the Project.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, the States respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  Declare  that  the  BOEM Acting  Director’s  Stop Work  Order  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \n2.  Declare that the BOEM Acting Director’s Stop Work Order is in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right and otherwise not in accordance \nwith law in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), (A); \n3.  Declare that the BOEM Acting Director’s Stop Work Order violates OCSLA as \ninconsistent with the statute and its implementing regulations;  \n4.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), order vacatur of the BOEM Acting Director’s Stop Work \nOrder;  \n5.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), preliminarily and permanently enjoin and stay Agency \nDefendants from enforcing the BOEM Acting Director’s Stop Work Order; and \n6.  Grant all other relief as the Court may deem just and proper, including, but not \nlimited to, attorney’s fees and costs.   \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00439     Document 1     Filed 09/04/25     Page 43 of 44 PageID #: 43\nDated: September 4, 2025    PETER F.
