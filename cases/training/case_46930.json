As used herein, \"journalist\" includes any duly authorized representative of any news service, online news service, newspaper, or radio or television station or network. 2. If LAPD or another law enforcement agency establishes a police line or rolling closure at a demonstration, march, protest, or rally where individuals are engaged in activity that is protected pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, LAPD is enjoined from: a. Prohibiting a journalist from entering or remaining in the closed areas. b. Intentionally assaulting, interfering with, or obstructing any journalist who is gathering, receiving, or processing information for communication to the public (including by restricting journalists to areas from which they do not have sufficient opportunity to observe and report on protests, including the interaction between police and protestors). c. Citing, detaining, or arresting a journalist who is in a closed area for failure to disperse, curfew violation, or obstruction of a law enforcement officer for gathering, receiving, or processing information. If LAPD detains or arrest a person who claims to be a journalist, that person shall be permitted to promptly contact a supervisory officer of the rank of captain or above for purposes of challenging that detention, unless circumstances make it impossible to do so. 3. LAPD is further enjoined from using less-lethal munitions (\"LLMs\") and other crowd control weapons (including kinetic impact projectiles (\"KIPs\"), chemical irritants, and flash- bangs) against journalists who are not posing a threat of imminent harm to an officer or another person. 4. Within the next 72 hours, LAPD management is ordered to summarize this Order and disseminate its contents to all LAPD officers responding to a protest in Los Angeles. 5. This Order shall expire fourteen (14) days after its filing, unless otherwise extended by the Court. (lom) (Entered: 07/11/2025)"
