Box 34553   \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nWashington, DC 20043   \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  Case No. \nOFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL \n1730 M Street, N.W., Suite 218 \nWashington, D.C. 20036, \nand \nJAMIESON GREER, in his official capacity \nas Acting Director of the Office of Special \nCounsel, \n1730 M Street, N.W., Suite 218 \nWashington, D.C. 20036. \nDefendants. \nPlaintiffs Civil Servant 1, Civil Servant 2, Civil Servant 3, Civil Servant 4, and Civil \nServant 5, proceeding under pseudonyms,1 bring this action against the Office of Special Counsel \n(OSC) and the Acting Director of OSC. They allege as follows:  \n1. Congress created OSC to protect federal employees from unlawful employment\nactions.  In February 2025, OSC did exactly that—it worked to stop the Trump Administration \nfrom illegally firing thousands of federal employees. So President Trump decided to remake OSC. \nHe attacked its independence, fired the then-Special Counsel, and installed a White House loyalist \nas the new head of OSC. Unsurprisingly, OSC then reversed course, effectively telling the \n1 Plaintiffs’ motion to proceed under pseudonyms is forthcoming. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 2 of 40\nterminated employees that OSC would no longer protect them.  But OSC’s actions were plainly \nillegal—OSC failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its abrupt reversal, and, more important, \nit disregarded its statutory obligation to protect federal employees from unlawful employment \nactions. Congress mandated that OSC serve as an independent safeguard to protect federal \nemployees and preserve the federal government’s merit-based system. Plaintiffs now bring this \ncase to compel OSC to follow this mandate.  \n2.  OSC is obligated to protect federal employees from retaliation and prohibited \npersonnel practices (PPPs). PPPs are employment-related activities that are banned in the federal \nworkforce because they undermine the government’s statutorily-mandated commitment to a non-\npartisan civil service premised on merit principles. OSC is charged with investigating these \nprohibited practices, including actions like firing or demoting someone for political reasons, \npunishing whistleblowers, showing favoritism, or violating merit-based hiring and firing rules. \nOSC is the only agency with the authority to investigate and prosecute PPPs across the executive \nbranch. \n3.  OSC’s jurisdiction—as set out by Congress—includes all covered executive branch \nemployees,  including  the  approximately  200,000  probationary  employees,  new  hires,  and \nemployees moving into new positions who are undergoing a one- or two-year trial period to assess \ntheir fitness for the job. \n4.  From its inception, and prior to the Trump Administration’s hostile takeover of \nOSC, the agency worked to safeguard the non-partisan civil service and protect federal employees \nand applicants from PPPs.   \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 3 of 40\n5.  In February 2025, to cull the civil service of workers hired or promoted during the \nBiden Administration, the Trump Administration directed the terminations of thousands of these \nprobationary federal employees governmentwide. These firings were conducted en masse, with no \nindividualized assessments of workers’ performance or conduct. These mass firings violated \nfederal regulations and core merit system principles codified in statute and designed to ensure the \nintegrity of the non-partisan career civil service. \n6.  More than 2,000 probationary employees filed complaints with OSC, describing \nhow their terminations constituted PPPs. OSC initially agreed there was evidence of PPPs. The \nthen Senate-confirmed Special Counsel, Hampton Dellinger, immediately acted to protect these \ncivil servants. He launched investigations and issued public statements affirming OSC’s statutory \nrole. \n7.  OSC also successfully petitioned the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the \nadjudicatory body for most federal personnel-related claims, to stay many of those terminations. \nOSC did so because it properly determined that these mass probationary terminations were in fact \nreductions in force, or RIFs—a means of reducing or reorganizing the federal workforce—but \nwere implemented in violation of numerous statutes and regulations, making them unlawful PPPs.  \n8.  But OSC’s work was short-lived. Rather than respect OSC’s independence and \nDellinger’s fixed term, which was not set to expire until 2029, the Trump Administration fired \nDellinger without cause. Following Dellinger’s removal, the Trump Administration installed a \nseries of political loyalists as Acting Special Counsels. In April 2025, just weeks after Dellinger’s \nouster, OSC abruptly reversed course and abdicated its statutory duty to protect employees from \npartisan and unlawful actions. Just weeks after securing stays from the MSPB based on OSC’s \nsound legal argument that these probationary terminations constituted PPPs, OSC issued a poorly \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 4 of 40\nreasoned directive (the “Probationary Directive”) explicitly reversing its position and ordering \nagency  staff  to  close  these  investigations.  This  about  face  violated  settled  principles  of \nadministrative law and OSC’s statutory duties under title 5 of the U.S. Code, and sent a chilling \nmessage  to  federal  workers  that  OSC—a  formerly  independent  agency—was  now  directly \ncontrolled by the White House and that protections granted by Congress to probationary employees \ncould and would be set aside for political expediency.  \n9.  The Probationary Directive was arbitrary and capricious in numerous respects. The \nProbationary Directive failed to adequately explain the agency’s stark reversal in position, ignored \nthe reliance interests of probationary employees that had filed valid complaints in good faith, and \ndepends on a misreading of OSC’s statutory authority. And it was plainly pretextual—cloaking \npolitical interference in the civil service under the guise of (flawed) legal interpretation. The \nProbationary Directive was also contrary to law. The OSC is obligated to investigate allegations \nof PPPs, including those alleged by employees serving in their probationary periods, and those \nrelating to unlawful RIFs.  \n10.  The consequences of the Probationary Directive were immediate and severe. OSC \nclosed the more than 2,000 complaints (the “Closure Notices”), denying these employees any \nmeaningful review.  \n11.  Plaintiffs  are  among  those  probationary  employees  who  received  termination \nnotices in February 2025 as part of the Administration’s effort to cull the civil service. Plaintiffs \nwere model federal employees who sought to serve their country and were selected to their \npositions because of their skill and dedication to their agencies’ missions. They excelled in their \npositions and received strong early performance evaluations. None were accused of misconduct or \npoor performance. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 5 of 40\n12.  Plaintiffs turned to OSC for protection against unlawful PPPs. They filed timely \ncomplaints with OSC asserting that their removal was a PPP. OSC initially acknowledged their \ncomplaints. And each Plaintiff was harmed when their complaint was closed summarily following \nthe unlawful Probationary Directive. \n13.  Plaintiffs do not challenge OSC’s discretion to resolve individual complaints on the \nmerits. They challenge instead OSC’s unlawful, ill-explained policy and its categorical exclusion \nof an entire class of cases, those involving probationary employees, from consideration. That \npolicy lacks any statutory basis, is an abdication of OSC’s legal mandate, and violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff Civil Servant 1 is proceeding under a pseudonym. She was a Biologist in \nthe Anchorage Field Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \nwithin the U.S. Department of Commerce. Civil Servant 1 provided logistical, technical, and safety \nsupport for NOAA scientists deployed at sea, maintained field safety equipment, reviewed post-\ndeployment data, and verified safety and enforcement reports. Supervisors repeatedly affirmed \nthat she was meeting or exceeding expectations and intended to retain her beyond her probationary \nperiod. Yet on or about February 27, 2025, NOAA terminated her at the direction of the White \nHouse and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management without notice of performance deficiencies \nor misconduct. She filed a complaint with OSC in March 2025 alleging that her termination was a \nPPP under 5 U.S.C. § 2302. OSC acknowledged receipt, but issued a pre-closure letter in early \nMay 2025, following the Probationary Directive, and then formally closed her complaint on May \n13, 2025. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 6 of 40\n15.  Plaintiff Civil Servant 2 is proceeding under a pseudonym. He is a 100% disabled \nveteran  who  held  multiple  civilian  federal  positions  before  joining  the  General  Services \nAdministration (GSA) in late 2024. Due to a break in service, he was required to serve a new \nprobationary period. He quickly earned an “Above Fully Successful” mid-year performance rating. \nOn February 6, 2025, GSA managers informed probationary employees that positions were at risk \ndue to the President’s direction to cut staff. Days later, Civil Servant 2 received a formal \ntermination letter stating it was not “in the best interest of the government” to retain him but cited \nno performance or misconduct issues. He filed a complaint with OSC in March 2025 alleging that \nhis termination was a PPP under 5 U.S.C. § 2302. OSC acknowledged receipt, but following the \nProbationary Directive, it closed the complaint on May 23, 2025. Due to a series of court-imposed \ninjunctions related to other litigation, he was briefly reinstated after initially being terminated in \nFebruary 2025, but he was then terminated (again) in July 2025. \n16.  Plaintiff  Civil  Servant  3  is  proceeding  under  a  pseudonym.  She  joined  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families, in \nMay 2024 as a Senior Policy Advisor. She had received an “Outstanding” performance rating and \nwas repeatedly praised for her leadership in interagency initiatives. Nevertheless, in February \n2025, she received a memorandum informing her that she was being terminated and would be \nplaced on administrative leave, effective immediately, and that termination would be effective on \nMarch 14, 2025, despite no record of poor performance or misconduct. She filed a complaint with \nOSC in March 2025 alleging that her termination was a PPP under 5 U.S.C. § 2302. OSC \nacknowledged receipt, but following the Probationary Directive, it closed the complaint in May \n2025. Plaintiff Civil Servant 3 remained on administrative leave until June 2025 when she departed \nfrom her position.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 7 of 40\n17.  Plaintiff Civil Servant 4 is proceeding under a pseudonym. She is an environmental \nscience professional who joined the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in February 2024 as \na Public Affairs Specialist in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. She was \nconsistently  evaluated  as  an  effective  performer,  had  been  recommended  for  conversion  to \npermanent status, and was on the cusp of conversion when she was targeted for termination on \nFebruary 14, 2025, less than two weeks before her probationary period ended. She filed a \ncomplaint with OSC in March 2025 alleging that her termination was a PPP under 5 U.S.C. § 2302. \nOSC acknowledged receipt, but following the Probationary Directive, it closed the complaint in \nMay 2025. Plaintiff Civil Servant 4 was on administrative leave when she departed her position \nthat same month.  \n18.  Plaintiff Civil Servant 5 is proceeding under a pseudonym. He was an attorney who \nbegan working at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in July 2024 in its \nDivision of Enforcement. He had practiced law for over a decade in private practice, joined federal \nservice out of a commitment to public enforcement work, and received positive feedback from \nsupervisors throughout his tenure. On February 19, 2025, without prior notice, he was terminated \nalong with several other probationary employees in his office. He filed a complaint with OSC \nalleging that his termination was a PPP under 5 U.S.C. § 2302. OSC acknowledged receipt, but \nfollowing the Probationary Directive, it closed the complaint in May 2025. \n19.  Defendant OSC is an independent federal agency headquartered in Washington, \nD.C. OSC is responsible for investigating and prosecuting PPPs under 5 U.S.C. § 2302. It is \ncharged with safeguarding current and former employees, as well as applicants for federal \nemployment, from retaliation and other PPPs.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 8 of 40\n20.  Defendant Jamieson Greer is the Acting Special Counsel of OSC and is sued in his \nofficial  capacity.  The  Acting  Special  Counsel  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  and \nenforcement of OSC policies and directives, including the Probationary Directive and closure \nnotices at issue in this case. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § 1331  (federal  question \njurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1346. This Court also has authority to issue declaratory and injunctive \nrelief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 et seq., and the APA, 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. \n22.  Venue is proper in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). Defendants are agencies or officers of the United States sued \nin their official capacities and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action \noccurred and continue to occur within this district. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n23.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706, authorizes judicial review of final agency actions.  \nUnder the APA, a court may set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” that exceeds an agency’s statutory authority, \nor that is adopted “without observance of procedure required by law.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), \n(C), (D). \n24.  OSC is governed by 5 U.S.C. §§ 1211-1218. By statute, OSC is required to:  \n“protect employees, former employees, and applicants for employment from prohibited \npersonnel practices,” (§ 1212(a)(1));  \n \n“receive and investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices,” (§ 1212(a)(2)); \nand \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 9 of 40\n“conduct an investigation of any allegation concerning … activities prohibited by any \ncivil service law, rule, or regulation, including any activity relating to political intrusion \nin personnel decisionmaking,” (§ 1216(a)(4)).  \n \n \n25.  Merit system principles, codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2301, set forth the foundational \nvalues that govern federal personnel management. These principles require, among other things, \nthat recruitment and advancement be based on ability and qualifications, that employees receive \nfair and equitable treatment without regard to political affiliation or other non-merit factors, and \nthat protection be provided against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, and coercion for partisan \npolitical purposes. The principles also promote whistleblower protection and emphasize high \nstandards of integrity, conduct, and concern for the public interest.  \n26.  PPPs, codified at 5 U.S.C. § 2302, are employment-related activities that are banned \nin the federal workforce because they violate the merit system through some form of employment \ndiscrimination,  retaliation,  improper  hiring  practices,  or  failure  to  adhere  to  laws,  rules,  or \nregulations that implement or directly concern the merit system principles. They include, among \nother things, hiring or firing based on political affiliation, retaliating against whistleblowers, or \ngranting unauthorized preferences. \n27.  OSC’s obligation to prohibit PPPs extends to “any employee or applicant for \nemployment,” in an agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 2302(a)(2)(C), which includes probationary \nemployees serving in the competitive or excepted service. See 5 U.S.C. § 2302. A probationary \nemployee in the federal government is generally a new hire or an employee moving into a new \nposition who is undergoing a trial period to assess their fitness for the job. This period typically \nlasts one year for competitive service or Senior Executive Service positions or two years for \nexcepted service positions, allowing the agency to evaluate the employee’s performance and \nconduct before granting a permanent appointment. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 10 of 40\n28.  Federal employees (including those in probationary status), former employees, and \napplicants who believe they have been subjected to a PPP may file a complaint with OSC, which \nserves as the independent investigative and enforcement body for these claims. See 5 U.S.C. § \n1214.  \n29.  When OSC receives a PPP complaint, it is required to investigate to determine \nwhether there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation occurred. See 5 U.S.C. § 1214. If OSC \nfinds such grounds, it can seek corrective action from the employing agency, negotiate a resolution, \nor, if necessary, file a petition with the MSPB to obtain relief for the complainant. See id. § \n1214(b)(2)(B). \n30.  In some cases, such as with potentially unlawful removals, OSC has authority under \n5 U.S.C. § 1214(b)(1)(A)(i) to request an MSPB stay of the personnel action, temporarily halting \nthe agency’s action while OSC investigates. MSPB stay petitions require OSC to present its legal \nand factual basis, and if granted, the stay remains in effect for 45 days (which can be extended), \nso that OSC can complete its investigation or negotiate relief. If OSC declines to seek corrective \naction, it must inform the complainant, who may then have other avenues of review depending on \ntheir statutory rights. \n31.  While OSC retains discretion in how to resolve individual complaints, it may not \ncategorically  refuse  to  investigate  entire  classes  of  complaints  that  fall  within  its  statutory \nauthority.  A  blanket  refusal  to  investigate,  especially  when  based  on  a  legally  erroneous \ninterpretation of its authority, is an abdication of OSC’s statutory responsibility and is subject to \njudicial review under the APA.  \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 11 of 40\nALLEGATIONS \nThe Origin, Purpose, and Independence of OSC \n32.  For more than 140 years, meritocratic principles have been essential to the efficient \nand continuous operation of the career civil service. \n33.  Before that, a “spoils system” reigned and each successive president simply filled \nfederal jobs with political allies. Under this patronage system, positions were not filled based on \nqualifications or merit, and when presidential administrations changed, employees were regularly \ndismissed from government regardless of how well they had performed their duties. The spoils \nsystem was rife with corruption. By 1832, Senator Henry Clay called it \na detestable system. . . And if it were to be perpetuated—if the offices, honors, and dignities \nof the people were to be put up to public scramble, to be decided by the result of every \npresidential  election—our  Government  and  institutions,  becoming  intolerable,  would \nfinally end in despotism. \n \nJay M. Shafritz et al., Personnel Management in Government: Politics and Process (5th ed. 2001). \n \n34.  The Pendleton Act of 1883 ended the spoils system and created the competitive \ncivil service, wherein employees were hired on the basis of their knowledge and expertise, not \npolitical ideology. Subsequent congressional and executive actions have consistently moved the \nfederal civil service in one direction: toward greater protections and political insulation for \nmembers of the career civil service, and toward a greater proportion of the federal workforce being \ncovered by these protections. This progress has been charted to improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the federal government as it works for the American people. The civil service \nsystem  was  intended  to  eliminate  the  myriad  ills  of  the  spoils  system:  the  inefficiency  of \nquadrennial patronage scrambles, the inferior quality of workers selected for reasons besides merit, \nthe loss of expertise attendant to regular purges of the civil service ranks, and the perils of a \nworkforce loyal to an individual president or administration.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 12 of 40\n35.  Whereas the Pendleton Act eliminated the spoils system and introduced a merit-\nbased civil service as a key pillar of our democratic system, the Civil Service Reform Act \n(“CSRA”) of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, was the signature, bipartisan reform that \nhas most shaped the system we have today. It created a “new framework”  of the modern civil \nservice, provided clear protections for career federal employees against undue partisan political \ninfluence, and extended adverse action rights by statute to a larger cohort of employees, so that the \nbusiness of government can be carried out efficiently and effectively, in compliance with the law, \nand in a manner that encourages individuals to apply to participate in the civil service. See Lindahl \nv. Office of Personnel Mgmt., 470 U.S. 768, 773 (1985) (explaining that the CSRA “overhauled \nthe civil service system”); see also United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 443 (1988). \n36.  The CSRA was one of Congress’s comprehensive responses to the vulnerabilities \nin civil service protections exposed during the Nixon administration.   \n37.  A central goal of the CSRA was to ensure meaningful review of adverse personnel \nactions and ensure that “[e]mployees are . . . protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, \nand from partisan political coercion.”2 It was designed to ensure that federal employment decisions \nare based on merit—not political loyalty, patronage, or personal favoritism.3 \n38.  Congress  codified  a  set  of  merit  system  principles  and  PPPs  that  form  the \nfoundation of a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce. As explained above, these include \nprotections for whistleblowers; requirements for open and competitive hiring; pay comparability; \nefficient use of the workforce; and fair and equitable treatment of employees. 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b). \n \n2 S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 19 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2741. \n3 CSRA, Pub. L. No. 95-454, § 101, 92 Stat. at 1114; see also Fong, Bruce D., Whistleblower \nProtection and the Office of Special Counsel: The Development of Reprisal Law in the 1980’s, \n40 Am. U.L.

To help carry out these protections, Congress, in the CSRA, created OSC and \nvested it with broad authority and mandate to receive and investigate allegations of PPPs, seek \ncorrective action for employees subjected to such practices, bring disciplinary charges against \noffending officials, and enforce the Hatch Act. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1212, 1214, 1215. \n40.  In 1989, Congress enacted the Whistleblower Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 101-12, \n103 Stat. 16, which clarified OSC’s primary role as the federal government’s independent protector \nof whistleblowers and other employees subjected to PPPs, and affirmed OSC’s independent status \nwithin the executive branch. \n41.  OSC possesses broad investigative and enforcement powers, including the ability \nto: compel testimony under oath; issue subpoenas; obtain documents; take depositions; receive \nevidence; bring corrective action petitions before the MSPB; recommend or initiate disciplinary \naction; and transmit disclosures of legal violations, gross mismanagement, abuses of authority, or \nthreats to public safety to agency heads or the Attorney General. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1212(b), 1213, \n1214, 1215. \n42.  OSC also has statutory authority under 5 U.S.C. § 1214(b)(1)(A)(i) to request a stay \nof a personnel action from the MSPB where it has reasonable grounds to believe that an agency \naction was taken as a result of a PPP. \n43.  OSC’s ability to investigate and protect against PPPs is a core safeguard of the \nfederal  civil  service  system.  This  is  especially  true  for  probationary  employees.  Because \nprobationary employees generally cannot appeal adverse actions to the MSPB, OSC is often the \nonly avenue available to protect them from retaliation, political interference, and other PPPs. \nWithout OSC’s oversight, agencies could treat probationary employees in unlawful ways. OSC \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 14 of 40\nserves as a backstop to prevent the erosion of merit-based protections during the earliest stage of \nfederal employment.  \n44.  While OSC has discretion in how to conduct investigations and allocate resources, \nit is also bound by mandatory statutory obligations under title 5, as explained above.  \n45.  These include the obligations to receive and investigate complaints of PPPs and \nprotect employees from them. More broadly, OSC must investigate activities prohibited by any \ncivil service law or rule. See Bufkin v. Collins, 145 S. Ct. 728, 737 (2025) (“It is undisputed that \nthe word ‘shall’ imposes a mandatory command. ‘Shall’ means ‘must.’”) (citing Shapiro v. \nMcManus, 577 U.S. 39, 43 (2015) and Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States, 579 U.S. 162, \n171-172 (2016)). \n46.  To preserve its independence, Congress provided that the Special Counsel is \nappointed by the President with Senate confirmation and may be removed only for cause, \nspecifically, “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” See 5 U.S.C. § 1211(b). This \nstructure distinguishes OSC from typical executive agencies and was designed to insulate it from \npolitical influence. \n47.  These for-cause protections reflect Congress’s intent that the Special Counsel serve \nas an impartial enforcer of civil service laws, independent from political pressures that might \notherwise compromise OSC’s mission. \n48.  In 2023, the Senate confirmed Hampton Dellinger to serve as Special Counsel.  \n49.  Since the beginning of the current Trump Administration, however, the career civil \nservice as well as the structure, operations, and independence of OSC, as carefully designed by \nCongress nearly fifty years ago, have come under sustained attack. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 15 of 40\nThe Trump Administration’s Assault on the Career Civil Service  \n50.  Since returning to power, the Trump Administration has made clear its intent to (1) \ndismantle the career civil service because it views career federal employees not as nonpartisan \nprofessionals fulfilling their duties, but as obstacles to the Administration’s policy objectives; (2) \nfill  the  federal  workforce  ranks  with  loyalists;  and  (3)  systematically  undermine  the  very \ninstitutions, including OSC, that Congress created to enforce civil service protections and uphold \nthe rule of law. \n51.  President  Trump  has  publicly  disparaged  career  civil  servants  as  “crooked,” \n“dishonest” and “corrupt.”4 On the first day of his second term, he declared that “most” federal \nemployees “are being fired” and added that “it should be all of them.”5  \n52.  Vice President JD Vance echoed this hostility, stating that President Trump should, \n“fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state. Replace \nthem with our people.”6 \n53.  The Administration’s contempt for the professional federal workforce is not limited \nto the President and Vice President. In a February 2025 memo, Office of Management and Budget \nDirector Russell Vought and Office of Personnel Management then-Acting Director Charles Ezell \ncondemned what they called a “corrupt federal bureaucracy.”7 Vought has also proclaimed: \n \n4 Erich Wagner, Trump’s second-term agenda: Breaking the bureaucracy, Gov’t Exec.

President Trump further advanced this agenda through Executive Order 14,171, \nreinstating Schedule F under an effort rebranded as Schedule Policy/Career, which aims to strip \ncivil service protections from a wide swath of career civil servants to facilitate the at-will removal \nof federal employees. As he signed the Executive Order, the President declared that he was “getting \nrid of all the cancer, the cancer caused by the Biden administration.”9  \n55.  The Administration has recently escalated its campaign against career civil servants \nengaged in whistleblowing and oversight activities. For instance, at the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (FEMA), employees who signed a letter to Congress objecting to the \nAdministration’s handling of disaster response have faced reprisal.10 At the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA), multiple employees were recently fired after  raising concerns about \ntheir  agency‘s  actions  to  undermine  core  environmental  protections.11  These  actions  are \nemblematic of a broader strategy of firing or sidelining civil servants and the urgent need to \nsafeguard whistleblowers from retaliation. \n56.  In addition to firing and attacking nonpartisan civil servants, the Administration has \nturned to politicized hirings to reshape the federal workforce in its own ideological image. \nPresident Trump issued Executive Order 14,317 in July 2025 announcing the creation of “Schedule \n \n8 Molly Redden, Andy Kroll & Nick Surgey, “Put Them in Trauma”: Inside a Key MAGA \nLeader’s Plans for a New Trump Agenda, ProPublica (Oct. 28, 2024), https://perma.cc/L6YC-\nVUVF. \n9 90 Fed.

And the new Schedule G could allow the President to redefine \nan  untold  number  of  career  positions  as  political  positions  and  open  positions  across  the \ngovernment for Trump loyalists, with no limit on hires.12 \n57.  The Administration also recently unveiled a “Merit Hiring Plan” that can be used \nto screen applicants based on their loyalty to the President’s Executive Orders. Applicants are \nasked to identify which of President Trump’s policies and Executive Orders are “significant” to \nthem and describe how they would help implement those priorities if hired, an overt politicization \nof the merit-based hiring process.     \n58.  And all of this is happening at the same time that the Trump Administration is \nsystematically attacking the institutions that Congress created to prevent these illegal abuses and \nsafeguard a merit-based system.  \n59.  The Administration is weakening the independence of the MSPB, the agency \nresponsible for adjudicating appeals of adverse personnel actions. The MSPB was designed by \nCongress to be a three-member bipartisan board. Board members are appointed by the President \nand confirmed by the Senate to serve staggered seven-year terms and, under 5 U.S.C. § 1202(d), \nmay be removed only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. In February 2025, \nhowever, President Trump removed Chair Cathy Harris, a Democratic appointee, without citing \nany of the statutory grounds for removal, in clear (and admitted) violation of the statute.

In another blow to federal accountability structures, President Trump removed \nmultiple Inspectors General, the very officials (in addition to the Special Counsel) to whom \nemployees would ordinarily report misconduct or whistleblower retaliation.14 \n61.  Still further, the Administration has moved to curtail collective bargaining rights \nfor hundreds of thousands of federal employees.15 In doing so, it aims to eliminate access to \ngrievance  and  arbitration  procedures,  depriving  civil  servants  of  critical  safeguards  against \nunwarranted adverse actions and retaliation.16 \n62.  And, of course, as relevant here and as discussed throughout this complaint, the \nTrump Administration is dismantling the independence of OSC \n63.  Taken together, these and other actions17 reflect a coordinated campaign to purge, \npoliticize, and control the federal workforce while dismantling the guardrails Congress installed \n \n13 Special Couns. ex rel.

The Administration is not only targeting \nindividual  civil  servants  but  threatening  the  nonpartisan  foundation  of  the  modern  federal \nworkforce. \nThe Trump Administration’s Probationary Employee Terminations \n64.  The Trump Administration’s assault on the civil service has also extended to \nprobationary employees, virtually all of whom had been hired or promoted by the previous \nadministration.  Shortly after the Inauguration, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the \nchief human resources agency and personnel policy manager for the federal government, issued \nguidance on probationary periods, advising agencies that probationary periods are “an essential \ntool for agencies to assess employee performance and manage staffing levels,” and directing \nagencies to provide OPM with a list of all probationary employees, and instructing agencies to \n“promptly determine” whether probationary employees should be retained.18  \n65.  On February 11, 2025, the President issued an Executive Order directing agency \nheads to “promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force…” and to \ndevelop “[r]eorganization [p]lans.”19  \n66.  Between February 12 and 14, 2025, the Trump Administration initiated a sweeping \ngovernment-wide effort to terminate thousands of probationary federal employees.20 The culling \n \n18 See Exec.

At  the  time  of  the  firings,  there  were  approximately  200,000  probationary \nemployees in the federal workforce.21 These terminations were reportedly executed without any \nindividualized assessment of performance, conduct, or fitness for continued employment and many \nof the termination notices were riddled with errors.  \n67.  Soon after the terminations, probationary employees began filing complaints with \nOSC, alleging that these terminations were unlawful and constituted PPPs. Many requested that \nOSC exercise its authority under 5 U.S.C. § 1214 to petition the MSPB for stays of their removals. \n68.  On February 21, 2025, OSC filed a stay request with the MSPB on behalf of six \nprobationary employees, which the Board granted. See Ex. A (Feb. 21, 2025, OSC Stay Request); \nEx. B (Feb. 28, 2025, MSPB Order on Stay Request). A few days later, on February 28, 2025, \nOSC expanded its effort and successfully obtained a broader stay of over 5,000 probationary \nterminations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). See Ex. C (Feb. 28, 2025, OSC Stay \nRequest); Ex. D (Mar. 5, 2025, MSPB Order on Stay Request).  \n69.  In its stay petitions, OSC, under Special Counsel Dellinger, explained how its \ninvestigation revealed that the mass terminations of probationary employees were in fact unlawful \nRIFs, conducted as part of the Trump Administration’s efforts to reduce and reorganize the federal \nworkforce, disguised as probationary removals.  \n \nStone (Feb. 14, 2025), https://perma.cc/TYT9-LU98. \n21 Tami Luhby et al., Thousands of probationary employees fired as Trump administration \ndirects agencies to carry out widespread layoffs, CNN (Feb. 14, 2025), https://perma.cc/WF58-\nF5HP.    \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 21 of 40\n70.  As  OSC  explained,  the  en  masse  probationary  terminations  were  part  of  a \ncentralized Trump Administration effort to reduce and reorganize the federal workforce, with \nOPM not only directing agencies to carry out this effort, but also instructing them how to do so.  \n71.  In particular, with respect to the USDA probationary terminations, OSC stated that \n“[d]ocuments  that  OSC  obtained  and  interviews  that  OSC  conducted  with  USDA  officials \nconfirmed that USDA relied heavily on OPM guidance in terminating its probationary employees.”  \nEx. C, at 4.  \n72.  OSC explained that “OPM provided verbal guidance in a February 12, 2025, \nmeeting of the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) Council about terminating probationary \nemployees and then emailed a termination letter template for agencies to use in effecting those \nterminations.” Id. Later that evening, according to OSC, OPM emailed USDA and other agencies \nwith additional guidance; the email stated: “Please partner with your CHCO to action those you \nknow you wish to separate from [sic] by the end of the day tomorrow 2/13/2025, using the attached \ntemplate letter (modified to account for whether the employee is in the competitive or excepted \nservice).” Id. OSC explained that this email “specified that agencies could exempt probationary \nemployees that agencies had identified as ‘high-performing employees in mission critical areas.’” \nId. at 5. \n73.  OSC explained that the next day, February 14, 2025, OPM convened a “Special \nSession” of the CHCO Council for the purpose of further discussing the probationary terminations. \nOSC  noted  that,  in  that  meeting,  “OPM  reinforced  the  centrality  of  the  ‘mission-critical’ \ndesignation,” and, in a follow-up email after the meeting, OPM stated, “‘We have asked that you \nseparate probationary employees that you have not identified as mission-critical no later than end \nof day Monday, 2/17.’” Id. According to OSC, OPM’s email also noted: “‘An employee’s \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 22 of 40\nperformance must be viewed through the current needs and best interest of the government, in light \nof the President’s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.” Id. And, \naccording  to  OSC,  OPM’s  email  stated,  “‘OPM  believes  “qualifications  for  continued \nemployment” in the current context means that only the highest-performing probationers in \nmission-critical areas should be retained.’” Id. \n74.  OSC’s  investigation  revealed  that  USDA  began  terminating  probationary \nemployees  “[o]n  February  13,  2025,  one  day  after  OPM  provided  its  initial  guidance  and \ntermination template.” Id.  OSC explained that the evidence it gathered showed that USDA created \ntwo template termination letters, “one for probationary employees in the competitive service and \none  for  probationary  employees  in  the  excepted  service,  which  it  used  to  draft  the  mass \nterminations it sent to…each of the nearly six thousand” terminated probationary employees. Id. \nat 6. According to OSC, “[t]hese templates were in turn based on the OPM template.” Id. Further, \naccording  to  OSC,  “USDA  officials  understood  OPM’s  February  12,  2025  email  to  be  an \ninstruction to begin terminating probationary employees who had not been identified as mission-\ncritical. USDA officials also took OPM’s guidance to mean that the agency lacked discretion to \nretain probationary employees who did not hold mission-critical positions, regardless of their \nperformance.” Id. \n75.  OSC stated that its investigation revealed that USDA terminated approximately \n5,900 probationary employees.  OSC explained, “OSC’s investigation confirmed that USDA made \nno attempt to assess the individual performance or conduct of any of these probationary employees \nbefore deciding whether to terminate them—the decision to retain a particular probationary \nemployee depended entirely on whether their position was designated as mission-critical.” Id. at \n7. Further, according to OSC, “[w]hether USDA terminated each probationary employee therefore \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 23 of 40\ndepended  entirely  on  the  nature  of  that  employee’s  position,  not  on  the  adequacy  of  their \nperformance or fitness for federal service.” Id. \n76.  This was the same approach that other agencies took as well.  On February 21, \n2025, a week before filing its stay request with the MSPB related to all USDA’s probationary \nterminations, OSC filed stay requests on behalf of six terminated probationary employees at six \ndifferent  agencies: the  Department of  Education,  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management,  the \nDepartment of Energy, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and USDA.22 See Ex. A.  \n77.  As OSC explained, each of the six probationary employees at six different agencies \nwere terminated as part of a centrally-directed, governmentwide termination of probationary \nemployees.  “[E]ach was terminated at the same time as significant numbers of other federal \nemployees,” and “[t]he language in Complainants’ termination notices is quite similar and does \nnot describe any specific issues with any of the Complainants’ performance or conduct,” with \n“none provid[ing] any detail or individualized assessment.” Id. at 3-4. Therefore, based on “official \ndirectives, public statements, and the termination notices issued to Complainants, it appears that \nthe Agencies terminated probationary employees not to eliminate poor performance but rather \nbecause of a purported lack of work, shortage of funds, and reorganization, which require use of \nRIF procedures.” Id. at 12.  \n78.  As OSC explained—in both its February 21 filing related to employees at six \nagencies  and  its  February  28  filing  related  to  all  USDA  terminations—such  probationary \nterminations constituted PPPs under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(12), which prohibits personnel actions \n \n22 See U.S. Off. of Special Counsel, Special Counsel Dellinger Statement on Request That MSPB \nStays Terminations of Probationary Employees (Feb. 24, 2025), https://perma.cc/3EXT-R3WN.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 24 of 40\nthat violate any law, rule, or regulation implementing or directly concerning the merit system \nprinciples outlined in § 2301. Additionally, OSC cited its statutory duty under 5 U.S.C. § \n1216(a)(4) to investigate “activities prohibited by any civil service law, rule, or regulation.” \n79.  OSC  explained  that  the  mass  terminations  were  not  based  on  individual \nperformance  or  misconduct  but  were  in  fact  actions  carried  out  pursuant  to  the  Trump \nAdministration’s directives to reduce and reorganize the federal workforce. As such, they were \nRIFs in substance if not in name and thus subject to the legal requirements governing RIFs under \nfederal law.  \n80.  The  agencies,  however,  failed  to  follow  any  of  the  applicable  statutory  and \nregulatory requirements for conducting a lawful RIF. These failures rendered the actions unlawful \nand, as OSC explained, transformed them into PPPs. Specifically, the agencies violated 5 U.S.C. \n§ 3502, the statutory provision that authorizes reductions in force, and the RIF implementing \nregulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 351, which directly implicate numerous merit system principles, \nincluding: \na.  Selection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative \nability, knowledge, and skills, 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(1);  \nb.  All employees should receive fair and equitable treatment with proper regard for \ntheir constitutional rights, 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(2);  \nc.  The federal work force should be used efficiently and effectively, 5 U.S.C. § \n2301(b)(5); \nd.  Employees should be retained on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, 5 \nU.S.C. § 2301(b)(6);  \ne.  Employees should be protected against arbitrary action, 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8)(A).  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 25 of 40\n81.  As OSC articulated, the RIF requirements in 5 U.S.C. § 3502 and 5 C.F.R. Part 351 \nare statutes and regulations that directly concern multiple merit system principles. Thus, an \nagency’s failure to comply with the RIF requirements in § 3502 and its implementing regulations \nconstitutes a violation of § 2302(b)(12), making the terminations PPPs.  \n82.  OSC emphasized that the RIF statutes and regulations afford employees vital \nsubstantive and procedural rights, which the agencies ignored. Rather than follow lawful RIF \nprocedures, agencies improperly relied on probationary status to bypass those protections. In doing \nso, and as OSC explained, agencies “used the probationary status of employees to accomplish a \nRIF without affording the employees the substantive rights and due process they are entitled to by \nlaw.” See Ex. A, at 10. Accordingly, these terminations are contrary to “law, rule, or regulation \nimplementing or directly concerning the merit system principles,” id. at 9, and constitute PPPs.  \n83.   In addition to the RIF-related violations, OSC also argued that the agencies had \nviolated another set of regulations that directly concern merit system principles, namely, 5 C.F.R. \n§§ 315.801 et seq., which at the time prohibited termination of probationary employees in the \ncompetitive  service  for  reasons  unrelated  to  the  employee’s  individual  fitness  for  federal \nemployment.  As  OSC  explained  to  the  MSPB,  the  terminations  plainly  did  not  stem  from \nindividual  assessments  but  from  broad  directives  to  eliminate  a  category  of  civil  servants \nwholesale. \nThe Removal of Hampton Dellinger and OSC’s Sudden Reversal of Position \n84.  While OSC was seeking a stay of the probationary terminations before the MSPB, \nPresident Trump was simultaneously seeking to remove Special Counsel Dellinger, even though \nDellinger’s statutory five-year term was not set to expire until 2029. See 5 U.S.C. § 1211(b). \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 26 of 40\n85.  Dellinger  was  initially  removed  by  President  Trump  in  February  2025,  but \nDellinger challenged his removal in federal court, asserting that his for-cause removal protections \nunder § 1211 barred the President from terminating him without a showing of inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance. Although a district court initially enjoined the termination, the D.C. \nCircuit lifted the stay on appeal. On March 6, 2025, Dellinger withdrew his legal challenge and \nvacated his position as Special Counsel.  \n86.  Following Dellinger’s departure, the Trump Administration installed a succession \nof politically aligned Acting Special Counsels. First came Doug Collins, who simultaneously \nserved as Secretary of Veterans Affairs, followed by the current Acting Special Counsel, Jamieson \nGreer, a senior White House official and U.S. Trade Representative.  \n87.  The current nominee to serve as the permanent Special Counsel is Paul Ingrassia. \nAs reported by news outlets: \nIn contrast to prior leaders of the Office of Special Counsel, who typically had years of \nlegal experience, Ingrassia has only briefly worked as a lawyer. He graduated from \nCornell Law School in 2022 and became a registered attorney in New York less than a \nyear ago, in July 2024. He caught the eye of the president through his pro-Trump blog \nposts during the 2024 presidential campaign and joined the administration in January \n2025.23 \n \n88.  News reports note Ingrassia’s views about the federal workforce he would be tasked \nwith protecting:  \nThe idea that civil servants are “apolitical” has always been hogwash, a myth propounded \nby these very same people who never want to be held responsible for anything,’ he wrote \non a conservative site in November. \n \nAmid the U.S. DOGE Service’s slashing of the federal workforce, Ingrassia wrote on \nSubstack that ‘all the worst elements of human nature—arrogance and ego, combined with \nlaziness and stupidity—become magnified in a bureaucratic government system … the \n \n23 See Tom Dreisbach, Trump nominates official with ties to antisemitic extremists to lead ethics \nagency, N.P.R., (May 30, 2025), https://perma.cc/FFM7-CKF5.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 27 of 40\nworkers themselves acclimate to doing little of anything of substance, always on the \ntaxpayer’s dime....24 \n \n89.  The change in OSC leadership resulted in an immediate and dramatic reversal of \nlegal positions. On April 8, 2025, OSC, under the leadership of Acting Special Counsel Greer, \nissued the Probationary Directive, instructing staff to close all ongoing investigations into mass \nprobationary terminations on the ground that such actions no longer qualified as PPPs. See Ex. E \n(Apr. 8. 2025, OSC Directive).   \n90.  The Probationary Directive, issued by a new political appointee, Senior Counsel \nCharles Baldis, acting under delegated authority from Acting Special Counsel Greer, directed \ninvestigators to conduct only a “simple review” of probationary complaints and to close those \ninvestigations unless the complainant articulated separate allegations of whistleblowing or similar. \nId.  \n91.  The Directive abruptly changed OSC’s position—and abandoned OSC’s prior \nfactual findings—that the probationary terminations constituted a RIF. The Directive, without \nfurther factual inquiry, decreed that because there was “no well-established precedent that the \ntargeting of probationary employees as a class constitutes a RIF,” OSC would not intervene “into \nthis unsettled legal question” and would instead treat these terminations as “ordinary.” Id. at 2.   \n92.  The  Directive  also  rejected  OSC’s  prior  conclusion  that  the  probationary \nterminations violated then-operative regulations protecting probationary employees from arbitrary \nfiring.  The Directive explained that the regulatory protections provided to probationary workers—\nincluding notice and limited process for probationers terminated because of their qualifications, \n \n24 Meryl Kornfield, Cleve R. Wootson, Jr., Trump’s pick to protect federal workers shares a \ndisdain for them, Wash. Post (July 24, 2025), https://perma.cc/R6KJ-VLFD. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 28 of 40\nfitness, and performance—did not bear on whether or how an agency may terminate those \nprobationers for reasons totally unrelated to their fitness or performance. Id. at 3-4.   \n93.  The Probationary Directive also asserted that OSC’s review should mirror the \nnarrow appeal rights under a separate framework concerning direct appeals to the MSPB, id. at 4, \ndespite Congress’s directive that probationary employees are protected from PPPs and within \nOSC’s jurisdiction and mandate. See 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2). \n94.  And pursuant to the Directive, OSC advised that absent distinct, individualized \nallegations of discrimination or similar, it would not investigate whether probationary terminations \nviolated merit system principles but would instead “terminate the investigation.” Id.    \n95.  Consistent  with  the  new  policy,  OSC  began  issuing  mass  Closure  Notices \nbeginning on or around April 21, 2025. These Closure Notices informed complainants that OSC \nwould not investigate or pursue their claims. See Ex. F (Redacted Example of OSC Preliminary \nDetermination); Ex. G (Redacted Example of OSC Closure Notice).  \n96.  As discussed further below, the Probationary Directive failed to adequately explain \nOSC’s changed position before the MSPB and ignored established statutory mandates in departing \nfrom precedent.  \n97.  As a result of the Probationary Directive, more than 2,000 pending complaints were \nsummarily dismissed. See Ex. F (citing number of complaints). Closure Notices issued in April \nand  May  2025  disregarded  factual  records  previously  developed  by  OSC  investigators, \nmischaracterized the agency’s statutory jurisdiction, and foreclosed any further review, effectively \nimmunizing the purge from scrutiny. \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 29 of 40\nDefendants Offered Arbitrary and Unlawful Justifications for the Probationary Directive and \nClosure Notices that Contravened OSC’s Clear Statutory Mandate \n98.  The  Probationary  Directive  and  the  resulting  Closure  Notices  constitute  final \nagency actions under the APA and form the basis for this lawsuit. They are arbitrary, capricious, \nand contrary to law. \n99.  The Probationary Directive and subsequent Closure Notices purport to offer legal \njustifications for OSC’s abrupt policy reversal. But each of OSC’s explanations is poorly \nreasoned, factually unsupported, and legally flawed.   \n100.   First, OSC asserted that the mass probationary terminations did not constitute a \nRIF because, in its view, a “RIF, properly applied, targets a position and not a person,” and “[i]t \nis not apparent from the facts alleged that the terminated probationary employees were targeted \nbecause of a reduction in force effort targeting the positions they held.  Rather, it seems they \nwere targeted because they were probationary employees.”  Ex. E, at 2.  \n101.  This rationale is both incorrect and contrary to the evidence before the agency. \nFirst, agencies did target positions. OSC itself had previously concluded as much. In its February \n28, 2025, stay request to the MSPB, OSC reported:  \nThrough its investigation, OSC has obtained documents and interviewed multiple USDA \npersonnel at relevant levels within that agency to gain a clear picture of how the \nprobationary terminations at issue occurred. This evidence shows that USDA conducted a \nmass termination of approximately 5,900 probationary employees without consideration \nof their individual performance or fitness for federal employment, but rather because it \ndid not identify their positions as ‘mission-critical.’   \n \nEx. C, at 4.   \n \n102.  The Probationary Directive identifies no new information that undermines OSC’s \nprior factual conclusion, which was based on evidence, including documents and multiple \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 30 of 40\ninterviews. Instead, the Probationary Directive simply states, counter to the facts previously \nfound and with no new evidentiary record, the opposite.  \n103.  Further, even assuming that the mass probationary terminations did not constitute \na de facto RIF, OSC’s conclusion that “targeting probationary employees as a class,” Ex. E, at 2, \nremoves the conduct from PPP scrutiny is legally untenable. That kind of categorical targeting \nstill violates multiple laws and regulations that directly concern merit system principles and \ntherefore constitutes a PPP under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(12). \n104.  Terminating employees en masse based solely on probationary status conflicts \nwith core merit system principles, including: selection and advancement should be determined \nsolely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(1); employees \nshould be retained on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(6); and \nemployees should be protected against arbitrary action, 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8)(A).   \n105.  As such, regardless of whether the mass terminations constituted a RIF, these \nterminations  violated  merit  system  principles,  making  them  unlawful  under  5  U.S.C.  § \n2302(b)(12).  \n106.  Second, the Directive justified OSC’s abandonment of its prior position on the \ngrounds that because there was “no well-established precedent that the targeting of probationary \nemployees as a class constitutes a RIF,” OSC would not intervene “into this unsettled legal \nquestion” and would instead treat these terminations as “ordinary.” Ex. E, at 2. But the statute \ndoes not permit OSC to decline to exercise jurisdiction because a case presents “unsettled legal \nquestion[s].” OSC’s justification is legally irrelevant, and agencies cannot evade their statutory \nobligations simply because the underlying fact pattern is novel. Indeed, if anything, the \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 31 of 40\nextraordinary nature of these mass terminations by this Administration imposed an even greater \nduty on OSC to investigate and enforce the law. \n107.  Third, the Probationary Directive claims that OPM regulations governing \nprobationary terminations should be read “in light of existing law,” specifically Chapter 75 of \ntitle 5, U.S. Code, which governs federal employees’ adverse action rights, and that agencies \nhave broad discretion in deciding whether to terminate probationary employees. See Ex. E, at 3.  \n108.  Even more troubling, OSC asserted that because probationary employees have \nlimited appeal rights to the MSPB, “[t]his weighs heavily against treating alleged violations \noutside of this limitation as matters in which OSC should intervene.” Id. at 4.  \n109.  This position is flatly inconsistent with OSC’s statutory obligations. OSC’s \njurisdiction is not limited to cases involving MSPB appeal rights. OSC is expressly tasked with \ninvestigating violations of any civil service law, rule, or regulation, including merit system \nviolations affecting probationers who lack direct MSPB recourse. And OSC is expressly tasked \nwith protecting all employees—including probationary employees—from violations of merit \nsystem laws, rules, or regulations which qualify as PPPs under statute. The fact that Chapter 75 \nlimits probationary employees’ appeal rights to the MSPB has no bearing on whether OSC has \nan obligation to protect them from PPPs—it plainly does. \n110.  Another purported justification emerged in OSC’s individual Closure Notices, \nwhich stated: “[e]ven if OSC could prove that the decision to terminate your probationary \nemployment was not based on an individualized assessment of your performance, OSC is unable \nto  pursue  a  claim  that  it  was  unlawful…because  your  termination,  in  the  context  of  the \ngovernment-wide effort to reduce the federal service through probationary terminations, was more \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 32 of 40\nlikely effected in accordance with the new administration’s priorities than a decision personal to \nyou.” Ex. F.   \n111.  This explanation lacks legal relevance and defies logic. Nowhere does OSC explain \nwhy terminations carried out pursuant to “administration priorities” are exempt from statutory and \nregulatory requirements.   \n112.  To the contrary, that the terminations were carried out based on White House and \nOPM priorities, rather than an individualized assessment, is precisely the point—these \nterminations were de facto RIFs, but they did not follow RIF requirements and were therefore \nPPPs. And even if they were ultimately found not to be a de facto RIF, these terminations \nviolated core merit system principles requiring that selection and advancement be determined \nsolely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills; employees be retained on the basis \nof the adequacy of their performance; and employees be protected against arbitrary action. See 5 \nU.S.C. § 2301(b).   \n113.  Moreover, in adopting the Probationary Directive and issuing the mass Closure \nNotices, Defendants failed to consider the reliance interests of workers who filed PPP complaints, \nmany of whom were initially advised by OSC that their claims were meritorious. \n114.  In addition, by categorically excluding these probationary employees from PPP \nprotection, OSC has taken an action that has no basis in in OSC’s statutes, which define “covered \nemployees,” PPPs, and OSC’s role includes investigating them. \n115.  Probationary employees, while lacking certain appeal rights to the MSPB, are not \nexcluded from OSC’s investigative authority. They are entitled to protection from PPPs so long as \nthey allege conduct that falls within the 14 categories enumerated in § 2302(b) (e.g., retaliation, \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 33 of 40\ndiscrimination,  nepotism,  violation  of  merit  system  principles).  OSC  may  not  categorically \nexclude probationary employees.  \n116.  In fact, the MSPB has held that probationary employees subject to a RIF have \nappeal rights under RIF-specific procedures. Bielomaz v. Dep’t of the Navy, 86 M.S.P.R. 276 \n(2006); see also Coleman v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 62 M.S.PR. 187, 189-90 (1994) (holding that \nan appellant need not be an “employee” under § 7511 to enjoy Board appeal rights under RIF \nprocedures  at  5  C.F.R.  §  351.262).  These  cases  confirm  that  the  scope  of  protection  for \nprobationers is broader than OSC now claims. \n117.  In short, OSC’s Probationary Directive and Closure Notices not only fail to meet \nthe APA’s standard for reasoned decision-making, they affirmatively violate the agency’s statutory \nresponsibilities, and they adopt justifications that have no basis in law. They are arbitrary, \ncapricious, contrary to law, and must be set aside under 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nHarm to Plaintiffs \n118.  Plaintiffs are former federal employees who were summarily terminated during \ntheir probationary periods as part of the Administration’s mass firings in February 2025.  \n119.  OSC’s abrupt reversal, issuing the unlawful Probationary Directive and related \nClosure Notices after receiving the complaints from Civil Servants 1-5 compounded Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries and caused them further distress.  \n120.  Civil  Servant  1’s  termination  inflicted  significant  personal,  professional,  and \nfinancial harm. She had relocated across the country, from Illinois to Alaska, to accept NOAA’s \noffer of a permanent position, incurring thousands of dollars in unreimbursed moving expenses, \nand  relied  on  that  offer  that  would  further  build  her  career  in  public  service  and  marine \nconservation. The loss of her position not only left her with substantial debt but also foreclosed \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 34 of 40\nher ability to apply for most Alaska state natural resource management jobs due to a statewide \nhiring freeze announced shortly after her termination. The abrupt end to her federal service derailed \nher professional trajectory in her chosen field, forced her into unrelated employment, and deprived \nher of the stability and advancement she reasonably expected from her career appointment. The \nclosure of her OSC complaint left her without any avenue for redress. Until the termination, Civil \nServant 1 planned to stay in the federal civil service indefinitely.  \n121.  Civil Servant 2’s termination caused significant harm. Despite a spotless record and \na recent “Above Fully Successful” performance rating, he was abruptly removed from federal \nservice, cutting short what he expected to be a long-term career at GSA. The loss of his position \ndisrupted  ongoing  projects  and  deprived  him  of  earned  income  and  career  advancement \nopportunities. As a disabled veteran who had already dedicated more than a decade to civilian \nfederal service, he relied on the stability and retirement benefits of continued federal employment, \nbenefits now jeopardized by the mass termination. Even after a federal court ordered his temporary \nreinstatement, he was placed on indefinite administrative leave, leaving him in professional limbo \nuntil GSA issued a final separation. The closure of his OSC complaint left him without any avenue \nfor redress. Until the termination, Civil Servant 2 planned to stay in the federal civil service \nindefinitely.  \n122.  Civil Servant 3 suffered harm from the effort to terminate her employment. She left \na lucrative private-sector position to serve in government, accepting a substantial pay cut in \nreliance on the stability of federal employment and the opportunity to work for the American \npeople. As the primary earner in her household with two young children, the attempted removal \ncreated immediate financial strain and forced her resignation once her position was effectively \ndismantled.  The  experience  derailed  her  career  in  public  service  and  deprived  her  of  the \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 35 of 40\nopportunity to continue her high-level policy work. The closure of her OSC complaint left her \nwithout any avenue for redress. Until the termination efforts, Civil Servant 3 planned to stay in the \nfederal civil service indefinitely.  \n123.  Civil Servant 4 relocated to accept her EPA appointment, only to be terminated \nweeks before conversion to permanent status. The termination disrupted her career trajectory and \ncreated economic and personal upheaval. After months in administrative limbo, she was forced to \nresign in order to secure stable employment back in her home state. The closure of her OSC \ncomplaint left her without any avenue for redress. Until the termination efforts, Civil Servant 4 \nplanned to stay in the federal civil service indefinitely. \n124.  Civil Service 5 left a stable and well-compensated private legal career to pursue \npublic service at the CFTC. His sudden termination, without any performance warning or negative \nevaluation,  caused  financial  hardship  for  his  family  and  diminished  his  future  professional \nprospects.  The  termination  interrupted  ongoing  enforcement  matters  he  was  handling  and \neffectively punished him for choosing public service. The closure of his OSC complaint left him \nwithout any avenue for redress. Until the termination, Civil Servant 5 planned to stay in the federal \ncivil service indefinitely. \n125.  These Plaintiffs timely filed PPP complaints with OSC, prior to the issuance of the \nProbationary Directive. See, e.g., Ex. H (PPP complaint filed by Alden Law Group and Democracy \nForward); Ex. I (second amended PPP complaint filed by Alden Law Group and Democracy \nForward).   \n126.  Under  the  leadership  of  then-Special  Counsel  Hampton  Dellinger,  OSC  had \nacknowledged and opened investigations into their complaints. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 36 of 40\n127.  However, following Dellinger’s removal and the installation of politically loyal \nActing Special Counsels, Plaintiffs received closure notice in April or May 2025. These notices \nstated that OSC would not investigate or pursue their claims, explicitly citing their probationary \nstatus  as  the  reason  for  denial.  As  a  result,  Plaintiffs  were  foreclosed  from  obtaining  any \nadministrative remedy and denied any process or hearing on their claims. \n128.  Plaintiffs had no prior disciplinary record, had received favorable performance \nfeedback, and were never informed of any performance concerns prior to their terminations. Their \nremovals were abrupt and unexplained, with no opportunity to respond or to contest the action. \nThe summary closure of their OSC complaints left them with no avenue for redress and lasting \nharm to their careers and livelihoods. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One \n(Administrative Procedure Act - Arbitrary, Capricious) \n129.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein.  \n130.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires that agency action be set aside if it is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n131.  The Probationary Directive and the Closure Notices constitute final agency \naction. They reflect a complete and insufficiently reasoned reversal of OSC’s prior interpretation \nof its statutory obligations under title 5. \n132.  Just weeks before the Probationary Directive, OSC had issued well-reasoned and \nfactually detailed filings before the MSPB, arguing that the mass termination of probationary \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 37 of 40\nemployees were directed by the Trump Administration for the purpose of reorganizing and \nreducing the federal workforce, constituted an unlawful RIF, violated multiple provisions of \nfederal civil service law, and were therefore unlawful PPPs. The MSPB granted those stay \nrequests. \n133.  The Probationary Directive reversed OSC’s prior legal position without any \nreasoned engagement with the agency’s recent findings or analysis. \n134.  An agency that changes its position must provide a reasoned explanation and \nmeaningfully address its prior legal conclusions and factual findings. OSC failed to do so. It did \nnot reconcile its prior filings and offered only thin, vague, or conclusory statements in place of \nlegal reasoning.  \n135.  An agency policy is arbitrary and capricious where it contradicts prior factual \nfindings, fails to consider important aspects of the problem, or is not the product of reasoned \ndecision-making. OSC’s reversal fits all these criteria. \n136.  OSC’s about face was contrary to the evidence before the agency, including the \nevidence developed in the course of OSC’s prior factual investigations into the probationary \ndeterminations. \n137.  The Probationary Directive and Closure Notices were also pretextual. They \nfollowed the President’s removal of the Senate-confirmed Special Counsel and the installation of \npolitically aligned acting officials. The timing and content of the reversal reflect a political \ndirective, not a genuine legal reevaluation. \n138.  In issuing the Probationary Directive and Closure Notices, OSC relied on factors \nCongress did not intend it to consider, such as OSC’s invocation of the limited MSPB appeal \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 38 of 40\nrights of probationary employees and the Trump Administration’s policy priorities, as reasons to \nclose complaints.  \n139.  OSC also failed to consider the reliance interests of employees who filed PPP \ncomplaints in good faith, many of whom were initially informed by OSC investigators that their \nclaims were meritorious. These complainants had every reason to believe OSC would continue \nits investigation and seek relief. The agency offered no explanation for disregarding these \nexpectations. OSC’s abrupt reversal left these complainants without any opportunity for \nmeaningful review. \n140.  OSC’s reversal has caused direct and concrete harm to Plaintiffs, who were \nterminated and denied the opportunity to have their claims meaningfully investigated. \n141.  For these reasons, the Probationary Directive and Closure Notices must be set \naside under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \nCount Two \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Not in Accordance with Law and Exceeding Statutory \nAuthority) \n142.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein.  \n143.  The APA requires that a reviewing court set aside agency action that is “not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A),(C).   \n144.  OSC’s governing statute requires it to protect “employees” from PPPs. The term \n“employee” includes probationary employees. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1212(a), 2302(a)(2)(A), (C).  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 39 of 40\n145.  Yet the Probationary Directive and Closure Notices rely on a legal interpretation \nthat  excludes  probationary  employees  from  important  OSC  protections.  The  Probationary \nDirective argues that the probationary terminations should be understood “in light of” Chapter 75, \nwhich does not provide probationary employees with an appeal right to the MSPB. According to \nOSC, therefore, “[t]his weighs heavily against treated alleged violations outside of this limitation \nas matters in which OSC should intervene.”   \n146.  This  interpretation  is  contrary  to  law,  rests  on  an  impermissibly  narrow \ninterpretation of OSC’s authority, and effectively nullifies protections that Congress expressly \nextended  to  probationary  employees.  OSC’s  statute  indisputably  obligates  it  to  protect  all \nemployees from PPPs, regardless of whether the employees have a direct right of appeal to the \nMSPB. \n147.  OSC’s  reversal  has  caused  direct  and  concrete  harm  to  Plaintiffs,  who  were \nterminated and denied the opportunity to have their claims meaningfully investigated. \n148.  The Probationary Directive and Closure Notices must be set aside under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) and (C). \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court enter judgment in their favor and grant the \nfollowing relief: \nA. Declare that the Probationary Directive and associated Closure Notices are unlawful under the \nAPA; \nB. Declare that OSC’s categorical exclusion of PPP complaints based on probationary status \nviolates its statutory mandate and is unlawful; \nC. Vacate the Probationary Directive and all Closure Notices issued pursuant to it; \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03107     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 40 of 40\nD. Order OSC to reopen and investigate PPP complaints submitted by probationary employees in \na manner consistent with its statutory obligations under title 5 and applicable law; \nE.
