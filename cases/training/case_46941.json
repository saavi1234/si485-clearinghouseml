INTRODUCTION \n1.  For decades, Plaintiffs Brian J. Driscoll, Jr., Steven J. Jensen, and Spencer L. Evans \nserved this country with distinction and courage as Special Agents and senior officials of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”).  Over the course of their remarkable careers, they \nprevented  terrorist  attacks,  rescued  American  hostages,  saved  children  from  predators,  and \ndisabled violent street gangs.  Each day of their service was dedicated to protecting the American \npeople and to fulfilling the oath they took when they joined the FBI: to “support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States” and to “bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” \n2.  Plaintiffs’ commitment to these higher principles compelled them at all times to \nperform  their  duties  free  from  political  bias  or  influence.    This  same  commitment  galled \nDefendants, who initiated a campaign of retribution against Plaintiffs for what Defendants deemed \nto be a failure to demonstrate sufficient political loyalty.  On August 8, 2025, FBI Director \nKashyap “Kash” P. Patel terminated Plaintiffs’ combined 60 years of distinguished service in \nfederal law enforcement with cursory, single-page letters sent to each Plaintiff.  He did so in \nviolation of federal law and the United States Constitution. \n3.  Patel not only acted unlawfully but deliberately chose to prioritize politicizing the \nFBI over protecting the American people.  As explained herein, his decision to do so degraded the \ncountry’s national security by firing three of the FBI’s most experienced operational leaders, each \nof them experts in preventing terrorism and reducing violent crime. \n4.  Patel openly acknowledged the unlawfulness of his actions.  On or about August 5, \n2025, in a conversation with Driscoll, Patel plainly stated the reasoning behind his firing of FBI \nemployees that Mr. Driscoll sought to defend.  In sum and substance, Patel admitted that his \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 3 of 68\n \nsuperiors, who he referred to as “they” and who Driscoll understood to include Defendant \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”) and the White House (which encompasses Defendant Executive \nOffice of the President (“EOP”)), had directed him to fire anyone who they identified as having \nworked on a criminal investigation against President Donald J. Trump.  Patel explained that he had \nto fire the people his superiors told him to fire, because his ability to keep his own job depended \non the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President.  Patel explained that \nthere was nothing he or Driscoll could do to stop these or any other firings, because “the FBI tried \nto put the President in jail and he hasn’t forgotten it.”  Driscoll indicated his belief that Patel’s \nreference to his superiors meant DOJ and the White House, and Patel did not deny it. \n5.  When Driscoll explained that firing employees based on case assignments would \nbe in direct violation of internal FBI processes meant to adjudicate adverse actions and prevent \nretaliation based on case assignments, Patel said that he understood that and he knew the nature of \nthe summary firings were likely illegal and that he could be sued and later deposed. \n6.  Patel’s  actions  stood  in  stark  contrast  to  his  sworn  testimony  during  his \nconfirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  There, he assured the Committee \nand the country that “all FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.”  An \nexchange with Senator Richard Blumenthal on the topic of firing agents who worked on criminal \ninvestigations involving President Trump proceeded as follows: \n  Sen. Blumenthal:  You’ve  committed  that  the  FBI  will  not  be \npoliticized.    So  here’s  your  first  test.    Will  you \ncommit that you will not tolerate the firing of the FBI \nagents  who  worked  with  the  Special  Counsel’s \nOffice on these investigations? \n \n        . . .  \n \n  Patel:  Senator.  Every FBI employee will be held to the \nabsolute  same  standard,  and  no  one  will  be \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 4 of 68\n \nterminated for case assignments. \n \n7.  Likewise in his written responses to a Senate Questionnaire, Patel repeatedly \nemphasized his commitment that “personnel decisions should be based on performance and \nadherence to the law” and that “every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard, \nand no one will be terminated for case assignments.”  He also asserted that he would “ensure that \nthe appropriate processes are always followed” with respect to adverse actions against FBI \npersonnel. \n8.  As explained herein, Driscoll, Jensen, and Evans were the targets of Defendants’ \nretribution for their refusals to politicize the FBI, and they seek to vindicate their constitutional \nand legal rights.  This vindication will also serve to illuminate and protect the rights of all \nremaining active FBI employees to be free from coercive political demands by Defendants. \n9.  Plaintiffs request that this Court review and grant relief on the grounds that \nDefendants’  actions  violated  their  Fifth  Amendment  rights  to  due  process  and  their  First \nAmendment rights to free association and speech, were taken without any constitutional authority, \nand are a legal nullity.  Plaintiffs seek equitable relief in vindication of their constitutional rights; \ndeclaratory relief under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202; and \nmandamus relief under 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331 because Plaintiffs’ causes of action arise under the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates.  The Court has authority to issue declaratory, injunctive, and equitable relief, including \nreinstatement of Plaintiffs to their employment with the FBI, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and its \ninherent equitable powers.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 5 of 68\n \n11.  Venue is appropriate in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and (e). \nIII.  PARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n12.   Plaintiff Brian J. Driscoll, Jr., is the former Acting Director of the FBI.  From \napproximately March 2025 through the date of his termination, he served as the FBI Assistant \nDirector responsible for the Critical Incident Response Group (“CIRG”).  In this capacity, Driscoll \nwas in charge of all FBI special operations, including national programs centralizing the country’s \ncrisis readiness, response, and resolution through national and field-based law enforcement assets.  \nThese programs include aviation, surveillance, counter-unmanned aerial systems, the FBI’s 55 \nSpecial Weapons and Tactics (“SWAT”) Teams and the Hostage Rescue Team (“HRT”), crisis \nnegotiations,  behavioral  analysis,  cyber  behavior  assessment  center,  the  Violent  Criminal \nApprehension  Program  (ViCAP),  crisis  management,  special  security  events  management, \ncounter-IED  response,  the  Hazardous  Devices  School,  and  the  Weapons  of  Mass \nDestruction/Render Safe program.    \n13.  As head of CIRG, Driscoll was the lead executive responsible for the FBI’s large-\nscale crisis response operations, domestically and internationally.  As part of this role, he was also \nresponsible for the development and execution of strategies that would minimize the country’s \nvulnerabilities to over-the-horizon future threats and mitigate risks to the safety of the American \npeople. \n14.  Prior to his role at CIRG, Driscoll was the Acting Director of the FBI.  He held the \nposition for approximately 31 days—from January 20, 2025 through February 20, 2025—until \nPatel was confirmed by the Senate.  In this role, Driscoll worked closely with FBI leadership and \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 6 of 68\n \nthe White House Transition Team.  His goals during this time were to maintain the stability of the \nFBI, protect the American people, and uphold the United States Constitution. \n15.  Before President Donald J. Trump’s January 20, 2025 inauguration, Driscoll was \nthe Special Agent in Charge (“SAC”) of the FBI’s Newark Field Office.  Before that, he had been \nserving as the Commander of the FBI’s HRT and the Section Chief of CIRG’s Tactical Section, \nresponsible for leading the FBI’s National Tactical Program to include all 55 field SWAT, crisis \nnegotiation, and operational medic teams.   \n16.  Driscoll entered on duty as a Special Agent with the FBI in December 2007.  Upon \ncompletion of training at the FBI Academy, he was assigned to the New York Organized Crime \nTask Force, where he worked on cases involving the organized crime syndicate La Cosa Nostra.  \nHe eventually became a member of the New York Office SWAT team.  \n17.  In March 2011, Driscoll was selected to be an operator on the FBI’s HRT.  With \nHRT, he served as an operator, sniper, and, ultimately, a Team Leader.  During his time with HRT, \nDriscoll deployed in support of FBI strategic priorities, to include both domestic and international \nhostage rescue missions and embedded assignments with Department of Defense (“DoD”) Special \nMissions Units.  For his courageous actions under fire on numerous tactical operations, the FBI \nhonored Driscoll with the Bureau’s Medal of Valor and Shield of Bravery awards.  \n18.  Driscoll’s Medal of Valor was related to his participation in a raid on ISIS operative \nAbu Sayyaf’s residence in Syria.  Sayyaf was a Tunisian citizen living in eastern Syria in May \n2015 suspected of kidnapping American citizen Kayla Mueller.  U.S. forces killed Sayyaf in the \nraid, detained his accomplice wife, and rescued a young Yezidi woman who had been enslaved by \nthe couple.  Driscoll’s actions while on target during the raid earned him this prestigious award. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 7 of 68\n \n19.  Driscoll’s Shield of Bravery was related to his neutralization of a domestic threat.  \nIn March 2013, a man named Kurt Meyers set fire to his home and went on a shooting spree in \nupstate New York, leaving four people dead and two others wounded before barricading himself \nin a local bar.  Driscoll was part of the responding FBI HRT operation.  When the HRT team \nbreached the building, the shooter opened fire with his shotgun, killing the HRT service dog.  \nDriscoll and his HRT team members, who had been following behind the service dog, swiftly \nengaged  and  neutralized  Meyers.    This  honor  is  particularly  significant  since  Driscoll  was \nrelatively new to the team at this point; one month before this event, he had participated in his very \nfirst HRT operation which resulted in the successful rescue of a five-year-old kindergartner who \nhad been kidnapped by an armed gunman in Alabama.   \n20.  In 2019, Driscoll returned to New York as a Supervisory Special Agent to establish \nand lead the Long Island Violent Crimes Task Force and the Long Island Child Exploitation and \nHuman Trafficking Task Force.  As a supervisor, he led his team to an exponential increase in \nprosecuting and preventing child exploitation and human trafficking matters.  \n21.  As a result of his extensive international counterterrorism experience, in 2020, \nDriscoll was transferred to New York’s Joint Terrorism Task Force (“JTTF”) to lead the FBI’s \nNorth Africa international terrorism investigations squad.  In this role, he integrated closely with \nthe United States Intelligence Community, DoD, and foreign law enforcement and intelligence \npartners  to  quickly  and  effectively  address  complex  counterterrorism  missions.    This  work \nincluded planning and participating in rapid overseas deployments in response to terrorist attacks \nand threats directed at the United States or its interests.   \n22.  In October 2020, Driscoll was promoted to Assistant Special Agent in Charge \n(“ASAC”) of the New York JTTF’s Extraterritorial Terrorism Branch, consisting of six squads \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 8 of 68\n \nand approximately 140 personnel to include Special Agents, Task Force Officers, analysts, and \nprofessional staff representing 61 state, local, federal and foreign partner agencies.  This branch \nwas responsible for leadership of global terrorism investigative and operational efforts in Africa, \nWestern Europe, the United Kingdom, and Canada.  \n23.  In 2021, Driscoll established and led the FBI’s international response to the vetting \nof the refugees evacuating Afghanistan in 2021.  With virtually no notice, he deployed overseas to \nhelp create enduring systems used by the U.S. interagency intelligence and defense apparatus that \nprotected  the  homeland  from  dangerous  actors  who  sought  to  take  advantage  of  any \ndisorganization following the Afghanistan withdrawal.   \n24.  Even  before  his  time  with  the  FBI,  Driscoll  was  committed  to  federal  law \nenforcement.  From 2004 to 2007, he served as a Special Agent with the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service, working counter-narcotics and undercover operations.   \n25.  Like  all  agents  in  today’s  FBI,  Driscoll  achieved  significant  academic \naccomplishments.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in English from Villanova University and a \nmaster’s degree in public policy and international relations from Pepperdine University.  \n26.  Driscoll became a member of the FBI’s Senior Executive Service (“SES”) in 2022 \nand remained so up until his unlawful firing.  Based on the amount of time he spent in federal \nservice, he would have been fully eligible to retire but could not do so until he turned 50.   \n27.  Plaintiff Steven J. Jensen is the former Assistant Director in Charge (“ADIC”) of \nthe Washington Field Office (“WFO”).  As ADIC, Jensen led the WFO from April 2, 2025, through \nhis termination on August 8, 2025.  One of the FBI’s largest offices, WFO is located in the nation’s \ncapital and serves as a critical hub for federal, state and local law enforcement coordination.  In \nthis role, Jensen oversaw approximately 2,000 employees and task force officers executing FBI \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 9 of 68\n \nmission priority investigations ranging from domestic and international terrorism, cyber and \ncounterintelligence, public corruption, white collar crime, transnational organized crime, and \nviolent crime within the capital region.  Due to WFO’s unique location, Jensen oversaw multiple \nspecialized units whose primary responsibility included safeguarding the nation’s capital from \nforeign and domestic threats, investigating threats against elected officials and critical incident \nresponse.  During his tenure, Jensen directed the multi-jurisdictional response to the attack at the \nNational Capital Jewish Museum, international deployments of FBI personnel to facilitate the \nForeign Transfer of Custody of priority terrorism subjects, and numerous high profile immigration \nenforcement arrests.   \n28.  Prior to his promotion as ADIC, Jensen served approximately two weeks as the \nFBI’s Director of Operations of National Security.  Prior to that role, Jensen was the SAC of the \nColumbia Field Office in South Carolina.  He served in that role from March 2023 until his transfer \nto FBI Headquarters in March 2025.   \n29.  Before his unlawful firing, Jensen spent nearly two decades serving the country as \nan FBI agent and supervisor.  He joined as a Special Agent in 2006 and was first assigned to the \nNew York Field Office where he investigated health care fraud, domestic terrorism, and organized \ncrime.  As a Special Agent, Jensen served on the SWAT team from 2009 through 2012 in which \ntime he served as an operator, sniper, and instructor.  While in this role, he participated in numerous \nhigh risk warrant operations, domestic and international dignitary protection details, and high-\nprofile witness protection.  For more than 16 years, he was certified as a firearms and defensive \ntactics instructor. \n30.  In 2012, Jensen was promoted to be a supervisory special agent instructor at the \nFBI Academy in Quantico, where he was responsible for instructing new agent trainees in the \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 10 of 68\n \npractical application of firearm skills.  In addition, Jensen established and maintained high \nstandards of performance and professionalism, serving as an example for aspiring special agents.  \nIn 2014, he was promoted to the Rockford Resident Agency of the Chicago Field Office to serve \nas the Supervisory Senior Resident Agent (“SSRA”).  The Rockford office’s jurisdiction covered \nthe 10 northwestern counties outside of Chicago.  As the SSRA, Jensen refocused his squad’s \ninvestigations to reduce violent crime, investigate public corruption, and target violent crimes \nagainst children.  Jensen built a violent crime task force—the first of its kind in the region—\ncombining the capabilities of multiple local agencies with the resources of the FBI, resulting in \nlocal joint press conferences and a town hall symposium on violent crime reduction hosted by \nCongressional representatives.  Jensen also oversaw critical incident response to law enforcement \nofficer line-of-duty death investigations, serial robbery investigations, and kidnapping-for-ransom \ninvestigations.  For his dedication to mission and leadership, Jensen was recognized by FBI \nChicago executive management with the FBI Medal of Excellence.   \n31.  In 2017, Jensen was named  ASAC for the Jackson Field Office in Jackson, \nMississippi.  As the ASAC, he oversaw the National Security, Criminal, and Administrative \nbranches of the Jackson Field Office, and received a second Medal of Excellence for exceptional \nleadership across multiple FBI programs.     \n32.  In 2020, Jensen was promoted into the SES as the Section Chief of the Domestic \nTerrorism Operations Section, Counterterrorism Division at FBI headquarters.  This section was \nprincipally  responsible  for  program  management  and  coordination  of  the  FBI’s  Domestic \nTerrorism investigative portfolio executed across the nation in its (then) 56 field offices.  In his \nrole as section chief, Jensen oversaw and coordinated routine domestic terrorism operations and \nprovided resources for field office response to critical incidents which included mass casualty \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 11 of 68\n \nevents, bombings, threats of bombings, threats against public officials, and threats to critical \ninfrastructure. \n33.  Beginning on January 6, 2021, the Domestic Terrorism Operations Section became \nthe focal point for all investigations related to the criminal activity stemming from the events of \nJanuary 6, 2021, at the United States Capitol.  Under Jensen’s leadership, this section was \nresponsible for providing coordinating instructions across all 56 (now 55) field offices and \nensuring all tips and leads were appropriately processed in a consistent manner.  Jensen held daily \ncoordination calls to provide recent updates and to allow WFO, the United States Attorney’s Office \nfor the District of Columbia, and DOJ leadership to identify trends, share intelligence, and update \nprosecutorial strategy and guidelines. \n34.  In October 2021, Jensen was promoted to the Deputy Assistant Director of the \nTraining Division, where he oversaw the day-to-day operations of all basic field training programs \nand National Academy curriculum.  The National Academy is an internationally renowned, highly \ncompetitive law enforcement leadership school, successful completion of which is often required \nfor local agency promotion into Deputy Chief or Chief positions.   \n35.  In 2023, Jensen was named the SAC of the Columbia Field Office in South \nCarolina.  In this role, he oversaw all FBI programs throughout the state of South Carolina and \nensured FBI priorities were worked effectively within the state.  He also served as the executive \nrepresentative of the FBI to local government officials, to include as an advisor on Governor Henry \nMcMaster’s Homeland Security Advisory Board.  At one point during Jensen’s tenure, the South \nCarolina Field Office was inspected by the FBI’s Inspection Division.  The inspection team’s focus \non leadership resulted in him receiving the highest rating ever for that field office, maximizing \nscoring in multiple competencies. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 12 of 68\n \n36.  Throughout his career, Jensen also served temporary duty assignments to the \nAttorney General Protection Detail, the Safe Streets Gang Program, and as the director of the High-\nValue  Detainee  Interrogation  Group  (“HIG”).    As  HIG  director,  he  oversaw  multi-agency \nresponses to interrogation deployments.  Intelligence gained from these interrogations during \nJensen’s tenure assisted DoD operations, FBI counterterrorism missions, and international partner \noperations.   \n37.  Prior to joining the FBI, Jensen was a police officer with the Colorado Springs \nPolice  Department.    Like  all  agents  in  today’s  FBI,  Jensen  achieved  significant  academic \naccomplishments.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Stony Brook University in \nNew York and a master’s degree in leadership studies from Northeastern University. \n38.  Jensen became a member of the FBI’s SES in 2020 and remained so up until his \nunlawful firing.  Based on the amount of time he spent in federal service, he would have been fully \neligible to retire but could not do so until he turned 50.   \n39.  Plaintiff Spencer L. Evans served in the FBI for over 20 years.  At the time of his \nunlawful firing, he was on administrative leave and in the process of transitioning from being the \nSAC of the Las Vegas Field Office in Nevada to the SAC of the Huntsville Field Office in \nAlabama. \n40.  He first joined the FBI in 2004 and maintained a sterling, unblemished record for \nover two decades.  Like Driscoll and Jensen, he had no performance issues or security violations.  \nSince 2004, Evans served in five separate field office assignments, including New Haven, San \nDiego, Oklahoma, Jacksonville, and Las Vegas.   \n41.  Throughout his career, Evans served as a case agent on countless narcotics, white \ncollar, and terrorism investigations.  He is also a certified crisis and hostage negotiator.  In that \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 13 of 68\n \nrole, he responded to international kidnappings of American citizens, including securing the \nrelease of multiple U.S. persons who had been kidnapped and held hostage by Mexican drug \ncartels.  \n42.  In August 2011, he was assigned to FBI Headquarters as a supervisor for the \nOrganized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program.  In 2013, he became a Unit Chief in the \nCounterterrorism Division in Washington, D.C.  Among other sensitive investigations, he served \nas  one  of  the  senior  leaders  at  FBI  Headquarters  during  the  Boston  Marathon  bombings \ninvestigation and prosecution.    \n43.  From approximately 2014 to 2016, Evans served as a field supervisor who oversaw \na JTTF and Child Exploitation Task Force.  From 2016 to 2019, Evans was an ASAC in Oklahoma. \nFollowing that assignment, he became the Section Chief of FBI’s Office of Private Sector from \napproximately 2019 to 2020, where he was also responsible for implementing a system of \nincreased information sharing between the FBI and private sector businesses in order to protect \ncritical American infrastructure from foreign spies and other criminals.  From there, he became an \nAssistant Deputy Director of the FBI’s Human Resources Division. \n44.  After leaving FBI Headquarters, Evans became the SAC of the FBI’s Las Vegas \nField Office.  Under his leadership, the FBI saw a dramatic increase in cooperation and partnership \nwith local law enforcement partners in the region, assigning new FBI employees to work directly \nwith  them  on  localized  investigations  and  assignments.    In  the  months  leading  up  to  his \ntermination, he oversaw the FBI investigation of the January 1, 2025 Tesla Cybertruck bombing \nin front of Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.  He further oversaw the March 2025 \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 14 of 68\n \ninvestigation into Tesla firebombing attacks in Las Vegas, which culminated in charges against \nthree individuals.2   \n45.  Shortly before his unlawful firing, Evans was elected as a representative to the FBI \nDirector’s Special Agent in Charge Advisory Committee.  He was chosen by his peers—that is, \nother SACs—to hold this position.  In fact, the Las Vegas Field Office was inspected by the FBI’s \nInspection Division in December 2024, and he received exemplary leadership scores.  It was noted \nthat his proactive support for, and engagement with, local law enforcement partners was a best \npractice to be emulated across the entire FBI. Evans has also received numerous incentive awards \nand was recognized by the Domestic Security Alliance Council as their 2024 recipient of the \nDistinguished Achievement Award. In August 2025, following his termination, he received a \ncommunity achievement award from the Asian American Group, which annually honors a law \nenforcement leader every year for keeping the Las Vegas community safe. \n46.  He is a graduate of the International Leadership in Counterterrorism Program, led \nby the “FVEY” or “Five Eyes,” the five-country multinational intelligence alliance between and \namong the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.   \n47.  Evans became a member of the FBI’s SES in 2019 and remained so up until his \nunlawful firing.  Based on the amount of time he spent in federal service, he would have been fully \neligible to retire once he turned 50.   \n48.  Prior to joining the FBI, Evans was a credit manager with Citigroup investment \nbank.  Like all agents in today’s FBI, Evans achieved significant academic accomplishments.  He \nearned  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  Brigham  Young  University  and  a  Master  of  Business \n \n2 DOJ Press Release, March 20, 2025, “Attorney General Pamela Bondi Announces Severe \nCharges Against Violent Tesla Arsonists,” available at https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-\ngeneral-pamela-bondi-announces-severe-charges-against-violent-tesla-arsonists. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 15 of 68\n \nAdministration from the University of Southern California.

FACTS3 \nA.  January 13-20, 2025: Recruitment of Brian Driscoll, Jr. to FBI Leadership \n \n55.  At the time of President Donald J. Trump’s January 20, 2025 inauguration, Driscoll \nwas the SAC of the FBI’s Newark, New Jersey Field Office.  Jensen was the SAC of the FBI’s \nColumbia, South Carolina Field Office.  Evans was the SAC of the FBI’s Las Vegas, Nevada Field \nOffice.  \n56.  At some point during the week of January 13, 2025, Driscoll received a phone call \nfrom retired FBI Special Agent (“SA”) Michael Clark.  Clark stated that he had established a \nrelationship with Patel while Clark was still an active SA and assigned as the primary case agent \nfor  the  Benghazi  terrorist  attack  investigation.    At  the  time,  Patel  was  assigned  to  DOJ’s \nCounterterrorism Section.  Clark stated that he had kept in touch with Patel and was now spending \na lot of time with him in an advisory role, prior to the inauguration.    \n57.  Clark also related that certain retired FBI SAs were also advising Patel in the lead \nup to the inauguration.  Clark asked if Driscoll would be willing to serve in an acting capacity at \nFBI Headquarters, though he did not specify in what role.  He also asked if Driscoll would be \nwilling to stay at FBI Headquarters permanently if Patel was confirmed as the FBI Director. \n58.  Driscoll responded to Clark by stating that if Patel was in a position of authority \nand confirmed, Driscoll would serve the men and women of the FBI, the office of the Director, \nand the office of the President.  Driscoll noted that his service would be to an “office,” not to a \npolitician who occupies an office.  Clark stated that he had also spoken to then-FBI SAC of the \nNew York Field Office, Robert Kissane, and had a similar conversation.  A few days after this \n \n3  The  facts  alleged  in  this  section  are  based  primarily  on  the  firsthand  knowledge,  best \nrecollections, and/or communications of and involving Plaintiffs.  Unless otherwise indicated with \nquotation marks, descriptions of conversations and other oral statements are reflected in sum and \nsubstance and to the best recollections of Plaintiffs. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 17 of 68\n \ninitial pre-inauguration call, Clark again called Driscoll and informed him that Patel was going to \ncall him.  A few minutes after this call, Patel called Driscoll.  Patel asked Driscoll if he would be \nwilling to serve at FBI Headquarters in an acting capacity and eventually stay at FBI Headquarters \npermanently if he (Patel) were to be confirmed.  Driscoll responded in the same manner he had \nresponded to Clark.  Patel then told Driscoll that he would receive a call from the Presidential \ntransition team for vetting purposes.  Driscoll asked what that process might entail.  Patel \nresponded that as long as Driscoll was not prolific on social media, did not donate to the \nDemocratic Party, and did not vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, the “vetting” would \nnot be an issue.  Driscoll did not respond to those comments.  In total, the conversation between \nPatel and Driscoll lasted less than five minutes.  Prior to this call, Driscoll had never met or spoken \nwith Patel. \n59.  Later that evening, Driscoll spoke to the then-Assistant Director in Charge of the \nFBI’s New York Office James Dennehy and Kissane to see if either man had additional details as \nto why Kissane and Driscoll were being requested to transfer to FBI Headquarters.  Kissane \narticulated that Clark “recommended” the two of them to Patel and Emil Bove, who Driscoll knew \nas a former Assistant United States Attorney in the United States Attorney’s Office for the \nSouthern District of New York.   \n60.  Driscoll  spoke  with  soon-to-be-Acting  FBI  Director  Paul  Abbate  that  night \nconcerning Patel’s entreaties to Driscoll and Kissane.  Abbate advised that he was relieved that \nKissane and Driscoll were being sought to serve at FBI Headquarters in some capacity, presumably \nas the acting Director and acting Deputy Director respectively.  Abbate advised that Driscoll and \nKissane should engage with Clark, Bove, and Patel, and accept leadership roles if offered. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 18 of 68\n \n61.  Approximately one to two days later, Driscoll received a call from Mr. Paul \nIngrassia, a White House representative who identified himself as the White House-DOJ transition \nliaison.  Ingrassia, then 29 years old, had no experience working in the White House, DOJ, or FBI.  \nNevertheless, he identified to Driscoll that he was on the White House-DOJ transition team and \nwanted to conduct a vetting interview with Driscoll who, according to Ingrassia, was being \nconsidered for “a high-level position at the FBI.”  Driscoll conferred with the FBI Newark Chief \nDivision Legal Counsel to confirm it was legally appropriate to call Ingrassia back.  After \nconfirming it was proper to do so, Driscoll then called Ingrassia back and left a voicemail. \n62.  The next day, on January 17, 2025, Ingrassia called Driscoll back and conducted a \ntelephonic interview.  Driscoll asked Ingrassia why he was being interviewed, to which Ingrassia \nreplied that it was for “a high-level position at the FBI.”  Driscoll responded that he was already \nserving in a high-level position in the FBI.  Ingrassia did not elaborate any further. The following \nis, in summary and substance, a list of the questions Ingrassia asked Driscoll and Driscoll’s \ncorresponding responses: \n \nQuestion 1:   How would you define the most significant threats to the United \nStates? \nResponse 1:   Cyber; terrorist; and counterintelligence threats posed by China;  \nRussia; Iran; North Korea; Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (“ISIS”); \nISIS-Khorasan  and  their  affiliates  with  external  operational \ncapabilities; porous borders; fentanyl; and transnational organized \ncrime, e.g., cartels.  \n \nQuestion 2:   What are your thoughts on the structure of the FBI? \nResponse 2:   In order to constantly improve, any organization needs to evolve and \nthe FBI is no exception.  Effective evolution with an improved or \nenhanced end state must be done with a measured and strategic \napproach.  The FBI can be more efficient, nimble, and field-focused \nwith a deep understanding of the nuanced complexities of each area \nof responsibility of each field office. \nQuestion 3:   Who did you vote for? \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 19 of 68\n \nResponse 3:  Driscoll refused to answer this question and stated that it was an \ninappropriate question with Hatch Act implications. \nQuestion 4:   Do you agree that the FBI agents who “stormed” Mar-a-Lago, to \ninclude the rank-and-file, should be held accountable? \nResponse 4:   No; FBI personnel were doing their job in furtherance of court \norders, legal warrants, and a properly predicated investigation. \nQuestion 5:   What are your thoughts on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? \nResponse 5:   Driscoll mentioned that members of his family were first-generation \ncitizens and that he strongly believes in diversity and a diverse \nworkforce that represents the people the FBI serves.  He noted that \nhe does not believe in promoting people for the sole reason of \ndiversity and did not support diluting standards for the sake of \ndiversity alone. \nQuestion 6:   When did you start supporting President Trump? \nResponse 6:   Driscoll refused to answer this question. \n \nQuestion 7:   Have you voted for a Democrat in the last five elections? \nResponse 7:   Driscoll refused to answer this question. \n \n63.  After this final question, Ingrassia ended the interview. \n64.  Later that evening, Driscoll received a call from Bove.  Driscoll understood that \nBove was expected to be named Acting Deputy Attorney General (“A/DAG”) of the United States \nfollowing the inauguration.  At the time of the call, Bove was a private lawyer who had been part \nof President Trump’s criminal defense team.  Bove asked Driscoll what happened on the vetting \ncall, to which Driscoll responded that he found Ingrassia’s questions to be highly inappropriate \nand political in nature and that he (Driscoll) was not supportive of serving in any leadership role \nin the FBI if it required him to pass a vetting assessment based on political views.  Driscoll noted \nthat he had never shared his political views, or even whether he had any, in his entire professional \ncareer.   \n65.  Bove told Driscoll that he “failed” the vetting interview and that Ingrassia reported \nthat Driscoll was combative and not “based out” enough.  Driscoll interpreted Ingrassia’s report to \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 20 of 68\n \nmean that his refusal to answer political questions disqualified him for the “high level position” for \nwhich he was being vetted.  He further interpreted Bove’s use of the term “based out” to mean that \nDriscoll failed to demonstrate sufficient alignment with and loyalty to the ideology advanced by \nPresident Trump’s political base. \n66.  Driscoll told Bove that he wanted nothing to do with the entire situation if it required \nhim to violate the law, and that not only was he apolitical by nature, but that it was essential for \nthe FBI to remain apolitical.   \n67.  Bove told Driscoll that during his (Bove’s) conversation with Ingrassia, Bove \nvouched for Driscoll’s character and stated that he was indeed a good fit for a senior role at FBI \nHeadquarters.  Bove also said that Ingrassia did not know how the government works and that he \nhad to explain to him that FBI agents cannot speak about their political views in their professional \ncapacity.  Bove said that he changed Ingrassia’s assessment and had the results “flipped” in favor \nof approving Driscoll to serve in an acting role at FBI Headquarters. \n68.  At this point, Driscoll asked Bove what position he would be asked to occupy, to \nwhich Bove replied that he would be asked to serve as the Acting Deputy Director of the FBI.  \nDriscoll stated that he would not agree to serve in such a capacity until someone in an official \nposition of authority in his chain of command requested him to do so.   \n69.  Bove related that, after President Trump named Bove A/DAG, Bove, in that \ncapacity, would appoint Kissane to serve as FBI Acting Director and Driscoll to serve as FBI \nActing Deputy Director.  Bove indicated that if Kissane or Driscoll refused to serve in the proposed \ncapacity, there was a strong chance that political appointees from outside of the FBI would serve \nin the roles.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 21 of 68\n \n70.  Driscoll told Bove that he would accept the role subject to two conditions: he would \nnot remove or terminate any FBI personnel at the behest of the incoming administration, and that \nhe would not be beholden to political influence or large-scale strategic structural change. \n71.  Bove expressed that Kissane and Driscoll were only being asked to serve in an \ninterim capacity until Patel was confirmed.  Bove continued that he would like the two men to \nfocus on keeping the momentum of the investigations and operations of the FBI going, and assured \nDriscoll that he would not ask Kissane or Driscoll to fire anybody. \n72.  The conversation concluded with the understanding that Kissane and Driscoll \nshould await a call on Sunday, January 19, 2025.  After receiving that call, they would drive down \nto Washington, D.C. and be prepared to assume the roles of FBI Acting Director and Acting Deputy \nDirector, respectively, beginning on January 20, 2025. \n73.  Driscoll updated Abbate on these developments. Abbate confirmed that he and \nKissane should follow the plan outlined by Bove.   \n74.  Driscoll drove from New York to Washington, D.C., on January 19, 2025. \n75.  On January 20, 2025, Driscoll received separate calls from both Bove and Abbate \nasking him to report immediately to FBI Headquarters to serve as the Acting Deputy Director.  \nDriscoll arrived that day at around 1:00 p.m. and met with Abbate, then-FBI Chief of Staff Corey \nEllis, then-FBI Deputy Chief of Staff William Miller, and other professional staff.  Kissane arrived \nshortly thereafter. \n76.  Abbate informed Kissane and Driscoll that he was retiring, effective immediately.  \nHe conducted a brief turnover, mostly consisting of staff introductions and situational awareness.  \nAs Abbate, Kissane, and Driscoll were sitting in the FBI Director’s Conference Room, Ellis came \nin and dropped  a printed copy of the White  House report announcing government interim \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 22 of 68\n \ncomponent heads. \n77.  The report listed Driscoll as Acting Director, rather than Kissane.  This was the \nreverse of what the two men had previously discussed with Bove and Abbate.  Perplexed, the group \ndecided that Kissane should call Bove and ask what had happened and if it could be rectified.  \nKissane left the room to call Bove, who was by then at DOJ as the A/DAG.  He returned a short \ntime later, pointed at Driscoll, and said that he was the new Acting Director of the FBI.   \n78.  Kissane related that Bove called the White House to fix what everyone collectively \nunderstood to be a mistake.  Bove told Kissane that it was a clerical error but that the White House \nwas unwilling to fix it.  As a result, Driscoll was now the Acting Director and Kissane was the \nActing Deputy Director.  Ellis asked Driscoll and Kissane if this change was acceptable to them, \nto which they explained that they had been friends and colleagues for over 17 years and that they \nwere committed to protecting the FBI mission and its people, regardless of what title they each \nheld.  \nB.  Brian Driscoll’s Service as Acting Director of the FBI \n \n79.  Upon assuming their new roles, Driscoll and Kissane established a cadence of daily \ninternal FBI briefings and DOJ briefings.  Each morning, they convened a briefing that included \nthe FBI leadership team.  Those briefings were operational in nature, to include high-level threat \nand intelligence briefs.  Following that brief, the participants reduced to a smaller group (based on \nsecurity clearance levels) to receive another daily brief.  Following these meetings, Kissane, \nDriscoll, Ellis, William Miller, and others would go to DOJ to brief then-Acting Attorney General \nJames McHenry and Bove on investigative, operational, and threat matters.  Bove led discussion \nat these meetings and occasionally asked for “stay behind” meetings with Driscoll and Kissane.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 23 of 68\n \n80.  During the week of January 20th, Driscoll learned that DOJ had directly hired \npersonnel into the FBI to serve as Patel’s “Director’s Advisory Team” (“DAT”) in advance of \nPatel’s confirmation as FBI Director.  The DAT referred to themselves as “politicals” in reference \nto them being politically appointed.  Some of these members were retired FBI agents, including \nGreg Menser, Tom Ferguson, and others. \n81.  That week, Driscoll held a meeting with members of the DAT and stated that they \nwere not allowed to refer to themselves as “politicals” because the FBI is an apolitical entity and, \nas Acting Director, Driscoll would not tolerate any reference to the contrary.  Driscoll asked them \ntheir responsibilities, to which they said they had been installed to help advise the future Director, \nmeaning Patel, on how to refine the organization’s structure, technical capacity, and leadership \ndevelopment and selection.  \n82.  Over the coming weeks, Driscoll only met once or twice with members of the DAT.  \nAt one meeting with Mesner, which Kissane also attended, Menser provided a list of names and \nfield offices to Driscoll, and indicated the people listed were marked to be removed or terminated.  \nDriscoll informed Menser that he refused to terminate people on the basis of this list. Driscoll \ncontinued that, if Menser was delivering this message on behalf of Patel, he should tell Patel that \nDriscoll did not work for him yet. \n1.  Emil Bove’s Pressure Campaign and Attempt to Purge the FBI  \n83.  On or about January 27, 2025, Bove requested that Driscoll and Kissane “stay \nbehind” following their daily morning briefing.  At that “stay behind” meeting, Bove stated that \nhe was receiving pressure from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller to see \n“symmetrical action at the FBI as had been happening at DOJ.”   Bove made clear that he and \nMiller wanted to see personnel action like reassignment, removals, and terminations at the FBI, \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 24 of 68\n \nsimilar to the firings and reassignments of senior attorneys at DOJ that had occurred since January \n20, 2025.   \n84.  Driscoll and Kissane responded that if there was an allegation of misconduct, they \nwould  initiate  an  investigative  process  through  the  appropriate  divisions,  including  FBI \nInspections Division, Office of Professional Responsibility, and/or DOJ’s Office of Inspector \nGeneral.  They affirmed that if the investigations into any FBI employee accused of misconduct \nyielded results, they would enforce appropriate consequences based on policy and law. \n85.  In response, Bove asserted that an allegation of misconduct was not necessary for \nhim to terminate FBI personnel of his choosing and at his discretion.  Bove stated that he intended \nto terminate FBI personnel if he subjectively felt a “loss of confidence in their ability to carry out \nthe President’s agenda.”  He also did not address why directives to fire FBI personnel were coming \nfrom the White House. \n86.  Driscoll and Kissane re-emphasized the necessity for a process, as previously \narticulated.  Bove repeated that his own unilateral assessment that he had lost faith and confidence \nin an employee’s ability to carry out the President’s political agenda was sufficient. \n87.  Throughout the week of January 27, 2025, Bove made several demands for FBI \ninvestigative squad rosters in the Las Vegas, Miami, and Washington Field Offices, which Driscoll \nunderstood to be for the purpose of summary terminations.  Driscoll and Kissane did not provide \nthose rosters.    \n88.  On or about January 28, 2025, at the DOJ “stay behind” meeting, Bove expressly \nstated his intent to summarily remove specific individuals in leadership roles at the FBI.  When \nDriscoll and Kissane asked who he was referring to and why, Bove said he was referring to the \nAssociate Deputy Director, ADIC of WFO, the SAC of Miami, various Executive Assistant \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 25 of 68\n \nDirectors (“EADs”), and potentially the SAC of Las Vegas and SAC of New Orleans.  Bove did \nnot refer to the SAC of Las Vegas by name, only the position.  Evans then occupied the position.   \n89.  When Driscoll and Kissane asked whether there was a lawful basis for firing these \nemployees, Bove referred to his lack of confidence that they would carry out the President’s \nagenda.  Bove again brought up the pressure he was receiving from Miller to conduct summary \nfirings of agents as had been done with respect to DOJ attorneys.   \n90.  Driscoll and Kissane communicated that neither man would terminate any of these \nindividuals, to which Bove responded that he (Bove) would be terminating them.  Driscoll \nexpressed his disagreement with the proposed terminations and urged that these individuals \ndeserved dignity and respect for their service.  He also argued that if Bove insisted on terminating \nthese individuals, the ones who were eligible to retire should be given the opportunity to do so, and \nthe ones ineligible to retire should be given the opportunity to either step down in rank or accept a \nmanagement directed reassignment, thus keeping them employed.  \n91.  Driscoll convinced Bove to allow Driscoll one week to apprise the impacted \nindividuals of their options in advance of an expected firing.  During a series of discussions with \nthe impacted individuals, Driscoll and Kissane expressed their disagreement with the approach \ntaken by DOJ and assured that any individual who elected to retire instead of being fired would be \nprocessed in an expedited manner to ensure that a sooner-than-expected firing would not affect \ntheir eligibility for retirement benefits.   \n92.  On or about January 29, 2025, at the “stay behind” morning meeting at DOJ offices, \nBove instructed Driscoll and Kissane to provide a list of FBI personnel associated with the \ninvestigations into the January 6, 2021 attacks at the Capitol.  At times during the discussion, Bove \nmade reference to a “core case team” of January 6 investigators, which did not actually exist.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 26 of 68\n \nDriscoll explained to Bove that the investigations and prosecutions arising from the January 6, \n2021 attacks were a DOJ-led effort and included thousands of participants in the FBI, all of whom \nwere doing their jobs pursuant to a predicated investigation.  Driscoll explained that a mass firing \nof FBI personnel who worked on January 6 matters would not be in accordance with FBI \nprocedures and would put national security at risk.  He further stated that he would not tolerate \nsuch  an  action  without  an  articulated  reason  and  compliance  with  existing  due  process \nrequirements.  \n93.  To emphasize the magnitude and breadth of Bove’s request, Driscoll explained that \nDriscoll himself would be on the list.  He also explained that if that list were ever leaked or made \npublic, the affected FBI employees would potentially face threats, physical and/or otherwise.  In \nresponse, Bove said he believed there was “cultural rot” within the FBI.  \n94.  Driscoll and Kissane asked Bove what he intended to do with the list of January 6 \nFBI personnel, to which he responded the personnel detailed therein would be subject to a DOJ \nreview for misconduct.  When asked what process would be used to conduct the review, Bove \nwould not provide any other response other than “a DOJ-led review,” which Driscoll believed \nwould consist of DOJ’s assessment as to whether an employee supported the President’s political \nagenda.   \n95.  Driscoll and Kissane told Bove that unless he could outline a lawful process for \ndetermining whether and how people would be fired, they did not intend to provide a list of names \nof employees.   \n96.  Instead of providing a lawful reason, Bove responded that (1) he was above Driscoll \nand Kissane in the chain-of-command, (2) he was giving them a direct order to provide the list of \nnames,  and  (3)  he  could  terminate  FBI  personnel  even  in  the  absence  of  an  allegation  of \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 27 of 68\n \nmisconduct. \n97.  Only after seeking counsel from the FBI’s Office of General Counsel, Driscoll \ninitiated the process for compiling a list of certain FBI personnel involved in the investigations \nand prosecutions concerning the January 6, 2021 attacks. However, the FBI had neither the \ntechnological nor personnel resources to gather the requested information with 100% accuracy \nwithin the abbreviated timeline mandated by DOJ.   Nevertheless, Bove demanded the incomplete \nand inaccurate list to use as a starting point for future terminations.   \n98.  On or about January 30, 2025, Driscoll and Kissane informed Bove that the \nunsigned “Fork in the Road” email from the Office of Personnel Management, which encouraged \nfederal employees to opt into voluntary resignation rather than be summarily terminated, as well \nas the media coverage stating that all probationary government employees would possibly face \ntermination, was causing panic and anxiety in the FBI workforce and putting the FBI’s mission, \nand thus the safety of Americans, at risk.   Bove stated that the creation of panic and anxiety in the \nworkforce “was the intent.” \n99.  On Friday, January 31, 2025, Bove issued a memo addressed to Driscoll with the \nsubject line, “Terminations.”  The memo set a deadline of February 3, 2025 at 5:30 p.m. to \neffectuate terminations of eight specified FBI employees and to deliver the list of “all current and \nformer FBI personnel assigned at any time to investigations and/or prosecutions relating to” \nJanuary 6 and United States v. Haniyeh et al., 24 Mag. 438 (S.D.N.Y.), a case charging senior \nleaders of the terrorist group Hamas. \n100.  On February 3, 2025, at the DOJ “stay behind” meeting, Bove again expressed his \nview that there was “cultural rot” at the FBI and said that he issued the January 31, 2025 memo re: \n“Terminations” with a list of expanded scope because Driscoll and Kissane would not provide a \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 28 of 68\n \n“core January 6 team” and had refused to summarily terminate the EADs and others.  Bove’s \ndiscussion with Driscoll and Kissane led Driscoll to believe that Bove was well that aware nobody \non the “Terminations” list had been provided with any proper notice or an opportunity to respond \nto any allegation and that there was no legitimate cause or alleged misconduct that had led to the \nterminations. \n101.  Later that day and prior to the 5:30 p.m. deadline, the FBI’s acting Chief of Staff \nprovided the latest version of the compiled list to DOJ.  At Driscoll’s direction, the listed \nemployees were identified by Universal Employee Identification Number—not by name—in an \neffort to protect the identities of the employees if the list was exposed.  The list included \napproximately 6,000 employees and was sent to Bove via email over the FBI’s unclassified enclave \nwith necessary caveats. \n102.  Beginning on approximately January 30, 2025, media coverage of Bove’s efforts \nto terminate people based solely on politics and prior case assignments began to escalate.  At no \npoint in Driscoll’s more than 20-year career in federal law enforcement—with the exception of a \nsingle official telephonic interview with Fox Digital that had been coordinated, approved, and \nmonitored by the FBI Office of Press Affairs regarding the arrest of an FBI Top Ten fugitive while \nhe was Acting Director—has he ever provided a comment to the press in any form or fashion.  \n103.  On or about February 5, 2025, Driscoll returned to his office at FBI Headquarters \nfollowing the DOJ daily morning brief.  His executive assistant (“EA”) handed him a printed copy \nof an email from Bove, addressed to the entire FBI workforce.  \n104.  Driscoll found this confusing, since he did not receive the email himself.  His EA \nthen explained that Bove had attempted to email the entire FBI workforce, but had failed because \nhe was not actually an FBI employee and therefore could not send the email through the FBI \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 29 of 68\n \ncomputer systems.  Driscoll then read the email, which, among other things, accused him of \ninsubordination and refusing to comply with Bove’s orders.  For example, in an attempt to explain \nwhy he demanded the names of any employee who worked on January 6 investigations, Bove \nwrote: \nThe purpose of the requests was to permit the Justice Department to conduct a \nreview of those particular agents’ conduct pursuant to President Trump’s Executive \nOrder concerning weaponization in the prior administration. FBI acting leadership \nrefused to comply. That insubordination necessitated, among other things, the \ndirective  in  my  January  31,  2025  memo  to  identify  all  agents  assigned  to \ninvestigations relating to January 6, 2021. \n \n105.  Understanding Bove’s intent to communicate with the FBI’s workforce on his own \nwithout Driscoll’s knowledge, Driscoll instructed his EA to arrange for the exact words of Bove’s \nemail to be sent to the workforce, from Driscoll, on Bove’s behalf.  That was achieved a short time \nlater that day.   \n106.  In the days that followed, Driscoll and Kissane communicated with the workforce \non various investigative, operational, and personnel matters in order to provide stability for \nongoing FBI operations.  To Driscoll and Kissane, this seemed particularly important at a time \nwhen, as Bove had previously put it, stoking panic and anxiety within federal law enforcement and \nother federal agencies “was the intent.”  \n107.  Intense media coverage of the FBI continued, but Driscoll never spoke to any media \nof any kind.  At some point in February 2025, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and \n“Border Czar” Tom Homan publicly accused members of the FBI of leaking sensitive law \nenforcement information regarding immigration enforcement operations.  As a result, the FBI \ninitiated a thorough insider threat investigation, which concluded that the accusations were false. \n108.  On or about February 12, 2025, at the daily DOJ “stay behind” meeting, Bove \naccused Driscoll and Kissane of leaking information about their daily meetings to the media and \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 30 of 68\n \n“controlling” the negative media attention that had been directed at Bove in recent weeks.  Driscoll \ntruthfully stated that neither he nor Kissane had leaked any information about their daily meetings, \nand that any suggestion otherwise was completely inaccurate.  He reiterated that the FBI was \ncontinuing  to  investigate  all  leaks,  including  potential  leaks  concerning  recent  immigration \nenforcement operations, and that there was no evidence that anyone at the FBI was responsible for \nany such leaks.  Bove responded that he considered Driscoll to be a bad leader and that he trusted \nneither he nor Kissane, nor any FBI internal leak investigation.  \n109.  Bove sought to assign blame to Driscoll for the negative morale in the FBI \nworkforce, notwithstanding that the instability within the FBI had been specifically instigated by \nBove’s threat of summary firings and mass probationary agent firings.  Bove had confirmed as \nmuch when he had stated that the very “intent” of these actions was to cause panic and anxiety.    \n110.  Bove’s efforts did, however, create a groundswell of support within the FBI for \nDriscoll’s and Kissane’s leadership.  Rank-and-file agents appeared to appreciate that the two men \nwere the reasons the country had not been catapulted into a national security emergency brought \non by suspected mass firings at the FBI.  Bove told Driscoll that he was angry that, in parody \nvideos apparently created by FBI employees, Bove was portrayed as the Batman villain “Bane,” \nwhile Driscoll was portrayed as “Batman.”   Driscoll responded that he did not make the video, \nnor could he control unknown individuals’ feelings or expressions of said feelings.  \n111.  Bove responded that Driscoll could have told the FBI’s workforce that Driscoll \ntrusted him.  Bove then stated that he and now-confirmed Attorney General Pam Bondi were going \nto have an in-person meeting with Patel later that afternoon to discuss “what they were going to do \nwith Kissane and Driscoll.”  Both Driscoll and Kissane reiterated that they had not engaged in \n“leaking” and had not spoken to the media about the daily DOJ meetings.   Bove responded that \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 31 of 68\n \nhe did not trust the men.  \n2.  Transition of FBI Leadership to Mr. Patel \n112.  Prior to Patel’s confirmation, Driscoll and Kissane oversaw the FBI’s background \ninvestigations of individuals nominated for positions within the Administration.  On or about \nFebruary 12, 2025, Bove told Kissane and Driscoll to pause any FBI background investigations, \nexplaining that the background investigations would resume after Patel was confirmed because \nPatel would be more accountable to Bove.    \n113.  On February 20, 2025, Patel was confirmed as the ninth Director of the FBI.  Later \nthat evening, he arrived in the Director’s Office and was provided a brief tour of his office and \nother spaces by members of his staff.  He had a brief private conversation with Driscoll, thanked \nhim for his service as Acting Director, and stated that Driscoll was placed in “an impossible \nsituation.”  He then asked Driscoll to make a list of poor leaders within the FBI, to which Driscoll \nstated that he would not be the “judge, jury, and executioner.”  \n114.  Driscoll explained to Patel the multiple FBI processes to determine the strengths and \nweaknesses of FBI leaders.  Patel asked where Driscoll wanted to go within the FBI, to which \nDriscoll stated that he was not ready to commit to any particular position at that time.  He told \nPatel that he intended to take some leave to spend time with his family, to which Patel stated that \nhe understood and supported him.  \n115.  At the conclusion of the conversation, Driscoll said goodbye to staff members and \nhis protection detail, then drove himself home. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 32 of 68\n \nC.  Steven Jensen Becomes ADIC of WFO \n1.  Patel Recruits Jensen back to Washington, D.C. \n116.  At some point between late February and early March, Jensen received a call from \nPatel.  At the time, Jensen was the SAC of the FBI’s Columbia Field Office in South Carolina.  \nJust a few years before that, Jensen had left his position as the chief of the Counterterrorism Section \nat FBI Headquarters where he had overseen domestic terrorism investigations, including the FBI’s \ninvestigation into the January 6 cases.   \n117.  In this initial conversation, Patel said that multiple people had recommended he \nreach out to Jensen and to consider him as a possible leader during Patel’s time as Director.  Jensen \nand Patel discussed the former’s approach to the January 6 investigations.  Specifically, Jensen \nexplained that his section coordinated between the lead investigative office (WFO), DOJ, and the \nother 55 field offices who were receiving leads, tips, and collecting evidence pursuant to properly \npredicated investigations.  His goal, he told Patel, was to ensure consistency across multiple and \ndisparate areas of responsibility while meeting the needs and demands of DOJ prosecutorial \ndecisions.   \n118.  Patel asked if Jensen had ever pushed back against DOJ leadership running the \ninvestigations.  Jensen responded that he often advocated that investigative focus should be on \nthose who committed acts of violence against law enforcement, damaged or stole government \nproperty, and on the genesis of the pipe bombs found that day, not on lower-level offenses like \ntrespass.  However, FBI agents are limited in how to control the prosecution of a case, and charging \ndecisions ultimately rest with attorneys at the DOJ.   \n119.  A few weeks after this phone call, on or about March 12, 2025, Patel again called \nJensen.  In this second phone call, Patel told Jensen that he had verified some of the information \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 33 of 68\n \nthat Jensen told him and asked him if he would become the FBI Branch and Operations Director \nof National Security.  Jensen hesitated, noting that this would be a significant “leapfrog” of other \nFBI colleagues who worked at headquarters since Jensen was then the SAC of a relatively small \nfield office.  Patel said it was not a problem and that Jensen was exactly the man he wanted for the \njob.  Jensen accepted the position and reported back to Washington, D.C. to assume his new \nresponsibilities on March 17, 2025. \n120.  For approximately two weeks, Jensen served as the FBI’s Operations Director of \nNational Security with direct oversight of 16 SACs.  He had daily interactions with Patel and FBI \nDeputy Director Dan Bongino, who had started in his position on March 17, 2025.  Within \napproximately one week, both Patel and Bongino had separate, one-on-one meetings with Jensen \nto tell him that they wanted him to become ADIC of the FBI’s WFO.  Both Patel and Bongino \nindicated that they needed a “leader” to take control of that particular field office.  Bongino had \ndescribed the position to Jensen as the “fourth most powerful position in the FBI.” \n121.  By approximately March 26, 2025, both men had separately indicated to Jensen \ntheir desire to have him become the highest-ranking agent at the WFO.  As ADIC, he would be \nable to install five Special Agents in Charge as subordinate leaders in the office.  Accordingly, by \nApril 2, 2025, just over two weeks after returning to Washington, D.C. to become the Operations \nDirector, Jensen left that position and arrived at WFO as the ADIC.  \n122.  Jensen’s promotion to ADIC at WFO set off a social media firestorm.  Former \nJanuary 6 defendants and their sympathizers immediately recognized him as having played a \nleading role in their criminal investigations.  Subscribing to President Trump’s position that the \nFBI  investigators  who  were  assigned  to  January  6  cases  were  “[t]hugs”,  “[t]yrants,”  and \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 34 of 68\n \n“Gestapo,”4 January 6 rioters and their sympathizers began aggressively posting to Patel and \nBongino’s social media pages calling for Jensen’s firing or other retribution.   \n123.  Bongino was apparently unaware of Jensen’s past work at the Counterterrorism \nSection.  On the Saturday following Jensen’s promotion, Bongino called Jensen directly to ask \nhim whether the things people were saying online were true, citing the vitriol he had been receiving \non his social media pages.  Jensen responded that he did indeed serve as the Section Chief of the \nDomestic Terrorism Operations Section and coordinated the FBI’s response to the January 6 \ninvestigations, that this was not new information, and that it was part of his publicly available FBI \nbiography and official personnel file.  \n124.  Neither Patel nor Bongino appeared to have anticipated the backlash from President \nTrump’s political base, who frequently tagged members of the Executive Office of the President \nin their angry online posts.  As the online clamor among sympathizers of January 6 defendants \ngrew, Patel suggested to Jensen that he (Patel) was counteracting some of the negative attention \nby placing positive stories in the media about Jensen’s promotion.   \n125.  Both Patel and Bongino lamented to Jensen that they were spending “a lot of \npolitical capital” to keep him in the ADIC position, a position that Jensen had not sought in the \nfirst place.   \n126.  The online backlash to Jensen’s promotion from President Trump’s political base \nwas significant.  In sum, that backlash expressed that Jensen should be fired or arrested for his \nparticipation in the January 6 investigations, and that Patel and Bongino had made a politically \n \n4  See  @realDonaldTrump,  Truth  Social,  available  at \nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109745175533954622 [https://perma.cc/Y9Y9-\nE8HL];  @realDonaldTrump,  Truth  Social,  available  at \nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109529028482982758  [https://perma.cc/F728-\nA87A]. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 35 of 68\n \npoor choice by promoting him.  Frequently, critics of Jensen’s promotion would “tag” Patel and \nBongino in an attempt to bring their displeasure to those individuals’ attention.5 \n127.  In response, Patel urged Jensen to sue the more prominent online personalities for \ndefamation.6   Doing so, Patel explained, would help take the political pressure off of him (Patel) \nfor his decision to promote Jensen.  Patel even offered to connect Jensen with defamation \nattorneys.  Jensen declined, noting that he was unconcerned with the viewpoints of online \npersonalities and would remain focused on the FBI’s mission.   \n128.  Despite  Patel  and  Bongino  telling  Jensen  that  his  promotion  had  cost  them \n“political capital,” Jensen continued to have a cordial and professional relationship with both men \nduring his time as ADIC of WFO.  He regularly updated Bongino on investigations that Bongino \nconsidered priorities, including into the January 6 pipe bomber, the leak of the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215 (2022), and the \ndiscovery of cocaine at the White House during the Biden Administration, which were three cases \nthat Bongino frequently discussed in media interviews and on his social media feed.  \n129.  During these briefings, Jensen became alarmed at Bongino’s intense focus on \nincreasing  online  engagement  through  his  social  media  profiles  in  an  effort  to  change  his \nfollowers’ perception of the FBI.  Jensen was concerned that the emphasis Bongino placed on \ncreating content for his social media pages could risk outweighing more deliberate analyses of \ninvestigations.   \n \n5 In general terms, to “tag” another person on social media means to hyperlink another user’s \naccount to specific content, which triggers a notification to that user’s account and increases the \nvisibility of the post. \n6 Although Patel and Jensen did not discuss this, one of the online personalities Patel suggested \nJensen sue had coincidentally also been fixated on Plaintiff Spencer Evans, as discussed in further \ndetail herein. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 36 of 68\n \n130.  At some point in May 2025, Jensen received a phone call from Bongino, who was \naudibly upset.  He asked Jensen whether he knew who SA Walter Giardina was and told Jensen \nthat he has “got to go.” Giardina was an agent assigned to WFO.  Jensen asked him to elaborate, \nbut Bongino explained that he could not do so over the phone.  Jensen met him at FBI Headquarters \nto continue the discussion.  Jensen knew Giardina to be a dedicated and hardworking FBI agent \nwho was assigned to high-profile investigations into members of both political parties because of \nthese qualities.   \n131.  Upon arriving at FBI Headquarters, Jensen found Bongino in his Chief of Staff’s \noffice.  Bongino looked as if he had not slept for several days.  He seemed extremely anxious and \nagitated.  Jensen asked him what was wrong.  Bongino explained that he had found a room filled \nwith  classified  documents  and  “burn  bags”  related  to  the  now-closed  Crossfire  Hurricane \ninvestigation.  He expressed shock at the existence of these burn bags.   \n132.  By his comments, it seemed to Jensen that Bongino might not have been fully aware \nthat the use of “burn bags” is a standard method across multiple federal agencies for preparing \nclassified material for destruction when an investigation is deemed closed, or when physical copies \nof the materials are no longer necessary.  He also appeared unaware that the FBI also stored digital \ncopies of materials on the FBI’s classified computer system, and that this was likely the case with \nthese materials. At the meeting, Bongino also made an unfounded additional allegation about \nGiardina’s handling of data, claiming that the allegation was “just out there.” \n133.  Bongino insisted that Jensen summarily fire Giardina.  Jensen explained that \nGiardina was a military veteran and was entitled to certain rights which did not allow such a firing.  \nHe explained that if Bongino forced him to summarily fire Giardina, he would document in a report \nthat the firing was at the direction of Bongino and had occurred after Jensen explained why the \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 37 of 68\n \nfiring violated FBI procedures and Giardina’s rights.  He explained that Bongino would likely be \ndeposed in a lawsuit should Giardina choose to challenge his unlawful firing.  Bongino did not \npursue further his demand that Giardina be summarily fired in that meeting.  In fact, Giardina was \nnever assigned to work on Crossfire Hurricane. \n134.  Shortly after this meeting, Patel and Bongino sat for an interview with Maria \nBartiromo of Fox News.  Bongino then publicly discussed the topics that he and Jensen had \nprivately spoken about.  Patel publicly defended him during the interview and extolled his \nembodiment of FBI values: \nMs. Bartiromo:  You promoted Steven Jensen, the architect of the FBI’s \noverzealous January 6 investigation.   \n \nPatel:  I want the American public to realize what we did. That man \nwas in a position where he literally fought back against the \nmachine who was saying, “we want to politicize this event, \nwe want to politicize this event.”  And at the end of the day, \nremember, Maria, there’s a chain of command here.  So you \ncan fight back your chain of command to a certain degree \nbefore they fire you.  And Steven Jensen and other folks \nwere promoted because they embody what the American \npublic demands of FBI agents.7   \n \n135.  Jensen maintained a professional relationship with both men over the next few \nmonths and ensured that they were updated on matters of national security.  For example, on the \nday of a horrific double homicide and attempted mass casualty event at the Capital Jewish Museum \nin Washington, D.C., Jensen woke Bongino up during the night to inform him of the situation and \nprovide him with updates.  Bongino arrived at the scene and then sat with Jensen at the FBI \ncommand post set up to respond to the event.  The men also attended a press conference on the \nevent with then-Acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro.  After \n \n7 Maria Bartiromo, Fox News, May 18, 2025, “Wave of Transparency: FBI director hints at \nagency’s  move  to  rebuild  American’s  trust,”  available  at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqI_sFSPbJQ. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 38 of 68\n \nthe press conference, Bongino sent Jensen a text message commending him for his response to the \nevent and stating that “this is why we put you in place.”   \n2.  July 2025: Patel praises and rewards Jensen \n136.  On July 14, 2025, Jensen attended a regularly scheduled meeting with Patel in the \nDirector’s Conference Room along with the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives \nand Marshall Yates, the Assistant Director of Congressional Affairs, to discuss security issues.  \nAfter discussing specific security matters, Patel told Jensen that his recommendations on the issues \nwere “great” and that he intended to implement them.   \n137.  At the close of the meeting, Patel warmly invited Jensen into his office, which was \nconnected to the conference room.  \n138.  Jensen then asked Patel for what he described as a favor.  He knew that Patel \nplanned to disclose Giardina’s name in an unredacted report to Congress. Giardina had been \nassigned to multiple investigations into suspected criminal activity by President Trump and, as \nsuch, was the target of political retribution by the White House.  In the records Patel planned to \ndisclose to Congress, Patel intended to leave unredacted only Giardina’s name, notwithstanding \nthat Giardina had been an apolitical investigator and that other agents’ names within the document \nwould remain redacted.  Jensen observed that Patel’s planned disclosure would ignite and direct \nattention specifically to Giardina. \n139.  Jensen explained that Giardina’s wife was very ill, suffering from Stage IV cancer, \nand had days to live.  Because Jensen believed that Patel was under intense political pressure from \nthe White House and Congress to identify and punish FBI agents perceived as politically disloyal \nto President Trump and that Giardina’s name was going to be disclosed, Jensen asked Patel if he \nwould delay the public disclosure until after Giardina had time to deal with his wife’s illness and \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 39 of 68\n \nlikely passing.  Yates was present for this interaction.   \n140.  Because of his reputation for being a hard worker and thorough investigator, \nGiardina had been assigned to multiple high-profile cases involving prominent members of both \npolitical parties, including President Trump.  As should have been clear to Patel and any other FBI \nofficial, any disclosure of the name of an FBI agent who worked a case involving President Trump \nwould immediately trigger a torrent of online abuse and threats of violence.  In Jensen’s opinion, \nfor Giardina and his family to have to deal with this during such an emotional time seemed \ninexcusably cruel.   \n141.  As Jensen got up to leave, Patel called him back and said he wanted to show him \nsomething.  He presented Jensen with a Director’s “challenge coin” that Patel said he had just \nordered.  Such challenge coins—tokens of appreciation given by leaders to their subordinates in \ngovernment and military environments—are typically the size of a silver dollar.  The coin \nproffered by Patel, however, was much larger, inscribed with “Director” at the top banner of the \ncoin and “Ka$h Patel” at the bottom banner.  Patel told Jensen that he wanted him to be one of the \nfirst recipients of his new challenge coin. \n142.  Jensen then noticed collection of whiskey bottles and cigars on Patel’s desk.  He \nasked if he was a collector.  Patel then gave him two cigars, telling Jensen that they were \n“awesome” and that he has “gotta see this.”  Patel explained that he used to produce his own brand \nof cigars, but they are not in production anymore.  He then gave Jensen a third cigar but said that \nhe should not smoke it because it was from President Trump’s inauguration.  Jensen asked whether \nPatel was sure he wanted to gift Jensen a cigar of such significance for Patel, particularly since \nJensen himself did not attend President Trump’s inauguration.  Patel insisted that Jensen should \ntake it.  As Jensen walked out of the Director’s office, Patel told him to enjoy his leave, that he \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 40 of 68\n \nshould take as much time as he needs, to take care of his family, and that he was “crushing it.”   \n143.  Approximately two days into his leave, on July 16, 2025, at approximately 7:20 \na.m., Jensen received a call from Bongino.  Bongino began the call by sternly telling Jensen that \nhe had to “use better judgment,” explaining that the SAC of the Philadelphia Field Office had sent \nout an email to various other SACs about the SAC Advisory Committee indicating that Jensen \nwould assume the vice chair position that had been left vacant by the recent departure of the \nRichmond SAC.  The SAC Advisory Committee is an organizational structure within the FBI that \nSACs from across the country rely on to channel communication and concerns to FBI leadership.  \nIt is not a formal organization and is, in effect, an additional duty for those who volunteer for the \nposition.  The Philadelphia SAC had asked Jensen to fill the vacancy left by the Richmond SAC \nand, apparently, Bongino had learned of an email announcing this. \n144.  During this phone call, Bongino warned him that if the White House learned that \nJensen was on an advisory committee, it would be “problem” for Jensen.  \nD.  Defendants Enact Political Retribution Against Spencer Evans \n \n145.  Evans’s decades-long FBI record has been objectively successful and without \nblemish.  Prior to January 2025, his career charted a course typical of his peers amongst the FBI’s \nsenior leadership. \n146.  He spent significant time in leadership positions at the Jacksonville and Oklahoma \nCity Field Offices and later at FBI Headquarters as a Deputy Assistant Director (“DAD”) of the \nHuman Resources Division (“HRD”).   \n147.  Evans’s time with HRD overlapped with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As \na result, beginning in 2021, one of his additional duties required him to act as the signatory on FBI \npersonnel’s reasonable accommodation requests for exemptions from COVID-19 protocol.  The \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 41 of 68\n \nFBI’s COVID-19 protocol was not set internally; it was incorporated from DOJ’s department-wide \nprotocol, which itself was devised directly from the directives of Executive Branch leadership that \nwere regularly recalibrated throughout the pandemic. \n148.  From approximately 2021-2022, Evans’s role as DAD at HRD required him to \nreview requests from the FBI workforce to be exempted from certain COVID-19 protocol like \nvaccination requirements and mask guidance. \n149.  Although he was often the final FBI signatory on these exemption requests, neither \nEvans nor HRD played the central role in how the FBI evaluated such requests.  Instead, all such \nrequests were processed through the FBI’s Office of Equal Employment Opportunity Affairs \n(“EEO”).  EEO, which has its own separate leadership structure and chain of command outside of \nHRD, treated COVID-19 exemption requests like any other accommodation requests.   \n150.  EEO’s analysis entailed assessing the circumstances of the request, speaking with \nthe  requesting  individual’s  local  leadership  to  determine  the  feasibility  of  the  requested \naccommodation, and ultimately making a recommendation for approval or denial by someone in \nthe requesting employee’s chain of command.  EEO recommendations for COVID protocol \ndeviations were subsequently subjected to an additional level of review by an attorney from the \nFBI’s Office of General Counsel (“OGC”), which made its own recommendation about the \naccommodation request.  Then, somebody from outside of the EEO signed off on a final decision \nbased  on  the  EEO  and  OGC  recommendations.    For  COVID-related  requests,  FBI  senior \nleadership determined this official would be a DAD or Assistant Director in the HRD. \n151.  To Evans’s knowledge, he approved every single request for an exemption to the \nvaccination requirement that EEO presented to him during his time as a signing authority.  Further, \nhe has no recollection of ever disagreeing with EEO’s recommendation to approve or disapprove \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 42 of 68\n \nan accommodation request.  In other words, far from displaying a “lack of reasonableness and \noverzealousness,” his role was essentially that of a mid-level manager who, to the best of his \nmemory, always implemented the recommendation generated from FBI EEO’s own independent \nreview.   \n152.  Evans eventually moved on from HRD and became the SAC of the FBI’s Las Vegas \nField Office in 2022.  Unbeknownst to him at the time, a former FBI Special Agent who had been \ninvoluntarily discharged had been regularly posting about Evans on his social media pages and \npodcast.   Shortly after January 2024, Evans learned that this ex-agent had been airing his \ngrievances on social media against Evans and other FBI leaders since at least 2022 and had \ndeveloped a close relationship with Patel. \n153.  Since the inauguration, this ex-agent has claimed that he had advised Patel prior to \nhis confirmation to fire Evans as soon as he was confirmed and that Patel had agreed.  For example, \nthe ex-agent posted a screenshot that purports to show a text message between himself and then-\nnominee  Patel  where  the  ex-agent  stated,  “THIS  guy  is  the  dude  in  charge  of  HR  who \nPERSONALLY denied my request to not take a Covid test every 2 days in order to keep my job. \nAnd removed me. Good morning.”  According to the posted communication, a contact named \n“Kash” replied, “He’s fucked.”8 \n154.  As explained above, the “SAC of Las Vegas” appeared on a list of individuals to \nbe terminated that Bove had shared with Kissane and Driscoll on January 28, 2025.  At the time, \nBove did not appear to know the name of the SAC of Las Vegas, only that whoever held that \nposition was on a list to be terminated for failing to be sufficiently loyal to the President’s agenda.   \n \n8 https://x.com/KyleSeraphin/status/1955645066040721776 [https://perma.cc/WG3V-5JL3] \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 43 of 68\n \n155.  Kissane called Evans on January 30, 2025 and advised that DOJ planned to \nterminate his FBI employment if he did not retire by the weekend.  Evans responded that he was \nineligible  to  retire  and  Kissane  subsequently  advised  Evans  the  FBI  would  place  him  on \nadministrative leave for an undefined period of time.  Shortly after that discussion, the Assistant \nDirector at HRD emailed Evans to confirm he was being placed on administrative leave and should \nnot carry out agent functions, but that the action was not punitive.  Being unsure of what the \nultimate  outcome  might  be,  Evans  emailed  the  Las  Vegas  office  to  inform  them  of  the \ndevelopments—namely, that he had received notification he was being fired and had been given \nno rationale for the decision, which had come as a shock—and to encourage them to stay focused \non the mission in the event of his termination. \n156.  DOJ  leadership  ultimately  decided  not  to  fire  him.    After  taking  a  week  of \nadministrative leave, FBI leadership directed Evans to return to work.   \n157.  Upon his return, Evans continued to fulfill the role of SAC Las Vegas and led the \noffice through, among other things, the successful investigation and ultimate arrest of an individual \nalleged to be responsible for firebombing at a Tesla business in March 2025.  Indeed, he is \nrecognized in DOJ’s own press release covering the arrest for his contributions to the case, \nalongside Bondi and Patel.9   \n158.  Evans remained concerned that DOJ or FBI leadership might attempt to fire him \nagain, based on false allegations of misconduct surrounding COVID protocols.  On multiple \noccasions in February and March 2025, Evans asked FBI Associate Deputy Director Will Rivers, \nFBI Operations Director Michael Glasheen, and other senior FBI officials to ensure that Patel and \n \n9 DOJ Press Release, March 27, 2025, “Nevada Resident Arrested and Charged in Connection with \nViolent Tesla Arson in Las Vegas,” https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nevada-resident-arrested-and-\ncharged-connection-violent-tesla-arson-las-vegas.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 44 of 68\n \nBongino were briefed on the history and facts of the FBI’s enforcement of COVID protocols.  \nRivers and Glasheen told Evans not to worry about the false allegations because Patel and Bongino \nhad been fully briefed on the background of the former FBI employees making the COVID \nallegations and, according to Rivers and Glasheen, knew they were not credible.   \n159.  Around this time, Evans virtually met Patel and Bongino through a series of video \nteleconference meet-and-greets they were conducting with various SACs.  During these meetings, \nPatel and Bongino did not bring up COVID-19 protocol or Evans’s role at HRD.  Instead, they \ngenerally congratulated Evans and others for doing good work and indicated that, as SACs, they \nshould be posting more about their successful investigations and other “FBI wins” on social media.  \n160.  Following Patel’s and Bongino’s guidance, in early April, Evans posted on the FBI \nLas Vegas official social media page a video announcing the arrest of a suspected MS-13 fugitive \naccused of committing multiple murders.  The official DOJ press release about the arrest includes \na quote from Evans.10  On or about April 11, 2025, Patel and Bongino reposted the video \nannouncement to their own social media pages, which meant that a video of Evans announcing the \narrest was now visible on their social media news feeds.  The video subsequently amassed over 2 \nmillion views.  Patel added a comment to his re-post of Evans’s video, saying “@FBILasVegas \nhas been a critical part of our work to locate more violent criminals, get them off the street, and \nmake America safer. Well done team.”11  Bongino’s re-post of the video appears to now be deleted. \n161.  After seeing Evans appear in the re-posts by FBI leadership, the ex-agent who had \nbeen fixated on Evans publicized Patel’s re-post and claimed, “[a]fter [Kash Patel] was nominated, \n \n10 DOJ Press Release, April 2, 2025, “High Ranking MS-13 Leader And Fugitive Wanted For \nMultiple Murders Found And Arrested In Long Island,” https://www.justice.gov/usao-nv/pr/high-\nranking-ms-13-leader-and-fugitive-wanted-multiple-murders-found-and-arrested-long.  \n \n11 https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1910681370008981712 [https://perma.cc/29VF-8WZR] \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 45 of 68\n \nhe asked me about people in the FBI who were problems.  I said Spencer Evans, the SAC of Las \nVegas, was the man who PERSONALLY denied the religious accommodations for Covid 19 shots \nand testing protocols.  Kash said ‘Gone.’”12  The ex-agent tagged Patel in this post. \n162.  Shortly after this, Evans received an email from the Assistant Director of the FBI’s \nPublic Affairs Office instructing him to immediately cease all postings to FBI Las Vegas social \nmedia sites and go on a “media blackout.”  He was further instructed to remove links to a local TV \nnews interview Evans had conducted about cyber scams earlier that week and which FBI Las \nVegas had posted to its social media platforms to increase public awareness about cyber-crime. \nThis seemed to contradict Patel’s and Bongino’s guidance just weeks prior to substantially increase \nthe quantity of social media postings by local FBI field offices. \n163.  Glasheen, who had headquarters-level supervisory authority over the Las Vegas \nField Office and served as Evans’s direct supervisor, privately reassured Evans on April 23, 2025 \nthat Patel thought he was doing excellent work but added that the publicization of his work was \ncreating “political pressure” for the Director. \n164.  On May 19, 2025, Glasheen phoned Evans to tell him that the Director was \nremoving him as SAC of Las Vegas.  Glasheen noted that the night prior, Bongino told him Evans \n“had to go,” and that Glasheen had confirmed this with Patel that morning.  Evans inquired if he \nwas being removed for performance or misconduct reasons and was told he was not.   \n165.  Evans was told he needed to vacate his SAC position by the end of the first week \nof June and that the FBI would ask him to waive the usual 30-day written notification of transfer \nfor SES members, which he eventually did.  In the interim, the FBI would place Evans on \nadministrative leave for several weeks until he reported to a new assignment.  Evans was told to \n \n12 https://x.com/KyleSeraphin/status/1910682452734992689 [https://perma.cc/L3VJ-8BLV] \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 46 of 68\n \npick an unfilled Section Chief or Deputy Assistant Director position.  However, when he inquired \nabout an unfilled Section Chief-level position in Australia, he was told by Rivers his reassignment \ncould not appear to be a reward or to a position viewed as highly coveted.  Evans ultimately was \nassigned to a Deputy Assistant Director position in Huntsville, Alabama and was placed on nine \nweeks of administrative leave to cover the period between his removal from Las Vegas and his \nanticipated report date to Huntsville.  Yet again, he was not fired. \n166.  On August 6, 2025, while Evans was packing his truck to leave for his new \nassignment in Huntsville, Rivers called again.  This time, he said Evans was being fired.  Evans \nasked whether he was being fired for discipline, performance, or misconduct.  Rivers said no. \n167.  In the lead up to August 6, 2025, Evans had spoken with his professional colleagues \nand friends in the Las Vegas law enforcement community, some of whom knew Patel during his \ntime living in Nevada.  One of these individuals—who was close enough to Patel to have served \nas a background reference for him—discussed Evans’s situation with Patel at some point between \nMay and August.  In this conversation, later relayed to Evans, Patel had confided to this law \nenforcement professional that the personnel actions directed at Evans were “all DOJ,” and \n“politically driven,” and that the matter was out of Patel’s hands.   \nE.

As explained above, CIRG is critical to the country’s ability \nto respond to fast-moving threats across the globe.  CIRG also includes the FBI’s aviation units. \n169.  On or around August 1, 2025, FBI Supervisory Special Agent Chris Meyer became \nthe subject of intense social media activity.  Specifically, various social media posts claimed \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 47 of 68\n \nincorrectly that Meyer had been the signatory to the Mar-a-Lago search warrant affidavit and was \nnow Patel’s personal pilot.   \n170.  In fact, Meyer was not the signatory to the Mar-a-Lago search warrant affidavit.  \nHe was not the case agent for the investigation concerning President Trump’s handling of \nclassified documents, nor did he participate in the search of Mar-a-Lago. \n171.  On Friday, August 1, 2025, FBI Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Jake Hemme \ncalled Driscoll to say that “social media” was reporting that a pilot for Patel had been involved in \nthe Mar-a-Lago search.  Hemme asked Driscoll to confirm if this was true and to ask his \nsubordinate units, which included all relevant FBI aviation units.   \n172.  Driscoll explained that the act of inquiring whether any of the people he supervised \nhad been involved in the Mar-a-Lago search would cause significant disruption, since it would \nstrongly  imply  that  they  would  face  discipline  or  termination  for  this  case  assignment.  \nNevertheless, at Driscoll’s direction, FBI Deputy Assistant Director Steven Palmer pulled all of \nthe agents’ personnel details from the FBI’s HRD, which included the general dates of service for \nemployees within the CIRG as well as previous office assignments for these employees.  There \nwere only four licensed G550 Gulfstream pilots, including Meyer. \n173.  On Saturday, August 2, 2025, the FBI’s Associate Deputy Director and Chief \nOperating Officer Will Rivers called Driscoll to ask him for details about Meyer. Meyer is a \nmilitary veteran and a qualified pilot.  As part of his duties with the FBI, he flew the FBI’s private \njet, a Gulfstream G550, which means he served as the FBI Director’s pilot while on duty.  Along \nwith those duties, Meyer—and all of the G550 pilots—also flew HRT personnel to overseas \nmissions and other mission-critical assignments.  HRT is also responsible for flying “Foreign \nTransfer of Custody” missions, which detains and transports terrorists and criminals from overseas \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 48 of 68\n \nto the United States to face criminal prosecution.  In short, each pilot in CIRG plays an essential \nrole in critical FBI missions. \n174.  Rivers wanted to know Meyer’s current location and whether he was flying the \nDirector on his current trip.  He also asked Driscoll about Meyer’s tenure with the FBI, which was \napproximately 13 years.  Rivers told Driscoll that Meyer was no longer permitted to fly the \nDirector’s plane.   \n175.  Driscoll responded that he would comply with that directive but that he would not \ncompletely halt Meyer’s work as a pilot and that Meyer would still fly all his other missions and \ntraining profiles.  Moreover, Driscoll also informed Rivers that Meyer was on annual leave with \nhis family during the coming week, until approximately August 8, 2025.  Driscoll also pointed out \nthat prohibiting Meyer from flying Patel would create a significant reduction in pilots and have \nserious negative impacts on the FBI’s ability to support the Director’s travel, as well as the ability \nto accomplish the FBI’s critical domestic and overseas missions. \n176.  Later that same day, Driscoll received another call from Rivers. Rivers said that he \nhad gotten a call from Bongino who advised that he and Patel were under a lot of pressure from \nthe White House regarding Meyer.  Rivers reported that Bongino said that he and Patel did not \nwant Meyer to return to work after his annual leave, since they would face negative consequences \nif he did.    \n177.  Driscoll asked for clarification as to whether that meant someone in the White \nHouse, through the FBI Director or Deputy Director, intended to fire Meyer.  Rivers indicated that \nhe believed this to be true.  \n178.  Driscoll replied that firing Meyer was wrong, illegal, and not for cause, to which \nRivers replied that he knew that.  Rivers said he was addressing the legal implications with Patel \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 49 of 68\n \nand Bongino.  Moreover, as a military veteran, Meyer was entitled to special protection from the \nMerit System Protection Board.  Driscoll asked Rivers if Meyer’s termination was imminent, to \nwhich Rivers responded that he had been told that Meyer would be fired by Friday, August 8, \n2025. \n179.  At this point, Driscoll demanded an opportunity to speak with Patel in person, to \nwhich Rivers agreed.  Driscoll scheduled a meeting with Patel for Tuesday, August 5, 2025. \n180.  Driscoll later spoke with Meyer over the phone and informed him that he would no \nlonger be allowed to pilot Patel’s aircraft.  Driscoll also told Meyer that he would be raising the \nissue with the Director and would challenge the decision. \n181.  On Monday, August 4, 2024, Driscoll received a call from Bongino.  Bongino asked \nDriscoll if anybody would be able to “find anything” in his emails from the time he (Driscoll) was \nserving as Acting Director.  Driscoll replied that there would be nothing incriminating to find in \nhis emails during this time and took Bongino’s question to mean that somebody besides Bongino \nand Patel would be searching through his old emails in an attempt to find a basis for firing him.  \nBongino said that he would attempt to keep Driscoll in place.  \n182.  On Tuesday, August 5, 2025, at 9:00 a.m., Driscoll again met with Rivers.  This \nmeeting included a status update on Meyer. \n183.  At 10:00 a.m. on August 5, 2025, Driscoll met directly with Patel to discuss Meyer.  \nSpecifically, Driscoll stated that summarily firing Meyer would be illegal based on his military \nveteran status and would also violate all established FBI policies for adverse actions against \npersonnel.    \n184.  Patel responded that Meyer would be fired by Friday, August 8, 2025, and that there \nwas nothing either Patel or Driscoll could say or do that would stop it.  Driscoll pointed out that \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 50 of 68\n \nMeyer had not committed any misconduct and that being assigned to cases could not be grounds \nfor termination.  Patel said he understood this, but that as Driscoll should know from “sitting in \nthis seat,” meaning serving as the Director, that “you can’t save everyone.”   \n185.  When Driscoll explained it, Patel acknowledged that the FBI would be sued and \nwould lose in court.  He also acknowledged that he would likely be deposed concerning his \nknowledge of the reasons for Meyer’s termination.  He also acknowledged that the FBI workforce \nwould likely respond negatively to Meyer’s termination.  \n186.  Patel stated that all FBI employees who they identified who had worked on the \ncases against President Trump would be removed from their jobs, regardless of their retirement \neligibility status.  He then stated that Driscoll needed to understand that “the FBI tried to put the \nPresident in jail and he hasn’t forgotten it.”  Patel then stated that his own job depended on the \nremoval of the agents who worked on the cases against the President, regardless of whether the \nagents chose to work on those cases or not.  Patel acknowledged that this would be in direct \nviolation of internal FBI processes meant to adjudicate adverse actions and prevent retaliation \nbased on case assignments.  He again commented that he knew the nature of the summary firings \nwere likely illegal and that he could be sued and later deposed. \n187.  One of the online personalities who had first raised Meyer’s identity on social \nmedia later claimed in an interview to have provided the information directly to a “Trump \nadministration insider” who was “in the president’s orbit.”13 \n \n13 Daniel Klaidman, CBS News, August 20, 2025, Politics may have spurred August purse of 5 \nveteran FBI agents, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/politics-may-have-spurred-august-purge-of-\n5-veteran-fbi-agents/.   \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 51 of 68\n \nF.  The Firing of Brian J. Driscoll, Jr. \n188.  On August 8, 2025, a subordinate within CIRG received a one-page letter addressed \nfrom Patel to Driscoll (the “Driscoll Termination Letter”) in his email inbox with instructions to \nprint it and hand-deliver it to Driscoll.  The letter was written on letterhead for the United States \nDepartment of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, “Office of the Director.” \n189.  The Driscoll Termination Letter reads as follows: \nThis document provides official notice that you are being summarily dismissed from \nyour position at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and removed from the federal \nservice, under my authority as FBI Director, effective immediately. \n \nYou have failed to execute and perform requested tasks and issued communications to \nthe FBI workforce that undermined the leadership of the Department of Justice. These \ncommunications advocated for insubordination within the Bureau and weakened \nworkforce morale. In addition, you failed to timely respond to unapproved disclosure \nto the media of law enforcement sensitive information.  \n \nPursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution and the laws of the United \nStates,  your  employment  with  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  is  hereby \nterminated. \n \nIf applicable, you may have a right to file an appeal of this removal with the U.S. Merit \nSystems Protection Board (MSPB) within 30 days of the effective date of the removal \naction. For more information on how to file an appeal with the MSPB, please visit \nwww.mspb.gov.  \n \n190.  The Driscoll Termination Letter was signed by Patel and dated August 8, 2025.   \n191.  At the time of his firing, Driscoll had amassed 20 years’ worth of federal service \nbut had not yet reached the age of 50 and thus could not retire.  He was summarily fired and, \naccording to the letter, “removed from the federal service.”   \n192.  As of the date of this filing, Driscoll has not been provided with an SF-50.  The SF-\n50 is a government form titled “Notification of Personnel Action” which is provided to former \nemployees upon termination.  The “Nature of Action” on an SF-50 would typically signify the \nremoval of an employee and is completed by the employer.  That section has a corresponding \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 52 of 68\n \nsection, “Legal Authority” which is also intended to be completed by the employer.  As of the date \nof this filing, individuals within FBI’s HRD are reportedly unsure what to enter under “Legal \nAuthority” and have thus not yet completed the form or issued it to Driscoll. \n193.  After receiving the letter, Driscoll turned in his badge and firearm, completed \nvarious administrative paperwork, and left the FBI.  \nG.  The Firing of Steven J. Jensen \n194.  Throughout the week of August 4, Bongino still publicly supported Jensen.  On \nAugust 6, 2025, just two days before Jensen’s unlawful firing, Bongino reposted a public statement \nby Jensen and the WFO on his official FBI account, extolling the FBI’s arrest of an active duty \nmilitary servicemember charged with espionage and export violations on behalf of the Russian \ngovernment.  A screenshot of that post is below: \n \n195.  This post has since been deleted from Bongino’s social media feed.   \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 53 of 68\n \n196.  That same day, Rivers contacted Jensen.  Rivers told Jensen that “trouble was \ncoming” his way.  Rivers said that it was “really bad,” that people would lose their jobs that Friday, \nand that Jensen was among that group.  Rivers attempted to convince Jensen to resign before \nFriday.  Jensen refused.   \n197.  On Thursday, having been told that he would be fired the next day, Jensen held a \nvirtual town hall with WFO.  He attempted to answer questions and bolster morale by emphasizing \nthe strong leaders that remain in place.  He spent the rest of the day attempting to make transition \npreparations.   \n198.  On August 8, 2025, one of Jensen’s subordinate SACs received a letter via email \nwith instructions to print it and hand it to Jensen.  The one-page letter was addressed from Patel to \nJensen (the “Jensen Termination Letter”).  It was written on letterhead for the United States \nDepartment of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, “Office of the Director.” \n199.  The Jensen Termination Letter reads as follows: \nThis document provides official notice that you are being summarily dismissed from \nyour position at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and removed from the federal \nservice, under my authority as FBI Director, effective immediately. \n \nYou failed to execute and perform requested tasks, resulting in an unreasonable delay \nin the execution of FBI priorities.  \n \nPursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution and the laws of the United \nStates,  your  employment  with  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  is  hereby \nterminated. \n \nIf applicable, you may have a right to file an appeal of this removal with the U.S. Merit \nSystems Protection Board (MSPB) within 30 days of the effective date of the removal \naction. For more information on how to file an appeal with the MSPB, please visit \nwww.mspb.gov.  \n \n200.  The Jensen Termination Letter was signed by Patel and dated August 8, 2025.  \nNeither Patel nor Bongino ever interacted directly with Jensen to discuss his firing.  Jensen met \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 54 of 68\n \nwith his Chief Security Office so that he could be “read out” of various security clearance programs \nand left his office. \n201.  At the time of his firing, Jensen had amassed almost 20 years’ worth of federal \nservice and might soon have reached eligibility to retire.  Instead, he was summarily fired and, \naccording to the letter, “removed from the federal service.”   \n202.  As of the date of this filing, Jensen has not been provided with an SF-50.  The SF-\n50 is a government form titled “Notification of Personnel Action” which is provided to former \nemployees upon termination.  The “Nature of Action” on an SF-50 would typically signify the \nremoval of an employee and is completed by the employer.  That section has a corresponding \nsection, “Legal Authority” which is also intended to be completed by the employer.  As of the date \nof this filing, individuals within FBI’s HRD are reportedly unsure what to enter under “Legal \nAuthority” and have thus not yet completed the form or issued it to Jensen.    \nH.  The Firing of Spencer L. Evans \n203.  On August 6, 2025, Rivers called Evans and informed him that he was being fired.  \nDuring their brief discussion, Evans asked whether he was being fired for discipline, performance, \nor misconduct.  Rivers said no. \n204.  On August 8, 2025, Evans received a call from one of his subordinates, an ASAC \nof the Las Vegas Field Office.  The ASAC had received a letter addressed from Patel to Evans (the \n“Evans Termination Letter”) in his email with instructions to print the letter out and hand-deliver \nit to Evans.    \n205.  The letter was written on letterhead for the United States Department of Justice, \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, “Office of the Director.”  The Evans Termination Letter reads as \nfollows: \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 55 of 68\n \nThis document provides official notice that you are being summarily dismissed \nfrom your position at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and removed from the \nfederal service, under my authority as FBI Director, effective immediately. \n \nYou  demonstrated  a  lack  of  reasonableness  and  overzealousness  in  the \nimplementation of COVID-19 protocols and policies. \n  \nPursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution and the laws of the United \nStates,  your  employment  with  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  is  hereby \nterminated. \n \nIf applicable, you may have a right to file an appeal of this removal with the U.S. \nMerit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) within 30 days of the effective date of the \nremoval action. For more information on how to file an appeal with the MSPB, \nplease visit www.mspb.gov.  \n \n206.  The Evans Termination Letter was signed by Patel and dated August 8, 2025.   \n207.  At the time of his firing, Evans had amassed 20 years’ worth of federal service but \nhad not yet reached the age of 50 and thus could not retire.  However, he would have been eligible \nfor early retirement.  This was never offered to him.  Instead, he was summarily fired and, \naccording to the letter, “removed from the federal service.”   \n208.  As of the date of this filing, Evans has not been provided with an SF-50.  The SF-\n50 is a government form titled “Notification of Personnel Action” which is provided to former \nemployees upon termination.  The “Nature of Action” on an SF-50 would typically signify the \nremoval of an employee and is completed by the employer.  That section has a corresponding \nsection, “Legal Authority” which is also intended to be completed by the employer.  As of the date \nof this filing, individuals within FBI’s HRD are reportedly unsure what to enter under “Legal \nAuthority” and have thus not yet completed the form or issued it to Evans. \nI.   Patel’s Post-Termination Statements \n209.  As detailed above, on August 8, 2025, Patel fired Driscoll, Jensen, and Evans by \nsending letters to their subordinates.  Patel also fired Giardina and Meyer that same day, also \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 56 of 68\n \nthrough letter correspondence.   \n210.  The firings were covered extensively in the news media.  Less than two weeks after \nthe firings, on August 20, 2025, Patel sat for an interview with Larry Kudlow of Fox Business.  \nThe interview remains available on Fox Business’s website.14     \n211.  Throughout the interview, Patel made several references to the Mar-a-Lago search \nwarrant execution being the result of “weaponization and politicalization by the FBI and the DOJ.”  \nHe claimed that his actions as FBI Director were “ridding this place of its former leadership \nstructure that did that weaponization.” \n212.  In an exchange with Kudlow about whether “old leaders” who worked prior \ncriminal investigations into President Trump had been dismissed, Patel stated the following: \nEvery single person that has been found to have weaponized or participated in that \nprocess, has been removed from leadership positions, and if and when we find any \nothers that are involved in this, as you know this is a 37,000-person agency, we are \ngoing to take swift action just like we have.  \n \n  (Emphases added).15 \n \n213.  The only publicly known firings within the FBI that occurred between August 8, \n2025 and August 20, 2025, were the unlawful terminations of Driscoll, Jensen, Evans, Giardina, \nand Meyer. \nV.  RELEVANT  PROTECTIONS  FOR  THE  FBI’S  SENIOR  EXECUTIVE \nSERVICE \n \n214.  The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (“CSRA”) is the primary framework through \nwhich most federal employees can seek review of personnel action taken against them.  This \nincludes members of the SES, which was designed to be a senior corps of civil service executives, \nselected for their leadership qualifications, who serve as the link between political appointees and \n \n14 Fox Business, available at https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6377153656112.  \n15 Id. beginning at approximately 8:30. \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 57 of 68\n \nthe rest of the federal workforce.  5 U.S.C. § 3131 et seq.    \n215.  But the CSRA expressly excludes FBI employees from most of its provisions, \nincluding the right to appeal removals or other adverse actions to the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard (“MSPB”), except where the employee is a preference-eligible veteran.  5 U.S.C. § \n7511(b)(8).   \n216.  To address the gap for FBI senior leadership, Congress enacted a separate scheme, \ncodified at 5 U.S.C. § 3151, authorizing the Attorney General to create a Senior Executive Service \nspecific to the FBI.  Importantly, Congress required that the regulations establishing the FBI SES \n“shall provide for removal or suspension consistent with subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section \n7543.”  5 U.S.C. § 3151(a)(5)(D). \n217.  Section 7543, in turn, sets out a “for cause” standard: a senior executive may be \nremoved only for “misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a directed \nreassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function.”  5 U.S.C. § 7543(a).  The statute \nalso mandates procedural protections, including written notice of at least 30 days (subject to a \nshortened seven-day period if there is reasonable cause to believe the executive has committed a \ncrime), the right to respond orally and in writing and to “furnish affidavits and other evidence in \nsupport of the answer” after being provided at least seven days to prepare the same, the right to \nrepresentation by an attorney or other representative, and a written decision with the specific \nreasons for the final action.  5 U.S.C. § 7543(b). \n218.  Read together, § 3151 and § 7543 ensure that FBI SES members are not “at will” \nemployees.  They may not be terminated at the discretion of agency leadership but only for cause, \nand  then  only  in  accordance  with  statutory  procedures.  Courts  have  recognized  that  these \nprovisions create a protected property interest in continued SES employment at the FBI, meaning \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 58 of 68\n \nthat  senior  executives  are  entitled  to  constitutional  due  process  protections  if  removal  or \nsuspension is sought.   \n219.  In relevant part, the FBI SES Policy states an intent to “protect senior executives \nfrom arbitrary or capricious actions” and “provide for an executive system which is guided by the \npublic interest and free from improper political interference.”   \n220.  Under the FBI SES Policy, different categories of SES members exist.  A “key \nexecutive” is a term used for individuals who occupy “the positions of Executive Assistant \nDirector, Assistant Director, Assistant Director in Charge, or General Counsel,” and “positions \nwhich report to the Director.”  As the Assistant Director of CIRG, Driscoll was a key executive.  \nAs Assistant Director in Charge of WFO, Jensen was also a key executive. \n221.  All three Plaintiffs had completed their SES probationary periods prior to their \nsummary terminations.  If non-probationary SES are removed from their positions for executive \nperformance issues, they are “guaranteed placement in a GS 15 position.”  “GS 15” refers to a \nspecific pay grade for federal employees.   \n222.  In the context of adverse actions like disciplinary removals and suspensions, FBI \nSES Policy dutifully echoes 5 U.S.C. § 7543(a), providing that an “[a]ction may be taken against \na member of the SES for misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a directed \nreassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function.” \n223.  The FBI SES policy entitles non-probationary FBI SES members to certain rights \nin the event of such an action.  For example, when faced with adverse action, they are entitled to \nreceive: \na.  “At least 30 days advance written notice stating specific reasons for proposed \nactions,” subject to the same crime exception found in § 7543; \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 59 of 68\n \nb.  “A reasonable time, but not less than seven days, to answer orally and in writing \nand to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer”; \nc.  Representation by an attorney or other representative;  \nd.  “A written decision of the final action and specific reasons therefor at the earliest \npracticable date.”  \n224.  The policy also provides that FBI SES will receive a notice of any proposed adverse \naction that informs them of their right to “review the material that is relied on to support the reasons \nfor the action(s).”   \n225.  Importantly,  the  FBI  SES  Policy  delineates  different  approval  authorities  for \nadverse actions against SES members.  It states that “[t]he Director has final approval authority \nregarding removals and adverse actions for the majority of SES employees, excepting only those \nwho are key executives for which final approval authority resides with the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.”  (Emphasis added.)  \nVI.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT \n(SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n226.  The Paragraphs above are incorporated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n227.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution \nguarantees that “no person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law.”  Plaintiffs each have property and liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clause.   \n228.  As members of the FBI’s SES, Plaintiffs have property interests in their continued \nemployment with the FBI, including, but not limited to, their salary, health insurance, retirement \nbenefits,  and  other  benefits.    Defendants  deprived  Plaintiffs  of  their  property  interests  by \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 60 of 68\n \nterminating Plaintiffs’ respective employment with the FBI without due process of law and in \nviolation of binding statutory and Fifth Amendment protections. \n229.  The Fifth Amendment’s protection against deprivation of liberty without due \nprocess of law also protects against reputational harm caused by government officials when that \nharm is accompanied by other harm.  Here, in the course of unlawfully terminating Plaintiffs’ \nrespective employment  without due process of law, Defendants—primarily through Patel—\npublicly connected the termination actions to allegations that Plaintiffs had been “weaponizing” \nthe FBI.  This false and defamatory public smear impugned the professional reputation of each \nPlaintiff, suggesting they were something other than faithful and apolitical law enforcement \nofficials, and has caused not only the loss of Plaintiffs’ present government employment but further \nharmed their future employment prospects. \n230.  As members of the FBI SES, Plaintiffs were each entitled by statutes, policy, and \nthe Fifth Amendment to protections against deprivation of their property and liberty interests \nwithout the process required by law.  The lack of any due process accorded to Plaintiffs deprived \neach of them of the ability to challenge the accuracy of any evidence that allegedly serves as the \nbasis for their removal, if any, as well as to protect each of their reputations. \n231.  Defendants’ actions have prevented each Plaintiff from participating in his chosen \nprofession or line of work.  The circumstances of Plaintiffs’ firings also cast an unconstitutional \npall over their future professional opportunities.  By falsely signaling that Plaintiffs lacked integrity \nin the performance of their duties, Defendants intended to and did adversely impact Plaintiffs’ \nreputations and employment opportunities without affording them the process to which they are \nentitled.  Plaintiffs’ termination letters purported to bar them from all future “federal service,” \neffectively communicating to any future employer that Plaintiffs’ alleged misconduct had rendered \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 61 of 68\n \nthem unsuitable for any position within the federal government.   \n232.  As a result, Defendants have effectively stigmatized Plaintiffs’ reputations and \nimparted a “status change” upon them that has implicated their liberty interests.   \n233.  As Plaintiffs were never provided any to respond to the termination and removal \nactions taken by Defendants, Plaintiffs are entitled to, among other remedies, a name-clearing \nhearing regarding the false public statements regarding their actions and the basis for their \nrespective removals. \n234.  Plaintiffs have each suffered adverse and harmful effects, including, but not limited \nto, lost or jeopardized present or future financial opportunities.  Defendants’ actions to terminate \nPlaintiffs without due process unlawfully deprived them of their property and liberty interests. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \n(RETALIATION FOR PERCIEVED POLITICAL AFFILIATION) \n(Against All Defendants) \n235.  Paragraphs 1-225 are incorporated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n236.  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees all citizens “the freedom \nof  speech”  to  include  expression  and  association.    It  forbids  government  officials  to  fire \ngovernment employees simply for not being supportive of a political ideology, party, or agenda.  \nThese protections apply even when the government incorrectly perceives a citizen’s political \naffiliation. \n237.  Defendants’  actions,  as  set  forth  above,  constitute  improper  acts  of  political \nretribution, in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs’ \nterminations were unlawful, in part, because they were based on an incorrect perception that \nPlaintiffs’ involvement in legitimate law enforcement activities was born of political motives and \nconstituted acts of political disloyalty to President Trump.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 62 of 68\n \n238.  As set forth above, Plaintiffs had tactical, operational, and supervisory duties within \nthe FBI.  Those duties and their oath to the Constitution required them to participate in a variety \nof law enforcement investigations, including those concerning (1) the January 6, 2021 attack on \nthe United States Capitol; (2) President Trump’s alleged retention of classified documents; and (3) \nforeign interference in American elections.   \n239.  Plaintiffs’ duties and their oath to the Constitution also required them to participate \nin administrative activities within the FBI, including, but not limited to, complying with statutes, \nregulations, and policies governing the FBI, including those policies enacted during the COVID-\n19  pandemic,  and  maintaining  the  integrity  of  ongoing  FBI  investigations  and  operations.  \nPlaintiffs fulfilled these duties with professionalism, competence, integrity, and free from political \nconsiderations of any kind. \n240.  As  set  forth  above,  Defendants  terminated  Plaintiffs  because  of  Defendants’ \nperception that their apolitical performance of their duties, as described herein, ran afoul of the \npolitical and personal loyalty that Defendants required.   \n241.  Partisan  affiliation  and  political  support  for  the  Defendants  are  not  legal  or \nappropriate requirements for the effective performance of Plaintiffs’ respective roles within the \nFBI. \n242.  Defendants’ unconstitutional actions harmed Plaintiffs by infringing upon the \nexercise of their constitutional rights, damaging their reputations, depriving them of their rightful \nstatus as FBI employees in good standing, eliminating their primary source of income, depriving \nthem of health insurance, and reducing their retirement benefits. \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 63 of 68\n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nLEGAL NULLITY \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n243.  Paragraphs 1-225 are incorporated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n244.  Defendant Patel’s termination of Plaintiffs Driscoll and Jensen was not a valid \ntermination action.   \n245.  As described above,  Defendants afforded Plaintiffs none of the required due \nprocess statutorily mandated in the event of an adverse action brought against a member of the \nFBI SES, according to the FBI SES Policy promulgated pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 3151 and the \nmandatory removal protections required by 5 U.S.C. § 7543(a)-(c).  This alone makes the actions \nvoid and null.   \n246.  Patel’s letters to each Plaintiff were issued “under [Patel’s] authority as the FBI \nDirector.”  The letters were published on FBI letterhead belonging to the “Office of the Director.”  \nThe letters notify Plaintiffs that they are being “summarily dismissed.”   \n247.  In fact, for both Driscoll and Jensen, as an Assistant Director and an Assistant \nDirector in Charge, they were considered “key executives” as that term is defined in the FBI SES \nPolicy.  As that policy clearly states, “The Director has final approval authority regarding removals \nand adverse actions for the majority of SES employees, excepting only those who are key \nexecutives  for  which  final  approval  authority  resides  with  the  Deputy  Attorney  General.”  \nTherefore, only the Deputy Attorney General had authority to dismiss Driscoll and Jensen, per FBI \nprocedure, and only with due process.  As Patel does not serve as the Deputy Attorney General, \nhe never had authority to remove Driscoll and Jensen from their employment with the FBI. \n248.  Patel also stated in the termination letters that he is dismissing Plaintiffs “[p]ursuant \nto Article II of the Constitution and the laws of the United States.”  Here, too, he lacks authority \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 64 of 68\n \nand the action is a nullity.  Article II of the Constitution and the laws of the United States do not \nvest any such authority with the Director of the FBI.  Article II provides authority for the President, \nand the President alone, to appoint principal officers, concomitant with the power to remove them \n“at will.”  None of Plaintiffs are principal officers and, more importantly, the FBI Director is not \nthe President.  Rather, under Article II, Congress has the power to regulate the appointment and \nremoval of inferior officers and federal employees.  Here, they have done so through Federal law.  \nPlaintiffs are not “at will” employees and as explained herein, Congress expressly provided for \ntheir removals to be accompanied by due process. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nULTRA VIRES ACTION IN VIOLATION  \nOF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY \n(Against Defendants Patel and FBI) \n \n249.  Paragraphs 1-225 are incorporated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n250.  Patel purported to terminate each of the Plaintiffs pursuant to his asserted “authority \nas the FBI Director” and under “Article II of the United States Constitution and the laws of the \nUnited States.”  The letters of termination were signed by Defendant Patel on letterhead sent from \nthe “Office of the Director.”   \n251.  As described above, pursuant to federal law and operative FBI policy, Patel had no \nauthority to terminate Driscoll and Jensen from federal service because they were considered “key \nexecutives” of the FBI’s SES.  Federal law and operative FBI policy exclusively reserve authority \nfor such terminations to the Deputy Attorney General.  Further, Patel had no authority to summarily \nfire any of the Plaintiffs without affording them due process pursuant to FBI SES policy and its \ncorresponding statutory authority.   \n252.  Patel  also  lacks  any  ability  to  invoke  “Article  II”  as  a  basis  for  summary \ntermination.  Article II provides absolutely no removal authority to the Director of the FBI.  \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 65 of 68\n \nDefendants’  reliance  on  Article  II  of  the  United  States  Constitution  to  support  Plaintiffs’ \nterminations is invalid.  Such purported authority violates Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. \nConstitution, which grants Congress the power “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and \nproper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this \nConstitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof,”  \nand Article II, Section 2, which states that “Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads \nof Departments.”  Defendants’ removal of Plaintiffs under a purported Article II authority violates \nauthorities vested in Congress by Article I of the Constitution, which includes the powers to place \nlimitations on the removals of inferior Officers and federal employees like members of the FBI \nSES.  \n253.  Defendants had no lawful authority to terminate Plaintiffs from federal service \nwithout  adhering  to  the  statutory  and  constitutional  protections  afforded  to  each.    Their \nterminations were therefore ultra vires and without legal force or effect. \n254.  Plaintiffs have each suffered adverse and harmful effects, including, but not limited \nto, lost or jeopardized present or future financial opportunities. As such, they are each entitled to \nreinstatement, an award of backpay, and any other available damages. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT – 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n255.  Paragraphs 1-225 are incorporated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n256.  Plaintiffs are each entitled to declaratory relief on the basis of all claims identified. \nThere  is  a  substantial  and  ongoing  controversy  between  Plaintiffs  and  Defendants,  and  a \ndeclaration of rights under the Declaratory Judgment Act is both necessary and appropriate to \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 66 of 68\n \nestablish that the Defendants do not have authority to remove Plaintiffs without affording each of \nthem all rights and protections set forth by applicable statutes and regulations, the United States \nConstitution, and the First and Fifth Amendments thereto. \n257.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to declaratory relief to establish that their terminations \nwere a legal nullity. \n258.  Plaintiffs have each suffered adverse and harmful effects, including, but not limited \nto, lost or jeopardized present or future financial opportunities \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nWRIT OF MANDAMUS \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n259.  Paragraphs 1-225 are incorporated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n260.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs are entitled to a writ of mandamus commanding \nDefendants to return them to their respective offices and not remove them from federal service \nwithout following lawful procedures.  Defendants have a legal duty not to terminate Plaintiffs \nunless and until Plaintiffs have been afforded the protections prescribed by law and, absent this \nCourt granting relief, there is no other adequate means of redress. \n261.  The provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1361 create jurisdiction in cases seeking a writ of \nmandamus against federal officers, employees, and agencies, and they provide for an independent \ncause of action in the absence of any other available remedies.  To the extent relief is unavailable \nunder the Constitution, common law equity, or any other law to enjoin unlawful government \naction, mandamus lies here.  \nVII.  JURY DEMAND \n262.  Plaintiffs demand a jury trial on all triable issues. \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03109     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 67 of 68\n \nVIII.  REQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Brian J. Driscoll, Jr., Steven J. Jensen, and Spencer L. Evans \nrequest that the Court award them the following relief: \n  (1) A declaration that Defendants’ Terminations of Plaintiffs was a legal nullity;  \n  (2) A declaration that  Defendants’ actions violated Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment due \nprocess rights and order appropriate relief, to include, but not limited to, a name-clearing hearing; \n  (3) A declaration that Defendants’ actions violated Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and \norder appropriate relief; \n  (4)  An  order  requiring  Defendants  to  immediately  reinstate  Plaintiffs  and  enjoin \nDefendants from taking any further adverse personnel action against each of them without \nproviding appropriate procedural and substantive due process as required by law and the Fifth \nAmendment; \n  (5) An award of backpay and other monetary and administrative relief as appropriate; \n  (6) An award of the costs of this action and reasonable attorney fees under the Equal Access \nto Justice Act or any other applicable law; and \n  (7) Grant such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \nDate:  September 10, 2025      Respectfully Submitted, \n \n/s/ Margaret M.
