    "summary": "<p>In <em>National Alliance to End Homelessness &amp; Women&rsquo;s Development Corporation v. Turner</em>, the case tests whether HUD may attach sweeping political and ideological conditions to federal homelessness funding.</p>\r\n<p>On September 11, 2025, the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) and the Women&rsquo;s Development Corporation (WDC) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island before District Judge Mary S. McElroy and Magistrate Judge Austin E. McConaghy, naming Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner and the Department of Housing and Urban Development as defendants. Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Homelessness Law Center, the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island, and the Lawyers&rsquo; Committee for Rhode Island, with cooperating local counsel at DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry &amp; Revens, Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>The suit challenges HUD&rsquo;s September 5, 2025 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO, FR-6902-N-25A), which abruptly altered eligibility for $75 million in Continuum of Care permanent supportive housing funds, due to expire September 30, 2025. The new NOFO conditioned eligibility on jurisdictional mandates (e.g., enforcement of anti-camping laws, cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, and SORNA compliance) and applicant attestations (e.g., rejecting safe-consumption sites and affirming that &ldquo;sex is binary and immutable&rdquo;), with funding awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint asserts ten counts:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Count I &ndash; APA (5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2)(C)): agency action exceeding statutory authority.</li>\r\n<li>Count II &ndash; APA (&sect; 706(2)(A)): arbitrary and capricious action.</li>\r\n<li>Count III &ndash; APA (&sect; 706(2)(B)): contrary to constitutional right (all new criteria).</li>\r\n<li>Count IV &ndash; APA (&sect; 706(2)(D)): without observance of procedure required by law (all new criteria).</li>\r\n<li>Count V &ndash; Separation of Powers: violation of Articles I&ndash;II of the Constitution (all new criteria).</li>\r\n<li>Count VI &ndash; Spending Clause: violation of Article I, &sect; 8, cl. 1 (all new criteria).</li>\r\n<li>Count VII &ndash; Tenth Amendment: unconstitutional commandeering (jurisdictional criteria).</li>\r\n<li>Count VIII &ndash; APA (&sect; 706(2)(A)): contrary to law, specifically the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. &sect; 3601 et seq.), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000e et seq.), and HUD&rsquo;s Equal Access Rule (24 C.F.R. &sect; 5.106) (sex-binary criterion).</li>\r\n<li>Count IX &ndash; First Amendment (Free Speech Clause): compelled ideological speech (sex-binary criterion).</li>\r\n<li>Count X &ndash; Ultra Vires: agency action wholly beyond authority (all new criteria).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Alongside the complaint, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). They asked the court to (1) enjoin HUD and Secretary Turner from obligating or disbursing any of the $75 million under the Sept. 5 NOFO, (2) suspend the statutory lapse of funds past September 30, (3) order HUD to maintain the funds pending further order, and (4) require HUD to report compliance within three business days.</p>\r\n<p>The relief sought includes declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to vacate the new criteria and preserve the funds, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. Plaintiffs do not seek damages. The suit is not a class action and has not been consolidated with other litigation.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

They sued HUD and HUD Secretary Scott Turner, arguing that HUD’s September 5, 2025 notice unfairly tied $75 million in housing funds—set to expire September 30—to political requirements. These included forcing cities to crack down on camping and work with immigration authorities, and forcing applicants to promise not to run safe drug-use sites and to say “sex is binary.”\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit makes ten claims: that HUD went beyond its legal authority, acted unfairly, violated the Constitution, failed to follow required procedures, crossed into powers reserved for Congress, misused federal funding rules, forced states to act against their will, conflicted with civil rights laws like the Fair Housing Act and Title VII, violated free speech rights, and acted with no legal authority at all.\r\n\r\nThat same day, the groups also asked for a temporary restraining order to stop HUD from spending the money under the new rules, to pause the September 30 deadline, and to make HUD keep the $75 million available while the case goes on. They are asking the court for declaratory judgment, injunctions, and attorneys’ fees, but not money damages.",

Case No. \nSCOTT TURNER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the United States Department of \nHousing and Urban Development \n451 7th Street, SW \nWashington, DC 20410, and \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nHOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, \n451 7th Street, SW \nWashington, DC 20410, \nDefendants. \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nINTRODUCTION \n1. Recognizing the pressing need to build more housing for homeless individuals\nand families, Congress appropriated $75 million for the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to award to nonprofits, states, or localities to build permanent supportive housing. \nAs it was required to do, HUD identified qualified projects and was prepared to award these \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 2 of 33 PageID #: 2\nessential funds, even going so far as to notify members of Congress of the selections. But, last \nweek, days before the funds are set to expire, it abruptly reversed course and is now seeking new \napplicants based on newly announced criteria. Under these new criteria, HUD will only award \nthose funds for projects in jurisdictions aligned with the Administration’s broader social policy \nviews and to applicants that will commit to them. And HUD is rushing the funds out the door, \npromising to award them during a 7-day period on a first-come, first-served basis for projects \nthat clear its ideological threshold.  \n2.  The new notice of funding opportunity disqualifies from consideration any entity \nseeking to build housing in a jurisdiction with policies the Administration disfavors. This means \nthere will be no funding for projects in a city or state that has not adopted the Administration’s \ndraconian approach to local homelessness policies and agreed to help enforce federal \nimmigration law. And, even in jurisdictions with policies the Administration deems acceptable, \nentities effectively cannot compete for funding unless they profess agreement with the \nAdministration’s view that sex is binary and immutable and foreswear operating safe injection \nsites or similar programs designed to reduce the harm from drug use—even with wholly non-\nfederal funds. \n3.  HUD does not have authority to do this—and the Constitutional does not permit \nit. In our constitutional system, Congress controls the purse strings and decides what funding to \nprovide, for what purposes, and under what criteria. And states and localities decide what \npolicies to adopt and implement in their own local jurisdictions. HUD has transgressed both \nthese bounds. HUD has likewise impermissibly trenched on states’ and localities’ powers by \ncoercing them to abandon the policies their own citizens have chosen and to implement the \nexecutive branch’s preferred policies instead. The new criteria conflict also with federal statutes \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 3 of 33 PageID #: 3\nand regulations, violate constitutional rights, did not go through required procedures, and are \narbitrary and capricious to boot.  \n4.  Both the process and substance of this new award process are shockingly \nunlawful and irreparably injure qualified applicants for these funds and the communities they \nserve, including Plaintiffs, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, on behalf of its members, \nand the Women’s Development Corporation, a Rhode Island a nonprofit that develops and \noperates quality, affordable housing. Through this lawsuit, Plaintiffs request that the Court halt \nthe current rushed, unlawful award process and preserve the funds at issue from expiration, \nallowing for their prompt award for projects that meet lawful criteria.    \nPARTIES \n5.  As set forth in its bylaws, Plaintiff National Alliance to End Homelessness \n(Alliance) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan membership organization that works to end homelessness \nin the United States and prevent its continued growth. The Alliance seeks to ensure that no \nAmerican is homeless by mobilizing all sectors of American society in an alliance to end \nhomelessness. The Alliance is located in Washington, D.C.  \n6.  The Alliance brings this lawsuit on behalf of its members, a robust coalition that \nworks to end homelessness through collaborative action and proven solutions. Alliance members \ninclude nonprofit organizations, service providers, practitioners, local researchers, local and state \ngovernment entities, and people with lived experience of homelessness—all of which are \ndedicated to ending homelessness and many of which receive HUD CoC grants. The September \n5 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) injures many of the Alliance’s members, such as \nWomen’s Development Corporation (WDC), by adopting unlawful criteria that render those \nmembers ineligible to compete for the CoC Builds funds. Many of these members, including \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 4 of 33 PageID #: 4\nWDC, would apply for the CoC Builds grants under the September 5 NOFO if they were \neligible, but are unable to do so because of the current criteria. Likewise, Alliance members who \nnevertheless move forward with the application are injured because their applications will be \nscreened and evaluated according to unlawful criteria. \n7.  The Alliance’s members play a significant role in the organization by guiding the \nAlliance’s agenda and activities through various means such as robust surveys and regular \nconvenings; by contributing financial support through conference fees and donations; and by \nsitting on the Alliance’s board and advisory bodies and helping to select the Alliance’s \nleadership. \n8.  Plaintiff Women’s Development Corporation is a nonprofit headquartered in \nRhode Island that develops and operates quality, affordable housing for low- and moderate-\nincome families, people with special housing needs, and seniors living in Rhode Island and \nsurrounding states. WDC has previously applied for HUD’s CoC Builds grant, and would apply \nfor that grant in the absence of the criteria at issue in this case, which render it ineligible. WDC \nis a member of the Alliance.  \n9.  Defendant Scott Turner is the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. He \nis sued in his official capacity.  \n10.  Defendant United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is an \nexecutive department of the United States federal government headquartered in Washington, \nD.C. 42 U.S.C. § 3532(a). HUD is an “agency” within the meaning of the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(1). \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 5 of 33 PageID #: 5\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because the \nclaims arise under federal law, including the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure \nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq. \n12.  The Court has authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide temporary, \npreliminary, and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and \n65, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, the All Writs Act, and the Court’s inherent equitable powers. \n13.  Venue is proper in the District of Rhode Island under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) \nbecause this action seeks relief against an agency of the United States and an officer of that \nagency acting in his official capacity and Plaintiff  Women’s Development Corp. resides in this \ndistrict. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The Administration leverages federal funding to advance unrelated policy goals and \nto punish jurisdictions with disfavored policies. \n14.  The Administration is leveraging federal funding to advance the President’s \nideological vision, including by blocking applicants from jurisdictions that do not comply with \nthat vision. Upon taking office in January 2025, President Trump issued a series of executive \norders that aim to effect sweeping social changes, including by directing agencies to terminate, \nwithhold, or condition federal funding to coerce federal funding recipients to fall into line with \nvarious Administration policies, and to discriminate against those that offer opposing viewpoints. \n1.  The Administration attacks sanctuary jurisdictions \n15.  Since taking office, the President has taken a series of actions designed to coerce \nstates and localities into helping enforce federal immigration law. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 6 of 33 PageID #: 6\n16.  On his first day in office, for example, the President issued an executive order \ndirecting the Attorney General and Department of Homeland Security to “ensure that so-called \n‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions”—jurisdictions that the Administration deems not to be sufficiently \ncooperative with federal immigration enforcement—“do not receive access to Federal funds.” \nProtecting the American People Against Invasion, § 17, 90 Fed. Reg. 8443, 8446 (Jan. 29, 2025). \nThis Executive Order also instructed those officials to take “any other lawful actions, criminal or \ncivil, that they deem warranted” to address those jurisdictions’ “interfere[nce] with” immigration \nenforcement. Id. \n17.  A month later, the President issued another executive order, this time directing all \nexecutive agencies to ensure that “Federal payments to States and localities do not, by design or \neffect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called \n‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.” Ending Taxpayer \nSubsidization of Open Borders, § 2(a), 90 Fed. Reg. 10581 (Feb. 25, 2025). That order further \ndirected White House offices to “recommend additional agency actions to align Federal \nspending” with the order’s purpose of making public benefits unavailable to undocumented \nimmigrants. Id. § 2(b). \n18.  Later, the President issued yet another executive order further aiming to punish \nso-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions that decline to use their resources on federal immigration \nenforcement. This order instructs the Attorney General to publish a list of “sanctuary \njurisdictions”—“States and local jurisdictions” that the Administration deems to “obstruct the \nenforcement of Federal immigration laws.” Protecting American Communities from Criminal \nAliens, § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. 18761 (May  2, 2025). It then instructs each federal agency to suspend \nor terminate federal funds, including grants and contracts, to those jurisdictions. Id. § 3(a).  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 7 of 33 PageID #: 7\n19.  DOJ published the ordered list of sanctuary jurisdictions on August 5, 2025. Press \nRelease, Off. of Pub. Affs., Justice Dep’t Publishes List of Sanctuary Jurisdictions (Aug. 5, \n2025), https://perma.cc/XQV6-D562. Rhode Island is included on that list. \n2.  The Administration attacks unhoused people’s rights \n20.  The Administration has also launched an attack on a resource that our most \nvulnerable citizens need: a rapid connection to permanent housing.  \n21.  On July 24, 2025, the President issued Exec. Order No. 14321, titled “Ending \nCrime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” 90 Fed. Reg. 35817 (Jul. 29, 2025) (“Unhoused \nPeople” Order). That Order portrays homelessness as a criminal issue rather than a societal \nchallenge requiring systemic solutions. Without citing any supporting sources or data sets, the \nOrder declares that “the overwhelming majority” of “individuals living on the streets in the \nUnited States” “are addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both.” The Order also \ndeclares that the “Federal Government and the States have spent tens of billions of dollars on \nfailed programs that address homelessness … leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety \nthreats.” The Order conflates unhoused people with perpetrators of crime despite data supporting \nthat individuals experiencing persistent homelessness are the ones actually at higher risk of \nviolent victimization.1  \n22.  Taking only a punitive approach to unhoused people which calls for “ending” all \n“‘housing first’ policies,” id. § 5, the Unhoused People Order urges increasing federal funding to \nmunicipalities that enforce laws prohibiting “urban camping,” “loitering,” and “urban squatting” \n \n1 Michelle S. Tong, et al., Persistent Homelessness and Violent Victimization Among Older \nAdults in the HOPE HOME Study,  J Interpers Violence 1, 1 (Sept. 2021),  \nhttps://perma.cc/REZ8-VDRD (finding that “[o]lder homeless adults experience high rates of \nvictimization,” and “[r]e-entering housing reduces this risk”). \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 8 of 33 PageID #: 8\nunder the guise of “fighting vagrancy,” id. § 3, going as far as inviting states to request federal \nlaw enforcement assistance from the Attorney General through 34 U.S.C. § 50101 for \n“encampment removal efforts” that displace people who are unhoused, id.  \n23.  The Unhoused People Order disparages “housing first” policies as “fail[ing] to \npromote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency.” Id. § 5. Additionally, the Order encourages \nthe involuntary institutionalization of unhoused people by asking state and local governments to \ncivilly commit people who are unhoused and force them into treatment. See Id. § 2.  \n24.  The Order also directs federal agencies to divert funds away from programs that \npromote non-punitive approaches toward “harm reduction” or “safe consumption” efforts so \nagencies can “prioritize available funding to support the expansion of drug courts and mental \nhealth courts.” Id. § 4(b).  \n3.  The Administration attacks transgender rights \n25.  The Administration has also launched a broadside attack on the rights and dignity \nof transgender people. \n26.  On January 20, the President issued Exec. Order No. 14168, titled “Defending \nWomen from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal \nGovernment.” 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 30, 2025) (“Gender Ideology” Order). That Order \nannounces that “the policy of the United States” is “to recognize two sexes, male and female,” \nthat are “not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.” Id. § 2. It \ndecries “the erasure of sex” in both “policy” and “language,” and it commits to using what the \nAdministration considers “accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically \nfemale, and men are biologically male.” Id. § 1. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 9 of 33 PageID #: 9\n27.  To accomplish its ideological vision, the “Gender Ideology” Order makes a host \nof directives, including requiring federal agency heads to “take all necessary steps, as permitted \nby law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology” and to “assess grant conditions and \ngrantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.” Id. § 3(e), (g). The \nOrder defines “gender ideology” as an ideology that “replaces the biological category of sex with \nan ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity” and “includes the idea that there is a \nvast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex.” Id. § 2(f). The Order disparages \nthis viewpoint as “false” and “internally inconsistent.” Id. \nB.  The HUD Continuum of Care program funds assistance for individuals and families \nexperiencing homelessness \n28.  Congress enacted the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (Homeless \nAssistance Act) in 1987 to establish a coordinated federal response to homelessness, including \nby providing funds for programs to assist homeless individuals and families. Pub. L. No. 100-77, \n§ 102 (1987), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 11301. \n29.  In 2009, Congress passed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid \nTransition to Housing (HEARTH) Act, which amended the Homeless Assistance Act to establish \nthe Continuum of Care (CoC) program, which is designed to help individuals and families \nexperiencing homelessness move into transitional and permanent housing, with the goal of long-\nterm stability. Pub. L. No. 111-22, § 1301(2) (2009), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 11381. Congress \ncreated the CoC program “to promote community-wide commitment to the goal of ending \nhomelessness,” to support efforts by nonprofit providers and state and local governments “to \nquickly rehouse homeless individuals and families,” to “promote access to, and effective \nutilization of, mainstream programs,” and to “optimize self-sufficiency among individuals and \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 10 of 33 PageID #:\n10\nfamilies experiencing homelessness.” 42 U.S.C. § 11381. The CoC program codifies a rehousing \napproach coupled with ongoing supportive services. See 42 U.S.C. § 11383. \n30.  The CoC Program funds a variety of programs that help homeless individuals and \nfamilies, including by constructing new housing units for permanent or transitional housing, \nrehabilitating structures to provide such housing, providing rental assistance, and offering \nsupportive services such as child care, job training, healthcare, mental health services, trauma \ncounseling, and life skills training. Id. §§ 11383(a), 11360(29).  \n31.  CoCs, the community-wide bodies responsible for coordinating homelessness \nresponse systems, provide essential services to millions of individuals and families experiencing \nhomelessness.  \n32.  In 2022, in addition to amounts appropriated for the CoC program generally, \nCongress appropriated $75 million for “one-time awards under the Continuum of Care program \nfor new construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation of new permanent supportive housing.” Pub. \nL. No. 117-328, 136 Stat. 4459, 5160 (2022). The appropriations act specifies that “these \namounts shall be awarded on a competitive basis, based on need and other factors to be \ndetermined by the Secretary, including incentives to establish projects that coordinate with \nhousing providers, healthcare organizations and social service providers.” Id. Those funds \nremain available until September 30, 2025. Id. at 5158. \nC.  Statutes and regulations govern HUD’s administration of the CoC grant program \n33.  Congress established statutory directives governing how HUD may administer the \nCoC Program and award CoC Grants, including delineating which activities are eligible for \nfunding, selection criteria that HUD must apply to awards, and the program requirements that \ngrantees must agree to as a condition of receiving funds. 42 U.S.C. §§ 11383; 11386a; 11386. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 11 of 33 PageID #:\n11\n34.  For instance, the Homeless Assistance Act requires the HUD Secretary to \nestablish certain “required” selection criteria that the Secretary must use to evaluate grant \napplications. See id. § 11386a (listing required criteria such as reducing length of homelessness, \nrehousing effectiveness, collaboration with schools, and success in serving high-risk \nsubpopulations). \n35.  The Act also specifies the “[r]equired agreements” to which grant recipients must \nagree to receive funds under the program. Id. § 11386(b). For instance, recipients must agree to \noperate funded projects in accordance with statutory requirements, to involve individuals \nexperiencing homelessness in project operations where practicable, and to certify that children in \nfamily programs are enrolled in school and connected to services such as Head Start and \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act programs. Id.  \n36.  The Homeless Assistance Act also authorizes the HUD Secretary to promulgate \nregulations establishing other terms and conditions on grant funding and other selection criteria \n“to carry out [the CoC program] in an effective and efficient manner.” Id. §§ 11386(b)(8); \n11386a(b)(1)(G); 11387.  \n37.   Pursuant to this authority, HUD promulgated a Rule implementing the \nContinuum of Care Program (CoC Rule). This Rule addresses “how to establish and operate a \nContinuum of Care, how to apply for funds under the program, and how to use the funds for \nprojects approved by HUD,” 77 Fed. Reg. 45422 (Jul. 31, 2012), and sets forth application \nrequirements and additional conditions to which CoC grant recipients and subrecipients must \nagree in their agreements. 24 C.F.R. §§ 578.19(b), 578.23(c).  \n38.  Recipients of funds under the CoC program must also comply with statutory and \nregulatory nondiscrimination requirements. For instance, HUD’s Equal Access Rule applies to \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 12 of 33 PageID #:\n12\nCoC-funded programs and requires, among other things, that grantees provide individuals equal \naccess to programs, shelters, benefits, services, and accommodations “in accordance with the \nindividual’s gender identity,” “place[], serve[], and accommodate[]” individuals “in accordance \nwith the[ir] gender identity,” “not subject[]” individuals “to intrusive questioning” or ask them to \nprovide evidence of their gender identity, and place individuals in facilities with shared sleeping \nquarters or bathing facilities according to their gender identity. 24 C.F.R. § 5.106.  \n39.  Additional statutes and regulations also constrain HUD’s administration of \nfinancial assistance programs more generally. \n40.  Under the HUD Reform Act of 1989, at least 30 days before any deadline to apply \nfor a grant, HUD must publish the criteria by which it will select awardees. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3545(a)(3). This requirement can be waived only if “required for appropriate response to an \nemergency.” Id. § 3545(a)(5). \n41.  HUD has also adopted regulations requiring it to proceed by notice-and-comment \nrulemaking including for “matters that relate to . . . grants,” “even though such matters would not \notherwise be subject to rulemaking by law or Executive policy.” 24 C.F.R. § 10.1 (“It is the \npolicy of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide for public participation \nin rulemaking with respect to all HUD programs and functions, including matters that relate to \npublic property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts . . . .”); Id. § 10.2 (definition of “rule”); Id. \n§§ 10.7–10.10 (notice-and-comment procedures); Yesler Terrace Cmty. Council v. Cisneros, 37 \nF.3d 442, 447, 448 (9th Cir. 1994). While the regulation has an exception for “statements of \npolicy, interpretative rules, rules governing the Department’s organization or its own internal \npractices or procedures, or if a statute expressly so authorizes,” it does not have an exception for \nsubstantive rules. See 24 C.F.R. § 10.1. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 13 of 33 PageID #:\n13\nD.  HUD imposes new eligibility and selection criteria for CoC Builds grants. \n42.  HUD has manufactured an extreme time crunch by waiting until the last minute to \nmake CoC Builds awards, despite having previously solicited and received eligible and \nmeritorious applications.  \n43.  In particular, HUD previously solicited applications for grants funded by \nCongress’s 2022 appropriation for construction or rehabilitation of permanent supportive \nhousing—named “CoC Builds” grants—two times, but did not make any awards either time. \n44.  First, HUD published a notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) for the CoC Builds \ngrants in July 2024, with an application deadline of December 5, 2024. Although HUD received \nand reviewed applications, it did not complete the process of making awards before the \nAdministration changed on January 20, 2025. The new Administration did not make awards \nfrom the existing application pool. \n45.  HUD then published a new NOFO to solicit applications for the CoC Builds \ngrants on May 16, 2025, with an application deadline of June 26, 2025. \n46.  HUD received and reviewed applications in response to that NOFO, made \nselections, and even notified Congress of who the agency had selected for awards. Yet, without \nexplanation, the agency never notified the awardees or executed any grant agreement. \n47.  Then, on September 5, 2025—less than one month before the $75 million in \nappropriated funds are set to expire—HUD published a new NOFO for the CoC Builds grants, \nthis time with an unprecedented (and unlawful) one-week deadline for applications, requiring \nsubmissions by September 12. (Funding Opportunity Number FR-6902-N-25A, available at \nhttps://simpler.grants.gov/opportunity/23e87946-467a-486f-b6c5-db8c6b3c2317.) The \nSeptember 5 NOFO is appended as Exhibit A to this Complaint. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 14 of 33 PageID #:\n14\n48.  It is nearly impossible for applicants to prepare application materials on that short \ntimeframe, particularly given that the September 5 NOFO requires funded programs to focus on \nmedical respite for elderly individuals and individuals with a physical disability, while the prior \nNOFOs did not require that focus. That change would require applicants to make dramatic shifts \nin their previously prepared project proposals. This change alone could trigger new and \nsubstantial architectural and engineering services; new regulatory approvals from local planning \nand zoning boards; approvals from local emergency management and transportation \ndepartments; approvals from local building and fire officials; and reviews from local historical \npreservation associations. \n49.  This additional work is exclusive of all the preliminary funding commitments an \napplicant would need to secure. For example, Plaintiff WDC secured additional funding \ncommitments that provide over 75% of the funding to support the WDC CoC Builds FY2025 \nproject under the May 2025 NOFO. \n50.  The September 5 NOFO states that HUD expects to make around eight awards. \n51.  The September 5 NOFO imposes multiple new eligibility and selection criteria \nunrelated to achieving the purposes of the grant program and designed instead to further the \nAdministration’s separate policy goals.  \n52.  The NOFO imposes multiple criteria designed to exclude projects based in any \nstate, county, or city with policies the Administration disfavors (collectively, Jurisdiction \nCriteria). In particular, the NOFO requires that the proposed project be located in a jurisdiction \n(state, county, city) that: \na.  Prohibits public camping or loitering and enforces that prohibition (Camping \nEnforcement Jurisdiction Criterion); \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 15 of 33 PageID #:\n15\nb.  Prohibits public illicit drug use and enforces that prohibition (Drug \nEnforcement Jurisdiction Criterion); \nc.  Prohibits urban squatting and enforces that prohibition (Squatting Enforcement \nJurisdiction Criterion); \nd.  Cooperates with federal immigration enforcement (Immigration Enforcement \nJurisdiction Criterion); \ne.  “Utilizes standards that address individuals who are a danger to themselves or \nothers” (Involuntary Commitment Jurisdiction Criterion); and \nf.  “Substantially implements and complies with SORNA, particularly in the case \nof registered sex offenders with no fixed address, including by adequately \nmapping and checking the location of homeless sex offenders” (SORNA \nJurisdiction Criterion). \n53.  The NOFO also imposes multiple criteria based on the applicant’s own activities, \nincluding activities outside the scope of the funded program (collectively, Applicant Criteria). In \nparticular, the applicant must state that:  \na.  It “does not,” and “will not,” “operate drug injection sites or ‘safe consumption \nsites,’ knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia on or off of property under their \ncontrol, permit the use or distribution of illicit drugs on property under their \ncontrol, or conduct any of these activities under the pretext of ‘harm \nreduction’” (Safe Drug Use Criterion); and \nb.  It “does not and will not deny the sex binary in humans or promote the notion \nthat sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic” (Sex Binary Criterion). \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 16 of 33 PageID #:\n16\n54.  The NOFO establishes a three-step process for reviewing awards, with unlawful \nnew criteria at each step, and often with the same criteria appearing at multiple steps.  \n55.  First is the “threshold review” step, at which HUD reviews each application to \nmake sure it meets specified “threshold requirements.” If an applicant meets all threshold \nrequirements, it will advance to the next step. If it does not meet all threshold requirements, the \napplication is not eligible for funding. \n56.  The “threshold” requirements include requirements that categorically disqualify \nprojects based in state and local jurisdictions with policies the Administration disfavors. In \nparticular, the “threshold” requirements include the Camping Enforcement Jurisdiction Criterion, \nthe Drug Enforcement Jurisdiction Criterion, the Squatting Enforcement Jurisdiction Criterion, \nand the Immigration Enforcement Jurisdiction Criterion. \n57.  Second is the “merit review” step. For this step, applicants must indicate—with a \n“yes” or “no” answer—whether they satisfy so-called “merit criteria.”  \n58.  The criteria at the “merit review” step include multiple requirements—both \nJurisdiction Criteria and Applicant Criteria—that advance the Administration’s unrelated \nideological goals at the expense of the purposes of the program Congress created. In particular, \nthe “merit” criteria include Camping Enforcement Jurisdiction Criterion, the Drug Enforcement \nJurisdiction Criterion, the Immigration Enforcement Jurisdiction Criterion, the Involuntary \nCommitment Jurisdiction Criterion, and the SORNA Jurisdiction Criterion, as well as the Safe \nDrug Use Criterion and Sex Binary Criterion. \n59.  Third, HUD conducts a “risk review,” ostensibly to evaluate each applicant’s \nlikelihood of successfully implementing an award.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 17 of 33 PageID #:\n17\n60.  The “risk review” looks at factors like the applicant’s financial stability, history of \nperformance, audit findings, and staffing structure. But the September 5 NOFO’s “risk review” \ncriteria also look to the “[e]xistence of evidence” that the applicant meets the Safe Drug Use \nCriterion and Sex Binary Criterion. \n61.  The NOFO states that HUD will make awards to the first applicants who meet the \n“threshold” criteria and answer “yes” to all the “merit” criteria, in the order of submission \ntimestamp. It does not state how HUD intends to apply the “risk review” criteria. \n62.  The New Criteria prescribe policy and are a rule subject to notice-and-comment \nrequirement under HUD’s regulations, 24 C.F.R. § 10.1, 10.2(a), yet HUD did not undertake \nnotice and comment in adopting them. \n63.  The practical effect of the New Criteria and HUD’s selection process is that \napplicants will not receive funding, or even have a chance to compete for it, if they operate in \nstates or other jurisdictions with policies the Administration disfavors or if they themselves \nengage in activities or express viewpoints that the Administration dislikes. \nE.  Plaintiffs are irreparably harmed by HUD’s new criteria for CoC Builds funding. \n64.  HUD’s new criteria injures many Alliance members by depriving them of a fair \nopportunity to compete for CoC Builds funding in one of two ways. \n65.  First, the Jurisdictional Criteria render many Alliance members ineligible for \nreasons entirely outside of their control. Namely, such members are ineligible simply because \ntheir projects are located in jurisdictions that have adopted policies that the administration does \nnot like—on issues that range from immigration to drug use.  \n66.  Many of these members would apply for the CoC Builds grants under the \nSeptember 5 NOFO, but are unable to do so—or are unable to have a fair opportunity to \ncompete—because of the Jurisdictional Criteria.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 18 of 33 PageID #:\n18\n67.  Under either scenario, Alliance members are ineligible if their proposed projects \nare located in any state that HUD would deem to fail to meet one or more of the Jurisdictional \nCriteria mentioned above. While the vagueness of the criteria make it difficult to identify every \njurisdiction that is excluded, the Department of Justice has compiled a list of “sanctuary \njurisdictions” (which the Department has concluded are not cooperating with the federal \ngovernment on immigration enforcement), as well as a list of jurisdictions that have not \nsubstantially implemented SORNA. On information and belief, HUD will consider projects that \nare located in states appearing on those lists to be ineligible for CoC Build funds under the \nJurisdiction Criteria. In addition to Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, those states \ninclude:  \na.  Alaska; \nb.  Arizona;  \nc.  Arkansas;  \nd.  California;  \ne.  Colorado;  \nf.  Connecticut;  \ng.  Delaware;  \nh.  Georgia;  \ni.  Hawaii;  \nj.  Idaho;  \nk.  Illinois;  \nl.  Indiana;  \nm.  Iowa;  \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 19 of 33 PageID #:\n19\nn.  Kansas;  \no.  Kentucky;  \np.  Maine;  \nq.  Massachusetts;  \nr.  Minnesota;  \ns.  Montana;  \nt.  Nebraska;  \nu.  Nevada;  \nv.  New Hampshire;  \nw.  New Jersey;  \nx.  New Mexico;  \ny.  New York;  \nz.  North Carolina;  \naa.  North Dakota;  \nbb.  Oregon; \ncc.  Pennsylvania;  \ndd.  Rhode Island;  \nee.  Texas;  \nff.  Utah;  \ngg.  Vermont; \nhh.  Washington;  \nii.  West Virginia; and  \njj.  Wisconsin.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 20 of 33 PageID #:\n20\n68.  The Alliance has members located throughout the above states, many of whom \nwould compete for the CoC Builds funding but are now unable to compete fairly under the New \nCriteria.   \n69.  For example, Alliance Member WDC proposed a project located in Rhode Island \nunder the May 2025 NOFO.   \n70.  HUD notified members of Congress that WDC was selected for an award under \nthe May 2025 NOFO. \n71.  However, under the new September 5 NOFO, WDC is now ineligible for the CoC \nBuilds funding because the project is located in Rhode Island—a jurisdiction that HUD likely \nwould deem not to meet various Jurisdiction Criteria, including the Immigration Enforcement \nJurisdiction Criteria and the SORNA Jurisdiction Criteria. Thus, although WDC would like to \ncompete for the CoC Build funds under the September 5 NOFO, WDC cannot do so, or cannot \nbe fairly considered, as a direct result of the Jurisdiction Criteria. \n72.  Second, other Alliance members who would like to compete for the CoC Build \nfunds are now ineligible because they do not meet one or both of the unlawful Applicant Criteria. \nBecause of the Applicant Criteria, such members will now either forgo applying altogether or \nthey will be effectively disqualified when they submit their application. \n73.  For example, Alliance member WDC would like to apply for the funds, but is \neffectively ineligible because it does not meet the Sex Binary Merit Criterion. Specifically,  \nWDC recognizes and provides culturally appropriate services to transgender and non-binary \npeople according to their gender identity.  \n74.  Absent preliminary relief, these members will be irreparably harmed because they \nwill be irretrievably deprived of the opportunity to compete for these funds. As noted, the NOFO \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 21 of 33 PageID #:\n21\nwas published on September 5, applications are due on September 12, and HUD intends to award \nfunds to the first approximately eight applicants who answer “yes” to the Merits Criteria, and to \nobligate those funds by September 15.  \n75.  Absent immediate relief, that application process will conclude tomorrow and the \nfunds will be obligated to other recipients imminently, thus permanently depriving Alliance \nmembers of the opportunity to compete for the CoC Build funds. \n76.  Beyond injuries to its members, the Alliance has also suffered a direct injury in \nthe form of an increased demand on its services, resulting in diverted resources and the loss of \nvaluable staff time. \n77.  The Alliance serves its members by (1) providing members with research and \nanalysis on solutions to end homelessness; (2) offering intensive, on-the-ground technical \nassistance tailored to its members’ local needs; and (3) convening members across the country—\nthrough annual conferences and other fora—to share best practices regarding how to end \nhomelessness.  \n78.  The Alliance also offers its members specific services regarding the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Continuum of Care (CoC) grant program, including \nanalysis and trainings on HUD’s priorities in the grant program. Such services facilitate the \nability of Alliance members to compete for and comply with grants issued under the program. \n79.  In addition to formal webinars and trainings, the Alliance answers requests from \nmembers for analysis on the CoC grant program priorities. These requests are received by email, \nphone, and through a Facebook group called the “Hub.”  \n80.  Since the September 5 NOFO, requests from Alliance members for analysis on \nthe CoC program—and the September 5 NOFO in particular—have skyrocketed. Indeed, nine \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 22 of 33 PageID #:\n22\nAlliance Staff have spent no less than 169 hours collectively answering questions and requests \nrelated to the September 5 NOFO. This valuable staff time is being diverted away from other \nimportant work at the Alliance.   \n81.  In fielding calls from the September 5 NOFO, the Alliance has learned the \nfollowing: many potential applicants do not feel like they can meet the criteria established in the \nNOFO; understanding HUD’s goals for this funding is challenging because even key terms used \nin the NOFO are undefined; one week is not enough time to develop high-quality projects and \nget required approvals from government officials or other required approvers; the application \nperiod does not allow for enough time to secure adequate funding to match the level of \nsupportive services required; some applicants feel like their time has been wasted by HUD given \nthe previous two application rounds; that the NOFO criteria disadvantages organizations that \nhave the most experience to take on this type of project; and that many applicants from previous \nrounds will not apply again.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act: In Excess of Statutory Authority (All New \nCriteria) \n82.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n83.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides that a court “shall” “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action” found to be “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n84.  An agency action is reviewable under the APA if it is a final agency action. 5 \nU.S.C. § 704. An agency action is final if it “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process” and is an action by which “rights or obligations have been determined, \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 23 of 33 PageID #:\n23\nor from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 156, 177–78 \n(1997) (cleaned up). \n85.  Defendants have made a final decision to impose the New Criteria for applying \nfor CoC Builds grants. Those New Criteria are final agency action reviewable under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 704, as they determine applicants’ rights and obligations and produce legal consequences by \nexcluding applicants from eligibility, or otherwise disadvantaging their applications, if they do \nnot meet the criteria. \n86.  No statute authorizes Defendants to withhold CoC Builds funding from projects \nin states and localities that do not implement the Administration’s ideological and policy agenda \nor to otherwise adopt any of the New Criteria. Defendants therefore acted in excess of their \nstatutory authority in imposing them. \n87.  The New Criteria must be declared unlawful and set aside as “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act: Arbitrary and Capricious (All New \nCriteria) \n88.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n89.  The APA provides that a court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” found to be “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n90.  Defendants provided no reasoned explanation for their decision to adopt the New \nCriteria. \n91.  Defendants failed to acknowledge their departure from past policies or explain the \nreasons for their change in policy in imposing the New Criteria. \n92.  Defendants ignored factors that Congress required them to consider and \nconsidered factors that Congress did not permit them to consider. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 24 of 33 PageID #:\n24\n93.  In imposing the New Criteria, Defendants have failed to consider multiple \nimportant aspects of the problem. There is no indication that Defendants considered best \npractices in homelessness policy, detrimental impact of the New Criteria on the communities \nserved by grantees, any alternative more limited policy change, or grantees’ reasonable reliance \non the opportunity to compete for the funds or the reliance interests of communities served by \ngrantees. \n94.  The Jurisdiction Criteria are also arbitrary and capricious because they are so \nvague that they do not give grantees adequate notice of how to determine whether they meet \nthem and invite arbitrary implementation by Defendants. Defendants also did not consider the \neffect that would have on prospective applicants, including by causing confusion that deters them \nfrom applying for fear of making a false statement. \n95.  The Sex Binary Criterion is also arbitrary and capricious because it conflicts with \nthe Fair Housing Act, Title VII, and binding agency regulations, yet Defendants fail to \nacknowledge or address those conflicts. \n96.  The New Criteria must be declared unlawful and set aside as arbitrary and \ncapricious. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act: Contrary to Constitutional Right (All New \nCriteria) \n97.   The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n98.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides that a court “shall” “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action” found to be “contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C.§ 706(2)(B). \n99.  As described in Counts V-VII and IX, the New Criteria violate multiple \nconstitutional commands, including the First Amendment, the Spending Clause, the Tenth \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 25 of 33 PageID #:\n25\nAmendment, and the constitutional separation of powers and associated constitutional \nprovisions. \n100.  The New Criteria must be declared unlawful and set aside as “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act: Not in Observance of Procedure Required \nBy Law (All New Criteria) \n101.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n102.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides that a court “shall” “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action” found to be “without observance of procedure required by \nlaw.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  \n103.  The requirement to observe procedure “required by law” includes not just \nprocedures required by governing statutes, but also procedures required by the agency’s own \nregulations. \n104.  Defendants did not publish the criteria for selecting awardees at least 30 days \nbefore the deadline to apply, as required by the HUD Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3545(a)(3). No \nemergency justified that failure.  \n105.  Defendants also did not comply with the requirement in the Uniform \nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, \nwhich HUD has adopted, 24 C.F.R §§ 84, 85, that no funding opportunity be available for less \nthan 30 calendar days absent exigent circumstances. 2 C.F.R. § 200.204 (previously codified at \n§ 200.203).  \n106.  The New Criteria imposed on applications for CoC Builds grants comprise a \nsubstantive rule, but HUD did not comply with the notice-and-comment requirements set forth in \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 26 of 33 PageID #:\n26\nits own regulations, and thus failed to observe procedures required by HUD regulations, 24 \nC.F.R. § 10.1. \n107.  The New Criteria must be declared unlawful and set aside as “without observance \nof procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the Separation of Powers (All New Criteria) \n108.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n109.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution, including the separation of powers. See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010). \n110.  The Constitution empowers Congress to make laws, U.S. Const. art. I, § 1, and to \ncontrol federal spending, U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 1; id., § 9, cl. 7, and it requires the President \nto faithfully execute those laws, id. art. II, § 3. The President lacks the unilateral authority to \nmodify or amend duly enacted Legislation—the President may only “approve all the parts of a \nBill, or reject it in toto.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 439–40 (1998) (citation \nomitted); see U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, cl. 2. The President cannot delegate powers to other \nexecutive branch officials that violate the Constitution. \n111.  Duly enacted statutes establish the CoC grant program for specified purposes, and \nCongress has appropriated funding for permanent supportive housing under the CoC grant \nprogram. Nothing in those laws authorizes the Executive Branch to impose the New Criteria. \nDefendants may not lawfully condition funding on the New Criteria, which are nowhere to be \nfound in statute and which Congress did not authorize Defendants to impose. \n112.  Defendants’ imposition of each New Criteria violates the separation of powers in \ninfringing on Congress’ legislative authority and spending and appropriations power, in failing to \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 27 of 33 PageID #:\n27\nfaithfully execute Congress’s laws, and in attempting to amend, modify, or partially veto duly \nenacted legislation. \n113.  To prevent Defendants’ violations of the separation of powers, Defendants must \nbe enjoined from implementing or enforcing each New Criteria. \nCOUNT VI \nViolation of the Spending Clause (All New Criteria) \n114.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n115.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution. See Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491. \n116.  The Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress”—not the \nExecutive—“shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the \nDebts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . .” U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n117.  Under the Spending Clause, funding restrictions may only impose conditions that \nare reasonably related to the federal interest in the project and the project’s objectives, South \nDakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207, 208 (1987), and must not be so severe as to be coercive, \nNat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577–78 (2012).  \n118.  Even if Congress had delegated authority to the Executive and HUD to condition \nCoC Builds grant funding on the policies of local jurisdictions or on the applicant’s activities and \nviewpoints outside the scope of the funded program, the New Criteria would violate the \nSpending Clause because they are not germane to the stated purpose of HUD program funds. In \naddition, by barring organizations operating within jurisdictions with disfavored policies, the \nJurisdiction Criteria unconstitutionally coerce those jurisdictions to adopt the Administration’s \nagenda. \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 28 of 33 PageID #:\n28\n119.  To prevent Defendants’ violations of the Spending Clause, Defendants must be \nenjoined from implementing or enforcing each New Criteria. \nCOUNT VII \nViolation of the Tenth Amendment (All Jurisdiction Criteria) \n120.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n121.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution. See Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491. \n122.  The Tenth Amendment provides that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United \nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people.” U.S. Const. amend X.   \n123.  Legislation that “coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own” \n“runs contrary to our system of federalism.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus., 567 U.S. at 577–78 \n(2012). \n124.  The Jurisdiction Criteria violate the Tenth Amendment by imposing criteria that \ncoerce states and localities to adopt the Administration’s agenda as their own. The Jurisdiction \nCriteria do not just exclude the jurisdictions themselves from consideration—and allow the \njurisdictions to determine whether to take the funds subject to the criteria or leave them—but \nexclude organizations operating within those jurisdictions from consideration as well. This \nblacklisting of organizations based in the targeted jurisdictions works greater coercion than \nmerely imposing conditions on the jurisdictions themselves would. The Jurisdiction Criteria thus \nthreaten to improperly commandeer state and local officials into adopting and implementing the \nAdministration’s favored policies. \n125.  To prevent Defendants’ violations of the Tenth Amendment, Defendants must be \nenjoined from implementing or enforcing each Jurisdiction Criteria. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 29 of 33 PageID #:\n29\nCOUNT VIII \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act: Contrary to Law (Sex Binary Criterion) \n126.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n127.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides that a court “shall” “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action” found to be “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n128.  The Sex Binary Criterion is contrary to the Fair Housing Act and Title VII, which \nprohibit discrimination in housing and employment, respectively, on the basis of sex, including \ngender identity. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a)-(b), 42 U.S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1); see also Bostock v. Clayton \nCnty., 590 U.S. 644 (2020) (interpreting Title VII to prohibit discrimination based on gender \nidentity); see also Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affs. v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 576 U.S. \n519 (2015) (likening Fair Housing Act’s sex discrimination provisions to those of Title VII). \n129.  The Sex Binary Criterion is also contrary to HUD regulations requiring that, in \nCoC programs, individuals be treated in accordance with their gender identity. See 24 C.F.R. \n§ 5.106. \n130.  The Sex Binary Criterion must be declared unlawful and set aside as contrary to \nlaw. \nCOUNT IX \nViolation of the First Amendment – Free Speech Clause (Sex Binary Criterion) \n131.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n132.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution. See Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491. \n133.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the \ngovernment “shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 30 of 33 PageID #:\n30\n134.  While the government may in some circumstances attach conditions to federal \nfunding that “affect the recipient’s exercise of its First Amendment rights,” there are limits. \nAgency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214–15 (2013). The \ngovernment may not restrict “protected [speech] outside the scope of the federally funded \nprogram.” Id. at 217 (citing Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 197 (1991)). In addition, even in \nproviding what recipients may do with government funding, “the Government may not aim at the \nsuppression of dangerous ideas.” Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 \n(1998) (cleaned up). And where the government imposes a funding condition “not relevant to the \nobjectives of the program,” that can violate the First Amendment. See All. For Open Soc’y, 570 \nU.S. at 214. \n135.  The Sex Binary Criterion runs afoul of those limits. \n136.  The Sex Binary Criteria imposes a viewpoint-based bar on applicants that “deny \nthe sex binary in humans or promote the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic”—\nthat is, applicants who express a viewpoint that the Administration disfavors. This curtails \napplicants’ speech outside the scope of the federally funded program and punishes applicants \nbased on that speech. \n137.  The Sex Binary Criterion also has no relevance to the CoC Builds program’s \npurposes of creating permanent supportive housing for individuals and families experiencing \nhomelessness, but rather aims at the suppression of an idea with which the Administration \ndisagrees. That censorious purpose and lack of relation to the objectives of the CoC program \nadditionally render it unconstitutional under the First Amendment. \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 31 of 33 PageID #:\n31\n138.  No compelling government interest justifies Defendants’ viewpoint-based \ntargeting of speech, and the Sex Binary Criterion is not the least restrictive means available to \nadvance whatever interest the criteria serve. \n139.  The Sex Binary Criterion violates the First Amendment, and Defendants must be \nenjoined from enforcing or implementing it. \nCOUNT X \nUltra Vires (All New Criteria) \n140.  The paragraphs above are incorporated and reasserted as if fully set forth here. \n141.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin and declare unlawful executive \nultra vires conduct. R.I. Dep’t of Env’t Mgmt. v. United States, 304 F.3d 31, 42 (1st Cir. 2002). \nAn agency acts ultra vires when it “plainly acts in excess of its delegated powers.” Fresno Cmty. \nHosp. & Med. Ctr. v. Cochran, 987 F.3d 158, 162 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (cleaned up). \n142.  No statute, constitutional provision, or other source of law authorizes Defendants \nto impose the New Criteria.  \n143.  The New Criteria are ultra vires, and Defendants must be enjoined from \nimplementing or enforcing them. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.  Declare unlawful, vacate, and set aside the New Criteria; \nB.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants, their agents, and all persons acting in \nconcert or participation with Defendants from imposing or implementing the New \nCriteria, or any substantively similar criteria, on any HUD CoC awards in any manner, \nincluding by requiring applicants to meet the criteria to be considered for an award or to \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 1     Filed 09/11/25     Page 32 of 33 PageID #:\n32\nreceive an award, by considering those criteria in selecting awardees, or by requiring \ngrantees to comply with such criteria upon obtaining an award; \nC.

At the end of the day on September 30, 2025, the appropriations act that had been \nfunding the Department of Justice expired and those appropriations to the Department lapsed.  The same \nis true for the majority of other Executive agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development HUD).  The Department does not know when such funding will be restored by \nCongress. \n2.  Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and HUD employees are \nprohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including \n“emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.”  31 U.S.C. § 1342.   \n3.  Undersigned counsel for the Department of Justice therefore requests a stay of current \ndeadlines until Congress has restored appropriations to the Department. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00447-MSM-AEM     Document 20     Filed 10/03/25     Page 2 of 2 PageID #:\n257\n4.  If this motion for a stay is granted, undersigned counsel will notify the Court as soon as \nCongress has appropriated funds for the Department.  The Government requests that, at that point, all \ncurrent deadlines for the parties be extended commensurate with the duration of the lapse in \nappropriations – i.e., each deadline would be extended by the total number of days of the lapse in \nappropriations.  \n5.  Opposing counsel has authorized counsel for the Government to state that the plaintiffs \noppose this motion. \n  Therefore, although we greatly regret any disruption caused to the Court and the other litigants, \nthe Government hereby moves for a stay of current deadlines in this case until Department of Justice \nattorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions. \n \nDated: October 3, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n \nBRETT A.
