American  Oversight  brings  this  action  to  seek  information  about  Corey \nLewandowski’s role at the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), including his status as a \nSpecial Government Employee (“SGE”).  \n2.  Lewandowski, a political operative who was campaign manager for President \nTrump’s 2016 presidential campaign and reportedly had personal and professional ties to DHS \nSecretary Kristi Noem during her time as governor of South Dakota, has reportedly developed an \n“outsized influence” at DHS, despite the supposed temporary nature of his role as an SGE.1   \n3.  An SGE is “anyone who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 \n \n1 See Brittany Gibson & Marc Caputo, Scoop: White House Suspicious of Lewandowski's \n“Temp” Work, Axios (Aug. 14, 2025), https://www.axios.com/2025/08/14/white-house-dhs-\nlewandowski-noem (reporting on Lewandowksi’s “outsized influence”). \n  1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03113-TNM     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 2 of 10\ndays or less in a 365-day period.”2  \n4.  According to public reporting, Lewandowski has become DHS Secretary Noem’s \n“gatekeeper,” and is her “de facto chief of staff.”3 \n5.  Lewandowski is currently serving as Chief Advisor to DHS Secretary Noem.4 \n6.  Yet Lewandowski does not appear on the list of senior leaders on the DHS website.5  \n7.  As of August 14, 2025, DHS claimed that Lewandowski had only performed 69 \ndays of work for the department, but multiple individuals within the administration believe this \nnumber to be a “gross undercount.”6 \n8.  Lewandowski reportedly has taken multiple measures to avoid documentation that \nhe has worked additional days beyond those reported.  \n9.  Lewandowski  “enter[s]  government  buildings  with  other  employees  to  avoid \nswiping his own badge.”7 \n10.  A recent news report stated that Lewandowski “doesn't always use his government \n \n2 Summary of Government Ethics Rules for Special Government Employees, U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice (Feb. 6, 2006), https://www.justice.gov/jmd/ethics/summary-government-ethics-rules-\nspecial-government-employees; see also 18 U.S.C. § 202(a).  \n3 Tarini Parti et al., How Corey Lewandowski Became Kristi Noem’s Gatekeeper at DHS, Wall \nSt. J.

On information and belief, Lewandowski uses his personal phone and email for \nofficial business.9 \n12.  Despite the murky status of Lewandowski’s official role, he exercises wide-ranging \nauthority across a broad range of subject matters that fall under the purview of DHS.  \n13.  Some  meetings  scheduled  with  Secretary  Noem  are  “routed  through \nLewandowski.”10 \n14.  Lewandowski  has  veto  power  over  DHS  contracts  and  grants  that  exceed \n$100,000.11  \n15.  Lewandowski has made a number of personnel decisions, including directing \nfirings and requesting that certain employees be placed on administrative leave.12 \n16.  Lewandowski’s outsized role at DHS has also raised ethical concerns.  \n17.  As an SGE, Lewandowski is a “public filer” as defined by 5 C.F.R. § 2634.202(c).  \n18.  Lewandowski is required to file a financial disclosure report.13 \n19.  Lewandowski has not filed a public financial disclosure report. \n20.  On information and belief, Lewandowski has not received a waiver from filing such \n \n8 Gibson & Caputo, supra note 1. \n9 See id. \n10 Parti, supra note 3. \n11 Myah Ward & Zack Colman, Lewandowski’s Veto Power over DHS Contracts Frustrates \nAdmin Officials: ‘Corey Is Part of the Problem’, Politico (Aug. 27, 2025, 5:55 AM), \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/27/tk-00527043.  \n12 See Alvarez, supra note 3.  \n13 See 5 U.S.C. § 13103(f) (stating that certain special Government employees falls within the \nambit of this section), 5 C.F.R. § 2634.202(c) (same); 5 C.F.R. § 2634.201(b)(1) (noting that for \nnew entrants, “an individual must file a public financial disclosure report” within 30 days); 5 \nU.S.C. § 13103(h) (stating that someone who actually “performs the duties of the office or \nposition for more than 60 days in a calendar year” must file a disclosure “within 15 days of the \n60th day”); 5 C.F.R. § 2634.204(c) (same).    \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03113-TNM     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 4 of 10\na financial disclosure report.  \n21.  SGEs “may not engage in outside employment or any other outside activity that \nconflicts with their official duties.” 5 C.F.R. § 2635.802(a). \n22.  Lewandowski has said that he “doesn’t engage in private business related” to DHS, \nbut he declined to disclose if he has private clients.14 \n23.  The Wall Street Journal reported that federal records show that DHS “fast-tracked” \na contract, which “didn’t follow an open and competitive process,” to a political consultant with \nwhom Lewandowski previously worked on a political campaign.15 \n24.  Lewandowski’s failure to file a financial disclosure report, his refusal to disclose \nwhether he has maintained private clients—including whether he has any private clients with \nbusiness before the agency—and the possibility that he has worked more days as an SGE than \nhave been documented raise questions about his compliance with other laws and regulations that \napply to SGEs.  \n25.  Plaintiff American Oversight has submitted several requests to DHS under the \nFreedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (“FOIA”), including the three FOIA requests at issue \nin this lawsuit, to shed light on Lewandowski’s role and actions during his time at DHS. \n26.  Having received no records or determinations in response to its requests, American \nOversight now brings this action against the agency under FOIA and the Declaratory Judgment \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to compel compliance \nwith the requirements of FOIA.  \n \n14 Parti, supra note 3. \n15 Id.  \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03113-TNM     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 5 of 10\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2201, and 2202. \n28.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(e)(1). \n29.  Because Defendant has failed to comply with the applicable time-limit provisions \nof FOIA, American Oversight is deemed to have exhausted its administrative remedies pursuant \nto 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i) and is now entitled to judicial action enjoining Defendant from \ncontinuing to withhold department or agency records and ordering the production of department \nor agency records improperly withheld. \nPARTIES \n30.  Plaintiff  American  Oversight  is  a  nonpartisan,  non-profit  section  501(c)(3) \norganization primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. American Oversight is \ncommitted to promoting transparency in government, educating the public about government \nactivities, and ensuring the accountability of government officials.

As of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has failed to (a) notify American \nOversight of final determinations regarding American Oversight’s FOIA requests, including the \nscope of responsive records Defendant intends to produce or withhold and the reasons for any \nwithholdings; or (b) produce the requested records or demonstrate that the requested records are \nlawfully exempt from production. \n46.  Through Defendant’s failure to respond to American Oversight’s FOIA requests \nwithin the time period required by law, American Oversight has constructively exhausted its \nadministrative remedies and seeks immediate judicial review. \nCOUNT I \n \nViolation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 \nFailure to Conduct Adequate Searches for Responsive Records \n47.  American  Oversight  repeats  the  allegations  in  the  foregoing  paragraphs  and \nincorporates them as though fully set forth herein.   \n48.  American Oversight properly requested records within the possession, custody, and \ncontrol of Defendant. \n49.  Defendant is an agency subject to FOIA, and it must therefore make reasonable \nefforts to search for requested records. \n50.  Defendant has failed to promptly review agency records for the purpose of locating \nthose records that are responsive to the American Oversight’s FOIA requests. \n51.  Defendant’s failure to conduct adequate searches for responsive records violates \nFOIA and applicable regulations. \n52.  Plaintiff American Oversight is therefore entitled to injunctive and declaratory \n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03113-TNM     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 9 of 10\nrelief requiring Defendant to promptly make reasonable efforts to search for records responsive to \nAmerican Oversight’s FOIA requests. \nCOUNT II \n \nViolation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 \nWrongful Withholding of Non-Exempt Responsive Records \n53.

American Oversight properly requested records within the possession, custody, and \ncontrol of Defendant.   \n55.  Defendant is an agency subject to FOIA and must therefore release in response to \nFOIA requests any non-exempt records and provide lawful reasons for withholding any materials.  \n56.  Defendant is wrongfully withholding non-exempt agency records requested by \nAmerican Oversight by failing to produce non-exempt records responsive to American Oversight’s \nFOIA requests.  \n57.  Defendant’s failure to provide all non-exempt responsive records violates FOIA \nand applicable regulations. \n58.  Plaintiff American Oversight is therefore entitled to declaratory and injunctive \nrelief requiring Defendant to promptly produce all non-exempt records responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests and provide indexes justifying withholdings of any responsive records \nwithheld under claims of exemption. \nREQUESTED RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, American Oversight respectfully requests the Court to: \na)  Order Defendant to conduct a search or searches reasonably calculated to uncover all \nrecords responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests; \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03113-TNM     Document 1     Filed 09/10/25     Page 10 of 10\nb)  Order Defendant to produce, within twenty days of the Court’s order, or by such other date \nas the Court deems appropriate, any and all non-exempt records responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests and indexes justifying the withholding of any responsive \nrecords withheld under claim of exemption;  \nc)  Enjoin Defendant from continuing to withhold any and all non-exempt records responsive \nto American Oversight’s FOIA requests;  \nd)  Award American Oversight the costs of this proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ \nfees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in this action, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4)(E); and  \ne)  Grant American Oversight such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \nDated: September 10, 2025    Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Daniel Martinez \nDaniel Martinez \nD.C.
