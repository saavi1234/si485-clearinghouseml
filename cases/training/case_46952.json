In the midst of a foster-care crisis, the Massachusetts Department of Chil-\ndren and Families (“DCF”) has begun revoking the licenses of Christian foster par-\nents based on their religious beliefs. Even though DCF is desperately short on foster \nfamilies, it now requires every family to promise that they will use a child’s chosen \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 2 of 37\npronouns, encourage a child to transition socially and medically, and otherwise af-\nfirm a child’s stated gender identity when it conflicts with the child’s sex. If a family \ndoes not walk in lockstep with DCF’s radical demands, DCF revokes their license—\neven if the family cares only for infants or close family members or a child for a few \nhours during respite care. And in Massachusetts, automatic affirmation is the only \nacceptable route—no matter that transgender identities in children are highly un-\nstable, that most children will naturally learn to accept and identify with their nat-\nural bodies, or that social and medical “transitioning” have no proven benefits for a \nchild’s mental or physical health. \n2.  The Plaintiff families here, the Joneses and the Schrocks, were licensed fos-\nter-care families in the state of Massachusetts. These families host young children \nand have successfully provided homes to 35 foster children in Massachusetts. Both \nfamilies were in good standing during their time as foster parents and provided sup-\nportive and loving homes to the children in their care. \n3.  Both families will provide a loving and respectful home for any child, includ-\ning transgender, gay, or lesbian foster children. But that is insufficient for Massa-\nchusetts. The Joneses and Schrocks will soon lose or have lost their foster-care li-\ncenses because they could not sign a document promising to automatically “pro-\nmote,” “support” and “affirm” a hypothetical child’s gender identity or gender ex-\npression against their religious convictions, all of which Massachusetts requires un-\nder the rubric of “affirmation.” (“Gender Identity Policy”). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 3 of 37\n4.  DCF’s Gender Identity Policy infringes on Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights in \nseveral ways. First, the State requires the Joneses and the Schrocks to promise to \nuse a child’s chosen pronouns, verbally affirm a child’s gender identity contrary to \nbiological sex, and even encourage a child to medically transition, forcing these fam-\nilies to speak against their core religious beliefs. \n5.  Second, DCF infringes on Plaintiffs’ free-exercise rights through a policy that \nis not neutral or generally applicable. Licensing involves a system of individualized \nassessments. For example, DCF emphasizes matching to pair children with families \nbest suited for them and grants discretionary exemptions to ensure that children \nare placed in the right home, like permitting parents to decline to host children \nbased on age, sex, medical needs, behavioral needs, history of abuse, and disability, \nor just because it’s not a good fit. But DCF provides no flexibility when it comes to \nautomatically affirming a child’s stated gender identity and sexuality. A foster par-\nent must promise in advance to use opposite-sex pronouns and encourage a hypo-\nthetical child’s gender transition, even if they never have and never will host a child \nwho struggles to accept their natural body. \n6.  Further, DCF regulations do not require parents to “affirm” a child’s gender \nidentity. Yet DCF requires parents to sign a form promising to do so anyway. This \nensures that parents willing to love and support any child are disqualified just be-\ncause they cannot “affirm” behaviors and beliefs that contradict their faith. Nor do \nthe regulations set out what is required to “support and affirm” children’s gender \nidentity and sexuality; rather, DCF and its employees have chosen to interpret the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 4 of 37\nrelevant regulation in a way that specifically disqualifies many Christian and other \nreligious foster parents. \n7.  DCF’s Gender Identity Policy violates the First Amendment. DCF has chosen \nto condition foster-care licenses on Christians’ willingness to renounce their beliefs \nin both speech and practice.  \n8.  The policy is also bad for the Commonwealth’s foster children—to the point of \ncruelty. Massachusetts is in desperate need of foster families. Foster children are \nsleeping in state offices because there’s no family to take them. Children are shuf-\nfled between short-term homes and subjected to maltreatment, harming their fu-\nture chances of achieving stability and permanence. And DCF is even willing to re-\nmove young infants and toddlers with no understanding of “gender identity” from \nloving homes because of their Christian beliefs, creating more trauma for the most \nvulnerable members of society. Rather than broaden the tent and find loving homes \nfor children—which is supposed to be DCF’s reason for existence—DCF has chosen \nto revoke licenses from families who refuse to think as DCF demands. DCF’s actions \noffend the Constitution and common decency.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This action raises federal questions under the First and Fourteenth Amend-\nments to the United States Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983. \n10.  This Court has original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1343. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 5 of 37\n11.  This Court has authority to award the requested declaratory relief under 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201–02 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 57; the requested injunctive relief under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1343 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65; and the requested costs and attorney fees un-\nder 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 54. \n12.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(1) and (2) because \na substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in \nthe District of Massachusetts; the effects of the challenged statute are felt in this \nDistrict; and the Defendants can and do perform official duties in this District. \nPLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS \n13.  Plaintiff Audrey Jones is a resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts. She \nwas a licensed foster parent in the Commonwealth from 2023 to 2025. \n14.  Plaintiff Nicholas “Nick” Jones is a resident of Worcester County, Massachu-\nsetts. He was a licensed foster parent in the Commonwealth from 2023 to 2025. \n15.  Plaintiff Greg Schrock is a resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He \nwas a licensed foster parent in the Commonwealth from 2019 to 2025. \n16.  Plaintiff Marianelly Schrock is a resident of Middlesex County, Massachu-\nsetts. She was a licensed foster parent in the Commonwealth from 2019 to 2025. \n17.  Defendant Dr. Kiame Mahaniah is the Secretary of the Massachusetts Execu-\ntive Office of Health and Human Services. Dr. Mahaniah is responsible for the poli-\ncies and decisions of DCF pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 6A, § 16. His office \nis located in Boston, Massachusetts.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 6 of 37\n18.  Defendant Staverne Miller is the Commissioner of DCF. She is responsible \nfor the regulations of policies of DCF pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 18B, \n§§ 6–7. \n19.  Defendant Lori-Ann DiBella is the manager of the Northern Regional Licens-\ning Unit of DCF. She was ultimately responsible for the decision to discontinue the \nSchrocks’ foster-care license. \n20.  Defendant Sarah Petty is a supervisor in the Northern Regional Licensing \nUnit of DCF. She reviewed and approved the recommendation to discontinue the \nSchrocks’ foster-care license. \n21.  Defendants are sued in their official capacities only. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nMassachusetts’ Foster Care Crisis \n22.  DCF’s decision to pull licenses from Christian families comes in the midst of \na foster-care crisis in Massachusetts. The Commonwealth has more children than it \ncan provide homes, a disproportionate number of allegations of mistreatment, and \nno actionable solutions. \n23.  More than 6,500 children are in the Massachusetts foster-care system, but \nthe state only has 5,100 licensed foster homes. 1,482 of the children in the state’s \ncare—more than 20% of the total—are not placed with a family.1 \n \n1 Mass.

The lack of homes for foster children was labeled a “crisis” beginning in 2019 \nwhen an investigation of the Boston Globe revealed that some Massachusetts foster \nchildren were left with nowhere to live, even sometimes spending the night in their \nsocial worker’s car.2 \n25.  That same investigation revealed that Massachusetts had one of the worst \nrecords in the country for providing stable foster-care homes. In 2018, the state \nmoved one-third of all foster children at least three times during their first year in \nthe foster-care system. Id.  \n26.  The crisis has continued largely unabated. In 2023, an investigation by a Bos-\nton NBC affiliate showed that the state was renting out rooms for “child-sitting” be-\ncause it didn’t have enough beds for all of the children in its care.3 \n27.  One social worker described the situation to NBC as a “placement crisis.” Id.  \n28.  Nor have placements improved. A 2023 examination found that 47% of Mas-\nsachusetts foster children are moved at least three times per year. That makes the \nstate the third-worst in the nation for stable foster-care homes.4 \n \n2 Kay Lazar, In a broken foster system, some kids can’t find a bed for the night, Bos-\nton Globe (April 6, 2019), https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/04/06/state-bro-\nken-foster-system-some-kids-can-find-bed-for-\nnight/40xAjxIIT0errJZVjSiY5H/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link. \n \n3 Social worker describes ‘placement crisis’ for kids in care of Mass. DCF, NBC 10 \nBoston (September 12, 2023), https://www.nbcboston.com/investigations/social-\nworker-describes-placement-crisis-for-kids-in-care-of-mass-dcf/3134362/.  \n \n4 Massachusetts Foster Care Survey, Survey Results, HopeWell (last visited August \n27, 2025), https://hopewellinc.org/whats-happening/massachusetts-foster-care-sur-\nvey/#results. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 8 of 37\n29.  The homes that are available are often unsafe for children. DCF’s own report-\ning shows that maltreatment of foster children is high and increasing. In 2023, be-\ntween 214 and 621 children experienced maltreatment in DCF care.5 This is a his-\ntorical problem in the state, which was second in the nation for recurrent of abuse \nand neglect for foster children in 2022 (the latest year for which data was availa-\nble).6 \n30.  Facing this crisis, DCF has decided to substantially narrow the pool of eligi-\nble foster parents by excluding everyone who will not promise to support and affirm \na child’s sexual orientation and gender identity. \n31.  Not only is this requirement discriminatory, it will dramatically reduce the \nnumber of foster homes in the Commonwealth. \n32.  Scholarly examination of this topic suggests that this will exclude between \none-half and two-thirds of all eligible foster parents. See David M. Smolin, Kids Are \nNot Cakes: A Children’s Rights Perspective on Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 52 \nCumb. L. Rev. 79, 143 (2022).  \nFoster-Care Licensure in Massachusetts \n33.  Becoming a licensed foster family in Massachusetts is a multi-stage process. \n \n5 The Editorial Board, The whole point of foster care is to keep kids safe. So DCF \nmaltreatment reports should set off alarms, The Boston Globe (December 15, 2024), \nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/15/opinion/foster-care-dcf-maltreatment-re-\nports/. \n \n6 Child Welfare Outcomes Report Data, Children’s Bureau, Admin. of Child. and \nFams., U.S. Dep’t of Health and Hum. Servs. (2022), https://cwout-\ncomes.acf.hhs.gov/cwodatasite/recurrence/index/.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 9 of 37\nDCF’s policies for this process are contained in a document entitled “Licensing of \nFoster, Pre-Adoptive, and Kinship Families,” which is attached as Exhibit 1 to this \nComplaint.  \n34.  DCF’s policy states that it “does not deny any adult the opportunity to be-\ncome a foster family on the basis of race, color, age, biological sex, ethnicity, marital \nstatus, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, creed, ancestry, \nnational origin, language, disability or veteran’s status.” \n35.  To become a licensed foster family, a family must first participate in an infor-\nmation session and submit an application. Ex. 1 at 13–14. \n36.  After a family submits an application, DCF performs background checks on \nthe members of the household over the age of 15, and a recruiter performs a home \nvisit. See Ex. 1 at 14. At the home visit, the recruiter provides information about the \nlicensing process.  \n37.  If the family’s “home meets the basic housing requirements; all household \nmembers lack a disqualifying criminal or child welfare history; and the Recruiter \nand their supervisor recommend that the family proceed,” the family moves to the \n“Caregiver Training and Assessment” stage. Ex. 1 at 16.  \n38.  During the Caregiver Training and Assessment stage, the family is required \nto undergo certain training sessions while DCF attempts to “evaluate the prospec-\ntive family’s caregiving capacity.” Ex. 1 at 18.  \n39.  The Caregiver Assessment is a detailed investigation of the applicant family. \nA social worker visits the family three times, including at least two home visits. Ex. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 10 of 37\n1 at 19. The social worker also interviews each parent separately at least once and \ntogether at least once. During the interview, the social worker asks about the par-\nents’ “history, trauma history, cultural beliefs, and motivation and how these im-\npact parenting style and skills; expectations of and understanding of a foster fam-\nily’s role and responsibilities; mental health history, substance/alcohol use, and re-\nlationship history and how each could affect their caregiving ability; parenting ex-\nperience and attitude towards parenting; understanding of and use of the protective \nfactors to strengthen families; and understanding of the concepts they are learning \nabout in training.” Id. In practice, the social worker will also provide the family \nwith written questions regarding these topics, which the family answers in writing. \n40.  DCF must perform this assessment in accordance with Massachusetts regu-\nlation 110 C.M.R. 7.104, which establishes the state’s “Standards for Licensure as a \nFoster/Pre-adoptive Parent.”  \n41.   110 C.M.R. 7.104 contains requirements for foster families and their homes. \nThe regulation states that an applicant parent must demonstrate the ability to ac-\ncomplish 17 different goals “to the satisfaction of the Department.” 110 C.M.R. \n7.104(1). These requirements are subjective. They include things like the ability “to \ndeal with difficult issues in the child’s background” and the ability “to respect and \nmake efforts to support the integrity of a child’s racial, ethnic, linguistic, cultural \nand religious background.” \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 11 of 37\n42.   Included in this list is the ability “to promote the physical, mental, and emo-\ntional well-being of a child placed in his or her care, including supporting and re-\nspecting a child's sexual orientation or gender identity.” 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d). \n43.  Regulation 110 C.M.R. 7.104 contains a long list of other requirements, as \nwell, including having a home that meets 18 separate standards contained in 10 \nC.M.R. 7.105. \n44.  Some of the requirements for foster families in 110 C.M.R. 7.104 and 7.105 \nare waivable. DCF may waive the requirements of 1) U.S. citizen status, 110 C.M.R. \n7.104(6); 2) the requirement that a child’s bedroom be at least 50 square feet, 110 \nC.M.R. 7.105(7); and 3) the limits on the number of children in one home, 110 \nC.M.R. 7.105(12)(b).  \n45.  After performing the home visits and other investigative steps, the social \nworker puts together a caregiver assessment, which includes the family’s applica-\ntion, the results of any background checks, a summary of the worker’s interviews, \nan assessment of the family’s caregiving capacity, and a licensing recommendation. \n46.  This caregiver assessment is then reviewed by a license review team, which \ndecides whether to grant the family a license. \n47.  After a family is granted a foster-care license, DCF’s licensing agents perform \nannual assessments of their license. See Ex. 1 at 28; 110 C.M.R. 7.113. But in prac-\ntice, this often does not occur in a timely manner. \n48.  During an annual assessment, a licensing agent performs a home visit to dis-\ncuss “any significant events or changes in the last year, including how they \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 12 of 37\nimpacted caregiving ability, if applicable; experiences living with foster/pre-adoptive \nchild(ren) in the past year; identified strengths and challenges; what trainings, ser-\nvices, and supports were helpful in the past year; and what trainings, services, and \nsupports the foster family needs to feel successful in the upcoming year.” Ex. 1 at \n29.  \n49.  The licensing agent then writes an “annual update to the Caregiver Assess-\nment.” Ex 1 at 29. This update “evaluates the foster parents’ ongoing ability to ful-\nfill the requirements of a foster parent and meet the needs of foster children \nthrough their knowledge of and use of the protective factors.” Id.  \n50.  The licensing agent then meets with their supervisor and “[t]ogether, they \nrecommend whether or not to continue licensing.” Ex. 1 at 30. The Area Program \nManager then makes a final decision. Id. \n51.  DCF’s licensure policies and procedures described above involve extensive in-\ndividualized assessment of foster families at the initial licensure and annual review \nstages. DCF can exercise its discretion in licensing a family and in deciding whether \nto renew a license each year. \n52.  Social workers, licensing agents, and DCF are given discretion to apply and \ninterpret the relevant standards to each individual family based on their own judg-\nment and understanding of DCF policy. \n53.  For example, each of the criteria for licensure eligibility in 110 C.M.R. \n7.104(1) must be met “to the satisfaction of the Department.” The regulation does \nnot give any objective standards. Additionally, each of the criteria is subjective. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 13 of 37\nNone provides objective standards or measurements by which to judge a particular \napplicant or foster family.  \nPlacement of Children with Foster Families \n54.  Both parents and DCF exercise discretion to achieve a good fit in placements. \n55.  For example, after a family is licensed and thus becomes eligible for place-\nment, a family always has the right to say no. Placements are always optional, and \nDCF must “provide the prospective foster/pre-adoptive parent with sufficient infor-\nmation about the child to enable the foster/pre-adoptive parent to determine \nwhether to accept placement of the child.” 110 C.M.R. 7.112(1). \n56.  Families may also give DCF parameters for which placements they are able \nor willing to accept. DCF policy notes that “Placement recommendations take into \naccount any wishes of the foster/pre-adoptive parents about the type of child they \nwant to foster and the capacities of the foster parent.” Ex. 1 at 45. Families fre-\nquently indicate limitations related to age, sex, disability, medical needs, history of \nabuse, or behavioral issues. And DCF does not disqualify or penalize families for \nstating that they will not accept children over a certain age, of a certain sex, or with \ncertain behavioral issues. \n57.  The information DCF is required to provide includes “the service plan for the \nchild, behavior management guidelines and techniques, the child's medical needs, \nthe child's educational needs, current health and education information and/or rec-\nords available, legal status and any other special conditions or requirements.” 110 \nC.M.R. 7.112(1). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 14 of 37\n58.  DCF also exercises discretion to promote children’s best interests. Massachu-\nsetts law instructs DCF to make all out-of-home placements “in the best interests of \nthe child, based upon safety, well-being and permanency of the child and the child’s \nindividual needs.” 110 C.M.R. 7.101(1).  \n59.  DCF can even place children in homes that are not licensed, such as placing \nchildren in fictive “kinship” homes, even though the home is not a blood relative.  \nDCF’s New Gender Identity Policy \n60.  110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) requires that foster family “demonstrate … the ability \nto … support[ ] and respect[ ] a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity.” \n61.  From 2009 to 2023, DCF did not require foster families to make promises \nthat they would verbally promote the Department’s views on issues of gender or \nsexuality. \n62.  That changed sometime around 2023 to 2024, when DCF began requiring fos-\nter families to sign a “Foster Parent Agreement” attached as Exhibit 2 to this Com-\nplaint, in which the family agrees that it will speak and act in certain ways.  \n63.  By signing the Foster Parent Agreement, a foster family promises that they \nwill “[s]upport, respect, and affirm the foster child’s sexual orientation, gender iden-\ntity, and gender expression.” Ex. 2 at 3. \n64.  DCF has also promulgated another document, its “LGBTQIA+ Nondiscrimi-\nnation Policy,” that specifies what the Department means by “support, respect, and \naffirm” and is attached as Exhibit 3 to this Complaint. \n65.  While the LGBTQIA+ Nondiscrimination Policy’s plain terms dictate how \nDCF will treat a foster child, DCF informs foster families that the policy also sets \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 15 of 37\nthe standard for what it means for a foster family to “support, respect, and affirm” a \nchild’s sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. By signing the \nFoster Parent Agreement, a foster family is agreeing to comply with the LGBTQIA+ \nNondiscrimination Policy’s terms. \n66.  The LGBTQIA+ Nondiscrimination Policy requires certain types of speech \nand actions. Among other things, a foster family must: “accept[ ] a child’s assertion \nof their LGBTQIA+ identity and allow[ ] children to use their expressed names and \npronouns at any time,” “address[ ] children by their names and pronouns,” “sup-\nport[ ] gender-neutral practices regarding clothes and physical appearance” includ-\ning “gender-affirming clothing, such as binders, packers, body shapers, bras, breast \ninserts, and similar items in a timely manner,” and provide children with culturally \nresponsive and affirming … medical care, mental health care, and community re-\nsources, including gender-affirming care when applicable.” Ex. 3 at 3–4. \n67.  Further, the policy also prohibits foster parents from engaging in certain \nspeech and actions. It prohibits “attempts to convince LGBTQIA+ children/youth to \nreject or modify their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression,” or \nto “impose … personal, cultural, and/or religious beliefs on children and families in-\nvolved with the Department.” Ex. 3 at 4. \n68.  Consistent with the Gender Identity Policy, DCF requires parents to “pro-\nmote,” “support,” and “affirm” a child’s gender identity and expression in all of these \nareas. In other words, Plaintiffs must agree to encourage and affirm a child’s desire \nto go by chosen pronouns and a chosen name, and to engage in a medical \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 16 of 37\n“transition.” And Plaintiffs are prohibited from sharing their contrary religious be-\nliefs that God created us male and female, that a person’s gender and sex are objec-\ntively rather than subjectively determined, and that the body itself witnesses to \nGod’s perfect design. E.g., supra ¶¶ 76–81. \n69.  If a family declines to sign this agreement, they cannot receive a foster-care \nlicense. DCF will not waive or modify the provision related to sexual orientation, \ngender identity, and gender expression in any way. Nor will DCF address the issue \non a case-by-case basis by seeking to match children with families according to their \nneeds and particular circumstances.  \n70.  DCF’s policy has no religious exemption. If a family’s religion does not permit \nthem to use opposite-sex pronouns or encourage a child to socially and medically \ntransition, they must choose between their religion and a foster-care license. \n71.  Previously licensed families who cannot sign the Foster Parent Agreement \nwill have and have had their license revoked or discontinued. \nNick and Audrey Jones \n72.  Nick and Audrey Jones are a Christian couple living in Worcester County, \nMassachusetts. They have been a licensed foster family since 2023 and currently \nprovide foster care to children under the age of six.  \n73.  The Joneses’ have one current foster placement: a 17-month-old girl who has \nlived with the Joneses for nearly her entire life. Over the past two years, they have \nprovided foster care to seven children, including most recently (during this past \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 17 of 37\nsummer) a pair of sisters who are two and four years old. They also have two biolog-\nical children. \n74.  Because of Nick and Audrey’s Christian faith, DCF intends to discontinue or \nrevoke their foster-care license and remove their foster child from their home.  \n75.  Nick and Audrey are Christians who attend a home church every week on \nSunday and read the Bible with their children. They take seriously the implications \nof their faith in their day-to-day lives.  \n76.  Nick and Audrey believe that the Bible teaches that people are created as \nmale and female and cannot change that fact. They believe that using opposite-sex \npronouns or making efforts to change one’s gender is wrong. This is a strongly held \nreligious conviction for the Joneses and millions of other Christians, Jews, and Mus-\nlims throughout the country.  \n77.  The Joneses believe that the bodies of men and women represent God’s crea-\ntional design. One’s perception of one’s body is not the determining factor in eluci-\ndating personal identity. The body itself witnesses to God’s design and intent for liv-\ning life for his glory as a man or a woman. In this way, what is natural reflects what \nis spiritual. In their biblical worldview, the Joneses teach children about the good-\nness of their God-given body. \n78.  The Joneses believe that Scripture will not allow any such changing of the \nbody from male to female or vice versa. The body is not an impediment to one’s true \nself or a blank canvas for a person to mold to their own image; rather, the body is \nthe gift of God and a temple for the Holy Spirit. The testimony of Genesis signals \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 18 of 37\nGod’s direct action in forming men and women: “Male and female he made them,” a \ndeclaration honored by Jesus in his day (Genesis 1:27; Matthew 19:4–5). According \nto their beliefs, the body is not distinct from one’s personal identity; the body consti-\ntutes one’s divinely mandated identity.  \n79.  The Joneses believe that it is not “caring” to encourage children to change \ntheir bodies to fit a perceived “gender identity.” Such action goes against the fixed \nnature of the body and also reflects an unwise rejection of the commonly known \nprinciple that children need time to understand their personal identity. The Joneses \nbelieve that true care of children helps children to embrace the goodness of God’s \ndesign of their body, not countermand it.  \n80.  The Joneses believe that biblical and compassionate care honors this scrip-\ntural principle. They believe all people deserve this care as all are affected by sin. \nSuch care is thus not unloving; it is deeply loving and consonant with the character \nof the Savior who called the little children to himself, affirming their God-given dig-\nnity in a historical context that often failed to do so (Matthew 18:1–6). \n81.  They believe that the Bible teaches that marriage is a covenant between one \nman and one woman. Similarly, they believe that sex is only proper between a mar-\nried man and woman. \n82.  Nick and Audrey believe they could provide a loving home for any child, in-\ncluding children identifying with a gender other than that of their biological sex, or \na child who identifies as gay or lesbian. In the event of a conflict related to gender \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 19 of 37\nidentity related issues, the Joneses would always seek to prioritize the child’s best \ninterests while still staying true to their beliefs. \n83.  There are certain DCF requirements with which they categorically cannot \ncomply with because of their religious beliefs, including using a child’s chosen pro-\nnouns that conflict with the child’s biological sex, verbally affirming a child’s desire \nto identify as the opposite sex (or no sex), or encouraging a child to undergo a social \nor medical gender “transition.” \n84.   Then there are other hypothetical requirements or conflicts which they \nwould approach on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the child’s age, ma-\nturity, and the nature of their relationship with the child. For example, if a child \nwanted to attend an event with which they disagreed, they would listen respect-\nfully, evaluate whether this is an event the child could attend on their own or \nwhether the child would require a parent to chaperone them, and seek to find a \nworkaround to any conflicts of conscience. They would take this approach for any of \ntheir children to always ensure that their children are first and foremost safe. \nThroughout any conflict, they would always assure the child that they uncondition-\nally loved him or her no matter how the child identifies and no matter what disa-\ngreements they may have.  \n85.  In 2025, the Joneses received the new Foster Parent Agreement for the first \ntime as part of their annual license review. \n86.  During the home visit portion of the annual review, the DCF licensing agent \nasked Audrey about the Joneses’ views on LGBTQ issues and, specifically, whether \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 20 of 37\nthe Joneses could support and affirm a child’s gender identity and sexual orienta-\ntion. Audrey informed the agent that she believes the Joneses could provide a loving \nand safe home for any child, but described the view recited in paragraphs 76–82. \n87.  Later, the licensing agency relayed a copy of the Foster Parent Agreement \nover email, along with a series of questions about the Joneses’ views on LGBTQ is-\nsues.  \n88.  Audrey informed the agent that, based on the Joneses’ religious views, they \ncould not sign the Foster Parent Agreement. They cannot support a child dating \nsomeone of the same sex or affirm a child who wanted to use different pronouns.  \n89.  In response, the Joneses’ licensing agent stated that continuing their license \n“won’t work.” DCF relayed that there were no exemptions from signing the Foster \nParent Agreement form. The Joneses license was up for renewal in July of 2025 and \nhas expired, but they have yet to receive an official revocation or discontinuation \nletter from DCF. \n90.  The Joneses have learned that DCF intends to remove their foster daugh-\nter—a 17-month-old infant who is totally unaffected by DCF’s Gender Identity Pol-\nicy—from their home only because they are Christians and cannot agree to sign the \nFoster Parent Agreement clause that requires them to violate their faith. Not only \ndoes this violate the Joneses’ First Amendment rights, it will be detrimental for \ntheir foster daughter, who has never known other parents. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 21 of 37\nGreg and Marianelly Schrock \n91.  Greg and Marianelly Schrock are a Christian couple living in Middlesex \nCounty, Massachusetts. They have two biological children and were a licensed fos-\nter family from 2019 to 2025. They cared for 28 separate foster children over those \nsix years. They were an excellent foster family who provided a loving and support-\ning home to children throughout their entire time as foster parents.  \n92.  In June 2025, Massachusetts discontinued the Schrock’s foster-care license \nbecause of their Christian beliefs about sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n93.  Greg and Marianelly are devoted Christians who attend a non-denomina-\ntional church every Sunday, read the Bible, and take the teachings of their faith se-\nriously. \n94.  In fact, the Schrocks became foster parents because of their faith. They un-\nderstand the teachings of the Bible to require that Christians take special care of \nwidows and orphans, see James 1:27, and they believe that foster care is a way they \ncan live out their faith. Greg and Marianelly were faithful and active foster parents \nfor six years in large part because of their faith. \n95.  The Schrocks believe that the Bible teaches that human beings are created as \nmale or female and that an individual cannot change the fact of their God-gifted \nsex.  \n96.  They believe that the bodies of men and women represent God’s creational \ndesign. One’s perception of one’s body is not the determining factor in elucidating \npersonal identity. The body itself witnesses to God’s design and intent for living life \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 22 of 37\nfor his glory as a man or a woman. In this way, what is natural reflects what is spir-\nitual. In their biblical worldview, the Schrocks teach children about the goodness of \ntheir God-given body. \n97.  The Schrocks believe that Scripture does not permit efforts to change the \nbody from male to female or vice versa. The body is not an impediment to one’s true \nself; the body is the gift of God. The testimony of Genesis signals God’s direct action \nin forming men and women: “male and female He created them,” a declaration hon-\nored by Jesus in his day (Genesis 1:27; Matthew 19:4–5). According to their beliefs, \nthe body is not distinct from one’s personal identity; the body constitutes one’s di-\nvinely mandated identity.  \n98.  The Schrocks believe that it is not “caring” to encourage children to change \ntheir bodies to fit a perceived “gender identity.” Such action goes against the fixed \nnature of the body and also reflects an unwise rejection of the commonly known \nprinciple that children need time to understand their personal identity.

They believe that using opposite-sex pronouns or making efforts to change \none’s gender is false, wrong, and violates biblical principles.  \n101.  The Schrocks also believe that the Bible teaches that marriage is a covenant \nbetween one man and one woman. Similarly, they believe that sex is only proper be-\ntween a married man and woman. \n102.  These beliefs do not affect Greg and Marianelly’s ability to provide a loving \nhome for all children. They believe, and their extensive experience as foster parents \nshows, that they could provide a loving home for any child, including children who \nidentify as a gender different than their biological sex, or as gay or lesbian.  \n103.  Despite this, DCF has discontinued the Schrocks’ foster-care license because \nof their religious beliefs. \n104.  For Greg and Marianelly, the Department’s anti-religious bigotry began \nwhen they were first licensed in 2019. During a training module on LGBT issues, \nMarianelly asked how the training translated to their obligations as foster parents \nwhen they were signing up to foster toddlers and babies. Because they asked a \nquestion about LGBT issues, the Schrocks were singled out for a special meeting \nwith DCF staff. \n105.  In that meeting, DCF singled out the Schrocks’ religious beliefs. DCF staff \nasked if the Schrocks would read their foster children the portions of the Bible that \nsay homosexuality is a sin. The Schrocks answered honestly regarding their beliefs \non sexuality and reading the Bible. The licensing process continued, but the \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 24 of 37\nSchrocks were told that it would be cause for concern if they tried to “pray the gay \naway.”  \n106.  This pattern continued in 2025. In December, 2024, the Schrocks received no-\ntice that their annual reassessment was beginning. In the home visit portion of the \nassessment, the licensing agent mentioned the 2019 meeting about the Schrocks’ re-\nligious beliefs. She then asked if having an LGBT child placed in the home would be \na problem for the family. The Schrocks informed her that it would not. \n107.  Later, the licensing agent sent the Schrocks an email stating she needed to \nschedule a visit to sign the new Foster Parent Agreement. The Schrocks asked for \nan advance copy of the Foster Parent Agreement form but didn’t receive one until a \nweek later after asking a second time. \n108.  A week after the Schrocks received the Foster Parent Agreement, they \nlearned from their resource worker that internally DCF officials believed that they \n(the Schrocks) would not sign the Foster Parent Agreement and that it would be \nnecessary to close their home. This revelation came before the Schrocks explained \ntheir religious objections to the problematic clause on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity.  \n109.  Within a few days, Marianelly sent DCF an email explaining that: “Our hope \nis that we can continue to serve displaced children as we have for the last six years. \nTo this end, we request that an exemption be allowed for our religious convictions \non this point. Our convictions remain as they have been throughout our time as fos-\nter parents, during which we have taken long-term placements and numerous \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 25 of 37\nrespite placements. As with each of those cases, we willingly defer to DCF as to \nwhether our home is best equipped to care for the unique situation of each child. We \nlove all children. We support and respect all children. However, we cannot in good \nconscience overlook the implications of this affirmation clause.” \n110.  After the Schrocks sent this email, they met with DCF on March 27, 2025. In \nthis meeting, which included Sarah Petty, the Schrocks informed DCF that their re-\nligious beliefs did not allow them to use opposite-sex pronouns or affirm a child’s \ngender identity if it did not align with their biological sex. In response, Petty told \nthe Schrocks that the Foster Parent Agreement wasn’t just about ensuring that \nchildren were affirmed, but that it was also about being respectful to other family \nmembers, uncles, aunts, and that this is what was expected of them in society in \ngeneral. In that meeting, DCF told the Schrocks that there was no possibility of ex-\nemption, and they must sign the agreement or lose their foster-care license. \n111.  After the meeting, the Schrocks attempted one last time to preserve their li-\ncense. In an email to DCF, they said: “To summarize our viewpoint: We are happy \nto sign the DCF Foster Parent Agreement, except for the contents of line 6, which \nrequires us to approve, facilitate, and agree with practices that contradict our reli-\ngious beliefs. We agree with the fundamental dignity of every human and the re-\nspect that must accompany that… could you please confirm that an exemption for \nline 6 is off the table?” \n112.  On June 2, 2025, DCF discontinued the Schrocks’ foster-care license. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 26 of 37\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nClaim I \nFirst Amendment Free Speech \n113.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n114.  The First Amendment forbids any law “abridging the freedom of speech, or of \nthe press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n115.  Facially and as applied, 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) requires applicants to agree \nto speak certain words, like opposite-sex pronouns, and to engage in certain expres-\nsive activities, like affirming romantic relationships that express DCF’s preferred \nviews on human sexuality, as a condition for obtaining a foster-care license. \n116.  Because the DCF conditions foster-care licenses on an applicant’s willingness \nto speak certain words and engage in certain expressive activities, 110 C.M.R. \n7.104(1)(d) compels speech. \n117.  110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) does not serve any valid or compelling interest in a \nnarrowly tailored way, and there are many less restrictive alternatives to achieving \nthe State’s legitimate goals that do not infringe on free-speech and free-association \nrights. \n118.  In addition to compelling speech, DCF restricted Plaintiffs’ speech based on \ntheir viewpoint. \n119.  Facially and as applied, 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) forbids applicants from ex-\npressing certain views, like the Plaintiffs’ religious views on human sexuality, and \nengaging in certain expressive activities, like reading scripture in their home, as a \ncondition for obtaining a foster-care license. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 27 of 37\n120.  Because DCF compels applicants to speak and express the DCF’s preferred \nviews on human sexuality while prohibiting speech expressing other views it regu-\nlates speech based on content and viewpoint, it engages in unconstitutional view-\npoint discrimination. \n121.  Foster families are permitted to speak on issues of gender identity and sexual \norientation, but only if their speech espouses the viewpoint favored by DCF. If foster \nfamilies speak on those issues in a way that does not “support and affirm” a child’s \ngender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation, the agency will revoke \nthat family’s foster-care license. \n122.  This is classic viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment’s \nFree Speech Clause.  \nClaim II \nFirst Amendment Free Speech—Overbreadth \n \n123.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n124.  DCF’s Gender Identity Policy punishes a substantial amount of speech by \nMassachusetts foster families. \n125.  Because the law, among other things, compels speech and discriminates \nbased on viewpoint, it is unconstitutional as applied to a substantial amount of the \nspeech in its ambit.  \n126.  In contrast to its unconstitutional applications, the Gender Identity Policy \nhas relatively few constitutional applications. \n127.  The law is therefore an unconstitutionally overbroad regulation of speech. \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 28 of 37\nClaim III \nFirst Amendment Free Exercise of Religion \n \n128.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n129.   The First Amendment forbids any law prohibiting or penalizing the free ex-\nercise of religion. U.S. Const. amend. I. \n130.  A plaintiff may demonstrate a free-exercise violation by showing that their \nreligious exercise was burdened by a law that is not generally applicable or neutral. \n131.  The Plaintiffs’ religious exercise was and is substantially burdened by DCF’s \nrevocation of their foster-care licenses. \n132.  Specifically, DCF, through the Foster Parent Agreement, will not grant a fos-\nter-care license to a person unless that person agrees to use chosen pronouns or cho-\nsen names, affirm that gender is fluid, encourage children to “transition,” and ver-\nbally affirm romantic relationships that go against their beliefs.  \n133.  This substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ religious exercise by forcing them to \nchoose between the opportunity to become foster and adoptive parents and staying \ntrue to their religious convictions. \n134.  110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) is not neutral nor generally applicable because it im-\nposes special disabilities based on religious beliefs, categorically excludes people \nfrom foster-care licenses based on religious beliefs, prefers certain religious and sec-\nular beliefs over the Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs, and provides for categorical and in-\ndividualized exemptions without extending an exemption to religious persons like \nPlaintiffs. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 29 of 37\n135.  DCF’s licensing regulations and procedures allow for exemptions of certain \npolicies but not for those related to affirming a child’s sexual orientation and gender \nidentity. They also allow for individualized review of each foster family and place \nsignificant discretion in DCF employees as to the licensure of each individual fam-\nily.  \n136.  Because DCF’s policy is not neutral or generally applicable, it triggers strict \nscrutiny. But DCF’s policy does not serve any valid or compelling interest in a nar-\nrowly tailored way, and there are many less restrictive alternatives to achieving the \nState’s legitimate goals that do not infringe Plaintiffs’ free-exercise rights. \n137.  Additionally, 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) requires applicants to agree to speak cer-\ntain words, like opposite-sex pronouns, and to engage in certain expressive activi-\nties, like affirming same-sex relationships, that express DCF’s preferred views on \nhuman sexuality, as a condition for obtaining a foster-care license. \n138.  These expressive activities substantially burden Plaintiffs’ religious exercise \nand violate their conscience.  \n139.  DCF has therefore placed an unconstitutional condition on a Massachusetts \nfoster-care license. In order to obtain such a license, Plaintiffs must promise to \nspeak and act in a way that violates their religious beliefs.  \n140.  By conditioning Plaintiffs’ ability to receive a foster-care license on their will-\ningness to give up their First Amendment rights, 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) imposes an \nunconstitutional condition on them in violation of their First Amendment rights. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 30 of 37\n141.  Further, “[a] plaintiff may also prove a free exercise violation by showing that \n‘official expressions of hostility’ to religion accompany laws or policies burdening re-\nligious exercise.” Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 525 n.1 (2022). \n142.  DCF violated Plaintiffs’ Free Exercise rights by revoking their foster-care li-\ncense after making statements demonstrating religious animus. \n143.  Among other things, DCF displayed hostility toward Greg and Marianelly \nSchrock’s religious beliefs and warned them not to “pray the gay away.”  \n144.  DCF training materials also warn that children have a “right to be free from \nreligious indoctrination that condemns or puts down [their] sexual orientation or \ngender identity or expression,” and “[n]o one should make negative comments to \n[them]” about these topics, suggesting that Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs on these top-\nics are invalid. \n145.  The stereotype and assumptions present in DCF’s statements and training \nmaterials show religious animus. Combined with DCF’s subsequent revocation of \nthe Schrocks’ foster-care license based on their religion, DCF’s actions violate the \nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  \nClaim VI \nFourteenth Amendment Equal Protection \n \n146.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n147.  The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees “the equal protection of the laws.” \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \n148.  110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d), as applied by DCF, excludes applicants with religious \nbeliefs the Department disfavors. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 31 of 37\n149.  By excluding the plaintiffs from foster-care licensure because of their reli-\ngious beliefs, 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) invidiously discriminates based on religion and \ntreats the plaintiffs worse than similarly situated persons who do not share their re-\nligious beliefs. \n150.  Additionally, by excluding the plaintiffs from foster-care licensure based on \ntheir viewpoints regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, 110 C.M.R. \n7.104(1)(d) invidiously discriminates based on viewpoint and treats the plaintiffs \nworse than similarly situated persons who do not share their views. \n151.  Accordingly, DCF’s application of 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) violates the Equal \nProtection Clause. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment against Defend-\nants and provide Plaintiffs with the following relief: \na.  A declaration that 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d), facially and as applied to Plain-\ntiffs and similarly situated foster-care applicants, violated and continues \nto violate their constitutionally protected rights to free speech, free associ-\nation, religious exercise, due process, and equal protection of the law; \nb.  A preliminary and permanent injunction to stop Defendants, and any per-\nson acting in concert with them, from enforcing 110 C.M.R. 7.104(1)(d) to \ndeny Plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons a license to foster or \nto adopt based on constitutionally protected rights to free speech, free as-\nsociation, religious exercise, due process, and equal protection of the law; \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-12449     Document 1     Filed 09/03/25     Page 32 of 37\nc.  That this Court award Plaintiffs’ costs and expenses in this action, includ-\ning reasonable attorney fees in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 1988; \nd.  That this Court adjudge, decree, and declare the rights and other legal re-\nlations of the parties to the subject matter here in controversy so that \nthese declarations shall have the force and effect of a final judgment; \ne.  That this Court retain jurisdiction of this matter for the purpose of enforc-\ning its orders; \nf.  That this Court issue the requested injunctive relief without a condition of \nbond or other security required of Plaintiffs; and \ng.
