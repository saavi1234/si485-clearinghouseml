Mr. Taylor is an American Citizen and a White male. \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 2 of 40\n2.  Ms.  Romak is an experienced corporate security professional who has \nworked for Shell Energy Resources, Shell Exploration & Production, Shell Pipeline \nand Shell USA, Inc. for the last 17 years. She has been employed in the Corporate \nSecurity Division (U.S.CS), based in Houston, Texas, since August 1, 2022. Ms. \nRomak is an American citizen, a White female, and a Military Veteran who served \nin a time of war. \n3.  Mr. Hutt has been a Shell employee for nearly fifteen (15) years. He has \nheld the position of Country Security Manager for Shell USA, Inc., based in Houston, \nfor over eight (8) years. Mr. Hutt is an American Citizen, a White male, and a Military \nVeteran who served during the Cold War. \n4.  On January 9, 2025, Mr. Hunt, Regional Security Manager (RSM) for \nCorporate Security Americas, announced a pretextual departmental reorganization, \nwhich was racially discriminatory.  \n5.  This reorganization eliminated the three White employees from the \nCorporate Security Division (U.S.CS) at Shell, USA, Inc. in Houston, Texas, and \nreplaced each with someone of color with less experience and objectively weaker \nqualifications. \n6.  Further,  the  people  of color  already  working  in Corporate  Security \nduring this reorganization were not subject to the same requirements and processes \nas the three White employees. \n7.  Each replacement had lesser qualifications than the White employee \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 3 of 40\nthey replaced.  \n8.  Instead of selecting the more qualified Mr. Taylor or Ms. Romak, Ms. \nChevez, a Hispanic female with a background as an administrative assistant was \ngiven the Houston-based Security Advisor South role.  \n9.  Ms. Velazquez, a Hispanic female, was initially assigned the Security \nAdvisor  West  role,  which  Mr.  Taylor  applied  for.  However,  Ms.  Velazquez  was \nultimately found unqualified for this U.S. based role because she was a foreign \nnational lacking U.S. citizenship, and she had to be replaced.   \n10.  Mr.  Hunt  then  promoted  Ms.  Velazquez  to  the  Country  Security \nManager for Mexico. \n11.  Thereafter,  instead  of  selecting  the  most  qualified  for  the  Security \nAdvisor West role (Mr. Taylor, who was already passed over for the Houston-based \nrole), Mr. Hunt awarded the position to Mr. Erazo, a Hispanic male, even though Mr. \nErazo was a contractor, not a Shell employee.  \n12.  Mr. Erazoโs contract had been in the process of being terminated in \nDecember of 2024 for poor performance. \n13.  Mr. Jackson, an African American male with no background in the \nprotection of persons and assets, or in executive protection, replaced Mr. Hutt as U.S. \nCountry Security Manager.  \n14.  Mr. Hunt awarded Mr. Taylor a less desirable position as Security \nAdvisor  East  within  Corporate  Security  in  a  different  region,  necessitating  his \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 4 of 40\nrelocation to Pennsylvania or New Jersey, away from Headquarters.  \n15.  Mr. Hunt terminated Ms. Romak as part of this same reorganization \n(after passing over her for the Houston-based role), and her last day of employment \nwith Corporate Security at Shell USA Inc. was May 31, 2025. \n16.  On or about May 19, 2025, anticipating Ms. Romakโs departure, Mr. \nHunt bought and gifted Ms. Romak a โtear jar.โ \n \n17.  Mr.  Hunt  also  terminated  Mr.  Hutt  (White),  Ms.  Romak  and  Mr. \nTaylorโs Line Manager, in this reorganization. His last day of employment with \nCorporate Security at Shell USA Inc. was May 31, 2025. \n18.  On or about May 19, 2025, anticipating Mr. Huttโs departure, Mr. Hunt \nalso bought and gifted him another โtear jar.โ \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 5 of 40\n19.  A tear jar is a vessel designed to collect and save the tears of someone \nexperiencing  grief, and  here,  the  gift was intended  to  humiliate  and  mock two \nemployees who had just lost their jobs in a racially discriminatory reorganization. \nThis is evidence of conduct that is callous, willful and wanton . \n20.  Additional evidence of willful and wanton conduct includes Mr. Taylor \nasking for leave for bereavement on July 10, 2025, due to the death of his mother, \nand an hour or so later, Mr. Hunt sent out his Approval of Mr. Taylorโs transfer on \nan โexpeditedโ basis.   \n21.  Mr. Taylor had been seeking to avoid the transfer to Pennsylvania, and \nthe prospect of a forced transfer caused him great stress, which was increased by Mr. \nHuntโs callous actions. \nNAMED PARTIES \n22.  Plaintiff Romak is a Texas citizen whose primary residence is in Katy, \nTexas. \n23.  Plaintiff Taylor is a Texas citizen whose primary residence is in Sugar \nLand, Texas. \n24.  Defendant Shell PLC is a multinational energy company that maintains \nits Corporate Headquarters at Shell Centre, London, SE1 7NA, United Kingdom. \n25.  Defendant Shell PLC is incorporated in the United Kingdom with over \n500 employees. \n26.  Defendant Shell USA, Inc. (Shell USA) is a wholly owned United States \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 6 of 40\nsubsidiary of Shell PLC and maintains its United States Corporate Headquarters at \n150 North Dairy Ashford Road, TX 77079.  \n27.  Defendant  Shell  USA  is  incorporated  in  Delaware  with  over  500 \nemployees. \n28.  Defendant Hunt was and continues to serve as the Regional Security \nManager for Corporate Security at Shell, USA. Mr. Hunt, as the RSM, oversees the \nAmericas staff  who  are  to  ensure  the  security  of Shell's personnel,  assets,  and \noperations in the country for Shell, USA. \n29.  At all times relevant here, Mr. Hunt was the RSM who oversaw the \nreorganization in Corporate Security, managed it, and led the panel on the hiring \nand employment practices at issue, while at all relevant times, reporting to Mr. \nManning, Corporate Security Vice President, in the U.K. \n      JURISDICTION \n30.  This  Court  has  subject-matter  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1331 \nbecause the federal claims arise under the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e et seq., \nand the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. ยง1981.  \n31.

Venue is proper in this District under 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(f)(3) and 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(1)-(2) because the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred in \nthis judicial district and the employment records relevant to this dispute lie in this \njudicial district. This district is also where the Defendants maintain their principal \noffice in the United States. \n34.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง \n2000e et seq. and ยง 1988. \n35.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  relief  under  28  U.S.C.  ยงยง  2201,  2202  to \ninclude remediation. \nSHELLโS DIVERSITY EFFORTS \n36.  Shellโs website highlights โsome of the things weโre doingโ to shape the \nworkforce,  including  promotion,  hiring,  and  employment  practices  motivated  by \nindividualsโ immutable race and sex characteristics.1  \n37.  Shell  unabashedly  maintains  โpillars  and  aspirationsโ  to  hire  and \npromote individuals based on immutable characteristics. \n38.  Shell has established a โGlobal Council for Race,โ which seeks to ensure \nthat the race and sex-based makeup of its workforce โbetter reflects the communities \nin which [it] works.โ \n \n1 Shell.com/who-we-are/diversity-equity-and-inclusion.html#iframe=L2RlaS8= \n(May 28, 2025), https://perma.cc/2SXV-MEM9 \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 8 of 40\n39.  Shell also admits to maintaining โrace and ethnicity action plans.โ2 \n40.  Further, Shell admits and affirms that it knowingly and intentionally \nuses race, color, and sex as motivating factors in its employment practices in the Shell \nAnnual Report and Accounts for 2024.  \n41.  Shell uses extensive internal reporting to document progress towards its \ngoals, which include illegal racial quotas. \n42.  Shell maintains a Council supported by a global Employee Advisory \nBoard with employees from deliberately selected diverse backgrounds that โwas set \nup to ensure our race and ethnicity action plans are shaped by the voices and \nexperiences of colleagues at Shell.โ \n43.  Shell stated in its 2024 annual report that โthrough racial and ethnic \nrepresentation across our workforce, we aim to reflect the communities in which we \nwork.โ \n44.  Shell aims to maintain or exceed having at least one Board member from \nan ethnic minority background, while acknowledging that this may not be achieved \nin periods of Board change.  \n45.  As of December 31, 2024, the Board had three members who identify as \nbeing from an ethnic minority group and one EC member who identifies as being from \nan ethnic minority group. \n \n2 Shell.com/who-we-are/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/race-and-ethnicity.html (May 28, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/2YAX-P3MQ (emphasis added). \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 9 of 40\n46.  As of the end of 2024, 15% of Shellโs Senior Management identified as \nbeing from an ethnic minority group. \n47.  Shell further states, โShell aims to achieve 15% ethnic minority \ngroup representation in its Senior Management [B] by 2027.โ \n48.  Shellโs leadership is primarily based in the U.K. \n49.  As relevant background, Mr. Hunt and Mr. Manning served in the \nBritish Military together.  \n50.  Mr. Hunt, the RSM, reports to Mr. Manning in the U.K. \n51.  Shell has provided no training or education to Plaintiffs in Corporate \nSecurity at Shell USA, Inc., as employees based in the United States, to explain civil \nrights laws in the United States versus those of the U.K., and how race cannot be \nused as a motivating factor in employment practices in the United States. \nBACKGROUND \n \n52.  According to Shellโs policies, a reorganization at Shell USA must go \nthrough Human Resources. \n53.  Standard Procedure for the U.S. CS reorganization should have started \nwith offering the new regional positions to existing staff on the Corporate Security \nTeam. \n54.  Standard  procedures  include  the  application  of  an  โincumbent \npreference,โ which requires that Shell employees wishing to remain in their current \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 10 of 40\nroles be listed as the preferred candidate for that role. \n55.  During a standard reorganization, a current Shell employee must be \nselected for any role to which at least one Shell employee applied. This is known as \nthe โemployee preference.โ \n56.  In other words, if a current Shell employee and an outside candidate \napplied for the same role, the current Shell employee must be the preferred candidate. \n \nPlaintiffsโ Backgrounds \n57.  Before being hired by Shell PLC on September 21, 2009, Mr. Taylor had \nserved as a law enforcement officer and served as a law enforcement mentor in Iraq.  \n58.  In 2005, Mr. Taylor was sent back from Iraq to serve as the Quick \nReaction Force Security Team Lead to assist with emergency disaster relief during \nHurricane Katrina, helping save people from the flood.  \n59.  From there, Mr. Taylor served over four years in Security Services roles \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, first as a Senior Security Lead/Instructor and then as a \nManager in the Afghanistan Police Programโs Security Management Cell.  \n60.  From 2009 forward, Mr. Taylor worked for Shell as a Real Estate Asset \nProtection Manager responsible for all security aspects for the Shell Woodcreek Site \nat 150 N. Dairy Ashford, Houston, TX 77079. \n61.  During that time, Mr. Taylor was promoted (from a JG5 to a JG4) and \ncontinually given more responsibility due to his achievements, high performance, and \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 11 of 40\nawards. \n62.

As a Security Advisor for the United States, Mr. Taylor reported to Mr. \nHutt (the Country Security Manager), who reported to Mr. Hunt, the RSM. \n66.  In approximately 2024, Mr. Hunt, RSM, marked Mr. Taylorโs review \nslightly down from his line managerโs assessment after Mr. Taylor filed an internal \ncomplaint  against  Mr.  Hunt.  Even  with  this  retaliatory  reduction,  Mr.  Taylor \nretained a โstrongโ performance rating overall.  \n67.  Mr. Taylor continually met all deliverables and requirements, and his \nline managerโs review of Mr. Taylorโs performance remained โoutstanding.โ \n68.

While there, she received specialized 3-day \ncombat training and was certified as a member of the combat training team. \n72.  While in the Air Force, Ms. Romak also received an Airman Leadership \nTraining certification. \n73.  After leaving the Air Force, Ms. Romak was hired by Shell Energy \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 13 of 40\nResources (a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell PLC) on May 19, 2008. \n74.  Ms. Romak  worked  at  Shell  Pipeline as an HSSE System  Advisor, \nserving as the Security Focal Point for all the Midstream assets in the U.S.  \n75.  In this role, she developed the first MTSA-regulated Security Plan, \nwhich became the standard protocol in Security. \n76.  On August 1, 2022, Ms. Romak was transferred to Shell USA to serve as \na Security Advisor in U.S. CS. \n77.  In the Security Advisor role for the United States, Ms. Romak reported \nto Mr. Hutt (the CSM), who reported to the RSM, Mr. Hunt. \n78.  Prior to joining the Corporate Security team, Ms. Romakโs Certifications \nincluded: \nโข  Shell Auditing HSSE & SP Control Framework (5-day course) \nโข  Shell Causal Learning Investigator (5-day course) \nโข  Shell Incident Management โ Incident Command System 100, 200 \nand 300 \nโข  Smith System Defensive Driving  \nโข  Shell Contract Holder Training \nโข  Shell Management of Change โ Awareness, Knowledge and Skill \nโข  Shell Sphera Cloud Event Owner Training \nโข  Shell Basics of Financial Management (3-day course) \nโข  Shell Emergency Plans and Procedures \nโข  Shell Assist & Assure Leaders \nโข  Shell Coaching Model and Supporting Tools \nโข  Shell Contractor HSSE & SP Management Assessment \nโข  Shell Contractor Safety Management System \n \n79.  Shell has continued to invest in Ms. Romak as a Security Advisor at U.S. \nCS, where she had obtained the following Certifications and Trainings:  \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 14 of 40\nโ  Security Risk Assessment Methodology \nโ  Facility Security Officer (MTSA Regulated Facilities) \nโ  Water Survival / Helicopter Underwater Egress (HUET) \nโ  Texas DHS Infrastructure Liaison Course Certification \nโ  Hostile Environment Awareness Training with Advanced Counter-\nAmbush Driving Certification \nโ  Kidnap and Ransom Awareness Training \nโ  FBI Active Shooter Training  \n \n80.  During  her  17-year  career  with  Shell,  Ms.  Romak  performed \nexceptionally well. She was hired on as a full-time employee after initially serving as \na contractor, she was then promoted 3 times, including a double promotion, and was \ncontinually given more responsibility due to her achievements and high performance. \nMs.  Romak  received  11  special  recognition  awards  and  maintained  a  high-\nperformance rating with no write-ups or negative feedback during her time with \nShell. \n81.  Ms. Romak has consistently received โstrongโ or better performance \nreviews. \nโ  2024: Strong โ job grade 4 (Line Manager and Mr. Hunt evaluated as \nโHigher,โ but Mr. Manning (UK) reduced to โStrongโ) \nโ  2023: Strong โ job grade 4 (Line Manager evaluated as โHigher,โ but \nMr. Manning (UK) reduced to โStrongโ) \nโ  2022: Strong โ promoted to job grade 4  \n \nMR. HUNTโS DISCRIMINATORY REORGANIZATION \n82.  In October 2024, Mr. Hunt began planning a reorganization of the U.S. \nCS Team. \n83.  On January 1, 2025, Mr. Hunt, the RSM, brought Ms. Chevez over from \nthe Trading & Supply organization (another team inside Shell USA). Mr. Hunt \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 15 of 40\ncreated a new Security Advisor role within the US Corporate Security Team for Ms. \nChevez, which raised costs and increased the budgetary needs for U.S. CS. \n84.  Ms. Chevez had begun working with Shell, USA Inc. in approximately \nAugust 1997 through May of 2011 as a Shell Administrative Assistant (basic admin \nduties), upon information and belief, most likely in a starting pay grade. \n85.  From May 2011 through September 2021, she was promoted to Security \nAssurance  Analyst,  where  her  duties  included  administrative  tasks,  such  as \nuploading security risk assessments to SharePoint, booking meetings, and sending \nreminders. During this time, she had no physical security duties, nor was she trained \non them at even a basic level. Upon information and belief, from May 2011 through \nSeptember 2021, she was at a lower pay grade, Pay Grade 6.  \n86.  From October 2021 through January 1, 2025, Ms. Chevez worked as a \nSecurity  Advisor  for  Trading  and  Supply  within  Shell  USA,  Inc.  She  was  only \nresponsible for this one business unitโs assets, which were almost all terminals.  \n87.  While Ms. Chevez worked at Trading and Supply, Mr. Taylor trained \nMs. Chevez on security risk assessments and security plans. Before his training, Ms. \nChevez did not know how to do a security risk assessment. She had no executive \nprotection experience or event protection experience of any kind. \n88.  On or about January 1, 2025,  Mr. Hunt hired Ms. Chevez without \nnotifying Mr. Hutt, the line manager for the new role and the U.S. Country Security \nManager for Corporate Security at Shell, USA, Inc., violating Shell protocols. \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 16 of 40\n89.  On January 9, 2025, after onboarding Ms. Chevez, Mr. Hunt announced \nin an email that a reorganization was occurring.  \n90.  Ms. Chevez, a Hispanic female, came from a role in Trading & Security \n(TS), a different business line, which required different skills that did not directly \nmap into the new role.  \n91.  Upon information and belief, when Ms. Chevez first joined U.S.CS on \nJanuary 1, 2025, she was not asked to do a Written Assessment to join or apply for \nthe position.  \n92.  A discussion was never held with the U.S. CS Team about possibly \nrelocating for the new roles. Nor was Human Resources made available to Plaintiffs \nor others in US CS to respond to any questions about possible relocations. \n93.  The job postings indicated, โGrading decisions will also depend on other \nfactors,โ without providing any indication of what those might be. \n94.  In the call on January 9, Mr. Hunt, the RSM, told Plaintiffs that a \nโWritten Assessmentโ would be used to screen applicants.  \n95.  Upon information and belief, the RSM previously attempted to use a \nWritten Assessment, but U.S. HR prevented the use of written assessments because \nthey violated Shell policy. \n96.  Mr. Hunt had previously, in or about 2021 or 2022, replaced a Regional \nSecurity Advisor (JG2), previously held by a White American Male based in Houston, \nwith Mr. Colombo, a Latin American Male from Argentina.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 17 of 40\n97.  Before this reorganization, Mr. Hunt also had replaced the U.S. Intel \nAnalyst, a role previously held by a White American Male, with Ms. De los Rios, an \nIntel Analyst based in Mexico and a non-US Citizen. \n98.  On or about January 8, 2025, Mr. Taylor and Ms. Romak noticed that \nMr. Hunt repeatedly gave preferential treatment to employees of color and non-\nAmericans over White American employees. \n99.  For example, Mr. Hunt directed Mr. Colombo, the Regional Security \nAdvisor, to coach and prepare Ms. Chevez for the interview process.  \nโ  The first coaching session began on January 15th at 3 pm-4 pm. \nโ  The second coaching session was on January 22nd at 2-3 pm. \nโ  The third coaching session was on January 29th from 2 pm to 3 \npm. \nโ  The fourth coaching session was January 30th at 10 am-11 am \nโ  Fifth coaching session was February 6th at 11-11:30 am (Also day \nof 1st Initial Interview) \nโ  Sixth coaching session scheduled for February 12th at 2 pm-3 pm. \nโ  Seventh coaching session scheduled for February 19th at 2-3 pm. \nโ  Eight coaching sessions are scheduled for February 20th at 10 \nam-11 am. \nโ  Ninth coaching session scheduled for February 26th at 2 pm-3 \npm. \n \n100.  Neither Mr. Hunt, nor anyone else, offered Mr. Taylor or Ms. Romak \nequivalent coaching opportunities. \n101.  On January 23, 2025, Mr. Hunt told Mr. Taylor that he had to resubmit \nfor his current role because โothers had expressed interest in the role,โ and Shell \nโwas looking to diversify the talent.โ \n102.  Only the remaining White employees on the team, including Ms. Romak \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 18 of 40\nand Mr. Taylor, were required to reapply for their current roles and to select backup \nroles in other regions. \n103.  Ms. Chevez was instructed to apply only for the Houston-based Security \nAdvisor South role. \n104.  The other employees (all persons of color already in U.S.CS), were not \nrequired  to  reapply  for  their  current  roles  or  to  select  backups  in  the  RSMโs \nreorganization, including Ms. Chevez, Mr. Erazo, Ms. Olivarez, Mr. Colombo, and \nMs. De los Rios. \n105.  Before Mr. Hunt made his determinations on the reorganization, on \nJanuary  23,  2025,  Ms.  Romak  submitted  an  internal  complaint  alleging  policy \nviolations in the reorganization process, alleging that Mr. Hunt had engaged in an \nโEEOC violation,โ describing the process as โseem[ing] biased.โ \n106.  When this complaint was investigated, Mr. Taylor alleged that the RSM \n(Mr. Hunt) was racially discriminating under the guise of the reorganization. \n107.  On February 4, 2025, Mr. Taylor was sent a Teams message from Ms. \nOlivarez that stated, โJust a heads up, Wayne would like a DE&I presentation (20 \nMinutes) for our regional call.โ \n108.  On February 11, 2025, Ms. Chevez was allowed to take her written \nassessment from home, while Ms. Romak and Mr. Taylor were both required to take \ntheir assessments in the office. \n109.  While Ms. Chevez could take her written assessment without intrusion \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 19 of 40\nor interruption, Mr. Hunt interrupted on two occasions and glared at the computer \nscreens  of  Ms.  Romak  and  Mr.  Taylor  during  their  one-hour  in-office  written \nassessments, attempting to intimidate them and undermine their performance.  \n110.  Despite doing well on the written assessments in this difficult situation, \nboth were denied the Houston-based Security Advisor South role, which was given to \nMs. Chevez. \n111.  The RSM determined that the Line Manager, Hutt (White), whose title \nwas Country Security Manager, was to be replaced by a Black male, Mr. Jackson. \nMr. Jackson came from a Lagos, Nigeria, expatriate assignment in Business Integrity \nand lacked substantial experience in the security of persons and assets. \n112.  In Mr. Jacksonโs role in Lagos, he primarily investigated complaints of \nfraud,  rather  than  focusing  on  the  protection  of  physical  assets  and  company \nexecutives. \n113.  Mr. Hutt, a Shell employee for nearly fifteen (15) years who held the \nCountry Security Manager role for eight (8) years, should have been listed as a \npreferred candidate. He was not and was instead discharged on June 1, 2025.  \n114.  Others in the Corporate Security group, but of a different racial or \nethnic group, were not even required to resubmit for their positions in the alleged \nโreorganization,โ but all three White employees were required to do so.  \n115.  On February 18, 2025 Mr. Hunt conducted Ms. Romakโs interview for \nthe reorganization after work hours.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 20 of 40\n116.  On March 3, 2025, Ms. Romak received a letter stating she was not \nselected to continue in her role. \n117.  Also  on  March  3,  2025,  Ms.  Romak  received  notification  that  her \ninternal complaint had been denied. \n118.  On  the  same  day,  Mr.  Taylor  also  received  a  notification  that  his \ninternal complaint had been denied. \n119.  In the โreorganization,โ Mr. Hunt created new location-based positions \nfor U.S.CS, including a regional โSecurity Advisor Southโ position based in Houston, \na regional โSecurity Advisor Eastโ position based in Pennsylvania, and a regional \nโSecurity  Advisor  Westโ  position  based  in  California.  He  also  promoted  Ms. \nVelazquez to the Country Security Manager for Mexico.  \n120.  Until  this  โreorganization,โ  U.S.  CSโs central  headquarters were in \nHouston, and all employee U.S. Security Advisors were based there. \n121.  Mr. Taylor applied for โSecurity Advisor South,โ the Houston-based \nrole,  as  his  first  choice,  โSecurity  Advisor  Westโ  as  his  second-choice  job,  and \nโSecurity Advisor Eastโ as his third-choice job.  \n122.  Mr. Hunt chose Ms. Chevez, a Hispanic female who does not have Mr. \nTaylorโs certifications or qualifications, to fill the Security Advisor South role, which \nwas most equivalent to Mr. Taylorโs Houston pre-reorganization role.  \n123.  Indeed, since this decision was made, Mr. Taylor has repeatedly been \nasked to perform duties belonging to Ms. Chevez (like guarding the CEO when he \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 21 of 40\nwas in the region) because it was well known that she was not competent to fulfill \nthose duties. \n124.  Likewise, Mr. Taylor was passed over for the Security Advisor West role \nin favor of Ms. Velazquez, another less qualified Hispanic female.  \n125.  Ms. Velazquez,  a  Hispanic  female,  was announced  as the  โSecurity \nAdvisor Westโ on March 17, 2025. \n126.  Ms. Velazquez was not eligible to serve in this role, as she is not a U.S. \ncitizen and failed to meet even that most basic qualification. \n127.  Mr. Hunt, ultimately realizing this, on March 20, 2025, three days after \nnaming her Security Advisor West, announced that Ms. Velazquez would instead \nbecome Mexicoโs Country Security Manager. \n128.  Upon information and belief, when Ms. Velazquez was appointed to the \nMexico  Country  Security  Manager  role,  she  was  not  asked  to  do  a  Written \nAssessment to join or apply for the position. \n129.  On March 20, 2025, Mr. Hunt emailed the Corporate Security team to \nannounce the new positions: Ms. Chevez for South Security Advisor, Mr. Erazo for \nWest Security Advisor, Mr. Taylor for East Security Advisor, and Ms. Velazquez for \nCountry Security Manager (CSM) for Mexico.  \n130.  On March 26, Mr. Manning announced the three new Security Advisor \nRoles, and Ms. Romakโs and Mr. Huttโs departures to the entire organization. \n131.  Had Mr. Taylor been given the Security Advisor West position, Ms. \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 22 of 40\nRomak  would  have  been  placed  in  the  Security  Advisor  East  position  and  not \nterminated. \n132.  Mr.  Hunt  instead  announced  that  Mr.  Erazo  (a  Hispanic  male \ncontractor and non-Shell employee) would serve as the Security Advisor West. \n133.  In so doing, Mr. Hunt declined to apply โthe employee preference,โ \nwhich would have required him to select current Shell employees over contractors or \nexternal hires. \n134.  Mr. Hutt (Mr. Taylor and Ms. Romakโs former supervisor) stated that \nboth were more qualified than Erazo and had demonstrated superior performance. \n135.  Mr. Hunt also selected Erazo despite the fact that in December of 2024, \nMr. Hutt, then Country Security Manager, was preparing to terminate Mr. Erazoโs \ncontract for lack of performance. \n136.  However, despite this documented history of poor  performance and \ndespite his status as a mere contractor, Mr. Hunt placed Mr. Erazo in a job Mr. Taylor \napplied for, and for which Mr. Taylor was eminently more qualified. \n137.  Since taking on his role on August 19, 2025, Erazo has asked for Mr. \nTaylorโs  assistance  at  U.S.  CS,  explaining  that  he  has  never  done  a  Security \nAssessment or Security Plan for Executive Protection and has never even seen one. \n138.  Mr. Huntโs hiring of Erazo over existing Shell employees violated clear \nShell policy that allowed Mr. Hunt to hire an outside applicant only if no qualified \nShell employees applied for the position.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 23 of 40\n139.  This left Mr. Taylor in his third-choice role of Security Advisor East. \n140.  Ms. Romak had listed โSecurity Advisor Eastโ as her second-choice job \nin the reorganization. Mr. Taylor is senior to Ms. Romak, and he therefore got the \nSecurity Advisor East role. \n141.  Because the Defendants made employment decisions based on race, \ncolor, and national origin, Ms. Romak was not selected for any roles and Shell \ndischarged her on June 1, 2025. \n142.  On February 7, 2025, Mr. Hunt defended his disregard of the employee \nand incumbent preferences by stating that there were high levels of interest in the \npositions. \n143.  Shell policy does not authorize the elimination of the incumbent and \nemployee preferences due to high interest in the position. \n144.  The reorganizationโs outcome resulted in Ms. Chevez, a Hispanic, being \nselected for the South Security Advisor role.  \n145.  Ms. Velazquez, a Mexican national based in Mexico (Hispanic), was \nchosen for the West Security Advisor role but is now Country Security Manager in \nMexico for Shell Mexico.  \n146.  A Hispanic contractor, Mr. Erazo, is in the Security Advisory West role. \n147.  Mr.  Jackson  (Black)  has  replaced  Mr.  Hutt  (White)  as  Shell  USโs \ncountry security manager.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 24 of 40\nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. ยง1981 \n(Both Plaintiffs) \n \n148.  Plaintiffs repeat and reassert each and every allegation in paragraphs \nabove as if fully set forth herein at length. \n149.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in employment. \n150.  Defendants conspired and agreed to eliminate and deny employment \npositions to Mr. Taylor and Ms. Romak based on race, color, ethnicity, or national \norigin.  \n151.  Mr. Taylor was the most qualified to remain in Houston as Security \nAdvisor South but was denied that opportunity due to his race and national origin. \nHe was more qualified than Ms. Velasquez or Mr. Erazo for the Security Advisor \nWest position based in California, but was denied that opportunity due to his race, \ncolor, ethnicity and/or national origin. \n152.  Defendants, jointly and severally, knowingly and intentionally violated \nSection 1981 by demoting Mr. Taylor to Security Advisor East and forcing him to \nmove from Houston, Texas, to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, because of his \nrace, color, ethnicity and/or national origin.  \n153.  Defendants, jointly and severally, knowingly and intentionally violated \nSection 1981 by wrongfully denying Ms. Romak a position as Security Advisor East, \ndue to her race, color, ethnicity and/or national origin. \n154.  Defendants, jointly and severally, knowingly and intentionally violated \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 25 of 40\nSection 1981 by wrongfully discharging Ms. Romak as a Security Advisor in Houston, \nTexas, and terminating her from Shell, USA, Inc., because of her race, color, ethnicity \nand/or national origin.  \n155.  Defendants have acted with malice and/or reckless indifference to Mr. \nTaylorโs and Ms. Romakโs rights and thus have caused them to be damaged. \n \n \n \n \n \nCOUNT II \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e et seq. \nRace, Ethnicity, National Origin, and Color as Motivating Factors in \nEmployment Practices \nPlaintiff Taylor \n \n156.  Plaintiffs repeat and reassert each and every allegation in paragraphs \nabove as if fully set forth herein at length. \n157.  Mr. Taylor is a White male. \n158.  Mr. Taylor was better qualified for the positions for which he applied. \n159.  Despite being qualified for his firstโand second-choice positions, the \nDefendants, jointly and severally, including through Mr. Huntโs intentional actions, \nselected lesser-qualified and even unqualified people of color, including Ms. Chevez, \nMs. Velazquez, and Mr. Erazo, over Mr. Taylor because of his race, color, ethnicity \nand/or national origin.. \n160.  Further,  a  pattern  and  practice  of  discrimination  occurred  in \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 26 of 40\nDefendantsโ January 2025 reorganization, which resulted in the involuntary transfer \nof Mr. Taylor to a less desirable role.  \n161.  Mr. Hunt further expressly admitted that he was seeking to โdiversify \nthe talentโฆ,โ which, together with Shell's policies on DEI stated above, shows that \nthe Defendants jointly intentionally sought to promote people of color over White \npeople. \n162.  As a result of this discrimination, Mr. Taylor is being transferred and \ndemoted, while they denied Mr. Taylor a promotion to which he was entitled.  \n163.  It required him to relocate to Pennsylvania and did not promote him, \nwhereas the Defendants promoted Ms. Velazquez and are paying Mr. Erazo a higher \nrate under his contract.  \n164.  It further increases Mr. Taylorโs personal costs to live and work in \nPennsylvania compared to the Houston, Texas, area.  \n165.  Mr. Hunt approved this relocation to Pennsylvania on July 10, 2025, on \nan โexpeditedโ basis, mere hours after Mr. Taylor told Mr. Hunt that his mother had \ndied and requested bereavement leave. \n166.  Mr.  Taylorโs  required  transfer  to  Pennsylvania  constitutes  harm \ninflicted on Mr. Taylor. See Muldrow v. St. Louis, 601 U.S. 346, 355 (2024) (โMany \nforced transfers leave workers worse off respecting employment terms or conditions. \nAfter all, a transfer is not usually forced when it leaves the employee better off.โ) \n(cleaned up). \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 27 of 40\n167.  Mr. Taylor has complied with Title VIIโs charge filing provisions, 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 2000e-5(e)(1) and (f)(1). \n168.  Mr. Taylor filed a timely charge of discrimination against Shell with the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission.  \n169.  Mr. Taylor received a Determination and Notice of Rights letter from \nthe United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \n170.  Defendants were motivated by their desire to replace White employees \nin the U.S. CS with persons of color, and discriminated against Mr. Taylor concerning \nhis compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of his race, \ncolor, ethnicity and/or national origin.  \n171.  The Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit clearly state, โevaluating a \nperson  by  ancestry  instead  of  by  his  or  her  own  merit  reinforces  pernicious \nstereotypes and demeans the dignity and worth of the individual.โ Students for Fair \nAdmissions, Inc. v.

Plaintiff repeats and reasserts each allegation in the paragraphs above \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n176.  Ms. Romak is a White female. \n177.  Ms. Romak was better qualified for the positions for which she applied, \nhaving served in the United States Air Force, and having many certifications specific \nto the role. Ms. Chevez lacked these key certifications at the time of her hire into \nCorporate  Security  and  had  no  experience  in  Executive  Protection  or  Event \nProtection.  \n178.  Ms.  Romak,  despite  facing  materially  worse  circumstances,  did \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 29 of 40\nexcellently on her Written Assessment.  \n179.  Despite being significantly more qualified for the positions, Ms. Romak \nwas removed from her prior position and not selected for any of the positions for \nwhich she applied. This resulted in her termination from Shell. \n180.  Defendants, jointly, prioritized the hiring of people of color and ethnic \nminorities  over  White  employees,  constituting  both  evidence  of  intentional \ndiscrimination, and showing a Pattern and Practice of discrimination based on her \nrace, color, ethnicity and/or national origin.. \n181.  On January 23, 2025, Mr. Hunt told Mr. Taylor he sought to โdiversify \nthe team.โ \n182.  Shell offered no training to corporate security employees including Mr. \nHutt, Mr. Taylor, and Ms. Romak to explain civil rights laws in the United States \ncompared to those in the U.K.  \n183.  Shell leadership, including Mr. Manning, as shown in Shellโs Annual \nReport (2024), promotes race as a motivating factor in employment practices.  \n184.  On March 20, 2025, Mr. Hunt emailed the Corporate Security team to \nannounce the new positions: Ms. Chevez for South Security Advisor, Mr. Erazo for \nWest Security Advisor, Mr. Taylor for East Security Advisor, and Ms. Velazquez for \nCountry Security Manager (CSM) for Mexico.  \n185.  On March 26, 2025, Mr. Manning announced the three new Security \nAdvisor Roles and Ms. Romakโs and Mr. Huttโs departures to the entire organization. \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 30 of 40\n186.  Defendants  denied  Ms.  Romak  any  position,  giving  her  notice  of \nDischarge or Termination on the same day that Human Resources denied her early \nJanuary 2025 internal complaint, which cited to the EEOC and bias, reflecting \nretaliation in violation of Title VII, (described in the next count), in addition to her \ndiscrimination claims.  \n187.  Mr. Hunt gave her a Tear Jar as a gift before her departure. \n188.  A tear jar is a vessel designed to hold the tears of its owner, and the \nโgiftโ was intended to mock and belittle Ms. Romak, who had just been fired due to \nher race. The โgiftโ was clearly designed to add insult to the already inflicted injury. \n189.  Ms.  Romak  filed  a  timely  charge  of  discrimination  and  retaliation \nagainst Shell with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, complying with \nTitle VIIโs charge filing provisions, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000e-5(e)(1) and (f)(1).  \n190.  Ms. Romak received a Determination and Notice of Rights letter from \nthe United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (a right to sue letter) \n[See Exhibit 1] and (tolling agreement respectively) [See Exhibit 2].  \n191.  Shell, motivated by its desire to replace White employees in the USCS \nTeam with โdiverseโ employees, discriminated against Ms. Romak concerning her \ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of her her race, \ncolor, ethnicity and/or national origin.  \nCOUNT IV \nRetaliation \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-3 \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 31 of 40\nPlaintiff Romak \n192.

On January 23, 2025, Ms. Romak submitted an internal complaint \nalleging policy violations in the reorganization process and alleging that Mr. Hunt \nhad engaged in racial discrimination. \n194.

On  the  same  day,  March  3,  2025,  Ms. Romak  was  also  personally \nnotified that her internal complaint had been denied.  \n198.  Defendants retaliated against Ms. Romak because she reported Mr. \nHuntโs  unlawful  discriminatory  practices,  thereby  adversely  affecting  her \nemployment. \n199.

Defendant  Shell  USA,  Inc.,  is  a  federal  contractor  subject  to  the \nrequirements of VEVRAA. \n212.  Upon information and belief, Shell has entered and is actively working \nunder  one  or  more  contracts  with  the  federal  government  exceeding  $100,000, \nthereby  triggering  VEVRAAโs  requirement  that  federal  contractors  engage  in \n33 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 34 of 40\naffirmative action and nondiscrimination in the employment of covered veterans. \n213.  As a federal contractor subject to VEVRAA, Shell is legally obligated to \nengage  in  affirmative  recruitment,  retention,  promotion,  and  nondiscrimination \npractices toward qualified veterans such as Ms. Romak. This includes the obligation \nto maintain a written affirmative action plan for veterans, regularly track veteran \nemployment and application data, provide transparency in selection and promotion \ncriteria, and ensure that veterans are not disadvantaged in employment decisions. \n214.  Ms. Romak is a veteran of the United States Air Force, having served \nhonorably in active-duty military service during the Gulf War.  \n215.  Ms. Romak is therefore a โcovered veteranโ under VEVRAA. \n216.  Accordingly, at all relevant times, she was a member of a class protected \nby the Vietnam Era Veteransโ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (โVEVRAAโ), 38 \nU.S.C. ยง 4212, as amended. Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veteransโ Readjustment \nAssistance Act (VEVRAA), Pub. L., No. 93โ508, 88 Stat. 1578 (1974). \n217.  Under VEVRAA any contract in the amount of $100,000 or more entered \ninto by any department or agency of the United States for the procurement of \npersonal property and nonpersonal services (including construction) for the United \nStates, shall contain a provision requiring that the party contracting with the United \nStates  take  affirmative  action  to  employ  and  advance  in  employment  qualified \ncovered veterans. This section applies to any subcontract in the amount of $100,000 \nor more entered into by a prime contractor in carrying out any such contract.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 35 of 40\n218.  Defendants therefore violated Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veteransโ \nReadjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), Pub. L., No. 93โ508, 88 Stat. 1578 (1974) \nand Exec. Order No. 14173, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, 2025) by failing to give Ms. \nRomak her statutory rights and protections during the reorganization process. \n219.  Further, 8 U.S. Code ยง 4212 mandates that if any veteran covered by \nthe first sentence of subsection (a) believes any contractor of the United States has \nfailed to comply or refuses to comply with the provisions of the contractorโs contract \nrelating to the employment of veterans, the veteran may file a complaint with the \nSecretary  of  Labor,  who  shall  promptly  investigate  such  complaint  and  take \nappropriate action in accordance with the terms of the contract and applicable laws \nand regulations. \n220.  Ms. Romak was employed by Shell for 17 years and had held the position \nof Security Advisor U.S. within the Corporate Security Division since August 1, 2022. \nShe was uniquely credentialed, having extensive experience in field operations, site \nsecurity, and offshore deployment protocols. She was also Shellโs only female military \nveteran in the Corporate Security Division at the time of the 2025 reorganization. \n221.  During her employment with Shell, Ms. Romak was fully qualified for \nher position and consistently met or exceeded performance expectations. She served \nas  a  Security  Advisor  U.S.  and  maintained  performance  required,  credentials, \ncertifications, and field experience. \n222.  Ms.  Romakโs  military  background  contributed  directly  to  her \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 36 of 40\nprofessional success at Shell. In fact, her evaluations reflected consistent competency \nand commitment. No prior disciplinary action or performance deficiency was ever \ndocumented \n223.  In early 2025, Shell initiated a purported โreorganizationโ of its U.S. \nCorporate Security team. As part of this reorganization, Shell selectively forced \ncertain employees including Ms. Romak and other White American employees to \nreapply for their own positions, while exempting others, primarily non-White, non-\nveteran individuals, from this requirement. \n224.  However, despite her superior qualifications, experience, and tenure, \nMs. Romak was involuntarily removed from her position, and Shell subsequently \nfilled her role with an individual who was neither a veteran nor comparably qualified \nunder Shellโs own standards. \n225.  Also, Ms. Romak was required to reinterview for her own position. The \nselection process lacked transparency, abandoning its internal preference policies, \nincluding both โincumbent preferenceโ and โemployee preference,โ which previously \nguaranteed a legitimate opportunity for retention. The reorganization also failed to \nprovide the โveteranโs preferenceโ required by VEVRAA. \n226.  Despite being fully qualified and tenured, Ms. Romak was stripped of \nher role and compelled to reinterview alongside candidates with significantly less \nexperience.  \n227.  The outcome of this process was  preordained, and Ms. Romak was \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 37 of 40\nremoved from her role and ultimately eliminated from Shellโs U.S. security operation.  \n228.  In effect, her position or its substantial equivalent was reassigned to a \nnon-veteran, who lacked comparable experience and who had not been required to \ncompete under the same process. That individual had been โcoachedโ into technical \neligibility  and  was  internally  advanced  without  documentation  of  performance \nsuperiority. \n229.  Shell provided no written explanation for Ms. Romakโs removal. She \nreceived no comparative data and no ranking.  \n230.  Additionally,  at  no  point  was  her  military  status  acknowledged, \nfactored, or afforded protection. Also, at no point was she notified of her rights as a \nveteran, either under internal policy or federal law. \n231.  Ms. Romak filed an internal EEO complaint, raising concerns about the \ndiscriminatory application of the reorganization. Less than forty days later, she was \nofficially  informed  that  she  would  not  be  reassigned,  offered  an  alternative \nplacement, or retained in any capacity. That termination followed directly on the \nheels of protected activity. \n232.  Shellโs treatment of Plaintiff, Ms. Romak was not only unlawful under \nTitle VII and Section 1981, but also constituted a violation of VEVRAA, in that Shell \nwillfully  failed:  (1)  to  apply  its  selection  criteria  in  a  nondiscriminatory  and \nconsistent manner; (2) to give preference to a qualified protected veteran, as required \nunder VEVRAA regulations; (3) to properly notify Ms. Romak of her rights as a \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 38 of 40\nveteran under federal contractor obligations; (4) retaliated against Ms. Romak for \nengaging in protected activity concerning discriminatory employment practices. \n233.  Shellโs conduct constitutes a knowing and willful violation of federal \nlaw. Its removal  of Ms. Romak  from  employment,  without  consideration of her \nqualifications,  tenure,  or  military  service,  and  under  a  selectively  applied  and \npretextual restructuring, and is actionable under VEVRAA. \n234.  As such and as a direct and proximate result of Defendantโs conduct, \nMs. Romak has suffered substantial damages, including lost income, lost benefits, \nloss  of  career  progression,  emotional  distress,  reputational  harm,  and  related \nconsequential losses. \n235.  Furthermore, Shellโs actions were willful, knowing, and undertaken \nwith disregard for its obligations under federal law with respect to veteran employees \nand  Shellโs  failure  to  comply  with  VEVRAAโs  affirmative  action  and \nnondiscrimination mandates constitutes a per se violation of 38 U.S.C. ยง 4212(b) and \n41 C.F.R. ยงยง 60-300.45 through 60-300.66. \n236.  Thus, upon information and belief, Shell failed to comply with each of \nthe above-listed requirements. It failed to maintain or apply any veteran-specific \nretention protocols. It failed to document or consider Ms. Romakโs veteran status in \nits restructuring process. And it failed to follow any affirmative action plan in effect \nduring the events in question. \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:25-cv-04042     Document 1     Filed on 08/26/25 in TXSD     Page 39 of 40\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Mr.  Kevin  Taylor  and  Ms.  Michelle  Romak  respectfully \nrequest that this Court enter judgment in their favor and against Defendant Shell, \nUSA, Inc. and Defendant Wayne Hunt, and provide the following relief: \nA.
