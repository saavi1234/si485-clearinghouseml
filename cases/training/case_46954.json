Following this request, University of Michigan Health-West officials allegedly summoned Plaintiff to a meeting, during which they denigrated her religious beliefs, called her &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and a &ldquo;liar,&rdquo; mockingly told her that she could not take the Bible or her religious beliefs to work with her, and blamed her for gender dysphoria-related suicides. &nbsp;Defendants fired her on August 24, 2021.&nbsp;</p>",

JANE M. BECKERING \nMETROPOLITAN HOSPITAL, et al.,   \n \n  Defendants. \n____________________________/ \n \n \nOPINION AND ORDER \n  Pending before the Court in this employment discrimination action is Defendantsโ โMotion \nfor Summary Judgment to Compel Arbitrationโ (ECF No. 73).  Plaintiff filed a response in \nopposition to Defendantsโ motion (ECF No. 76), and Defendants filed a reply (ECF No. 77).  For \nthe following reasons, the Court grants Defendantsโ motion and closes this case.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Pertinent Factual Background \n  Plaintiff Valerie Kloosterman began working as a physician assistant at Metro Health \nHospital in 2004 (2d Am. Compl. [ECF No. 69] ยถ 1).  In 2009, she and Metro Health Hospital \nentered into a Physician Assistant Employment Agreement (โEmployment Agreementโ) with an \ninitial term from December 1, 2009 to June 30, 2011, which would automatically renew for \nadditional one-year periods unless either party gave written notice of their intention not to renew \n(Employment Agreement, Defs. Ex. A [ECF No. 74-1] ยถ 8).  In Paragraph 28 of the Employment \nAgreement, the parties agreed to arbitrate as follows: \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1584   Filed 04/05/24   Page 2 of 22\nAny controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or \nthe breach thereof, shall be settled in accordance with the then existing rules of the \nAmerican Arbitration Association and judgment on the award rendered by the \narbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The fees and \nexpenses for such arbitration shall be paid equally by the Hospital and Physician \nAssistant. \n \n(id. ยถ 28).   \nThe Employment Agreement stated that it โshall be enforceable only by the parties hereto \nand their successors in interest by virtue of an assignment which is not prohibited under the terms \nof this Agreement,โ and that โno other person shall have the right to enforce any of the provisions \ncontained hereinโ (id. ยถ 23).  But the parties also agreed that the โHospital may, in its discretion, \nassign this Agreement as the Hospital deems necessary for future developmentโ (id. ยถ 25).  The \nEmployment Agreement contained a governing law provision stating that it โshall be governed by, \nconstrued and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Michiganโ (id. ยถ 20).  \nIn February of 2016, Plaintiff and Metro Health Hospital executed โAmendment #1โ to the \nEmployment Agreement, which, in relevant part, increased Plaintiffโs annual salary and incentive \nbonus compensation model (Amendment #1, Pl. Ex. B [ECF No. 76-3]).  Amendment #1 stated \nthat โ[a]ll other terms and conditions of the Physician Assistantโs Employment Agreement shall \nremain in full force and effectโ (id. at PageID.1534).   \nEffective July 1, 2021, Plaintiff and the hospital, then identified as Metro Health-University \nof Michigan Health, agreed to another amendment (โAmendment #2โ) of the โpreviously entered \nintoโ Employment Agreement (Amendment #2, Pl. Ex. C [ECF No. 76-4]).1   Amendment #2 \n \n1 Plaintiff provided the Court with a copy of Amendment #2 that does not include a signature by \nan agent of the hospital; however, Plaintiff does not claim that the hospital failed to sign the \namendment.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1585   Filed 04/05/24   Page 3 of 22\naddressed various revisions to the Employment Agreement and stated that โ[a]ll other terms and \nconditions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effectโ (id. at PageID.1537). \n  On August 24, 2021, Plaintiff was given an envelope containing her termination notice, \nwith an effective termination date of November 22, 2021 (2d Am. Compl. ยถ 103).   \nB.  Procedural Posture \nOn October 11, 2022, Plaintiff initiated this case, naming six Defendants and alleging nine \nclaims (ECF No. 1).  Specifically, Plaintiff named Metropolitan Hospital, d/b/a University of \nMichigan HealthโWest (UMHW), d/b/a Metro HealthโUniversity of Michigan Health; and five \nindividuals (collectively โthe Individual Defendantsโ) who were employees at UMHW in the \nfollowing positions:  Rakesh Pai, President and the Medical Group & Chief Population Health \nOfficer; Rhae-Ann Booker, Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Marla Cole, \nDirector  of  Human  Resources;  Thomas  Pierce,  Diversity,  Equity  &  Inclusion  Program \nCoordinator; and Catherine Smith, Nurse Practitioner and a member of the Advanced Practice \nProvidersโ  Council  (Compl.  [ECF  No.  1]  ยถยถ  21โ29).    On  January  9,  2023,  the  Individual \nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim (ECF No. 14, amended by ECF \nNo. 23), as did Defendant UMHW (ECF No. 16).  On January 23, 2023, Defendants collectively \nfiled a motion to stay discovery until the motions to dismiss were decided by the Court (ECF No. \n26).   \nPlaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on January 30, 2023 (ECF No. 30), which was \ncorrected the next day (ECF No. 32).  Because of this filing, the Court dismissed Defendantsโ \npending motions to dismiss and for a stay as moot (ECF No. 33).  On February 20, 2023, the \nIndividual Defendants and UMHW filed another set of motions to dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim (ECF Nos. 34 & 36, respectively).  On February 22, 2023, Defendants refiled their collective \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1586   Filed 04/05/24   Page 4 of 22\nmotion for a protective order to stay discovery pending resolution of their motions to dismiss (ECF \nNo. 38).  In their certificate of concurrence, Defendants stated that Plaintiffโs counsel did not \noppose a stay of discovery (ECF No. 40).  In March 2023, this Court entered an Order granting \nDefendantsโ motion to stay discovery (ECF No. 43).  In May 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for \nleave to amend/correct the Corrected First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 50), followed by a \ncorrected motion (ECF No. 51).   \nAfter the Partiesโ motions were fully briefed, the Court issued a 43-page Opinion and Order \nin September 2023 that granted in part and denied in part Defendantsโ motions to dismiss and \ngranted in part Plaintiffโs motion for leave to amend (ECF No. 68).  Plaintiff filed her Second \nAmended Complaint on October 11, 2023 (ECF No. 69) alleging four claims as follows: \nI.   Defendants Pai, Booker, Cole, Pierce, and Smith, in Both Their Official and Individual \nCapacitiesโViolation  of  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments:    Free  Exercise  of \nReligion, 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 \n \nII.  Defendants Pai, Booker, Cole, Pierce, and Smith, in Both Their Official and Individual \nCapacitiesโViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment:  Equal Protection, 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983 \n \nIII.  Defendant  Metropolitan  Hospital,  d/b/a  University  of  Michigan  Health-Westโ\nViolation of Title VII:  Religious Discrimination, Disparate Treatment, 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983 \n \nIV.  Defendants Pai, Booker, Cole, Pierce, and Smith, in their Individual Capacitiesโ\nViolation of the Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1974 \n \n(2d Am. Compl. at PageID.1264, 1271, 1273, 1277).  Defendants collectively filed an Answer on \nOctober 25, 2023 (ECF No. 71).  In  answer to Paragraphs 14, 15, and 17 of the Second Amended \nComplaint, Defendants averred that the action is subject to arbitration, and in Paragraph 2 of their \naffirmative defenses, Defendants claimed that the โCourt lacks jurisdiction and otherwise lacks \nauthority because Plaintiffโs claims are barred by the arbitration clause in the Employment \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1587   Filed 04/05/24   Page 5 of 22\nAgreement and Defendants intend to seek dismissal based upon sameโ (ECF No. 71).  On October \n27, 2023, this Court entered an Order setting a Rule 16 scheduling conference (ECF No. 72).   \nOn November 2, 2023, Defendants filed this motion for summary judgment to compel \narbitration (ECF No. 73), which Plaintiff opposes (ECF No. 76).  Plaintiff also subsequently filed \na Notice of Supplemental Authority (ECF No. 78), bringing this Courtโs attention to the decision \nof the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Schwebke v. United Wholesale Mortg. LLC, No. 23-1507, \n___ F.4th ___, 2024 WL 1298149 (6th Cir. Mar. 27, 2024).  Having considered the partiesโ \nsubmissions, the Court concludes that oral argument is unnecessary to resolve the issues presented.  \nSee W.D. Mich. LCivR 7.2(d).    \nII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Motion Standard \nIf, as here, the court considers evidence outside the complaint in resolving a motion to \ncompel arbitration, then it applies the summary judgment standard relevant to motions filed under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.  Boykin v. Fam. Dollar Stores of Michigan, LLC, 3 F.4th 832, \n838 (6th Cir. 2021); Rowan v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc., No. 13-1261, 2015 \nWL  9906264,  at  *1 (W.D. Mich. June 1, 2015), affโd, 647 F. Appโx 607 (6th Cir. 2016).  In \nconsidering a Rule 56 motion, the Court construes all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the \nnonmoving party.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  \nThe central issue is โwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission \nto a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.โ  Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251โ52 (1986).  The party opposing arbitration โbears the burden \nof establishing that the dispute is nonarbitrable,โ Rex v. CSA-Credit Sols. of Am., Inc., 507 F. Supp. \n2d 788, 793 (W.D. Mich. 2007) (citing Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 91 \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1588   Filed 04/05/24   Page 6 of 22\n(2000)), and โmust show a genuine issue of material fact as to the validity of the agreement to \narbitrate.โ  Great Earth Cos., Inc. v. Simons, 288 F.3d 878, 889 (6th Cir. 2002) (further noting \nthat โ[t]he required showing mirrors that required to withstand summary judgment in a civil suitโ).  \n \nB.  Discussion \n  In their briefs, the parties cite to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and federal caselaw in \nsupport of their respective arguments.  As already noted, the Employment Agreement contains a \ngoverning law provision that states the agreement โshall be governed by, construed and enforced \nin accordance with the laws of the State of Michiganโ (Employment Agreement ยถ 20).  The FAA \nis not mentioned in the Employment Agreement or either of its amendments.  โAlthough the FAA \ngenerally preempts inconsistent state laws and governs all aspects of arbitrations concerning \nโtransaction[s] involving commerce,โ parties may agree to abide by state rules of arbitration, and \nโenforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of \nthe FAA.โโ  Savers Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Natโl Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, PA, 748 F.3d \n708, 715โ16 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Muskegon Cent. Dispatch 911 v. Tiburon, Inc., 462 F. Appโx \n517, 522โ23 (6th Cir. 2012)).  Accordingly, Michigan law applies with respect to the interpretation \nand applicability of the arbitration clause in the present dispute.2 \nThe Court notes that federal law is mostly consistent with Michigan law on the presenting \nissues, and in fact, it directs the Court to apply state contract law to determine whether nonparties \n \n2 The arbitration clause in the Employment Agreement states that โany controversy, dispute or \nclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled in \naccordance with the then existing rules of the American Arbitration Association.โ  Thus, while \nMichigan law applies to the interpretation of the Employment Agreement and determination \nwhether Plaintiffโs claims against Defendants are subject to arbitration, the American Arbitration \nAssociation (AAA) rules would govern the arbitration itself.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1589   Filed 04/05/24   Page 7 of 22\nhave a right to compel arbitration under an existing agreement.  Moreover, Michigan has adopted \nthe Uniform Arbitration Act, MICH. COMP. LAWS ยง 600.1683 et seq., which is largely based on the \nFAA.  Given the similarities between federal and state law, the Court has considered the partiesโ \ncited cases applying the FAA where Michigan law is consistent with those cases or lacks sufficient \nanalysis on an issue. \nThe question of arbitrability is for the Court.  Kaleva-Norman-Dickson Sch. Dist. No. 6 v. \nKaleva-Norman-Dickson-Sch. Teachersโ Assโn, 227 N.W.2d 500, 587 (Mich. 1975).  โArbitration \nis a matter of contract.  A party cannot be required to arbitrate an issue which he has not agreed to \nsubmit to arbitration.โ  Id.  When interpreting an arbitration agreement, the court applies the same \nlegal principles that govern contract interpretation.  Altobelli v. Hartmann, 884 N.W.2d 537, 542 \n(Mich. 2016).  A courtโs โprimary task is to ascertain the intent of the parties at the time they \nentered into the agreement,โ which is determined โby examining the language of the agreement \naccording to its plain and ordinary meaning.โ  Id.  The general policy in Michigan is favorable to \narbitration, and โthe burden is on the party seeking to avoid the agreement, not the party seeking \nto enforce the agreement.โ  Id.    \nIn its motion for summary judgment to compel arbitration, Defendants argue that Plaintiffโs \nclaims against UMHW and the Individual Defendants are covered by the arbitration clause in the \nEmployment Agreement (ECF No. 74 at PageID.1464).  Plaintiff raises several arguments in \nopposition to arbitration, claiming that Defendants waived the opportunity to seek arbitration, the \ncurrent hospital entity is not covered by the arbitration clause, the Individual Defendants are not \ncovered by the arbitration clause, her claims are not subject to the arbitration clause, and there is a \nstrong public interest in keeping her employment discrimination and constitutional rights claims \nin a court of law (ECF No. 76).  In reply, Defendants contest that they waived their right to \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1590   Filed 04/05/24   Page 8 of 22\narbitration or that any of Plaintiffโs other objections have merit.  The Court will address the partiesโ \nvarious arguments in turn. \n \n1.  Employment Agreement Validity \nAs an initial matter, although Plaintiff does not claim that the Employment Agreement or \neither of its amendments are invalid due to fraud, duress, unconscionability, or other traditional \ndefenses to a contract, she contends that when she signed the documents, she did not have union \nrepresentation,  consult  an  attorney,  or  have  an  opportunity  to  negotiate  (ECF  No.  76  at \nPageID.1489; Kloosterman Decl. [ECF No. 76-1] ยถยถ 8โ10, 12โ14).  โA mere judicial assessment \nof โreasonablenessโ is an invalid basis upon which to refuse to enforce contractual provisions.  \nOnly  recognized  traditional  contract  defenses  [e.g.  duress,  waiver,  estoppel,  fraud  or \nunconscionability] may be used to avoid the enforcementโ of a contractual provision.  Rory v. \nContinental Ins. Co., 703 N.W.2d 23, 31 n.23 (Mich. 2005).  Plaintiff has identified no legally \nrecognized equitable defenses that would entitle her to invalidate the Employment Agreement and \nits arbitration clause.   \nEven if the FAA were applicable here, Defendants would not be entitled to invalidate the \nEmployment Agreement and its arbitration clause.  The FAA provides that โa contract evidencing \na transaction involving commerce,โ which provides for settlement by arbitration of disputes arising \nout of such contract or transaction, โshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon grounds \nas exist at law or in equity for the revocation of contract or as otherwise provided in chapter 4.โ  9 \nU.S.C. ยง 2.  The Supreme Court has clarified that the FAA applies to virtually all contracts of \nemployment, and that only transportation workers are exempted from the FAA.  Circuit City \nShores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105 (2001).  Moreover, โmere inequality in bargaining power . . . \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1591   Filed 04/05/24   Page 9 of 22\nis  not  a  sufficient  reason  to  hold  that  arbitration  agreements  are  never  enforceable  in  the \nemployment context.โ  Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 33 (1991).  โ[T]he \nFAAโs purpose was to place arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts.โ  Id.   \n  2. Waiver of Arbitration \n  Plaintiff contends that because Defendants engaged in more than a year of litigation and \nfiling โtwo sets of motions to dismiss, reply briefs in support of the motions, a motion to stay \ndiscovery,  vigorous  opposition  to  [Plaintiffโs]  motion  to  amend  her  complaint  (including \nopposition to [Plaintiffโs] motion to file a reply), participating in a FED. R. CIV. P. 26(f) conference, \nnegotiating and completing a joint status report in preparation for discovery, and filing an answer,โ \nDefendants have waived the opportunity to seek arbitration (ECF No. 76 at PageID.1491).  \nDefendants point out in reply that even Plaintiff admits that neither party has conducted discovery.  \nMoreover, the parties โhave also not participated in a scheduling conference, been subject to a \npretrial conference order, litigated this matter through the motion practice stages, issued any \nsubpoenas, deposed any witnesses, or appealed any adverse ruling.  And Defendants did not fail \nto raise arbitration as an affirmative defenseโ (ECF No. 77 at PageID.1553) (emphasis in original).  \nDefendants argue that based on the totality of the circumstances, they have not waived their right \nto arbitrate (id.). \n  Defendantsโ argument has merit. \n  โGenerally, courts disfavor the waiver of a contractual right to arbitration.  However, a \nparty may waive any contractual rights, including the right to arbitration.โ  Nexteer Automotive \nCorp. v. Mando America Corp, 886 N.W.2d 906, 909 (Mich. Ct. App. 2016).  โA waiver is an \nintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.โ  Id.  โWhether one has waived his \nright to arbitration depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case.โ  Madison Dist. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1592   Filed 04/05/24   Page 10 of 22\nPublic Schools v. Myers, 637 N.W.2d 526, 529 (Mich. Ct. App. 2001).  โThe party arguing there \nhas been a waiver of this right bears a heavy burden of proof and must demonstrate knowledge of \nan existing right to compel arbitration, acts inconsistent with the right to arbitrate, and prejudice \nresulting from the inconsistent acts.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  In light \nof the evolving law associated with arbitration agreements and matters of waiver, as revealed in \nMorgan v. Sundance, Inc., 596 U.S. 411 (2022), and its progeny,3 and because Plaintiff has not \nmet her heavy burden of proof in showing acts sufficiently inconsistent with the right to arbitrate \nto establish waiver, the Court need not address whether Plaintiff has also shown prejudice. \nAs Defendants point out, although time has passed due to litigation over Defendantsโ \nmotions to dismiss and Plaintiffโs multitude of amendments to her complaint, this case remains at \na relatively early stage.  No scheduling conference has been held.  No written discovery has taken \nplace, nor have any depositions been taken.  Defendants moved for a stay of discovery while their \nmotions to dismiss were pending, which Plaintiff did not oppose.  In their collective Answer to \nPlaintiffโs Second Amended Complaint, Defendants stated in answer to Paragraphs 14, 15, and 17 \nand in Paragraph 2 of their affirmative defenses that Plaintiffโs claims are barred by the arbitration \n \n3 Until recently, federal courts, including the Sixth Circuit, held that a party waives its right to \narbitration if it knew of the right, acted inconsistently with that right, and prejudiced the other party \nby its inconsistent actions.  Morgan, 596 U.S. at 413; Schwebke, 2024 WL 1298149, at *4.  In \nMorgan, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that the FAAโs policy favoring arbitration supports \nthe application of an arbitration-specific waiver rule demanding a showing of prejudice.  Morgan, \n596 U.S. at 416.  Noting that โ[o]utside the arbitration context, a federal court assessing waiver \ndoes not generally ask about prejudice,โ the Supreme Court held that the proper focus is on the \nactions of the person who held the right, not the effects of those actions on the opposing party, as \nwaiver โis the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.โ  Id. at 417 (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  The Supreme Court held that its frequent reference to the \nFAA as a โpolicy favoring arbitrationโ is โmerely an acknowledgment of the FAAโs commitment \nto overrule the judiciaryโs longstanding refusal to enforce arbitration agreements to arbitrate and \nto place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.โ  Id. at 418 (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).   \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1593   Filed 04/05/24   Page 11 of 22\nclause and that they intended to seek dismissal (ECF No. 71).  And within days of filing their \nAnswer, Defendants filed the pending motion to compel arbitration, prompting the Court to \nadjourn the Rule 16 scheduling conference and render moot the deadline to file a joint status report \n(ECF No. 75).  The Court finds that based on the totality of the circumstances, and unlike the \ndefendant in Schwebke, 2024 WL 1298149, or the multitude of other cases cited by Plaintiff, \nDefendants have not implicitly waived their contractual right to seek enforcement of the arbitration \nagreement,  as  their  conduct  did  not  rise  to  the  level  of  an  intentional  relinquishment  or \nabandonment of a known right.   \n3.  Right of University of Michigan HealthโWest to Enforce Arbitration Agreement  \n   Plaintiff argues that the Court should reject Defendantsโ attempt to compel arbitration of \nher claims against UMWH because the contract she signed in 2009 was with a different entity, \nMetropolitan  Health  Hospital,  โnearly  a  decade  before  it  was  purchased  by  University  of \nMichiganโ (ECF No. 76 at PageID.1504).  Defendants argue that Plaintiff remains bound by her \nEmployment Agreement because she signed an amendment effective on July 1, 2021 with โMetro \nHealth University of Michigan Health,โ which โamends the Employment Agreement previously \nentered into by the Partiesโ (ECF No. 77 at PageID.1561โ62 (quoting ECF 76-4 at PageID.1537)).   \n  Defendantsโ argument has merit. \n  In the Employment Agreement signed in 2009, the hospital was identified as Metro Health \nHospital (ECF No. 76-2).  However, in Paragraph 23 of the contract, it stated that โ[t]his agreement \nshall be enforceable only by the parties hereto and their successors in interest by virtue of an \nassignment which is not prohibited under the terms of this Agreement . . . โ and in Paragraph 25, \nit stated that โ[t]he Hospital may, in its discretion, assign this Agreement as the Hospital deems \nnecessary for future developmentโ  (id. at PageID.1528).  In other words, an assignment of the \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1594   Filed 04/05/24   Page 12 of 22\nEmployment Agreement by the hospital was anticipated as possible and expressly permitted at the \ntime Plaintiff signed it.  Moreover, as Defendants point out, Plaintiff signed Amendment #2 to the \nEmployment Agreement in 2021, in which the hospital was expressly identified as โMetro Health-\nUniversity of Michigan Health.โ  In Amendment #2, the parties agreed that it was an amendment \nto  the  Employment  Agreement  previously  entered  into  by  the  parties  (ECF  No.  76-4  at \nPageID.1537).  Plaintiff cannot escape applicability of the arbitration agreement as it pertains to \nthe current hospital entity.   \n4.  Right of Individual Defendants to Enforce Arbitration Agreement \n  Next, Plaintiff argues that the Individual Defendants have no right to compel arbitration \nbecause they were not parties to the contract, none of them were employed by Metropolitan \nHospital when she signed the contract in 2009, and she did not agree to arbitrate claims for \nconstitutional violations by any future employee acting in their individual capacity (ECF No. 76 \nat PageID.1509).  She further argues that when signing the Employment Agreement, she could not \nhave foreseen that individual actors whom she had not yet met would take actions toward her \npersonally that would violate her constitutional rights under ยง1983, that constitutional claims under \nยง1983 can only be brought against a state actor, and that she could not possibly have agreed to \nsend her constitutional claims under ยง1983 to arbitration because Metro Health did not become a \nstate actor until the University of Michigan took over its operations in 2016 (id.)   \n  The only cases Defendants cite in support of their argument that the Individual Defendants \nare entitled to compel arbitration are Arnold v. Arnold Corp., 920 F.2d. 1269 (6th Cir. 1990) \n(officers of corporation were entitled to arbitration as agents of corporation even though they had \nnot signed arbitration agreement), abrogation recognized in AtriCure, Inc., v. Meng, 12 F.4th 516 \n(2021), and Powell v. Sparrow Hosp., No. 1:10-CV-206, 2010 WL 2901875, at *1 (W.D. Mich. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1595   Filed 04/05/24   Page 13 of 22\nJuly 23, 2010), a 2010 ruling by this Court that contains an analysis in an employment case \nconsistent with Arnold.   \nAs Plaintiff points out in her response brief, Arnold has since been abrogated by AtriCure \nInc.4  Plaintiff distinguishes Powell from the present case by pointing out that the individual \ndefendants in that case were subject to the arbitration agreement because the claims against them \nwere  identical  to  those  against  the  company,  whereas  here,  she  alleges,  the  claims  are \nfundamentally different (ECF No. 76 at PageID.1510).  \nAs an initial matter, neither party contends that any of the Individual Defendants are \nsignatories to the Employment Agreement or either of its amendments.  Thus, the issue before the \nCourt is whether Michigan law supports a finding that they are nevertheless entitled to compel \narbitration in this case. \n  In Altobelli, 884 N.W.2d at 542, the Michigan Supreme Court held that when evaluating \nwhether a matter is subject to arbitration, a Courtโs โprimary task is to ascertain the intent of the \nparties at the time they entered into the agreement,โ which is determined by examining the \nlanguage of the agreement โaccording to its plain and ordinary meaning.โ  Altobelli was a former \nprincipal of a law firm who brought tort claims against several other principals of the firm \n \n4 When the Sixth Circuit issued its ruling in Arnold in 1990, โmany circuit courts used the federal \npolicy  favoring  arbitration  to  broadly  enforce  arbitration  contracts  in  favor  of  (or  against) \nnonparties under expansive readings of generic common-law concepts.โ  Atricure Inc., 12 F.4th at \n520.  But times have changed.  โ[T]he Supreme Court has since held that courts considering \nwhether arbitration clauses cover nonparties should neutrally apply the relevant state law that \notherwise governs.โ  Id. (citing Arthur Anderson LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S. 624, 630โ32 (2009)). \nWith the dispelling of the idea that a federal policy favoring arbitration should influence the issue, \nthe Sixth Circuit has concluded that there is โno roomโ for a โfederal โdice-loadingโโ rule of \nconstruction to resolve a state-law question.โ  Id. (citation omitted).  Under either federal law or \nMichigan law, the Court must determine whether Michiganโs contract law, โwhen fairly read, \npermits the defendants to enforce the arbitration clause even though they did not sign the contract.โ  \nId. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1596   Filed 04/05/24   Page 14 of 22\nchallenging actions they performed in their capacities as agents carrying out the business of the \nfirm.  A dispute arose when Altobelli sought to take a leave of absence from the firm to pursue a \nfootball coaching opportunity at the University of Alabama.  Id. at 541.  He alleged in his lawsuit \nthat he sought to take a 7- to 12-month period of leave while preserving his ownership interest and \nsenior principal position in the firm, and that he took actions in reliance on certain assurances by \nvarious  individual  defendants,  but  he  ended  up  having  his  equity  ownership  involuntarily \nterminated, and he was shorted income as a result.  Id.   \nThe partiesโ operating agreement in that case contained a mandatory arbitration provision \nthat covered โ[a]ny dispute, controversy, or claim . . . between the Firm or the Partnership and any \ncurrent or former Principal or Principals of the Firm or current or former partner or partners of the \nPartnership . . . . โ  Id. at 539.  In its analysis, the Michigan Supreme Court observed that a party \ncannot be required to arbitrate an issue that it has not agreed to submit to arbitration.  Id.  But it \nalso acknowledged the State of Michiganโs general policy of being favorable to arbitration, as \nreflected in the fact that the burden under Michigan law is on the party seeking to avoid the \nagreement, not the party seeking to enforce the agreement.  Id.   \nThe Altobelli court stated that โ[a]lthough no Michigan court has explicitly applied agency \nprinciples when interpreting an arbitration clause, it is well established that corporations can only \nact through officers and agents.โ  Id. at 543 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  โThis \nreflects the fact that a company is not a physical being capable of taking its own actions or making \nits own decisions.  Indeed, a firm cannot act on its own behalf.  Therefore, the acts of officers and \nagents of a corporation, within the scope of their employment, are the acts of the corporation.โ5  \n \n5 Altobelli had been an attorney at a law firm that was a professional limited liability company \nformed under the Michigan Limited Liability Company Act (MLLCA), MICH. COMP. LAWS \n450.4101 et seq.  Altobelli, 884 N.W.2d at 539.  In a footnote, the Supreme Court recognized that \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1597   Filed 04/05/24   Page 15 of 22\nId.  (citations  and  internal  quotations  omitted).    The  court  noted  that  when  interpreting  an \narbitration clause, other jurisdictions have similarly applied agency principles: \nIn Pritzker v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 7 F.3d 1110, 1122 \n(C.A.3, 1993) (citation omitted; alteration in original), the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit noted that a corporation โโcan only act through its \nemployees, and an arbitration agreement would be of little value if it did not extend \nto [them].โโ  In Arnold v. Arnold Corp- Printed Communications for Business, 920 \nF.2d 1269, 1281 (C.A. 6, 1990), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned that if \na plaintiff could โโavoid the practical consequences of an agreement to arbitrate by \nnaming . . . signatory parties in their individual capacities only, the effect of the rule \nrequiring arbitration would, in effect, be nullified.โโ (Citation omitted.)  The First \nCircuit agreed: \n \nSuch a rule is necessary, our sister circuits have reasoned, because a \ncorporate entity or other business can only operate through its \nemployees and an arbitration agreement would be a meaningless \narrangement if its terms did not extend to them . . . .   Any other rule, \nin  view  of  these  courts,  would  permit  the  party  bringing  the \ncomplaint to avoid the practical consequences of having signed an \nagreement to arbitrate; naming the other partyโs officers, directors \nor  employees  as  defendants  along  with  the  corporation  would \nabsolve the party of all obligations to arbitrate. Grand Wireless, Inc. \nv. Verizon Wireless, Inc. 748 F.3d. 1, 11 (C.A. 1, 2014) citing \nArnold, 920 F.2d at 1281. \n \nFor the above reasons, we hold that agency principles apply in determining who is \nincluded within the scope of the arbitration clause.6  \n \nId. at 544โ45.  In applying agency principles to the factual circumstances in Altobelli, the Michigan \nSupreme Court noted that the partiesโ operating agreement explicitly delegated authority to certain \nindividuals to carry out the firmโs business and manage its internal affairs, and the defendants were \nthose individuals operating on the firmโs behalf, being the five managing directors, the CEO, and \n \nโsome cited caselaw addresses situations where agents acted on behalf of a corporation, whereas, \nin the instant case, the Firm is a professional liability company,โ but it saw โno reason to \ndistinguish between a corporation and another type of company.โ  Id. at n.6. \n6 Although Arnold, 920 F.2d at 1269, has been abrogated, see AtriCure, 12 F.4th at 516, Altobelli, \n884 N.W.2d at 537, remains good law in Michigan regarding agency principles as applied to \narbitration agreements.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1598   Filed 04/05/24   Page 16 of 22\nthe head of the firmโs litigation group.  Id. at 546.  Concluding that the individual defendantsโ \nactions โwere acts of the company . . . because it is axiomatic that the Firm cannot act on its own, \nand because these particular defendants are clearly endowed with agency authority to administer \nthe Firmโs affairs,โ the court held that the individually named defendants must be included within \nthe meaning of โthe Firmโ in the arbitration clause.โ  Id. (citations to authority and internal \nquotations omitted). \nIn the present case, the Court first turns to the plain language of the arbitration clause of \nthe Employment Agreement in an effort to determine whether the parties intended to include the \nIndividual Defendants.  See id. at 545.  As noted earlier, the arbitration clause states as follows:    \nAny controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or \nthe breach thereof, shall be settled in accordance with the then existing rules of the \nAmerican Arbitration Association and judgment on the award rendered by the \narbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The fees and \nexpenses for such arbitration shall be paid equally by the Hospital and Physician \nAssistant. \n \n(Employment Agreement ยถ 28).  The arbitration clause does not identify who is bound by or \nentitled to enforce it.  Rather, it simply describes its scope, covering โ[a]ny controversy, dispute \nor claim arising out of or relating toโ the agreement, or a breach thereof, and that the fees and \nexpenses for such arbitration shall be paid equally by the Hospital and Physician Assistant.7   \n \n7 Plaintiff argues that because Paragraph 21 of the Employment Agreement states that the \nโCovenants of Sections 4, 12, and 29 shall survive the termination of this Agreement,โ that must \nmean that Section 28, the arbitration clause did not survive after she was terminated in 2021 under \nthe agreement (ECF No. 76 at PageID.1504โ05).  She similarly points to the termination letter she \nreceived and that fact that Defendant Pai made clear that Sections 12 and 29 continued to bind her \nbut made no mention of Section 28 (id. at PageID.1505).  Plaintiffโs argument lacks merit, as \nParagraphs 4, 12, and 29 pertain to covenants in which the parties agreed to do or not to do certain \nacts, even after the termination of the Employment Agreement.  Paragraph 28 pertains to the agreed \nupon method of resolving any disputes that arise out of or relate to the Employment Agreement \nand any breach thereof.    \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1599   Filed 04/05/24   Page 17 of 22\nThe Court next turns to Michiganโs contract and agency law.  As the Michigan Supreme \nCourt held in Altobelli, 884 N.W.2d at 543, โcorporations can only act through officers and agentsโ \nand โthe acts of officers and agents of a corporation, within the scope of their employment, are the \nacts of the corporation.โ  Understanding that Metro Health Hospital/UMHW cannot act on its own, \nbut instead depends on the actions of agents to carry out its business, the Court concludes that by \nsigning the arbitration agreement, Plaintiff was certainly aware that individuals in positions of \nauthority  over  decisions  concerning  her  employment  would  be  operating  on  Metro  Health \nHospital/UMHWโs behalf.8  See id. at 545 (โBy signing the Operating Agreement and accepting \nthe arbitration clause, plaintiff was aware that certain individuals would be operating on the Firmโs \nbehalfโ).   \nThe Individual Defendants were identified in Plaintiffโs Second Amended Complaint \nbecause they had control or influence over her employment, including whether to grant her request \nfor a religious accommodation and whether to terminate her employment.  Plaintiff argued as much \nwhen successfully opposing each of the Individual Defendantโs motions to dismiss.  In Count I of \nher Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that the Individual Defendants violated her \nconstitutional rights when they condemned her religious beliefs or tacitly approved of or shared \ntheir colleaguesโ animus toward her โwhile participating in the decision to terminateโ her (2d Am. \nCompl. ยถ 197).  In Count II, she alleges that Pierce and Smith โ[set] an accommodation denial into \nmotion by recommendingโ to Cole and Booker that her โaccommodation request be denied and \n \n8 Plaintiff argues that the Individual Defendants were not employed by the hospital when she \nsigned the 2009 Employment Agreement; however, she does not claim that they had not yet been \nemployed on June 30, 2021, when she signed Amendment #2, which indicated that all other terms \nand conditions of the Employment Agreement remained in full force and effect.  Moreover, the \nCourtโs analysis turns on the concept of agency, so their employment at the time she signed the \ncontract is irrelevant. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1600   Filed 04/05/24   Page 18 of 22\nher employment be terminated,โ whereafter Booker and Cole made the decision to deny her \naccommodation request and terminate her employment, and Pai ratified the decision (id. ยถ 240).  \nAnd in Count IV, she claims that the Individual Defendants retaliated against her for requesting a \nreligious accommodation and terminated her on the same basis (id. ยถยถ 286โ87).9   \nPlaintiff alleges that, in their respective roles as President; Vice President of Diversity, \nEquity and Inclusion; Director of Human Resources; Coordinator of the Diversity, Equity & \nInclusion  Program;  and  member  of  the  Advanced  Practice  Providersโ  Council,  each  of  the \nIndividual Defendants played a role in denying her a religious accommodation and terminating \nher.  In doing so, Plaintiff implicitly acknowledges that they were endowed with the power and \nresponsibility for managing the affairs of the hospital when it came to her employment and its \nconditions.    Because  the  Individual  Defendants  were  endowed  with  agency  authority  over \nPlaintiffโs employment with Metro Health Hospital/UMHW, they are included within arbitration \nclause of the Employment Agreement that Plaintiff entered into with the hospital.  \n5.  Scope of Arbitration Agreement \n  Last, Defendants argue that Plaintiffโs claims, including her civil rights and constitutional \nclaims and any requested remedy, fall within the scope of the arbitration clause (ECF No. 74 at \nPageID.1464โ1466; ECF No. 77 at PageID.1561โ1564).  Plaintiff argues that her claims are not \nsubject to the arbitration clause โfor three reasons:  1) there is no federal policy in favor of \narbitration;  2)  [Plaintiff]  lacked  notice  that  she  was  waiving  her  right  to  bring  statutory \ndiscrimination claims; and 3) arbitration is not the proper forum for her discrimination claim \nbecause of the employerโs superior bargaining powerโ (ECF No. 76 at PageID.1501).  \n \n9 At issue before the Court is โin what venue [P]laintiff must bring [her] dispute, not whether the \nIndividual Defendants may be held personally liable for the tortious actions alleged within the \ndispute.โ  See Altobelli, 884 N.W.2d at 545 n.9 (emphasis in original).  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1601   Filed 04/05/24   Page 19 of 22\n   Defendantsโ argument has merit. \n  The Court rejects Plaintiffโs first and third arguments for the reasons previously stated in \nthis Opinion.  As for her second argument, the Court notes that if the arbitration clause applies, \nPlaintiff will not be waiving her right to bring statutory discrimination claims; arbitration will \nmerely be the forum in which her claims will be resolved.  That leaves the ultimate question of \nwhether the subject matter of the instant dispute is covered by the arbitration clause.   \nโGenerally speaking, to ascertain whether the subject matter of a dispute is of the type that \nparties intended to submit to arbitration,โ the Court must โagain begin with the plain language of \nthe arbitration clause.โ  Altobelli, 884 N.W.2d at 545.  The Court must โthen consider whether a \nplaintiffโs particular action falls within that scope.โ  Id.  The gravamen of an action is determined \nby considering the entire claim to determine its exact nature, looking beyond mere procedural \nlabels.  Id. \n  Turning to the plain language of the arbitration clause, it broadly covers โany controversy, \ndispute, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereofโ (Employment \nAgreement ยถ 28) (emphasis added).  The Employment Agreement itself comprehensively covers \nall of the terms and conditions of Plaintiffโs employment, including her general duties, such as \ntaking โsuch actions as may be necessary to maintain and encourage the Hospitalโs relationship \nwith its patientsโ (id. ยถ 3), her employment term (id. ยถ 8), compensation (id. ยถ 9), and the Hospitalโs \nrights to terminate the Agreement (id. ยถ 11).  It states that it is โis the entire Agreement between \nthe parties regarding the terms and conditions of the Physician Assistantโs employmentโ (id. ยถ 19). \n  As for the gravamen of Plaintiffโs claims in her Second Amended Complaint, the Court \nconcludes that they all fall within the wide expanse of โany controversy, dispute, or claimโ arising \nout of or related to Plaintiffโs terms of employment with the hospital.  Plaintiff raises several \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1602   Filed 04/05/24   Page 20 of 22\nconstitutional and statutory civil rights violations associated with how the Defendants handled her \nattempt to freely exercise her religious beliefs in the workplace.  The crux of all of her claims is \nthat she was discriminated against and subjected to retaliation when Defendants refused her request \nfor an accommodation of the manner in which she maintained and encouraged her and the \nhospitalโs relationship with a particular set of patients, and she was instead terminated.   \nAltobelli is instructive.  Due to his loss of employment with the law firm, the plaintiff sued \nthe individual defendants alleging that they engaged in tortious conduct:  โbreach of fiduciary duty, \nillegal shareholder oppression contrary to MICH. COMP. LAWS ยง 450.4515, conversion, bad-faith \nmisrepresentation, tortious interference with a business relationship or expectancy, and civil \nconspiracy.โ  Altobelli, 884 N.W.2d at 541.  In each of his claims, the plaintiff took issue with the \nindividual defendantsโ actions as agents making decisions for the law firm, which the plaintiff \nbelieved interfered with his financial entitlements under the operating agreement.  Id. at 547.  The \nMichigan Supreme Court concluded that the gravamen of the plaintiffโs dispute fell within the \nscope of the mandatory arbitration clause in the operating agreement because โ[a] company can \nonly act through its agents, the individual defendants are agents of the Firm, and plaintiffโs claims \ninextricably tie defendantsโ actions as agents to the alleged deprivation of plaintiffโs rights under \nthe Operating Agreement.  Plaintiffโs dispute is subject to binding arbitration.โ  Id. \nHere, Plaintiffโs dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration clause because a company \ncan only act through its agents, the Individual Defendants were agents of the hospital, and \nPlaintiffโs claims inextricably tie their actions as agents to the alleged deprivation of her rights of \nemployment under the Employment Agreement with the hospital.    \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1603   Filed 04/05/24   Page 21 of 22\nIn sum, Plaintiff has failed to overcome her burden of establishing that the dispute is \nnonarbitrable and that the arbitration agreement is not valid or enforceable with respect to the \nremaining claims in this case.  Consequently, Defendantsโ motion to compel arbitration is granted.  \n6.  Dismissal of Plaintiffโs Case \nThe final question for the Court is whether to dismiss the instant action, given that all \nremaining claims are subject to arbitration.  Both Defendants and Plaintiff request that in the event \nthat the Court grants the motion to compel arbitration, the Court dismiss the case (ECF No. 74 at \nPageID.1468; ECF No. 76 at PageID.1516).  Under ยง 3 of the FAA, when a district court is \nโsatisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration ... [it] shall \non application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had \nin accordance with the terms of the agreement.โ  9 U.S.C. ยง 3.  The Sixth Circuit has interpreted \nthis language as mandating a stay when a party requests one.   Arabian Motors Grp. W.L.L. v. Ford \nMotor Co., 19 F.4th 938, 941 (6th Cir. 2021).  Neither has done so here. \nThe Court thus retains discretion over whether to stay or dismiss this action.  See id. at 942.  \nUnder the terms of the Employment Agreement and its incorporation of the AAA Rules, the \narbitrator has the power to award relief and to decide the underlying dispute (Employment \nAgreement ยถ 28).  As such, the Court anticipates that its only potential role moving forward will \nbe to enforce an arbitration award, so a dismissal is appropriate.  A final order also has the \nadvantage of creating an unambiguous pathway for appeal of the Courtโs decisionโan option that \nwould be unavailable to Plaintiff if the Court imposed a stay.  See 9 U.S.C. ยงยง 16(a)(3), (b)(1). \n \n \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 79,  PageID.1604   Filed 04/05/24   Page 22 of 22\nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, \n  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment to Compel \nArbitration (ECF No. 73) is GRANTED, and this case is DISMISSED. \nBecause this Opinion and Order resolves all pending claims, the Court will also enter a \nJudgment.

In  2004,  Metropolitan  Hospital  (hereinafter  โUniversity  of  Michigan  Health-\nWestโ) hired Valerie Kloosterman, MPAS, PA-C, as a physician assistant.  For the next 17 years, \nMs. Kloostermanโthe third generation in her family to work for her local health care system, and \n  1 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.2   Filed 10/11/22   Page 2 of 56\na married mother of four, including tripletsโreceived nothing but positive reviews and accolades \nfrom her superiors, her colleagues, and her patients.   \n2.  Throughout all but the final months of Ms. Kloostermanโs tenure, the hospital \ntreated her with appreciation and respect, and it did not seek to compel her to violate her religious \nbeliefs or her independent medical judgment.  But that changed in 2021 shortly after Metropolitan \nHospital culminated its affiliation with the University of Michigan Health System, rebranded itself \nUniversity of Michigan Health-West, and then fired Ms. Kloosterman for no reason other than her \nsincerely held religious beliefs.  \n3.  Through a mandatory diversity training and hostile discussions that followed it, the \nnewly branded University of Michigan Health-West attempted to compel Ms. Kloosterman to \npledge, against her sincerely held religious convictions and her medical conscience, that she would \nspeak  biology-obscuring  pronouns  and  make  referrals  for  โgender  transitionโ  drugs  and \nprocedures.  Yet during the entire duration of her employment, no patient ever asked her for a \nreferral for such drugs or procedures, and she never used pronouns contrary to a patientโs wishes. \n4.  This  dispute  about  hypotheticals  became  all  too  real  when  Ms.  Kloosterman \nrequested a religious accommodation.  University of Michigan Health-West officials summoned \nher to a meeting, during which they denigrated her religious beliefs, called her โevilโ and a โliar,โ \nmockingly told her that she could not take the Bible or her religious beliefs to work with her, and \nblamed her for gender dysphoria-related suicides.  They fired her on August 24, 2021, without \neven allowing her to finish her patientsโ charts for that day, to collect her belongings, or to say \nfarewell to beloved colleagues and patients. \n5.  At the same time that University of Michigan Health-West denied Ms. Kloosterman \nany form of religious accommodation, it accommodated, for other staff, a vast array of other \npersonal preferences, secular objections, and independent medical judgment.  A male doctor who \nwished to abstain from performing pelvic exams on female patients was never scheduled to do so, \nand many providers with personal objections to prescribing controlled substancesโopioidsโor \ndiet pills were easily accommodated by other providers who filled in for them, such that the \n  2 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.3   Filed 10/11/22   Page 3 of 56\nobjecting providers were not even placed in a situation that might call for a referral.  Despite \noffering others many non-religious accommodations for far more common drugs and proceduresโ\nincluding some that obviated the need for referralsโUniversity of Michigan Health-West did not \nconsider or provide to Ms. Kloosterman any accommodation for her religious beliefs. \n6.  University of Michigan Health-West violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 when it denied Ms. Kloosterman a religious accommodation and fired her because of her \nreligious  beliefs.    The  letter  explaining  her  termination  listed  three  reasons  for  firing  Ms. \nKloosterman, all of which directly related to her sincerely held religious beliefs about gender \nidentity  and  to  her  conscientious  objection  to  assisting  in  the  provision  of  certain  โgender \nreassignmentโ drugs and procedures.  If not for Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs about gender \nand sexuality, she would not have been fired.  The hospital officialsโ explicit attack on her religious \nbeliefs  provides  direct  evidence  that  her  termination  was  the  result  of  unlawful  religious \ndiscrimination. \n7.  Moreover,  during  Ms.  Kloostermanโs  employment  at  University  of  Michigan \nHealth-West,  the  17-year  absence  of  any  incidentโand  the  availability  of  multiple \naccommodations for others, for secular reasonsโforeclose any argument that University of \nMichigan Health-West could not accommodate Ms. Kloosterman.  When it learned of her religious \nbeliefs, and when its pressure on her to betray those beliefs failed, University of Michigan Health-\nWest had no interest in working toward a cooperative, religiously tolerant solution.  Instead, it \nsummarily fired her. \n8.  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  also  violated  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution in multiple ways.  \n9.  By exhibiting open hostility toward Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs, University \nof Michigan Health-West officials violated the Free Exercise Clause, as construed by the Supreme \nCourt in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018), and \nin Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, 142 S. Ct. 2407 (2022).  \n  3 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.4   Filed 10/11/22   Page 4 of 56\n10.  By  accommodating  secular  preferences  while  refusing  to  grant  a  religious \naccommodation to Ms. Kloosterman, University of Michigan Health-Westโs actions trigger and \nfail strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause, as construed in the Supreme Courtโs decisions \nin Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868 (2021), Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 1294 \n(2021), and Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, 142 S. Ct. 2407 (2022), and therefore violate \nthe Free Exercise Clause.  \n11.  By seeking to compel Ms. Kloosterman to speak biology-obscuring pronouns that \nwould violate her conscience and her medical judgment, as doing so could cause patients to miss \npotentially life-saving screenings, University of Michigan Health-West also violated the Free \nSpeech Clause, as construed by the Sixth Circuit in Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492 (6th Cir. \n2021).  \n12.  When  it  engaged  in  the  aforementioned  actions  and  fired  Ms.  Kloosterman, \nUniversity of Michigan Health-West also violated the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Equal Protection \nClause, as well as Article I, ยงยง 2, 4, and 5 of the Michigan Constitution and the Elliott-Larsen Civil \nRights Act of 1976, Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 37.2202. \n13.  It was unlawful, unconstitutional, and intolerant of University of Michigan Health-\nWest to demand that Ms. Kloosterman abandon her religious beliefs and her medical ethics to \nremain employed.  The Court must hold University of Michigan Health-West and the individual \nDefendants accountable for their blatant religious discrimination and other violations of Ms. \nKloostermanโs legal rights, and must make Ms. Kloosterman whole by ordering her reinstatement; \npayment of her lost wages and benefits; declaratory and injunctive relief; actual, punitive, and \nnominal damages; and all other applicable remedies, as prayed for below. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  This civil rights action raises federal questions under the United States Constitution, \nparticularly the First and Fourteenth Amendments; the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; \nand Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e. \n15.  This Court has original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343.  \n  4 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.5   Filed 10/11/22   Page 5 of 56\n16.

Suit  is  timely  against  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  under  42  U.S.C. \nยง 2000e-5(e)(1)  because  Ms.  Kloosterman  filed  a  timely  charge  of  discrimination  against \nUniversity of Michigan Health-West on May 16, 2022, Exhibit A amended that charge of \ndiscrimination on June 17, 2022, Exhibit B; and received on July 14, 2022, from the U.S. Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission (โEEOCโ), notice of her right to bring this suit, Exhibit C.   \nIDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES \n20.

Ms. Kloosterman is a devout Christian and longtime member of a United Reformed \nChurch, which she has attended since her baptism as an infant.  Ms. Kloostermanโs church is part \nof a denomination called the United Reformed Churches in North America.  She is a faithful and \ninvolved member of the church, attending regularly with her husband and their four children, as \nwell as her parents and other members of her extended family.  \n32.  Ms. Kloostermanโs vibrant faith informs how she does her work as a medical \nprofessional, through her humility, her love for others, and her desire to use the gifts and training \nthat God has given her to help others.  Below is a photograph of Ms. Kloosterman. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n33.  According to her coworkers, Ms. Kloostermanโs conduct reflects her character and \nher servantโs heart, as she seeks to treat others the way that Jesus would, which is one reason why \nher patients always loved her.  \n34.  Ms. Kloosterman and her church believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, \nand they also hold to several confessions that they believe faithfully summarize Biblical teachings: \n  7 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.8   Filed 10/11/22   Page 8 of 56\nthe Belgic Confession of 1561, the Heidelberg Catechism of 1563, and the Canons of Dort of 1618-\n19. \n35.  Ms. Kloosterman believes, consistent with the teachings of the Bible and her \nchurch, that all humans are created in Godโs image and thus deserving of love and respect. \n36.  Ms. Kloosterman also believes that God created humans male and female as a \nunique expression of His image.  These beliefs derive from the Bible, specifically Genesis 1:26-\n27.  \n37.  These  and  other  beliefsโshared  by  Ms.  Kloosterman  and  her  church  and \ndenominationโare described in a document called Affirmations Regarding Marriage, which \nreflects beliefs that Christians have held for two millennia.1  \n38.  As a devout Christian, Ms. Kloosterman believes that oneโs sex is ordained by God, \nthat one should love and care for the body that God gave him or her, and that one should not \nattempt to erase or to alter his or her sex, especially through drugs or surgical means.  \n39.  Ms. Kloosterman believes that she must not speak against these truths by using \npronouns that contradict a personโs biological sex.  \n40.  Ms. Kloosterman also believes that God has ordained the sexual function for \nprocreation,  that  children  are  a  gift  from  God,  and  that  โgender  reassignmentโ  drugs  and \nprocedures have a permanently sterilizing effect that cannot be justified by the desire to erase or \nalter oneโs sex. \n41.  As a Christian medical professional, Ms. Kloosterman believes that it would be \nsinful to assist a patient in procuring sterilizing drugs or surgical procedures designed to erase or \nalter his or her sex.  This religious objection has nothing to do with the background or identity of \nthe patient, but rather the nature of the drugs and procedures that the patient might request. \n \n \n1  Affirmations  Regarding  Marriage,  United  Reformed  Churches  in  North  America  (2018), \nhttps://www.urcna.org/file_retrieve/63166.  \n  8 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.9   Filed 10/11/22   Page 9 of 56\n \nMs. Kloostermanโs Sincere Religious Belief that She Must Honor Her Hippocratic Oath \n42.  Ms. Kloosterman, a Christian medical professional, also has religious beliefs that \nare intertwined with her medical judgment.   \n43.  Ms. Kloosterman has taken the Hippocratic oath to โdo no harmโ to her patients.  \nHer  Christian  faith  compels  her  both  to  honor  her  Hippocratic  oath  and  to  be  honest  and \ncompassionate in her dealings with others.  She therefore believes that it would be dishonest and \nsinful to violate her conscience and oath by knowingly facilitating a drug or procedure thatโin \nher independent medical judgmentโwill bring to a patient more harm than benefit.  \n44.  Indeed, during the duration of Ms. Kloostermanโs employment, her employment \ncontract required her to โexercise [her] independent medical judgment consistent with the clinical \nneeds and consent of each patient,โ and it stated that โthe Hospital shall not have the right to direct \n[her] to take or omit any act which conflicts with such medical judgment in the care of patients.โ  \nExhibit D. \n45.  Ms.  Kloostermanโs  independent  medical  judgment  is  that  โpuberty  blockers,โ \nโhormone therapy,โ and โgender reassignment surgeryโ are experimental, lack validation in \nmethodologically rigorous long-term studies, and often lead to negative clinical outcomes such as \nbone density loss, infection, nerve damage, chronic pain, loss of sexual and urinary functions, \npsychological trauma, and other serious complications.  \n46.  Ms.  Kloostermanโs  medical  judgment  also  counsels  against  entering  in \ndocumentation pronouns that obscure or misrepresent a personโs biological sex, as doing so can \ncause patients to miss potentially life-saving screenings and procedures like pregnancy tests, \nmammograms, and testicular exams. \n47.  Therefore, Ms. Kloosterman believes that it would be dishonest and sinful to violate \nher conscience and Hippocratic oath by acting against her medical judgment to prescribe or to refer \npatients for โpuberty blockers,โ โhormone therapy,โ or โgender reassignment surgery,โ or by \nentering in documentation pronouns that obscure or misrepresent a patientโs biological sex.  This \n  9 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.10   Filed 10/11/22   Page 10 of 56\nreligious objection has nothing to do with the background or identity of the patient, but rather the \nnature of the drugs and procedures that the patient might request. \nMs. Kloostermanโs Exemplary Employment Record \n48.  Ms. Kloosterman worked for Metropolitan Hospital ever since her graduation in \n2004, long before its 2016 affiliation with the University of Michigan Health System that resulted \nin University of Michigan Health-West becoming a subsidiary of the University of Michigan \nHealth System (now called โMichigan Medicineโ), which in turn is operated by the University of \nMichigan Board of Regents.2 \n49.  Ms. Kloosterman performed her duties at Metro Health Caledonia, which is an \noutpatient clinic specializing in Internal, Family, and Pediatric Medicine. \n50.  Metro Health Caledonia (now called Caledonia Health Center) is operated by \nMetropolitan Hospital, d/b/a University of Michigan Health-West, which has its principal place of \nbusiness as a hospital located about 15 minutes away in Wyoming, Michigan.  \n51.  Ms. Kloostermanโs mother and grandmother both worked in that local health care \nsystem for over 40 years, and Ms. Kloosterman worked there for her entire career.  Thus, Ms. \nKloosterman is a third-generation healthcare professional serving her local community.  \n52.  During  Ms.  Kloostermanโs  17-year  employment  as  a  physician  assistant  for \nMichigan Health, she cared for patients of all ages and backgrounds.  She was especially popular \nwith younger patients, including children.  Some of her pediatric patients were second-generation, \nbecause she treated their parents when they were children.  \n \n2 See Upshaw v. SSJ Group, LLC, No. 1:19-cv-341-PLM-PJG, ECF No. 126, Defendants University of \nMichigan Board of Regents and University of Michigan Health Systemโs Amended Motion to Dismiss (filed July 31, \n2020), at ECF pg. 13, n.1 (โThe University of Michigan Health System is operated by the University of Michigan \nBoard of Regents, which itself is a State entity. . . .  For clarity, Metropolitan Hospital . . . is a subsidiary of the \nRegents, a separate legal entity, governed by an independent board of directors.โ); see also Mary Masson, U-M Health \nSystem,  Metro  Health  Moving  Forward  with  Affiliation,  The  University  Record  (Sept.  15,  2016), \nhttps://perma.cc/DPF3-FQBN (describing affiliation agreement between Metropolitan Hospital and the Board of \nRegents, and quoting the chair of the Board of Regents as stating that โthe affiliation โsends a message that as a health \nsystem and a university, we are eager to expandโโ). \n  10 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.11   Filed 10/11/22   Page 11 of 56\n53.  Ms. Kloosterman consistently received exemplary performance reviews and was \nnever once subject to discipline. \n54.  In one typical performance review, her supervisor commented: โValerie goes way \nbeyond the call of duty when dealing with patients, follow up and professional responsibility.  She \nis very ethical [and] responsible and treats all with respect.โ  Exhibit E (emphasis in original). \n55.  Another typical performance review described Ms. Kloosterman as โ[a] pleasure to \nwork with[,] excellent knowledge, ethics, respect, communication, and skills.โ  Exhibit E. \n56.  Ms. Kloostermanโs reputation among her patients was stellar.  She was widely \nknown to be a very patient, caring provider.  She would spend very generous amounts of time with \nher patients because she cared about them.  \n57.  Many patients would specifically request Ms. Kloosterman and were willing to wait \nfor an appointment with her if her schedule was full.  Even many months after she was fired, Ms. \nKloostermanโs former patients have continued to ask about her and to express how much they miss \nher.  \n58.  Ms. Kloosterman also had an excellent reputation among her fellow staff members.  \nShe was known for being thorough, exact, and knowledgeable about her medicine.  And when she \nwas unsure how to handle something, she would ask her supervising physician for guidance.  She \nalso had strong working relationships with everyone on staff at her clinic.  \n59.  As her excellent performance reviews indicate, Ms. Kloosterman gladly served \npeople of all beliefs and backgrounds and was committed to giving the best possible care to all her \npatients, including those who identified as lesbian, gay, or experiencing gender dysphoria. \n60.  For instance, she provided ongoing care for approximately a dozen patients whom \nshe knew to identify as lesbian.  \n61.  Ms. Kloosterman also treated two patients who may have used preferred pronouns \nother than those that would correspond to the patientsโ biological sex.  \n62.  These  patients  came  to  Ms.  Kloosterman  for  a  potential  brain  tumor  and  a \nrespiratory issue, and she cared for both of them to the best of her ability.  \n  11 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.12   Filed 10/11/22   Page 12 of 56\n63.  Neither patient requested a different provider or otherwise expressed dissatisfaction \nwith the excellent care that Ms. Kloosterman provided.  \n64.  For both patients, in both her medical notes and in the examination room, Ms. \nKloosterman used the patientโs name (without pronouns) without any disruption to the patientโs \ncare.  She also conducted at least one follow-up phone call and one follow-up visit with one of the \npatients, while the other did not need a follow--up visit.  \n65.  In medical charts, Ms. Kloosterman never changed or edited the pre-filled sex or \ngender field, nor did she ever have the ability to change that information as any such change could \nonly be done by administrative office staff, not medical providers. \n66.  Ms. Kloosterman never used pronouns that went against a patientโs wishes.  \n67.  Moreover, during the entire duration of her employment, no patient ever asked her \nfor a referral to another provider for โgender reassignmentโ drugs or procedures.  \n68.  Throughout Ms. Kloostermanโs employment, she never discussed with any patient \nher viewsโreligious or otherwiseโon human gender or sexuality. \nUniversity of Michigan Health-West Targets Ms. Kloosterman for Her Religious Beliefs \n69.  In 2016, twelve years after Ms. Kloosterman began working at her local clinic, \nMetropolitan Hospital began the process of affiliating with the University of Michigan Health \nSystem.  \n70.  The affiliation was a gradual process, culminating in the name change to its current \nnameโUniversity of Michigan Health-Westโin June 2021.  Since the affiliation, both the \nhospital and the outpatient clinic where Ms. Kloosterman worked have been a subsidiary of the \nUniversity of Michigan Board of Regents, which operates Michigan Medicine (formerly the \nUniversity of Michigan Health System).3 \n \n3 See Upshaw v.

For clarity, Metropolitan Hospital . . . is a subsidiary of the \nRegents, a separate legal entity, governed by an independent board of directors.โ). \n  12 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.13   Filed 10/11/22   Page 13 of 56\n71.  On information and belief, the University of Michigan Board of Regents, by virtue \nof the affiliation agreement or otherwise, has the authority to direct or to require the creation and \nimplementation  of  policies  at  University  of  Michigan  Health-West,  and  has  exercised  that \nauthority.  On information and belief, the University of Michigan Board of Regents, by virtue of \nthe affiliation agreement or otherwise, has the authority to direct or to require the creation and \nimplementation of the University of Michigan Health-West policies at issue in this caseโ\nincluding any diversity, equity, and inclusion policiesโand has in fact exercised that authority.  \nOn information and belief, University of Michigan Health-West holds itself out to the public as a \nstate entity by its affiliation with the University of Michigan Board of Regents, by its status as a \nsubsidiary of the University of Michigan Board of Regents, by its use of the โUniversity of \nMichiganโ name, and by other means. \n72.  The University of Michigan Board of Regents is a state actor under Michigan law. \n73.  In 2018, University of Michigan Health-West required Ms. Kloosterman to do a \ntraining segment on serving LGBTQ+ patients.  Ms. Kloosterman had no religious objection to \nthis, as she was not required to affirm any statement during the training, which was merely for \neducation purposes. \n74.  Between May and June 2021, University of Michigan Health-West required Ms. \nKloosterman to complete another mandatory training module.  This time, the module contained a \nrequirement to affirm statements concerning sexual orientation and gender identity that her \nChristian faith prohibited her from affirming.  \n75.  Ms. Kloosterman could not complete the training unless she checked boxes that \naffirmed the statements and essentially pledged her agreement with University of Michigan \nHealth-Westโs express and implied positions on gender, sex, and sexual orientation.  There was no \noption within the training for her to explain her position or to request a religious accommodation.  \nThe training was due on June 30, 2021, and if Ms. Kloosterman did not complete the training \nmodule by July 15, 2021, she would be terminated. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.14   Filed 10/11/22   Page 14 of 56\n76.  Ms. Kloosterman consulted with Defendant Smith, who was in a liaison role \nconnecting the providers with HR, her supervising physician, and her office manager, and she \nprayed about the matter for three weeks.  \n77.  Both Defendant Smith and Ms. Kloostermanโs supervising physician told her to do \nwhat she felt was right in her heart. \n78.  Amy DeGood, the office manager for the Caledonia clinic, told Ms. Kloosterman \nto talk with University of Michigan Health-West representatives from the Department of Diversity, \nEquity, and Inclusion (DEI). \n79.  In mid-June, Ms. Kloosterman contacted Defendant Dr. Rhae-Ann Booker, the vice \npresident of the DEI Department, and requested a meeting. But Defendant Booker was not \navailable to meet until July 1, after the training was due, so Ms. Kloosterman decided to complete \nthe training module and to explain her position to University of Michigan Health-West separately. \n80.   Ms. Kloosterman arranged a meeting with Defendant Booker to inform University \nof Michigan Health-West that her faith precluded her from agreeing with the statements.  \n81.  Ms. Kloostermanโs faith compelled her to seek a reasonable accommodation for \nher religious beliefs.  \n82.  On or about July l, 2021, Ms. Kloosterman met with Defendant Booker to request \na  religious  accommodation  and  explained  why  her  faith  precluded  her  from  affirming  the \nstatements in the training module.  \n83.  When Defendant Booker indicated her assumption that Ms. Kloosterman was \nโuncomfortableโ seeing gay and lesbian patients, Ms. Kloosterman corrected her and explained \nthat she had seen several LGBTQ patients during her 17 years of employment and that she would \ngladly continue seeing these patients.  Defendant Booker indicated that she would speak with HR. \n84.  On or about July 29, 2021, Ms. Kloosterman met with University of Michigan \nHealth-West representatives from both the HR and DEI Departments: Defendant Marla Cole, HR \nDirector; Defendant Thomas Pierce, DEI Program Director; and Defendant Catherine Smith,  a \nmember of the Advanced Practice Providersโ Council. \n  14 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.15   Filed 10/11/22   Page 15 of 56\n85.  Defendant Smith is a Nurse Practitioner whose role was to serve as a liaison for \nMs. Kloosterman when interacting with Human Resources.  \n86.  Although  Ms.  Kloosterman  had  previously  met  Defendant  Smith,  who  had \nshadowed in her clinic as a student, Ms. Kloosterman had never previously met Defendant Cole \nor Defendant Pierce.  \n87.   These attendees indicated that Amy DeGood also attended the meeting by listening \nover the phone. \n88.  This meeting, which lasted over an hour, focused on whether Ms. Kloosterman \nwould use gender identity-based pronouns and be willing to refer patients for โgender reassignment \nsurgery.โ  \n89.  When Ms. Kloosterman respectfully indicated that she could not do so because of \nher religious beliefs and because of her independent medical judgment, but that she would use \npatientsโ names in place of pronouns to respect their wishes, Defendant Pierce grew hostile, visibly \nangry with tight fists and a flushed demeanor, and attacked Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs. \n90.  Among other things, Defendant Pierce told Ms. Kloosterman that she could not take \nthe Bible or her religious beliefs to work with her, either literally or figuratively; and that she was \nabusing her power as a health care provider to manipulate patients.  Defendant Pierce also \nrhetorically asked if Ms. Kloosterman knew โwhat would happen if we let every providerโ take \ntheir religious beliefs to work, suggesting that religious beliefs do not belong in the workplace. \n91.  Ms. Kloosterman respectfully explained that she never sought power over a patient \nbut merely served as part of each patientโs care team with his or her best interests in mind.  \nDefendant Pierce interrupted her and called her โevilโ for not giving patients exactly what they \nwanted because of her religious beliefs. \n92.  Ms. Kloosterman respectfully explained that medical providers have multiple ways \nof treating most conditions and are not necessarily obligated to give patients everything they asked \nfor, such as antibiotics for viral infections, opioids, or surgery for non-chronic back pain, if doing \nso went against the providersโ medical judgment. \n  15 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.16   Filed 10/11/22   Page 16 of 56\n93.  During the meeting, Ms. Kloosterman respectfully explained some of the reasons \nbehind her medical conscience objection to facilitating โgender reassignment surgeries.โ \n94.  When Ms. Kloosterman respectfully explained that she had treated patients who \nwere gay and lesbian for several years without any complaints, Defendant Pierce called her a โliarโ \nand said if he came to Ms. Kloosterman as a patient and she used his name rather than his preferred \npronoun, he would never come back to see her. \n95.  Defendant Pierce also asked Ms. Kloosterman whether she knew that by using a \npatientโs name instead of his or her preferred pronouns, she would cause him or her to commit \nsuicide.  When he said that this assertion was well-documented, Ms. Kloosterman cited some \nscientific studies that showed otherwise.  \n96.  In a hostile tone, Defendant Pierceโwho, on information and belief, has no formal \nmedical training or education and is not licensed to practice medicineโtold Ms. Kloosterman that \nhe had studies that would disprove her studies. \n97.  When  the  representatives  asked  Ms.  Kloosterman  what  she  would  do  about \npronouns on patient charts, she explained that pronouns are not always given for charting and if \nthere were any pre-formulated pronouns, she could use the patientโs first name, as she had done in \nthe past without any complaints or disruption to patient service.  Ms. Kloosterman also explained \nthat other providers would not become aware of her beliefs when reading her charts.  In other \nwords, Ms. Kloosterman was not seeking to impose her beliefs on, or to proselytize, anyone. \n98.  Ms. Kloosterman also explained that she did not even have the ability to change a \npatientโs sex or gender on his or her chart because only administrative office staff had that ability, \nrather than medical providers. \n99.  After an hour, Defendant Pierce left the meeting.  Defendant Cole then said that the \ndiscussion with Defendant Pierce had been intense and that everyone should take a breath.  Ms. \nKloosterman indicated that she would be glad to continue the conversation, if it would be helpful. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.17   Filed 10/11/22   Page 17 of 56\n100.  Despite Defendant Smithโs role as Advanced Providersโ Practice Liaison to help \nMs. Kloosterman during interactions with Human Resources, Defendant Smith did nothing to \nsupport Ms. Kloosterman or to contradict the hostile statements by Defendant Pierce. \nUniversity of Michigan Health-West Fires Ms. Kloosterman Because of Her Religious Beliefs \n101.  After the July 29 meeting, Ms. Kloosterman heard nothing further until August 23, \nwhen a meeting for August 24 appeared on her calendar, with the meeting scheduled for a time \nwhen she would normally be seeing patients.  The meeting was at University of Michigan Health-\nWest Hospital with Defendants Cole and Smith, not at the clinic where Ms. Kloosterman worked, \nand the subject line merely said: โtouch base.โ   \n102.  Ms. Kloosterman left a voicemail with Defendant Cole and an instant message with \nDefendant Smith inquiring about the purpose of the meeting, but those communications went \nunanswered.  Ms. Kloosterman also asked Ms. DeGood about this meeting, and Ms. DeGood said \nthat she did not know what the meeting was about.  \n103.  Ms. Kloosterman called HR and asked if she needed to reschedule her appointments \nwith patients so that she could make it to the meeting.  Hearing no response, she finished her \nappointments with patients and left her charts undone to finish afterward.  \n104.  Ms. Kloosterman had no prior notice that she would be terminated at this meeting. \n105.  That day, on August 24, 2021, when Ms. Kloosterman walked into the meeting \nroom at the hospital, Defendant Cole was present, and there was an envelope on the table that \ncontained Ms. Kloostermanโs termination notice, which indicated an effective termination date of \nNovember 22, 2021.  Exhibit F. The notice did not disavow the statements that Defendant Pierce \nmade in attacking Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs at the July 29 meeting. \n106.  Defendant Smith entered the room and said that, because Ms. Kloosterman refused \nto use preferred pronouns and because she refused to refer for โgender reassignment surgeries,โ \nshe no longer worked at University of Michigan Health-West. \n107.  Ms.  Kloosterman  responded:  โIf  this  is  about  my  Christian  beliefs,  I  cannot \nabandon them.  But I will always treat patients appropriately.โ  \n  17 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.18   Filed 10/11/22   Page 18 of 56\n108.  Defendant Smith responded by saying that despite the fact that Ms. Kloosterman \nhad a โwork aroundโ for preferred pronouns, it had been decided that โtodayโ was her last day, \nthat she no longer worked at University of Michigan Health-West, and that she was not allowed \non its property.  They told her to give them her badge and that her patient charts would be \ncompleted for her. Ms. Kloosterman mentioned that she had promised some patients she would \ncall them to follow up with test results from that dayโs appointments, and she was told only, โYou \nno longer work for University of Michigan.โ  \n109.  Ms. Kloosterman was not allowed to return to the clinic where she had worked for \n17 years.  Defendants Cole and Smith told her that Ms. DeGood would call her when her personal \nitems were boxed up.  \n110.  It  is  the  policy  and  practice  of  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  to  not \naccommodate, and to silence, employees who hold religious beliefs about gender and sexuality \nthat are contrary to its own agenda.  \n111.  The University of Michigan Health-West maintains a speech code whereby medical \nproviders and employees may not use pronouns associated with a patientโs biological sex if the \npatient prefers different pronouns. \n112.  The University of Michigan Health-West maintains a speech code that allows for \nhecklerโs vetoes of the speech of medical providers.  \n113.  It is the policy and practice of University of Michigan Health-West to require \nemployees to use pronouns as preferred by patients, regardless of whether they correspond with \nbiological sex. \n114.  It is the policy and practice of University of Michigan Health-West to interfere with \nthe independent medical judgment of its professional medical employees by requiring them to \nprescribe, to recommend, or to give referrals for โgender transitionโ drugs and procedures based \non University of Michigan Health-Westโs view of gender and sexuality rather than the best interest \nof the patient as determined by the providerโs independent medical judgment.  \n  18 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.19   Filed 10/11/22   Page 19 of 56\n115.  On information and belief, Defendants Pai, Pierce, and Booker implement and \nenforce the universityโs speech code for University of Michigan Health-West. \n116.   The evening of August 24, 2021, after Ms. Kloosterman was fired, Ms. DeGood \nsent a group text to eight of the providers at her clinic, calling for a mandatory meeting the next \nmorning.  \n117.   Nurse Practitioner Julie Stinton noticed that one provider was missing, so she \ntexted Ms. Kloosterman, who called her in tears telling her about the termination.  \n118.   Nurse Practitioner Stinton immediately texted Ms. DeGood to ask why she had left \nMs. Kloosterman off the chain, but Ms. DeGood did not give a straight answer.  \n119.   The 7:00 a.m. mandatory meeting on August 25 was conducted over WebEx with \nthree  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  administratorsโDefendant  Rakesh  โRakiโ  Pai, \nDefendant Marla Cole, and a female staff member from the DEI officeโwho had never previously \nmet Ms. Kloostermanโs coworkers.  \n120.   Defendant Smith was also on the August 25 call.  All she said was that โValerie \nno longer works for the University of Michigan.โ  Then she asked if there were any questions.  \n121.   Nurse Practitioner Stinton asked Defendant Pai, the one who had made the ultimate \ndecision to fire Ms. Kloosterman and signed the termination letter, if he had made any effort to \nfind out what Ms. Kloosterman was like before he fired her, if he had ever met her, or even if he \nknew what she looked like.  \n122.  Defendant Pai responded that, no, he had never met Ms. Kloosterman.  He said: \nโShe had a clear violation, but I cannot tell you what that violation was.โ  \n123.  A DEI staff member spoke up and said that Ms. Kloosterman violated something \nin her contract, but none of the administrators would say what the violation was.  \n124.  Dr. Michael Kogut and Nurse Practitioner Stinton were the only staff who asked \nquestions at this meeting. Defendant Cole, Defendant Pai, Defendant Smith, and the other DEI \nstaff member refused to give any meaningful information or to directly answer their questions.  \n  19 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.20   Filed 10/11/22   Page 20 of 56\n125.  Defendants  attempted  to  damageโand  in  fact  damagedโMs.  Kloostermanโs \nreputation by communicating to her former coworkers that Ms. Kloosterman had done something \nso egregious as to justify her termination, by refusing to elaborate on what that was, and by \nconcealing the truth about what had prompted her termination. \n126.  Ms. Kloostermanโs former coworkers were upset enough about her termination that \nan additional staff meeting in person was held. This meeting did not satisfy the concerns or answer \nthe questions that Ms. Kloostermanโs former coworkers had about why such a beloved provider \nhad been suddenly fired. \n127.  The week after Ms. Kloosterman was fired, Ms. DeGood sent an email to her \ncoworkers, expressing: โ[T]his is a huge loss to our team.  [Valerie] was/is an amazing provider.  \nShe will be missed tremendously.โ  \n128.   Ms. DeGood also expressed: โI can not disclose many of the details surrounding \nthis decision,โ and โI know Valerie is very saddened by the fact that she can not say goodbye to \nall of you.โ  The complete email is attached as Exhibit G. \n129.  On September 3, 2021, ten days after Ms. Kloosterman was fired, she received a \nletter memorializing the reasons for her termination, which was signed by Defendant Smith on \nUniversity of Michigan Health letterhead.  Defendant Smith listed her unwillingness to refer \nโgender transitioningโ patients for certain drugs and procedures, her unwillingness to use pronouns \nthat do not correspond to a patientโs biological sex, and a newly fabricated and baseless allegation \nthat Ms. Kloosterman had altered medical records to change patientsโ templated pronouns (a false \ncharge that Ms. Kloosterman continues to deny).  Exhibit H.   \n130.  While Defendant Smith had signed the September 3, 2021 letter, on information \nand belief, all Defendants conferred about and contributed to the letter, including its newly \nfabricated and baseless allegation that Ms. Kloosterman had altered patientsโ medical records. \n131.  Like the termination notice, the September 3, 2021 letter did not disavow the \nstatements that Defendant Pierce made in attacking Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs at the July \n29 meeting.   \n  20 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.21   Filed 10/11/22   Page 21 of 56\n132.  Ms.  Kloosterman  has  never  received  any  communication  from  any  of  the \nDefendants disavowing Defendant Pierceโs July 29 statements attacking her religious beliefs.  On \ninformation and belief, in making the decision to terminate Ms. Kloosterman, all Defendants \nshared the same anti-religious motives that Defendant Pierce made explicit during the July 29 \nmeeting. \n133.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendants  Pai,  Booker,  Cole,  Pierce,  and  Smith \nparticipated in the decision to terminate Ms. Kloostermanโs employment. \n134.  On information and belief, Defendants Pai, Booker, Cole, and Smith shared the \nanti-religious animus that Defendant Pierce made explicit during the July 29, 2021, meeting. \n \nUniversity of Michigan Health-Westโs Ability and Willingness to Accommodate Common \nNon-Religious Preferences  \n135.  In contrast to University of Michigan Health-Westโs complete refusal to \nconsider any sort of religious accommodation for Ms. Kloosterman, University of Michigan \nHealth-West and the clinic where Ms. Kloosterman worked have long accommodated non-\nreligious personal and medical objections to performing or referring for certain procedures and to \nprescribing or referring for certain medicationsโwithout any negative consequences for the \nobjecting provider.  These accommodations were easily accomplished given the clinicโs patient \nintake and scheduling process, which ensures that staff know ahead of time the reason for a \npatientโs visit and can schedule an appropriate staff member to see the patient. \n136.  Many providers at the Metro Health Caledonia clinic had personal or medical \nobjections to performing certain procedures, such as hemorrhoid removals; and these objections \nwere accommodated without any issues.  They would simply delegate conducting any such \nprocedure to another provider who was willing to perform that procedure, and the patients never \nexperienced any interruption in care.   \n137.  None of the providers at the clinic are willing to perform toenail removals.  \nThe office staff directs patients with toenail-removal needs directly to a podiatrist.  No patient has \never complained about this practice. \n  21 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.22   Filed 10/11/22   Page 22 of 56\n138.  As another example, Dr. Michael Kogut is a male doctor who does not perform \nfemale pelvic exams, breast exams, or prescribe hormones.  On information and belief, Dr. Kogutโs \nobjection is personal, not based on religious beliefs.  \n139.  In the six years that Dr. Kogut has worked at the clinic, he has not had to do these \nexams.  The office staff knows about his objection and will often schedule female patients to meet \nwith him for their physical but then to meet with a female provider for their pelvic and/or breast \nexam.  No patients have ever complained about this arrangement.  \n140.  Many  providers  at  the  clinic  have  medical  objections  to  prescribing  certain \nstimulant diet pills.  Only two providers are willing to prescribe them.  \n141.  If a patient expresses interest in this type of treatment for weight loss, he or she is \ntold to schedule an appointment with Nurse Practitioner Stinton, who explains the benefits and \ndrawbacks of diet pills.  \n142.  The providers who are not willing to prescribe diet pills have never had to prescribe \nthem.  And a patient who seeks diet pills never even knows if there was a schedule or provider \nchange, let alone the reason for the change.  The office staff merely switches the patientโs \nappointment to be with Nurse Practitioner Stinton instead of with the providers who object to \nprescribing diet pills. \n143.  For all the examples listed above, the clinicโs practice of accommodating providersโ \nnon-religious objections, by scheduling patients with other providers, meant that the objecting \nprovider would not be asked to give a referral. \n144.  Had  it  been  willing  to  consider  Ms.  Kloostermanโs  accommodation  request, \nUniversity  of  Michigan  Health-West  easily  could  have  made  an  accommodation  without \ndisruption to the clinicโs operations.   \n145.  Given the clinicโs patient intake and scheduling proceduresโin which office staff \nlearned the reason for patient visits before patients spoke to a provider, and in which office staff \nwere able to choose which provider would initially meet with each patientโhad the issue ever \narisen, University of Michigan Health-West easily could have accommodated Ms. Kloosterman \n  22 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.23   Filed 10/11/22   Page 23 of 56\nby not scheduling her for any patient visit that related to โpuberty blockers,โ โhormone therapy,โ \nor โgender reassignment surgery.โ  Nurse Practitioner Stinton and Ms. Kloostermanโs other \ncoworkers would happily have stood in for Ms. Kloosterman during the extraordinarily rare \ninstances when such an accommodation might have become necessary.   \n146.  University of Michigan Health-West also easily could have accommodated Ms. \nKloosterman by posting a notice that welcomes patients who missed any requested services to call \nthe Wyoming or Ann Arbor hospitals for assistance.   \n147.  And given that Ms. Kloostermanโs practice of using patientsโ names rather than \nbiology-obscuring pronouns had been successful and had not caused any disruption to patient care \nor changed any other providerโs views concerning the patient, University of Michigan Health-West \neasily could have permitted Ms. Kloosterman to continue that practice. \n148.  University of Michigan Health-Westโs supervisory practices for employees like \nMs. Kloosterman provide further evidence that it easily could have accommodated her.   \n149.  Because Ms. Kloostermanโs title was Physician Assistant, and because she was not \na supervising physician, there were certain tasks that were considered outside her range of \nexpertise.  \n150.  Physician assistants at the clinic had specific responsibilities, but they possessed \nonly as much authority as their supervising physicians felt comfortable giving to them. \n151.  For example, Advanced Practice Providers such as Ms. Kloosterman were either \nnot allowed to prescribe controlled substances or could prescribe them only with a supervisorโs \napproval.   \n152.  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  could  easily  have  accommodated  Ms. \nKloostermanโs religious beliefs by allowing her supervising physician to meet with any patients \nwho wished to receive referrals for โgender reassignmentโ drugs or procedures.  \n153.  While Ms. Kloosterman cared for many patients regularly over the course of her \ncareer and had many patients specifically request to see her, she was not formally listed as anyoneโs \nโprimary care providerโ because of her status as a physician assistant. Thus, every patient she saw \n  23 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.24   Filed 10/11/22   Page 24 of 56\nalso had a primary care provider that he or she could have easily seen to discuss โgender \nreassignmentโ drugs or procedures. \n154.  The other providers at the Metro Health Caledonia clinic would also often exercise \ntheir medical judgment to say no to requests that patients may have, when the providers believed \nthat such requests were medically inappropriate or not in the patientโs best interest.  \n155.  For example, many patients would ask for narcotics, and the providers would send \nthem to a pain clinic instead.  But if they refused to go and came back asking for medication refills, \nthe provider would sometimes say no because he or she was concerned that the patient was \nbecoming dependent on highly addictive medications.  \n156.  If a patient asked for psychiatric medication refills but was not willing to follow up \nwith a psychiatrist for the care that he or she needed, that was another situation where a provider \nmight exercise his or her medical judgment to say no to the patientโs request.  \n157.  If a patient asked for a referral to a surgeon when the provider thought that surgery \nwas not necessary, the provider would make very clear that he or she did not think a referral was \nmedically appropriate.  It would be the providerโs decision whether to make the referral at that \npoint.   \n158.  Referrals are much more than just checking a box.  They require thoughtful \nconsideration and are an exercise of the providerโs independent medical judgment in agreeing that \nthe referral is necessary and appropriate.  \n159.  At the time Ms. Kloosterman was working at the clinic, only administrative office \nstaff had the ability to change the sex or gender templated fields on patientsโ medical records.  \nMedical providers, including Ms. Kloosterman, did not have that ability.  Since Ms. Kloosterman \nwas fired, however, the policy has changed so that medical providers are able to make those \nchanges. \n160.  In any event, in the rare instances when its pronoun policy might have had \napplication to Ms. Kloostermanโs duties, University of Michigan Health-West easily could have \n  24 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.25   Filed 10/11/22   Page 25 of 56\naccommodated her by allowing her to use patientsโ names instead of biology-obscuring pronouns, \nas she had done in the past without any incident or patient complaint. \nMs. Kloostermanโs Religious Beliefs Are Shared by Thousands of Medical Professionals \n161.  Thousands of religious healthcare professionals share Ms. Kloostermanโs views, \nwhich are grounded in both her religious faith and her medical judgment. \n162.  Ms. Kloosterman is a member of the Christian Medical and Dental Association \n(โCMDAโ), which is an organization of over 19,000 Christian healthcare professionals.  \n163.  CMDAโs position statement on transgender identification is attached as Exhibit I. \n164.  CMDA believes that โhealthcare professionals should not be forced to violate their \nconscientious commitment to their patientsโ health and welfare by being required to accept and \nparticipate in harmful gender-transition interventions, especially on the young and vulnerable.โ  \nId.  \n165.  โCMDA affirms the obligation of Christian healthcare professionals caring for \npatients struggling with gender identity to do so with sensitivity and compassion, consistent with \nthe humility and love that Jesus modeled and commanded us to show all people.โ  Id. \n166.  โCMDA holds that attempts to radically reconstruct oneโs body surgically or \nhormonally for psychological indications, however, are medically, ethically, and psychologically \ninappropriate.  These measures alter healthy tissue and increasingly are not supported by scientific \nresearch evaluating behavioral, medical, and surgical outcomes.โ  Id. \nMs. Kloostermanโs Medical Judgment Is Supported by Scientific Research \n167.  Given her beliefs regarding human sexuality, Ms. Kloosterman believes that it \nwould be sinful to prescribe or give referrals for โpuberty blockers,โ โhormone therapy,โ or \nโgender reassignment surgery,โ regardless of what medical benefit those drugs and procedures \nmight bring.  She believes likewise with respect to the use of biology-obscuring pronouns.  \n168.  However, as explained above, Ms. Kloosterman also believes that it would be \ndishonest and sinful to violate her conscience and Hippocratic oath by knowingly facilitating a \n  25 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.26   Filed 10/11/22   Page 26 of 56\ndrug or procedure thatโin her independent medical judgmentโwill bring to a patient more harm \nthan benefit, and by using biology-obscuring pronouns that place patients at risk of missing \nimportant, sex-specific screenings.  That others might reach a different conclusion on these matters \ndoes not relieve Ms. Kloosterman of her religious duty to honor her conscience, her oath, and her \nduty to compassionately care for her patients by honestly following her studied and independent \nmedical judgment. \n169.  Ms. Kloostermanโs studied and independent medical judgment is that referring \npatients for โpuberty blockers,โ โhormone therapy,โ or โgender reassignment surgeryโ would \ncause more harm than benefit.  Her medical judgment counsels the same conclusion with respect \nto using pronouns that obscure or misrepresent a patientโs biological sex. \n170.  Ms. Kloostermanโs medical judgments find support in relevant scientific literature. \n171.  A growing body of scientific literature documents the significance of biological sex \nfor effective medical treatment.  According to the Endocrine Society in 2021, โ[d]iseases that affect \nboth sexes often have different frequencies, presentations, and responses to treatments in males \nand females; therefore, different preventative, diagnostic, and treatment approaches may be \nrequired for males and females.โ4 \n172.  For  this  reason,  Ms.  Kloosterman  is  concerned  that  using  biology-obscuring \npronouns could cause patients to miss health-supporting or even life-saving screenings such as \nmammograms, pregnancy tests, prostate exams, and exams for sexually-transmitted diseases that \ndiffer based on biological sex. Using biology-obscuring pronouns could also result in potentially \ninappropriate prescriptions, such as medications that are harmful during pregnancy.   \n173.  International studies make clear that the overwhelming majority of patients with \ngender dysphoria are also suffering from underlying mental health issues, adverse childhood \nevents,  neuro-developmental  problems,  and  family  issues.    This  is  especially  prevalent  in \n \n4 Aditi Bhargava, Arthur P Arnold, Debra A Bangasser, Kate M Denton, Arpana Gupta, Lucinda M Hilliard \nKrause, Emeran A Mayer, Margaret McCarthy, Walter L Miller, Armin Raznahan, Ragini Verma, Considering Sex \nas a Biological Variable in Basic and Clinical Studies: An Endocrine Society Scientific Statement, ENDOCRINE \nREVIEWS, Vol. 42, No. 3 (June 2021), pp. 219โ258, https://doi.org/10.1210/endrev/bnaa034. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.27   Filed 10/11/22   Page 27 of 56\nadolescents.  A 2018 parental survey found that 62.5% of gender dysphoric adolescents had โa \npsychiatric disorder or neurodevelopmental disability (before) the onset of gender dysphoria,โ and \n48.4% had experienced a traumatic or stressful prior event.5 \n174.   Medical literature reports that prematurely affirming a patientโs perceived gender \nidentity is unhelpful and can cause harm to sexual minority patients.  According to the American \nPsychiatric Association and multiple scientific studies, for minors with gender dysphoria, an \naverage of 85% of the cases resolve by adulthoodโunless the perceived gender identity is affirmed \nand puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or other interventions are done.6 \n175.  According to the APA Handbook on Sexuality and Psychology: โPremature labeling \nof gender identity should be avoided.โ โThis approach runs the risk of neglecting individual \nproblems the child might be experiencing. . . .โ โAn adolescentโs gender identity concerns must \nnot become a reason for failure to address all her/his other relevant problems in the usual way.โ7 \n176.

The medical research does not show that cross-sex hormones or sex-obscuring \nsurgery decreases the likelihood of suicide.  A 2020 study by Brรคnstrรถm and Pachankis, claiming \nto be the first total population study of 9.7 million Swedish residents, ultimately showed neither \nโgender-affirming hormone treatmentโ nor โgender-affirming surgeryโ improved mental health \nbenchmarks, including suicide rates.15 \n182.  Given this research, the lack of medical consensus about how best to treat gender \ndysphoria, and the growing international consensus that mandatory affirmation of a patientโs \nperceived gender identity, cross-sex hormones, and โgender transitionโ procedures cause more \nharm than good, Ms. Kloostermanโs medical judgment is well-founded and well-documented. \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nDefendants Pai, Booker, Cole, Pierce, and Smith,  \nin Both Their Official and Individual Capacities \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments: Free Exercise of Religion \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n \n183.

When โโofficial expressions of hostilityโ to religion accompany laws or policies \nburdening religious exercise . . . the Court has โset aside such policies without further inquiry.โโ  \nKennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist. 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2422 n.1 (2022) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop, \nLtd. v. Colo. Civil Rights Commโn, 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1732 (2018)). \n187.  The unanimous Supreme Court has held that โ[g]overnment fails to act neutrally \nwhen it proceeds in a manner intolerant of religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their \nreligious nature.โ  Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021). \n188.  Under the First Amendment, the government โcannot impose regulations that are \nhostile to the religious beliefs of affected citizens and cannot act in a manner that passes judgment \nupon or presupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices.โ  Masterpiece Cakeshop, \nLtd. v. Colorado Civ. Rights Commโn, 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1731-32 (2018) (commissioner violated \nFree Exercise Clause when he called cake shop ownerโs faith โdespicableโ and โmerely rhetoricalโ; \nthis demonstrated โa clear and impermissible hostility toward [his] sincere religious beliefsโ). \n189.  Defendants  violated  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment,  as \nincorporated against the states via the Fourteenth Amendment, when they openly mocked and \ncondemned Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs or tacitly approved of or shared their colleaguesโ \nanimus toward Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs. \n190.  Defendants expressed and harbored even more unconstitutional religious animus \nagainst Ms. Kloosterman than the animus that the Court sharply condemned in Masterpiece \nCakeshop. \n191.  Defendants have expressly stated or adopted views hostile to the religious faith of \nMs. Kloosterman and acted pursuant to such hostile views.  These views include Defendant \nPierceโs statements that Ms. Kloosterman is โevilโ because of her religious beliefs, that she is a \nโliar,โ that she cannot bring the Bible or her beliefs to work with her, and that she is to blame for \ngender-dysphoria-related suicides.  \n192.  The other Defendants did not disavow any of these hostile statements, and on \ninformation and belief, they share the anti-religious animus that Defendant Pierce made explicit.  \n  30 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.31   Filed 10/11/22   Page 31 of 56\n193.  In the termination letter, Defendants also falsely accused Ms. Kloosterman of \naltering templated pronouns on patientsโ medical records, see Exhibit H, even though she had \nexplained that she was unable to do so because only office staff could make such changes.  \n194.  This newly fabricated and baseless accusation is further evidence of animus toward \nMs. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs. \n195.  The tarnishing of Ms. Kloostermanโs reputation and concealment of the facts \nsurrounding her termination during the August 25, 2021, mandatory staff meeting are further \nevidence of animus toward Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs. \n196.  Defendants  have  unconstitutionally  targeted  Ms.  Kloosterman  for  disparate \ntreatment because of her religious beliefs.  See Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 537 (1993). \n197.  In accordance with these views, Defendants have targeted Ms. Kloosterman for \ndisparate treatment, including by their refusal to accommodate her religious beliefs and their \ndecision  to  terminate  her  because  of  her  religious  beliefs,  despite  having  written  policies \nprohibiting religious discrimination.16 \n198.  Defendantsโ actions reflect animus toward Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs. \n199.  Defendantsโ discriminatory treatment has exposed Ms. Kloosterman to substantial \nconsequences for her religious exercise, including the loss of her job, the disruption of her career, \nlost wages and benefits, and loss of reputation, because of Defendantsโ hostility and animus toward \nher religious beliefs. \n200.  Defendants targeted Ms. Kloosterman for termination because she requested an \naccommodation for her religious beliefs.  \n \n16  See,  e.g.,  โNon  Discrimination  Notice,โ  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  (2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/EH37-ZBCZ (โUniversity of Michigan Health-West complies with applicable Federal civil rights \nlaws and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex.

Defendants also violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, as \nincorporated  against  the  states  via  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  when  they  granted  secular \naccommodations to other employees regarding common drugs and medical procedures while \nfailing to grant a religious accommodation to Ms. Kloosterman regarding much more rare drugs \nand medical procedures.  \n202.  Under the First Amendment, government policies and practices that substantially \nburden the free exercise of religion are subject to strict scrutiny unless they are neutral and \ngenerally applicable.  See Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, \n531โ32 (1993).  \n203.  A government policy or practice โis not neutral and generally applicable if it invites \nthe government to consider the particular reasons for a personโs conduct by providing a mechanism \nfor individualized exemptions.โ  Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021). \n204.  A government policy or practice is not neutral and generally applicable when it \ntreats secular conduct more favorably than religious exercise.  See Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. \n1294, 1296 (2021) (regulations โtrigger strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause, whenever \nthey treat any comparable secular activity more favorably than religious exerciseโ); Kennedy v. \nBremerton Sch. Dist. 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2422 (2022). \n205.  Under the Free Exercise Clause, โdenying a generally available benefit solely on \naccount of religious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that can be justified \nonly by a state interest โof the highest order.โโ  Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. \nComer, 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2019 (2017) (quoting McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S. 618, 628 (1978)). \n206.  Defendants have created categorical exemptions and individualized exemptions \nfrom their policies and procedures that accommodate other providersโ non-religious objections.  \n207.  Defendants  easily  accommodate  other  medical  professionals  who  have  non-\nreligious objections to far more common procedures, and these accommodations often shield the \nobjecting professionals from having to make referrals.  \n  32 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.33   Filed 10/11/22   Page 33 of 56\n208.  For  example,  a  male  provider  who  did  not  wish  to  perform  female  pelvic \nexaminations was not scheduled to see those patients.  Likewise, doctors unwilling to perform \ntoenail removals or prescribe diet pills were not scheduled to see patients requesting those services.  \nAnd a provider who refused to prescribe opioids was permitted to tell patients that opioids are \nclinically unnecessary or that he does not prescribe them, without referring patients to another \nprovider.  Even when patients specifically requested referrals for services that providers thought \nmedically inappropriate, providers could refuse the referral request and instead discuss other \ntreatment options.  \n209.  Thus,  Defendants  respect  the  secular  consciences  and  independent  medical \njudgment of University of Michigan Health-Westโs other health care providers relating to common \ndrugs and proceduresโbut not the religious conscience and independent medical judgment of Ms. \nKloosterman, which relate to rarely performed procedures and rarely prescribed drugs.  \n210.  Ms. Kloostermanโs sincerely held religious beliefs require her to abstain from using \nbiology-obscuring  pronouns,  prescribing  cross-sex  hormones,  or  referring  for  โgender \nreassignmentโ surgeries.  Her compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise.  \n211.  Defendantsโ policies and practices of accommodating non-religious preferences of \nother  providers  while  denying  religious  accommodations  to  Ms.  Kloosterman;  of  silencing \nemployees who hold religious beliefs about gender and sexuality that are contrary to its own \nagenda; and of interfering with the independent medical judgment of its professional medical \nemployees by requiring them to prescribe, recommend, or give referral for โgender transitionโ \ndrugs and procedures based on University of Michigan Health-Westโs view of gender and sexuality \nrather than the best interest of the patient as determined by the providerโs independent medical \njudgment, are not neutral, and these policies and practices were the moving force of the violation \nof Ms. Kloostermanโs right to the free exercise of religion. \n212.  Defendantsโ policies and practices of accommodating non-religious preferences of \nother  providers  while  denying  religious  accommodations  to  Ms.  Kloosterman;  of  silencing \nemployees who hold religious beliefs about gender and sexuality that are contrary to its own \n  33 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.34   Filed 10/11/22   Page 34 of 56\nagenda; and of interfering with the independent medical judgment of its professional medical \nemployees by requiring them to prescribe, recommend, or give referral for โgender transitionโ \ndrugs and procedures based on University of Michigan Health-Westโs view of gender and sexuality \nrather than the best interest of the patient as determined by the providerโs independent medical \njudgment, are not generally applicable, and these policies and practices were the moving force of \nthe violation of Ms. Kloostermanโs right to the free exercise of religion.  \n213.  Under Fulton and Tandon, Defendantsโ willingness to accommodate for secular \nreasons but not religious reasons triggers strict scrutiny.  \n214.  Defendantsโ myriad secular exceptions for far more common drugs and procedures \nundermine any argument that they must deny similar accommodations to Ms. Kloosterman for far \nmore rare drugs and procedures.  As in Fulton, โ[t]he creation of a system of exceptions under the \ncontract undermine[d] the Cityโs contention that its non-discrimination policies can brook no \ndepartures.โ  141 S. Ct. at 1882. \n215.  Defendantsโ  discriminatory  treatment  and  selective  accommodation  practices \ncreate government-imposed coercive pressure on Ms. Kloosterman to change or violate her \nreligious beliefs. \n216.  Defendantsโ discriminatory treatment chills Ms. Kloostermanโs religious exercise.  \n217.  Defendantsโ discriminatory treatment has exposed Ms. Kloosterman to substantial \nconsequences for her religious exercise, including but not limited to the loss of her job, the \ndisruption of her career, lost wages and benefits, and loss of reputation. \n218.  Because of her religion, Defendants denied Ms. Kloosterman an accommodation \nthat they would have afforded for comparable non-religious expression and conduct.  \n219.  Despite being informed in detail of Ms. Kloostermanโs beliefs, Defendants declined \nto give her accommodations that would allow her to comply both with her beliefs and Michigan \nHealthโs policies. \n220.  Defendants have no legitimate basis for denying Ms. Kloosterman a religious \naccommodation. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.35   Filed 10/11/22   Page 35 of 56\n221.  Defendants have no compelling interest in their violations of Ms. Kloostermanโs \nreligious exercise.  Even if there were a compelling government interest, Defendants have not \nshown that their actions are the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. \n222.  Defendantsโ actions, taken under color of state law, have denied Ms. Kloosterman \nrights and privileges secured under the U.S. Constitutionโs First Amendment, as applied to the \nstates through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Because of Defendantsโ actions, Ms. Kloosterman has \nsuffered, and continues to suffer, economic injury and irreparable harm.  She is entitled to an award \nof equitable relief. \n223.  Pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1983  and  1988,  Ms.  Kloosterman  is  entitled  to  a \ndeclaration that Defendants violated her right under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to free \nexercise of religion, to an order against Defendants directing them to reinstate Ms. Kloosterman, \nand an injunction prohibiting future such acts by Defendants.  Additionally, Ms. Kloosterman is \nentitled to the reasonable costs of this lawsuit, including her reasonable attorneysโ fees.  \n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nDefendants Pai, Booker, Cole, Pierce, and Smith,  \nin Both Their Official and Individual Capacities \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments: Freedom of Speech \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n224.

Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 \n(1943) (โIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or \n  35 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.36   Filed 10/11/22   Page 36 of 56\npetty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of \nopinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.โ). \n228.  Government officials may not condition a public benefit on affirming or abjuring a \nspecific set of beliefs or policy statement.  Agency for Int'l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc., \n570 U.S. 205, 218 (2013) (โBy requiring recipients to profess a specific belief, the Policy \nRequirement goes beyond defining the limits of the federally funded program to defining the \nrecipient.โ). \n229.  The government cannot compel individuals to mouth support for views that they \nfind objectionable, because this violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  See \nJanus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, 138 S. Ct. \n2448, 2463 (2018). \n230.  The Supreme Court reiterated this principle in National Institute of Family and Life \nAdvocates (NIFLA) v. Becerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361, 2371 (2018), ruling that the pro-abortion notice \nrequirement  imposed  on  pregnancy  resource  clinics  was  an  unconstitutional  content-based \nrestriction on speech, and concluding that the California law at issue there was โa paradigmatic \nexample of the serious threat presented when government seeks to impose its own message in the \nplace of individual speech, thought, and expression.โ  \n231.  A public university may not censor speech that the First Amendment protects. \nDambrot v. Central Michigan University, 55 F.3d 1177, 1182-84 (6th Cir. 1995); Doe v. Univ. of \nMichigan, 721 F. Supp. 852, 863 (E.D. Mich. 1989) (โWhat the University could not do, however, \nwas establish an anti-discrimination policy which had the effect of prohibiting certain speech \nbecause it disagreed with ideas or messages sought to be conveyed.โ). \n232.  Because the government cannot compel people to support messages that they \ndisagree with or that violate their convictions, requiring the use of preferred pronouns is compelled \nspeech that violates the First Amendment.  And this is no less true with respect to government \ncompulsion of its employees than for government compulsion of other citizens.  \n  36 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.37   Filed 10/11/22   Page 37 of 56\n233.  In the Sixth Circuit, public universities violate the First Amendment when they \ncoerce their employees to use sex-obscuring pronouns while performing job duties that require \nfreedom of expression.  See Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492 (6th Cir. 2021) (holding that a \npublic university violated a professorโs freedom of speech when it compelled him to speak against \nhis conscience by addressing students with gender-identity-based pronouns).  In that context, the \ngeneral rule of Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006) does not apply.  See Meriwether, 992 \nF.3d at 505โ07.  \n234.  Instead, the Sixth Circuit heeds the First Amendmentโs fundamental command that \nโthe government โmay not compel affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees.โโ  \nMeriwether, 992 F.3d at 503 (quoting Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Bos., \n515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995)). \n235.  Just as the academic enterprise is inconsistent with a speech code for professors, \nsee Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 507โ12, the practice of medicine is inconsistent with a speech code \nfor medical professionals.  \n236.  The stakes are much higher in medicine than in the university context.  When \nuniversities coerce professors to use sex-obscuring pronouns, the consequences are โideological \nconformityโ and a loss of the free exchange of ideas.  Id. at 506.  But when universities coerce \nmedical professionals to use sex-obscuring pronouns, the consequences can be confusion over a \npatientโs biological sex and missed life-saving screenings such as mammograms, testicular exams, \nand pregnancy tests, or potentially inappropriate prescriptions, such as medications that are \nharmful during pregnancy.  Therefore, by conditioning Ms. Kloostermanโs employment on the use \nof biology-obscuring pronouns, University of Michigan Health-West violated her freedom of \nspeech. \n237.  Defendantsโ actions violate Ms. Kloostermanโs right to be free from compelled \nspeech as secured to her by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  \nDefendantsโ policies and practices of silencing employees who hold religious beliefs about gender \nand sexuality that are contrary to its own agenda; of maintaining a speech code whereby providers \n  37 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.38   Filed 10/11/22   Page 38 of 56\nand employees may not use pronouns associated with a patientโs biological sex if the patient \nprefers different pronouns, of requiring employees to use pronouns as preferred by patients; and \nof maintaining a speech code that allows for hecklerโs vetoes of medical providersโ speech, were \nthe moving force of Defendantsโ violation of Ms. Kloostermanโs right to be free from compelled \nspeech. \n238.  Defendantsโ speech code violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nbecause it is content and viewpoint based, overbroad, and vague.  \n239.  Defendants have no compelling interest in their attempt to compel Ms. Kloosterman \nto speak messages that she disagrees with or else lose her job.  Even if there were a compelling \ngovernment interest, Defendants have not shown that their actions are the least restrictive means \nof achieving that interest. \n240.  Defendantsโ actions, taken under color of state law, have denied Ms. Kloosterman \nrights and privileges secured under the U.S. Constitutionโs First Amendment as applied to the \nstates through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Because of Defendantsโ actions, Ms. Kloosterman has \nsuffered, and continues to suffer, economic injury and irreparable harm.  She is entitled to an award \nof equitable relief. \n241.  Pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1983  and  1988,  Ms.  Kloosterman  is  entitled  to  a \ndeclaration that Defendants violated her First and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from \nbeing compelled to speak a message with which she disagrees and an injunction prohibiting future \nsuch acts by Defendants.  Additionally, Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to an order against Defendants \ndirecting them to reinstate Ms. Kloosterman, and to the reasonable costs of this lawsuit, including \nher reasonable attorneysโ fees. \n \n  38 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.39   Filed 10/11/22   Page 39 of 56\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nDefendants Pai, Booker, Cole, Pierce, and Smith,  \nin Both Their Official and Individual Capacities \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment: Equal Protection \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n \n242.  Ms.  Kloosterman  incorporates  and  adopts  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the \npreceding paragraphs of the Amended Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n243.  Ms. Kloosterman brings this cause of action against Defendants Pai, Booker, Cole, \nPierce, and Smith, in both their individual and official capacities. \n244.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides, inter alia, that no \nstate shall โdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ U.S. Const., \nAmend. XIV. \n245.  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion. \n246.  Under the Equal Protection Clause, government officials may not treat someone \ndifferently as compared to similarly situated persons, when such disparate treatment burdens the \nexercise of a fundamental right such as the First Amendmentโs free exercise of religion and \nfreedom of speech. \n247.  Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause by intentionally discriminating \nagainst Ms. Kloosterman because of her religion.  \n248.  Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause by refusing to accommodate Ms. \nKloostermanโs religious beliefs while providing numerous accommodations for other employeesโ \nnon-religious preferences.  Defendantsโ policies and practices of accommodating non-religious \npreferences of other providers while denying religious accommodations to Ms. Kloosterman; of \nsilencing employees who hold religious beliefs about gender and sexuality that are contrary to its \nown agenda; and of interfering with the independent medical judgment of its professional medical \nemployees by requiring them to prescribe, recommend, or give referral for โgender transitionโ \ndrugs and procedures based on University of Michigan Health-Westโs view of gender and sexuality \nrather than the best interest of the patient as determined by the providerโs independent medical \n  39 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.40   Filed 10/11/22   Page 40 of 56\njudgment, were the moving force of Defendantsโ violation of Ms. Kloostermanโs right to enjoy \nequal protection of the laws. \n249.  By treating Ms. Kloosterman differently on the basis of a suspect classification, \nreligion, and by violating her fundamental rights, the Defendantsโ actions trigger strict scrutiny.  \n250.  Defendantsโ actions in discriminating against Ms. Kloosterman were not narrowly \ntailored to serve a compelling governmental interest, nor did they use the least restrictive means \nwhen they refused to grant her an accommodation and terminated her instead. \n251.  Defendantsโ actions, taken under color of state law, have denied Ms. Kloosterman \nrights and privileges secured under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Because \nof Defendantsโ actions, Ms. Kloosterman has suffered, and continues to suffer, economic injury \nand irreparable harm.  She is entitled to an award of equitable relief. \n252.  Pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1983  and  1988,  Ms.  Kloosterman  is  entitled  to  a \ndeclaration that Defendants violated her Fourteenth Amendment right to enjoy the equal protection \nof the laws and an injunction prohibiting future such acts by Defendants.  Additionally, Ms. \nKloosterman  is  entitled  to  an  order  against  Defendants  directing  them  to  reinstate  Ms. \nKloosterman, and to the reasonable costs of this lawsuit, including her reasonable attorneysโ fees. \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nDefendant Metropolitan Hospital, d/b/a University of Michigan Health-West \nViolation of Title VII: Religious Discrimination, Disparate Treatment \n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e \n253.  Ms.  Kloosterman  incorporates  and  adopts  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the \npreceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n254.  Ms.  Kloosterman  brings  this  cause  of  action  against  Defendant  Metropolitan \nHospital, d/b/a University of Michigan-Health West. \n255.  University of Michigan Health-West is an employer within the meaning of Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(b). \n256.  Under Title VII, it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer โto \ndischarge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his \n  40 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.41   Filed 10/11/22   Page 41 of 56\n[or  her]  compensation,  terms,  conditions,  or  privileges  of  employment,  because  of  such \nindividualโs ... religion.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a)(1). \n257.  โReligionโ is defined as including โall aspects of religious observance and practice, \nas well as belief.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(j). \n258.  The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission defines โreligious practicesโ to \nโinclude moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the \nstrength of traditional religious views.โ  29 C.F.R. ยง 1605.1. \n259.  โ[R]eligious practice is one of the protected characteristics that cannot be accorded \ndisparate treatment and must be accommodated.โ  EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 \nU.S 768, 774-75 (2015).  \n260.  University of Michigan Health-West violated Title VII when it terminated Ms. \nKloosterman because of her sincerely-held religious beliefs and failed to provide her a reasonable \nreligious accommodation. \n261.  Ms. Kloosterman is a devout Christian who holds biblically-based, traditional \nChristian beliefs that God created humans in His image as male and female, and that male and \nfemale are defined by biological difference between the sexes. \n262.  Ms. Kloosterman was an outstanding employee, well-qualified for her position and \nbeloved by her patients and coworkers.  No complaints were ever raised about her performance.  \n263.  University of Michigan Health-West violated Title VII when it terminated Ms. \nKloosterman because of her religious beliefs and exercise.  \n264.  University of Michigan Health-West staff made very clear to Ms. Kloosterman at \nthe HR and DEI meetings that its reason for questioning her and terminating her was her religious \nbeliefs, even going so far as to mock and deride her religious beliefs.  \n265.  The letter explaining her termination also made this clear, listing three reasons for \nfiring Ms. Kloosterman, all of which directly related to her sincerely held religious beliefs about \ngender identity and her conscientious objection to assisting in the provision of certain โgender \nreassignmentโ drugs and procedures.  Exhibit H. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.42   Filed 10/11/22   Page 42 of 56\n266.  If not for Ms. Kloostermanโs religious beliefs about gender and sexuality, she \nwould not have been fired.  Thus, religion was a but-for cause of her termination.  Bostock, 140 S. \nCt. at 1739.  \n267.  If Ms. Kloosterman had not disclosed her religious beliefs about gender and \nsexuality and requested a religious accommodation, she would not have been fired.  Thus, religion \nwas a but-for cause of her termination. \n268.  In  the  alternative,  religion  was  a  motivating  factor  in  Ms.  Kloostermanโs \ntermination.  \n269.  University  of  Michigan  Health-Westโs  officialsโ  hostile  statements  to  Ms. \nKloosterman constitute direct evidence of discrimination in violation of Title VII. \n270.  Title VII demands more than โmere neutrality with regard to religious practicesโ \nbut requires โfavored treatment, affirmatively obligating employers not โto fail or refuse to hire or \ndischarge any individual . . . because of such individualโs โreligious observance and practice.โโ  \nAbercrombie, 575 U.S. at 775.  \n271.  Employers are affirmatively required to โreasonably accommodateโ an employeeโs \nreligious beliefs, observances, and practices unless the accommodation would pose an โundue \nhardship on the conduct of the employerโs business.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(j).  \n272.  An employeeโs โsincerely heldโ religious objection to a workplace policy or job \nduty qualifies for a religious accommodation.  EEOC Religion Guidance ยง 12- I-A-2 (citing United \nStates v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 184-85 (1965)); EEOC Religion Guidelines, 29 C.F.R. ยง 1605.2.  \n273.  The  burden  is  on  the  employer  to  โdemonstrateโ  undue  hardship  based  on \nโobjective information,โ not hypothetical concerns, to show that the burden is more than โde \nminimis.โ  EEOC Religion Guidance ยง 12-IV-B-1.  \n274.  If an employer grants accommodations for non-religious reasons but not religious \nreasons, this gives rise to an inference of pretextual religious discrimination.  Ansonia Bd. of Educ. \nv. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 71 (1986) (โunpaid leave is not a reasonable accommodation when paid \n  42 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.43   Filed 10/11/22   Page 43 of 56\nleave is provided for all purposes except religious ones . . . . [because] [s]uch an arrangement \nwould display a discrimination against religious practices that is the antithesis of reasonablenessโ). \n275.  Under  Title  VII,  Ms.  Kloosterman  was  entitled  to  a  reasonable  religious \naccommodation. \n276.  University of Michigan Health-West violated Title VII when it failed to provideโ\nor even to considerโreasonable accommodations that would respect Ms. Kloostermanโs religious \nbeliefs.  \n277.  University of Michigan Health-West did not grant Ms. Kloosterman the reasonable \nreligious accommodation that she was entitled to by Title VII, but instead denigrated her religious \nbeliefs and then summarily terminated her.  \n278.  Yet  multiple  reasonable  accommodations  could  have  permitted  University  of \nMichigan  Health-West  to  pursue  its  interests  while  respecting  Ms.  Kloostermanโs  beliefs: \npermitting the use of patientsโ names in place of pronouns, which she had previously done without \nincident, scheduling other providers to see patients when they seek โgender reassignmentโ drugs \nor procedures, or posting a written notice to all patients allowing them to obtain referrals for any \nmissed services by calling a phone number for the Wyoming or Ann Arbor hospitals.  \n279.  As  described  above,  supra  ยถยถ  135-160,  University  of  Michigan  Health-West \naccommodated the independent medical judgment and secular objections of other providers in Ms. \nKloostermanโs office but refused to accommodate her independent medical judgment and religious \nconscience concerning much rarer drugs and procedures.  \n280.  This  practice  of  granting  accommodations  for  non-religious  reasons  but  not \nreligious reasons constitutes religious discrimination under Ansonia Board of Education, 479 U.S. \nat 71. \n281.  Any  concerns  from  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  about  potential \ndisruptions to patient service were merely hypothetical, and a myriad of potential accommodations \nexisted,  as  shown  by  University  of  Michigan  Health-Westโs  ability  to  accommodate  other \n  43 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.44   Filed 10/11/22   Page 44 of 56\nemployeesโ secular objections toโand independent medical judgments concerningโfar more \ncommon drugs and procedures. \n282.  University of Michigan Health-Westโs conduct constitutes discrimination on the \nbasis of religion under 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a) and 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(m). \n283.  Because of University of Michigan Health-Westโs actions, Ms. Kloosterman has \nsuffered, and continues to suffer, economic injury and irreparable harm.  She is entitled to an award \nof monetary damages and equitable relief. \n284.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(g), Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to a declaration \nthat University of Michigan Health-West violated her right to be free from religious discrimination \nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a) and 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(m) and an injunction against University of \nMichigan Health-West to prohibit future such acts.  Additionally, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-\n5(g) and (k), Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to reinstatement, backpay and front pay with interest, \nvalue of lost benefits, actual and nominal damages, costs, and attorneysโ fees.  \n285.  University of Michigan Health-Westโs conduct was intentional, and it acted with \nmalice, oppression, or reckless indifference to the protected rights of Ms. Kloosterman.  She is \nthus entitled to punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a. \n \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nDefendant Metropolitan Hospital, d/b/a University of Michigan Health-West \nViolation of Title VII: Religious Discrimination, Disparate Impact \n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e \n286.  Ms.  Kloosterman  incorporates  and  adopts  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the \npreceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n287.  Ms.  Kloosterman  brings  this  cause  of  action  against  Defendant  Metropolitan \nHospital, d/b/a University of Michigan-Health West. \n288.  University of Michigan Health-West is an employer within the meaning of Title \nVII. 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(b). \n  44 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.45   Filed 10/11/22   Page 45 of 56\n289.  Under Title VII, it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer โto limit, \nsegregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive \nor tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his \nstatus as an employee, because of such individualโs ... religion.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a)(2); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(k). \n290.  University of Michigan Health-West has the following nondiscrimination policy: \nโUniversity of Michigan Health-West complies with applicable Federal civil rights laws and does \nnot discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex.  UM Health-\nWest does not exclude people or treat them differently because of race, color, national origin, age, \ndisability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion.โ17  \n291.  University of Michigan Health-West violated its own policy when it excluded Ms. \nKloosterman and treated her differently because of her religion.  \n292.  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  had  a  policy  or  practice  of  disciplining \nemployees for expressing, mentioning, or suggesting that they hold traditional beliefs on issues \nrelated to sexual morality, sexual orientation, or gender identity. \n293.  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  maintained  a  rule  against  respecting \nindependent  medical  judgment  on  โgender  reassignmentโ  treatments,  which  rule \ndisproportionately impacts those with traditional religious beliefs concerning sex and gender. \n294.  University of Michigan Health-Westโs practice of respecting medical judgment on \nmyriad  treatment  issues  but  not  on  โgender  reassignmentโ  treatments  disparately  impacts \nemployees with traditional religious beliefs about the biological differences between the sexes.  \nSee Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971); 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(k). \n295.

Less discriminatory alternatives existed to achieve Defendantsโ stated business \npurposes, including but not limited to permitting the use of patientsโ names in place of pronouns, \nwhich Ms. Kloosterman had previously done without incident, scheduling other providers to see \npatients when they seek โgender reassignmentโ drugs or procedures, or posting a written notice to \nall patients allowing them to obtain referrals for any missed services by calling a phone number \nfor the Wyoming or Ann Arbor hospitals. \n297.  This policy has a disparate impact on religious employees and Christian employees, \nincluding Ms. Kloosterman. \n298.  This policy has a disparate impact on employees like Ms. Kloosterman with \ntraditional religious views on sex or gender. \n299.  As a direct, legal and proximate result of the discrimination, Ms. Kloosterman has \nsustained, and will continue to sustain, economic injuries, resulting in damages in an amount to be \nproven at trial. \n300.  Because  of  University  of  Michigan  Health-Westโs  policies  and  actions,  Ms. \nKloosterman has suffered, and continues to suffer, economic injury and irreparable harm.

This test examines whether the partyโs belief is โsincerely heldโ and โreligious in \nnature,โ whether the state has โimposed a burdenโ on that religious belief or exercise, whether a \nโcompelling state interest justifies the burden,โ and โwhether there is a less obtrusive form of \nregulation available to the state.โ  Id. (citing Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 214โ30 (1972)).  \n  47 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.48   Filed 10/11/22   Page 48 of 56\n308.  Here, under the Michigan Supreme Courtโs compelling-interest test, there is no \nquestion that Ms. Kloostermanโs beliefs are sincerely held and religious in nature. \n309.  Defendants  substantially  burdened  Ms.  Kloostermanโs  religious  exercise  by \ndenigrating her religion, refusing to provide an accommodation, attempting to coerce her to violate \nher religious convictions, and ultimately terminating her because of her religious beliefs. \n310.  Defendants  cannot  show  a  compelling  interest  in  imposing  these  substantial \nburdens, and less intrusive solutions abound. \n311.  During Ms. Kloostermanโs 17 years of employment by University of Michigan \nHealth-West, no patient ever asked her for a referral for โgender reassignment surgeryโ or other \nrelated drugs or procedures.  Nor did any patient ask her to use gender-identity-based pronouns.  \n312.  Defendants therefore cannot show that it is likely Ms. Kloosterman ever would be \nplaced in a situation calling for such referrals or pronouns. \n313.  But even if they could show that such a situation would arise, Defendants could \nhave granted any of several possible accommodations, such as allowing the use of patientsโ names \ninstead of pronouns, modifying Ms. Kloostermanโs schedule for patient visits to obviate the need \nfor  any  referrals  (as  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  does  for  employees  with  secular \nobjections to far more common drugs and procedures), or posting notices that allow patients to \ncall the Wyoming or Ann Arbor hospitals for referrals. \n314.  The absence of any past incident and the availability of these accommodations \npreclude Defendants from justifying their substantial burdens on Ms. Kloostermanโs religious \nexercise.    Thus,  Defendantsโ  actions  and  policies  violated  Article  I,  ยง  4  of  the  Michigan \nConstitution. \n315.  Punishing Ms. Kloosterman for her religious beliefs is not narrowly tailored to \nserve a compelling governmental interest, nor did Defendants use the least restrictive means when \nthey refused to grant an accommodation and terminated her instead. \n316.  Because of Defendantsโ actions and policies, Ms. Kloosterman has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, irreparable harm.  She is entitled to an award of equitable relief. \n  48 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.49   Filed 10/11/22   Page 49 of 56\n317.  Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to a declaration that Defendants violated her liberty to \nworship God under Article I, ยง 4 of the Michigan Constitution, to an order against Defendants \ndirecting them to reinstate Ms. Kloosterman, and to an injunction prohibiting future such actions \nby Defendants. \n \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAll Defendants \nViolation of the Michigan Constitution: Freedom of Speech \n318.  Ms.  Kloosterman  incorporates  and  adopts  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the \npreceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n319.  Ms.  Kloosterman  brings  this  cause  of  action  against  Defendant  Metropolitan \nHospital, d/b/a University of Michigan Health-West, and Defendants Pai, Booker Cole, Pierce, \nand Smith, in both their individual and official capacities. \n320.  Article I, ยง 5 of the Michigan Constitution provides: โEvery person may freely \nspeak, write, express and publish his views on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of such \nright; and no law shall be enacted to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.โ  \nM.C.L.A. Const. Art. I, ยง 5. \n321.  The Michigan Court of Appeals and the Sixth Circuit have held that โ[t]he rights \nof free speech under the Michigan and federal constitutions are coterminous.โ  In re Contempt of \nDudzinski, 667 N.W.2d 68, 72 (Mich. Ct. App. 2003) (citing Woodland v. Michigan Citizens \nLobby, 378 N.W.2d 337 (Mich. Ct. App. 1985)); Lucas v. Monroe Cnty., 200 F. 3d 964, 972 n.4 \n(6th Cir. 2000). \n322.  For all the reasons detailed above, supra ยถยถ 224-241, Defendants violated Article \nI, ยง 5 of the Michigan Constitution, by compelling Ms. Kloosterman to speak biology-obscuring \npronouns. \n323.  Compelling Ms. Kloosterman to speak messages that she disagrees with is not \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest, nor did Defendants use the least \nrestrictive means when they refused to grant an accommodation and terminated her, instead. \n  49 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.50   Filed 10/11/22   Page 50 of 56\n324.   Because of Defendantsโ actions and policies, Ms. Kloosterman has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, irreparable harm.  She is entitled to an award of equitable relief.  \n325.  Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to a declaration that Defendants violated her freedom \nof speech under Article I, ยง 5 of the Michigan Constitution, to an order against Defendants \ndirecting them to reinstate Ms. Kloosterman, and to an injunction prohibiting future such actions \nby Defendants. \n \nEIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAll Defendants \nViolation of the Michigan Constitution: Equal Protection \n326.  Ms.  Kloosterman  incorporates  and  adopts  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the \npreceding paragraphs of the Amended Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n327.  Ms.  Kloosterman  brings  this  cause  of  action  against  Defendant  Metropolitan \nHospital, d/b/a University of Michigan-Health West, and Defendants Pai, Booker, Cole, Pierce, \nand Smith, in both their individual and official capacities. \n328.  Article I, ยง 2 of the Michigan Constitution provides: โNo person shall be denied the \nequal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political \nrights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color or national \norigin.โ  M.C.L.A. Const. Art. I, ยง 2. \n329.  The Michigan Supreme Court has held that โMichiganโs equal protection provision \nis coextensive with the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.โ  Shepherd \nMontessori  Ctre.  Milan  v.  Ann  Arbor  Charter  Twp.,  783  N.W.2d  695,  698  (Mich.  2010) \n(โMichigan case law makes it clear that [ยง 2] was intended to afford the same rights as the Federal \nequal protection clause.โ). \n330.  Michiganโs  equal  protection  provision  also  โgoes  beyond  [the  federal  Equal \nProtection Clause] and further proclaims that no person is to be discriminated against.โ  Smith v. \nGibson, 524 F. Supp. 664, 670 (E.D. Mich. 1981).  \n  50 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.51   Filed 10/11/22   Page 51 of 56\n331.  The anti-discrimination provision of Article I, ยง 2 contains no intent requirement.  \nBerry v. Sch. Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 467 F. Supp. 721, 732 (W.D. Mich. 1978) (โIf this \ncourt were to read an intent requirement into the anti-discrimination clauses of Article I, section 2, \nand Article VIII, section 2, it would violate basic principles of constitutional interpretation which \nrequire that this court give effect to the plain meaning of the words used in the constitutional \nprovision, as these words were understood by the people who adopted the Constitution.โ). \n332.  Defendants violated Article I, ยง 2, by discriminating against Ms. Kloosterman \nbecause of her religion.  \n333.  In the alternative, Defendants violated Article I, ยง 2, by enforcing their non-\ndiscrimination policies in such a way that disparately impacted religious employees including Ms. \nKloosterman. \n334.  By treating similarly situated employees disparately on the basis of a suspect \nclassification, religion, the Defendantsโ actions trigger strict scrutiny.  \n335.  Defendantsโ actions in discriminating against Ms. Kloosterman were not narrowly \ntailored to serve a compelling governmental interest, nor did they use the least restrictive means \nwhen they refused to grant an accommodation and terminated her instead. \n336.   Because of Defendantsโ actions and policies, Ms. Kloosterman has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, irreparable harm.  She is entitled to an award of equitable relief.  \n337.  Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to a declaration that Defendants violated her right to \nequal protection under Article I, ยง 2 of the Michigan Constitution, to an order against Defendants \ndirecting them to reinstate Ms. Kloosterman, and to an injunction prohibiting future such actions \nby Defendants. \n \nNINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nDefendant Metropolitan Hospital, d/b/a University of Michigan-Health West \nViolation of the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1974 \n \n338.  Ms.  Kloosterman  incorporates  and  adopts  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the \npreceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n  51 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.52   Filed 10/11/22   Page 52 of 56\n339.  Ms.  Kloosterman  brings  this  cause  of  action  against  Defendant  Metropolitan \nHospital, d/b/a University of Michigan-Health West. \n340.  The Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from โdischarg[ing], or \notherwise discriminat[ing] against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a \nterm, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, \nsex, height, weight, or marital status.โ  Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 37.2202. \n341.  Courts find Title VII precedent โhighly persuasive when interpreting this statute,โ \nfinding  direct  evidence  of  discrimination  or  using  the  McDonnell  Douglas  burden-shifting \nframework where the evidence is circumstantial.  Meyer v. City of Center Line, 619 N.W.2d 182, \n188 (2000); Robinson v. JCIM, LLC, No. 342487, 2018 WL 6185570, at *5 (Mich. Ct. App. Nov. \n27, 2018). \n342.  Section  37.2701(a)  prohibits  employers  from  retaliating  against  employees \nengaged in protected activity such as requesting religious accommodations, and it prohibits \nemployers from โ[c]oerc[ing], indimidat[ing], threaten[ing], or interfer[ing] with a person in the \nexercise or enjoyment of . . . any right granted or protected by this act,โ including religious rights. \nMich. Comp. Laws ยง 37.2701(a), (f); see also Meyer, 619 N.W.2d at 188 (finding retaliation where \nemployee engaged in protected activity known by employer, and employer took adverse action \nthat was causally connected to that protected activity); Robinson, 2018 WL 6185570, at *7.  \n343.  Section 37.2102 defines โ[t]he opportunity to obtain employment . . . without \ndiscrimination because of religionโ as a โcivil right.โ  Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 37.2102. \n344.  Here,  University  of  Michigan  Health-West  violated  Section  37.2202  when  it \nterminated  Ms.  Kloosterman  because  of  her  religious  beliefs.    Her  termination  and  the \nconversations leading up to it constitute direct evidence of discrimination. \n345.  University of Michigan Health-West also violated Section 37.2701(a) when it \nretaliated against Ms. Kloosterman for requesting a religious accommodation after she completed \nthe mandatory training segment on gender identity training. \n  52 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.53   Filed 10/11/22   Page 53 of 56\n346.  Because she disclosed her religious beliefs and requested an accommodation, \nUniversity of Michigan Health-West held hostile meetings and set her termination process in \nmotion. \n347.  By  depriving  Ms.  Kloosterman  of  her  employment  and  future  employment \nopportunities, University of Michigan Health-West violated Section 37.2102, subjecting her to \nreligious discrimination that violated her civil right to access employment and employment \nopportunities.  \n348.  Because  of  University  of  Michigan  Health-Westโs  policies  and  actions,  Ms. \nKloosterman has suffered, and continues to suffer, economic injury and irreparable harm.  She is \nentitled to an award of monetary damages and equitable relief. \n349.  Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws ยง 37.2801, Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to a \ndeclaration that University of Michigan Health-West violated her right rights under Mich. Comp. \nLaws ยงยง 37.2102 and 37.2701, and an injunction prohibiting future such policies and actions by \nUniversity of Michigan Health-West.  Additionally, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws ยงยง 37.2801, \n37.2802, Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to front pay, back pay, restitution, compensatory damages, \nand reinstatement.  Additionally, Ms. Kloosterman is entitled to the reasonable costs of this \nlawsuit, including reasonable attorneysโ fees. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  53 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.54   Filed 10/11/22   Page 54 of 56\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Ms. Kloosterman prays for relief and judgment as follows: \nA.

Order Defendant Metropolitan Hospital, d/b/a University of Michigan Health-\nWest, to place Ms. Kloosterman in the position she would have occupied but for \nDefendantsโ discriminatory and retaliatory treatment of her, and award to Ms. \nKloosterman  all  earnings  that  she  would  have  received  but  for  Defendantsโ \ndiscriminatory  and  retaliatory  treatment,  including,  but  not  limited  to, \nreinstatement, backpay and front pay with interest, seniority, and other lost bene๏ฌts, \nincluding interest pre-judgment and post-judgment, in amounts to be determined at \ntrial; \n  54 \n\nCase 1:22-cv-00944-JMB-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.55   Filed 10/11/22   Page 55 of 56\nF.
