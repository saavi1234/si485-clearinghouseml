    "summary": "<p>This case is about the Trump administration&rsquo;s termination of federal grants to the University of California system and the administration&rsquo;s withholding of federal funding and grants to incentivize universities to eradicate &ldquo;diversity, equity, and inclusion&rdquo; from their campuses. This case is substantially related to <a href=\"../../../../case/46666/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thakur et al v. Trump et al.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2025, labor unions and associations that represent faculty, students, and academic employees throughout the University of California System, brought this action against Trump administration agencies and officials for allegedly waging a campaign to undermine free speech and academic freedom via economic coercion through cutting funding to UC organizations. The plaintiffs are suing under an implied right of action, nonstatutory review, and ultra vires action for alleged violations of First Amendment Freedom of Speech, Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and Fifth Amendment Due Process. Their complaint also brings eight counts against the defendants for violations of the APA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Through counsel, Altshuler Berzon LLP, the plaintiffs argued that the Trump administration unlawfully terminated university funding, and made \"extortionate threats in attempt to coerce the UC into sacrificing the constitutional and state law rights of its faculty, students, academic employees, and staff&rdquo; with the goal of purging &ldquo;left&rdquo; and &ldquo;woke&rdquo; viewpoints from campus. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant&rsquo;s actions disregard TItle VI statutory and regulatory requirements constraining termination of and refusal to grant federal funding, disregard Title IX statutory and regulatory requirements constraining the same actions, and that they unlawfully failed to provide a reasoned decision for terminating $584 million in research grants. The plaintiffs further allege that the defendants lacked a lawful basis for demanding that the UC pay $1 billion as what the plaintiffs describe as &ldquo;ransom,&rdquo; and that the administration is encouraging the UC to violate the constitution by violating its students&rsquo;, faculty, and employees&rsquo; rights, citing demands related to transgender individuals on campus and DEI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the Defendants from continuing to use the unlawful threat of federal funding cuts not authorized by law to illegally coerce the UC into suppressing free speech and academic freedom rights, implementing harmful federal policies on the Trump administration&rsquo;s behalf, and otherwise violating the constitutional and state law rights of UC faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees.</p>\r\n<p>This case was originally assigned to Magistrate Judge Peter H. Kang, but on September 17, 2025, it was found to be substantially related to Thakur et al v. Trump et al and was reassigned to Judge Rita F. Lin accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is in the early stages of litigation as of October 4, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case is about the Trump administration cutting off federal money, or grants, to the University of California (UC) schools. The groups suing say the government is trying to force UC to get rid of programs about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) on their campuses by threatening to take away their funding.\r\n\r\nOn September 16, 2025, unions and associations for UC’s teachers, students, and workers filed a lawsuit. They say the government is trying to stop free speech and academic freedom by using money cuts as a threat. The lawsuit claims the government broke several laws, including the First Amendment (protecting free speech), the Tenth Amendment, and rules about how federal money must be given out.\r\n\r\nThe people suing say the Trump administration suddenly canceled $584 million in research money and demanded UC pay $1 billion, which the plaintiffs called “ransom.” Plaintiffs say the government's real goal is to get rid of “left” or “woke” ideas and make UC break the rights of their teachers, students, and workers, especially around DEI and transgender issues.\r\n\r\nOn October 9, the plaintiffs added more groups to the lawsuit and asked the court to quickly stop the government from cutting or threatening their funding. They also asked the court to order the government not to make UC break any laws or rights to keep their money.\r\n\r\nThe government asked for more time to respond because of the government shutdown, but the judge said no—the case will go on. A hearing is set for November 6, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe case is still active.",

the Council of UC Faculty Associations; and the campus-specific Faculty Associations (“UC \n10  FAs”)  comprised of the Berkeley Faculty Association,  Davis  Faculty Association, Irvine Faculty \n11  Association,  Riverside  Faculty  Association,  San  Diego  Faculty  Association,  Santa  Cruz  Faculty \n12  Association, UC Merced Faculty Association, UC Santa Barbara Faculty Association, UCSF Faculty \n13  Association, and University of California Los Angeles Faculty Association, (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). \n14  Plaintiffs bring this complaint against the President of the United States and multiple federal agencies \n15  and their officers, as outlined below, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin these Defendants \n16  from continuing to use the unlawful threat of federal funding cuts not authorized by law to illegally \n17  coerce the UC into suppressing free speech and academic freedom rights, implementing harmful federal \n18  policies on the Trump administration’s behalf, and otherwise violating the constitutional and state law \n19  rights of UC faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees. Plaintiffs hereby allege as \n20  follows:  \n21  INTRODUCTION \n22  1.  In the midst of World War II, as fascism raged throughout Europe, the United States \n23  Supreme Court proclaimed that “[i]f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that \n24  no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other \n25  matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” West Virginia State \n26  Board of Education v. Burnett, 319 U.S. 624 (1943) (Jackson, R.).  \n27 \n28 \n \n  - 1 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 10 of 123\n \n \n1  2.  Unfortunately, today, the Trump administration is seeking to eclipse this fixed star, \n2  through a scheme of targeting, bullying, and unconstitutional actions aimed at institutions of higher \n3  education across the country. Determined to exert ideological control over the nation’s core institutions, \n4  the Trump administration is engaged in tactics that violate the central norms of our democracy, the \n5  United States Constitution, and duly enacted federal laws. In this campaign, it has now set its sights on \n6  one of the nation’s leading institutions—the University of California system—prompting UC faculty, \n7  academic and other staff, and students to band together to file this federal court action challenging the \n8  Trump administration’s violation of the First Amendment and federal law.   \n9  3.  The University of California is an engine of free thought and intellectual inquiry, research \n10  and invention. It is arguably the premiere public university in the world. The breadth and importance of \n11  its contributions to life sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, literature and the arts, medicine, and \n12  technological  advancement  is  well-illustrated  by  its  production  of  70  Nobel  Prize  winners,  101 \n13  MacArthur “Genius” grant award winners, 66 National Medal of Science winners, and 42 Pulitzer Prize \n14  winners. That output is the product of a culture that encourages free speech, values diversity, and \n15  challenges orthodoxy.  \n16  4.  Beyond the academic and scientific output of the University of California, the system is \n17  an engine of economic productivity, providing healthcare to millions of Californians annually and jobs \n18  to hundreds of thousands, while serving as a vehicle for economic mobility and opportunity for its \n19  innumerable first-generation, working and middle class students from California and across the nation. \n20  5.  Yet rather than acknowledging educational institutions like the UC as the assets to this \n21  nation that they are, the Trump administration views them as barriers to the President’s agenda of \n22  ideological dominance. Even before his reelection, President Trump took direct aim at the country’s top \n23  universities, pledging “to reclaim our once great educational institutions from the radical Left and \n24  Marxist maniacs.” This rhetoric from President Trump and his officials has continued and, indeed, \n25  escalated since the beginning of his second term. Once in office, President Trump gained access to tools \n26  of the United States government that his administration is wielding, unlawfully, to seek to stamp out \n27  movements, opinions, and ideas that challenge his worldview. The President’s attempt to require that \n28  universities conform to his worldview is un-American and unconstitutional.    \n  - 2 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 11 of 123\n \n \n1  6.  Defendants’ actions against the University of California follow a Trump administration \n2  playbook that has already succeeded in undermining free speech and academic freedom in the United \n3  States. The playbook echoes one employed by autocratic movements around the world—be it Hungary, \n4  Turkey, or Brazil. Through a series of actions targeting institutions of higher education, the Trump \n5  administration is attempting to coerce colleges and universities across the country to do what the Trump \n6  administration cannot do directly itself: infringe on the speech rights of faculty, academic and other staff, \n7  and students. \n8  7.  The blunt cudgel the Trump administration has repeatedly employed in this attack on the \n9  independence of institutions of higher education has been the abrupt, unilateral, and unlawful termination \n10  of federal research funding on which those institutions and the public interest rely. These terminations \n11  are accompanied by threats to cancel even more (or all) federal funding, unless the targeted colleges and \n12  universities capitulate to the Trump administration’s demands for control of the curriculum, adoption of \n13  the President’s ideological viewpoints, and restrictions on free speech, among other incursions on \n14  faculty, student and employee rights. \n15  8.  As detailed here, on multiple occasions, Defendants have wielded federal civil rights laws \n16  against the UC and other universities as the purported basis for terminating federal funding and grant \n17  awards, while disregarding the statutory constraints that govern the circumstances under which the civil \n18  rights  laws  authorize  the  termination  or  withholding  of  federal  funds.  These  constraints  include \n19  requirements that the federal government provide notice, hearing, and other procedural protections to \n20  recipients  of  federal  funding  and  others  who  rely  on  it,  to  guard  against  this  kind  of  arbitrary, \n21  ideologically driven, and unlawful use of financial coercion.   \n22  9.  Defendants’ economic coercion has succeeded in some cases, allowing it to secure control \n23  over some formerly independent universities. For example, after the Trump administration unilaterally \n24  cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars of federal grants and threatened to cancel even more, Columbia \n25  University acceded to numerous settlement terms that violate the academic freedom and free speech \n26  rights of Columbia’s faculty, staff, and students. Other efforts at coercion, most prominently those \n27  targeted at Harvard University—which went beyond the cancellation of grants and extended to threats \n28  to take over patent rights and prevent international students from attending Harvard or even entering the \n  - 3 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 12 of 123\n \n \n1  country—have encountered resistance and been declared unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful. Thus, \n2  in President & Fellows of Harvard College v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, \n3  the District of Massachusetts found that the administration “used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a \n4  targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities, and did so in a way that \n5  runs afoul of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI.” __ F.Supp.3d __, 2025 WL 2528380, *36 \n6  (D. Mass. Sep. 3, 2025). \n7  10.  The Trump administration is now taking aim at the University of California, which \n8  comprises ten campuses, three national affiliate laboratories, six academic health centers, and numerous \n9  additional institutes, centers, and research laboratories across the State. The administration has made \n10  clear its intention to  commandeer this public university system  and to  purge from its campuses \n11  viewpoints with which the President and his administration disagree. To accomplish this, Defendants \n12  first unlawfully canceled hundreds of millions in research grants to the University systemwide pursuant \n13  to Executive Orders attacking “‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ (DEIA)” programs—\n14  cancellations that have been declared unlawful and enjoined. See Thakur v. Trump, 2025 WL 1734471 \n15  (N.D. Cal. June 23, 2025). Undeterred, Defendants then cut, froze, or terminated $584 million more from \n16  research projects run by the University of California at Los Angeles (“UCLA”) under the guise of a Title \n17  VI investigation into antisemitism allegations. As in the Harvard case, the Trump administration’s \n18  campaign of economic coercion against the University of California threatens the health and safety of \n19  the people of this country. See President & Fellows of Harvard College, 2025 WL 2528380, at *33 \n20  (“Research that has been frozen could save lives, money, or the environment, to name a few.”). The \n21  federal government has further initiated pretextual investigations of other UC campuses and their faculty, \n22  staff, and students, with a looming threat to additional federal funds unless the UC capitulates to the \n23  Trump administration’s attempt to “promote[] a governmental orthodoxy in violation of the First \n24  Amendment.” Id. at *25.  The UC system receives $17 billion annually (one-third of the University’s \n25  entire operating budget) from the federal government for research, student aid, and health care services. \n26  11.  Defendants’ demands, which are outlined in a letter dated August 8 (“August 8 Demand \n27  Letter”), seek to impose this type of “governmental orthodoxy” upon the University of California as \n28  well, by forcing the UC to cede control over curriculum, faculty hiring and promotion, and university \n  - 4 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 13 of 123\n \n \n1  admissions to the federal government and its government-appointed monitor. They further demand the \n2  adoption  of  restrictions  on  protest  and  other  expressive  activity;  agreement  to  disclose  student \n3  disciplinary records; elimination of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” measures to ensure that students, \n4  workers, and faculty of diverse backgrounds can thrive at the University of California; announcement \n5  that the university does not recognize transgender individuals; and an end to gender-inclusive policies \n6  and gender-affirming medical care to minors—among other policy changes that, if adopted, would \n7  violate the constitutional and state law rights of faculty, students, and staff. If granted this control, the \n8  federal government will be re-shaping UC in its own image for years, possibly decades, to come. \n9  12.  The punishments inflicted on UC as part of this campaign of ideological control exceed \n10  what is permitted under the law. In defiance of applicable law, Defendants have unilaterally and without \n11  warning punished the UC by cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in essential research grant \n12  funding, with threats to withhold more, before any finding has been made by any competent tribunal of \n13  wrongdoing, without any hearing, and without providing the UC and other affected stakeholders with \n14  their right under federal law to contest any finding of wrongdoing. On top of their illegally imposed \n15  financial penalties and unlawful policy demands, Defendants are further demanding that the UC pay \n16  more than $1 billion to the federal government, despite no statutory or other lawful basis for imposing \n17  any such fine. \n18  13.  To prevent Defendants from achieving their unlawful objectives through illegitimate \n19  means, a coalition of labor unions and associations that represent faculty, students, academic employees, \n20  and staff employees at the UC have banded together to file this challenge. The plaintiff coalition seeks \n21  declaratory and injunctive relief forbidding the further use of financial threats to coerce the UC to accede \n22  to demands that will harm faculty, academic employees, staff employees, and students, in violation of \n23  the federal Constitution and duly enacted law.   \n24  PARTIES \n25  A.

UCSF FA also addresses policy and regulatory issues of \n5  concern to the UCSF faculty through state and federal legislative advocacy. \n6  31.  Plaintiff University of California Los Angeles Faculty Association (“UCLA-FA”), \n7  founded in 1979 and reconstituted in May 2024, is a nonprofit membership association of UCLA Senate \n8  faculty with members in a wide variety of departments and schools across UCLA. UCLA-FA represents \n9  UCLA faculty collective interests on employment and academic freedom issues, under the auspices of \n10  the Higher Education and Employment Relations Act, and advocates for a vibrant and well-funded public \n11  higher education system in California.  \n12  32.  Plaintiff University Council–American Federation of Teachers (“UC-AFT”) is a \n13  labor organization and exclusive bargaining representative of 7000 librarians and teaching faculty across \n14  10 UC campuses. UC-AFT’s members teach approximately 30-40% of credit hours at UC, providing \n15  crucial  mentorship  and  support  to  its  most  marginalized  and  historically  underserved  student \n16  populations. UC-AFT’s members are also stewards of the largest library system in the world, protecting \n17  California’s vital records and its cultural heritage. UC-AFT’s members include writers and architects, \n18  scientists and world-class musicians, nurses and lawyers, librarians and archivists, scholars and artists, \n19  K-12 instructors and supervisors of teacher education. Through its contract campaigns, UC-AFT has \n20  fought for and won reappointment protections that create more stable career pathways for teaching \n21  faculty at every stage of their careers. Since 2003, when UC-AFT first secured landmark protections for \n22  Continuing Lecturers, UC-AFT has worked to transform teaching “gigs” into more stable, full-time jobs.   \n23  33.  Plaintiff  University  Professional  and  Technical  Employees–Communication \n24  Workers of America (“UPTE”) is a labor organization and the exclusive bargaining representative of \n25  more than 20,000 health care professionals, research support professionals, and technical employees at \n26  the  UC’s  ten  campuses,  five  medical  centers,  and  numerous  clinics  and  research  laboratories. \n27  Approximately  7,000  of  UPTE’s  members  are  professional  researchers,  including  staff  research \n28 \n  - 11 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 20 of 123\n \n \n1  associates, clinical research coordinators, laboratory technicians and others, many of whose positions \n2  are funded directly or indirectly by federal grants.    \n3  B.

Public Universities Like the University of California Are Crucial Engines of Free \nThought and Academic Inquiry, Scientific Research, and Economic Mobility. \n5 \n87.  In a democracy, institutions of higher education exist not only as places for research, \n6 \nteaching and learning, but as core civic spaces in which ideas—about science, literature, politics, and \n7 \nsociety—are formed, tested, and debated.  \n8 \n88.  By contrast, autocratic governments consider independent inquiry and thought to be a \n9 \nthreat. In the 1930s, as Nazism was rising in Germany, books from university libraries that were deemed \n10 \nto be in conflict with the National Socialist party and/or books by Jewish authors or with Jewish themes \n11 \nwere removed and burned in town squares. Curriculum was modified. Today, authoritarian governments \n12 \nin Hungary,1 Turkey,2 and Brazil3 have each attempted to place universities under the control of the \n13 \ncentral government. \n14 \n89.  The University of California is a leading academic institution in the United States. Indeed, \n15 \nit is among the world’s premier institutions of higher learning. The UC System has ten campuses (UC \n16 \nBerkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Merced, UC Riverside, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco, \n17 \nUC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz), three affiliate national laboratories (Lawrence Berkeley \n18 \nNational Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory), \n19 \nsix academic health centers systems (UC Davis Health, UC San Diego Health, UCI Health, UCLA \n20 \nHealth, UCR Health, and UCSF Health), and numerous institutes, centers, and research laboratories \n21 \nacross the state. \n22 \n90.  As alleged in Thakur v. Trump, Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL (N.D. Cal.), research by \n23 \nparticipants in the UC System has contributed to the public interest in immeasurable ways.

The UC System has produced 70 Nobel Prize winners, 101 MacArthur “Genius” grant \n9  award winners, 66 National Medal of Science winners, and 42 Pulitzer Prize winners.13  Since 2013, the \n10  UC System has topped the National Academy of Inventors’ list of universities worldwide with the most \n11  utility patents.14 \n12 \n \n13  4 Pranay Bhattacharyya, UCLA: Birthplace of the Internet, US Tech News (Apr. 28, 2021), \nhttps://uctechnews.ucop.edu/ucla-birthplace-of-the-internet. \n14  5 USPath Center, 4 Unexpected Discoveries from UC, UCPath Jobs, https://ucpathjobs.org/lifestyle/4-\nunexpected-discoveries-uc/ (last visited May 27, 2025). \n15  6 Lauren Biron, First Results from DESI Make the Most Precise Measurement of Our Expanding \nUniverse, Berkeley Lab News Center (Apr. 4, 2024),  \n16 \nhttps://newscenter.lbl.gov/2024/04/04/desi-first-results-make-most-precise-measurement-of- \nexpanding-universe/. \n17 \n7 Kara Manke, Jerome R.

Through continual development of new technologies, UC research has been essential to \n2  the state’s and the nation’s economy, leading to job growth, the founding and expansion of companies \n3  and industries, and significant scientific advancements. Industries that have grown out of UC research \n4  include biotechnology, computing, semiconductors, telecommunications, and agriculture.15 \n5  94.  UC research is making ongoing and rapid contributions to the nation’s economic progress \n6  and knowledge. The UC System averages four new inventions per day. In 2023, 78 startups were \n7  launched using UC intellectual property or technology.16 Almost one-tenth of all U.S. academic research \n8  is conducted by UC researchers.17 \n9  95.  All of this output comes from the vitality of UC’s academic and social culture, which \n10  encourages and promotes intellectual debate, challenges to orthodoxy, interdisciplinary collaboration, \n11  and diversity in all of its forms. This culture has produced tremendous public goods for decades and has \n12  been expressed in activism and advocacy for causes that were unpopular—and counter to government \n13  positions—in their time: for example, the fight for civil rights, opposition to the Vietnam War, and \n14  challenges to South African apartheid. \n \n15 \nII.  For Decades, the Federal Government Has Funded UC Because UC Produces \nResults: Public Goods of Immeasurable Value. \n16 \n96.  The UC System’s research, like that of other major academic institutions in the United \n17 \nStates, relies heavily on its partnership with the federal government, including on the funding that the \n18 \nfederal government provides for research that is essential to the nation. For decades, this partnership has \n19 \nproduced  groundbreaking  innovations  that  improve  the  health,  safety,  knowledge  base,  and \n20 \ncompetitiveness of the American public. \n21 \n97.  Federal funding is an indispensable source of UC research funding, comprising the \n22 \nmajority of the UC System’s total research awards.18 In fiscal year 2024, the UC System received $4.069 \n23 \nbillion in federal research awards covering 10,256 distinct awards.19 \n24 \n25 \n \n26  15 Id. \n16 Id. \n27 \n17 Id. \n18 Id. \n28 \n19 Id. \n  - 18 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 27 of 123\n \n \n1  98.  The UC System receives more National  Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and National \n2  Science Foundation (“NSF”) funding than any other institution.20  \n3  99.  In fiscal year 2024, the UC System received approximately the following amounts in \n4  research funding, by agency:21 \n5  a.  $2.54 billion from NIH \n6  b.  $525 million from NSF \n7  c.  $326 million from Defense \n8  d.  $160 million from Energy \n9  e.  $122 million from other agencies of HHS \n10  f.  $104 million from NASA \ng.  $86 million from USDA \n11 \nh.  $68 million from Commerce \n12 \ni.  $39 million from Interior \n13 \nj.  $27 million from Education \n14 \nk.  $20 million from State \n15 \nl.  $47 million from other agencies \n16 \n100.  These federal funding sources, and the research talent they attract and support, have \n17 \nenabled the UC System to make essential contributions to human progress for decades. Because the \n18 \nnature of research requires years of ongoing work, the UC system has operated research programs across \n19 \npresidential administrations for generations. \n20 \n101.  The innovations the UC System has enabled would be impossible if federal grant funding \n21 \nwere terminated. \n22 \n102.  The faculty members and other research personnel who conduct this research depend on \n23 \nfederal grants. And in turn, their careers—their hiring, tenure, promotion, and retention—depend on \n24 \nfederally supported research. \n25 \n103.  The UC’s dependence on its partnership with the federal government, and its contribution \n26 \nto the nation’s welfare, extends beyond its research function. The UC System is also an important \n27 \n \n20 Id. \n28 \n21 Id. \n  - 19 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 28 of 123\n \n \n1  provider of health care to the population of California. The UC System’s medical centers provide care \n2  to millions of Californians annually, including 10.8 million outpatient visits, 1.32 million inpatient days, \n3  and 474,000 emergency room visits, at a net community benefit of $2 billion.22   \n4  104.  As such, systemwide, UC Health receives almost $5.3 billion annually from the federal \n5  Medicare program and nearly $4.6 billion annually from the federal portion of the federal-state Medicaid \n6  program, or $9.9 billion in total.23 \n7  105.  The UC System is also a leading engine of economic mobility for its students. One in \n8  every three students who enter college in the bottom 20 percent of income move to the top 20 percent in \n9  income as adults.24 After graduating, UC graduates who entered college from families who are in the \n10  bottom 20 percent of income earn as much as students from middle-income families; and similarly, \n11  graduates who were first-generation college students earn as much as students whose parent graduated \n12  from college by five years after graduation.25 A majority of the UC’s first-generation college students \n13  and federal financial aid grant recipients earn more than their families within four years of graduation.26  \n14  Ninety-three percent of the UC’s lowest-income students go on to earn more than their parents.27 \n15  106.  The UC System’s contribution to economic mobility depends on federal funding. The UC \n16  receives $1.9 billion in student financial aid funding annually, including $494 million in Pell Grants, \n17  over $1 billion in federal student loans, $86 million in graduate fellowships and scholarships, $21 million \n18  in federal work-study, and more than $25 million in other undergraduate grants and scholarships.28 \n19  107.  In total, including research, health care, and student financial aid funding, the UC receives \n20  over $17 billion per year from the federal government. \n21 \n22   \n22 Univ. of Cal., UC and the Federal Government (May 2025), \n23  https://ucop.edu/communications/_files/uc-and-the-federal-government.pdf.  \n23 Id. \n24  24 New data shows University of California degrees lead to jobs, economic prosperity, Univ. of Cal. \nOff. of the President (July 14, 2025), https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/new-data-\n25  show-university-california-degrees-lead-jobs-economic-prosperity.  \n25 Univ. of Cal., UC helps level the playing field and promotes economic mobility, particularly for low-\n26 \nincome students, https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/CLIMB-a-\nmobility-analysis.pdf. \n27 \n26 New Data, supra note 24. \n27 UC and the Federal Government, supra note 22. \n28 \n28 Id. \n  - 20 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 29 of 123\n \n \n1  108.  The UC is also the second largest employer in the state. Nearly 275,000 people work at \n2  the UC campuses and medical centers, and the UC indirectly supports over 500,000 jobs.29  \n3  109.

President  Trump’s  2024  campaign  website  included  this  promise  and  numerous \n11 \nstatements describing his intention to curtail academic freedom and control the viewpoints expressed on \n12 \ncampuses. His campaign website pledged, “we will take the billions and billions of dollars that we will \n13 \ncollect by taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments, and we will then \n14 \nuse that money to endow a new institution called the American Academy.”31 \n15 \n112.  The Trump administration is particularly focused on suppressing views that challenge its \n16 \npreferred narrative with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and with respect to race and gender—\n17 \nwhat it refers to as “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or “DEI,” or sometimes “wokeness.” \n18 \n113.  President  Trump’s  campaign  website  highlighted  that  such  viewpoints  would  be \n19 \nprohibited at the American Academy, stating that “there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed—none \n20 \nof that’s going to be allowed.”32 \n21 \n22 \n23   \n29 Letter from James B.

Vice  President  JD  Vance  has  for  years  similarly  expressed  his  intention  to  target \n2  universities on the basis of disfavored viewpoints. In a speech titled “The Universities are the Enemy” \n3  given at the National Conservatism Conference on November 2, 2021, he warned that “[t]he professors \n4  are the enemy”33 and that “the universities are the enemy,” and urged an “aggressive[] attack [on] the \n5  universities in this country.”34 On September 17, 2021, Vance stated, “we should seize the institutions \n6  of the left and turn them against the left … we need a de-wokeification program in the United States … \n7  you go down American institutions, and make it possible for conservatives to actually govern and \n8  succeed.”35 As an example, Vance stated, “you’re not allowed to teach critical race theory anymore, \n9  you’re not allowed to teach critical gender theory anymore … you’re not allowed to do those things and \n10  get a dollar of federal funding.”36  \n11  115.  In October  2021, Vance  described the strategy of using  federal  funding to  coerce \n12  viewpoint compliance at universities: “We got a tool here …. We have got to cut off the flow of funding \n13  to the universities that are indoctrinating our children …. If we’re going to spend money on these \n14  universities, they should have to teach things that are consistent with our values and our worldview … \n15  we go to the universities, we use the hundreds of billions of dollars that we send to them as leverage and \n16  we say: ‘Unless you stop indoctrinating our children, unless you stop indoctrinating our entire society, \n17  you don’t get another dime of our money.’”37 \n18  116.  On December 14, 2023, Vance posted to X, “[t]he endowments at Penn, Harvard & MIT \n19  have a combined $95B+ in assets,” and the schools “use these funds to push DEI and woke insanity[.]”38 \n20 \n21 \n \n22 \n33 Henry Reichman, “The Professors Are the Enemy,” The Chron. of Higher Educ.

It’s time to outlaw it \n2  nationwide, starting with the federal government.”39 \n3  117.  Since becoming Vice President, Vance has praised Hungarian President Victor Orbán’s \n4  aggressive strategy to make Hungarian universities better reflect Orbán’s own ideology.40 \n5  118.  Defendant Leo Terrell, appointed by Trump to head the newly created DOJ “Task Force \n6  to Combat Anti-Semitism” (“DOJ Task Force”), has more recently echoed these same sentiments and \n7  confirmed the Trump administration’s strategy to use the threat of federal funding losses to coerce \n8  universities into adopting the Trump administration’s preferred viewpoints.  \n9  119.  On February 26, 2025, a news article reported Defendant Terrell as saying, “When you \n10  see universities start losing millions of dollars in federal funding, you’re going to see a change in their \n11  behavior.”41 \n12  120.  A few days later, Defendant Terrell stated in a Fox Business clip he later shared on X, \n13  “I’ve targeted ten schools. Columbia, Harvard, Michigan, UCLA, USC. Let me tell you what we’re \n14  going to do. We’re going to take away your funding.”42 \n15  121.  Defendant Terrell starkly described Defendants’ funding coercion strategy on Fox News \n16  on or about March 9, 2025: “We’re taking away their money. We’re gonna bankrupt these universities. \n17  We’re gonna take away every single federal dollar. … The academic system in this country has been \n18  hijacked by the left, has been hijacked by the Marxists. They have controlled the mindset of our young \n19  people … and we have to put an end to it. … If these universities do not play ball, lawyer up, because \n20  the federal government is coming after you.”43 \n21 \n \n22  39 JD Vance (@JDVance), X.com (Jun. 12, 2024, 9:55 AM ET), \nhttps://x.com/JDVance/status/1800889737718505697, https://perma.cc/C2PE-JH2Q. \n23  40 Rob Dreher, “I would like to see European elites actually listen to their people for a change”: An \nInterview with J.D.

Other Trump administration officials have expressed similar sentiments. On February 17, \n2  2025, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Edward Martin sent a letter to \n3  Georgetown University Law School asserting that it was “unacceptable” for the private Jesuit university \n4  to “teach and promote” diversity, equity, and inclusion, and seeking to pressure the institution to remove \n5  such content from its “curriculum,” “courses,” and “teaching.”44 On May 23, 2025, Defendant McMahon \n6  posted to X, “Every student deserves an education free from … ideological agendas that undermine equal \n7  opportunity.”45 \n8  123.  Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued a series of Executive Orders that laid \n9  the groundwork for his administration’s coordinated attack on academic freedom and free speech and \n10  campaign to control universities. \n11  124.  On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, titled “Ending \n12  Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.”46 Executive Order 14151 proclaims \n13  that  “‘diversity,  equity,  inclusion,  and  accessibility’  (DEIA)”  programs  are  “illegal  and  immoral \n14  discrimination programs.” The Order directs “[e]ach agency, department, or commission head” to \n15  “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all … ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts.”47 \n16  125.  On January 21, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 14173, titled “Ending \n17  Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.”48 Executive Order 14173 states that \n18  “‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI),” and “‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ (DEIA)” \n19  policies are “illegal,” “dangerous,” and “immoral” and can violate federal civil rights laws. The Order \n20  directs federal agencies to take action “[h]olding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for \n21  taking ‘affirmative action’” against DEI and DEIA policies and directs the heads of all agencies to “take \n22  all appropriate action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector the \n23 \n \n24  44 Letter from Edward R.

Neither Executive Order 14151 nor Executive Order 14173 define the terms “DEI,” \n8  “DEIA,” “diversity,” “equity,” “inclusion,” or “accessibility.” \n9  128.  On  January  27,  2025,  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (“OMB”)  issued  a \n10  memorandum  requiring  all  agencies  to  “temporarily  pause  all  activities  related  to  obligations  or \n11  disbursement of Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated \n12  by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernment \n13  organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.”51 \n14  129.  On January 29, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14188, titled “Additional \n15  Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism.”52 Executive Order 14188 requires the heads of all executive \n16  agencies or departments to submit reports identifying all civil and criminal authorities or actions within \n17  their jurisdictions “that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and \n18  analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving \n19  institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, \n20  2023, campus anti-Semitism.”53  \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24   \n49 Id. \n25  50 Id. \n51 Acting Director Matthew J.

Executive Order 14188 explicitly reaffirmed Executive Order 13899, which President \n2  Trump issued during his first term on December 11, 2019. Executive Order 13899 specifically invokes \n3  Title VI enforcement as the means for agencies to combat antisemitism on university campuses.54 \n4  131.  Executive Order 14188 makes no mention of the First Amendment or the need to balance \n5  protection of free speech with the imperative to eradicate illegal discrimination and harassment. \n6  132.  On February 3, 2025, Defendant DOJ announced the creation of the multi-agency DOJ \n7  Task Force, led by Defendant Terrell, to carry out the mandate of the executive order.55 The DOJ Task \n8  Force includes representatives from Defendant DOJ, Defendant ED, and Defendant HHS. \n9  133.  Later that day, Defendant ED announced new Title VI investigations into UC Berkeley, \n10  Columbia, Northwestern University, Portland State University, and the University of Minnesota, Twin \n11  Cities, where ED stated that “widespread antisemitic harassment has been reported.”56 \n12  134.  On or about February 14, 2025, the Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague \n13  Letter requiring all educational institutions to “cease all efforts to circumvent prohibitions on the use of \n14  race by relying on proxies or other indirect means to accomplish such ends” and to “cease all reliance \n15  on third-party contractors, clearinghouses, or aggregators that are being used by institutions in an effort \n16  to circumvent prohibited uses of race.”57 The February 14 Dear Colleague Letter instructed universities \n17  to end all DEI programs within 14 days or risk losing federal funding. \n \n18 \nB.  The Trump Administration Has Been Implementing Its Funding Coercion \nPlaybook at Dozens of Universities and Warning Others They Are Next. \n19 \n135.  Since taking office, the Trump administration has targeted universities where faculty, \n20 \nstudents,  and  academic  and  staff  employees  have  expressed  viewpoints  with  which  the  Trump \n21 \nadministration disagrees, and consistently executed the playbook described by Vance, Terrell, and others \n22 \n23 \n \n54 Exec.

On March 3, 2025, Defendants HHS, ED, and GSA announced a “comprehensive review \n9  of Columbia’s federal contracts and grants in light of ongoing investigations for potential violations of \n10  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.”58 The announcement referred to “Columbia’s ongoing inaction in the \n11  face of relentless harassment of Jewish students” and declared that, as a result, “Stop Work Orders for \n12  $51.4 million in contracts between Columbia University and the Federal Government” were being \n13  considered. It further stated that the task force would “conduct a comprehensive review of the more than \n14  $5 billion in federal grant commitments to Columbia University to ensure the university is in compliance \n15  with federal regulations, including its civil rights responsibilities.”59 \n16  137.  The following day, on March 4, 2025, President Trump posted on Truth Social, “All \n17  Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests. Agitators \n18  will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students \n19  will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your \n20  attention to this matter.”60  \n21  138.  Just three days later, on March 7, 2025, Defendants DOJ, HHS, ED, and GSA announced \n22  the “immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia \n23  University due to the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish \n24 \n \n25 \n58 HHS, ED, and GSA announce additional measures to end anti-Semitic harassment on college \ncampuses, U.S. Gen.

Immediately thereafter, on March 10, 2025, the Department of Education’s Office of \n4  Civil Rights sent letters to 60 other universities supposedly also “under investigation for antisemitic \n5  discrimination and harassment,” including UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, and UC \n6  Berkeley, “warning them of potential enforcement actions if they do not fulfill their obligations under \n7  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to protect Jewish students on campus ….”63  \n8  140.  In their press release publicizing these warning letters to 60 universities, Defendants \n9  underscored that they had “announced the immediate cancellation of $400 million in federal grants and \n10  contracts to Columbia University due to the school’s continued inaction to protect Jewish students from \n11  discrimination.”64 The clear import of the press release was to threaten UC and the other universities that \n12  received the letter that they, too, might be subject to “immediate cancelation” of federal grants and \n13  contracts if they did not, in the words of Defendant Terrell, “play ball.”65 \n14  141.  On March 13, 2025, HHS, ED, and GSA sent another letter to Columbia “outlin[ing] \n15  immediate next steps that we regard as a precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia \n16  University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.”66 The letter listed nine \n17  demands, including inter alia that Columbia impose specific forms of discipline (including “expulsion \n18  or multi-year suspension”) on students involved in particular protests, restructure its entire student \n19  disciplinary system in a centralized manner dictated by the federal government, institute a “mask ban,” \n \n20 \n61 DOJ, HHS, ED, and GSA announce initial cancellation of grants and contracts to Columbia \nUniversity worth $400 million, U.S. Gen.

In a March 19, 2025 interview, Defendant Terrell was asked if it was his “intention” to \n4  “get a consent decree where Columbia gets a new law school dean, they get a new president, a new \n5  board, a new department of history, a new set of reasonable time, place, and manner regulations for a \n6  [sic] speech on campus that ban masks.” Terrell answered, “Yes, yes, and yes.”68 \n7  143.  On March 21, 2025, Columbia shared updated policies appearing to give in to nearly all \n8  of Defendants’ demands.69 Among other things, Columbia agreed to expand “intellectual diversity \n9  among  faculty”;  abolish  its  independent  body  responsible  for  discipline  decisions  and  centralize \n10  disciplinary proceedings; hire “special officers” with the “ability to remove individuals from campus \n11  and/or arrest”; and appoint a new Senior Vice Provost to review the Middle East, South Asian, and \n12  African Studies department and “ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced,” \n13  review a new process for hiring faculty in these programs, review the process for “approving curricular \n14  changes,” and make recommendations about “necessary changes” and “academic restructuring” to \n15  “ensure academic excellence and complementarity” in Columbia’s Middle East programs.70 \n16  144.  Nevertheless, the $400 million in terminated funding was not reinstated or restored to \n17  Columbia at that time. Instead, the Trump administration escalated the funding freezes. Defendant NIH \n18  alone  terminated  or  froze  approximately  $1.2  billion  in  funding  to  Columbia,  and  other  federal \n19  agencies—such as Defendant NSF—terminated or froze additional funding.71 \n20  145.

In response to the Trump administration’s coercive demands, and as a condition of \n6  regaining access to federal funds, Columbia entered into a settlement agreement that infringes on faculty \n7  and student First Amendment rights and imposes a series of obligations having nothing to do with Title \n8  VI compliance. Among other things, the agreement requires Columbia to: pay a $200 million fine to the \n9  United States; establish a Resolution Monitor to monitor Columbia’s compliance with the settlement; \n10  maintain the Senior Vice Provost to “conduct a thorough review of the portfolio of programs in regional \n11  areas  across the University, starting immediately with  the Middle East,”  “ensure the educational \n12  offerings are comprehensive and balanced,” “[r]eview all and curriculum,” create “new programs to \n13  address the full range of fields,” create a new process for hiring non-tenured faculty across the university, \n14  review the process for “approving curricular changes,” and make recommendations to the President and \n15  Provost about “necessary changes, academic restructuring, or investments that will ensure academic \n16  excellence and complementarity in the given academic areas”; appoint new faculty members with joint \n17  positions in both the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and the departments of economics, political \n18  science, or the School of International and Public Affairs, who must contribute to an “intellectually \n19  diverse academic environment”; and eliminate “programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-\n20  based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or similar efforts,” or that “provide benefits or advantages to \n21  individuals on the basis of protected characteristics in any school, component, division, department, \n22  foundation, association or element within the entire Columbia University system,” and provide a report \n23  to the Resolution Monitor, including “an assurance that Columbia has acted responsibly to ensure its \n24  programs do not promote unlawful DEI goals,” which term is not defined.73  \n25 \n26   \n72 Columbia University Resolution Agreement (Jul. 23, 2025), \n27 \nhttps://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/July%202025%20Announcement/Columbia%\n20University%20Resolution%20Agreement.pdf. \n28 \n73 Id. \n  - 30 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 39 of 123\n \n \n1  147.  The agreement further requires Columbia to provide the Resolution Monitor and the \n2  federal  government  with  detailed  admissions  data;  requires  Columbia  to  “maintain  merit-based \n3  admissions policies”; prohibits Columbia from using any “proxy for racial admission … Columbia may \n4  not use personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means \n5  to introduce or justify discrimination;” prohibits the use of “race, color, sex, or national origin as a \n6  factor—implicit or explicit—in hiring decisions across all schools, departments, and programs;” requires \n7  Columbia to “undertake a comprehensive review of its international admissions processes and policies,” \n8  ensure international students are “asked questions designed to elicit their reasons for wishing to study in \n9  the  United  States,”  and  ensure  “all  students,  international  and  domestic,  are  committed  to  the \n10  longstanding traditions of American universities”; and “comply with all requests for immigration \n11  information” relating to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, including “all disciplinary actions \n12  involving student visa-holders resulting in expulsions or suspensions, and arrest records that Columbia \n13  is aware of for criminal activities ... to the extent permitted by FERPA.”74 \n14  148.  The agreement further requires Columbia to impose new protest restrictions and reform \n15  its disciplinary processes so that students will no longer serve on University Judicial Board (UJB) \n16  panels.75 \n17  149.  After the Columbia settlement was announced, on July 25, 2025, Defendant McMahon \n18  posted on X, “The deal with Columbia should serve as a roadmap for institutions across the country,” \n19  and stated on Fox News, “I’m hoping that this negotiation will become a template for other universities \n20  across the country that have these same kinds of practices.”76  \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26   \n74 Id. at 8-10. \n27  75 Id. at 10. \n76 Secretary Linda McMahon (@EDSecMcMahon), X.com (Jul. 25, 2025, 10:53 AM ET), \n28 \nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1948758537468792992, https://perma.cc/ZS3M-MEH8. \n  - 31 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 40 of 123\n \n \n1  (2) Brown \n2  150.  The  Trump  administration  has  taken  similar  action  aimed  at  controlling  Brown \n3  University. \n4  151.  Brown was one of the 60 universities to receive the March 10, 2025 letter warning of \n5  potential Title VI enforcement actions arising from discrimination against Jewish students.77 \n6  152.  On April 3, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration intended to block \n7  $510 million in federal contracts and grants to Brown.78 \n8  153.  On or about April 10, 2025, HHS expanded a Title VI investigation—originally opened \n9  in February 2025 and concerning only the medical school’s May 2024 commencement ceremony—to \n10  include incidents occurring at the entire university from October 7, 2023 to the present.79 \n11  154.  Beginning in April, Brown ceased receiving reimbursements for expenses incurred for \n12  active grants from NIH.80 Those unreimbursed funds totaled over $50 million at the time Brown entered \n13  the agreement described below; that number was increasing by approximately $3.5 million per week at \n14  the time of the agreement.81 The Trump administration additionally terminated eight federal contracts \n15  and more than 30 federal grants to Brown.82 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n \n77 U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Sends Letters to 60 Universities Under \n19 \nInvestigation for Antisemitic Discrimination and Harassment, U.S. Dep’t of Educ.

It was not until Brown capitulated and agreed to a host of demands by the Trump \n2  administration that the administration finally restored the frozen federal funding and terminated grants.83 \n3  156.  As a condition of regaining access to the frozen funds and having its future applications \n4  for federal funding “[f]airly consider[ed] … without disfavored treatment,”84 Brown agreed to pay a $50 \n5  million fine to state workforce development organizations.85 The settlement also requires Brown to adopt \n6  the administration’s definitions of “male,” “female,” and “sex,” as set forth in Executive Orders 14168 \n7  and  14201;  requires  Brown  to  offer  women  the  option  of  “female-only  housing,  restrooms,  and \n8  showering facilities” and ensure students have access to “single-sex floors in on-campus housing”; and \n9  prohibits Brown from performing gender reassignment surgery or prescribing puberty blockers or \n10  hormones “to any minor child for the purpose of aligning the child’s appearance with an identity that \n11  differs from his or her sex.”86 \n12  157.  The settlement agreement directly regulates academic freedom and the content of speech \n13  at the university. Brown must “support ... research and education about Israel, and a robust Program in \n14  Judaic Studies ... renewed partnerships with Israeli academics and national Jewish organizations, and a \n15  convening of alumni, students, and faculty to celebrate 130 years of Jewish life at Brown in the 2025-\n16  2026 academic year.”87 \n17  158.  Other provisions mirror those in the Columbia agreement, including those outlawing \n18  “DEI” initiatives and the use of personal statements as a “proxy” for race in admissions.88 \n19  159.

The Trump administration has also targeted the University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”). \n5  162.  On February 6, 2025, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (“ED OCR”) \n6  notified Penn that ED OCR had initiated a Title IX investigation into the university on the basis of Penn \n7  permitting a transgender woman to compete on the Penn women’s swimming and diving team.91 On or \n8  about March 19, 2025, the Trump administration announced it was freezing $175 million in federal \n9  funding to Penn. The administration did not notify the university, which learned of the freeze from media \n10  reports.92 Penn faculty across seven schools received stop work orders on federally contracted research, \n11  and several federal grants were canceled.93 \n12  163.  To restore the $175 million in federal funding that the Trump administration unlawfully \n13  terminated, Penn capitulated to the administration’s demands and “entered into a Resolution Agreement \n14  to comply with Title IX,” announced by the Department of Education on July 1.94 \n15  164.  The Resolution Agreement requires Penn to “restore to female athletes all individual \n16  UPenn Division I swimming records, titles, or similar recognitions which were misappropriated by male \n17  athletes allowed to compete in female categories”; “issue a public statement to the University community \n18  … specifying that UPenn will not allow males to compete in female athletic programs or occupy Penn \n19  Athletics female intimate facilities”; in that public statement, “adopt biology-based definitions for the \n20   \n90 Donald J.

The  Trump  administration  has  taken  similar  action  aimed  at  controlling  Harvard \n10  University—but the District Court of Massachusetts has enjoined and declared those efforts unlawful in \n11  violation of the First Amendment, Title VI, and the APA, based on the court’s finding that, among other \n12  things, “Defendants unconstitutionally sought to force Harvard to better manifest the government’s \n13  favored worldview” by “urg[ing] and threaten[ing] Harvard ... to hire faculty and make curricula and \n14  research choices that better aligned with the government’s preferred viewpoints, to the detriment of \n15  professors and researchers with competing views.”97 \n16  167.  On March 31, 2025, the Trump administration announced “a comprehensive review of \n17  federal contracts and grants at Harvard University and its affiliates” as “part of the ongoing efforts of the \n18  Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.”98 The announcement stated that the Task Force would \n19  “review the more than $255.6 million in grants between Harvard University, its affiliates and the Federal \n20  Government” as well as “more than $8.7 billion in multi-year grant commitments to Harvard University \n21  and its affiliates to ensure the university is in compliance with federal regulations, including its civil \n22  rights responsibilities.”99 \n \n23 \n95 An update to the Penn community on federal funding, University of Pennsylvania Office of the \nPresident (Mar. 25, 2025), https://president.upenn.edu/announcements/update-penn-community-\n24 \nfederal-funding.  \n25  96 Secretary Linda McMahon (@EDSecMcMahon), X.com (July 31, 2025, 12:33 PM ET), \nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1950957895954149493, https://perma.cc/FJX4-HXG2. \n26 \n97 Presidents and Fellows of Harvard Coll., 2025 WL 2528380, at *27. \n98 HHS, ED, and GSA Initiate Federal Contract and Grant Review of Harvard  \n27 \nUniversity, Dep’t of Health and Hum.

The announcement did not point to any specific allegations of antisemitic discrimination, \n2  nor did it request or advise Harvard of any steps to deter or remedy such discrimination. \n3  169.  The announcement further criticized Harvard for “promoting divisive ideologies over free \n4  inquiry,”100 although it did not specify what it meant by “divisive ideologies” or provide any specific \n5  allegations of promoting such ideologies. \n6  170.  On April 3, 2025, the Task Force sent a letter to Harvard outlining “immediate next steps \n7  that we regard as necessary for Harvard University’s continued financial relationship with the United \n8  States government” and listing nine demands “that the government views as necessary for Harvard to \n9  implement to remain a responsible recipient of federal taxpayer dollars.”101 \n10  171.  The list contained a sweeping range of vaguely defined provisions, only a few of which \n11  had any apparent connection to combating antisemitism, including demands to: \n12  •  review  and  make  “necessary  changes”  to  unspecified  “[p]rograms  and \n13  departments that fuel antisemitic harassment”; \n14  •  make unspecified programmatic changes “to address bias, improve viewpoint \n15  diversity, and end ideological capture”; \n16  •  overhaul  student  discipline,  among  other  things  to  ensure  that  “senior \n17  administrative leaders are responsible for final decisions”; \n18  •  enact a “mask ban”; \n19  •  hold student groups accountable for unspecified “violations of Harvard policy”  \n20  •  undertake sweeping “[g]overnance and leadership reforms” described only as \n21  “meaningful”  and  designed  to  “empower  faculty  and  administrative  leaders  who  are \n22  committed to implementing the changes indicated in this letter”; \n23  •  adopt  “merit-based  admissions  policies”  and  “[m]erit-based  hiring  reform” \n24  without any description of what those polices entail other than an additional demand to “cease \n25  all preferences based on race, color, or national origin”; \n26 \n \n27 \n100 Id. \n101 Letter from Josh Gruenbaum to Alan M.

On April 11, 2025, the Trump administration sent another letter to Harvard (“the April \n11  11 Letter”). The April 11 Letter listed conditions for “maintain[ing] Harvard’s financial relationship with \n12  the federal government,” including: \n13  •  “‘commission[ing] an external party … to audit the student body, faculty, staff, \n14  and leadership for viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must \n15  be individually viewpoint diverse’; \n16  •  ‘abolish[ing]  all  criteria,  preferences,  and  practices,  whether  mandatory  or \n17  optional, throughout [Harvard’s] admissions and hiring practices, that function as ideological \n18  litmus tests’; for departments, fields, and teaching units found to ‘lack viewpoint diversity’; \n19  •  ‘hiring a critical mass of new faculty’ and ‘admitting a critical mass of students’ \n20  to provide the government's preferred balance of viewpoint diversity;  ‘reform[ing] and \n21  restructuring’ governance; \n22  •  ‘reducing the power held by students and untenured faculty,’ as well as “the power \n23  held by faculty ... more committed to activism than scholarship’; and ‘shutter[ing]’ all DEI \n24  programs ‘through structural and personnel changes.’”102 \n25  173.

Within hours, the Federal Task Force froze over $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard.104 \n2  175.  Over the course of the following week, President Trump issued a series of social media \n3  posts expressly stating his goal of using federal funding to purge leftist viewpoints from the university. \n4  176.  On April 14, President asked, “What if we never pay them? Wouldn’t that be cool?”105 A \n5  senior government official described the Trump administration’s strategy as “mak[ing] examples of elite \n6  schools to intimidate other universities.”106   \n7  177.  The next day, President Trump posted on Truth Social, “Perhaps Harvard should lose its \n8  Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and \n9  terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’”107 “Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, \n10  idiots and ‘birdbrains’ …. Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive \n11  Federal Funds.”108  \n12  178.  On April 16, 2025, President Trump posted on Truth Social: “Everyone knows that \n13  Harvard has ‘lost its way.’ They hired, from New York (Bill D) and Chicago (Lori L), at ridiculously \n14  high salaries/fees, two of the WORST and MOST INCOMPETENT mayors in the history of our \n15  Country, to ‘teach’ municipal management and government.

When it got so bad that they just \n20  couldn’t take it anymore, they moved this grossly inept woman into another position, teaching, rather \n21  than firing her ON THE SPOT. Since then much else has been found out about her, but she remains in \n22  place.

In early and mid-May, Harvard received letters from various government agencies \n11  terminating grants related to medical, scientific, technological, and other projects.112 \n12  182.  The  termination  letters  did  not  “present[]  any  program-specific  rationale  for  the \n13  terminations.”113 “None of the Termination Letters identified any specific instance of antisemitism on \n14  Harvard’s campus, specified how Harvard failed to respond to any such acts of antisemitism in a way \n15  that violated Title VI, or reflected any effort to follow the Title VI procedural requirements that govern \n16  the termination of federal funding.”114 \n17  183.  On April 11, 2025, the AAUP and AAUP-Harvard Faculty Chapter filed a complaint \n18  against the Trump administration (later joined by UAW, Harvard Graduate Students Union, and Harvard \n19  Academic Workers) seeking to enjoin the Trump administration’s unlawful and coercive conduct and \n20  grant terminations.115 The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the First Amendment by \n21  retaliating based on the exercise of First Amendment rights, imposing content- and viewpoint-based \n22  burdens on those rights, and unconstitutionally coercing Harvard to suppress free speech and academic \n23 \n \n109 Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump) (Apr. 16, 2025 7:05AM) \n24 \nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114347313852363347. \n25  110 Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Truth Social (Apr. 24, 2025, 6:33 AM) \nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114393194962253226.  \n26  111 President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 2025 WL 2528380, at *6. \n112 Id. at *7. \n27 \n113 Id. \n114 Id. at *8. \n28 \n115 Id. at *1, *10. \n  - 39 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 48 of 123\n \n \n1  freedom, and that the defendants violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to comply \n2  with the statute’s required procedures prior to terminating the grants, and that the grant terminations \n3  were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”).  \n4  184.  On  April  21,  2025,  the  President  and  Fellows  of  Harvard  College  \n5  filed its own suit against the Trump administration, asserting claims similar to those asserted in the AAUP \n6  complaint as well as an unconstitutional conditions claim, and seeking to vacate and set aside the various \n7  termination letters and freeze orders. The two actions were consolidated and proceeded directly to \n8  summary judgment, with all parties agreeing to expedited briefing.116  \n9  185.  On May 28, 2025, President Trump expressed his intent to retaliate against Harvard for \n10  refusing to accede to the administration’s demands and instead filing suit, stating “every time [Harvard] \n11  fight[s], they lose another $250 million.”117 \n12  186.  On  September  3,  2025,  the  district  court  issued  a  decision  vacating  the  various \n13  termination letters and freeze orders as violating the First Amendment, Title VI and the APA. The court \n14  enjoined “any other termination, fund freezes, stop work orders, or otherwise withholding payment on \n15  existing grants or other federal funding, or refusing to award future grants, contracts, or other federal \n16  funding to Harvard in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on any purported \n17  grounds of discrimination without compliance with the terms of Title VI.”118  \n18  187.  The court’s factual findings were based primarily on the administrative record filed in the \n19  case.119 The court found that, through its demands in the April 11, 2025 letter, the federal government \n20  impermissibly sought to impose ideological control over Harvard: “In brief, the April 11 Letter purported \n21  to require Harvard to overhaul its governance, hiring, and academic programs to comport with the \n22  government’s ideology and prescribed viewpoint.”120 The court further found that the April 11 letter \n23  conditioned the grants on Harvard “acceding to the government’s demands” for ideological control.121  \n24 \n \n25  116 Id. at *10. \n117 Id. at *9. \n26 \n118 Id. at *38. \n119 Id. at *1 n.2. \n27 \n120 Id. at *23. \n28  121 Id. at *24; see also id. at *27 (defendants “condition[ed] Harvard’s federal funding … on Harvard’s \nrealigning its campus to better reflect a viewpoint favored by the government”). \n  - 40 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 49 of 123\n \n \n1  188.  This attempted ideological control included “whether Harvard was ‘vetting students who \n2  are coming in from outside of the country to make sure they’re not activists’ and ‘vetting professors that \n3  [it is] hiring to make sure that they’re not teaching ideologies.’”122 The court pointed out that the \n4  government “specifically conditioned funding on agreeing to its ten terms, ... six related to ideological \n5  and pedagogical concerns, including who may lead and teach at Harvard, who may be admitted, and \n6  what may be taught.”123 \n7  189.  Similarly,  the  court  concluded  that  “Defendants  unconstitutionally  sought  to  force \n8  Harvard to better manifest the government’s favored worldview … To do so, Defendants … urged and \n9  threatened Harvard … to hire faculty and make curricula and research choices that better aligned with \n10  the government’s preferred viewpoints, to the detriment of professors and researchers with competing \n11  views.”124 Thus, “Defendants required the [AAUP and UAW] members to rebalance and alter their \n12  speech to save Harvard’s funding.”125 \n13  190.   The court further “found that the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters resulted from \n14  Harvard’s exercise of its First Amendment rights,” noting that “the conditions here are particularly \n15  concerning because, as discussed, many of them were based on Harvard’s ‘particular beliefs,’ Nat’l Rifle \n16  Ass’n of Am. v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175, 188 (2024), and sought to dictate the content of speech on campus \n17  and the ‘particular views taken by speakers on [particular] subject[s],’ Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors \n18  of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995).”126 \n19  191.  The court also rejected the federal government’s argument that its actions were based on \n20  fighting antisemitism: “The idea that fighting antisemitism is Defendants’ true aim is belied by the fact \n21  that the majority of the demands they are making of Harvard to restore its research funding are directed, \n22  on their face, at Harvard's governance, staffing and hiring practices, and admissions policies—all of \n23  which have little to do with antisemitism and everything to do with Defendants’ power and political \n24  views.”127 The court pointed out that the government “specifically conditioned funding on agreeing to \n25   \n122 Id. at *25 n.22. \n26 \n123 Id. at *24. \n124 Id. at *27. \n27 \n125 Id. \n28  126 Id. at *26. \n127 Id. at *37. \n  - 41 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 50 of 123\n \n \n1  its ten terms, only one of which related to antisemitism, while six related to ideological and pedagogical \n2  concerns.”128 At base, “the government-initiated onslaught against Harvard was much more about \n3  promoting a governmental orthodoxy in violation of the First Amendment than about anything else, \n4  including fighting antisemitism.”129 \n5  192.  The court concluded that “what lies at the core of this dispute is the fact that Defendants \n6  are trying to pressure Harvard to accede to the government's demands in a way that squarely violates \n7  Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and ignores the procedural requirements of Title VI and, to a certain \n8  extent, the APA.”130 The court found there was “little connection between the research affected by the \n9  grant terminations and antisemitism,” and that “a review of the administrative record makes it difficult \n10  to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, \n11  ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities, and did so in a way that runs afoul \n12  of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI.”131 \n \n13 \nIV. Defendants Conduct Pretextual Investigations, Unlawfully Terminate Funding, and \nMake Extortionate Threats in Attempt to Coerce the UC into Sacrificing the \n14 \nConstitutional and State Law Rights of Its Faculty, Students, Academic Employees, \n15  and Staff.  \n193.  On May 9, 2025, DOJ, through the Educational Opportunities Section of the Civil Rights \n16 \nDivision, notified the UC that it had opened an investigation “into the University of California System’s \n17 \n(UC  or  UC  System)  response  to  incidents  of  antisemitic  discrimination,  harassment,  abuse,  and \n18 \nretaliation against students that occurred within the educational environment of the UC System.”132  \n19 \n194.  On July 29, 2025, DOJ issued a  “Notice of Findings Regarding the University of \n20 \nCalifornia, Los Angeles” (“Notice of Findings”), in which DOJ stated, “[W]e have found that UCLA’s \n21 \nresponse to its students’ complaints of antisemitism on UCLA’s campus violated its obligations under \n22 \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n23 \n42 U.S.C. §2000d (Title VI).”133 The Notice of Findings’ conclusion related specifically to “UCLA’s \n24 \n \n25  128 Id. at *24. \n129 Id. at *25. \n26 \n130 Id. at *37. \n131 Id. at *36. \n27 \n132 Letter from Harmeet K.

The Notice of Findings stated that “[t]he Department’s investigation of the greater UC \n4  System remains ongoing,” and that “[t]he Department has not yet reached a conclusion regarding \n5  whether any other UC System school has violated the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI, as those \n6  investigations are still ongoing.”135 The Notice of Findings also asserted that the investigation into \n7  allegations of discrimination against Jewish and Israeli students that resulted in the Notice “is separate \n8  and distinct from [DOJ’s] investigations relating to the University of California’s admissions practices \n9  and allegations of employment discrimination.”136  \n10  196.  The following day, on July 30, 2025, three Funding Agency Defendants—NIH, NSF, and \n11  DOE—summarily cut off a combined $584 million in research funds from UCLA.  \n12  197.  On  July  30,  2025,  NSF  sent  UCLA  a  letter  with  the  subject  “Notice  of  Award \n13  Suspensions,” identifying approximately 300 awards worth a combined total of approximately $170 \n14  million, with $90 million remaining unspent, and stating that, “Effective immediately, the attached \n15  awards are suspended until further notice.”137 The July 30 NSF letter stated that it reflects “the final \n16  agency decision and [is] not subject to appeal” and that the decision was made “on the basis that the \n17  awards no longer effectuate program goals or agency priorities.”138 \n18  198.  On August 1, 2025, NSF sent an “Updated Notice of Award Suspensions” to UCLA, \n19  which “officially notified [UCLA] that the [NSF] is hereby suspending the attached list of grant awards \n20  to the [UCLA],” and directed UCLA to “immediately cease all activities on these award numbers.” The \n21  stated basis for the indefinite suspension was purportedly “to address concerns reported and observed in \n22  UCLA programs and ensure compliance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations, and the terms \n23  and conditions of the[] Federal awards.” The Updated Notice stated that it was effective July 30, 2025.  \n24   \n134 Id. at 3-6.  \n25  135 Id. at 1.  \n136 Id.  \n26 \n137 Thakur, Dkt. 79-1; Molly Shan, NSF Grant Suspensions at UCLA total $90M lost in value, Grant \nWitness (Aug. 1, 2025), https://grant-witness.us/posts/UCLA-new-terminations/; Mikhail Zinshteyn, \n27 \nUCLA research grants suspended after Trump administration faulted campus for antisemitism, Cal \nMatters (Jul. 31, 2025), https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/07/ucla/. \n28 \n138 Thakur, Dkt. 79-1.  \n  - 43 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 52 of 123\n \n \n1  199.  The August 1 letter stated that, “[b]ased on UCLA’s failure to comply with federal \n2  requirements, policies and procedures, NSF is suspending the attached award[,]” and that “NSF has \n3  identified the following specific examples of noncompliance: [(1)] UCLA engages in racism, in the form \n4  of illegal race-based preferences in admissions practices; [(2)] UCLA fails to promote a research \n5  environment free of antisemitism and bias; [(3)] UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by \n6  allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.”139   \n7  200.  In particular, the letter stated NSF’s “belie[f] that UCLA’s ‘holistic review’ admissions \n8  process, which considers factors such as an applicant’s neighborhood/zip code, family income, and \n9  school profile—and invites the disclosure of an applicant’s race via personal statements—is a transparent \n10  attempt to engage in race-based admissions in all but name.”140 It cited “UCLA’s own Task Force to \n11  Combat Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias” as revealing anti-Semitic incidents “antithetical to the safe \n12  and welcoming environment for effective research.”141 And it expressed “serious[] concern[]” that \n13  UCLA was “allowing males to compete in women’s sports and utilize women-only facilities, … \n14  create[ing] an unsafe environment for women that further threatens the integrity of the campus research \n15  environment.”142 \n16  201.  In an August 4, 2025 court filing in Thakur v. Trump, Case 3:25-cv-04737-RFL (N.D. \n17  Cal.), NSF stated that the July 30 and August 1 grant suspensions were based on “findings by the \n18  Department of Justice that UCLA violated federal civil rights law.”143 The Thakur court held that the \n19  suspensions violated its June 23, 2025 preliminary injunction, which barred the termination of grants \n20  with insufficiently specific explanations, and vacated those terminations.144 \n21  202.  Like NSF, on July 31, NIH sent a letter notifying UCLA that NIH was suspending \n22  hundreds of grant awards to UCLA, based on the same three conclusions of noncompliance listed in the \n23 \n24 \n \n25  139 Thakur, Dkt. 79-2. \n140 Id.  \n26  141 Id. \n142 Id. \n27 \n143 Id. \n28  144 Thakur, Dkt. 96 at 7-8; see also id. at 11-12 (explaining that if preliminary injunction did not cover \nthese grant terminations, modification would be appropriate). \n  - 44 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 53 of 123\n \n \n1  August 1 NSF letter (in near-identical language): that UCLA was guilty of “illegal affirmative action,” \n2  “antisemitism and bias,” and “discriminat[ion] against and endanger[ing of] women.”145   \n3  203.  NIH provided the same explanation as did NSF regarding its concern about UCLA’s \n4  “holistic  review”  admissions  process,  elaborating  that  “UCLA’s  surreptitious—and  unlawful—\n5  prioritization of race over merit has significantly disadvantaged white and Asian applicants and must \n6  end.”146 “With respect to antisemitism,” NIH, like NSF, cited to UCLA’s Antisemitism Task Force, and \n7  also to the Republican Staff Report of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and \n8  the Workforce regarding antisemitism on 11 university campuses.147 NIH’s letter repeated concerns \n9  about  transgender  students,  warning  that  “NIH  cannot  sit  idly  by  as  a  major  grants  recipient \n10  systematically marginalizes its female students, faculty, and staff by stripping away necessities, like safe \n11  and secure bathrooms, and extracurricular opportunities.”148 \n12  204.  A motion to enjoin the NIH grant terminations is pending in the Thakur case, with a \n13  hearing set for September 18, 2025. \n14  205.  On July 30 or 31, 2025, the DOE suspended two UCLA grant awards. On information \n15  and belief, DOE sent similar letters basing the grant terminations on the same three noncompliance \n16  conditions on which NSF and NIH relied, namely, (1) race-based preferences in admissions practices, \n17  (2) the failure to promote an environment free of antisemitism and bias, and (3) discrimination against \n18  women by permitting transgender women to participate in extracurricular activities and to use women’s \n19  facilities. \n20 \nA.  Defendants  Disregard  Title  VI  Statutory  and  Regulatory  Requirements \nConstraining Termination of and Refusal to Grant Federal Funding. \n21 \n206.  NSF, NIH, and DOE terminated $584 million in grant funds to UCLA based on the DOJ’s \n22 \nfinding that UCLA had violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination \n23 \non the basis of race, color, or national origin in all programs receiving federal funding. 42 U.S.C. §2000d \n24 \n(“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from \n25 \n \n26  145 Thakur, Dkt. 118-1 at 2. \n146 Id. at 2-3 (citing a complaint filed in the Central District of California and a 2012 article by Richard \n27 \nSander). \n147 Id. at 3 (citing UCLA Task Force and Republican Staff Report). \n28 \n148 Id.  \n  - 45 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 54 of 123\n \n \n1  participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \n2  receiving Federal financial assistance.”). \n3  207.  Section 602 of Title VI, however, prescribes specific procedural requirements that federal \n4  agencies must follow before taking “any action terminating, or refusing to grant or continue, [federal \n5  financial] assistance because of failure to comply with [Section 601].” 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1.  \n6  208.  First, the agency must provide the funding recipient with notice of the alleged violation. \n7  But that is only the first step. The agency must then attempt to secure the funding recipient’s voluntary \n8  compliance. If the agency “has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,” then \n9  it must make “an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with \n10  [Section 601].” Id. Even then, it still cannot terminate funds. Rather, Section 602 provides that the agency \n11  must then “file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the \n12  program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action,” \n13  and “[n]o [terminating] action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of \n14  such report.” Id. \n15  209.  Section 602 further limits the scope of funding that the agency may terminate after \n16  exhausting all these mandatory procedures, providing that any “termination or refusal [to grant or to \n17  continue assistance under Title VI] shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or \n18  other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and, shall be limited in its effect to the particular \n19  program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.” Id. (emphasis added). \n20  210.   These stringent procedural requirements and scope limitations for termination or refusal \n21  to grant or continue assistance reflect congressional intent to safeguard against the potential exploitation \n22  of Title VI funding leverage as a “vindictive or punitive” measure against federal funding recipients.149 \n23  From the very inception of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, lawmakers were aware of and concerned about \n24  the far-reaching authority Title VI grants the federal government over programs receiving federal funds. \n25  The congressional notice requirement, presidential approval of agency regulations implementing Title \n26 \n27   \n149 88 Cong. Rec. 7063 (1964) (statement of Senator Pastore), \n28  https://www.congress.gov/88/crecb/1964/04/07/GPO-CRECB-1964-pt6-1-1.pdf, \nhttps://perma.cc/95VE-5QL8. \n  - 46 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 55 of 123\n \n \n1  VI (discussed below), and requirement for a hearing on the record were all introduced as amendments \n2  to the original bill and were expressly aimed at preventing abuses of power.150 \n3  211.  Senator John Pastore from Rhode Island, who was the floor manager in the Senate for the \n4  Civil Rights Act of 1964, explained that “Failure of a recipient to comply with a rule, regulation, or order \n5  issued by an agency may ultimately lead to a termination or refusal of Federal assistance. Cutoff of \n6  assistance is not the object of title VI, however. I wish to repeat: Cutoff of assistance is not the objective \n7  of title VI. Fund cutoff is a last resort, to be used only if all else fails to achieve the real objective—the \n8  elimination of discrimination in the use and receipt of Federal funds.”151 \n9  212.  Senator Pastore further elaborated on the importance of the statutory and regulatory \n10  safeguards in ensuring that revocation of funding was “a last resort” rather than a “punitive or vindictive \n11  measure,” noting that “cutoff of funds would not be consistent with the objective of the Federal \n12  assistance statutes if other effective means of ending discrimination are available.”152 \n13  213.  Section 602 “direct[s]” federal agencies to “issu[e] rules, regulations, or orders of general \n14  applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the \n15  financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken.” 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1. Agencies are \n16  required to seek approval of those regulations from the President, id., who has delegated that authority \n17  to the Attorney General. The Attorney General oversees and coordinates enforcement of Title VI among \n18  federal agencies. See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 12250 (1980) at §§1–2; Exec. Order 11764, 3A C.F.R. §124 \n19  (1974 Comp.); Exec. Order 11247, 3 C.F.R. 1964–1965 Comp. 348 (Sept. 24, 1965). \n20  214.  Pursuant to Section 602, and consistent with this legislative intent, DOJ, NSF, HHS \n21  (whose regulations bind NIH), DOE, and other defendant agencies have promulgated regulations \n22  imposing  additional  procedural  requirements  on  the  termination  of  federal  funding  for  alleged \n23  noncompliance with Section 601. \n24 \n \n25  150 See 88 Cong. Rec. 2498 (1964) (statement of Rep. Willis); id. at 2499, 2505 (statements of Rep. \nLindsay),  https://www.congress.gov/88/crecb/1964/02/07/GPO-CRECB-1964-pt2-8-2.pdf, \n26 \nhttps://perma.cc/WJK5-8K7G. \n151  88  Cong.

These regulations typically provide that “[n]o order suspending, terminating or refusing \n2  to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until: (1) The responsible \n3  Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined \n4  that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) There has been an express finding on the \n5  record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a \n6  requirement imposed by or pursuant to this subpart, … and ([3]) The expiration of 30 days after the [head \n7  of the agency] has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having \n8  legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the \n9  grounds for such action.” 28 C.F.R. §42.108(c) (DOJ); see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.8(c) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. \n10  §80.8(c) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1 (applying the HHS implementing regulations for \n11  Title VI); 10 C.F.R. §1040.114 (DOE). \n12  216.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to comply with the foregoing requirements \n13  before terminating funding on July 30-August 1. Among other things, Defendants did not attempt to \n14  secure the UC’s voluntary compliance, or determine that such compliance could not be achieved, before \n15  terminating $584 million in federal grants. Defendants did not provide an opportunity for hearing or \n16  make an express finding on the record as to the University’s noncompliance with Title VI. Nor did any \n17  “responsible Department official” determine that the University’s compliance could not be secured by \n18  voluntary means. Moreover, no head of any Federal department or agency has filed with any committees \n19  of the House and Senate a “full report of the circumstances and the grounds” for the action terminating \n20  or refusing to grant or continue federal assistance to the University because of a failure to comply with \n21  Title VI. Nor have thirty days elapsed after the filing of any such report.   \n22  217.  Additionally, Title VI regulations typically impose requirements on the conduct of pre-\n23  termination  hearings.  Among  other  requirements,  “[w]henever  an  opportunity  for  a  hearing  is \n24  required … reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to \n25  the affected applicant or recipient. That notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action \n26  proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, \n27  and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for that action. The notice shall (1) Fix a date not less \n28  than 20 days after the date of such notice, within which the applicant or recipient may request that the \n  - 48 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 57 of 123\n \n \n1  responsible Department official schedule the matter for hearing, or (2) advise the applicant or recipient \n2  that a hearing concerning the matter in question has been scheduled and advise the applicant or recipient \n3  of the place and time of that hearing.” 28 C.F.R. §42.109(a) (DOJ); see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.9(a) (NSF); \n4  45 C.F.R. §80.9(a) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. 10 C.F.R. §1040.121 (DOE) \n5  (establishing similar requirements regarding notice of opportunity for hearing). \n6  218.  Those regulations also typically further provide that “[t]he hearing, decision, and any \n7  administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5–8 of \n8  the Administrative Procedure Act),” and that “[b]oth the Department and the applicant or recipient shall \n9  be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as \n10  determined by the officer conducting the hearing.” 28 C.F.R. §42.109(d)(1) (DOJ); see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. \n11  §611.9(d)(1) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.9(d)(1) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1. All such \n12  evidence “shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and \n13  arguments advanced on either side of the issues,” and “[a] transcript shall be made of the oral evidence \n14  except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record.” 28 C.F.R. §42.109(d)(2) (DOJ); \n15  see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.9(d)(2) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.9(d)(2) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement \n16  4.1.2.1. \n17  219.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to comply with the foregoing procedures \n18  governing pre-termination hearings. Among other things, Defendants did not conduct a hearing at all or \n19  provide any notice. \n20  220.  These regulations also impose requirements regarding post-hearing termination decisions \n21  and notices. For example, “[i]f the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, such hearing examiner shall \n22  either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record, including his recommended \n23  findings and proposed decision, to the [responsible Department official] for a final decision, and a copy \n24  of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient.” 28 C.F.R. §42.110(a) \n25  (DOJ); see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.10(a) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.10(a) (HHS);  NIH Grants Policy Statement \n26  4.1.2.1. \n27  221.  Moreover, “[e]ach decision of a hearing officer or responsible Department official shall \n28  set  forth  his  ruling  on  each  findings,  conclusion,  or  exception  presented,  and  shall  identify  the \n  - 49 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 58 of 123\n \n \n1  requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart with which it is found that the \n2  applicant or recipient has failed to comply.” 28 C.F.R. §42.110(d) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §611.10(d) (NSF); \n3  45 C.F.R. §80.10(d) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. 10 C.F.R. §1040.121(b) (DOE) \n4  (“An applicant or recipient may ... waive or fail to request a hearing, without waiving the requirement \n5  for findings of fact and conclusions of law.”). And “[w]henever a record is certified to the responsible \n6  Department official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner ... the applicant or \n7  recipient shall be given a reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its \n8  contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible Department official shall be given in \n9  writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.” 28 C.F.R. §42.110(b) (DOJ); see, \n10  e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.10(b) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.10(b) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. \n11  10 C.F.R. §1040.121(b) (DOE) (“[T]he applicant or recipient may also submit written information or \n12  argument for the record if he/she does not request a hearing.”). \n13  222.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to issue a decision consistent with the \n14  foregoing regulations. Among other things, Defendants did not provide the UC with a reasonable \n15  opportunity to file briefs or other written statements of its contentions.  \n16  223.  These Title VI regulations further provide that “[a]ny action to suspend or terminate or \n17  to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political \n18  entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall \n19  be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been \n20  so found.” 28 C.F.R. §42.108(c) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §611.8 (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.8(c) (HHS);  NIH Grants \n21  Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; 10 C.F.R. §1040.114(e) (DOE). \n22  224.  Defendants did not limit the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawals to any particular \n23  program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Nor was such withdrawal limited in \n24  its effect to any particular program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Rather, the \n25  withdrawal—and the effect of such withdrawal—is widespread and reaches departments and individuals, \n26  including Plaintiffs’ members, as to whom there has been no finding of noncompliance.  \n27  225.  Defendants’ failure to comply with Section 602 and the Defendant agencies’ respective \n28  regulations is not authorized by any law. \n  - 50 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 59 of 123\n \n \nB.  Defendants  Disregard  Title  IX  Statutory  and  Regulatory  Requirements \n1 \nConstraining Termination of and Refusal to Grant Federal Funding. \n2 \n226.  In summarily terminating $584 million in grant funds to UCLA, NSF, NIH, and DOE \n3 \ncited as an additional basis UCLA’s purported discrimination on the basis of sex, which is prohibited in \n4 \neducation programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance by Section 901 of Title IX of \n5 \nthe Civil Rights Act. 20 U.S.C. §1681(a). \n6 \n227.  Section 902 of Title IX, however, prescribes specific procedural requirements that federal \n7 \nagencies must follow before taking “any action terminating, or refusing to grant or continue, [federal \n8 \nfinancial] assistance because of failure to comply with [Section 901].” 20 U.S.C. §1682.  \n9 \n228.  First, the agency must provide the funding recipient with notice of the alleged violation. \n10 \nBut that is only the first step. The agency must then attempt to secure the funding recipient’s voluntary \n11 \ncompliance. If the agency “has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,” then \n12 \nit must make “an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with \n13 \n[Section 901].” Id. Even then, it still cannot terminate funds. Rather, Section 902 provides that the agency \n14 \nmust then “file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the \n15 \nprogram or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action,” \n16 \nand “[n]o [terminating] action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of \n17 \nsuch report.” Id. \n18 \n229.  Section 902 further limits the scope of funding that the agency may terminate after \n19 \nexhausting all these mandatory procedures, providing that any “termination or refusal [to grant or to \n20 \ncontinue assistance under Title IX] shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or \n21 \nother recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and, shall be limited in its effect to the particular \n22 \nprogram, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.” Id. (emphasis added). \n23 \n230.  These stringent procedural requirements and scope limitations are identical to the Title \n24 \nVI procedural requirements that, as discussed above, reflect congressional intent to safeguard against the \n25 \npotential exploitation of federal funding leverage as a “vindictive or punitive” measure against federal \n26 \nfunding recipients. The congressional notice requirement, presidential approval of agency regulations \n27 \nimplementing Title IX (discussed below), and requirement for a hearing on the record all mirror the Title \n28 \nVI requirements expressly aimed at preventing abuses of power. \n  - 51 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 60 of 123\n \n \n1  231.  Section 902 “direct[s]” federal agencies to “issu[e] rules, regulations, or orders of general \n2  applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the \n3  financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken.” 20 U.S.C. §1682. Agencies are \n4  required to seek approval of those regulations from the President, id., who has delegated that authority \n5  to the Attorney General, see Exec. Order No. 12250 (1980) at §1-102. The Attorney General oversees \n6  and coordinates enforcement of Title IX among federal agencies. Id. at §1-2. \n7  232.  Pursuant to Section 902, and consistent with this legislative intent, DOJ, NSF, HHS \n8  (whose regulations bind NIH), DOE, and other defendant agencies have promulgated regulations \n9  imposing  additional  procedural  requirements  on  the  termination  of  federal  funding  for  alleged \n10  noncompliance with Section 901. \n11  233.  Specifically,  these  agencies  have  “adopted  and  incorporated”  into  their  Title  IX \n12  implementing regulations the “procedural provisions applicable to Title VI” described above. 28 C.F.R. \n13  §54.605 (DOJ) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 28 CFR 42.106 through 42.111”); \n14  45 C.F.R. §618.605 (NSF) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 45 CFR part 611”); 45 \n15  C.F.R. §86.71 (HHS) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 45 CFR 80.6 through 80.11 \n16  and 45 CFR part 81”); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.2 (applying the HHS implementing regulations \n17  for Title IX); 10 C.F.R. §1042.605 (DOE) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 10 \n18  CFR part 1040, subparts G and H”). \n19  234.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendants  did  not  comply  with  any  of  the  foregoing \n20  requirements before terminating funding on July 30-August 1. Among other things, Defendants did not \n21  issue to the UC a notice of findings of any alleged violations of Title IX. Defendants did not attempt to \n22  secure the UC’s voluntary compliance before terminating $584 million in federal grants or determine \n23  that such voluntary compliance could not be achieved. Defendants did not provide an opportunity for \n24  hearing or make an express finding on the record as to the University’s noncompliance with Title IX. \n25  Nor did any “responsible Department official” determine that the University’s compliance could not be \n26  secured by voluntary means. Moreover, no head of any Federal department or agency has filed with any \n27  committees of the House and Senate a “full report of the circumstances and the grounds” for the action \n28 \n  - 52 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 61 of 123\n \n \n1  terminating or refusing to grant or continue federal assistance to the University because of a failure to \n2  comply with Title IX. Nor have thirty days elapsed after the filing of any such report. \n3  235.  Nor has any “responsible Department official or his designee” sought to resolve the \n4  University’s alleged violations of Section 901 through informal means before termination of funding by \n5  Defendants NSF and NIH, even though such informal resolution may have been possible. \n6  236.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to comply with the foregoing procedures \n7  governing pre-termination hearings. Among other things, Defendants did not conduct a hearing at all or \n8  provide any notice. \n9  237.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to issue a decision consistent with the \n10  foregoing regulations. Among other things, Defendants did not provide the UC with a reasonable \n11  opportunity to file briefs or other written statements of its contentions. \n12  238.  Defendants did not limit the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawals to any particular \n13  program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Nor was such withdrawal limited in \n14  its effect to any particular program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Rather, the \n15  withdrawal—and the effect of such withdrawal—is widespread and reaches departments and individuals, \n16  including Plaintiffs’ members, as to whom there has been no finding of noncompliance.  \n17  239.  Defendants’ failure to comply with Section 902 and the Defendant agencies’ respective \n18  regulations is not authorized by any law. \n \n19 \nC.  Defendants  Fail  to  Provide  a  Reasoned  Decision  for  Terminating  $584 \nMillion in Research Grants. \n20 \n240.  Defendants failed to provide any reasoned basis for their actions.  \n21 \n241.  Defendants’ July 29 Notice of Findings, NSF and NIH grant termination letters, the \n22 \nAugust 8 Demand Letter, and, on information and belief, the DOE grant termination communication do \n23 \nnot  identify  any  specific  evidence  of  any  antisemitic  harassment  to  which  UC  was  deliberately \n24 \nindifferent, any specific evidence of race-based or gender discrimination, or any other evidence of \n25 \nwrongdoing. \n26 \n242.  Defendants have not acknowledged the efforts UCLA and other campuses in the UC \n27 \nSystem are making to address alleged antisemitism and prevent racial discrimination in admissions. UC \n28 \n  - 53 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 62 of 123\n \n \n1  has issued a number of statements, studies, reports, and policy changes in response to complaints of \n2  antisemitism and discrimination on campus. Those have included the launch in 2024 of a Systemwide \n3  Office of Civil Rights,153 a systemwide Anti-Discrimination Policy,154 and a systemwide directive on \n4  policies impacting expressive activities.155 \n5  243.  Additionally, on December 20, 2024, the UC System announced it had entered into a \n6  voluntary agreement with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) to resolve \n7  claims of discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry, including shared Jewish, Israeli, \n8  Palestinian,  Arab,  and  Muslim  ancestry,  and  ensure  compliance  with  Title  VI.156  The  voluntary \n9  agreement relates to complaints of discrimination at the UCLA campus, as well as at the UC Davis, UC \n10  San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz campuses. The agreement established several \n11  reporting and review frameworks between the UCs and the OCR regarding anti-discrimination policy \n12  and campus safety, including responses to a protest or demonstration on a University campus. For \n13  example, pursuant to the voluntary agreement, UC agreed to provide any proposed revision to its \n14  systemwide anti-discrimination policies and procedures to OCR for its review and approval and to \n15  provide  annual  investigator  training  related  to  discrimination  and  harassment  based  on  actual  or \n16  perceived  national  origin,  including  shared  Jewish,  Palestinian,  Muslim,  and/or  Arab  ancestry  or \n17  association with these national origins/ancestries. Under the voluntary agreement, “[i]f OCR has any \n18  concerns  about  the  adequacy  of  the  University’s  rationale  to  not  open  an  investigation  or  its \n19  investigations or any of its proposed remedial or corrective actions, OCR will communicate those \n20  concerns to the University in writing[,]” and “the University will respond to address OCR’s concerns \n21 \n \n22 \n153 Systemwide Office of Civil Rights, Univ. of Cal.

Defendants’ July 29 Notice of Findings, funding termination letters, and August 8 \n4  Demand Letter do not explain why the procedures, reporting, and commitments that are set forth in the \n5  December 20, 2024 voluntary agreement are insufficient to address the allegations of antisemitism \n6  contained in those findings, termination letters, and demand. The Notice of Findings merely notes a \n7  December 20, 2024 agreement as a document DOJ reviewed, explains the concerns raised by OCR, and \n8  fails entirely to acknowledge steps OCR and UC agreed to in that voluntary agreement.158 Defendants’ \n9  failure to do so is unreasonable and arbitrary given that the July 29 Notice of Findings, along with the \n10  funding termination letters and August 8 Demand Letter, cite only to events that occurred prior to the \n11  OCR’s December 20 voluntary agreement with UC and are addressed by the provisions of the voluntary \n12  agreement. The Notice of Findings, funding termination letters, and August 8 Demand Letter do not \n13  identify any specific allegations of antisemitism that were not addressed by the December 20, 2024 \n14  voluntary agreement; nor do they state that the December 20, 2024 voluntary agreement has been \n15  insufficient to address the allegations of antisemitism, including those set forth in the October 2024 \n16  report of the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias at UCLA. \n17  245.  Defendants have also failed, in issuing the Notice of Findings, the funding terminations, \n18  and the August 8 Demand Letter, to address actions taken by UCLA as part of and pursuant to a \n19  settlement of Frankel v. Regents of University of California. That lawsuit, filed June 5, 2024 by three \n20  Jewish students from UCLA and a UCLA professor against the Regents, claimed that UCLA had \n21  subjected Jewish students to discrimination and a hostile environment in violation of Title VI of the Civil \n22  Rights Act.159 In settling this litigation, UC agreed to be bound by a Consent Judgment and Permanent \n23  Injunction prohibiting UCLA from offering any programs, activities, or campus areas that are not fully \n24  and equally accessible to Jewish students, faculty, and/or staff as to other students, faculty, and/or staff, \n25  and,  among  other  things,  agreed  to  contribute  $2.33  million  to  eight  organizations  that  combat \n26   \n157 University of California Resolution Agreement, supra note 156. \n27  158 U.S. Department of Justice Notice of Findings Regarding the University of California, Los Angeles, \nat 2 & n.2 (July 29, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1409416/dl?inline. \n28 \n159 Compl., Frankel v.

In announcing the \n4  Frankel settlement, UC also identified other steps it had taken to combat antisemitism.161  \n5  246.  The Frankel settlement was executed on July 28 and was publicly released by no later \n6  than July 29, 2025. Nonetheless, DOJ issued its Notice of Findings that UCLA was in violation of Title \n7  VI due to allegations of antisemitism on campus on July 29, 2025. The Notice of Findings did not address \n8  the Frankel settlement or the UCLA Initiative to Combat Antisemitism; nor has DOJ or any Defendant \n9  subsequently  addressed  the  impact  of  the  Frankel  settlement,  the  UCLA  Initiative  to  Combat \n10  Antisemitism, or any other of the actions UCLA and UC have implemented to address allegations of \n11  antisemitism. The Notice of Findings states that DOJ reviewed the “pleadings and other materials \n12  referenced” in Frankel,162 but makes no reference to the settlement. \n13  247.  Similarly,  on  July  30,  July  31,  and  August  1,  Defendants  NSF  and  NIH,  and  on \n14  information and belief DOE, issued letters withdrawing funding from UCLA purportedly on the basis of \n15  complaints  about  antisemitism  on  campus  without  addressing  the  December  20,  2024  voluntary \n16  agreement between UC and OCR, the Frankel settlement, the UCLA Initiative to Combat Antisemitism, \n17  or any other steps UC identified as addressing these complaints.  \n18  248.  DOJ, in its Notice of Findings, relies heavily on the UCLA Task Force Report from \n19  October  2024,  but  does  not  acknowledge,  let  alone  address,  the  UCLA  Initiative  to  Combat \n20  Antisemitism, which seeks to implement the recommendations of the Task Force Report. DOJ provides \n21  no explanation of its failure to do so. \n22  249.  The Notice of Findings is based entirely on events in the spring of 2024 related to an \n23  encampment on UCLA’s campus to protest Israel’s military actions in Gaza and student complaints \n24 \n \n25  160 Settlement Agreement and Release of Claims (July 28, 2025),  \nhttps://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/2025-07/frankel-settlement-agreement-fully-\n26  executed-w-ex-a.pdf; Julio Frenk, Chancellor, Initiative to Combat Antisemitism, Univ. of Cal.

And yet DOJ, in its July 29, 2025 Notice of Findings, \n3  does not cite to or consider any steps taken by UC and/or UCLA since May 2, 2024 to address complaints \n4  of antisemitism and discrimination. \n5  250.  NSF cites no factual or legal basis for its suspension of awards in its July 30, 2025 letter. \n6  In its August 1, 2025 Updated Notice, NSF purports to base the award suspensions on concerns regarding \n7  antisemitism “during the 2024 pro-Palestinian encampment,” citing solely to the UCLA Task Force \n8  report as evidence of “noncompliance” with “applicable Federal statutes and regulations” “[w]ith respect \n9  to  antisemitism.”164  NIH  similarly  cites  to  the  UCLA  Task  Force  findings  as  evidence  of  non-\n10  compliance. Yet neither NSF nor NIH addresses, or even acknowledges, the UCLA Initiative to Combat \n11  Antisemitism, or any other steps the UC and/or UCLA have taken to address the findings of the Task \n12  Force. NIH’s July 31, 2025 letter suspending grant awards also cites, “[w]ith respect to antisemitism,” a \n13  Republican Staff Report that investigated antisemitism on 11 university campuses and which includes \n14  information regarding the events at UCLA in late April and early May 2024.165  \n15  251.  Defendants  have  not  made  a  reasoned  determination  whether  UC’s  and  UCLA’s \n16  responses to complaints of antisemitism and discrimination on campus were or were not sufficient under \n17  Title VI, and Defendants did not make any such determination prior to sending the July 29 Findings, the \n18  funding termination letters, or the August 8 Demand Letter.  \n19  252.   The NIH and NSF funding termination letters and, on information and belief, the DOE \n20  funding termination letter, cite concerns about UCLA’s “holistic review” admissions process and asserts \n21  that it is “a transparent attempt to engage in race-based admissions in all but name.”166 NSF and NIH, \n22  however, recognize that “UCLA expressly disclaims reliance on race.” That UCLA may consider an \n23  applicant’s zip code or personal statement is not unlawful and the funding termination letters do not \n24  come close to establishing the presence of unlawful race-based admissions processes. The agencies’ \n25   \n163 Notice of Findings, supra note 158, at 3-6. \n26 \n164 Thakur, Dkt. 79-2 at 2-3 (Aug. 1, 2025 NSF letter). \n165 Thakur, Dkt. 118-1 at 3 (July 31, 2025 NIH letter, citing Republican Staff Report, \n27 \nhttps://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/10.30.24_committee_on_education_and_the_workforce_r\n28  epublican_staff_report_-_antisemitism_on_college_campuses_exposed.pdf). \n166 Thakur, Dkt. 79-2 at 1; Thakur, Dkt. 118-1 at 2-3. \n  - 57 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 66 of 123\n \n \n1  citation to UCLA websites explaining its admissions process is simply not a reasonable basis for finding \n2  that UCLA has engaged in unlawful practices. NIH also cites to allegations in a First Amended \n3  Complaint filed in June 2025 in the District Court for the Central District of California, Students Against \n4  Racial Discrimination v. The Regents of the University of California, C.D. Case No. 8:25-cv-00192, but \n5  a complaint’s allegations are not evidence and it is unreasonable for NIH to rely on such allegations as \n6  a basis for concluding that UCLA is engaged in unlawful, race-based practices. NIH’s reliance on a 2012 \n7  article by Richard Sander is also an entirely insufficient and unreasonable basis on which to conclude \n8  that UCLA is engaged in unlawful practices. \n9  253.  The NIH and NSF funding termination letters and, on information and belief, the DOE \n10  funding termination communications, are unreasonably based on purported concerns about UCLA’s  \n11  policies allowing transgender women access to extracurricular opportunities and facilities, and apparent \n12  conclusion that these policies “fail[] to comply with federal requirements, policies, and procedures.”167  \n13  The only evidence cited by the agencies is a UCLA Gender Recognition Taskforce: Recommendations \n14  Report from 2020 and, for NIH, a 2019 map showing gender-inclusive restrooms. The Taskforce’s \n15  recommendations focus on how to address and comply with new state law and nothing in the report \n16  constitutes evidence of unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex. Defendants’ reliance on this report \n17  for its finding that UCLA has failed to comply with federal law is unreasonable and arbitrary and \n18  capricious. NIH’s additional reliance on a map of bathrooms is similarly unreasonably and arbitrary, and \n19  cannot support any finding of unlawful discrimination.     \n20  254.  Defendants also have provided no basis for the breadth of their attacks on and threats to \n21  UC’s federal funding. For example, Defendants have not explained which grants have been selected for \n22  review and potential termination and on what basis, or whether these grants have any connection to any \n23  alleged Title VI violation. Nor have Defendants identified any such connection for the grants they have \n24  terminated or for which they have declined to disburse funding since July 30, 2025. \n25  255.  The lack of any connection between Defendants’ funding freezes, threatened funding \n26  cuts, and unconstitutional conditions, and Defendants’ purported legal basis for those freezes, cuts, and \n27  conditions, has exacerbated the harm to Plaintiffs and their members, as Plaintiffs and their members do \n28   \n167 Thakur, Dkt. 79-2 at 1-2; Thakur, Dkt. 118-1 at 3-4. \n  - 58 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 67 of 123\n \n \n1  not know and cannot anticipate whether any program receiving federal funding will be impacted, \n2  requiring all such programs to prepare for the possibility of significant and immediate termination of \n3  funding. \n4  256.  Defendants  also  have  not  reasonably  considered  the  enormous  reliance  interests \n5  implicated by their freezing of hundreds of millions of dollars supporting critical research and other \n6  activities. The funding termination letters make no mention of the incalculable damage that Defendants’ \n7  actions will cause—to patients whose clinical trials will end, faculty whose careers will be derailed, \n8  research partners around the world whose studies are in jeopardy, and the public who will no longer \n9  benefit from the research those federal grants support. NIH’s and NSF’s statements that they “considered \n10  UCLA’s reliance interests in continued availability of funding” for the suspended grant awards and “they \n11  are outweighed by the concerns” identified in the funding termination letters are not supported by any \n12  reasoned analysis and are arbitrary and capricious, as the district court found in Thakur.168  \n13  257.  Defendants also have failed to explain the basis for any of the many conditions they have \n14  imposed and, on information and belief, seek to impose on UC (including on UCLA), nor have they \n15  explained how those demands would bring UC into compliance with Title VI, Title VII, or Title IX. \n16 \nD.  Defendants Demand that the UC Pay $1 Billion as Ransom, Despite No Lawful \nBasis for Demanding Such Payment.  \n17 \n258.  Shortly after Defendants abruptly cut off $584 million in grant funding, the UC reached \n18 \nout to the Department of Justice and offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the DOJ. \n19 \n259.  On or about August 8, 2025, the UC received a document (“August 8 Demand Letter”) \n20 \nfrom the DOJ demanding that UCLA pay $1 billion or more as part of a settlement to restore the $584 \n21 \nmillion that had already been cut.169 The August 8 Demand Letter specifies that if its demands are met \n22 \nthen the terminated $584 million in grants will be restored, but specifies that it does not prevent the \n23 \n24 \n \n25  168 Thakur, Dkt. 96 at 2. \n169 Statement from UC President James B.

On information and belief, there has been no finding of any Title VI (or Title VII or Title \n4  IX) violation on the record. Even if there had been, neither DOJ nor any other Defendant is authorized \n5  by law to demand a $1 billion monetary penalty for violations of Title VI, Title VII, or Title IX. \n6  261.  Upon receiving DOJ’s demands, UC President James Milliken issued a public statement \n7  that same day stating, “[A] payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest \n8  public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”170 \n9  262.  In a letter to California Legislators dated September 3, 2025, UC President Milliken \n10  described the Trump administration’s actions as posing “one of the gravest threats in UC’s 157-year \n11  history,” explaining that “[r]ecent actions by the federal government with the distinct possibility of more \n12  to come, place the entire University of California system at risk, and by extension the many Californians \n13  and communities we serve.”171 \n14  263.  As UC President Milliken explained, “the stakes are high, and the risks are very real.” \n15  The UC receives more than $17 billion per year from the federal government, including $9.9 billion in \n16  Medicare and Medicaid funding, $5.7 billion in research funding, and $1.9 billion in student financial \n17  aid per year. The UC President warned: “A substantial loss of federal funding would devastate our \n18  university and cause enormous harm to our students, our patients, and all Californians. Classes and \n19  student services would be reduced, patients would be turned away, tens of thousands of jobs would be \n20  lost, and we would see UC’s world-renowned researchers leaving our state for other more seemingly \n21  stable opportunities in the US or abroad. It is hard to conceive of a more damaging consequence for our \n22  state.”172 \n23  264.  On September 15, 2025, UC President Milliken sent an email to the entire UC community \n24  in which he addressed the Los Angeles Times’ reporting regarding the Trump administration’s “demand \n25  that  the  university  pay  the  federal  government  over  $1  billion”  and  described  the  reporting  as \n \n26 \n170 Id. \n171 Letter from James B.

Losing a sizeable portion of federal funding would have a significant impact on the UC’s \n10  budget. The UC’s operating revenue in 2024-2025 was approximately $53 billion.176 The federal \n11  government’s threats have put billions of the University’s budget at risk. The $17 billion of UC funding \n12  that UC President Milliken has identified as coming from the federal government comprises almost one-\n13  third of the UC’s budget. \n14  266.  According to UC budget documents, federal funds accounted for 52 percent of all UC \n15  research expenditures in 2023-24, and “were the University’s single most important source of support \n16  for research.”177 Similarly, “[f]ederal student aid programs represent the single largest source of financial \n17  aid for UC students.”178 \n18  / / / \n19  / / / \n \n20 \n21 \n22 \n \n23  173 James Milliken, A message from President James B.

Defendants Demand that, in Exchange for Federal Funding, the UC Agree to \n1 \nInfringe  the  Free  Speech  and  Academic  Freedom  Rights  of  Its  Faculty, \nStudents, Academic Employees, and Staff. \n2 \n3 \n267.  The August 8 Demand Letter makes a number of demands upon UCLA that would \n4 \nimpinge on the free speech and academic freedom rights of UCLA’s faculty, students,  academic \n5 \nemployees, and staff employees.179 \n6 \n268.  For example, the August 8 Demand Letter demands that UCLA prohibit demonstrations, \n7 \nprotests, displays, and other expressive activities in specified locations on the UCLA campus; prohibit \n8 \novernight demonstrations in any location; and prohibit demonstrators from wearing masks in order to \n9 \nprotest anonymously.180  \n10 \n269.  The August 8 Demand Letter makes additional demands that would inhibit speech by \n11 \nnon-citizen students, including requiring UCLA to share disciplinary records of international students \n12 \nwith  the  federal  government  and  to  implement  policies  that  ensure  it  does  not  recruit  or  admit \n13 \ninternational  students  who  are  “likely  to  engage  in  anti-Western,  anti-American,  or  antisemitic \n14 \ndisruptions or harassment,” and implement trainings to “socialize” international students to campus \n15 \nnorms.181  \n16 \n270.  On information and belief, the August 8 Demand Letter also demands cooperation with \n17 \nlocal and federal law enforcement and does not except cooperation with federal immigration authorities \n18 \nfrom this demand. \n19 \n271.  The August 8 Demand Letter demands appointment of a resolution monitor and gives \n20 \nthat monitor significant authority over campus affairs; if UCLA and the administration cannot reach \n21 \nagreement on who should be appointed as that monitor, the letter demands that the administration have \n22 \nthe authority to appoint that individual.182 \n23 \n272.  The August 8 Demand Letter requires a review of policies and programs related to \n24 \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including, on information and belief, faculty hiring, retention, \n25   \n179 Jaweed Kaleem, Here are the details of Trump’s $1.2-billion call to remake UCLA in a \n26 \nconservative image, L.A.

Besides the requirement to provide the disciplinary records of international students, the \n4  August 8 Demand Letter demands that the federal government have access to and the ability to regularly \n5  view a wide variety of records of academic employees, staff employees, faculty, and students, as deemed \n6  necessary by the resolution monitor.183 The only exception is for attorney-client privilege, not for speech, \n7  association, or privacy purposes.184  \n8  274.  On information and belief, the August 8 Demand Letter requires regular reports to the \n9  external monitor regarding all of these measures. \n10  275.  In  making  these  demands,  the  Trump  administration  is  seeking  to  impose  speech \n11  restrictions upon students, faculty, academic employees, and staff employees that would violate the First \n12  Amendment if imposed directly either by the university itself or by the federal government.  \n \n13 \nF.  Defendants Demand that, in Exchange for Federal Funding, the UC Agree to \nMeasures to Limit Lawful Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Efforts. \n14 \n15 \n276.  The August 8 Demand Letter also makes demands aimed at ending UCLA’s lawful \n16 \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including a review of policies and programs related to such efforts \n17 \nin faculty and other staff hiring, retention, and promotion.185 \n18 \n277.  Under the August 8 Demand Letter’s demands, UCLA would eliminate supposed racial \n19 \npreferences and ensure what the federal government deems to be merit-based practices.   \n20 \n278.  Included among those demands are that UCLA must end any race or ethnicity-based \n21 \nscholarships and remove eligibility criteria deemed discriminatory.186 \n22 \n279.  Further, the letter demands the end to the use of any “proxy” for race in the admissions \n23 \nprocess, and calls for a bar on “personal statements, diversity narratives, or an applicant’s [own] \n24 \nreference to racial identity.”187 Although UCLA does not consider standardized test scores in its \n25   \n183 Id. \n26 \n184 Id. \n185 Id. Notably, the University of California does not engage in affirmative action and has not done so \n27 \nin almost 30 years, since the implementation of Proposition 209.  \n28  186 Id. \n187 Id. \n  - 63 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 72 of 123\n \n \n1  admissions process, the document requires disclosure of test scores and other admissions information, \n2  by race and gender, to the administration and the general public.188 \n3  280.  The bar on the use of “proxies” appears modeled after demands made by the Department \n4  of Education’s Office for Civil Rights’ February 14, 2025 “Dear Colleague” letter, which, among other \n5  things, falsely deems numerous lawful means to recruit and admit a diverse student body, and to establish \n6  a diverse and inclusive college community, to be unlawful under Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. \n7  President & Fellows of Harvard College (“SFFA”), 600 U.S. 181 (2023), among other authorities. \n8  Contrary to that view, for example, SFFA specifically contemplates that universities may consider \n9  personal statements wherein an applicant includes a “discussion of how race affected his or her life, be \n10  it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.” 600 U.S. at 230; cf. also Parents Involved in Cmty. \n11  Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 788-89 (2007) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (discussing \n12  “race-conscious measures” to achieve equal educational opportunity “without treating each student in \n13  [a] different fashion solely on the basis of a systematic, individual typing by race”).   \n14  281.  That February 14, 2025 “Dear Colleague” letter has been held unlawful and vacated in \n15  its entirety. See AFT v. Dep’t of Educ., __ F.Supp.3d __, 2025 WL 2374697 (D. Md. Aug. 14, 2025). \n16  Because the Trump administration cannot impose these measures directly, it is attempting to use funding \n17  conditions to coerce the UC to comply. \n18  282.  On information and belief, the August 8 Demand Letter requires regular reports to the \n19  external monitor regarding all of these measures, including how UCLA is working to end supposedly \n20  discriminatory programs and policies. \n21  283.  Notably,  the  August  8  Demand  Letter  does  not  include  measures  to  address  anti-\n22  Semitism. \n \n23 \nG.  Defendants Demand that, in Exchange for Federal Funding, the UC Agree to \nViolate the Rights of Transgender Individuals. \n24 \n284.  The August 8 Demand Letter demands a number of changes in UCLA’s policies as relates \n25 \nto transgender students and other transgender individuals. \n26 \n27 \n28   \n188 Id. \n  - 64 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 73 of 123\n \n \n1  285.  Among the demands are that UCLA make a public statement, and post that statement on \n2  UCLA’s websites, that  UCLA does not recognize transgender people’s gender identities and,  on \n3  information and belief, that it agrees with the administration’s definitions of “male,” “female,” and “sex,” \n4  as set  forth  in  Executive Order 14168. Section 2 of that  executive order  includes the following \n5  definitions:  \n6  (a)  “Sex” shall refer to an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male \n7  or female. “Sex” is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of “gender identity.” \n8  … \n9  (d)  “Female” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large \n10  reproductive cell. \n11  (e)  “Male” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small \n12  reproductive cell.  \n13  286.  Besides making a public statement, the August 8 Demand Letter demands that UCLA \n14  rescind any guidance that allows equal participation by transgender students in UCLA sports and, on \n15  information and belief, that it review and rescind all records, titles, honors, and awards previously \n16  granted to transgender athletes; issue a personal apology letter to any cisgender women who did not \n17  receive such records, titles, honors, and awards as a result of transgender athletics participation; and \n18  refrain from delegating its obligation to comply with Title IX to any outside entity. \n19  287.  Outside the realm of athletic participation, the August 8 Demand Letter demands that \n20  UCLA bar gender inclusive and gender appropriate use of locker rooms, dorm rooms, and restrooms, by \n21  restricting access to such spaces based on individuals’ sex assigned at birth.189 \n22  288.  The terms of the August 8 Demand Letter terms reportedly apply to UC’s medical centers, \n23  and demand that regardless of medical judgment the UC medical centers refrain from providing any \n24  gender affirming medical care, including “hormonal interventions,” to individuals under the age of 18.190 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n \n28  189 Id. \n190 Id. \n  - 65 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 74 of 123\n \n \n1  289.  The August 8 Demand Letter’s demands would require the UC to violate federal anti-\n2  discrimination law as well as California laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual \n3  orientation, or gender identity.   \n4 \nH.  Defendants Threaten to Impose the Same Demands on the Entire UC System. \n5  290.  Beyond the DOJ’s July 29 Notice of Findings to UCLA, Defendants have launched a \n6  barrage of additional purported civil rights investigations against the UC System and various UC \n7  campuses that remain pending.  \n8  291.  On February 3, 2025, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) \n9  opened an investigation under Title VI against UC Berkeley (and four other universities) pursuant to \n10  President Trump’s Executive Order, “Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism.”191 \n11  292.  On March 5, 2025, the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that DOJ \n12  had opened a civil pattern or practice investigation into the UC under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \n13  of 1964, to “assess whether UC has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination based on race, \n14  religion and national origin against its professors, staff and other employees by allowing an Antisemitic \n15  hostile work environment to exist on its campuses.”192 \n16  293.  On March 10, 2025, OCR sent a letter “warn[ing] of potential enforcement actions” to \n17  UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Berkeley, along with 56 other universities that \n18  OCR stated were “under investigation or monitoring in response to complaints filed with OCR” for \n19  alleged Title VI violations.193 \n20  294.  On March 14, 2025, OCR announced it was opening Title VI investigations into UC \n21  Berkeley, along with 44 other universities, pursuant to OCR’s February 14 “Dear Colleague Letter” \n22  requiring all educational institutions to “cease all efforts to circumvent prohibitions on the use of race \n23  by relying on proxies or other indirect means to accomplish such ends” and to “cease all reliance on \n24 \n \n191 U.S. Department of Education Probes Cases of Antisemitism at Five Universities, U.S. Dep’t of \n25 \nEduc.

On June 26, 2025, DOJ notified the UC that it was opening a new Title VII investigation \n7  into the UC System, “including the individual University of California campuses,” to determine whether \n8  the UC’s “UC 2030 Capacity Plan” caused  a pattern or practice of unlawful  race- or sex-based \n9  employment discrimination.196 \n10  296.  On May 9, 2025, the DOJ launched its Title VI investigation of the entire UC System’s \n11  response to antisemitism. On information and belief, the DOJ’s investigation of the remaining UC \n12  campuses other than UCLA “remains ongoing.”197 \n13  297.  On information and belief, while the August 8 Demand Letter is facially directed only at \n14  UCLA, Defendants have informed the UC that the same demands enumerated in the August 8 Demand \n15  Letter to UCLA will be made to the rest of the UC System, except that the amount demanded will be \n16  greater than $1 billion. \n \n17 \nV.

Defendants’ threats and coercive conduct have caused a pervasive sense of fear and \n22  intimidation among UC faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees, who have seen the \n23 \n \n24  194  Dear Colleague Letter from Acting Assistant Secretary Craig Trainor (Feb. 14, 2025),  \nhttps://www.ed.gov/media/document/dear-colleague-letter-sffa-v-harvard-109506.pdf.  \n25 \n195 Office for Civil Rights Initiates Title VI Investigations into Institutions of Higher Education, U.S. \nDep’t of Educ.

Dhillon, Assistant Attorney General, to Michael Drake, President, \nUniversity of California (July 29, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1409416/dl?inline. \n  - 67 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 76 of 123\n \n \n1  UC already begin to alter its policies and practices seemingly in capitulation to the Trump administration. \n2  Defendants’ coercive threats, and the UC’s foreseeable response, have had a widespread chilling effect. \n3  299.  For example, on or about August 6, 2025, the UC announced a new policy expanding \n4  Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (“ICE”) access to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, \n5  Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center, Orthopedic Hospital, and Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at \n6  UCLA, and UCLA West Valley Medical Center. This new policy has caused widespread fear among \n7  Plaintiffs’ members, many of whom are immigrants and fear for themselves and their family members \n8  who work at, study at, or receive health services at UCLA medical centers. \n9  300.  As another example, on September 12, 2025, it was reported that UC Berkeley provided \n10  the Trump administration’s Department of Education the names of 160 faculty members, students, \n11  academic employees, and staff employees who are members of Plaintiffs and whose names have \n12  appeared in reports of “alleged antisemitic incidents.”198 It was reported that UC Berkeley’s usual \n13  procedures for handling complaints had been suspended, and that UC Berkeley’s disclosure of names \n14  was directed by the UC Office of the General Counsel. Some of the individuals whose names were \n15  disclosed to the federal government had never even been informed that a complaint had been filed with \n16  the University against them, nor were they informed of the basis for the alleged charges, let alone \n17  afforded an opportunity to contest the allegations. It was also reported that UC Berkeley did not notify \n18  the affected individuals that their names had been disclosed to the federal government until weeks after \n19  the fact. Those whose names were disclosed to the federal government have been directly harmed by the \n20  disclosure, and the reports of this disclosure have had far-reaching chilling effects through the UC \n21  community. \n22  301.  If the UC accedes to some or all of the Trump administration’s demands, Plaintiffs’ \n23  members will face further injury. \n24  302.  The Trump administration’s demanded restrictions on workers’, students’, faculty, and \n25  others’ demonstrations and expressive activity in certain locations and at certain times, and the demand \n26 \n \n27 \n198 UC Berkeley shares 160 names with Trump administration in ‘McCarthy era’ move, The Guardian \n28  (Sept. 12, 2025), https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/uc-berkeley-trump-\nadministration-antisemitism.  \n  - 68 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 77 of 123\n \n \n1  that protestors not be permitted to protest anonymously, if implemented, would infringe on the First \n2  Amendment rights of Plaintiffs’ members who wish to participate in such expressive activity. \n3  303.  If implemented, the demands to share disciplinary records of international students with \n4  the  federal  government,  to  avoid  recruitment  of  “anti-Western”  or  “anti-American”  international \n5  students, and to “socialize” international students interfere with the expressive rights of Plaintiffs’ \n6  international student members and the rights of other of Plaintiffs’ members to hear the uninhibited views \n7  of those international students, particularly given the absence of any universally accepted definition of \n8  “anti-Western” or “anti-American.” The entirely vague but ominous threat to international students’ \n9  visas and the students’ ability to express dissent from dominant ideologies would also inhibit solidarity \n10  between University employees, their unions, and students from around the world. \n11  304.  The demand to cooperate with law enforcement including immigration authorities, if \n12  implemented, will harm Plaintiffs’ members who face potential harassment and adverse actions from \n13  immigration authorities and will also have a chilling effect on speech and on the ability to receive \n14  necessary health care. Thousands of Plaintiffs’ members are health care providers and/or receive their \n15  health care from UC providers. \n16  305.  The  demands  to  review  all  diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion  policies  and  programs, \n17  including as relate to faculty hiring, retention, and promotion, as well as the process for approving \n18  curricular changes and for academic restructuring across programs, if implemented, would infringe on \n19  academic freedom and harm Plaintiffs’ members who rely on and benefit from such programs and \n20  curriculum. It would also infringe on free speech and free association rights. \n21  306.  If implemented, the demand to eliminate supposed racial preferences and ensure what \n22  Defendants term merit-based practices, including by ending all race or ethnicity-based scholarships and \n23  any supposedly discriminatory eligibility criteria and by ending the use of purported “proxies” for race \n24  in the admissions process including through personal statements, would harm Plaintiffs’ members by \n25  infringing on their free speech rights, reducing the diversity of the UC student body, and preventing the \n26  wholistic assessment of student applicants. \n27  307.  The demand to make and publicize a statement that UCLA does not recognize transgender \n28  people’s gender identities and agrees with the Trump administration’s definitions of “male,” “female,” \n  - 69 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 78 of 123\n \n \n1  and “sex,” and implement that definition by ending gender-inclusive policies as relates to restrooms and \n2  other private spaces and stripping previously awarded athletics honors from transgender athletes, if \n3  implemented, would harm Plaintiffs’ members, including transgender members. \n4  308.  If implemented, the demand that medical centers cease provision of gender-affirming care \n5  to minors would harm Plaintiffs’ members with transgender children who receive medical care through \n6  the University. \n7  309.  The demands to cede authority to a government-appointed external monitor, to give the \n8  federal government access to and the ability to regularly view a wide variety of records of academic \n9  employees, staff employees, faculty, and students as deemed necessary by the monitor, harms all of \n10  Plaintiffs’ members by chilling speech and academic discourse.  \n11  310.  The Trump administration’s demands have already impacted the content of the work the \n12  University is willing to support. For example, in November 2024, UCLA submitted to a private funder \n13  a grant proposal that an interdisciplinary team of UCLA faculty had prepared. The proposal sought \n14  support for a project  concerning academic freedom, including specifically in the context of pro-\n15  Palestinian speech. UCLA selected this proposal following a competitive internal review process, and \n16  senior administrators at the University committed more than $140,000 in University matching funds to \n17  support the initiative that was the subject of the grant. When the private funder later requested that the \n18  team demonstrate the support of senior administrators at the University, however, the University—\n19  having just had $584 million in funding summarily canceled and having received Defendants’ August 8 \n20  Demand Letter—balked. On August 20, 2025, senior UCLA administrators informed the team that they \n21  would  no  longer  be  endorsing  the  project,  despite  the  significant  support  they  had  previously \n22  demonstrated. The private funder informed the faculty members that the lack of senior administrator \n23  support was disqualifying. Despite months of work to prepare a highly competitive grant application, \n24  the faculty members no longer intend to pursue this project because they have no realistic prospect of \n25  obtaining sufficient funding for it, and team members are concerned about their ability to seek support \n26  from the private funder in the future without the support of UCLA.  \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n  - 70 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 79 of 123\n \n \n1  B.  Plaintiffs and Their Members Have Suffered Harm Caused by Defendants. \n2  311.  Plaintiffs’ members have experienced and are continuing to experience significant harms \n3  to their First Amendment rights to free speech and academic freedom because of Defendants’ actions \n4  and credible threats. Defendants’ course of conduct, coupled with UC’s response, has created a climate \n5  of fear that now pervades the teaching, research, and public discourse of Plaintiffs’ members across UC’s \n6  campuses. Plaintiffs’ members’ speech and academic freedom have been chilled in myriad pernicious \n7  ways and will be further chilled and suppressed if UC accedes to the unlawful demands set forth in the \n8  August 8 Demand Letter.  \n9  312.  Plaintiffs’ members have also experienced and are continuing to experience harms to their \n10  financial and professional well-being as a result of Defendants’ unlawful funding cuts and coercive threat \n11  to further withhold still more federal funding from the UC System. Plaintiffs’ members have been \n12  directly and irreparably harmed by the unlawful termination of federal funding for specific projects the \n13  government had previously committed to support. Faculty who are members of AAUP, AFT, UC-AFT, \n14  UAW, UAW Local 4811, CUCFA and its affiliated UC Campus FAs have been forced to immediately \n15  cease ongoing research, which results in a cascade of harms not only to the research itself but also to the \n16  graduate students (many of whom are members of UAW and UAW Local 4811), undergraduate students, \n17  academic employees, and staff employees whose financial and professional fates are directly affected by \n18  this grant funding.  \n19  313.  Members of all Plaintiffs at UC campuses continue to be harmed by the looming threat \n20  of additional funding cuts. Defendants have so far terminated $584 million from UCLA, but the entire \n21  UC receives approximately $5.7 billion in research funding annually, and another approximately $11.3 \n22  billion in Medicaid, Medicare, and student federal financial aid, all of which could potentially be at stake \n23  if the UC does not accede to Defendants’ coercive demands.  \n24  314.  This  complaint  provides  a  few  examples  of  the  extensive  irreparable  harms  that \n25  Defendants’ conduct as alleged herein has caused and will continue to cause Plaintiffs and their members \n26  unless enjoined. \n27  / / / \n \n28 \n  - 71 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 80 of 123\n \n \n(1)  AAUP, AFT, CUCFA, and the UC Campus FAs and Their Members Have \n1 \nBeen and Will Continue to Be Irreparably Harmed.  \n2 \n315.  Because they fear retaliation by the Trump administration, faculty members of Plaintiffs \n3 \nAAUP, AFT, CUCFA, and the UC FAs have engaged in self-censorship with respect to the development \n4 \nof their curricula, conduct of their research and writing, association with faculty and student groups, and \n5 \nconversations with faculty and students, among other contexts.  \n6 \n316.  For example, the curriculum development and public discourse of various members of \n7 \nfaculty unions and associations have been chilled by the Trump administration’s actions. One member \n8 \nof AAUP, AFT, and UCLA FA, for example, is now uncertain whether he will continue to teach an \n9 \narticle addressing an aspect of the Palestinian-American experience in one of his courses. While he \n10 \npreviously offered support to student demonstrations with which he agreed, he now fears lending support \n11 \nto student action regarding Palestine, lest he be photographed, identified, and subject to retribution by \n12 \nthe federal government. \n13 \n317.  A member of Davis FA, CUCFA, AAUP, and AFT who teaches history with a focus on \n14 \nmigration in the Middle East was specifically recruited to UC Davis to develop this curriculum. The \n15 \nfederal investigation into alleged actions of antisemitism has created an environment in which she been \n16 \npublicly called a “terrorist” and threatened with physical violence. Initially, she decided to avoid teaching \n17 \nany undergraduate classes to try to avoid public attention but recently decided not to teach at all for the \n18 \nacademic year 2025-2026 to try to protect herself. As a result, she is unable to advance her scholarship.   \n19 \n318.  Similarly, the administration’s actions against UCLA and other universities, and UCB’s \n20 \nwillingness to turn over names to the federal government on the basis of student complaints, has caused \n21 \na BFA member concern about addressing the topic of climate change in her class. She has historically \n22 \nworked with students to analyze evidence and critically evaluate arguments regarding climate change, \n23 \nand  she  feels  that  doing  so  is  her  responsibility  as  an  instructor  in  her  field.  Because  of  the \n24 \nadministration’s funding cuts to universities and the possibility that even an unsubstantiated complaint \n25 \ncould make her a target of the federal government, she worries that teaching about climate change in a \n26 \nmanner inconsistent with the views of the administration could jeopardize her career, including her \n27 \nability to obtain federal grants in the future.  \n28 \n  - 72 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 81 of 123\n \n \n1  319.  Another AAUP, AFT, and UCLA FA member who is involved in organizing other faculty \n2  members and students intends to engage in collective action over the coming school year in support of \n3  labor and Palestinian rights, as well as students’ free expression rights. His ability to do so has been and \n4  will be affected by any restrictions on campus speech the University imposes as a result of the federal \n5  government’s threats and demands. \n6  320.  One UCLA professor who is a member of UCLA-FA and AAUP and serves in multiple \n7  departments has observed significantly chilled speech on campus. She and colleagues now devote \n8  substantial time to being hypervigilant about their speech, including reframing the narratives surrounding \n9  their work to avoid any descriptions that might result in targeting by the federal government. She reports \n10  that this self-censorship is impacting the areas of research that she and others in her departments focus \n11  on.   \n12  321.  Suspension of grant funding has also subjected the members of AAUP, AFT, UC-AFT, \n13  the UC Campus FAs, and CUCFA to immediate and irreparable harms that will expand dramatically if \n14  additional grant funding is cut in the future.  \n15  322.  As a result of canceled NSF, NIH, Department of Energy, and other grants, AAUP, AFT, \n16  CUCFA, UCLA FA, UAW Local 4811, and UPTE members report having to cease all work on ongoing \n17  research projects, which, in turn, has already meant delayed project timelines; missed gating points for \n18  scientific research, such as institutional review board meetings; clinical trials and  projects halted \n19  midstream, resulting in untreated patients and the lost value of already-expended research effort; and the \n20  potential for lost human capital as talented and meticulously trained researchers and support staff begin \n21  searching for work elsewhere. If these cessations continue, these members expect they or their labs will \n22  be forced to take even more harmful steps, such as euthanizing lab animals or permanently dismissing \n23  staff.  \n24  323.  AAUP, AFT, CUCFA, UCLA and other campus FAs, UAW Local 4811, and UPTE \n25  members report that, in some cases, if the research projects and clinical trials they work on can no longer \n26  access grant funding, they expect they will soon need to abruptly shut down partnerships with study \n27  participants  and  third-party  collaborators  with  whom  these  members  have  spent  years  carefully \n28  cultivating personal and professional relationships. These abrupt shutdowns would not only devastate \n  - 73 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 82 of 123\n \n \n1  the research they are working on today but also make it more difficult for them to structure future work—\n2  because they would have imperiled trust with program participants, who may suffer significant adverse \n3  health impacts as a result of delays and may be reluctant to trust the University going forward, and \n4  tarnished important relationships with service partners, who will be unwilling to invest in future \n5  collaborative work with UC researchers. \n6  324.  UCLA FA members have seen their federal funding cut, forcing them to abandon or \n7  significantly scale back important research projects and layoff or furlough members of their research \n8  teams. Defendants have suspended all federal grant funding to some departments, like the Department \n9  of Integrative Biology and Physiology, and institutes, like the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics \n10  within the Mathematics Department. UCLA FA members have also observed that Defendants appear to \n11  be targeting training grants for cancellation or suspension, and many members have expressed concern \n12  about continued funding for their students and about the future of their fields. \n13  325.  For example, one UCLA FA, AAUP, and AFT member who is a professor affiliated with \n14  multiple departments has had four NSF grants impacted by suspensions and terminations. Two NSF \n15  grants, supporting work with veterans and interdisciplinary research on water management, were \n16  suspended on August 1, 2025. Although these suspensions were enjoined by a federal court order, the \n17  suspensions have nevertheless subjected this professor and her teams to ongoing harm, including \n18  undermining the hard-won trust of veterans, their families, and community partners who support her \n19  project’s work and difficulty advancing the goals of these projects because of uncertainty about funding \n20  and staffing for the projects going forward.  \n21  326.  Another UCLA professor who is a UCLA FA, AAUP, and AFT member has had two \n22  NIH  grants  suspended.  These  grants  supported  research  on  neurological  disorders  and  career \n23  development, and funded equipment, lab supplies, and the salaries of the members of the research team. \n24  On August 1, 2025, the professor was directed to immediately stop spending on these grant accounts. \n25  These grant suspensions have caused this professor and the research team substantial harm, including \n26  interrupting lines of investigation that were several years in the making, requiring a postdoctoral \n27  researcher who no longer has salary support to shift to an entirely different project, and uncertainty that \n28  is precluding this professor from hiring additional staff to support his research.   \n  - 74 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 83 of 123\n \n \n1  327.  A member of UCLA FA, CUCFA, AAUP, and AFT who runs a neuroscience research \n2  lab has had three-quarters of his funding frozen. His research focuses on basic brain functions, such as \n3  memory. This research is crucial to understanding any neuropsychology condition or neurological decay. \n4  Due to the precarity of funding, he is uncertain whether he will be able to retain anyone who works in \n5  the lab including the researchers who have extremely specialized skills and are not easily replaced. Some \n6  in the lab have already been forced to find other work. As a result of the funding freeze, the member \n7  cannot hire someone to take care of the research animals. Every scientist in his lab now rotates taking \n8  care of the animals, leaving less time for research. The remaining lab staff have slowed down the \n9  animals’ rate of breeding because funding is uncertain, which means that future research will be more \n10  limited. This member is also a co-mentor for a post-doctoral student whose NIH grant has been frozen. \n11  As a result of this freeze, the post-doctoral student reports being unsure whether s/he will be able to \n12  pursue a career in scientific research at all. \n13  328.  A member of UCLA FA, CUCFA, AAUP, and AFT and professor saw her federal \n14  funding suspended recently. Her program is funded by an NIH training grant that funds graduate student \n15  genetics research in psychiatric and neurological brain disorders. At least half the students work with \n16  animal and cell models. Funding suspensions have meant sacrificing the animals, leading to an enormous \n17  and unethical waste in resources. One of the students in the program works as part of a lab that has \n18  recently made breakthroughs in research on Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases using genetically \n19  engineered mice—research that is being hindered by Defendants’ actions. Other students are looking to \n20  taking on Teaching Assistant positions to replace funding, taking away time and energy they could be \n21  using to further their important research. The member is concerned about the future of these research \n22  projects, the labs the students work in, and the training program. \n23  329.  NIH recently suspended two grants to a UCLA FA, CUCFA, AAUP, and AFT member \n24  and professor without any explanation. His research focuses primarily on neurodevelopmental and \n25  neurodegenerative disorders such as epilepsy, seizures and autism, etc. His lab develops brain organoids \n26  using stem cells derived from patients with these disorders and uses these organoids to study brain wave \n27  alterations common in these disorders. As a result of Defendants’ actions, he has had to rely on lab funds \n28  generally reserved for repairing and maintaining research equipment. The precarity of the funding led \n  - 75 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 84 of 123\n \n \n1  the postdoctoral researcher in the lab, who authored prior published papers and was working on another \n2  currently under review, to take a position elsewhere. If funding is not restored in the next several months, \n3  the lab will be shut down. \n4  330.  A UCMFA member conducting federally funded public health research on lesbian, gay, \n5  bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual populations was directed by the federal funding \n6  agency to change all language in the project materials referencing transgender individuals. The federal \n7  agency then cut the funding completely, requiring the member to terminate the entire research project. \n8  Defendants did not offer the member an opportunity to appeal the cancellation. \n9  331.  Another UCMFA member’s federal funding for public health research on physicians in \n10  Puerto Rico in the aftermath Hurricane Maria was cut. While this funding was eventually reinstated, the \n11  member was forced to cease data collection during the suspension period, which set the research project \n12  back a whole year. Defendants have suspended and then reinstated research funding for at least two other \n13  UCMFA members, causing significant disruption to their research projects. \n14  332.  A  SDFA  member  conducted  a  federal-grant-funded  training  in  addressing  partner \n15  violence for early career physicians. Defendants cancelled the grant. The stated reason was that the grant \n16  included the word “equity” in the project title. The member has been forced to terminate the training \n17  program, and the twelve early career physicians who were enrolled in it will most likely not receive this \n18  training. Defendants have also delayed grant funding for a project led by the same member that involved \n19  developing youth-led communication materials to address vaccine hesitancy among Hispanic teenagers. \n20  Continued funding disruptions risk harming or destroying community relationships necessary to conduct \n21  this project that the member spent significant time developing. Funding uncertainty due to Defendants’ \n22  actions has also made it difficult for the member to retain staff and pay staff salaries. \n23  333.  Defendants cancelled a SBFA member’s federal funding for public health research into \n24  racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to harmful chemicals. This member’s research project employed \n25  multiple researchers, including two to three undergraduate student researchers. The member anticipates \n26  terminating those undergraduate student researchers due to the funding cancellation. \n27  334.  Defendants have also cancelled research funding for at least two other SBFA members—\n28  one whose research involved developing tools for under-resourced cultural heritage organizations to \n  - 76 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 85 of 123\n \n \n1  digitize their collections and another whose research involved developing computational methods to \n2  identify misinformation and disinformation involving social science theories. Those members were, in \n3  turn, forced to terminate the employment of five graduate students and two undergraduate student \n4  researchers working on those projects. \n5  335.  Defendants have paused grant funding for another SBFA member’s Airforce and NIH \n6  funded research. Defendants also cancelled an SBFA member’s training program for health workers \n7  supporting racially diverse transgender youth and their families, only to reinstate this funding three \n8  months later. During this three-month funding disruption, the member was forced to stop recruitment \n9  and lost multiple potential participants who had initially expressed interest in taking part in the project. \n10  The member was also forced to spend their personal research funds to support graduate students who \n11  would have otherwise been funded by the suspended grant. \n12  336.  The administration’s demand that the UC cease providing medically necessary care for \n13  minor children suffering from gender dysphoria will also irreparably harm Plaintiffs and their members. \n14  At least one member of the AAUP, AFT and UCLA-FA is a professor and faculty member whose \n15  adolescent child has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. As part of the professor’s benefits as a \n16  faculty member and employee of the UC, the UCLA-FA member has had access to gender-affirming \n17  care to treat his child’s gender dysphoria at UCLA Health. Before the child began treatment for her \n18  gender dysphoria, she experienced serious mental health issues that impacted all aspects of her life. Since \n19  receiving care, her life has dramatically improved and she has benefited extensively from that care. \n20  Terminating this medically necessary care at UC would cause immediate and irreparable harm to this \n21  child and her family, and to other families affected by such a policy. This faculty member’s child has \n22  been prescribed medically necessary hormone medication to treat her gender dysphoria. Without access \n23  to this medication and to her clinicians, the child will be at risk of again experiencing the well-known \n24  and serious effects of untreated gender dysphoria. \n25  337.  Should the administration cut additional federal funds to the UCs, the impacts would be \n26  even more wide-ranging and catastrophic. Faculty across the UC system who are members of AAUP, \n27  AFT, the Campus FAs, and CUCFA would see the funding required to complete research and other \n28  essential work evaporate. \n  - 77 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 86 of 123\n \n \n1  338.  For example, one UCLA professor—who is a member of AAUP, AFT, the UCLA FA, \n2  and a representative from the UCLA FA to CUCFA—was recently notified that the funding associated \n3  with a federal grant for foreign language learning, on-campus area studies programs, and overseas \n4  research that supported her work was no longer available. This professor was no longer able to fund a \n5  visiting expert who was to evaluate her students’ work, and if federal grant funding does not continue, \n6  neither she nor her students will have the financial or logistical support necessary to engage in the \n7  overseas field work that is at the heart of her discipline.   \n8  339.  AAUP, AFT, CUCFA, and the individual FAs have themselves suffered harms as a result \n9  of Defendants’ course of conduct. \n10  340.  As part of their core organizational activities, the AAUP and AFT regularly consult, work \n11  with,  and  represent  local  chapters  and  individual  members  regarding  academic  freedom,  faculty \n12  governance, and other issues involving the employment relationship between university employees and \n13  their employers, including but not limited to collective bargaining. Through their local chapters, AAUP \n14  and AFT also provide for the representation of individual members regarding academic freedom, shared \n15  governance, and due process issues in proceedings before their university employers. AAUP and AFT \n16  perform these activities on behalf of members at  UC. Investigations of individual complaints of \n17  institutions violating academic freedom principles in relationship to AAUP members are authorized by \n18  the Executive Director and conducted by a subcommittee appointed by the Executive Director. \n19  341.  The AAUP also specifically maintains a standing committee, known as Committee A on \n20  Academic Freedom and Tenure, which “[p]romotes principles of academic freedom, tenure, and due \n21  process in higher education through the development of policy documents and reports relating to these \n22  subjects and the application of those principles to particular situations that are brought to its attention.”  \n23  342.  As another example, in 2024, the AFT launched a multi-year, million-dollar campaign to \n24  support its higher-education chapters in promoting increased public investment in higher education, \n25  safeguarding free speech and academic freedom on campuses, and establishing meaningful job security \n26  for higher-education workers while ending contingent employment for academic workers. As part of this \n27  campaign, the AFT has hosted a series of organizing webinars, providing its higher education members \n28  with the skills they can use to shape and strengthen their own campaigns to support academic freedom, \n  - 78 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 87 of 123\n \n \n1  make higher education more accessible, and ensure contingent faculty have appropriate job security and \n2  a livable wage. \n3  343.  The AFT also administers the AFT Defense Fund, which provides funding to members \n4  for legal proceedings involving, among other subjects, violations of academic freedom, enforcement of \n5  tenure rights, and other threats to job security. \n6  344.  Defendants’ actions have directly impaired these and other activities of Plaintiffs. \n7  345.  Defendants’ actions have undermined and eroded the longstanding principles of academic \n8  freedom, shared governance, and due process that AAUP and AFT previously helped secure at UC and \n9  other institutions where their members are employed. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, UC and \n10  other universities no longer adhere to these principles. \n11  346.  Defendants’ actions have made it more difficult and resource-intensive for Plaintiffs to \n12  carry out their representation of individual members. Because Defendants have pressured UC and other \n13  universities to abandon their commitment to academic freedom, shared governance, and due process \n14  principles, Plaintiffs must now expend more time and money to ensure that their members’ rights in \n15  these regards are adequately protected. In particular, AFT and AAUP anticipate that they will have to \n16  make significantly more expenditures from their respective Defense Funds to provide for the legal \n17  representation of individual members as a direct result of Defendants’ actions and UC’s potential \n18  capitulation to Defendants’ demands.  \n19  347.  Defendants’ actions have also made it more difficult and resource-intensive for Plaintiffs \n20  to provide accurate and effective guidance to their chapters and members regarding these principles. \n21  Plaintiffs have had to divert staff and financial resources to address the significant influx of inquiries \n22  from chapter leaders and members regarding the effect of such actions on members’ academic freedom, \n23  shared governance, and due process rights, and to ensure that individual members are adequately \n24  represented before their university employers. In addition to responding to such individual requests, staff \n25  for Plaintiffs have had to conduct nationwide calls and virtual meetings with chapter leaders regarding \n26  Defendants’ actions and how to represent individual members in the face of such actions. The AAUP \n27  has sent staff who would otherwise be performing other duties to UCLA to support the UCLA FA. And \n28  AAUP leadership has diverted a great deal of time and resources to supporting faculty across the UCs \n  - 79 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 88 of 123\n \n \n1  who are facing the various challenges posed by Defendants’ threats and funding cuts, and the UC’s \n2  actions in response to those threats and funding cuts. \n3  348.  Defendants’ actions have also caused a pervasive sense of fear and intimidation among \n4  AAUP and AFT’s members. Because of Defendants’ actions and the threats of further cuts to research \n5  and other federal funding, some AAUP/AFT members no longer feel comfortable participating in and \n6  supporting the AAUP’s activities, or asserting their academic freedom, shared governance, and due \n7  process rights. \n8  349.  CUCFA and all the affiliated campus-based FAs have been forced to devote much of their \n9  scarce resources to advocating for their members’ continued federal funding and the opportunity to \n10  continue members’ research in an unrestricted fashion consistent with scientific norms and academic \n11  freedom. This has included helping faculty navigate the obscure internal procedures implicated in \n12  Defendants’ attacks on protected political speech, pressing UC administrators for transparency about the \n13  scope of federal funding reductions, and advising colleagues on ways to recover lost federal resources \n14  and  mitigate  their  impact  on  FA  members’  own  salaries  and  research  and  on  their  postdoctoral \n15  researchers and graduate student workers. This has prevented the CUCFA and FAs from being able to \n16  devote the necessary resources to serving their core mission of advocating with the UC for improvements \n17  to the working conditions of their members. Some FAs also report struggling to recruit and expand their \n18  membership because of a concern by some faculty that joining could cause them or their research to be \n19  targeted. Some FAs have felt compelled to chill their own speech in order to protect their members and \n20  their campus. For example, one FA reports avoiding discussion of Palestine in communications with \n21  members despite interest in the issue among the members and faculty. \n \n22 \n(2)  AFSCME and Its Members Have Been and Will Continue to Be Irreparably \nHarmed.  \n23 \n350.  In  negotiations  with  AFSCME  over  AFSCME  members’  terms  and  conditions  of \n24 \nemployment, the UC has cited federal funding cuts and federal demands for financial penalties as reasons \n25 \nto demand concessions from AFSCME and its members, including staffing cuts. For example, on March \n26 \n19, 2025, the UC announced a systemwide hiring freeze. The UC’s stated reason for the freeze was to \n27 \n28 \n  - 80 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 89 of 123\n \n \n1  prepare for federal cuts to “lifesaving research, patient care, and education support.”199 As a result of \n2  this  freeze,  the  UC  has  not  hired  new  people  into  AFSCME-represented  positions,  diminishing \n3  AFSCME’s membership and burdening AFSCME’s existing members by depriving them of the staffing \n4  they need in their work.   \n5  351.  In June 2025, the UC announced mass layoffs of AFSCME patient care technical worker \n6  members from UCSD Health and UCSF Health, citing a lack of funds. UCSF told AFSCME that layoffs \n7  and involuntary reductions in time were the “result of a loss of federal grant funding.” \n8  352.  On  or  about  August  1,  2025,  the  UC  advised  AFSCME  that  due  to  the  federal \n9  government’s suspension of research funding to UCLA, the UC would be “assessing potential impacts \n10  on University operations, including potential employment impacts,” meaning layoffs and/ or other \n11  takeaways from AFSCME members.   \n12  353.  The collective bargaining agreements between AFSCME and the UC expired by their \n13  own terms on July 21, 2024 and the parties have been in negotiations for more than sixteen months. The \n14  cuts to federal funding and threats of future cuts have contributed to a paralysis in negotiations. This has \n15  required AFSCME’s members to continue to work without a contract and required AFSCME to continue \n16  to spend the majority of its staff time and considerable resources—several tens of thousands of dollars—\n17  on its campaign to insist that the University bargain with the Union in good faith and reach a fair \n18  agreement.       \n19  354.  Defendants’  actions  and  threats  have  also  caused  a  pervasive  sense  of  fear  and \n20  intimidation among many of AFSCME’s members. For example, more than 40 percent of AFSCME’s \n21  members are Latino and a substantial number are immigrants, many of whom are living in acute fear \n22  that they or their family members will be rounded up and detained (or worse) by ICE. These fears arise \n23  in the context of widespread reports that ICE has harassed and/or detained Latino people who are U.S. \n24  citizens or are otherwise authorized to be in the United States, simply on the basis of their perceived race \n25  or ethnicity.   \n26 \n \n199 Michael V. Drake, A message from UC President Michael V. Drake on the University of \n27 \nCalifornia’s financial outlook, UC News (Mar. 19, 2025), \n28  https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/employee-news/president-drake-on-the-university-of-\ncalifornia-financial-outlook/. \n  - 81 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 90 of 123\n \n \n1  355.  On June 24, 2025, ICE agents entered the Emergency Department of Ronald Reagan \n2  UCLA Medical Center where AFSCME members work in a variety of roles such as ER Techs, nurse \n3  assistants, admissions and janitorial services.200 Armed ICE agents wearing military-style clothes with \n4  masks covering their faces remained inside the patient care area of the emergency department for more \n5  than four hours. A van of three to four more agents waited parked outside the main doors where patients \n6  enter and exit. The impact on the workplace and healthcare services was immediate and damaging. Staff \n7  feared for their own safety and the safety of patients and co-workers and impeded in their ability to \n8  perform their jobs providing frontline assistance to emergency room patients.      \n9  356.  The adverse impact did not end when ICE left. Some AFSCME members feared going to \n10  work in the days after. In addition, on information and belief, some AFSCME members and members of \n11  the public were afraid to seek healthcare because of the risk of encountering masked, armed ICE agents \n12  again.201    \n13  357.  On or about August 6, 2025, the UC announced a pending new policy that expands ICE’s \n14  access to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center, Orthopedic \n15  Hospital, and Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA, and UCLA West Valley Medical Center and \n16  limits workers’ ability to enforce their rights and protect the rights of patients. Despite California law \n17  requirements to do so, the revised policy does not require federal agents to produce a warrant or court \n18  order or consistently demonstrate that they have legal custody of a detained patient before they may enter \n19  patient care areas of the facility. Nor does the policy require administrators to insist that ICE officers \n20  identify themselves, remove their masks, or defer to the clinical decisions of health care providers.  \n21  358.  On information and belief, the UC changed this policy as a result of threats to withdraw \n22  federal funding if UCLA did not facilitate cooperation with ICE.   \n23  359.  As a result of Defendants’ threats, some AFSCME members  have been concerned about \n24  going to work or about receiving medical care at UCLA medical facilities. These actions have required \n25 \n \n26 \n200 Clara Harter and Jaweed Kaleem, ICE agents entered UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. It \nwasn’t a raid, officials say., L.A.

AFSCME also has members who identify as transgender. These members work at \n4  multiple UC locations, including at UCLA. AFSCME and its membership have fought for and won \n5  protections for all members from discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and \n6  gender expression, among other categories. AFSCME’s transgender members would be substantially \n7  harmed if in response to the federal demands and threats the UC imposed new restrictions on transgender \n8  employees, such as restrictions on bathroom access or if the UC imposed policies defining “sex” or \n9  “gender”  in  ways  that  deny  transgender  members’  identity.  In  addition  to  working  for  the  UC, \n10  AFSCME’s members and their families are consumers and patients of UC healthcare services. The UC \n11  encourages AFSCME members to participate in UC-affiliated healthcare benefit plans and more than \n12  10,000 of AFSCME’s members have access to UC healthcare as part of their employee benefits. \n13  Eliminating access to necessary medical care at UC medical centers such as access to gender-affirming \n14  care for minors would harm AFSCME members who need or may need such care for their families and \n15  would substantially degrade the quality of their healthcare benefit. On information and belief, AFSCME \n16  has members with minor children who require gender affirming care.  \n \n17 \n(3)  UPTE-CWA  and  Its  Members  Have  Been  and  Will  Continue  to  Be \nIrreparably Harmed.  \n18 \n361.  The UC has cited threats of federal funding cuts and federal demands as reasons to \n19 \ndemand concessions from UPTE and its members, including staffing cuts. UC laid off UPTE members \n20 \nat UCSF Health including workers who held critical roles that directly provided and supported patient \n21 \ncare, such as rehab specialists, clinical laboratory scientists and physical therapists. The UC pointed to \n22 \n“serious financial challenges” as its justification for the layoffs, which was understood to include federal \n23 \nfunding cuts.202 The UC also laid off UPTE members at UC San Diego, including approximately sixteen \n24 \ncareer animal technicians who perform critical work for ongoing research studies aimed at battling \n25 \n26 \n \n27 \n202 Madilynne Medina, ‘Heartless’ mass firings at major Bay Area health care network spark \n28  pushback, SFGATE (July 8, 2025), https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/heartless-firings-bay-area-\nhealth-care-network-20761887.php. \n  - 83 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 92 of 123\n \n \n1  serious diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s. The UC claimed that “mounting financial pressures caused \n2  by federal impacts on health care” was a reason for the layoffs.203  \n3  362.  The collective bargaining agreements between UPTE and the UC expired by their own \n4  terms on September 30, 2024 (for healthcare professionals) and on October 31, 2024 (for technical \n5  employees and research support employees). The parties have been in negotiations for more than a year. \n6  The cuts to federal funding and threats of future cuts have contributed to a paralysis in negotiations, \n7  which has required UPTE’s members to continue to work without a contract and required UPTE to \n8  continue to spend the majority of its staff time and considerable resources—several tens of thousands of \n9  dollars—on its campaign to insist that the University bargain with the Union in good faith and reach a \n10  fair agreement.       \n11  363.  Defendants’  actions  and  threats  have  also  caused  a  pervasive  sense  of  fear  and \n12  intimidation among many of UPTE’s members and have chilled UPTE members in the exercise of their \n13  First Amendment rights. For example, UPTE has many members whose jobs are funded by federal \n14  grants, including members who are personally named in those grants. One such member works under a \n15  federal grant that funds a long-term study on children’s health. In the spring of 2025, several years into \n16  the grant, the federal agency required a reduction in the budget to remove so-called “diversity, equity \n17  and inclusion” components of the project. The federal agency required the project to eliminate one of \n18  the aims of the study that included the word “equity” in the description and required the project to \n19  terminate its association with a trusted community organization that had a word disfavored by the Trump \n20  administration in its name. The organization was one of the grant’s original principal investigators and \n21  provided valuable support for the project, including for the work of the UPTE member specifically. The \n22  threatened cut in grant funding placed the UPTE member at potential risk of layoff. Through a federal \n23  court injunction in the Thakur case, the conditions on federal funding were subsequently lifted, but the \n24  UPTE member remains worried that the funding will be lost if the project were to continue as originally \n25  planned and maintain its association with the community organization.  \n26 \n \n27 \n203 Eric S. Page, UC San Diego Health laying off hundreds of workers, NBC San Diego (June 23, \n28  2025), https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/uc-san-diego-health-laying-off-hundreds-of-\nworkers/3854437/. \n  - 84 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 93 of 123\n \n \n1  364.  The risk of future cuts has led the UPTE member and her colleagues to self-censor in the \n2  hope that by doing so, their project will stay out of the federal agency’s crosshairs. For example, the \n3  UPTE member now avoids talking to the press about the project’s work despite the help that media \n4  coverage could provide the project in recruiting participants and despite public interest in the subject of \n5  the grant. The UPTE member and her colleagues have also removed from their public-facing documents \n6  words or expressions known to be disfavored by the Trump administration (e.g., “equity,” “race,” \n7  “justice,” “diversity,” “transgender”) and citations to anything including those words and are censoring \n8  themselves from using such terms publicly for fear the funding will be cut.  \n9  365.   Another UPTE member is a staff research associate whose career and future as a \n10  scientific researcher has been jeopardized. She has worked in research at UC for more than a decade and \n11  was recently hired for a project that seeks to help diagnose and cure genetic mutations in newborns. \n12  However, the federal government has frozen the project’s funding and the UPTE member does not know \n13  whether she will be able to keep her job and perform this valuable work. Her professional future is \n14  uncertain and for the first time in over a decade, she is having to look outside of UC for work. Her job \n15  search has shown her that the job market is extremely competitive right now because numerous people \n16  are in similar situations to her. Despite her qualifications, she is facing the prospect of not being able to \n17  advance her career as she had hoped and potentially having to leave scientific research altogether. \n18  366.  UPTE also has members who are transgender. These members work at multiple UC \n19  locations, including at UCLA. UPTE and its membership have fought for and won protections for all \n20  members from discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression. \n21  UPTE’s transgender members would be substantially harmed if the UC imposed new restrictions on \n22  transgender employees, such as restrictions on bathroom access or if the UC imposed policies defining \n23  “sex” or “gender” in ways that deny transgender members’ identity.    \n24  367.  In addition to working for the UC, many UPTE’s members and their families are \n25  consumers and patients of UC healthcare services. The UC encourages UPTE members to participate in \n26  UC-affiliated healthcare benefit plans and the vast majority of UPTE’s members have access to UC \n27  healthcare as part of their employee benefits. Restrictions on access to necessary medical care at UC \n28  medical centers such as access to gender-affirming care for minors would harm UPTE members who \n  - 85 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 94 of 123\n \n \n1  need or may need such care for their families and would substantially degrade the quality of their \n2  healthcare benefit. On information and belief, UPTE has members with minor children who require \n3  gender affirming care.  \n \n4 \n(4)  UC-AFT's Members Have Been and Will Continue to Be Irreparably \nHarmed. \n5 \n368.  UC-AFT members’ jobs, privacy, free speech rights, and academic freedom have been \n6 \nand will continue to be harmed. More than 200 UC-AFT represented lecturers and librarians have been \n7 \nlaid off or faced reductions in time and the University has justified these actions as a direct or indirect \n8 \nresult of federal funding cuts. Some layoff notices from the University to UC-AFT members have \n9 \nexpressly cited federal funding cuts as a cause. \n10 \n369.  Defendants’ threats and actions have also generated a pervasive sense of fear and \n11 \nintimidation among UC-AFT members. UC-AFT member lecturers fear teaching material in their field \n12 \nif it touches on subjects perceived to be disfavored by Defendants and have at times declined to teach \n13 \nsuch material because of a concern that Defendants would use the material to further threaten the \n14 \nUniversity with sanctions and funding cuts. This fear is reasonable given the cuts the University \n15 \ncommunity has already seen, especially to grants related to subjects that the Trump administration \n16 \ndisfavors.  \n17 \n370.  For example, a UC-AFT member and lecturer at UCLA reports substantial fears among \n18 \nher colleagues who teach courses in ethnic studies. They have considered whether they need to change \n19 \ntheir course syllabi to avoid cuts to their department or school. \n20 \n371.  Another UC-AFT member and lecturer, on information and belief, removed a unit in his \n21 \nclass because it contained material that offered a critique of a portion of the U.S. economy. The lecturer \n22 \nfeared that teaching the material could cause the lecturer or department to be targeted by the federal \n23 \ngovernment. \n24 \n372.  News that on or about September 4, 2025, UC Berkeley turned over 160 names of \n25 \nstudents, faculty and staff to the federal government in connection with the antisemitism investigation \n26 \nhas exacerbated UC-AFT members’ fears and increased the chilling of the members’ speech and \n27 \nacademic freedom. The 160 names included at least one UC-AFT member. \n28 \n  - 86 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 95 of 123\n \n \n1  373.  UC-AFT members at UC Berkeley report being afraid to attend any protest or rally out \n2  of concern that they will end up on a “list” and have their names and contact information divulged to the \n3  federal government and suffer an as-yet unspecified harm as a result. Some members even report being \n4  fearful about being on campus.   \n5  374.  Defendants’ demand that UC cease providing certain types of healthcare threatens serious \n6  harm to UC-AFT members. UC-AFT members and their families are consumers and patients of UC’s \n7  healthcare services and medical systems. Defendants’ demand that UC eliminate gender affirming care \n8  for minors at UC medical centers would seriously degrade the healthcare benefits UC-AFT members \n9  and their dependents receive and potentially place the health of UC-AFT members’ minor children at \n10  risk. For example, UC-AFT has at least one member whose child received gender affirming care from \n11  UCLA Medical Center as a minor. Had UC medical center categorically refused to provide such care \n12  when this family needed it, this child could have suffered serious ongoing health effects.    \n13  375.  UC-AFT also has members who are transgender themselves. UC-AFT’s transgender \n14  members would be substantially harmed if in response to the federal demands and threats the University \n15  imposed new restrictions on transgender employees, such as if the University imposed policies defining \n16  “sex” or “gender” in ways that deny transgender members’ identity or restricts access to restrooms. \n \n17 \n(5)  AFSCME,  UPTE,  UC-AFT,  UC  Santa  Cruz  Faculty  Association, \nCNA/NNU, UAW, and UAW Local 4811 and Their Members Have Been \n18 \nand Will Continue to Be Irreparably Harmed \n19 \n376.  Plaintiffs AFSCME, UPTE, UC-AFT, UC Santa Cruz Faculty Association, CNA/NNU, \n20 \nUAW, and UAW Local 4811 are labor unions under California with the exclusive legal right to bargain \n21 \nwith the UC on behalf of their members over their terms and conditions of employment. This includes \n22 \nthe right to bargain with the UC over access to the UC’s property to communicate with UC employees \n23 \nthe union represents, distribute literature, investigate workplace conditions, assess contractual and \n24 \nstatutory compliance, and voice the union’s and its members concerns about working conditions. This \n25 \nalso includes the right to bargain over time, place, and manner speech restrictions, and the location of \n26 \nunion protests. These rights are not the University’s to give away. Yet the administration’s demands that \n27 \nthe UC unilaterally impose new restrictions on access and protest activity would deny these unions their \n28 \nrights to negotiate such matters directly with UC.  \n  - 87 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 96 of 123\n \n \n1  377.  Plaintiffs AFSCME Local 3299, UPTE, UC-AFT, UC Santa Cruz Faculty Association, \n2  CNA/NNU, UAW, and UAW Local 4811 would also be irreparably harmed if in response to the federal \n3  demands and threats, the University imposed policies defining “sex” or “gender” in ways that deny \n4  transgender members’ identity and make them unwelcome in the workplace as would the imposition of \n5  new restrictions on transgender employees, such as restrictions on restroom access. These policies are \n6  contrary to these unions’ missions to improve the working conditions of their respective members, and \n7  contrary to contractual language the unions have negotiated to prohibit discrimination based on gender \n8  identity. The unions have spent resources to win protections for transgender members in bargaining \n9  which protections could be eviscerated if the UC gave in to the federal demands and threats. \n10  378.  With respect to CNA/NNU, RNs have a professional duty to provide the highest level of \n11  care to all patients, using evidence-based scientific knowledge. The elimination of diversity, equity, and \n12  inclusion within the UC system will interfere with RNs’ professional duties. Such programs in healthcare \n13  settings are necessary to ensure that racial bias does not interfere with the delivery of appropriate medical \n14  care. Implicit biases have resulted in, e.g., disparate maternal mortality rates along race lines, and \n15  pervasive unscientific beliefs about pain tolerance in non-white patients. These negative health outcomes \n16  can be addressed by education about implicit biases, and prioritizing diversity in medical school \n17  admissions and hiring of healthcare workers. Toward this end, CNA/NNU and UC have negotiated the \n18  formation a joint labor management committee on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The committee is \n19  tasked with carrying out education, training, and other steps toward addressing racial and ethnic \n20  disparities in health outcomes and to promote and improve the delivery of culturally sensitive health \n21  care. If all such programs are eliminated as a result of the Trump administration’s threats, CNA/NNU \n22  will lose this negotiated benefit. CNA/NNU will no longer be able to rely on UC to be a partner in these \n23  programs that are critical to its members’ professional duties, and CNA will need to increase the \n24  resources that it expends on these programs. \n \n25 \n(6)  UAW and UAW 4811’s Members Have Been and Will Continue to Be \nIrreparably Harmed.  \n26 \n379.  Plaintiffs  UAW  and  Local  4811,  as  part  of  being  the  joint  collective  bargaining \n27 \nrepresentatives for 48,000 employees at the University of California, advocate for members’ job security, \n28 \n  - 88 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 97 of 123\n \n \n1  fair wages, academic freedom, and safe working conditions, including protections from bullying, \n2  harassment, and discrimination. In addition, UAW and Local 4811 have a long-standing history at the \n3  UC of supporting the expansion of civil and workers’ rights including non-discrimination protections, \n4  as well as increased federal funding for scientific research, due to its importance for innovation, \n5  economic growth, and public health. \n6  380.  Defendants’ actions have directly impaired these and other central activities of UAW and \n7  Local 4811. UAW and Local 4811 have been forced to spend significant time and resources responding \n8  to the fallout from Defendants’ actions, including counseling members who anticipate loss of jobs or \n9  funding  and  connecting  members  with  outside  resources,  instead  of  doing  the  representational, \n10  organizing, and advocacy work that is its core mission. Notably, UAW and Local 4811 are currently in \n11  the midst of negotiations with the UC for a new collective bargaining agreement covering 36,000 \n12  academic student employees. UAW is also bargaining and preparing to bargain first contracts for two \n13  new bargaining units covering 15,000 professional staff employees at the UC. UAW and Local 4811 \n14  have had to divert their staff and their financial resources from these core activities to address the \n15  significant influx of inquiries from members regarding the effect of the administration’s actions on \n16  research funding, academic freedom, and due process rights. \n17  381.  UAW Local 4811 members have been and will be directly harmed by the current funding \n18  freezes, terminations, and potential additional cuts. Federal grants represent the principal funding source \n19  for UAW Local 4811 members in non-student academic employee positions such as postdoctoral \n20  scholar, researcher, and project scientist. The scientists in these positions rely on outside grant funding \n21  in order to maintain their research and employment at UC, and this funding largely comes from the \n22  federal government. Researchers and project scientists are also often named as a Principal Investigator \n23  on federal grants. The suspension of federal grants on or about July 30, 2025 resulted in immediate \n24  suspension of numerous research projects conducted by UAW Local 4811 members. These employees \n25  have  had  to  redirect  their  time  away  from  critical,  time-sensitive  research  to  instead  search  for \n26  replacement funding. Without replacement funding, these employees risk losing their positions at UC. \n27  Even if replacement funds are located, no other funding can replace the academic prestige that federal \n28  funding grants confer on the recipient scientist.  \n  - 89 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 98 of 123\n \n \n1  382.  Federal grants are also a significant source of funding for UAW Local 4811 members \n2  who are graduate student researchers at UC. A graduate student researcher position is a salaried \n3  employment position that UC graduate students rely on as their source of income to pay rent and living \n4  expenses. Student employees with graduate student researcher positions at a 25 percent appointment or \n5  above also have their tuition reimbursed by UC. The loss of federal grants means that the affected UC \n6  laboratories will lose their ability to hire graduate student researchers, resulting in many UAW 4811 \n7  members losing both their employment, as well as their eligibility for tuition reimbursement. Cutting \n8  federal grants will also interrupt the thesis and dissertation research UAW 4811 members are completing \n9  thus slowing the timeline to degree completion and causing some members to reconsider their projects \n10  or even drop out of their programs. \n11  383.  UAW Local 4811 members employed at UC have also curtailed their public speech out \n12  of fear of having research grants cancelled. This includes some members decreasing their use of social \n13  media to post their views on current political topics, as well as other members deciding not to travel to \n14  and speak at  research conferences they previously attended in order to publicize their work and \n15  collaborate with other scientists. \n16  384.  A UAW Local 4811 member who is an associate project scientist in the Department of \n17  Pediatrics of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA reports that their NIH research grant \n18  funding was suspended on July 30, 2025. The research project involved developing specific T cells to \n19  target solid cancers. The project had four UC employees who drew their salaries from that funding grant \n20  before it was suspended, the member as well as a postdoctoral scholar and two staff research associates. \n21  The suspension has effectively halted new development of the project, including proposed animal model \n22  experiments. Due to other grants the four employees remain employed for now, but if funds remain \n23  frozen there will have to be layoffs, and the supervising Faculty member might depart for another \n24  university, resulting in the whole laboratory where this research project resides being shut down. \n25  385.  Another UAW Local 4811 member who is an Assistant Project Scientist II in the Division \n26  of Cardiology of the School of Medicine at UCLA had his grant funding suspended. The suspended NIH \n27  grant, for which this member was the Principal Investigator, was a K99/R00 MOSAIC award to \n28  investigate wildfire smoke toxicology and effects on atherosclerosis, which is a type of cardiovascular \n  - 90 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 99 of 123\n \n \n1  disease. The grant termination has caused the suspension of the research project and the member’s salary \n2  being reduced by 50%. The member has had to devote his time to finding new funding sources to support \n3  his salary and research. The participation of two undergraduate student research volunteers, who \n4  previously assisted on the project but were not financially supported by it, has ceased, causing them to \n5  lose invaluable experience and training. \n6  386.  A UAW Local 4811 member who is a graduate student researcher in the Division of \n7  Pulmonary and Critical Care of the School of Medicine at UCLA reports that his research supported by \n8  an NIH grant was frozen on or about July 31, 2025. Under the supervision of a Principal Investigator, \n9  his research focuses on sex differences in lung cancer prevention, with an emphasis on metabolism, \n10  epigenetics, and tumor progression, and he previously received assistance from five undergraduate \n11  researchers and one project scientist. The grant freeze has forced the graduate student researcher to pause \n12  in vivo experiments, which are essential to studying sex differences in lung cancer. As a result, the \n13  laboratory’s capacity has been significantly reduced; four of the five undergraduates have left the \n14  laboratory, and the project scientist’s position has been terminated. This has directly stalled progress on \n15  his research project, limited his training opportunities as a graduate student, which could harm his future \n16  career prospects. \n17  (7)  Teamsters Local 2010 and Its Members Have Been and Will Continue to Be \nIrreparably Harmed. \n18 \n387.  The Trump administration’s federal funding cuts have harmed Teamsters Local 2010 and \n19 \nits members, and the administration’s ongoing course of conduct threatens further harm. The University \n20 \nof California instituted a hiring freeze that has reduced the membership of Teamsters Local 2010 and \n21 \noverburdened current members. It has laid off Teamsters Local 2010 members and has threatened \n22 \nadditional layoffs due to losses of federal funding. The University has threatened to lay off a large \n23 \nnumber of Teamsters Local 10-represented positions at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, \n24 \nwhich will damage Teamsters Local 2010’s members and decimate critical research and development in \n25 \nNational defense.  \n26 \n388.  Teamsters  Local  2010  is  scheduled  to  begin  collective  bargaining  negotiations  in \n27 \nSeptember 2025 for its largest bargaining unit comprising over 18,000 employees. The collective \n28 \n  - 91 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 100 of 123\n \n \n1  bargaining negotiations and the ability of Teamsters Local 2010 to win needed cost-of-living increases \n2  for its members will be severely hampered by these funding cuts.  \n3  389.  Due to the Defendants’ statements and actions concerning UC, Teamsters Local 2010 \n4  members have expressed fear in participating in protests or taking collective action or posting on social \n5  media. Teamsters Local 2010 members have engaged in self-censorship in what they wear and say. \n6 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n7 \nCOUNT I \n8  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nViolation of First Amendment Freedom of Speech  \n9  (Unconstitutional Coercion; Retaliation; Content and Viewpoint Discrimination) \n(Against All Defendants) \n10 \n390.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n11 \n391.  The First Amendment secures Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ members’ right to free speech \n12 \nand academic freedom, including the right to pursue research and express different viewpoints and \n13 \npolitical beliefs without retaliation, punishment, or deterrence based on the subject matter of that research \n14 \nor those viewpoints and beliefs.  \n15 \n392.  “[A]cademic freedom ... is of transcendent value to all of us and ... is therefore a special \n16 \nconcern of the First Amendment.” Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, \n17 \n603 (1967); accord Demers v. Austin, 746 F.3d 402, 411 (9th Cir. 2014) (“[T]eaching and academic \n18 \nwriting are at the core of the official duties of teachers and professors. Such teaching and writing are ‘a \n19 \nspecial concern of the First Amendment.’”) (quoting Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603); Meriwether v. Hartop, \n20 \n992 F.3d 492, 505 (6th Cir. 2021) (“[T]he First Amendment protects the free-speech rights of professors \n21 \nwhen they are teaching.”) (citing Sweezy v. State of N.H. by Wyman, 354 U.S. 234, 249-50 (1957) \n22 \n(plurality op.); Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603; Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-81 (1972)).  \n23 \n393.  Students have the First Amendment rights to engage in protest on a public university \n24 \ncampus, including in public fora and limited public fora. See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 267 n.5 \n25 \n(1981) (“[S]tudents enjoy First Amendment rights of speech and association on the campus[.]”). That \n26 \nincludes the right to engage in anonymous protest. See Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. \n27 \n595, 606 (2021) (“[C]ompelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute \n28 \nas effective a restraint on freedom of association as [other] forms of governmental action”); Buckley v. \n  - 92 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 101 of 123\n \n \n1  Am. Const. Law Found., 525 U.S. 182, 199 (1999) (“The injury to speech is heightened for the petition \n2  circulator because the badge requirement compels personal name identification at the precise moment \n3  when the circulator’s interest in anonymity is greatest.”).  \n4  394.  The First Amendment prohibits the government from using threats of legal sanction and \n5  other means of coercion to achieve the suppression of disfavored speech or academic freedom. Nor may \n6  the government coerce a third party to punish, suppress, or control speech on the government’s behalf. \n7  See Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am. v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175, 190 (2024). “[F]or decades it has been clearly \n8  established that the First Amendment tolerates neither laws nor other means of coercion, persuasion or \n9  intimidation ‘that cast a pall of orthodoxy’ over the free exchange of ideas in the classroom.” Dube v. \n10  State Univ. of N.Y., 900 F.2d 587, 598 (2d Cir. 1990) (quoting Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603). \n11  395.  The First Amendment likewise precludes the government from attempting to control \n12  academic thought and discourse on university campuses, and from interfering with a university’s \n13  curriculum or decisions concerning who may teach or areas of research.  \n14  396.  Defendants’ actions alleged herein violate the First Amendment because they constitute \n15  coercion and/or intimidation that is intended to and has the effect of inhibiting the free exchange of ideas \n16  and promoting a government orthodoxy. Defendants’ actions alleged herein have the purpose and effect \n17  of  establishing  a  system  of  both  direct  and  indirect  censorship  and  content-based  viewpoint \n18  discrimination against faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees at the UC. Defendants \n19  undertook such unlawful conduct with the intent to obstruct, chill, deter, and retaliate against Plaintiffs’ \n20  members’ core speech and academic freedom rights. \n21  397.  Defendants’ actions alleged herein further violate the First Amendment by targeting for \n22  retaliation and suppression specific areas or topics of research, scholarship, and other forms of expression \n23  based on content and viewpoint, and by seeking to punish the UC, its faculty, students, academic \n24  employees, and staff employees for engaging in speech disfavored by the federal government. \n25  398.  Defendants’ actions alleged herein further violate the First Amendment by infringing \n26  upon Plaintiffs’ and their members’ right to make expressive choices about what third-party speech to \n27  host and to provide a forum for the pursuit of intellectual and academic inquiry and debate. \n28 \n  - 93 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 102 of 123\n \n \n1  399.  Defendants’ actions alleged herein further violate the First Amendment because they \n2  constitute threats of legal and financial sanctions and conditions on federal funding with the purpose and \n3  effect of infringing on the free speech and academic freedom rights of UC faculty, students, academic \n4  employees, and staff employees, including Plaintiffs’ members. Each of these actions standing alone \n5  constitutes an independent First Amendment violation.  \n6  400.  Defendants have terminated hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, including for \n7  Plaintiffs’ members’ research, without any hearing or process in violation of Title VI and Title IX and \n8  without any other statutory or other legal authority. The First Amendment protects an academic’s ability \n9  to pursue research and scholarship free from arbitrary interference by the government. Independent of \n10  any other action, the unjustified halting of Plaintiffs’ members’ research and scholarship on an unlawful \n11  basis violates the First Amendment.  \n12  401.  Defendants’ concerted efforts to suppress disfavored expression on the UC’s campuses \n13  has already resulted in a sweeping chilling effect on the speech of Plaintiffs’ members as well as other \n14  faculty and students.  \n15  402.  Defendants’  unlawful  and  intentional  actions  are  not  justified  by  a  substantial  or \n16  compelling government interest and are not narrowly tailored to serve any such interest. \n17  403.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n18  See, e.g., Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326-27 (2015). This Court can and \n19  should exercise its equitable power to enter appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n \n20  COUNT II \n21  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions; Separation of Powers \n(Against All Defendants) \n22   \n23  404.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n24  405.  The Constitution vests the legislative power, including the spending power and the \n25  authority to place conditions on federal spending, in Congress. U.S. Const., art. I. Federal legislation \n26  must be passed by both chambers of Congress before it may be presented to the President, and, if signed, \n27  become law. Id.; I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983).  \n28 \n  - 94 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 103 of 123\n \n \n1  406.  The Constitution vests executive power in the President, U.S. Const., art. II, and imposes \n2  on the President a duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, §3.  \n3  407.  The President and Executive Branch have no constitutional power to unilaterally enact, \n4  amend, or repeal parts of duly enacted statutes. Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438–39 \n5  (1998). The declared purpose of separating and dividing the powers of government was to “diffuse[] \n6  power the better to secure liberty.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) \n7  (Jackson, J., concurring); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721–22 (1986) (“Justice Jackson’s \n8  words echo the famous warning of Montesquieu, quoted by James Madison in The Federalist No. 47, \n9  that ‘there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or \n10  body of magistrates’....” The Federalist No. 47, p. 325 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).”). \n11  408.  Congress exercised its Article I legislative and spending authority to authorize the federal \n12  grants and contracts that Defendants have awarded to the UC, including the federal grants and contracts \n13  that Defendants canceled on July 30-August 1.  \n14  409.  Congress also exercised its authority to adopt the carefully defined rules and procedures \n15  set forth in Title VI and Title IX that set forth the procedural requirements for termination of federal \n16  financial assistance. Defendants did not comply with these statutory requirements before summarily \n17  terminating $584 million in federal funding.  \n18  410.  None of the funds received by the UC have a congressionally authorized condition \n19  requiring the UC to comply with any of the demands in the August 8 Demand Letter or subjecting the \n20  UC to review in the manner Defendants have undertaken as alleged herein.  \n21  411.  No Article II constitutional power authorizes Defendants to cancel or withhold duly \n22  authorized federal funding on grounds not authorized by statute.  \n23  412.  No law or statute, including Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX, requires the UC to comply \n24  with the demands in the August 8 Demand Letter. The demands in the August 8 Demand Letter are not \n25  necessary to ensure compliance with Title VI, Title VII, or Title IX, or any other federal civil rights law, \n26  and Defendants lack authority to impose those demands or to take actions to enforce compliance with \n27  them.  \n28 \n  - 95 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 104 of 123\n \n \n1  413.  Neither Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, nor any other statutory provision authorized the \n2  Executive Branch to condition the UC’s restoration of the $584 million in canceled grant funds or to \n3  condition the UC’s further receipt of federal funds on the payment of $1 billion, or on UC’s agreement \n4  to take actions not necessary to achieve compliance with Title VI, Title VII, or Title IX. \n5  414.  No provision of the Constitution authorizes the Executive Branch to enact, amend, or \n6  repeal statutes, including Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX and appropriations approved and signed into \n7  law. \n8  415.  Defendants’ immediate cancellation of federal grants and contracts was not authorized \n9  by statute, overrode the direct Congressional authorization of federal funding, and overrode the express \n10  statutory limitations in Title VI and Title IX that Congress has placed on the cancellation of duly \n11  authorized federal funding. \n12  416.  Defendants’ imposition of additional conditions on the UC’s federal funds beyond those \n13  set forth in Title VI, Title IX, and the authorizing funding statutes was not authorized by statute, overrode \n14  the direct Congressional authorization of federal funding, and overrode the express statutory limits in \n15  Title VI and Title IX that Congress has placed on the termination or refusal to grant of duly authorized \n16  federal funding. \n17  417.  Defendants’ actions as alleged herein are not authorized by any Article II Executive \n18  power but rather are an unconstitutional usurpation of Congress’s spending power, an unconstitutional \n19  effort to amend congressional appropriations by attaching conditions not imposed by Congress, and a \n20  violation of the separation of powers. Defendants’ actions are therefore ultra vires.  \n21  418.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n22  See, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326-27. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter \n23  appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n \n24  COUNT III \n \n25  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nUnconstitutional Conditions / Spending Clause \n26  (Against All Defendants) \n27  419.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n28 \n  - 96 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 105 of 123\n \n \n1  420.  The “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine prohibits the federal government from using \n2  Congress’ spending power “to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be \n3  unconstitutional.” South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210-11 (1987). “Thus, for example, a grant of \n4  federal funds conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or the infliction of cruel and unusual \n5  punishment would be an illegitimate exercise of the Congress’ broad spending power.” Id. \n6  421.  The doctrine also prohibits the government from “requir[ing] a person to give up a \n7  constitutional right … in exchange for a discretionary benefit[.]” Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, \n8  385 (1994). Thus, a funding condition is unconstitutional if it “unconstitutional[ly] burden[s] … First \n9  Amendment rights.” Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214 (2013). \n10  422.  Defendants’ actions as alleged herein have infringed and impermissibly burdened the \n11  First Amendment and other constitutional rights of UC faculty, students, academic employees, and staff \n12  employees, including Plaintiffs’ members, by imposing unconstitutional conditions on the UC’s receipt \n13  of federal funds.  \n14  423.  Defendants’ course of conduct as alleged herein, including its August 8 Demand Letter, \n15  unconstitutionally conditions restoration of the unlawfully terminated $584 million and conditions UC’s \n16  eligibility for all federal funding on UC’s agreement to censor and suppress speech and academic \n17  freedom and engage in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, including but not \n18  limited to through restrictions on protests and expressive activities, sharing information about such \n19  expressive activity by faculty, academic employees, staff employees, and students with Defendants, and \n20  ceding control over certain curriculum and faculty hiring and promotion decisions to an external monitor. \n21  424.  Defendants’  conditions  do  not  just  “define  the  limits  of  the  government  spending \n22  program” by “specify[ing] the activities [the government] wants to subsidize”; rather, they seek to \n23  “leverage funding” to regulate unrelated aspects of campus life, including activities protected by the First \n24  Amendment, “outside the contours” of any discrete federal program. See Agency for Int’l Dev., 570 U.S.  \n25  at 214–15. \n26  425.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ members have been, and are being, harmed by Defendants’ \n27  actual and threatened imposition of unconstitutional conditions on the receipt of federal funding. \n28 \n  - 97 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 106 of 123\n \n \n1  426.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n2  See, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326-27. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter \n3  appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n \n4  COUNT IV \n5  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nViolation of Tenth Amendment / Spending Clause \n6  (Against All Defendants) \n7  427.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n8  428.  The Tenth Amendment provides: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n9  Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” \n10  U.S. Const. amend. X. \n11  429.  As the text of the Tenth Amendment makes clear, the Constitution created a federal \n12  government of limited and enumerated powers. See NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 533-34 (2012) \n13  (opinion of Roberts, C.J.) (“In our federal system, the National Government possesses only limited \n14  powers; the States and the people retain the remainder.”). \n15  430.  No provision of the Constitution delegates to the federal government the power to take \n16  over day-to-day management of a private or state university or to control core aspects of its academic \n17  mission.  \n18  431.  “The Spending Clause of the Federal Constitution … provides Congress broad discretion \n19  to tax and spend for the ‘general Welfare,’ including by funding particular state or private programs or \n20  activities.” Agency for Int’l Dev., 570 U.S. at 213. “That power includes the authority to impose limits \n21  on the use of such funds to ensure they are used in the manner Congress intends.” Id. However, the \n22  federal government cannot use funding limits to circumvent constitutional constraints on the scope of \n23  federal power, such as those imposed by the Tenth Amendment. See id. at 214; NFIB, 567 U.S. at 575-\n24  81 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.). \n25  432.  The anti-commandeering doctrine reflects a “fundamental structural decision” in the \n26  Constitution, “the decision to withhold from Congress the power to issue orders directly to the States.” \n27  Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1475 (2018). The doctrine prohibits the federal government from \n28  commanding states to legislate or regulate on the federal government’s behalf. See New York v. United \n  - 98 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 107 of 123\n \n \n1  States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 925 (1997) (“[T]he Federal \n2  Government may not compel the States to implement, by legislation or executive action, federal \n3  regulatory programs.”).  \n4  433.  Federal  attempts  to  regulate  via  purported  funding  inducements  raise  heightened \n5  constitutional concerns when, as here, the amount of funding at issue is so large as to be coercive, \n6  purported funding conditions are not tied to particular programs directly utilizing those funds, and \n7  program recipients are unfairly surprised by post-acceptance or “retroactive” conditions. See NFIB, 567 \n8  U.S. at 580-81, 584 (explaining that a purported “financial inducement” to participate in a federal \n9  program exceeds the scope of the federal government’s Spending Clause power where it is “so coercive \n10  as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion,’” and concluding that the inducement there \n11  at issue was unconstitutionally coercive because, as a practical matter, it resembled “a gun to the head” \n12  instead of offering “relatively mild encouragement” to adopt and implement a federal regulatory \n13  program). \n14  434.  Federal funding constitutes nearly one-third of the UC’s entire operating budget. Federal \n15  grant funding accounts for 52 percent of all UC research funding sources and is the University’s single \n16  most important source of research funding. Federal student aid programs represent the largest source of \n17  financial aid for UC students. Defendants’ threat to withhold potentially billions more in federal funding \n18  from the UC unless it accedes to the unlawful demands set forth in its August 8 Demand Letter thus \n19  constitutes a proverbial “gun to the head” and crosses the line from mere financial inducement to \n20  impermissible coercion, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  \n21  435.  The August 8 Demand Letter imposes a series of demands that usurp the UC’s regulation \n22  of core state functions and coerce the UC to instead carry out the Trump administration’s federal policies \n23  in these areas, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  \n24  436.  For example, the August 8 Demand Letter commands that the UC adopt policies that \n25  would impinge on the free speech and academic freedom rights of UC faculty, students, academic \n26  employees, and staff employees under the California Constitution.  \n27  437.  The August 8 Demand Letter also commands that the UC adopt policies aimed at ending \n28  UCLA’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including a review of policies and programs related to \n  - 99 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 108 of 123\n \n \n1  such efforts in faculty, hiring, retention, and promotion. Such policies are not required under federal law \n2  and are inconsistent with California policy. See SFFA, 600 U.S. at 230. \n3  438.  The August 8 Demand Letter also commands that the UC adopt a number of policy \n4  changes  that  infringe  on  the  rights  of  transgender  faculty,  students,  academic  employees,  staff \n5  employees, and other individuals interacting with the UC System secured under California law and not \n6  in conflict with federal law, and which policy changes are not necessary to achieve compliance with \n7  Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, or any other federal law. For example, the August 8 Demand Letter demands \n8  that UCLA make a public statement adopting and stating that it agrees with the Trump administration’s \n9  definitions of “male,” “female,” and “sex,” bar gender-inclusive and gender-appropriate use of locker \n10  rooms and restrooms, and refuse to provide gender-affirming medical care to individuals under the age \n11  of 18. These demands require the UC to violate California laws that are not in conflict with federal law, \n12  including but not limited to the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code §51, and Government Code §11135, \n13  which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. \n14  439.  Defendants’ course of conduct as alleged herein has crossed the line from financial \n15  inducement to impermissible coercion, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  \n16  440.  Thus, even if Congress had authorized Defendants’ ongoing attempt to effectively seize \n17  control of the UC, backed up by overt threats to summarily and indiscriminately terminate billions of \n18  dollars in funding en masse, any such coercion contravenes the principle of federalism embodied in the \n19  Tenth Amendment and exceeds the scope of the federal government’s authority under the Spending \n20  Clause. \n21  441.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n22  See, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326-27. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter \n23  appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n \n24  COUNT V \n25  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nViolation of Fifth Amendment (Due Process; Void for Vagueness) \n26  (Against All Defendants) \n27  442.

The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n2  requires due process of law before the deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest. \n3  444.  Plaintiffs’ members have constitutionally protected property interests in funding that \n4  supports their salaries and stipends, as well as in their ongoing research. Plaintiffs’ members have relied \n5  on this funding, and the protections of federal law governing this funding, in pursuing their research, \n6  hiring staff, making commitments to research partners, and in many other ways. Plaintiffs’ members also \n7  have constitutionally protected liberty interests in their freedom of speech and expression, including \n8  academic freedom, and in pursuing their livelihoods. \n9  445.  Defendants’ termination of federal funding as set forth in this Complaint does not provide \n10  the UC or Plaintiffs’ members fair notice or a reasonable opportunity to be heard. \n11  446.  The Due Process Clause also prohibits government actions that fail to give fair notice of \n12  what conduct is forbidden or required. \n13  447.  Defendants’  actions  alleged  herein  establish  unconstitutionally  vague  standards  for \n14  determining whether federal funding will be terminated and do not tie the cancellation of grants and \n15  contracts to specific alleged acts or omissions, much less specific conduct reasonably related to the grants \n16  and contracts at issue. Nor have Defendants provided any adequate notice to Plaintiffs’ members or to \n17  the UC regarding what conduct was forbidden or required to avoid such consequences. \n18  448.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n19  See, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326-27. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter \n20  appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n21  COUNT VI \n \n22  Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A), (C), (D)  \n(Contrary to Title VI; Without Observance of Required Procedure) \n23  (Against Defendants DOJ, Bondi, Terrell, and Funding Agency Defendants) \n24  449.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n25  450.  Defendants’  July  30-August  1  funding  withdrawal  and  August  8  Demand  Letter \n26  constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” under 5 U.S.C. §704 and 42 U.S.C. §2000d-2, \n27  as well as “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court” under 5 U.S.C. \n28  §704, and are therefore subject to judicial review. 5 U.S.C. §§702, 704. The cancellation of grants and \n  - 101 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 110 of 123\n \n \n1  contracts is the ultimate step in the Title VI enforcement process and alters the rights and obligations of \n2  the parties with respect to the terms of those grants and contracts, with legal and concrete consequences \n3  for Columbia, Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs’ members.  \n4  451.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are found to \n5  be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. \n6  §706(2)(A).  \n7  452.  The APA further directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are \n8  without observance of procedure required by law. Id. §706(2)(D). \n9  453.  No lawful grant or contract condition authorized the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal \n10  or August 8 Demand Letter. Nothing in Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, or any other law authorized the \n11  funding withdrawal or the conditioning of federal funds on the payment of money or other terms not \n12  necessary to achieve compliance with those statutes. \n13  454.  Section 602 and applicable, binding regulations with the force of law set forth procedural \n14  requirements that must be followed in order to terminate or refuse to grant federal funding for alleged \n15  noncompliance with Title VI’s substantive requirements. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1; 28 C.F.R. \n16  §§42.106–111 (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §§611.1–13 (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §§80.6–80.11 (HHS); NIH Grants Policy \n17  Statement 4.1.2.1; 10 C.F.R. §§1040.101–131 (DOE). \n18  455.  Because Defendants failed to follow these requirements before terminating funding to the \n19  University on July 30-August 1 and before demanding compliance with the August 8 Demand Letter as \n20  a condition of future funding, Defendants’ actions were contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and \n21  without observance of procedure required by law. \n22  456.  Prior  to  the  July  30-August  1  funding  withdrawal  and  August  8  Demand  Letter, \n23  Defendants did not attempt to achieve voluntary compliance with Title VI or determine that such \n24  voluntary compliance could not be achieved. Nor did Defendants provide an opportunity for a hearing \n25  or make an express finding on the record as to the University’s alleged noncompliance with Title VI. \n26  Nor did any “responsible Department official” determine that the University’s compliance could not be \n27  secured by voluntary means. Moreover, no head of any Federal department or agency filed with any \n28  committees of the House and Senate a “full report of the circumstances and the grounds” for the action \n  - 102 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 111 of 123\n \n \n1  terminating or refusing to grant or continue federal assistance to the University because of a failure to \n2  comply with Title VI. Nor did thirty days elapse after the filing of any such report.

Prior  to  the  July  30-August  1  funding  withdrawal  and  August  8  Demand  Letter, \n6  Defendants did not provide notice of a hearing or conduct any hearing, much less conduct a hearing that \n7  conforms with their own regulations or sections 5–8 of the APA. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. §42.109(a) (DOJ); \n8  45 C.F.R. §611.9(a) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.9(a) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. 10 \n9  C.F.R. §1040.121 (DOE).  \n10  458.  Prior  to  the  July  30-August  1  funding  withdrawal  and  August  8  Demand  Letter,  \n11  Defendants failed to provide the University with a reasonable opportunity to file briefs or other written \n12  statements of its contentions and further failed to issue a decision consistent with the applicable \n13  regulations before terminating funding on March 7. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. §42.110(d) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. \n14  §611.10(d) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.10(d) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. 10 C.F.R. \n15  §1040.121(b) (DOE). \n16  459.  Defendants did not limit the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal or August 8 Demand \n17  Letter to any particular program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Nor was such \n18  withdrawal limited in its effect to any particular program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has \n19  been found. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1; 28 C.F.R. §42.108(c) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §611.8 (NSF); 45 \n20  C.F.R. §80.8(c) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; 10 C.F.R. §1040.114(e) (DOE).  \n21  460.  Defendants’ July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal and August 8 Demand Letter are not \n22  authorized by any law, and no department or agency determined that compliance could not be secured \n23  by voluntary means prior to initiating those actions.  \n24  461.  Plaintiffs and their members are persons who have suffered legal wrong as a result of, \n25  and have been adversely affected or aggrieved by, Defendants’ July 30-August 1 withdrawal of funds \n26  for purposes of 5 U.S.C. §702 and 42 U.S.C. §2000d-2. \n \n27 \n \n28 \n  - 103 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 112 of 123\n \n \nCOUNT VII \n1 \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A), (C), (D)  \n2  (Contrary to Title IX; Without Observance of Required Procedure) \n(Against Defendants DOJ, Bondi, Terrell, and Funding Agency Defendants) \n3 \n462.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n4 \n463.

The cancellation of grants and \n8 \ncontracts is the ultimate step in the Title IX enforcement process and alters the rights and obligations of \n9 \nthe parties with respect to the terms of those grants and contracts, with legal and concrete consequences \n10 \nfor Columbia, Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs’ members.  \n11 \n464.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are found to \n12 \nbe arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. \n13 \n§706(2)(A).  \n14 \n465.  The APA further directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are \n15 \nwithout observance of procedure required by law. Id. §706(2)(D). \n16 \n466.  No  lawful  grant  or  contract  condition  authorized  the  July  30-August  1  funding \n17 \nwithdrawal. Nothing in Title VI, Title VII, Title IX or any other law authorized the funding withdrawal. \n18 \n467.  Section 902 of Title IX and applicable, binding regulations with the force of law set forth \n19 \nprocedural  requirements  that  must  be  followed  in  order  to  terminate federal  funding  for  alleged \n20 \nnoncompliance with Title IX’s substantive requirements. 20 U.S.C. §1682; 28 C.F.R. §54.605 (DOJ) \n21 \n(applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 28 CFR 42.106 through 42.111”); 45 C.F.R. \n22 \n§618.605 (NSF) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 45 CFR part 611”); 45 C.F.R. \n23 \n§86.71 (HHS) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 45 CFR 80.6 through 80.11 and 45 \n24 \nCFR part 81”); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.2 (applying the HHS implementing regulations for \n25 \nTitle IX); 10 C.F.R. §1042.605 (DOE) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 10 CFR \n26 \npart 1040, subparts G and H”). \n27 \n28 \n  - 104 - \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864     Document 1     Filed 09/16/25     Page 113 of 123\n \n \n1  468.  Because Defendants failed to follow these requirements before terminating funding to the \n2  University on July 30-August 1 and before demanding compliance with the August 8 Demand Letter as \n3  a condition of future funding, Defendants’ actions were contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and \n4  without observance of procedure required by law. \n5  469.  Prior  to  the  July  30-August  1  funding  withdrawal  and  August  8  Demand  Letter, \n6  Defendants did not issue to the UC a notice of findings of any alleged violations of Title IX. Defendants \n7  did not attempt to achieve voluntary compliance with Title  IX or determine that such voluntary \n8  compliance could not be achieved. Defendants did not provide an opportunity for a hearing or make an \n9  express finding on the record as to the University’s alleged noncompliance with Title IX. Nor did any \n10  “responsible Department official” determine that the University’s compliance could not be secured by \n11  voluntary means. Moreover, no head of any Federal department or agency filed with any committees of \n12  the House and Senate a “full report of the circumstances and the grounds” for the action terminating or \n13  refusing to grant or continue federal assistance to the University because of a failure to comply with Title \n14  IX.

Agency action is arbitrary or capricious where it is not “reasonable and reasonably \n25 \nexplained.” Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024). This standard requires that agencies provide “a \n26 \nsatisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between the facts found and the \n27 \nchoice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Defendants’ action of immediate cancellation of $584 million in federal grants and \n5  contracts to UCLA was arbitrary and capricious because that decision was not objectively reasonable \n6  and Defendants failed to provide a reasoned explanation for that decision.  \n7  480.  Defendants’ stated reasons for cancellation of federal grants and contracts to UCLA are \n8  not  reasonable,  are  arbitrary  and  capricious,  and  are  not  rationally  related  to  the  breadth  of  the \n9  cancellations, as described in Part IV.C above. Defendants DOJ, NIH, and NSF, and, on information and \n10  belief, DOE, rely solely on complaints of antisemitism that stem from events from late April and early \n11  May 2024 surrounding an encampment on UCLA’s campus, failing to address or acknowledge the \n12  existence of a resolution agreement that dealt with the same events, and without considering or assessing \n13  the adequacy of steps UC and UCLA have taken since May 2024 to address antisemitism. Defendants \n14  NIH and NSF and, on information and belief, DOE also acted arbitrarily by basing the termination of \n15  federal grants and contracts on unsubstantiated and unreasonable findings of unlawful, race-based \n16  admissions practice and sex discrimination.  \n \n17 \nCOUNT IX \n18 \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A), (B): Contrary to Constitution \n19  (First Amendment) \n(Against Defendants DOJ, Bondi, Terrell, and Funding Agency Defendants) \n20 \n481.

the American \n4  Federation  of  Teachers  and  University  Council–American  Federation  of  Teachers;  the  American \n5  Federation  of  State,  County,  and  Municipal  Employees  Local  3299;  the  California  Nurses \n6  Association/National  Nurses  United;  Committee  of  Interns  and  Residents,  Service  Employees \n7  International Union (“CIR”); Teamsters Local 2010; the International Union, United Automobile, \n8  Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (“UAW”) and UAW Local 4811; the \n9  University Professional and Technical Employees–Communication Workers of America (“UPTE”); the \n10  Council  of  UC  Faculty  Associations;  and  the  campus-specific  Faculty  Associations  (“UC  FAs”) \n11  comprised of the Berkeley Faculty Association, Davis Faculty Association, Irvine Faculty Association, \n12  Riverside Faculty Association, San Diego Faculty Association, Santa Cruz Faculty Association, UC \n13  Merced Faculty Association, UC Santa Barbara Faculty Association, UCSF Faculty Association, and \n14  University of California Los Angeles Faculty Association, (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). Plaintiffs bring \n15  this complaint against the President of the United States and multiple federal agencies and their officers, \n16  as outlined below, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin these Defendants from continuing \n17  to use the unlawful threat of federal funding cuts not authorized by law to illegally coerce the UC into \n18  suppressing free speech and academic freedom rights, implementing harmful federal policies on the \n19  Trump administration’s behalf, and otherwise violating the constitutional and state law rights of UC \n20  faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees. Plaintiffs hereby allege as follows:  \n21  INTRODUCTION \n22  1.  In the midst of World War II, as fascism raged throughout Europe, the United States \n23  Supreme Court proclaimed that “[i]f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that \n24  no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other \n25  matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” West Virginia State \n26  Board of Education v. Burnett, 319 U.S. 624 (1943) (Jackson, R.).  \n27 \n28 \n \n  - 1 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 10 of 130\n \n \n1  2.  Unfortunately, today, the Trump administration is seeking to eclipse this fixed star, \n2  through a scheme of targeting, bullying, and unconstitutional actions aimed at institutions of higher \n3  education across the country. Determined to exert ideological control over the nation’s core institutions, \n4  the Trump administration is engaged in tactics that violate the central norms of our democracy, the \n5  United States Constitution, and duly enacted federal laws. In this campaign, it has now set its sights on \n6  one of the nation’s leading institutions—the University of California system—prompting UC faculty, \n7  academic and other staff, and students to band together to file this federal court action challenging the \n8  Trump administration’s violation of the First Amendment and federal law.   \n9  3.  The University of California is an engine of free thought and intellectual inquiry, research \n10  and invention. It is arguably the premiere public university in the world. The breadth and importance of \n11  its contributions to life sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, literature and the arts, medicine, and \n12  technological  advancement  is  well-illustrated  by  its  production  of  74  Nobel  Prize  winners,  101 \n13  MacArthur “Genius” grant award winners, 66 National Medal of Science winners, and 42 Pulitzer Prize \n14  winners. That output is the product of a culture that encourages free speech, values diversity, and \n15  challenges orthodoxy.  \n16  4.  Beyond the academic and scientific output of the University of California, the system is \n17  an engine of economic productivity, providing healthcare to millions of Californians annually and jobs \n18  to hundreds of thousands, while serving as a vehicle for economic mobility and opportunity for its \n19  innumerable first-generation, working and middle class students from California and across the nation. \n20  5.  Yet rather than acknowledging educational institutions like the UC as the assets to this \n21  nation that they are, the Trump administration views them as barriers to the President’s agenda of \n22  ideological dominance. Even before his reelection, President Trump took direct aim at the country’s top \n23  universities, pledging “to reclaim our once great educational institutions from the radical Left and \n24  Marxist maniacs.” This rhetoric from President Trump and his officials has continued and, indeed, \n25  escalated since the beginning of his second term. Once in office, President Trump gained access to tools \n26  of the United States government that his administration is wielding, unlawfully, to seek to stamp out \n27  movements, opinions, and ideas that challenge his worldview. The President’s attempt to require that \n28  universities conform to his worldview is un-American and unconstitutional.    \n  - 2 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 11 of 130\n \n \n1  6.  Defendants’ actions against the University of California follow a Trump administration \n2  playbook that has already succeeded in undermining free speech and academic freedom in the United \n3  States. The playbook echoes one employed by autocratic movements around the world—be it Hungary, \n4  Turkey, or Brazil. Through a series of actions targeting institutions of higher education, the Trump \n5  administration is attempting to coerce colleges and universities across the country to do what the Trump \n6  administration cannot do directly itself: infringe on the speech rights of faculty, academic and other staff, \n7  and students. \n8  7.  The blunt cudgel the Trump administration has repeatedly employed in this attack on the \n9  independence of institutions of higher education has been the abrupt, unilateral, and unlawful termination \n10  of federal research funding on which those institutions and the public interest rely. These terminations \n11  are accompanied by threats to cancel even more (or all) federal funding, unless the targeted colleges and \n12  universities capitulate to the Trump administration’s demands for control of the curriculum, adoption of \n13  the President’s ideological viewpoints, and restrictions on free speech, among other incursions on \n14  faculty, student and employee rights. \n15  8.  As detailed here, on multiple occasions, Defendants have wielded federal civil rights laws \n16  against the UC and other universities as the purported basis for terminating federal funding and grant \n17  awards, while disregarding the statutory constraints that govern the circumstances under which the civil \n18  rights  laws  authorize  the  termination  or  withholding  of  federal  funds.  These  constraints  include \n19  requirements that the federal government provide notice, hearing, and other procedural protections to \n20  recipients  of  federal  funding  and  others  who  rely  on  it,  to  guard  against  this  kind  of  arbitrary, \n21  ideologically driven, and unlawful use of financial coercion.   \n22  9.  Defendants’ economic coercion has succeeded in some cases, allowing it to secure control \n23  over some formerly independent universities. For example, after the Trump administration unilaterally \n24  cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars of federal grants and threatened to cancel even more, Columbia \n25  University acceded to numerous settlement terms that violate the academic freedom and free speech \n26  rights of Columbia’s faculty, staff, and students. Other efforts at coercion, most prominently those \n27  targeted at Harvard University—which went beyond the cancellation of grants and extended to threats \n28  to take over patent rights and prevent international students from attending Harvard or even entering the \n  - 3 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 12 of 130\n \n \n1  country—have encountered resistance and been declared unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful. Thus, \n2  in President & Fellows of Harvard College v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, \n3  the District of Massachusetts found that the administration “used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a \n4  targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities, and did so in a way that \n5  runs afoul of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI.” __ F.Supp.3d __, 2025 WL 2528380, *36 \n6  (D. Mass. Sep. 3, 2025). \n7  10.  The Trump administration is now taking aim at the University of California, which \n8  comprises ten campuses, three national affiliate laboratories, six academic health centers, and numerous \n9  additional institutes, centers, and research laboratories across the State. The administration has made \n10  clear its intention to  commandeer this public university system  and to  purge from its campuses \n11  viewpoints with which the President and his administration disagree. To accomplish this, Defendants \n12  first unlawfully canceled hundreds of millions in research grants to the University systemwide pursuant \n13  to Executive Orders attacking “‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ (DEIA)” programs—\n14  cancellations that have been declared unlawful and enjoined. See Thakur v. Trump, 2025 WL 1734471 \n15  (N.D. Cal. June 23, 2025). Undeterred, Defendants then cut, froze, or terminated $584 million more from \n16  research projects run by the University of California at Los Angeles (“UCLA”) under the guise of a Title \n17  VI investigation into antisemitism allegations. As in the Harvard case, the Trump administration’s \n18  campaign of economic coercion against the University of California threatens the health and safety of \n19  the people of this country. See President & Fellows of Harvard College, 2025 WL 2528380, at *33 \n20  (“Research that has been frozen could save lives, money, or the environment, to name a few.”). The \n21  federal government has further initiated pretextual investigations of other UC campuses and their faculty, \n22  staff, and students, with a looming threat to additional federal funds unless the UC capitulates to the \n23  Trump administration’s attempt to “promote[] a governmental orthodoxy in violation of the First \n24  Amendment.” Id. at *25.  The UC system receives $17 billion annually (one-third of the University’s \n25  entire operating budget) from the federal government for research, student aid, and health care services. \n26  11.  Defendants’ demands, which are outlined in a letter dated August 8 (“August 8 Demand \n27  Letter”), seek to impose this type of “governmental orthodoxy” upon the University of California as \n28  well, by forcing the UC to cede control over curriculum, faculty hiring and promotion, and university \n  - 4 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 13 of 130\n \n \n1  admissions to the federal government and its government-appointed monitor. They further demand the \n2  adoption  of  restrictions  on  protest  and  other  expressive  activity;  agreement  to  disclose  student \n3  disciplinary records; elimination of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” measures to ensure that students, \n4  workers, and faculty of diverse backgrounds can thrive at the University of California; announcement \n5  that the university does not recognize transgender individuals; and an end to gender-inclusive policies \n6  and gender-affirming medical care to minors—among other policy changes that, if adopted, would \n7  violate the constitutional and state law rights of faculty, students, and staff. If granted this control, the \n8  federal government will be re-shaping UC in its own image for years, possibly decades, to come. \n9  12.  The punishments inflicted on UC as part of this campaign of ideological control exceed \n10  what is permitted under the law. In defiance of applicable law, Defendants have unilaterally and without \n11  warning punished the UC by cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in essential research grant \n12  funding, with threats to withhold more, before any finding has been made by any competent tribunal of \n13  wrongdoing, without any hearing, and without providing the UC and other affected stakeholders with \n14  their right under federal law to contest any finding of wrongdoing. On top of their illegally imposed \n15  financial penalties and unlawful policy demands, Defendants are further demanding that the UC pay \n16  more than $1 billion to the federal government, despite no statutory or other lawful basis for imposing \n17  any such fine. \n18  13.  To prevent Defendants from achieving their unlawful objectives through illegitimate \n19  means, a coalition of labor unions and associations that represent faculty, students, academic employees, \n20  and staff employees at the UC have banded together to file this challenge. The plaintiff coalition seeks \n21  declaratory and injunctive relief forbidding the further use of financial threats to coerce the UC to accede \n22  to demands that will harm faculty, academic employees, staff employees, and students, in violation of \n23  the federal Constitution and duly enacted law.   \n24  PARTIES \n25  A.

Public Universities Like the University of California Are Crucial Engines of Free \nThought and Academic Inquiry, Scientific Research, and Economic Mobility. \n20 \n88.  In a democracy, institutions of higher education exist not only as places for research, \n21 \nteaching and learning, but as core civic spaces in which ideas—about science, literature, politics, and \n22 \nsociety—are formed, tested, and debated.  \n23 \n89.  By contrast, autocratic governments consider independent inquiry and thought to be a \n24 \nthreat. In the 1930s, as Nazism was rising in Germany, books from university libraries that were deemed \n25 \nto be in conflict with the National Socialist party and/or books by Jewish authors or with Jewish themes \n26 \nwere removed and burned in town squares. Curriculum was modified. Today, authoritarian governments \n27 \n28 \n  - 16 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 25 of 130\n \n \n1  in Hungary,1 Turkey,2 and Brazil3 have each attempted to place universities under the control of the \n2  central government. \n3  90.  The University of California is a leading academic institution in the United States. Indeed, \n4  it is among the world’s premier institutions of higher learning. The UC System has ten campuses (UC \n5  Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Merced, UC Riverside, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco, \n6  UC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz), three affiliate national laboratories (Lawrence Berkeley \n7  National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory), \n8  six academic health centers systems (UC Davis Health, UC San Diego Health, UCI Health, UCLA \n9  Health, UCR Health, and UCSF Health), and numerous institutes, centers, and research laboratories \n10  across the state. \n11  91.  As alleged in Thakur v. Trump, Case No. 25-cv-04737-RFL (N.D. Cal.), research by \n12  participants in the UC System has contributed to the public interest in immeasurable ways. To name just \n13  a few examples, the UC System’s research laid the groundwork for the internet,4 plug-in hybrid cars,5 \n14  and the world’s largest 3-D map of the universe.6 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n \n21  1 Lydia Gall, Hungary Continues Attacks on Academic Freedom, Human Rights Watch (Sept. 3, 2020), \nhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/03/hungary-continues-attacks-academic-freedom. \n22  2 Muzaffer Kaya, Turkey’s Purge of Critical Academia, Middle East Research and Information Project \n(2018), https://merip.org/2018/12/turkeys-purge-of-critical-academia/. \n23  3 Pedro Salgado, The Crisis of Brazilian Universities: Higher Education Under Bolsonaro, \nInternational Research Group on Authoritarianism and Counter-Strategies (July 22, 2021), \n24  https://irgac.org/articles/the-crisis-of-brazilian-universities-higher-education-under-bolsonaro/. \n4 Pranay Bhattacharyya, UCLA: Birthplace of the Internet, US Tech News (Apr. 28, 2021), \n25 \nhttps://uctechnews.ucop.edu/ucla-birthplace-of-the-internet. \n5 USPath Center, 4 Unexpected Discoveries from UC, UCPath Jobs, https://ucpathjobs.org/lifestyle/4-\n26 \nunexpected-discoveries-uc/ (last visited May 27, 2025). \n6 Lauren Biron, First Results from DESI Make the Most Precise Measurement of Our Expanding \n27 \nUniverse, Berkeley Lab News Center (Apr. 4, 2024),  \n28  https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2024/04/04/desi-first-results-make-most-precise-measurement-of- \nexpanding-universe/. \n  - 17 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 26 of 130\n \n \n1  92.  In the medical field, UC System research has led to development of MRI machines,7 \n2  cochlear  implants  that  restore  hearing,8  a  universal  viral  vaccine,9  a  brain  implant  that  prevents \n3  Parkinson’s symptoms,10 and the use of CRISPR gene-editing to cure sickle cell disease.11  UC cancer \n4  research has contributed to a decline in cancer deaths by one-third over the past three decades, an \n5  equivalent of 3.8 million lives saved.12 \n6  93.  The UC System has produced 74 Nobel Prize winners, 101 MacArthur “Genius” grant \n7  award winners, 66 National Medal of Science winners, and 42 Pulitzer Prize winners.13  Since 2013, the \n8  UC System has topped the National Academy of Inventors’ list of universities worldwide with the most \n9  utility patents.14 \n10  94.  Through continual development of new technologies, UC research has been essential to \n11  the state’s and the nation’s economy, leading to job growth, the founding and expansion of companies \n12  and industries, and significant scientific advancements. Industries that have grown out of UC research \n13  include biotechnology, computing, semiconductors, telecommunications, and agriculture.15 \n14  95.  UC research is making ongoing and rapid contributions to the nation’s economic progress \n15  and knowledge. The UC System averages four new inventions per day.

All of this output comes from the vitality of UC’s academic and social culture, which \n4  encourages and promotes intellectual debate, challenges to orthodoxy, interdisciplinary collaboration, \n5  and diversity in all of its forms. This culture has produced tremendous public goods for decades and has \n6  been expressed in activism and advocacy for causes that were unpopular—and counter to government \n7  positions—in their time: for example, the fight for civil rights, opposition to the Vietnam War, and \n8  challenges to South African apartheid. \n \n9 \nII.  For Decades, the Federal Government Has Funded UC Because UC Produces \nResults: Public Goods of Immeasurable Value. \n10 \n97.  The UC System’s research, like that of other major academic institutions in the United \n11 \nStates, relies heavily on its partnership with the federal government, including on the funding that the \n12 \nfederal government provides for research that is essential to the nation. For decades, this partnership has \n13 \nproduced  groundbreaking  innovations  that  improve  the  health,  safety,  knowledge  base,  and \n14 \ncompetitiveness of the American public. \n15 \n98.  Federal funding is an indispensable source of UC research funding, comprising the \n16 \nmajority of the UC System’s total research awards.18 In fiscal year 2024, the UC System received $4.069 \n17 \nbillion in federal research awards covering 10,256 distinct awards.19 \n18 \n99.  The UC System receives more National  Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and National \n19 \nScience Foundation (“NSF”) funding than any other institution.20  \n20 \n100.  In fiscal year 2024, the UC System received approximately the following amounts in \n21 \nresearch funding, by agency:21 \n22 \na.  $2.54 billion from NIH \n23 \nb.  $525 million from NSF \n24 \n25   \n16 Id. \n26  17 Id. \n18 Id. \n27 \n19 Id. \n20 Id. \n28 \n21 Id. \n  - 19 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 28 of 130\n \n \nc.  $326 million from Defense \n1 \nd.  $160 million from Energy \n2 \ne.  $122 million from other agencies of HHS \n3 \nf.  $104 million from NASA \n4 \ng.  $86 million from USDA \n5 \nh.  $68 million from Commerce \n6 \ni.  $39 million from Interior \n7 \nj.  $27 million from Education \n8 \nk.  $20 million from State \n9 \nl.  $47 million from other agencies \n10 \n101.  These federal funding sources, and the research talent they attract and support, have \n11 \nenabled the UC System to make essential contributions to human progress for decades. Because the \n12 \nnature of research requires years of ongoing work, the UC system has operated research programs across \n13 \npresidential administrations for generations. \n14 \n102.  The innovations the UC System has enabled would be impossible if federal grant funding \n15 \nwere terminated. \n16 \n103.  The faculty members and other research personnel who conduct this research depend on \n17 \nfederal grants. And in turn, their careers—their hiring, tenure, promotion, and retention—depend on \n18 \nfederally supported research. \n19 \n104.  The UC’s dependence on its partnership with the federal government, and its contribution \n20 \nto the nation’s welfare, extends beyond its research function. The UC System is also an important \n21 \nprovider of health care to the population of California. The UC System’s medical centers provide care \n22 \nto millions of Californians annually, including 10.8 million outpatient visits, 1.32 million inpatient days, \n23 \nand 474,000 emergency room visits, at a net community benefit of $2 billion.22   \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n \n28  22 Univ. of Cal., UC and the Federal Government (May 2025), \nhttps://ucop.edu/communications/_files/uc-and-the-federal-government.pdf.  \n  - 20 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 29 of 130\n \n \n1  105.  As such, systemwide, UC Health receives almost $5.3 billion annually from the federal \n2  Medicare program and nearly $4.6 billion annually from the federal portion of the federal-state Medicaid \n3  program, or $9.9 billion in total.23 \n4  106.  The UC System is also a leading engine of economic mobility for its students. One in \n5  every three students who enter college in the bottom 20 percent of income move to the top 20 percent in \n6  income as adults.24 After graduating, UC graduates who entered college from families who are in the \n7  bottom 20 percent of income earn as much as students from middle-income families; and similarly, \n8  graduates who were first-generation college students earn as much as students whose parent graduated \n9  from college by five years after graduation.25 A majority of the UC’s first-generation college students \n10  and federal financial aid grant recipients earn more than their families within four years of graduation.26  \n11  Ninety-three percent of the UC’s lowest-income students go on to earn more than their parents.27 \n12  107.  The UC System’s contribution to economic mobility depends on federal funding. The UC \n13  receives $1.9 billion in student financial aid funding annually, including $494 million in Pell Grants, \n14  over $1 billion in federal student loans, $86 million in graduate fellowships and scholarships, $21 million \n15  in federal work-study, and more than $25 million in other undergraduate grants and scholarships.28 \n16  108.  In total, including research, health care, and student financial aid funding, the UC receives \n17  over $17 billion per year from the federal government. \n18  109.  The UC is also the second largest employer in the state. Nearly 275,000 people work at \n19  the UC campuses and medical centers, and the UC indirectly supports over 500,000 jobs.29  \n20  110.  The UC System contributes in myriad ways to the well-being of Californians in every \n21  county, throughout the state.  \n \n22 \n23 Id. \n23  24 New data shows University of California degrees lead to jobs, economic prosperity, Univ. of Cal. \nOff. of the President (July 14, 2025), https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/new-data-\n24  show-university-california-degrees-lead-jobs-economic-prosperity.  \n25 Univ. of Cal., UC helps level the playing field and promotes economic mobility, particularly for low-\n25  income students, https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/CLIMB-a-\nmobility-analysis.pdf. \n26  26 New Data, supra note 24. \n27 UC and the Federal Government, supra note 22. \n27 \n28 Id. \n28  29 Letter from James B.

Defendants Are Waging a Campaign to Undermine Free Speech and Academic \nFreedom at America’s Universities. \n2 \n \n3  A.  The Trump Administration’s Openly Stated Goal Is to Purge “Left” and \n“Woke” Viewpoints From University Campuses. \n4 \n111.  President  Trump  expressly  campaigned  on  a  promise  “to  reclaim  our  once  great \n5 \neducational institutions from the radical Left and Marxist maniacs.”30  \n6 \n112.  President  Trump’s  2024  campaign  website  included  this  promise  and  numerous \n7 \nstatements describing his intention to curtail academic freedom and control the viewpoints expressed on \n8 \ncampuses. His campaign website pledged, “we will take the billions and billions of dollars that we will \n9 \ncollect by taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments, and we will then \n10 \nuse that money to endow a new institution called the American Academy.”31 \n11 \n113.  The Trump administration is particularly focused on suppressing views that challenge its \n12 \npreferred narrative with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and with respect to race and gender—\n13 \nwhat it refers to as “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or “DEI,” or sometimes “wokeness.” \n14 \n114.  President  Trump’s  campaign  website  highlighted  that  such  viewpoints  would  be \n15 \nprohibited at the American Academy, stating that “there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed—none \n16 \nof that’s going to be allowed.”32 \n17 \n115.  Vice  President  JD  Vance  has  for  years  similarly  expressed  his  intention  to  target \n18 \nuniversities on the basis of disfavored viewpoints. In a speech titled “The Universities are the Enemy” \n19 \ngiven at the National Conservatism Conference on November 2, 2021, he warned that “[t]he professors \n20 \nare the enemy”33 and that “the universities are the enemy,” and urged an “aggressive[] attack [on] the \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \n30 Agenda47: Protecting Students from the Radical Left and Marxist Maniacs Infecting Educational \n24 \nInstitutions, DonaldJTrump.com (July 17, 2023) , https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-\nprotecting-students-from-the-radical-left-and-marxist-maniacs-infecting-educational-institutions, \n25 \nhttps://perma.cc/7HZN-5MW8.  \n31 Agenda47: The American Academy, DonaldJTrump.com (Nov. 1, 2023), \n26 \nhttps://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-the-american-academy, https://perma.cc/B66V-\nZXMT. \n27 \n32 Id. \n28  33 Henry Reichman, “The Professors Are the Enemy,” The Chron. of Higher Educ.

In October  2021, Vance  described the strategy of using  federal  funding to  coerce \n8  viewpoint compliance at universities: “We got a tool here …. We have got to cut off the flow of funding \n9  to the universities that are indoctrinating our children …. If we’re going to spend money on these \n10  universities, they should have to teach things that are consistent with our values and our worldview … \n11  we go to the universities, we use the hundreds of billions of dollars that we send to them as leverage and \n12  we say: ‘Unless you stop indoctrinating our children, unless you stop indoctrinating our entire society, \n13  you don’t get another dime of our money.’”37 \n14  117.  On December 14, 2023, Vance posted to X, “[t]he endowments at Penn, Harvard & MIT \n15  have a combined $95B+ in assets,” and the schools “use these funds to push DEI and woke insanity[.]”38 \n16  And on June 12, 2024, Vance posted on X, “DEI is racism, plain and simple. It’s time to outlaw it \n17  nationwide, starting with the federal government.”39 \n18  118.  Since becoming Vice President, Vance has praised Hungarian President Victor Orbán’s \n19  aggressive strategy to make Hungarian universities better reflect Orbán’s own ideology.40 \n20   \n34 National Conservatism, J.D.

Defendant Leo Terrell, appointed by Trump to head the newly created DOJ “Task Force \n2  to Combat Anti-Semitism” (“DOJ Task Force”), has more recently echoed these same sentiments and \n3  confirmed the Trump administration’s strategy to use the threat of federal funding losses to coerce \n4  universities into adopting the Trump administration’s preferred viewpoints.  \n5  120.  On February 26, 2025, a news article reported Defendant Terrell as saying, “When you \n6  see universities start losing millions of dollars in federal funding, you’re going to see a change in their \n7  behavior.”41 \n8  121.  A few days later, Defendant Terrell stated in a Fox Business clip he later shared on X, \n9  “I’ve targeted ten schools. Columbia, Harvard, Michigan, UCLA, USC. Let me tell you what we’re \n10  going to do. We’re going to take away your funding.”42 \n11  122.  Defendant Terrell starkly described Defendants’ funding coercion strategy on Fox News \n12  on or about March 9, 2025: “We’re taking away their money. We’re gonna bankrupt these universities. \n13  We’re gonna take away every single federal dollar. … The academic system in this country has been \n14  hijacked by the left, has been hijacked by the Marxists. They have controlled the mindset of our young \n15  people … and we have to put an end to it. … If these universities do not play ball, lawyer up, because \n16  the federal government is coming after you.”43 \n17  123.  Other Trump administration officials have expressed similar sentiments. On February 17, \n18  2025, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Edward Martin sent a letter to \n19  Georgetown University Law School asserting that it was “unacceptable” for the private Jesuit university \n20  to “teach and promote” diversity, equity, and inclusion, and seeking to pressure the institution to remove \n21  such content from its “curriculum,” “courses,” and “teaching.”44 On May 23, 2025, Defendant McMahon \n22   \nhttps://europeanconservative.com/articles/dreher/i-would-like-to-see-european-elites-actually-listen-to-\n23  their-people-for-a-change-an-interview-with-j-d-vance/, https://perma.cc/5WJK-KC8P.  \n41 Akiva Van Koningsveld, Head of DOJ Antisemitism Task Force: We’ll Put Hamas Supporters  \n24 \nin Jail ‘for Years,’ Jewish News Syndicate (Feb. 26, 2025), https://www.jns.org/head-of-doj-\nantisemitism-task-force-well-put-hamas-supporters-in-jail-for-years/, https://perma.cc/5327-BU4R. \n25 \n42 Leo Terrell (@TheLeoTerrell), X.com (Feb. 28, 2025, 11:48 AM ET), https://perma.cc/5NBW-\nB6P5. \n26 \n43 Mark McMillan, Leo Terrell with Mark Levin- How we’ll defeat antisemitism in the USA, YouTube \n(Mar. 9, 2025), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFIKRr2Sco, https://perma.cc/5V4R-M692. \n27 \n44 Letter from Edward R.

Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued a series of Executive Orders that laid \n4  the groundwork for his administration’s coordinated attack on academic freedom and free speech and \n5  campaign to control universities. \n6  125.  On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, titled “Ending \n7  Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.”46 Executive Order 14151 proclaims \n8  that  “‘diversity,  equity,  inclusion,  and  accessibility’  (DEIA)”  programs  are  “illegal  and  immoral \n9  discrimination programs.” The Order directs “[e]ach agency, department, or commission head” to \n10  “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all … ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts.”47 \n11  126.  On January 21, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 14173, titled “Ending \n12  Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.”48 Executive Order 14173 states that \n13  “‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI),” and “‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ (DEIA)” \n14  policies are “illegal,” “dangerous,” and “immoral” and can violate federal civil rights laws. The Order \n15  directs federal agencies to take action “[h]olding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for \n16  taking ‘affirmative action’” against DEI and DEIA policies and directs the heads of all agencies to “take \n17  all appropriate action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector the \n18  policy  of  individual initiative, excellence, and hard work,” which the Executive Order asserts is \n19  inconsistent with “DEIA.”49  \n20  127.

On  January  27,  2025,  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (“OMB”)  issued  a \n6  memorandum  requiring  all  agencies  to  “temporarily  pause  all  activities  related  to  obligations  or \n7  disbursement of Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated \n8  by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernment \n9  organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.”51 \n10  130.  On January 29, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14188, titled “Additional \n11  Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism.”52 Executive Order 14188 requires the heads of all executive \n12  agencies or departments to submit reports identifying all civil and criminal authorities or actions within \n13  their jurisdictions “that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and \n14  analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving \n15  institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, \n16  2023, campus anti-Semitism.”53  \n17  131.  Executive Order 14188 explicitly reaffirmed Executive Order 13899, which President \n18  Trump issued during his first term on December 11, 2019. Executive Order 13899 specifically invokes \n19  Title VI enforcement as the means for agencies to combat antisemitism on university campuses.54 \n20  132.  Executive Order 14188 makes no mention of the First Amendment or the need to balance \n21  protection of free speech with the imperative to eradicate illegal discrimination and harassment. \n22 \n23 \n24   \n50 Id. \n25  51 Acting Director Matthew J.

On February 3, 2025, Defendant DOJ announced the creation of the multi-agency DOJ \n2  Task Force, led by Defendant Terrell, to carry out the mandate of the executive order.55 The DOJ Task \n3  Force includes, at minimum, representatives from Defendant DOJ, Defendant ED, and Defendant HHS. \n4  134.  Later that day, Defendant ED announced new Title VI investigations into UC Berkeley, \n5  Columbia, Northwestern University, Portland State University, and the University of Minnesota, Twin \n6  Cities, where ED stated that “widespread antisemitic harassment has been reported.”56 \n7  135.  On or about February 14, 2025, the Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague \n8  Letter requiring all educational institutions to “cease all efforts to circumvent prohibitions on the use of \n9  race by relying on proxies or other indirect means to accomplish such ends” and to “cease all reliance \n10  on third-party contractors, clearinghouses, or aggregators that are being used by institutions in an effort \n11  to circumvent prohibited uses of race.”57 The February 14 Dear Colleague Letter instructed universities \n12  to end all DEI programs within 14 days or risk losing federal funding. \n \n13 \nB.  The Trump Administration Has Been Implementing Its Funding Coercion \nPlaybook at Dozens of Universities and Warning Others They Are Next. \n14 \n136.  Since taking office, the Trump administration has targeted universities where faculty, \n15 \nstudents,  and  academic  and  staff  employees  have  expressed  viewpoints  with  which  the  Trump \n16 \nadministration disagrees, and consistently executed the playbook described by Vance, Terrell, and others \n17 \nto bring public and private universities under the Executive’s control: cite alleged but unproven civil \n18 \nrights violations as a basis for summarily terminating hundreds of millions of dollars of critical research \n19 \ngrants without legal basis, and then threaten to withhold all federal funding from the university unless it \n20 \naccedes to the Trump administration’s demands, which include the payment of money and sweeping \n21 \nreforms that strike at the core of free speech, academic freedom, independent governance, and a host of \n22 \nother faculty, student, and employee rights. \n23 \n \n24 \n55 Off. of Pub.

On March 3, 2025, Defendants HHS, ED, and GSA announced a “comprehensive review \n3  of Columbia’s federal contracts and grants in light of ongoing investigations for potential violations of \n4  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.”58 The announcement referred to “Columbia’s ongoing inaction in the \n5  face of relentless harassment of Jewish students” and declared that, as a result, “Stop Work Orders for \n6  $51.4 million in contracts between Columbia University and the Federal Government” were being \n7  considered. It further stated that the task force would “conduct a comprehensive review of the more than \n8  $5 billion in federal grant commitments to Columbia University to ensure the university is in compliance \n9  with federal regulations, including its civil rights responsibilities.”59 \n10  138.  The following day, on March 4, 2025, President Trump posted on Truth Social, “All \n11  Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests. Agitators \n12  will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students \n13  will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your \n14  attention to this matter.”60  \n15  139.  Just three days later, on March 7, 2025, Defendants DOJ, HHS, ED, and GSA announced \n16  the “immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia \n17  University due to the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish \n18  students.”61 The March 7 announcement stated that these cuts were only “the first round of action” and \n19  threatened that “additional cancellations are expected to follow.” 62 \n20  140.  Immediately thereafter, on March 10, 2025, the Department of Education’s Office of \n21  Civil Rights sent letters to 60 other universities supposedly also “under investigation for antisemitic \n22   \n58 HHS, ED, and GSA announce additional measures to end anti-Semitic harassment on college \n23  campuses, U.S. Gen.

In their press release publicizing these warning letters to 60 universities, Defendants \n5  underscored that they had “announced the immediate cancellation of $400 million in federal grants and \n6  contracts to Columbia University due to the school’s continued inaction to protect Jewish students from \n7  discrimination.”64 The clear import of the press release was to threaten UC and the other universities that \n8  received the letter that they, too, might be subject to “immediate cancelation” of federal grants and \n9  contracts if they did not, in the words of Defendant Terrell, “play ball.”65 \n10  142.  On March 13, 2025, HHS, ED, and GSA sent another letter to Columbia “outlin[ing] \n11  immediate next steps that we regard as a precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia \n12  University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.”66 The letter listed nine \n13  demands, including inter alia that Columbia impose specific forms of discipline (including “expulsion \n14  or multi-year suspension”) on students involved in particular protests, restructure its entire student \n15  disciplinary system in a centralized manner dictated by the federal government, institute a “mask ban,” \n16  place the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department into receivership, and overhaul its \n17  “undergraduate admissions, international recruiting, and graduate admissions practices.”67 \n18  143.

On March 21, 2025, Columbia shared updated policies appearing to give in to nearly all \n4  of Defendants’ demands.69 Among other things, Columbia agreed to expand “intellectual diversity \n5  among  faculty”;  abolish  its  independent  body  responsible  for  discipline  decisions  and  centralize \n6  disciplinary proceedings; hire “special officers” with the “ability to remove individuals from campus \n7  and/or arrest”; and appoint a new Senior Vice Provost to review the Middle East, South Asian, and \n8  African Studies department and “ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced,” \n9  review a new process for hiring faculty in these programs, review the process for “approving curricular \n10  changes,” and make recommendations about “necessary changes” and “academic restructuring” to \n11  “ensure academic excellence and complementarity” in Columbia’s Middle East programs.70 \n12  145.  Nevertheless, the $400 million in terminated funding was not reinstated or restored to \n13  Columbia at that time. Instead, the Trump administration escalated the funding freezes. Defendant NIH \n14  alone  terminated  or  froze  approximately  $1.2  billion  in  funding  to  Columbia,  and  other  federal \n15  agencies—such as Defendant NSF—terminated or froze additional funding.71 \n16  146.  It was not until Columbia on July 23, 2025 agreed to a host of additional, onerous \n17  demands that further infringe on the speech and academic freedom rights of faculty and students—as \n18  well as payment of $200 million to the United States, despite no basis for imposition of any monetary \n19  penalty  under  the  civil  rights  statutes—that  the  Trump  administration  finally  restored  the  grants \n20  terminated by HHS and NIH and resumed “[t]reat[ing] Columbia as eligible for further grants, contracts, \n21  and awards in the ordinary course, without disfavored treatment.”72 \n22   \n68 On Crushing Anti-Semitism on Campus, Hughniverse Podcast (Mar. 19, 2025), \n23  https://hughhewitt.com/leo-terrell-senior-counsel-to-the-attorney-general-for-civil-rights-on-crushing-\nanti-semitism-on-campus, https://perma.cc/6YHF-VZKG. \n24  69 Columbia Off. of the President, Advancing Our Work to Combat Discrimination, Harassment, and \nAntisemitism at Columbia (Mar. 21, 2025),  \n25  https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/03.21.2025%20Columbia%20-\n%20FINAL.pdf. \n26  70 Id. \n71 Sharon Otterman, Columbia Agrees to $200 Million Fine to Settle Fight With Trump, N.Y.

In response to the Trump administration’s coercive demands, and as a condition of \n2  regaining access to federal funds, Columbia entered into a settlement agreement that infringes on faculty \n3  and student First Amendment rights and imposes a series of obligations having nothing to do with Title \n4  VI compliance. Among other things, the agreement requires Columbia to: pay a $200 million fine to the \n5  United States; establish a Resolution Monitor to monitor Columbia’s compliance with the settlement; \n6  maintain the Senior Vice Provost to “conduct a thorough review of the portfolio of programs in regional \n7  areas  across the University, starting immediately with  the Middle East,” “ensure the educational \n8  offerings are comprehensive and balanced,” “[r]eview all and curriculum,” create “new programs to \n9  address the full range of fields,” create a new process for hiring non-tenured faculty across the university, \n10  review the process for “approving curricular changes,” and make recommendations to the President and \n11  Provost about “necessary changes, academic restructuring, or investments that will ensure academic \n12  excellence and complementarity in the given academic areas”; appoint new faculty members with joint \n13  positions in both the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and the departments of economics, political \n14  science, or the School of International and Public Affairs, who must contribute to an “intellectually \n15  diverse academic environment”; and eliminate “programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-\n16  based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or similar efforts,” or that “provide benefits or advantages to \n17  individuals on the basis of protected characteristics in any school, component, division, department, \n18  foundation, association or element within the entire Columbia University system,” and provide a report \n19  to the Resolution Monitor, including “an assurance that Columbia has acted responsibly to ensure its \n20  programs do not promote unlawful DEI goals,” which term is not defined.73  \n21  148.  The agreement further requires Columbia to provide the Resolution Monitor and the \n22  federal  government  with  detailed  admissions  data;  requires  Columbia  to  “maintain  merit-based \n23  admissions policies”; prohibits Columbia from using any “proxy for racial admission … Columbia may \n24  not use personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means \n25  to introduce or justify discrimination;” prohibits the use of “race, color, sex, or national origin as a \n26 \n \n27 \nhttps://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/July%202025%20Announcement/Columbia%\n20University%20Resolution%20Agreement.pdf. \n28 \n73 Id. \n  - 31 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 40 of 130\n \n \n1  factor—implicit or explicit—in hiring decisions across all schools, departments, and programs;” requires \n2  Columbia to “undertake a comprehensive review of its international admissions processes and policies,” \n3  ensure international students are “asked questions designed to elicit their reasons for wishing to study in \n4  the  United  States,”  and  ensure  “all  students,  international  and  domestic,  are  committed  to  the \n5  longstanding traditions of American universities”; and “comply with all requests for immigration \n6  information” relating to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, including “all disciplinary actions \n7  involving student visa-holders resulting in expulsions or suspensions, and arrest records that Columbia \n8  is aware of for criminal activities ... to the extent permitted by FERPA.”74 \n9  149.  The agreement further requires Columbia to impose new protest restrictions and reform \n10  its disciplinary processes so that students will no longer serve on University Judicial Board (UJB) \n11  panels.75 \n12  150.  After the Columbia settlement was announced, on July 25, 2025, Defendant McMahon \n13  posted on X, “The deal with Columbia should serve as a roadmap for institutions across the country,” \n14  and stated on Fox News, “I’m hoping that this negotiation will become a template for other universities \n15  across the country that have these same kinds of practices.”76  \n16  (2)  Brown \n17  151.  The  Trump  administration  has  taken  similar  action  aimed  at  controlling  Brown \n18  University. \n19  152.

On April 3, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration intended to block \n2  $510 million in federal contracts and grants to Brown.78 \n3  154.  On or about April 10, 2025, HHS expanded a Title VI investigation—originally opened \n4  in February 2025 and concerning only the medical school’s May 2024 commencement ceremony—to \n5  include incidents occurring at the entire university from October 7, 2023 to the present.79 \n6  155.  Beginning in April, Brown ceased receiving reimbursements for expenses incurred for \n7  active grants from NIH.80 Those unreimbursed funds totaled over $50 million at the time Brown entered \n8  the agreement described below; that number was increasing by approximately $3.5 million per week at \n9  the time of the agreement.81 The Trump administration additionally terminated eight federal contracts \n10  and more than 30 federal grants to Brown.82 \n11  156.  It was not until Brown capitulated and agreed to a host of demands by the Trump \n12  administration that the administration finally restored the frozen federal funding and terminated grants.83 \n13  157.  As a condition of regaining access to the frozen funds and having its future applications \n14  for federal funding “[f]airly consider[ed] … without disfavored treatment,”84 Brown agreed to pay a $50 \n15  million fine to state workforce development organizations.85 The settlement also requires Brown to adopt \n16  the administration’s definitions of “male,” “female,” and “sex,” as set forth in Executive Orders 14168 \n17 \n \n18  78 Anemona Hartocollis et al., Trump Administration Set to Pause $510 Million for Brown University, \nN.Y.

The settlement agreement directly regulates academic freedom and the content of speech \n7  at the university. Brown must “support ... research and education about Israel, and a robust Program in \n8  Judaic Studies ... renewed partnerships with Israeli academics and national Jewish organizations, and a \n9  convening of alumni, students, and faculty to celebrate 130 years of Jewish life at Brown in the 2025-\n10  2026 academic year.”87 \n11  159.  Other provisions mirror those in the Columbia agreement, including those outlawing \n12  “DEI” initiatives and the use of personal statements as a “proxy” for race in admissions.88 \n13  160.  After the Trump Administration reached an agreement with Brown University, on July \n14  30, 2025, Defendant McMahon posted to X, “The Trump Administration is successfully reversing the \n15  decades-long woke-capture of our nation’s higher education institutions.”89 \n16  161.

The Trump administration has also targeted the University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”). \n20  163.

The Resolution Agreement requires Penn to “restore to female athletes all individual \n9  UPenn Division I swimming records, titles, or similar recognitions which were misappropriated by male \n10  athletes allowed to compete in female categories”; “issue a public statement to the University community \n11  … specifying that UPenn will not allow males to compete in female athletic programs or occupy Penn \n12  Athletics female intimate facilities”; in that public statement, “adopt biology-based definitions for the \n13  words ‘male’ and ‘female’ pursuant to Title IX and consistent with President Trump’s Executive Orders \n14  ‘Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism’ and ‘Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports’”; \n15  “post the statement in a prominent location on its main website and on each of its websites for women’s \n16  athletics”; and “send a personalized letter of apology to each impacted female swimmer.”95 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n \n20 \nResolution Agreement to Resolve its Title IX Violations, U.S. Dep’t of Ed.

The  Trump  administration  has  taken  similar  action  aimed  at  controlling  Harvard \n6  University—but the District Court of Massachusetts has enjoined and declared those efforts unlawful in \n7  violation of the First Amendment, Title VI, and the APA, based on the court’s finding that, among other \n8  things, “Defendants unconstitutionally sought to force Harvard to better manifest the government’s \n9  favored worldview” by “urg[ing] and threaten[ing] Harvard ... to hire faculty and make curricula and \n10  research choices that better aligned with the government’s preferred viewpoints, to the detriment of \n11  professors and researchers with competing views.”97 \n12  168.  On March 31, 2025, the Trump administration announced “a comprehensive review of \n13  federal contracts and grants at Harvard University and its affiliates” as “part of the ongoing efforts of the \n14  Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.”98 The announcement stated that the Task Force would \n15  “review the more than $255.6 million in grants between Harvard University, its affiliates and the Federal \n16  Government” as well as “more than $8.7 billion in multi-year grant commitments to Harvard University \n17  and its affiliates to ensure the university is in compliance with federal regulations, including its civil \n18  rights responsibilities.”99 \n19  169.  The announcement did not point to any specific allegations of antisemitic discrimination, \n20  nor did it request or advise Harvard of any steps to deter or remedy such discrimination. \n21  170.  The announcement further criticized Harvard for “promoting divisive ideologies over free \n22  inquiry,”100 although it did not specify what it meant by “divisive ideologies” or provide any specific \n23  allegations of promoting such ideologies. \n \n24 \n96 Secretary Linda McMahon (@EDSecMcMahon), X.com (July 31, 2025, 12:33 PM ET), \n25  https://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1950957895954149493, https://perma.cc/FJX4-HXG2. \n97 Presidents and Fellows of Harvard Coll., 2025 WL 2528380, at *27. \n26  98 HHS, ED, and GSA Initiate Federal Contract and Grant Review of Harvard  \nUniversity, Dep’t of Health and Hum.

On April 3, 2025, the Task Force sent a letter to Harvard outlining “immediate next steps \n2  that we regard as necessary for Harvard University’s continued financial relationship with the United \n3  States government” and listing nine demands “that the government views as necessary for Harvard to \n4  implement to remain a responsible recipient of federal taxpayer dollars.”101 \n5  172.  The list contained a sweeping range of vaguely defined provisions, only a few of which \n6  had any apparent connection to combating antisemitism, including demands to: \n7  •  review  and  make  “necessary  changes”  to  unspecified  “[p]rograms  and \n8  departments that fuel antisemitic harassment”; \n9  •  make unspecified programmatic changes “to address bias, improve viewpoint \n10  diversity, and end ideological capture”; \n11  •  overhaul  student  discipline,  among  other  things  to  ensure  that  “senior \n12  administrative leaders are responsible for final decisions”; \n13  •  enact a “mask ban”; \n14  •  hold student groups accountable for unspecified “violations of Harvard policy”  \n15  •  undertake sweeping “[g]overnance and leadership reforms” described only as \n16  “meaningful”  and  designed  to  “empower  faculty  and  administrative  leaders  who  are \n17  committed to implementing the changes indicated in this letter”; \n18  •  adopt  “merit-based  admissions  policies”  and  “[m]erit-based  hiring  reform” \n19  without any description of what those polices entail other than an additional demand to “cease \n20  all preferences based on race, color, or national origin”; \n21  •  “shutter” all “DEI programs,” which Defendants allege “teach students, faculty, \n22  staff, and leadership to make snap judgments about each other based on crude race and \n23  identity stereotypes, which fuels division and hatred based on race, color, national origin, and \n24  other protected identity characteristics” without specifying what programs constitute “DEI \n25  programs”; \n26 \n27 \n \n101 Letter from Josh Gruenbaum to Alan M.

On April 11, 2025, the Trump administration sent another letter to Harvard (“the April \n6  11 Letter”). The April 11 Letter listed conditions for “maintain[ing] Harvard’s financial relationship with \n7  the federal government,” including: \n8  •  “‘commission[ing] an external party … to audit the student body, faculty, staff, \n9  and leadership for viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must \n10  be individually viewpoint diverse’; \n11  •  ‘abolish[ing]  all  criteria,  preferences,  and  practices,  whether  mandatory  or \n12  optional, throughout [Harvard’s] admissions and hiring practices, that function as ideological \n13  litmus tests’; for departments, fields, and teaching units found to ‘lack viewpoint diversity’; \n14  •  ‘hiring a critical mass of new faculty’ and ‘admitting a critical mass of students’ \n15  to provide the government's preferred balance of viewpoint diversity;  ‘reform[ing] and \n16  restructuring’ governance; \n17  •  ‘reducing the power held by students and untenured faculty,’ as well as “the power \n18  held by faculty ... more committed to activism than scholarship’; and ‘shutter[ing]’ all DEI \n19  programs ‘through structural and personnel changes.’”102 \n20  174.  On April 14, 2025, Harvard rejected the terms in the April 3 and April 11 Letters.103 \n21  175.  Within hours, the Federal Task Force froze over $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard.104 \n22  176.  Over the course of the following week, President Trump issued a series of social media \n23  posts expressly stating his goal of using federal funding to purge leftist viewpoints from the university. \n24 \n25 \n \n26 \n102 President & Fellows of Harvard College, 2025 WL 2528380, at *4; Letter from Josh Gruenbaum to \nAlan M.

On April 14, President asked, “What if we never pay them? Wouldn’t that be cool?”105 A \n2  senior government official described the Trump administration’s strategy as “mak[ing] examples of elite \n3  schools to intimidate other universities.”106   \n4  178.  The next day, President Trump posted on Truth Social, “Perhaps Harvard should lose its \n5  Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and \n6  terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’”107 “Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, \n7  idiots and ‘birdbrains’ …. Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive \n8  Federal Funds.”108  \n9  179.  On April 16, 2025, President Trump posted on Truth Social: “Everyone knows that \n10  Harvard has ‘lost its way.’ They hired, from New York (Bill D) and Chicago (Lori L), at ridiculously \n11  high salaries/fees, two of the WORST and MOST INCOMPETENT mayors in the history of our \n12  Country, to ‘teach’ municipal management and government. These two Radical Left fools left behind \n13  two cities that will take years to recover from their incompetence and evil. Harvard has been hiring almost \n14  all woke, Radical Left, idiots and “bird- brains” who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students \n15  and so-called “future leaders.” Look just to the recent past at their plagiarizing President, who so greatly \n16  embarrassed Harvard before the United States States [sic] Congress. When it got so bad that they just \n17  couldn’t take it anymore, they moved this grossly inept woman into another position, teaching, rather \n18  than firing her ON THE SPOT. Since then much else has been found out about her, but she remains in \n19  place. Many others, like these Leftist dopes, are teaching at Harvard, and because of that, Harvard can \n20  no longer be considered even a decent place of learning, and should not be considered on any list of the \n21  World’s Great Universities or Colleges. Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no \n22  longer receive Federal Funds. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”109 \n23 \n \n24 \n105 Michael C.

On April 24, 2025, President Trump posted on Truth Social, “Harvard is an Anti-Semitic, \n2  Far Left Institution, as are numerous others …. The place is a Liberal mess, allowing a certain group of \n3  crazed lunatics to enter and exit the classroom and spew fake ANGER AND HATE.”110 \n4  181.  On  May  5,  2025,  Defendant  McMahon  sent  a  letter  to  Harvard  “recit[ing]  the \n5  government’s objection to what it characterized as an imbalance of viewpoints in Harvard’s governance, \n6  reiterat[ing] its earlier demands from the April letters, and stated that ‘[t]he Administration’s priorities \n7  have not changed.’”111 \n8  182.  In early and mid-May, Harvard received letters from various government agencies \n9  terminating grants related to medical, scientific, technological, and other projects.112 \n10  183.  The  termination  letters  did  not  “present[]  any  program-specific  rationale  for  the \n11  terminations.”113 “None of the Termination Letters identified any specific instance of antisemitism on \n12  Harvard’s campus, specified how Harvard failed to respond to any such acts of antisemitism in a way \n13  that violated Title VI, or reflected any effort to follow the Title VI procedural requirements that govern \n14  the termination of federal funding.”114 \n15  184.  On April 11, 2025, the AAUP and AAUP-Harvard Faculty Chapter filed a complaint \n16  against the Trump administration (later joined by UAW, Harvard Graduate Students Union, and Harvard \n17  Academic Workers) seeking to enjoin the Trump administration’s unlawful and coercive conduct and \n18  grant terminations.115 The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the First Amendment by \n19  retaliating based on the exercise of First Amendment rights, imposing content- and viewpoint-based \n20  burdens on those rights, and unconstitutionally coercing Harvard to suppress free speech and academic \n21  freedom, and that the defendants violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to comply \n22  with the statute’s required procedures prior to terminating the grants, and that the grant terminations \n23  were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”).  \n24 \n \n25  110 Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Truth Social (Apr. 24, 2025, 6:33 AM) \nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114393194962253226.  \n26  111 President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 2025 WL 2528380, at *6. \n112 Id. at *7. \n27 \n113 Id. \n114 Id. at *8. \n28 \n115 Id. at *1, *10. \n  - 40 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 49 of 130\n \n \n1  185.  On  April  21,  2025,  the  President  and  Fellows  of  Harvard  College  \n2  filed its own suit against the Trump administration, asserting claims similar to those asserted in the AAUP \n3  complaint as well as an unconstitutional conditions claim, and seeking to vacate and set aside the various \n4  termination letters and freeze orders. The two actions were consolidated and proceeded directly to \n5  summary judgment, with all parties agreeing to expedited briefing.116  \n6  186.  On May 28, 2025, President Trump expressed his intent to retaliate against Harvard for \n7  refusing to accede to the administration’s demands and instead filing suit, stating “every time [Harvard] \n8  fight[s], they lose another $250 million.”117 \n9  187.  On  September  3,  2025,  the  district  court  issued  a  decision  vacating  the  various \n10  termination letters and freeze orders as violating the First Amendment, Title VI and the APA. The court \n11  enjoined “any other termination, fund freezes, stop work orders, or otherwise withholding payment on \n12  existing grants or other federal funding, or refusing to award future grants, contracts, or other federal \n13  funding to Harvard in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on any purported \n14  grounds of discrimination without compliance with the terms of Title VI.”118  \n15  188.  The court’s factual findings were based primarily on the administrative record filed in the \n16  case.119 The court found that, through its demands in the April 11, 2025 letter, the federal government \n17  impermissibly sought to impose ideological control over Harvard: “In brief, the April 11 Letter purported \n18  to require Harvard to overhaul its governance, hiring, and academic programs to comport with the \n19  government’s ideology and prescribed viewpoint.”120 The court further found that the April 11 letter \n20  conditioned the grants on Harvard “acceding to the government’s demands” for ideological control.121  \n21  189.  This attempted ideological control included “whether Harvard was ‘vetting students who \n22  are coming in from outside of the country to make sure they’re not activists’ and ‘vetting professors that \n23  [it is] hiring to make sure that they’re not teaching ideologies.’”122 The court pointed out that the \n24   \n116 Id. at *10. \n25  117 Id. at *9. \n118 Id. at *38. \n26 \n119 Id. at *1 n.2. \n120 Id. at *23. \n27 \n121 Id. at *24; see also id. at *27 (defendants “condition[ed] Harvard’s federal funding … on Harvard’s \n28  realigning its campus to better reflect a viewpoint favored by the government”). \n122 Id. at *25 n.22. \n  - 41 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 50 of 130\n \n \n1  government “specifically conditioned funding on agreeing to its ten terms, ... six related to ideological \n2  and pedagogical concerns, including who may lead and teach at Harvard, who may be admitted, and \n3  what may be taught.”123 \n4  190.  Similarly,  the  court  concluded  that  “Defendants  unconstitutionally  sought  to  force \n5  Harvard to better manifest the government’s favored worldview … To do so, Defendants … urged and \n6  threatened Harvard … to hire faculty and make curricula and research choices that better aligned with \n7  the government’s preferred viewpoints, to the detriment of professors and researchers with competing \n8  views.”124 Thus, “Defendants required the [AAUP and UAW] members to rebalance and alter their \n9  speech to save Harvard’s funding.”125 \n10  191.   The court further “found that the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters resulted from \n11  Harvard’s exercise of its First Amendment rights,” noting that “the conditions here are particularly \n12  concerning because, as discussed, many of them were based on Harvard’s ‘particular beliefs,’ Nat’l Rifle \n13  Ass’n of Am. v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175, 188 (2024), and sought to dictate the content of speech on campus \n14  and the ‘particular views taken by speakers on [particular] subject[s],’ Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors \n15  of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995).”126 \n16  192.  The court also rejected the federal government’s argument that its actions were based on \n17  fighting antisemitism: “The idea that fighting antisemitism is Defendants’ true aim is belied by the fact \n18  that the majority of the demands they are making of Harvard to restore its research funding are directed, \n19  on their face, at Harvard's governance, staffing and hiring practices, and admissions policies—all of \n20  which have little to do with antisemitism and everything to do with Defendants’ power and political \n21  views.”127 The court pointed out that the government “specifically conditioned funding on agreeing to \n22  its ten terms, only one of which related to antisemitism, while six related to ideological and pedagogical \n23  concerns.”128 At base, “the government-initiated onslaught against Harvard was much more about \n24 \n25   \n123 Id. at *24. \n26 \n124 Id. at *27. \n125 Id. \n27 \n126 Id. at *26. \n28  127 Id. at *37. \n128 Id. at *24. \n  - 42 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 51 of 130\n \n \n1  promoting a governmental orthodoxy in violation of the First Amendment than about anything else, \n2  including fighting antisemitism.”129 \n3  193.  The court concluded that “what lies at the core of this dispute is the fact that Defendants \n4  are trying to pressure Harvard to accede to the government's demands in a way that squarely violates \n5  Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and ignores the procedural requirements of Title VI and, to a certain \n6  extent, the APA.”130 The court found there was “little connection between the research affected by the \n7  grant terminations and antisemitism,” and that “a review of the administrative record makes it difficult \n8  to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, \n9  ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities, and did so in a way that runs afoul \n10  of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI.”131 \n \n11 \nIV.

On May 9, 2025, DOJ, through the Educational Opportunities Section of the Civil Rights \n14 \nDivision, notified the UC that it had opened an investigation “into the University of California System’s \n15 \n(UC  or  UC  System)  response  to  incidents  of  antisemitic  discrimination,  harassment,  abuse,  and \n16 \nretaliation against students that occurred within the educational environment of the UC System.”132  \n17 \n195.

On July 29, 2025, DOJ issued a  “Notice of Findings Regarding the University of \n2  California, Los Angeles” (“Notice of Findings”), in which DOJ stated, “[W]e have found that UCLA’s \n3  response to its students’ complaints of antisemitism on UCLA’s campus violated its obligations under \n4  the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n5  42 U.S.C. §2000d (Title VI).”134 The Notice of Findings’ conclusion related specifically to “UCLA’s \n6  response to the protest encampment on its campus in the spring of 2024,” and the Notice did not discuss \n7  any allegations of harassment or discrimination outside the time period of April 25 to May 1, 2024.135  \n8  197.  The Notice of Findings stated that “[t]he Department’s investigation of the greater UC \n9  System remains ongoing,” and that “[t]he Department has not yet reached a conclusion regarding \n10  whether any other UC System school has violated the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI, as those \n11  investigations are still ongoing.”136 The Notice of Findings also asserted that the investigation into \n12  allegations of discrimination against Jewish and Israeli students that resulted in the Notice “is separate \n13  and distinct from [DOJ’s] investigations relating to the University of California’s admissions practices \n14  and allegations of employment discrimination.”137  \n15  198.

On  July  30,  2025,  NSF  sent  UCLA  a  letter  with  the  subject  “Notice  of  Award \n18  Suspensions,” identifying approximately 300 awards worth a combined total of approximately $170 \n19  million, with $90 million remaining unspent, and stating that, “Effective immediately, the attached \n20  awards are suspended until further notice.”138 The July 30 NSF letter stated that it reflects “the final \n21  agency decision and [is] not subject to appeal” and that the decision was made “on the basis that the \n22  awards no longer effectuate program goals or agency priorities.”139 \n23 \n \n24  134 Id. at 1.  \n135 Id. at 3-6.  \n25  136 Id. at 1.  \n137 Id.  \n26 \n138 Thakur, Dkt. 79-1; Molly Shan, NSF Grant Suspensions at UCLA total $90M lost in value, Grant \nWitness (Aug. 1, 2025), https://grant-witness.us/posts/UCLA-new-terminations/; Mikhail Zinshteyn, \n27 \nUCLA research grants suspended after Trump administration faulted campus for antisemitism, Cal \nMatters (Jul. 31, 2025), https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/07/ucla/. \n28 \n139 Thakur, Dkt. 79-1.  \n  - 44 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 53 of 130\n \n \n1  200.  On August 1, 2025, NSF sent an “Updated Notice of Award Suspensions” to UCLA, \n2  which “officially notified [UCLA] that the [NSF] is hereby suspending the attached list of grant awards \n3  to the [UCLA],” and directed UCLA to “immediately cease all activities on these award numbers.” The \n4  stated basis for the indefinite suspension was purportedly “to address concerns reported and observed in \n5  UCLA programs and ensure compliance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations, and the terms \n6  and conditions of the[] Federal awards.” The Updated Notice stated that it was effective July 30, 2025.  \n7  201.  The August 1 letter stated that, “[b]ased on UCLA’s failure to comply with federal \n8  requirements, policies and procedures, NSF is suspending the attached award[,]” and that “NSF has \n9  identified the following specific examples of noncompliance: [(1)] UCLA engages in racism, in the form \n10  of illegal race-based preferences in admissions practices; [(2)] UCLA fails to promote a research \n11  environment free of antisemitism and bias; [(3)] UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by \n12  allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.”140   \n13  202.  In particular, the letter stated NSF’s “belie[f] that UCLA’s ‘holistic review’ admissions \n14  process, which considers factors such as an applicant’s neighborhood/zip code, family income, and \n15  school profile—and invites the disclosure of an applicant’s race via personal statements—is a transparent \n16  attempt to engage in race-based admissions in all but name.”141 It cited “UCLA’s own Task Force to \n17  Combat Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias” as revealing anti-Semitic incidents “antithetical to the safe \n18  and welcoming environment for effective research.”142 And it expressed “serious[] concern[]” that \n19  UCLA was “allowing males to compete in women’s sports and utilize women-only facilities, … \n20  create[ing] an unsafe environment for women that further threatens the integrity of the campus research \n21  environment.”143 \n22  203.  In an August 4, 2025 court filing in Thakur v. Trump, Case 3:25-cv-04737-RFL (N.D. \n23  Cal.), NSF stated that the July 30 and August 1 grant suspensions were based on “findings by the \n24  Department of Justice that UCLA violated federal civil rights law.”144 The Thakur court held that the \n25 \n \n26  140 Thakur, Dkt. 79-2. \n141 Id.  \n27 \n142 Id. \n143 Id. \n28 \n144 Id. \n  - 45 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 54 of 130\n \n \n1  suspensions violated its June 23, 2025 preliminary injunction, which barred the termination of grants \n2  with insufficiently specific explanations, and vacated those terminations.145 \n3  204.  Like NSF, on July 31, NIH sent a letter notifying UCLA that NIH was suspending \n4  hundreds of grant awards to UCLA, based on the same three conclusions of noncompliance listed in the \n5  August 1 NSF letter (in near-identical language): that UCLA was guilty of “illegal affirmative action,” \n6  “antisemitism and bias,” and “discriminat[ion] against and endanger[ing of] women.”146   \n7  205.  NIH provided the same explanation as did NSF regarding its concern about UCLA’s \n8  “holistic  review”  admissions  process,  elaborating  that  “UCLA’s  surreptitious—and  unlawful—\n9  prioritization of race over merit has significantly disadvantaged white and Asian applicants and must \n10  end.”147 “With respect to antisemitism,” NIH, like NSF, cited to UCLA’s Antisemitism Task Force, and \n11  also to the Republican Staff Report of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and \n12  the Workforce regarding antisemitism on 11 university campuses.148 NIH’s letter repeated concerns \n13  about  transgender  students,  warning  that  “NIH  cannot  sit  idly  by  as  a  major  grants  recipient \n14  systematically marginalizes its female students, faculty, and staff by stripping away necessities, like safe \n15  and secure bathrooms, and extracurricular opportunities.”149 \n16  206.  On September 22, 2025, the Thakur court preliminarily enjoined the NIH suspensions as \n17  well.150 \n18  207.  On July 30 or 31, 2025, the DOE suspended two UCLA grant awards. DOE sent similar \n19  letters basing the grant terminations on the same three noncompliance conditions on which NSF and \n20  NIH relied, namely, (1) race-based preferences in admissions practices, (2) the failure to promote an \n21  environment  free  of  antisemitism  and  bias,  and  (3)  discrimination  against  women  by  permitting \n22  transgender women to participate in extracurricular activities and to use women’s facilities. \n23 \n24   \n145 Thakur, Dkt. 96 at 7-8; see also id. at 11-12 (explaining that if preliminary injunction did not cover \n25  these grant terminations, modification would be appropriate). \n146 Thakur, Dkt. 118-1 at 2. \n26  147 Id. at 2-3 (citing a complaint filed in the Central District of California and a 2012 article by Richard \nSander). \n27 \n148 Id. at 3 (citing UCLA Task Force and Republican Staff Report). \n149 Id.  \n28 \n150 Thakur, Dkt. 133, 135. \n  - 46 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 55 of 130\n \n \n1  208.  Further, the Termination Letters are part of a broader Task Force Policy adopted by \n2  Defendants that also qualifies as final agency action. Defendants have adopted a new Task Force Policy \n3  that leverages the federal government’s enforcement authority over federal civil rights laws and federal \n4  grant program rules to impose and threaten legal and financial sanctions on universities for alleged but \n5  unproven civil rights violations, but without complying with those laws’ procedural requirements, and \n6  including financial sanctions not authorized under those laws, to coerce universities into implementing \n7  unrelated, ideological changes, including suppression of free speech, rights of association and academic \n8  freedom,  diversity  initiatives,  transgender  recognition,  equity  efforts,  and  whatever  else  the \n9  administration finds distasteful. A critical component of the Task Force Policy is that Defendants are \n10  sanctioning schools after cursory or nonexistent investigations, a marked change from Defendants’ \n11  previous rules governing Titles VI, VII, and IX investigations and federal funding. \n12 \nA.  Defendants  Disregard  Title  VI  Statutory  and  Regulatory  Requirements \nConstraining Termination of and Refusal to Grant Federal Funding. \n13 \n209.  NSF, NIH, and DOE terminated $584 million in grant funds to UCLA based on the DOJ’s \n14 \nfinding that UCLA had violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination \n15 \non the basis of race, color, or national origin in all programs receiving federal funding. 42 U.S.C. §2000d \n16 \n(“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from \n17 \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \n18 \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”). \n19 \n210.  Section 602 of Title VI, however, prescribes specific procedural requirements that federal \n20 \nagencies must follow before taking “any action terminating, or refusing to grant or continue, [federal \n21 \nfinancial] assistance because of failure to comply with [Section 601].” 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1.  \n22 \n211.  First, the agency must provide the funding recipient with notice of the alleged violation. \n23 \nBut that is only the first step. The agency must then attempt to secure the funding recipient’s voluntary \n24 \ncompliance. If the agency “has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,” then \n25 \nit must make “an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with \n26 \n[Section 601].” Id. Even then, it still cannot terminate funds. Rather, Section 602 provides that the agency \n27 \nmust then “file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the \n28 \n  - 47 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 56 of 130\n \n \n1  program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action,” \n2  and “[n]o [terminating] action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of \n3  such report.” Id. \n4  212.  Section 602 further limits the scope of funding that the agency may terminate after \n5  exhausting all these mandatory procedures, providing that any “termination or refusal [to grant or to \n6  continue assistance under Title VI] shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or \n7  other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and, shall be limited in its effect to the particular \n8  program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.” Id. (emphasis added). \n9  213.   These stringent procedural requirements and scope limitations for termination or refusal \n10  to grant or continue assistance reflect congressional intent to safeguard against the potential exploitation \n11  of Title VI funding leverage as a “vindictive or punitive” measure against federal funding recipients.151 \n12  From the very inception of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, lawmakers were aware of and concerned about \n13  the far-reaching authority Title VI grants the federal government over programs receiving federal funds. \n14  The congressional notice requirement, presidential approval of agency regulations implementing Title \n15  VI (discussed below), and requirement for a hearing on the record were all introduced as amendments \n16  to the original bill and were expressly aimed at preventing abuses of power.152 \n17  214.  Senator John Pastore from Rhode Island, who was the floor manager in the Senate for the \n18  Civil Rights Act of 1964, explained that “Failure of a recipient to comply with a rule, regulation, or order \n19  issued by an agency may ultimately lead to a termination or refusal of Federal assistance. Cutoff of \n20  assistance is not the object of title VI, however. I wish to repeat: Cutoff of assistance is not the objective \n21  of title VI. Fund cutoff is a last resort, to be used only if all else fails to achieve the real objective—the \n22  elimination of discrimination in the use and receipt of Federal funds.”153 \n23 \n \n24  151 88 Cong. Rec. 7063 (1964) (statement of Senator Pastore), \nhttps://www.congress.gov/88/crecb/1964/04/07/GPO-CRECB-1964-pt6-1-1.pdf, \n25 \nhttps://perma.cc/95VE-5QL8. \n152 See 88 Cong.

Senator Pastore further elaborated on the importance of the statutory and regulatory \n2  safeguards in ensuring that revocation of funding was “a last resort” rather than a “punitive or vindictive \n3  measure,” noting that “cutoff of funds would not be consistent with the objective of the Federal \n4  assistance statutes if other effective means of ending discrimination are available.”154 \n5  216.  Section 602 “direct[s]” federal agencies to “issu[e] rules, regulations, or orders of general \n6  applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the \n7  financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken.” 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1. Agencies are \n8  required to seek approval of those regulations from the President, id., who has delegated that authority \n9  to the Attorney General. The Attorney General oversees and coordinates enforcement of Title VI among \n10  federal agencies. See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 12250 (1980) at §§1–2; Exec. Order 11764, 3A C.F.R. §124 \n11  (1974 Comp.); Exec. Order 11247, 3 C.F.R. 1964–1965 Comp. 348 (Sept. 24, 1965). \n12  217.  Pursuant to Section 602, and consistent with this legislative intent, DOJ, NSF, HHS \n13  (whose regulations bind NIH), DOE, and other defendant agencies have promulgated regulations \n14  imposing  additional  procedural  requirements  on  the  termination  of  federal  funding  for  alleged \n15  noncompliance with Section 601. \n16  218.  These regulations typically provide that “[n]o order suspending, terminating or refusing \n17  to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until: (1) The responsible \n18  Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined \n19  that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) There has been an express finding on the \n20  record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a \n21  requirement imposed by or pursuant to this subpart, … and ([3]) The expiration of 30 days after the [head \n22  of the agency] has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having \n23  legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the \n24  grounds for such action.” 28 C.F.R. §42.108(c) (DOJ); see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.8(c) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. \n25  §80.8(c) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1 (applying the HHS implementing regulations for \n26  Title VI); 10 C.F.R. §1040.114 (DOE). \n27 \n28   \n154 Id. at 7059, 7063.  \n  - 49 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 58 of 130\n \n \n1  219.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to comply with the foregoing requirements \n2  before terminating funding on July 30-August 1. Among other things, Defendants did not attempt to \n3  secure the UC’s voluntary compliance, or determine that such compliance could not be achieved, before \n4  terminating $584 million in federal grants. Defendants did not provide an opportunity for hearing or \n5  make an express finding on the record as to the University’s noncompliance with Title VI. Nor did any \n6  “responsible Department official” determine that the University’s compliance could not be secured by \n7  voluntary means. Moreover, no head of any Federal department or agency has filed with any committees \n8  of the House and Senate a “full report of the circumstances and the grounds” for the action terminating \n9  or refusing to grant or continue federal assistance to the University because of a failure to comply with \n10  Title VI. Nor have thirty days elapsed after the filing of any such report.   \n11  220.  Additionally, Title VI regulations typically impose requirements on the conduct of pre-\n12  termination  hearings.  Among  other  requirements,  “[w]henever  an  opportunity  for  a  hearing  is \n13  required … reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to \n14  the affected applicant or recipient. That notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action \n15  proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, \n16  and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for that action. The notice shall (1) Fix a date not less \n17  than 20 days after the date of such notice, within which the applicant or recipient may request that the \n18  responsible Department official schedule the matter for hearing, or (2) advise the applicant or recipient \n19  that a hearing concerning the matter in question has been scheduled and advise the applicant or recipient \n20  of the place and time of that hearing.” 28 C.F.R. §42.109(a) (DOJ); see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.9(a) (NSF); \n21  45 C.F.R. §80.9(a) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. 10 C.F.R. §1040.121 (DOE) \n22  (establishing similar requirements regarding notice of opportunity for hearing). \n23  221.  Those regulations also typically further provide that “[t]he hearing, decision, and any \n24  administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5–8 of \n25  the Administrative Procedure Act),” and that “[b]oth the Department and the applicant or recipient shall \n26  be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as \n27  determined by the officer conducting the hearing.” 28 C.F.R. §42.109(d)(1) (DOJ); see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. \n28  §611.9(d)(1) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.9(d)(1) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1. All such \n  - 50 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 59 of 130\n \n \n1  evidence “shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and \n2  arguments advanced on either side of the issues,” and “[a] transcript shall be made of the oral evidence \n3  except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record.” 28 C.F.R. §42.109(d)(2) (DOJ); \n4  see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.9(d)(2) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.9(d)(2) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement \n5  4.1.2.1. \n6  222.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to comply with the foregoing procedures \n7  governing pre-termination hearings. Among other things, Defendants did not conduct a hearing at all or \n8  provide any notice. \n9  223.  These regulations also impose requirements regarding post-hearing termination decisions \n10  and notices. For example, “[i]f the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, such hearing examiner shall \n11  either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record, including his recommended \n12  findings and proposed decision, to the [responsible Department official] for a final decision, and a copy \n13  of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient.” 28 C.F.R. §42.110(a) \n14  (DOJ); see, e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.10(a) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.10(a) (HHS);  NIH Grants Policy Statement \n15  4.1.2.1. \n16  224.  Moreover, “[e]ach decision of a hearing officer or responsible Department official shall \n17  set  forth  his  ruling  on  each  findings,  conclusion,  or  exception  presented,  and  shall  identify  the \n18  requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart with which it is found that the \n19  applicant or recipient has failed to comply.” 28 C.F.R. §42.110(d) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §611.10(d) (NSF); \n20  45 C.F.R. §80.10(d) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. 10 C.F.R. §1040.121(b) (DOE) \n21  (“An applicant or recipient may ... waive or fail to request a hearing, without waiving the requirement \n22  for findings of fact and conclusions of law.”). And “[w]henever a record is certified to the responsible \n23  Department official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner ... the applicant or \n24  recipient shall be given a reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its \n25  contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible Department official shall be given in \n26  writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.” 28 C.F.R. §42.110(b) (DOJ); see, \n27  e.g., 45 C.F.R. §611.10(b) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.10(b) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. \n28 \n  - 51 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 60 of 130\n \n \n1  10 C.F.R. §1040.121(b) (DOE) (“[T]he applicant or recipient may also submit written information or \n2  argument for the record if he/she does not request a hearing.”). \n3  225.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to issue a decision consistent with the \n4  foregoing regulations. Among other things, Defendants did not provide the UC with a reasonable \n5  opportunity to file briefs or other written statements of its contentions.  \n6  226.  These Title VI regulations further provide that “[a]ny action to suspend or terminate or \n7  to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political \n8  entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall \n9  be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been \n10  so found.” 28 C.F.R. §42.108(c) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §611.8 (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.8(c) (HHS);  NIH Grants \n11  Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; 10 C.F.R. §1040.114(e) (DOE). \n12  227.  Defendants did not limit the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawals to any particular \n13  program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Nor was such withdrawal limited in \n14  its effect to any particular program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Rather, the \n15  withdrawal—and the effect of such withdrawal—is widespread and reaches departments and individuals, \n16  including Plaintiffs’ members, as to whom there has been no finding of noncompliance.  \n17  228.  Defendants’ failure to comply with Section 602 and the Defendant agencies’ respective \n18  regulations is not authorized by any law. \n19 \nB.  Defendants  Disregard  Title  IX  Statutory  and  Regulatory  Requirements \nConstraining Termination of and Refusal to Grant Federal Funding. \n20 \n229.  In summarily terminating $584 million in grant funds to UCLA, NSF, NIH, and DOE \n21 \ncited as an additional basis UCLA’s purported discrimination on the basis of sex, which is prohibited in \n22 \neducation programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance by Section 901 of Title IX of \n23 \nthe Civil Rights Act. 20 U.S.C. §1681(a). \n24 \n230.  Section 902 of Title IX, however, prescribes specific procedural requirements that federal \n25 \nagencies must follow before taking “any action terminating, or refusing to grant or continue, [federal \n26 \nfinancial] assistance because of failure to comply with [Section 901].” 20 U.S.C. §1682.  \n27 \n28 \n  - 52 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 61 of 130\n \n \n1  231.  First, the agency must provide the funding recipient with notice of the alleged violation. \n2  But that is only the first step. The agency must then attempt to secure the funding recipient’s voluntary \n3  compliance. If the agency “has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,” then \n4  it must make “an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with \n5  [Section 901].” Id. Even then, it still cannot terminate funds. Rather, Section 902 provides that the agency \n6  must then “file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the \n7  program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action,” \n8  and “[n]o [terminating] action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of \n9  such report.” Id. \n10  232.  Section 902 further limits the scope of funding that the agency may terminate after \n11  exhausting all these mandatory procedures, providing that any “termination or refusal [to grant or to \n12  continue assistance under Title IX] shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or \n13  other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and, shall be limited in its effect to the particular \n14  program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.” Id. (emphasis added). \n15  233.  These stringent procedural requirements and scope limitations are identical to the Title \n16  VI procedural requirements that, as discussed above, reflect congressional intent to safeguard against the \n17  potential exploitation of federal funding leverage as a “vindictive or punitive” measure against federal \n18  funding recipients. The congressional notice requirement, presidential approval of agency regulations \n19  implementing Title IX (discussed below), and requirement for a hearing on the record all mirror the Title \n20  VI requirements expressly aimed at preventing abuses of power. \n21  234.  Section 902 “direct[s]” federal agencies to “issu[e] rules, regulations, or orders of general \n22  applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the \n23  financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken.” 20 U.S.C. §1682. Agencies are \n24  required to seek approval of those regulations from the President, id., who has delegated that authority \n25  to the Attorney General, see Exec. Order No. 12250 (1980) at §1-102. The Attorney General oversees \n26  and coordinates enforcement of Title IX among federal agencies. Id. at §1-2. \n27  235.  Pursuant to Section 902, and consistent with this legislative intent, DOJ, NSF, HHS \n28  (whose regulations bind NIH), DOE, and other defendant agencies have promulgated regulations \n  - 53 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 62 of 130\n \n \n1  imposing  additional  procedural  requirements  on  the  termination  of  federal  funding  for  alleged \n2  noncompliance with Section 901. \n3  236.  Specifically,  these  agencies  have  “adopted  and  incorporated”  into  their  Title  IX \n4  implementing regulations the “procedural provisions applicable to Title VI” described above. 28 C.F.R. \n5  §54.605 (DOJ) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 28 CFR 42.106 through 42.111”); \n6  45 C.F.R. §618.605 (NSF) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 45 CFR part 611”); 45 \n7  C.F.R. §86.71 (HHS) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 45 CFR 80.6 through 80.11 \n8  and 45 CFR part 81”); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.2 (applying the HHS implementing regulations \n9  for Title IX); 10 C.F.R. §1042.605 (DOE) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 10 \n10  CFR part 1040, subparts G and H”). \n11  237.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendants  did  not  comply  with  any  of  the  foregoing \n12  requirements before terminating funding on July 30-August 1. Among other things, Defendants did not \n13  issue to the UC a notice of findings of any alleged violations of Title IX. Defendants did not attempt to \n14  secure the UC’s voluntary compliance before terminating $584 million in federal grants or determine \n15  that such voluntary compliance could not be achieved. Defendants did not provide an opportunity for \n16  hearing or make an express finding on the record as to the University’s noncompliance with Title IX. \n17  Nor did any “responsible Department official” determine that the University’s compliance could not be \n18  secured by voluntary means. Moreover, no head of any Federal department or agency has filed with any \n19  committees of the House and Senate a “full report of the circumstances and the grounds” for the action \n20  terminating or refusing to grant or continue federal assistance to the University because of a failure to \n21  comply with Title IX. Nor have thirty days elapsed after the filing of any such report. \n22  238.  Nor has any “responsible Department official or his designee” sought to resolve the \n23  University’s alleged violations of Section 901 through informal means before termination of funding by \n24  Defendants NSF and NIH, even though such informal resolution may have been possible. \n25  239.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to comply with the foregoing procedures \n26  governing pre-termination hearings. Among other things, Defendants did not conduct a hearing at all or \n27  provide any notice. \n28 \n  - 54 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 63 of 130\n \n \n1  240.  On information and belief, Defendants failed to issue a decision consistent with the \n2  foregoing regulations. Among other things, Defendants did not provide the UC with a reasonable \n3  opportunity to file briefs or other written statements of its contentions. \n4  241.  Defendants did not limit the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawals to any particular \n5  program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Nor was such withdrawal limited in \n6  its effect to any particular program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. Rather, the \n7  withdrawal—and the effect of such withdrawal—is widespread and reaches departments and individuals, \n8  including Plaintiffs’ members, as to whom there has been no finding of noncompliance.  \n9  242.  Defendants’ failure to comply with Section 902 and the Defendant agencies’ respective \n10  regulations is not authorized by any law. \n \n11 \nC.  Defendants  Fail  to  Provide  a  Reasoned  Decision  for  Terminating  $584 \nMillion in Research Grants. \n12 \n243.  Defendants failed to provide any reasoned basis for their actions.  \n13 \n244.  Defendants’ July 29 Notice of Findings; the NSF, NIH, and DOE grant termination \n14 \nletters; and the August 8 Demand Letter do not identify any specific evidence of any antisemitic \n15 \nharassment to which UC was deliberately indifferent, any specific evidence of race-based or gender \n16 \ndiscrimination, or any other evidence of wrongdoing. \n17 \n245.  Defendants have not acknowledged the efforts UCLA and other campuses in the UC \n18 \nSystem are making to address alleged antisemitism and prevent racial discrimination in admissions. UC \n19 \nhas issued a number of statements, studies, reports, and policy changes in response to complaints of \n20 \nantisemitism and discrimination on campus. Those have included the launch in 2024 of a Systemwide \n21 \nOffice of Civil Rights,155 a systemwide Anti-Discrimination Policy,156 and a systemwide directive on \n22 \npolicies impacting expressive activities.157 \n23 \n24 \n \n25 \n155 Systemwide Office of Civil Rights, Univ. of Cal.

Additionally, on December 20, 2024, the UC System announced it had entered into a \n2  voluntary agreement with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) to resolve \n3  claims of discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry, including shared Jewish, Israeli, \n4  Palestinian,  Arab,  and  Muslim  ancestry,  and  ensure  compliance  with  Title  VI.158  The  voluntary \n5  agreement relates to complaints of discrimination at the UCLA campus, as well as at the UC Davis, UC \n6  San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz campuses. The agreement established several \n7  reporting and review frameworks between the UCs and the OCR regarding anti-discrimination policy \n8  and campus safety, including responses to a protest or demonstration on a University campus. For \n9  example, pursuant to the voluntary agreement, UC agreed to provide any proposed revision to its \n10  systemwide anti-discrimination policies and procedures to OCR for its review and approval and to \n11  provide  annual  investigator  training  related  to  discrimination  and  harassment  based  on  actual  or \n12  perceived  national  origin,  including  shared  Jewish,  Palestinian,  Muslim,  and/or  Arab  ancestry  or \n13  association with these national origins/ancestries. Under the voluntary agreement, “[i]f OCR has any \n14  concerns  about  the  adequacy  of  the  University’s  rationale  to  not  open  an  investigation  or  its \n15  investigations or any of its proposed remedial or corrective actions, OCR will communicate those \n16  concerns to the University in writing[,]” and “the University will respond to address OCR’s concerns \n17  with proposed revised corrective action(s)” “[w]ithin 30 calendar days of receiving notice of any such \n18  concerns.”159  \n19  247.  Defendants’ July 29 Notice of Findings, funding termination letters, and August 8 \n20  Demand Letter do not explain why the procedures, reporting, and commitments that are set forth in the \n21  December 20, 2024 voluntary agreement are insufficient to address the allegations of antisemitism \n22  contained in those findings, termination letters, and demand. The Notice of Findings merely notes a \n23  December 20, 2024 agreement as a document DOJ reviewed, explains the concerns raised by OCR, and \n24 \n \n25 \n158 UC reaches voluntary agreement with U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, Univ. \n26  of Cal. (Dec. 20, 2024), https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/employee-news/uc-reaches-voluntary-\nagreement-with-u-s-department-of-education-office-for-civil-rights/; see also Resolution Agreement \n27 \nbetween U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights and the University of California (Dec. \n18, 2024), https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-agreements/09222257-b.pdf. \n28 \n159 University of California Resolution Agreement, supra note 156. \n  - 56 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 65 of 130\n \n \n1  fails entirely to acknowledge steps OCR and UC agreed to in that voluntary agreement.160 Defendants’ \n2  failure to do so is unreasonable and arbitrary given that the July 29 Notice of Findings, along with the \n3  funding termination letters and August 8 Demand Letter, cite only to events that occurred prior to the \n4  OCR’s December 20 voluntary agreement with UC and are addressed by the provisions of the voluntary \n5  agreement. The Notice of Findings, funding termination letters, and August 8 Demand Letter do not \n6  identify any specific allegations of antisemitism that were not addressed by the December 20, 2024 \n7  voluntary agreement; nor do they state that the December 20, 2024 voluntary agreement has been \n8  insufficient to address the allegations of antisemitism, including those set forth in the October 2024 \n9  report of the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias at UCLA. \n10  248.  Defendants have also failed, in issuing the Notice of Findings, the funding terminations, \n11  and the August 8 Demand Letter, to address actions taken by UCLA as part of and pursuant to a \n12  settlement of Frankel v. Regents of University of California. That lawsuit, filed June 5, 2024 by three \n13  Jewish students from UCLA and a UCLA professor against the Regents, claimed that UCLA had \n14  subjected Jewish students to discrimination and a hostile environment in violation of Title VI of the Civil \n15  Rights Act.161 In settling this litigation, UC agreed to be bound by a Consent Judgment and Permanent \n16  Injunction prohibiting UCLA from offering any programs, activities, or campus areas that are not fully \n17  and equally accessible to Jewish students, faculty, and/or staff as to other students, faculty, and/or staff, \n18  and,  among  other  things,  agreed  to  contribute  $2.33  million  to  eight  organizations  that  combat \n19  antisemitism and support the UCLA Jewish community and $320,000 to UCLA’s Initiative to Combat \n20  Antisemitism, an effort announced by UCLA in March 2025.162 The Initiative seeks to implement the \n21  recommendations of the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias. In announcing the \n22  Frankel settlement, UC also identified other steps it had taken to combat antisemitism.163  \n23   \n160 U.S. Department of Justice Notice of Findings Regarding the University of California, Los Angeles, \n24 \nat 2 & n.2 (July 29, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1409416/dl?inline. \n25  161 Compl., Frankel v.

The Frankel settlement was executed on July 28 and was publicly released by no later \n2  than July 29, 2025. Nonetheless, DOJ issued its Notice of Findings that UCLA was in violation of Title \n3  VI due to allegations of antisemitism on campus on July 29, 2025. The Notice of Findings did not address \n4  the Frankel settlement or the UCLA Initiative to Combat Antisemitism; nor has DOJ or any Defendant \n5  subsequently  addressed  the  impact  of  the  Frankel  settlement,  the  UCLA  Initiative  to  Combat \n6  Antisemitism, or any other of the actions UCLA and UC have implemented to address allegations of \n7  antisemitism. The Notice of Findings states that DOJ reviewed the “pleadings and other materials \n8  referenced” in Frankel,164 but makes no reference to the settlement. \n9  250.  Similarly,  on  July  30,  July  31,  and  August  1,  Defendants  NSF  and  NIH,  and  on \n10  information and belief DOE, issued letters withdrawing funding from UCLA purportedly on the basis of \n11  complaints  about  antisemitism  on  campus  without  addressing  the  December  20,  2024  voluntary \n12  agreement between UC and OCR, the Frankel settlement, the UCLA Initiative to Combat Antisemitism, \n13  or any other steps UC identified as addressing these complaints.  \n14  251.  DOJ, in its Notice of Findings, relies heavily on the UCLA Task Force Report from \n15  October  2024,  but  does  not  acknowledge,  let  alone  address,  the  UCLA  Initiative  to  Combat \n16  Antisemitism, which seeks to implement the recommendations of the Task Force Report. DOJ provides \n17  no explanation of its failure to do so. \n18  252.  The Notice of Findings is based entirely on events in the spring of 2024 related to an \n19  encampment on UCLA’s campus to protest Israel’s military actions in Gaza and student complaints \n20  received between April 25 and May 1, 2024.165 DOJ does not cite to or rely on any occurrences of \n21  antisemitism that occurred outside this time period. And yet DOJ, in its July 29, 2025 Notice of Findings, \n22  does not cite to or consider any steps taken by UC and/or UCLA since May 2, 2024 to address complaints \n23  of antisemitism and discrimination. \n24  253.  NSF cites no factual or legal basis for its suspension of awards in its July 30, 2025 letter. \n25  In its August 1, 2025 Updated Notice, NSF purports to base the award suspensions on concerns regarding \n26  antisemitism “during the 2024 pro-Palestinian encampment,” citing solely to the UCLA Task Force \n27 \n \n164 University of California Resolution Agreement, supra note 156, at 2 & n.2. \n28 \n165 Notice of Findings, supra note 158, at 3-6. \n  - 58 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 67 of 130\n \n \n1  report as evidence of “noncompliance” with “applicable Federal statutes and regulations” “[w]ith respect \n2  to  antisemitism.”166  NIH  similarly  cites  to  the  UCLA  Task  Force  findings  as  evidence  of  non-\n3  compliance. Yet neither NSF nor NIH addresses, or even acknowledges, the UCLA Initiative to Combat \n4  Antisemitism, or any other steps the UC and/or UCLA have taken to address the findings of the Task \n5  Force. NIH’s July 31, 2025 letter suspending grant awards also cites, “[w]ith respect to antisemitism,” a \n6  Republican Staff Report that investigated antisemitism on 11 university campuses and which includes \n7  information regarding the events at UCLA in late April and early May 2024.167  \n8  254.  Defendants  have  not  made  a  reasoned  determination  whether  UC’s  and  UCLA’s \n9  responses to complaints of antisemitism and discrimination on campus were or were not sufficient under \n10  Title VI, and Defendants did not make any such determination prior to sending the July 29 Findings, the \n11  funding termination letters, or the August 8 Demand Letter.  \n12  255.   The NIH and NSF funding termination letters and, on information and belief, the DOE \n13  funding termination letter, cite concerns about UCLA’s “holistic review” admissions process and asserts \n14  that it is “a transparent attempt to engage in race-based admissions in all but name.”168 NSF and NIH, \n15  however, recognize that “UCLA expressly disclaims reliance on race.” That UCLA may consider an \n16  applicant’s zip code or personal statement is not unlawful and the funding termination letters do not \n17  come close to establishing the presence of unlawful race-based admissions processes. The agencies’ \n18  citation to UCLA websites explaining its admissions process is simply not a reasonable basis for finding \n19  that UCLA has engaged in unlawful practices. NIH also cites to allegations in a First Amended \n20  Complaint filed in June 2025 in the District Court for the Central District of California, Students Against \n21  Racial Discrimination v. The Regents of the University of California, C.D. Case No. 8:25-cv-00192, but \n22  a complaint’s allegations are not evidence and it is unreasonable for NIH to rely on such allegations as \n23  a basis for concluding that UCLA is engaged in unlawful, race-based practices. NIH’s reliance on a 2012 \n24 \n25 \n \n26 \n166 Thakur, Dkt. 79-2 at 2-3 (Aug. 1, 2025 NSF letter). \n167 Thakur, Dkt. 118-1 at 3 (July 31, 2025 NIH letter, citing Republican Staff Report, \n27 \nhttps://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/10.30.24_committee_on_education_and_the_workforce_r\n28  epublican_staff_report_-_antisemitism_on_college_campuses_exposed.pdf). \n168 Thakur, Dkt. 79-2 at 1; Thakur, Dkt. 118-1 at 2-3. \n  - 59 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 68 of 130\n \n \n1  article by Richard Sander is also an entirely insufficient and unreasonable basis on which to conclude \n2  that UCLA is engaged in unlawful practices. \n3  256.  The NIH, NSF, and DOE funding termination letters are unreasonably based on purported \n4  concerns about UCLA’s policies allowing transgender women access to extracurricular opportunities \n5  and facilities, and apparent conclusion that these policies “fail[] to comply with federal requirements, \n6  policies, and procedures.”169  The only evidence cited by the agencies is a UCLA Gender Recognition \n7  Taskforce: Recommendations Report from 2020 and, for NIH, a 2019 map showing gender-inclusive \n8  restrooms. The Taskforce’s recommendations focus on how to address and comply with new state law \n9  and nothing in the report constitutes evidence of unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex. Defendants’ \n10  reliance on this report for its finding that UCLA has failed to comply with federal law is unreasonable \n11  and arbitrary and capricious. NIH’s additional reliance on a map of bathrooms is similarly unreasonably \n12  and arbitrary, and cannot support any finding of unlawful discrimination.     \n13  257.  Defendants also have provided no basis for the breadth of their attacks on and threats to \n14  UC’s federal funding. For example, Defendants have not explained which grants have been selected for \n15  review and potential termination and on what basis, or whether these grants have any connection to any \n16  alleged Title VI violation. Nor have Defendants identified any such connection for the grants they have \n17  terminated or for which they have declined to disburse funding since July 30, 2025. \n18  258.  The lack of any connection between Defendants’ funding freezes, threatened funding \n19  cuts, and unconstitutional conditions, and Defendants’ purported legal basis for those freezes, cuts, and \n20  conditions, has exacerbated the harm to Plaintiffs and their members, as Plaintiffs and their members do \n21  not know and cannot anticipate whether any program receiving federal funding will be impacted, \n22  requiring all such programs to prepare for the possibility of significant and immediate termination of \n23  funding. \n24  259.  Defendants  also  have  not  reasonably  considered  the  enormous  reliance  interests \n25  implicated by their freezing of hundreds of millions of dollars supporting critical research and other \n26  activities. The funding termination letters make no mention of the incalculable damage that Defendants’ \n27  actions will cause—to patients whose clinical trials will end, faculty whose careers will be derailed, \n28   \n169 Thakur, Dkt. 79-2 at 1-2; Thakur, Dkt. 118-1 at 3-4. \n  - 60 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 69 of 130\n \n \n1  research partners around the world whose studies are in jeopardy, and the public who will no longer \n2  benefit from the research those federal grants support. NIH’s and NSF’s statements that they “considered \n3  UCLA’s reliance interests in continued availability of funding” for the suspended grant awards and “they \n4  are outweighed by the concerns” identified in the funding termination letters are not supported by any \n5  reasoned analysis and are arbitrary and capricious, as the district court found in Thakur.170  \n6  260.  Defendants also have failed to explain the basis for any of the many conditions they have \n7  imposed and, on information and belief, seek to impose on UC (including on UCLA), nor have they \n8  explained how those demands would bring UC into compliance with Title VI, Title VII, or Title IX. \n9 \nD.  Defendants Demand that the UC Pay $1 Billion as Ransom, Despite No \nLawful Basis for Demanding Such Payment.  \n10 \n261.  Shortly after Defendants abruptly cut off $584 million in grant funding, the UC reached \n11 \nout to the Department of Justice and offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the DOJ. \n12 \n262.  On or about August 8, 2025, the UC received a document (“August 8 Demand Letter”) \n13 \nfrom the DOJ demanding that UCLA pay $1 billion or more as part of a settlement to restore the $584 \n14 \nmillion that had already been cut.171 The August 8 Demand Letter specifies that if its demands are met \n15 \nthen the terminated $584 million in grants will be restored, but specifies that it does not prevent the \n16 \nfederal administration from taking further legal actions against or asserting new claims against UCLA \n17 \nincluding under Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, or other provisions of federal law. \n18 \n263.  On information and belief, there has been no finding of any Title VI (or Title VII or Title \n19 \nIX) violation on the record. Even if there had been, neither DOJ nor any other Defendant is authorized \n20 \nby law to demand a $1 billion monetary penalty for violations of Title VI, Title VII, or Title IX. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \n25  170 Thakur, Dkt. 96 at 2. \n171 Statement from UC President James B.

Upon receiving DOJ’s demands, UC President James Milliken issued a public statement \n2  that same day stating, “[A] payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest \n3  public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”172 \n4  265.  In a letter to California Legislators dated September 3, 2025, UC President Milliken \n5  described the Trump administration’s actions as posing “one of the gravest threats in UC’s 157-year \n6  history,” explaining that “[r]ecent actions by the federal government with the distinct possibility of more \n7  to come, place the entire University of California system at risk, and by extension the many Californians \n8  and communities we serve.”173 \n9  266.  As UC President Milliken explained, “the stakes are high, and the risks are very real.” \n10  The UC receives more than $17 billion per year from the federal government, including $9.9 billion in \n11  Medicare and Medicaid funding, $5.7 billion in research funding, and $1.9 billion in student financial \n12  aid per year. The UC President warned: “A substantial loss of federal funding would devastate our \n13  university and cause enormous harm to our students, our patients, and all Californians. Classes and \n14  student services would be reduced, patients would be turned away, tens of thousands of jobs would be \n15  lost, and we would see UC’s world-renowned researchers leaving our state for other more seemingly \n16  stable opportunities in the US or abroad. It is hard to conceive of a more damaging consequence for our \n17  state.”174 \n18  267.  On September 15, 2025, UC President Milliken sent an email to the entire UC community \n19  in which he addressed the Los Angeles Times’ reporting regarding the Trump administration’s “demand \n20  that  the  university  pay  the  federal  government  over  $1  billion”  and  described  the  reporting  as \n21  “summarizing some of the administration’s demands.”175 President Milliken also confirmed that “the \n22  federal government is … pursuing investigations and actions … against all 10 UC campuses.”176 \n23 \n \n24  172 Id. \n173 Letter from James B.

Milliken to the UC Community, Univ. of Cal. \n27 \nPress Room (Sept. 15, 2025), https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/letter-president-\n28  james-b-milliken-uc-community. \n176 Id. \n  - 62 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 71 of 130\n \n \n1  President Milliken described the scope of federal funding at risk and noted that “[t]he funds at risk \n2  support the doctors and nurses who care for millions of Californians each year, the researchers working \n3  to find new cures and make important technological discoveries, and the financial aid that keeps UC \n4  accessible for students of all backgrounds”; and asserted that a loss of this federal funding “will mean \n5  fewer classes and student services, reduced access to health care, tens of thousands of lost jobs across \n6  the state, and an exodus of world-class faculty and researchers to other states or countries.”177   \n7  268.  Losing a sizeable portion of federal funding would have a significant impact on the UC’s \n8  budget. The UC’s operating revenue in 2024-2025 was approximately $53 billion.178 The federal \n9  government’s threats have put billions of the University’s budget at risk. The $17 billion of UC funding \n10  that UC President Milliken has identified as coming from the federal government comprises almost one-\n11  third of the UC’s budget. \n12  269.  According to UC budget documents, federal funds accounted for 52 percent of all UC \n13  research expenditures in 2023-24, and “were the University’s single most important source of support \n14  for research.”179 Similarly, “[f]ederal student aid programs represent the single largest source of financial \n15  aid for UC students.”180 \n \n16 \nE.  Defendants Demand that, in Exchange for Federal Funding, the UC Agree to \nInfringe the Free Speech and Academic Freedom Rights of Its Faculty, \n17 \nStudents, Academic Employees, and Staff. \n18 \n270.  The August 8 Demand Letter makes a number of demands upon UCLA that would \n19 \nimpinge on the free speech and academic freedom rights of UCLA’s faculty, students,  academic \n20 \nemployees, and staff employees.181 \n21 \n22 \n23   \n177 Id. \n24  178 Mikhail Zinshteyn, UC faces half-billion-dollar budget shortfall and increases tuition for new \nnonresident students, Cal Matters (Nov. 14, 2024), https://calmatters.org/education/higher-\n25  education/2024/11/uc-regents/. \n179 Budget for Current Operations: Context for the Budget Request, 2025-26, Univ. of Cal., \n26  https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2025-26-budget-detail.pdf, at 21. \n180 Id. at 22. \n27 \n181 Jaweed Kaleem, Here are the details of Trump’s $1.2-billion call to remake UCLA in a \n28  conservative image, L.A.

For example, the August 8 Demand Letter demands that UCLA prohibit demonstrations, \n2  protests, displays, and other expressive activities in specified locations on the UCLA campus; prohibit \n3  overnight demonstrations in any location; and prohibit demonstrators from wearing masks in order to \n4  protest anonymously.182  \n5  272.  The August 8 Demand Letter makes additional demands that would inhibit speech by \n6  non-citizen students, including requiring UCLA to share disciplinary records of international students \n7  with  the  federal  government  and  to  implement  policies  that  ensure  it  does  not  recruit  or  admit \n8  international  students  who  are  “likely  to  engage  in  anti-Western,  anti-American,  or  antisemitic \n9  disruptions or harassment,” and implement trainings to “socialize” international students to campus \n10  norms.183  \n11  273.  On information and belief, the August 8 Demand Letter also demands cooperation with \n12  local and federal law enforcement and does not except cooperation with federal immigration authorities \n13  from this demand. \n14  274.  The August 8 Demand Letter demands appointment of a resolution monitor and gives \n15  that monitor significant authority over campus affairs; if UCLA and the administration cannot reach \n16  agreement on who should be appointed as that monitor, the letter demands that the administration have \n17  the authority to appoint that individual.184 \n18  275.  The August 8 Demand Letter requires a review of policies and programs related to \n19  diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including, on information and belief, faculty hiring, retention, \n20  and promotion; a process for approving any curricular changes; and recommendations for academic \n21  restructuring across programs. \n22  276.  Besides the requirement to provide the disciplinary records of international students, the \n23  August 8 Demand Letter demands that the federal government have access to and the ability to regularly \n24  view a wide variety of records of academic employees, staff employees, faculty, and students, as deemed \n25 \n26 \n \n27 \n182 Id. \n28  183 Id. \n184 Id. \n  - 64 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 73 of 130\n \n \n1  necessary by the resolution monitor.185 The only exception is for attorney-client privilege, not for speech, \n2  association, or privacy purposes.186  \n3  277.  On information and belief, the August 8 Demand Letter requires regular reports to the \n4  external monitor regarding all of these measures. \n5  278.  In  making  these  demands,  the  Trump  administration  is  seeking  to  impose  speech \n6  restrictions upon students, faculty, academic employees, and staff employees that would violate the First \n7  Amendment if imposed directly either by the university itself or by the federal government.  \n \n8 \nF.  Defendants Demand that, in Exchange for Federal Funding, the UC Agree to \nMeasures to Limit Lawful Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Efforts. \n9 \n10  279.  The August 8 Demand Letter also makes demands aimed at ending UCLA’s lawful \n11  diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including a review of policies and programs related to such efforts \n12  in faculty and other staff hiring, retention, and promotion.187 \n13  280.  Under the August 8 Demand Letter’s demands, UCLA would eliminate supposed racial \n14  preferences and ensure what the federal government deems to be merit-based practices.   \n15  281.  Included among those demands are that UCLA must end any race or ethnicity-based \n16  scholarships and remove eligibility criteria deemed discriminatory.188 \n17  282.  Further, the letter demands the end to the use of the following: any “proxy” for race in \n18  the admissions, hiring, or promotions processes; any “indirect methods or criteria that serve as a \n19  substitute for race-conscious hiring, promotion, tenure, compensation, and other employment practices”; \n20  and any “personal statements, diversity narratives, or an applicant’s [own] reference to racial identity.”189 \n21  Although UCLA does not consider standardized test scores in its admissions process, the document \n22  requires  disclosure  of  test  scores  and  other  admissions  information,  by  race  and  gender,  to  the \n23  administration and the general public.190 \n24 \n \n25  185 Id. \n186 Id. \n26 \n187 Id. Notably, the University of California does not engage in affirmative action and has not done so \nin almost 30 years, since the implementation of Proposition 209.  \n27 \n188 Id. \n28  189 Id. \n190 Id. \n  - 65 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 74 of 130\n \n \n1  283.  The bar on the use of “proxies” appears modeled after demands made by the Department \n2  of Education’s Office for Civil Rights’ February 14, 2025 “Dear Colleague” letter, which, among other \n3  things, falsely deems numerous lawful means to recruit and admit a diverse student body, and to establish \n4  a diverse and inclusive college community, to be unlawful under Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. \n5  President & Fellows of Harvard College (“SFFA”), 600 U.S. 181 (2023), among other authorities. \n6  Contrary to that view, for example, SFFA specifically contemplates that universities may consider \n7  personal statements wherein an applicant includes a “discussion of how race affected his or her life, be \n8  it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.” 600 U.S. at 230; cf. also Parents Involved in Cmty. \n9  Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 788-89 (2007) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (discussing \n10  “race-conscious measures” to achieve equal educational opportunity “without treating each student in \n11  [a] different fashion solely on the basis of a systematic, individual typing by race”).   \n12  284.  That February 14, 2025 “Dear Colleague” letter has been held unlawful and vacated in \n13  its entirety. See AFT v. Dep’t of Educ., __ F.Supp.3d __, 2025 WL 2374697 (D. Md. Aug. 14, 2025). \n14  Because the Trump administration cannot impose these measures directly, it is attempting to use funding \n15  conditions to coerce the UC to comply. \n16  285.  On information and belief, the August 8 Demand Letter requires regular reports to the \n17  external monitor regarding all of these measures, including how UCLA is working to end supposedly \n18  discriminatory programs and policies. \n19  286.  Notably, on information and belief, the August 8 Demand Letter includes only minimal \n20  measures that address anti-Semitism at all. \n \n21 \nG.  Defendants Demand that, in Exchange for Federal Funding, the UC Agree to \nViolate the Rights of Transgender Individuals. \n22 \n23  287.  The August 8 Demand Letter demands a number of changes in UCLA’s policies as relates \n24  to transgender students and other transgender individuals. \n25  288.  Among the demands are that UCLA make a public statement, and post that statement on \n26  UCLA’s websites, that  UCLA does not recognize transgender people’s gender identities and,  on \n27  information and belief, that it agrees with the administration’s definitions of “male,” “female,” and “sex,” \n28 \n  - 66 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 75 of 130\n \n \n1  as set  forth  in  Executive Order 14168. Section 2 of that  executive order  includes the following \n2  definitions:  \n3  (a)  “Sex” shall refer to an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male \n4  or female. “Sex” is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of “gender identity.” \n5  … \n6  (d)  “Female” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large \n7  reproductive cell. \n8  (e)  “Male” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small \n9  reproductive cell.  \n10  289.  Besides making a public statement, the August 8 Demand Letter demands that UCLA \n11  rescind any guidance that allows equal participation by transgender students in UCLA sports and, on \n12  information and belief, that it review and rescind all records, titles, honors, and awards previously \n13  granted to transgender athletes; issue a personal apology letter to any cisgender women who did not \n14  receive such records, titles, honors, and awards as a result of transgender athletics participation; and \n15  refrain from delegating its obligation to comply with Title IX to any outside entity. \n16  290.  Outside the realm of athletic participation, the August 8 Demand Letter demands that \n17  UCLA bar gender inclusive and gender appropriate use of locker rooms, dorm rooms, and restrooms, by \n18  restricting access to such spaces based on individuals’ sex assigned at birth.191 \n19  291.  The terms of the August 8 Demand Letter terms reportedly apply to UC’s medical centers, \n20  and demand that regardless of medical judgment the UC medical centers refrain from providing any \n21  gender affirming medical care, including “hormonal interventions,” to individuals under the age of 18.192 \n22  292.  The August 8 Demand Letter’s demands would require the UC to violate federal anti-\n23  discrimination law as well as California laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual \n24  orientation, or gender identity.   \n25 \n26 \n27 \n \n28  191 Id. \n192 Id. \n  - 67 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 76 of 130\n \n \nH.  Defendants Threaten to Impose the Same Demands on the Entire UC System. \n1 \n293.  Beyond the DOJ’s July 29 Notice of Findings to UCLA, Defendants have launched a \n2 \nbarrage of additional purported civil rights investigations against the UC System and various UC \n3 \ncampuses that remain pending.  \n4 \n294.  On February 3, 2025, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) \n5 \nopened an investigation under Title VI against UC Berkeley (and four other universities) pursuant to \n6 \nPresident Trump’s Executive Order, “Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism.”193 \n7 \n295.  On March 5, 2025, the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that DOJ \n8 \nhad opened a civil pattern or practice investigation into the UC under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \n9 \nof 1964, to “assess whether UC has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination based on race, \n10 \nreligion and national origin against its professors, staff and other employees by allowing an Antisemitic \n11 \nhostile work environment to exist on its campuses.”194 \n12 \n296.  On March 10, 2025, OCR sent a letter “warn[ing] of potential enforcement actions” to \n13 \nUC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Berkeley, along with 56 other universities that \n14 \nOCR stated were “under investigation or monitoring in response to complaints filed with OCR” for \n15 \nalleged Title VI violations.195 \n16 \n297.  On March 14, 2025, OCR announced it was opening Title VI investigations into UC \n17 \nBerkeley, along with 44 other universities, pursuant to OCR’s February 14 “Dear Colleague Letter” \n18 \nrequiring all educational institutions to “cease all efforts to circumvent prohibitions on the use of race \n19 \nby relying on proxies or other indirect means to accomplish such ends” and to “cease all reliance on \n20 \nthird-party contractors, clearinghouses, or aggregators that are being used by institutions in an effort to \n21 \ncircumvent prohibited uses of race.”196 OCR stated that the March 14 investigations were prompted by \n22 \n23 \n \n193 U.S. Department of Education Probes Cases of Antisemitism at Five Universities, U.S. Dep’t of \n24 \nEduc.

On June 26, 2025, DOJ notified the UC that it was opening a new Title VII investigation \n5  into the UC System, “including the individual University of California campuses,” to determine whether \n6  the UC’s “UC 2030 Capacity Plan” caused  a pattern or practice of unlawful  race- or sex-based \n7  employment discrimination.198 \n8  299.  On May 9, 2025, the DOJ launched its Title VI investigation of the entire UC System’s \n9  response to antisemitism. On information and belief, the DOJ’s investigation of the remaining UC \n10  campuses other than UCLA “remains ongoing.”199 \n11  300.  On information and belief, while the August 8 Demand Letter is facially directed only at \n12  UCLA, Defendants have informed the UC that the same demands enumerated in the August 8 Demand \n13  Letter to UCLA will be made to the rest of the UC System, except that the amount demanded will be \n14  greater than $1 billion. \n \n15 \nV.  Defendants’ Coercive Attacks Have Harmed and Will Continue to Irreparably \nHarm Plaintiffs and Their Members if Not Enjoined. \n16 \n \n17  A.  Defendants’  Coercive  Demands  Have  Already  Caused  UC  to  Begin \nInfringing on the Academic Freedom, Free Speech, Privacy, and Other \n18  Rights of Faculty, Students, Academic Employees, and Staff Employees. \n19  301.  Defendants’ threats and coercive conduct have caused a pervasive sense of fear and \n20  intimidation among UC faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees, who have seen the \n21  UC already begin to alter its policies and practices seemingly in capitulation to the Trump administration. \n22  Defendants’ coercive threats, and the UC’s foreseeable response, have had a widespread chilling effect. \n23  302.  For example, on or about August 6, 2025, the UC announced a new policy expanding \n24  Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (“ICE”) access to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, \n \n25 \n197 Office for Civil Rights Initiates Title VI Investigations into Institutions of Higher Education, U.S. \nDep’t of Educ.

Dhillon, Assistant Attorney General, to Michael Drake, President, \n27 \nUniversity of California (June 26, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1404751/dl.  \n28  199 Letter from Harmeet K. Dhillon, Assistant Attorney General, to Michael Drake, President, \nUniversity of California (July 29, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1409416/dl?inline. \n  - 69 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 78 of 130\n \n \n1  Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center, Orthopedic Hospital, and Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at \n2  UCLA, and UCLA West Valley Medical Center. This new policy has caused widespread fear among \n3  Plaintiffs’ members, many of whom are immigrants and fear for themselves and their family members \n4  who work at, study at, or receive health services at UCLA medical centers. \n5  303.  As another example, on September 12, 2025, it was reported that UC Berkeley provided \n6  the Trump administration’s Department of Education the names of 160 faculty members, students, \n7  academic employees, and staff employees who are members of Plaintiffs and whose names have \n8  appeared in reports of “alleged antisemitic incidents.”200 It was reported that UC Berkeley’s usual \n9  procedures for handling complaints had been suspended, and that UC Berkeley’s disclosure of names \n10  was directed by the UC Office of the General Counsel. Some of the individuals whose names were \n11  disclosed to the federal government had never even been informed that a complaint had been filed with \n12  the University against them, nor were they informed of the basis for the alleged charges, let alone \n13  afforded an opportunity to contest the allegations. It was also reported that UC Berkeley did not notify \n14  the affected individuals that their names had been disclosed to the federal government until weeks after \n15  the fact. Those whose names were disclosed to the federal government have been directly harmed by the \n16  disclosure, and the reports of this disclosure have had far-reaching chilling effects through the UC \n17  community. \n18  304.  If the UC accedes to some or all of the Trump administration’s demands, Plaintiffs’ \n19  members will face further injury. \n20  305.  The Trump administration’s demanded restrictions on workers’, students’, faculty, and \n21  others’ demonstrations and expressive activity in certain locations and at certain times, and the demand \n22  that protestors not be permitted to protest anonymously, if implemented, would infringe on the First \n23  Amendment rights of Plaintiffs’ members who wish to participate in such expressive activity. \n24  306.  If implemented, the demands to share disciplinary records of international students with \n25  the  federal  government,  to  avoid  recruitment  of  “anti-Western”  or  “anti-American”  international \n26  students, and to “socialize” international students interfere with the expressive rights of Plaintiffs’ \n \n27 \n200 UC Berkeley shares 160 names with Trump administration in ‘McCarthy era’ move, The Guardian \n28  (Sept. 12, 2025), https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/uc-berkeley-trump-\nadministration-antisemitism.  \n  - 70 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 79 of 130\n \n \n1  international student members and the rights of other of Plaintiffs’ members to hear the uninhibited views \n2  of those international students, particularly given the absence of any universally accepted definition of \n3  “anti-Western” or “anti-American.” The entirely vague but ominous threat to international students’ \n4  visas and the students’ ability to express dissent from dominant ideologies would also inhibit solidarity \n5  between University employees, their unions, and students from around the world. \n6  307.  The demand to cooperate with law enforcement including immigration authorities, if \n7  implemented, will harm Plaintiffs’ members who face potential harassment and adverse actions from \n8  immigration authorities and will also have a chilling effect on speech and on the ability to receive \n9  necessary health care. Thousands of Plaintiffs’ members are health care providers and/or receive their \n10  health care from UC providers. \n11  308.  The  demands  to  review  all  diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion  policies  and  programs, \n12  including as relate to faculty hiring, retention, and promotion, as well as the process for approving \n13  curricular changes and for academic restructuring across programs, if implemented, would infringe on \n14  academic freedom and harm Plaintiffs’ members who rely on and benefit from such programs and \n15  curriculum. It would also infringe on free speech and free association rights. \n16  309.  If implemented, the demand to eliminate supposed racial preferences and ensure what \n17  Defendants term merit-based practices, including by ending all race or ethnicity-based scholarships and \n18  any supposedly discriminatory eligibility criteria and by ending the use of purported “proxies” for race \n19  in the admissions process including through personal statements, would harm Plaintiffs’ members by \n20  infringing on their free speech rights, reducing the diversity of the UC student body, and preventing the \n21  wholistic assessment of student applicants. \n22  310.  The demand to make and publicize a statement that UCLA does not recognize transgender \n23  people’s gender identities and agrees with the Trump administration’s definitions of “male,” “female,” \n24  and “sex,” and implement that definition by ending gender-inclusive policies as relates to restrooms and \n25  other private spaces and stripping previously awarded athletics honors from transgender athletes, if \n26  implemented, would harm Plaintiffs’ members, including transgender members. \n27 \n28 \n  - 71 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 80 of 130\n \n \n1  311.  If implemented, the demand that medical centers cease provision of gender-affirming care \n2  to minors would harm Plaintiffs’ members with transgender children who receive medical care through \n3  the University. \n4  312.  The demands to cede authority to a government-appointed external monitor, to give the \n5  federal government access to and the ability to regularly view a wide variety of records of academic \n6  employees, staff employees, faculty, and students as deemed necessary by the monitor, harms all of \n7  Plaintiffs’ members by chilling speech and academic discourse.  \n8  313.  The Trump administration’s demands have already impacted the content of the work the \n9  University is willing to support. For example, in November 2024, UCLA submitted to a private funder \n10  a grant proposal that an interdisciplinary team of UCLA faculty had prepared. The proposal sought \n11  support for a project  concerning academic freedom, including specifically in the context of pro-\n12  Palestinian speech. UCLA selected this proposal following a competitive internal review process, and \n13  senior administrators at the University committed more than $140,000 in University matching funds to \n14  support the initiative that was the subject of the grant. When the private funder later requested that the \n15  team demonstrate the support of senior administrators at the University, however, the University—\n16  having just had $584 million in funding summarily canceled and having received Defendants’ August 8 \n17  Demand Letter—balked. On August 20, 2025, senior UCLA administrators informed the team that they \n18  would  no  longer  be  endorsing  the  project,  despite  the  significant  support  they  had  previously \n19  demonstrated. The private funder informed the faculty members that the lack of senior administrator \n20  support was disqualifying. Despite months of work to prepare a highly competitive grant application, \n21  the faculty members no longer intend to pursue this project because they have no realistic prospect of \n22  obtaining sufficient funding for it, and team members are concerned about their ability to seek support \n23  from the private funder in the future without the support of UCLA.  \n24  B.  Plaintiffs and Their Members Have Suffered Harm Caused by Defendants. \n25  314.  Plaintiffs’ members have experienced and are continuing to experience significant harms \n26  to their First Amendment rights to free speech and academic freedom because of Defendants’ actions \n27  and credible threats. Defendants’ course of conduct, coupled with UC’s response, has created a climate \n28  of fear that now pervades the teaching, research, and public discourse of Plaintiffs’ members across UC’s \n  - 72 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 81 of 130\n \n \n1  campuses. Plaintiffs’ members’ speech and academic freedom have been chilled in myriad pernicious \n2  ways and will be further chilled and suppressed if UC accedes to the unlawful demands set forth in the \n3  August 8 Demand Letter.  \n4  315.  Plaintiffs’ members have also experienced and are continuing to experience harms to their \n5  financial and professional well-being as a result of Defendants’ unlawful funding cuts and coercive threat \n6  to further withhold still more federal funding from the UC System. Plaintiffs’ members have been \n7  directly and irreparably harmed by the unlawful termination of federal funding for specific projects the \n8  government had previously committed to support. Faculty who are members of AAUP, AFT, UC-AFT, \n9  CUCFA and its affiliated UC Campus FAs have been forced to immediately cease ongoing research, \n10  which results in a cascade of harms not only to the research itself but also to the graduate students (many \n11  of whom are members of UAW and UAW Local 4811), undergraduate students, academic employees, \n12  and staff employees whose financial and professional fates are directly affected by this grant funding.  \n13  316.  Members of all Plaintiffs at UC campuses continue to be harmed by the looming threat \n14  of additional funding cuts. Defendants have so far terminated $584 million from UCLA, but the entire \n15  UC receives approximately $5.7 billion in research funding annually, and another approximately $11.3 \n16  billion in Medicaid, Medicare, and student federal financial aid, all of which could potentially be at stake \n17  if the UC does not accede to Defendants’ coercive demands.  \n18  317.  This  complaint  provides  a  few  examples  of  the  extensive  irreparable  harms  that \n19  Defendants’ conduct as alleged herein has caused and will continue to cause Plaintiffs and their members \n20  unless enjoined. \n \n21 \n(1)  AAUP, AFT, CUCFA, and the UC Campus FAs and Their Members \nHave Been and Will Continue to Be Irreparably Harmed.  \n22 \n318.  Because they fear retaliation by the Trump administration, faculty members of Plaintiffs \n23 \nAAUP, AFT, CUCFA, and the UC FAs have engaged in self-censorship with respect to the development \n24 \nof their curricula, conduct of their research and writing, association with faculty and student groups, and \n25 \nconversations with faculty and students, among other contexts.  \n26 \n319.  For example, the curriculum development and public discourse of various members of \n27 \nfaculty unions and associations have been chilled by the Trump administration’s actions. One member \n28 \n  - 73 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 82 of 130\n \n \n1  of AAUP, AFT, and UCLA FA, for example, is now uncertain whether he will continue to teach an \n2  article addressing an aspect of the Palestinian-American experience in one of his courses. While he \n3  previously offered support to student demonstrations with which he agreed, he now fears lending support \n4  to student action regarding Palestine, lest he be photographed, identified, and subject to retribution by \n5  the federal government. \n6  320.  A member of Davis FA, CUCFA, AAUP, and AFT who teaches history with a focus on \n7  migration in the Middle East was specifically recruited to UC Davis to develop this curriculum. The \n8  federal investigation into alleged actions of antisemitism has created an environment in which she been \n9  publicly called a “terrorist” and threatened with physical violence. Initially, she decided to avoid teaching \n10  any undergraduate classes to try to avoid public attention but recently decided not to teach at all for the \n11  academic year 2025-2026 to try to protect herself. As a result, she is unable to advance her scholarship.   \n12  321.  Similarly, the administration’s actions against UCLA and other universities, and UCB’s \n13  willingness to turn over names to the federal government on the basis of student complaints, has caused \n14  a BFA member concern about addressing the topic of climate change in her class. She has historically \n15  worked with students to analyze evidence and critically evaluate arguments regarding climate change, \n16  and  she  feels  that  doing  so  is  her  responsibility  as  an  instructor  in  her  field.  Because  of  the \n17  administration’s funding cuts to universities and the possibility that even an unsubstantiated complaint \n18  could make her a target of the federal government, she worries that teaching about climate change in a \n19  manner inconsistent with the views of the administration could jeopardize her career, including her \n20  ability to obtain federal grants in the future.  \n21  322.  Another AAUP, AFT, and UCLA FA member who is involved in organizing other faculty \n22  members and students intends to engage in collective action over the coming school year in support of \n23  labor and Palestinian rights, as well as students’ free expression rights. His ability to do so has been and \n24  will be affected by any restrictions on campus speech the University imposes as a result of the federal \n25  government’s threats and demands. \n26  323.  One UCLA professor who is a member of UCLA-FA and AAUP and serves in multiple \n27  departments has observed significantly chilled speech on campus. She and colleagues now devote \n28  substantial time to being hypervigilant about their speech, including reframing the narratives surrounding \n  - 74 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 83 of 130\n \n \n1  their work to avoid any descriptions that might result in targeting by the federal government. She reports \n2  that this self-censorship is impacting the areas of research that she and others in her departments focus \n3  on.   \n4  324.  Suspension of grant funding has also subjected the members of AAUP, AFT, UC-AFT, \n5  the UC Campus FAs, and CUCFA to immediate and irreparable harms that will expand dramatically if \n6  additional grant funding is cut in the future.  \n7  325.  As a result of canceled NSF, NIH, Department of Energy, and other grants, AAUP, AFT, \n8  CUCFA, UCLA FA, UAW Local 4811, and UPTE members report having to cease all work on ongoing \n9  research projects, which, in turn, has already meant delayed project timelines; missed gating points for \n10  scientific research, such as institutional review board meetings; clinical trials and  projects halted \n11  midstream, resulting in untreated patients and the lost value of already-expended research effort; and the \n12  potential for lost human capital as talented and meticulously trained researchers and support staff begin \n13  searching for work elsewhere. If these cessations continue, these members expect they or their labs will \n14  be forced to take even more harmful steps, such as euthanizing lab animals or permanently dismissing \n15  staff.  \n16  326.  AAUP, AFT, CUCFA, UCLA and other campus FAs, UAW Local 4811, and UPTE \n17  members report that, in some cases, if the research projects and clinical trials they work on can no longer \n18  access grant funding, they expect they will soon need to abruptly shut down partnerships with study \n19  participants  and  third-party  collaborators  with  whom  these  members  have  spent  years  carefully \n20  cultivating personal and professional relationships. These abrupt shutdowns would not only devastate \n21  the research they are working on today but also make it more difficult for them to structure future work—\n22  because they would have imperiled trust with program participants, who may suffer significant adverse \n23  health impacts as a result of delays and may be reluctant to trust the University going forward, and \n24  tarnished important relationships with service partners, who will be unwilling to invest in future \n25  collaborative work with UC researchers. \n26  327.  UCLA FA members have seen their federal funding cut, forcing them to abandon or \n27  significantly scale back important research projects and layoff or furlough members of their research \n28  teams. Defendants have suspended all federal grant funding to some departments, like the Department \n  - 75 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 84 of 130\n \n \n1  of Integrative Biology and Physiology, and institutes, like the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics \n2  within the Mathematics Department. UCLA FA members have also observed that Defendants appear to \n3  be targeting training grants for cancellation or suspension, and many members have expressed concern \n4  about continued funding for their students and about the future of their fields. \n5  328.  For example, one UCLA FA, AAUP, and AFT member who is a professor affiliated with \n6  multiple departments has had four NSF grants impacted by suspensions and terminations. Two NSF \n7  grants, supporting work with veterans and interdisciplinary research on water management, were \n8  suspended on August 1, 2025. Although these suspensions were enjoined by a federal court order, the \n9  suspensions have nevertheless subjected this professor and her teams to ongoing harm, including \n10  undermining the hard-won trust of veterans, their families, and community partners who support her \n11  project’s work and difficulty advancing the goals of these projects because of uncertainty about funding \n12  and staffing for the projects going forward.  \n13  329.  Another UCLA professor who is a UCLA FA, AAUP, and AFT member has had two \n14  NIH  grants  suspended.  These  grants  supported  research  on  neurological  disorders  and  career \n15  development, and funded equipment, lab supplies, and the salaries of the members of the research team. \n16  On August 1, 2025, the professor was directed to immediately stop spending on these grant accounts. \n17  These grant suspensions have caused this professor and the research team substantial harm, including \n18  interrupting lines of investigation that were several years in the making, requiring a postdoctoral \n19  researcher who no longer has salary support to shift to an entirely different project, and uncertainty that \n20  is precluding this professor from hiring additional staff to support his research.   \n21  330.  A member of UCLA FA, CUCFA, AAUP, and AFT who runs a neuroscience research \n22  lab has had three-quarters of his funding frozen. His research focuses on basic brain functions, such as \n23  memory. This research is crucial to understanding any neuropsychology condition or neurological decay. \n24  Due to the precarity of funding, he is uncertain whether he will be able to retain anyone who works in \n25  the lab including the researchers who have extremely specialized skills and are not easily replaced. Some \n26  in the lab have already been forced to find other work. As a result of the funding freeze, the member \n27  cannot hire someone to take care of the research animals. Every scientist in his lab now rotates taking \n28  care of the animals, leaving less time for research. The remaining lab staff have slowed down the \n  - 76 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 85 of 130\n \n \n1  animals’ rate of breeding because funding is uncertain, which means that future research will be more \n2  limited. This member is also a co-mentor for a post-doctoral student whose NIH grant has been frozen. \n3  As a result of this freeze, the post-doctoral student reports being unsure whether s/he will be able to \n4  pursue a career in scientific research at all. \n5  331.  A member of UCLA FA, CUCFA, AAUP, and AFT and professor saw her federal \n6  funding suspended recently. Her program is funded by an NIH training grant that funds graduate student \n7  genetics research in psychiatric and neurological brain disorders. At least half the students work with \n8  animal and cell models. Funding suspensions have meant sacrificing the animals, leading to an enormous \n9  and unethical waste in resources. One of the students in the program works as part of a lab that has \n10  recently made breakthroughs in research on Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases using genetically \n11  engineered mice—research that is being hindered by Defendants’ actions. Other students are looking to \n12  taking on Teaching Assistant positions to replace funding, taking away time and energy they could be \n13  using to further their important research. The member is concerned about the future of these research \n14  projects, the labs the students work in, and the training program. \n15  332.  NIH recently suspended two grants to a UCLA FA, CUCFA, AAUP, and AFT member \n16  and professor without any explanation. His research focuses primarily on neurodevelopmental and \n17  neurodegenerative disorders such as epilepsy, seizures and autism, etc. His lab develops brain organoids \n18  using stem cells derived from patients with these disorders and uses these organoids to study brain wave \n19  alterations common in these disorders. As a result of Defendants’ actions, he has had to rely on lab funds \n20  generally reserved for repairing and maintaining research equipment. The precarity of the funding led \n21  the postdoctoral researcher in the lab, who authored prior published papers and was working on another \n22  currently under review, to take a position elsewhere. If funding is not restored in the next several months, \n23  the lab will be shut down. \n24  333.  A UCMFA member conducting federally funded public health research on lesbian, gay, \n25  bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual populations was directed by the federal funding \n26  agency to change all language in the project materials referencing transgender individuals. The federal \n27  agency then cut the funding completely, requiring the member to terminate the entire research project. \n28  Defendants did not offer the member an opportunity to appeal the cancellation. \n  - 77 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 86 of 130\n \n \n1  334.  Another UCMFA member’s federal funding for public health research on physicians in \n2  Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria was cut. While this funding was eventually reinstated, \n3  the member was forced to cease data collection during the suspension period, which set the research \n4  project back a whole year. Defendants have suspended and then reinstated research funding for at least \n5  two other UCMFA members, causing significant disruption to their research projects. \n6  335.  A  SDFA  member  conducted  a  federal-grant-funded  training  in  addressing  partner \n7  violence for early career physicians. Defendants cancelled the grant. The stated reason was that the grant \n8  included the word “equity” in the project title. The member has been forced to terminate the training \n9  program, and the twelve early career physicians who were enrolled in it will most likely not receive this \n10  training. Defendants have also delayed grant funding for a project led by the same member that involved \n11  developing youth-led communication materials to address vaccine hesitancy among Hispanic teenagers. \n12  Continued funding disruptions risk harming or destroying community relationships necessary to conduct \n13  this project that the member spent significant time developing. Funding uncertainty due to Defendants’ \n14  actions has also made it difficult for the member to retain staff and pay staff salaries. \n15  336.  Defendants cancelled a SBFA member’s federal funding for public health research into \n16  racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to harmful chemicals. This member’s research project employed \n17  multiple researchers, including two to three undergraduate student researchers. The member anticipates \n18  terminating those undergraduate student researchers due to the funding cancellation. \n19  337.  Defendants have also cancelled research funding for at least two other SBFA members—\n20  one whose research involved developing tools for under-resourced cultural heritage organizations to \n21  digitize their collections and another whose research involved developing computational methods to \n22  identify misinformation and disinformation involving social science theories. Those members were, in \n23  turn, forced to terminate the employment of five graduate students and two undergraduate student \n24  researchers working on those projects. \n25  338.  Defendants have paused grant funding for another SBFA member’s Airforce and NIH \n26  funded research. Defendants also cancelled an SBFA member’s training program for health workers \n27  supporting racially diverse transgender youth and their families, only to reinstate this funding three \n28  months later. During this three-month funding disruption, the member was forced to stop recruitment \n  - 78 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 87 of 130\n \n \n1  and lost multiple potential participants who had initially expressed interest in taking part in the project. \n2  The member was also forced to spend their personal research funds to support graduate students who \n3  would have otherwise been funded by the suspended grant. \n4  339.  The administration’s demand that the UC cease providing medically necessary care for \n5  minor children suffering from gender dysphoria will also irreparably harm Plaintiffs and their members. \n6  At least one member of the AAUP, AFT and UCLA-FA is a professor and faculty member whose \n7  adolescent child has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. As part of the professor’s benefits as a \n8  faculty member and employee of the UC, the UCLA-FA member has had access to gender-affirming \n9  care to treat his child’s gender dysphoria at UCLA Health. Before the child began treatment for her \n10  gender dysphoria, she experienced serious mental health issues that impacted all aspects of her life. Since \n11  receiving care, her life has dramatically improved and she has benefited extensively from that care. \n12  Terminating this medically necessary care at UC would cause immediate and irreparable harm to this \n13  child and her family, and to other families affected by such a policy. This faculty member’s child has \n14  been prescribed medically necessary hormone medication to treat her gender dysphoria. Without access \n15  to this medication and to her clinicians, the child will be at risk of again experiencing the well-known \n16  and serious effects of untreated gender dysphoria. \n17  340.  Should the administration cut additional federal funds to the UCs, the impacts would be \n18  even more wide-ranging and catastrophic. Faculty across the UC system who are members of AAUP, \n19  AFT, the Campus FAs, and CUCFA would see the funding required to complete research and other \n20  essential work evaporate. \n21  341.  For example, one UCLA professor—who is a member of AAUP, AFT, the UCLA FA, \n22  and a representative from the UCLA FA to CUCFA—was recently notified that the funding associated \n23  with a federal grant for foreign language learning, on-campus area studies programs, and overseas \n24  research that supported her work was no longer available. This professor was no longer able to fund a \n25  visiting expert who was to evaluate her students’ work, and if federal grant funding does not continue, \n26  neither she nor her students will have the financial or logistical support necessary to engage in the \n27  overseas field work that is at the heart of her discipline.   \n28 \n  - 79 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 88 of 130\n \n \n1  342.  AAUP, AFT, CUCFA, and the individual FAs have themselves suffered harms as a result \n2  of Defendants’ course of conduct. \n3  343.  As part of their core organizational activities, the AAUP and AFT regularly consult, work \n4  with,  and  represent  local  chapters  and  individual  members  regarding  academic  freedom,  faculty \n5  governance, and other issues involving the employment relationship between university employees and \n6  their employers, including but not limited to collective bargaining. Through their local chapters, AAUP \n7  and AFT also provide for the representation of individual members regarding academic freedom, shared \n8  governance, and due process issues in proceedings before their university employers. AAUP and AFT \n9  perform these activities on behalf of members at  UC. Investigations of individual complaints of \n10  institutions violating academic freedom principles in relationship to AAUP members are authorized by \n11  the Executive Director and conducted by a subcommittee appointed by the Executive Director. \n12  344.  The AAUP also specifically maintains a standing committee, known as Committee A on \n13  Academic Freedom and Tenure, which “[p]romotes principles of academic freedom, tenure, and due \n14  process in higher education through the development of policy documents and reports relating to these \n15  subjects and the application of those principles to particular situations that are brought to its attention.”  \n16  345.  As another example, in 2024, the AFT launched a multi-year, million-dollar campaign to \n17  support its higher-education chapters in promoting increased public investment in higher education, \n18  safeguarding free speech and academic freedom on campuses, and establishing meaningful job security \n19  for higher-education workers while ending contingent employment for academic workers. As part of this \n20  campaign, the AFT has hosted a series of organizing webinars, providing its higher education members \n21  with the skills they can use to shape and strengthen their own campaigns to support academic freedom, \n22  make higher education more accessible, and ensure contingent faculty have appropriate job security and \n23  a livable wage. \n24  346.  The AFT also administers the AFT Defense Fund, which provides funding to members \n25  for legal proceedings involving, among other subjects, violations of academic freedom, enforcement of \n26  tenure rights, and other threats to job security. \n27  347.  Defendants’ actions have directly impaired these and other activities of Plaintiffs. \n28 \n  - 80 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 89 of 130\n \n \n1  348.  Defendants’ actions have undermined and eroded the longstanding principles of academic \n2  freedom, shared governance, and due process that AAUP and AFT previously helped secure at UC and \n3  other institutions where their members are employed. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, UC and \n4  other universities no longer adhere to these principles. \n5  349.  Defendants’ actions have made it more difficult and resource-intensive for Plaintiffs to \n6  carry out their representation of individual members. Because Defendants have pressured UC and other \n7  universities to abandon their commitment to academic freedom, shared governance, and due process \n8  principles, Plaintiffs must now expend more time and money to ensure that their members’ rights in \n9  these regards are adequately protected. In particular, AFT and AAUP anticipate that they will have to \n10  make significantly more expenditures from their respective Defense Funds to provide for the legal \n11  representation of individual members as a direct result of Defendants’ actions and UC’s potential \n12  capitulation to Defendants’ demands.  \n13  350.  Defendants’ actions have also made it more difficult and resource-intensive for Plaintiffs \n14  to provide accurate and effective guidance to their chapters and members regarding these principles. \n15  Plaintiffs have had to divert staff and financial resources to address the significant influx of inquiries \n16  from chapter leaders and members regarding the effect of such actions on members’ academic freedom, \n17  shared governance, and due process rights, and to ensure that individual members are adequately \n18  represented before their university employers. In addition to responding to such individual requests, staff \n19  for Plaintiffs have had to conduct nationwide calls and virtual meetings with chapter leaders regarding \n20  Defendants’ actions and how to represent individual members in the face of such actions. The AAUP \n21  has sent staff who would otherwise be performing other duties to UCLA to support the UCLA FA. And \n22  AAUP leadership has diverted a great deal of time and resources to supporting faculty across the UCs \n23  who are facing the various challenges posed by Defendants’ threats and funding cuts, and the UC’s \n24  actions in response to those threats and funding cuts. \n25  351.  Defendants’ actions have also caused a pervasive sense of fear and intimidation among \n26  AAUP and AFT’s members. Because of Defendants’ actions and the threats of further cuts to research \n27  and other federal funding, some AAUP/AFT members no longer feel comfortable participating in and \n28 \n  - 81 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 90 of 130\n \n \n1  supporting the AAUP’s activities, or asserting their academic freedom, shared governance, and due \n2  process rights. \n3  352.  CUCFA and all the affiliated campus-based FAs have been forced to devote much of their \n4  scarce resources to advocating for their members’ continued federal funding and the opportunity to \n5  continue members’ research in an unrestricted fashion consistent with scientific norms and academic \n6  freedom. This has included helping faculty navigate the obscure internal procedures implicated in \n7  Defendants’ attacks on protected political speech, pressing UC administrators for transparency about the \n8  scope of federal funding reductions, and advising colleagues on ways to recover lost federal resources \n9  and  mitigate  their  impact  on  FA  members’  own  salaries  and  research  and  on  their  postdoctoral \n10  researchers and graduate student workers. This has prevented the CUCFA and FAs from being able to \n11  devote the necessary resources to serving their core mission of advocating with the UC for improvements \n12  to the working conditions of their members. Some FAs also report struggling to recruit and expand their \n13  membership because of a concern by some faculty that joining could cause them or their research to be \n14  targeted. Some FAs have felt compelled to chill their own speech in order to protect their members and \n15  their campus. For example, one FA reports avoiding discussion of Palestine in communications with \n16  members despite interest in the issue among the members and faculty. \n \n17 \n(2)  AFSCME and Its Members Have Been and Will Continue to Be \nIrreparably Harmed.  \n18 \n353.  In  negotiations  with  AFSCME  over  AFSCME  members’  terms  and  conditions  of \n19 \nemployment, the UC has cited federal funding cuts and federal demands for financial penalties as reasons \n20 \nto demand concessions from AFSCME and its members, including staffing cuts. For example, on March \n21 \n19, 2025, the UC announced a systemwide hiring freeze. The UC’s stated reason for the freeze was to \n22 \nprepare for federal cuts to “lifesaving research, patient care, and education support.”201 As a result of \n23 \nthis  freeze,  the  UC  has  not  hired  new  people  into  AFSCME-represented  positions,  diminishing \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n201 Michael V.

Drake on the University of \n27 \nCalifornia’s financial outlook, UC News (Mar. 19, 2025), \n28  https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/employee-news/president-drake-on-the-university-of-\ncalifornia-financial-outlook/. \n  - 82 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 91 of 130\n \n \n1  AFSCME’s membership and burdening AFSCME’s existing members by depriving them of the staffing \n2  they need in their work.   \n3  354.  In June 2025, the UC announced mass layoffs of AFSCME patient care technical worker \n4  members from UCSD Health and UCSF Health, citing a lack of funds. UCSF told AFSCME that layoffs \n5  and involuntary reductions in time were the “result of a loss of federal grant funding.” \n6  355.  On  or  about  August  1,  2025,  the  UC  advised  AFSCME  that  due  to  the  federal \n7  government’s suspension of research funding to UCLA, the UC would be “assessing potential impacts \n8  on University operations, including potential employment impacts,” meaning layoffs and/ or other \n9  takeaways from AFSCME members.   \n10  356.  The collective bargaining agreements between AFSCME and the UC expired by their \n11  own terms on July 21, 2024 and the parties have been in negotiations for more than sixteen months. The \n12  cuts to federal funding and threats of future cuts have contributed to a paralysis in negotiations. This has \n13  required AFSCME’s members to continue to work without a contract and required AFSCME to continue \n14  to spend the majority of its staff time and considerable resources—several tens of thousands of dollars—\n15  on its campaign to insist that the University bargain with the Union in good faith and reach a fair \n16  agreement.       \n17  357.  Defendants’  actions  and  threats  have  also  caused  a  pervasive  sense  of  fear  and \n18  intimidation among many of AFSCME’s members. For example, more than 40 percent of AFSCME’s \n19  members are Latino and a substantial number are immigrants, many of whom are living in acute fear \n20  that they or their family members will be rounded up and detained (or worse) by ICE. These fears arise \n21  in the context of widespread reports that ICE has harassed and/or detained Latino people who are U.S. \n22  citizens or are otherwise authorized to be in the United States, simply on the basis of their perceived race \n23  or ethnicity.   \n24  358.  On June 24, 2025, ICE agents entered the Emergency Department of Ronald Reagan \n25  UCLA Medical Center where AFSCME members work in a variety of roles such as ER Techs, nurse \n26  assistants, admissions and janitorial services.202 Armed ICE agents wearing military-style clothes with \n \n27 \n202 Clara Harter and Jaweed Kaleem, ICE agents entered UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. It \n28  wasn’t a raid, officials say., L.A.

A van of three to four more agents waited parked outside the main doors where patients \n3  enter and exit. The impact on the workplace and healthcare services was immediate and damaging. Staff \n4  feared for their own safety and the safety of patients and co-workers and impeded in their ability to \n5  perform their jobs providing frontline assistance to emergency room patients.      \n6  359.  The adverse impact did not end when ICE left. Some AFSCME members feared going to \n7  work in the days after. In addition, on information and belief, some AFSCME members and members of \n8  the public were afraid to seek healthcare because of the risk of encountering masked, armed ICE agents \n9  again.203    \n10  360.  On or about August 6, 2025, the UC announced a pending new policy that expands ICE’s \n11  access to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center, Orthopedic \n12  Hospital, and Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA, and UCLA West Valley Medical Center and \n13  limits workers’ ability to enforce their rights and protect the rights of patients. Despite California law \n14  requirements to do so, the revised policy does not require federal agents to produce a warrant or court \n15  order or consistently demonstrate that they have legal custody of a detained patient before they may enter \n16  patient care areas of the facility. Nor does the policy require administrators to insist that ICE officers \n17  identify themselves, remove their masks, or defer to the clinical decisions of health care providers.  \n18  361.  On information and belief, the UC changed this policy as a result of threats to withdraw \n19  federal funding if UCLA did not facilitate cooperation with ICE.   \n20  362.  As a result of Defendants’ threats, some AFSCME members  have been concerned about \n21  going to work or about receiving medical care at UCLA medical facilities. These actions have required \n22  AFSCME to spend resources counseling members about immigration-related issues and educating them \n23  about their legal rights.    \n24  363.  AFSCME also has members who identify as transgender. These members work at \n25  multiple UC locations, including at UCLA. AFSCME and its membership have fought for and won \n26  protections for all members from discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and \n \n27 \nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-24/ice-agents-enter-ucla-medical-center-to-seek-\n28  emergency-care-for-detainee. \n203 Id. \n  - 84 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 93 of 130\n \n \n1  gender expression, among other categories. AFSCME’s transgender members would be substantially \n2  harmed if in response to the federal demands and threats the UC imposed new restrictions on transgender \n3  employees, such as restrictions on bathroom access or if the UC imposed policies defining “sex” or \n4  “gender”  in  ways  that  deny  transgender  members’  identity.  In  addition  to  working  for  the  UC, \n5  AFSCME’s members and their families are consumers and patients of UC healthcare services. The UC \n6  encourages AFSCME members to participate in UC-affiliated healthcare benefit plans and more than \n7  10,000 of AFSCME’s members have access to UC healthcare as part of their employee benefits. \n8  Eliminating access to necessary medical care at UC medical centers such as access to gender-affirming \n9  care for minors would harm AFSCME members who need or may need such care for their families and \n10  would substantially degrade the quality of their healthcare benefit. On information and belief, AFSCME \n11  has members with minor children who require gender affirming care.  \n \n12 \n(3)  UPTE-CWA and Its Members Have Been and Will Continue to Be \nIrreparably Harmed.  \n13 \n364.  The UC has cited threats of federal funding cuts and federal demands as reasons to \n14 \ndemand concessions from UPTE and its members, including staffing cuts. UC laid off UPTE members \n15 \nat UCSF Health including workers who held critical roles that directly provided and supported patient \n16 \ncare, such as rehab specialists, clinical laboratory scientists and physical therapists. The UC pointed to \n17 \n“serious financial challenges” as its justification for the layoffs, which was understood to include federal \n18 \nfunding cuts.204 The UC also laid off UPTE members at UC San Diego, including approximately sixteen \n19 \ncareer animal technicians who perform critical work for ongoing research studies aimed at battling \n20 \nserious diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s. The UC claimed that “mounting financial pressures caused \n21 \nby federal impacts on health care” was a reason for the layoffs.205  \n22 \n365.  The collective bargaining agreements between UPTE and the UC expired by their own \n23 \nterms on September 30, 2024 (for healthcare professionals) and on October 31, 2024 (for technical \n24 \n25   \n204 Madilynne Medina, ‘Heartless’ mass firings at major Bay Area health care network spark \n26 \npushback, SFGATE (July 8, 2025), https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/heartless-firings-bay-area-\nhealth-care-network-20761887.php. \n27 \n205 Eric S.

The parties have been in negotiations for more than a year. \n2  The cuts to federal funding and threats of future cuts have contributed to a paralysis in negotiations, \n3  which has required UPTE’s members to continue to work without a contract and required UPTE to \n4  continue to spend the majority of its staff time and considerable resources—several tens of thousands of \n5  dollars—on its campaign to insist that the University bargain with the Union in good faith and reach a \n6  fair agreement.       \n7  366.  Defendants’  actions  and  threats  have  also  caused  a  pervasive  sense  of  fear  and \n8  intimidation among many of UPTE’s members and have chilled UPTE members in the exercise of their \n9  First Amendment rights. For example, UPTE has many members whose jobs are funded by federal \n10  grants, including members who are personally named in those grants. One such member works under a \n11  federal grant that funds a long-term study on children’s health. In the spring of 2025, several years into \n12  the grant, the federal agency required a reduction in the budget to remove so-called “diversity, equity \n13  and inclusion” components of the project. The federal agency required the project to eliminate one of \n14  the aims of the study that included the word “equity” in the description and required the project to \n15  terminate its association with a trusted community organization that had a word disfavored by the Trump \n16  administration in its name. The organization was one of the grant’s original principal investigators and \n17  provided valuable support for the project, including for the work of the UPTE member specifically. The \n18  threatened cut in grant funding placed the UPTE member at potential risk of layoff. Through a federal \n19  court injunction in the Thakur case, the conditions on federal funding were subsequently lifted, but the \n20  UPTE member remains worried that the funding will be lost if the project were to continue as originally \n21  planned and maintain its association with the community organization.  \n22  367.  The risk of future cuts has led the UPTE member and her colleagues to self-censor in the \n23  hope that by doing so, their project will stay out of the federal agency’s crosshairs. For example, the \n24  UPTE member now avoids talking to the press about the project’s work despite the help that media \n25  coverage could provide the project in recruiting participants and despite public interest in the subject of \n26  the grant. The UPTE member and her colleagues have also removed from their public-facing documents \n27  words or expressions known to be disfavored by the Trump administration (e.g., “equity,” “race,” \n28 \n  - 86 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 95 of 130\n \n \n1  “justice,” “diversity,” “transgender”) and citations to anything including those words and are censoring \n2  themselves from using such terms publicly for fear the funding will be cut.  \n3  368.   Another UPTE member is a staff research associate whose career and future as a \n4  scientific researcher has been jeopardized. She has worked in research at UC for more than a decade and \n5  was recently hired for a project that seeks to help diagnose and cure genetic mutations in newborns. \n6  However, the federal government has frozen the project’s funding and the UPTE member does not know \n7  whether she will be able to keep her job and perform this valuable work. Her professional future is \n8  uncertain and for the first time in over a decade, she is having to look outside of UC for work. Her job \n9  search has shown her that the job market is extremely competitive right now because numerous people \n10  are in similar situations to her. Despite her qualifications, she is facing the prospect of not being able to \n11  advance her career as she had hoped and potentially having to leave scientific research altogether. \n12  369.  UPTE also has members who are transgender. These members work at multiple UC \n13  locations, including at UCLA. UPTE and its membership have fought for and won protections for all \n14  members from discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression. \n15  UPTE’s transgender members would be substantially harmed if the UC imposed new restrictions on \n16  transgender employees, such as restrictions on bathroom access or if the UC imposed policies defining \n17  “sex” or “gender” in ways that deny transgender members’ identity.    \n18  370.  In addition to working for the UC, many UPTE’s members and their families are \n19  consumers and patients of UC healthcare services. The UC encourages UPTE members to participate in \n20  UC-affiliated healthcare benefit plans and the vast majority of UPTE’s members have access to UC \n21  healthcare as part of their employee benefits. Restrictions on access to necessary medical care at UC \n22  medical centers such as access to gender-affirming care for minors would harm UPTE members who \n23  need or may need such care for their families and would substantially degrade the quality of their \n24  healthcare benefit. On information and belief, UPTE has members with minor children who require \n25  gender affirming care.  \n \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  - 87 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 96 of 130\n \n \n(4)  UC-AFT  and  Its  Members  Have  Been  and  Will  Continue  to  Be \n1 \nIrreparably Harmed. \n2 \n371.  UC-AFT members’ jobs, privacy, free speech rights, and academic freedom have been \n3 \nand will continue to be harmed. More than 200 UC-AFT represented lecturers and librarians have been \n4 \nlaid off or faced reductions in time and the University has justified these actions as a direct or indirect \n5 \nresult of federal funding cuts. Some layoff notices from the University to UC-AFT members have \n6 \nexpressly cited federal funding cuts as a cause. \n7 \n372.  Defendants’ threats and actions have also generated a pervasive sense of fear and \n8 \nintimidation among UC-AFT members. UC-AFT member lecturers fear teaching material in their field \n9 \nif it touches on subjects perceived to be disfavored by Defendants and have at times declined to teach \n10 \nsuch material because of a concern that Defendants would use the material to further threaten the \n11 \nUniversity with sanctions and funding cuts. This fear is reasonable given the cuts the University \n12 \ncommunity has already seen, especially to grants related to subjects that the Trump administration \n13 \ndisfavors.  \n14 \n373.  For example, a UC-AFT member and lecturer at UCLA reports substantial fears among \n15 \nher colleagues who teach courses in ethnic studies. They have considered whether they need to change \n16 \ntheir course syllabi to avoid cuts to their department or school. \n17 \n374.  Another UC-AFT member and lecturer, on information and belief, removed a unit in his \n18 \nclass because it contained material that offered a critique of a portion of the U.S. economy. The lecturer \n19 \nfeared that teaching the material could cause the lecturer or department to be targeted by the federal \n20 \ngovernment. \n21 \n375.  News that on or about September 4, 2025, UC Berkeley turned over 160 names of \n22 \nstudents, faculty and staff to the federal government in connection with the antisemitism investigation \n23 \nhas exacerbated UC-AFT members’ fears and increased the chilling of the members’ speech and \n24 \nacademic freedom. The 160 names included at least one UC-AFT member. \n25 \n376.  UC-AFT members at UC Berkeley report being afraid to attend any protest or rally out \n26 \nof concern that they will end up on a “list” and have their names and contact information divulged to the \n27 \nfederal government and suffer an as-yet unspecified harm as a result. Some members even report being \n28 \nfearful about being on campus.   \n  - 88 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 97 of 130\n \n \n1  377.  Defendants’ demand that UC cease providing certain types of healthcare threatens serious \n2  harm to UC-AFT members. UC-AFT members and their families are consumers and patients of UC’s \n3  healthcare services and medical systems. Defendants’ demand that UC eliminate gender affirming care \n4  for minors at UC medical centers would seriously degrade the healthcare benefits UC-AFT members \n5  and their dependents receive and potentially place the health of UC-AFT members’ minor children at \n6  risk. For example, UC-AFT has at least one member whose child received gender affirming care from \n7  UCLA Medical Center as a minor. Had UC medical center categorically refused to provide such care \n8  when this family needed it, this child could have suffered serious ongoing health effects.    \n9  378.  UC-AFT also has members who are transgender themselves. UC-AFT’s transgender \n10  members would be substantially harmed if in response to the federal demands and threats the University \n11  imposed new restrictions on transgender employees, such as if the University imposed policies defining \n12  “sex” or “gender” in ways that deny transgender members’ identity or restricts access to restrooms. \n \n13 \n(5)  AFSCME,  UPTE,  UC-AFT,  UC  Santa  Cruz  Faculty  Association, \nUAW, and UAW Local 4811 and Their Members Have Been and Will \n14 \nContinue to Be Irreparably Harmed \n15 \n379.  Plaintiffs AFSCME, UPTE, UC-AFT, UC Santa Cruz Faculty Association, UAW, and \n16 \nUAW Local 4811 are labor unions under California with the exclusive legal right to bargain with the UC \n17 \non behalf of their members over their terms and conditions of employment. This includes the right to \n18 \nbargain with the UC over access to the UC’s property to communicate with UC employees the union \n19 \nrepresents,  distribute  literature,  investigate  workplace  conditions,  assess  contractual  and  statutory \n20 \ncompliance, and voice the union’s and its members concerns about working conditions. This also \n21 \nincludes the right to bargain over time, place, and manner speech restrictions, and the location of union \n22 \nprotests. These rights are not the University’s to give away. Yet the administration’s demands that the \n23 \nUC unilaterally impose new restrictions on access and protest activity would deny these unions their \n24 \nrights to negotiate such matters directly with UC.  \n25 \n380.  Plaintiffs AFSCME Local 3299, UPTE, UC-AFT, UC Santa Cruz Faculty Association, \n26 \nUAW, and UAW Local 4811 would also be irreparably harmed if in response to the federal demands \n27 \nand threats, the University imposed policies defining “sex” or “gender” in ways that deny transgender \n28 \nmembers’ identity and make them unwelcome in the workplace as would the imposition of new \n  - 89 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 98 of 130\n \n \n1  restrictions on transgender employees, such as restrictions on restroom access. These policies are \n2  contrary to these unions’ missions to improve the working conditions of their respective members, and \n3  contrary to contractual language the unions have negotiated to prohibit discrimination based on gender \n4  identity. The unions have spent resources to win protections for transgender members in bargaining \n5  which protections could be eviscerated if the UC gave in to the federal demands and threats. \n \n6 \n(6)  CNA/NNU  and  CIR  and  Their  Members  Have  Been  and  Will \nContinue to Be Irreparably Harmed. \n7 \n381.  Plaintiffs CNA/NNU and CIR are labor unions with the exclusive legal right to bargain \n8 \nwith the UC on behalf of their members over their terms and conditions of employment, including the \n9 \nright to bargain over access to the UC’s property to communicate with UC employees the union \n10 \nrepresents,  distribute  literature,  investigate  workplace  conditions,  assess  contractual  and  statutory \n11 \ncompliance, and voice the union’s and its members’ concerns about working conditions; over time, \n12 \nplace, and manner speech restrictions; and over the location of union protests. The administration’s \n13 \ndemands that the UC unilaterally impose new restrictions on access and protest activity would deny these \n14 \nunions their rights to negotiate such matters directly with UC.  \n15 \n382.  CNA/NNU’s RN members have a professional duty to provide the highest level of care \n16 \nto all patients, using evidence-based scientific knowledge. The elimination of diversity, equity, and \n17 \ninclusion within the UC system will interfere with RNs’ professional duties. Such programs in healthcare \n18 \nsettings are necessary to ensure that racial bias does not interfere with the delivery of appropriate medical \n19 \ncare. Implicit biases have resulted in, e.g., disparate maternal mortality rates along race lines, and \n20 \npervasive unscientific beliefs about pain tolerance in non-white patients. These negative health outcomes \n21 \ncan be addressed by education about implicit biases, and prioritizing diversity in medical school \n22 \nadmissions and hiring of healthcare workers.  \n23 \n383.  Toward this end, CNA/NNU and UC have negotiated the formation of a joint labor \n24 \nmanagement committee on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The committee is tasked with carrying out \n25 \neducation, training, and other steps toward addressing racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes \n26 \nand to promote and improve the delivery of culturally sensitive health care. If all such programs are \n27 \neliminated as a result of the Trump administration’s threats, CNA/NNU will lose this negotiated benefit. \n28 \n  - 90 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 99 of 130\n \n \n1  CNA/NNU will no longer be able to rely on UC to be a partner in these programs that are critical to its \n2  members’ professional duties, and CNA will need to increase the resources that it expends on these \n3  programs. \n4  384.  Defendants’ coercive threats to the UC frustrate Plaintiff CIR’s mission both in \n5  bargaining and in representing and protecting its members. CIR has a long-standing history of \n6  supporting health justice for all and free expression on issues of public importance, and members, \n7  including those employed by the UC, have organized around a variety of issues related to the \n8  healthcare system and public health, including raising standards for medical education, improving \n9  resident well-being, ensuring patient and worker safety, and fighting for access to quality healthcare \n10  for all. CIR regularly works to protect the free speech rights, bargaining rights and economic interests \n11  of its members, in addition to its members’ rights to a safe and non-discriminatory workplace. \n12  385.  CIR is currently engaged in system-wide negotiations with the UC for a collective \n13  bargaining agreement covering all the approximately 6,600 resident physician employees across the \n14  UC. This is the first time CIR has negotiated with the UC since combining all its campus-specific \n15  bargaining units into a single, system-wide unit, and the negotiations demand a significant amount of \n16  the Union’s staff time and financial resources. UC’s lead negotiator has referenced federal funding cuts \n17  in initial bargaining sessions, and CIR expects the UC to continue to refer to such cuts, and/or any \n18  impact of future settlement payments to the Trump administration, throughout bargaining as a \n19  justification for any inordinately low economic bargaining proposals. \n20  386.  CIR has already been forced to divert staff and financial resources from its current \n21  bargaining work to address increased inquiries from members regarding the effect of the Trump \n22  administration’s actions and demands on funding, free expression, gender-affirming care, transgender \n23  rights, and immigration enforcement. For example, CIR members have reported and requested the \n24  Union’s support related to: (1) the UC, on or around the start of the new academic year on July 1, \n25  2025, enforcing policies that bar the wearing of “political” pins and buttons in the workplace, \n26  including Union-branded pins, which had previously not been enforced; (2) threats and rumors about \n27  the UC being forced to stop providing gender-affirming care to patients; (3) the UC’s policies \n28  regarding cooperation with ICE agents and other law enforcement agencies, including the August 2025 \n  - 91 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 100 of 130\n \n \n1  UCLA policy changes regarding ICE access to UCLA hospitals and clinics in which CIR members \n2  work, and the impact of such policies on the safety and well-being of members as well as their \n3  patients; (4) increased fear of speaking out with views contrary to the Trump administration, including \n4  but not limited to ICE presence at hospitals and clinics, Palestine, and gender-affirming care; (5) the \n5  UC making various changes to working terms and conditions since the start of the 2025 Academic \n6  Year on July 1, 2025, including but not limited to cuts to conference funding, departmental allowances, \n7  and late night meals, citing new budget constraints in the face of federal funding cuts; (6) the UC \n8  unilaterally enacting new time, place, and manner speech restrictions at all CIR member worksites; and \n9  (7) the UC’s sharing of member names and contact information with the Trump administration in \n10  response to a March 2025 subpoena from the EEOC related to an investigation into antisemitism \n11  allegations on UC campuses, which, on information and belief, requested the personal contact and \n12  demographic information for approximately 860 UC faculty, other academic appointees, and staff \n13  (including CIR members). CIR has demanded to bargain over the effects of this decision to share \n14  member information and has made proposals as part of its system-wide negotiations over the issue of \n15  future disclosure of CIR member information to third parties. \n16  387.  CIR members have engaged in self-censorship with respect to speaking publicly on \n17  important topics that have been identified by the Trump administration as not aligned with the current \n18  federal government. For example, a member who has previously spoken out about Palestine now fears \n19  that, because of the Trump administration’s threats to the UC and allegations of antisemitism, that her \n20  viewpoint will put her and her employer at risk. Because of her understanding that her viewpoint is \n21  disfavored by the Trump administration, she has self-censored and spoken out less frequently. Another \n22  member, who has previously spoken about best practices for providing care to transgender patients, \n23  intends to avoid speaking on the same topic because the threats from the Trump administration put \n24  them, their employer, and their career at risk. \n25  388.  CIR members have also been impacted by the presence of ICE at UC hospitals and \n26  clinics, and any further commitment by the UC to cooperate with law enforcement would harm CIR \n27  members’ ability to meet the professional and ethical standards of their profession. ICE’s presence at \n28  the UC hospitals and clinics interferes with CIR members’ ability as physicians to have confidential \n  - 92 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 101 of 130\n \n \n1  communications with patients. Patients are unable to speak candidly about their history and needs in \n2  front of federal agents and, if UC commits to cooperating with federal law enforcement, it will further \n3  erode the trust necessary to the patient-provider relationship. Multiple members report that ICE’s \n4  presence and a commitment by the UC to cooperate with law enforcement would interfere with the \n5  physicians’ ability to collect thorough, treatment-critical history from a patient or a patient’s family \n6  members in situations in which a patient may not be able to speak on their own behalf. Family \n7  members may not feel safe sharing information or even coming to the hospital to be present with their \n8  loved one, if they know ICE may be present. Without the ability to collect accurate history or \n9  confidential information, CIR members fear that their medical judgment would be negatively \n10  impacted.   \n11  389.  CIR has language in its collective bargaining agreements that guarantees its members a \n12  non-discriminatory workplace, including one that does not discriminate based on a person’s sex, sexual \n13  orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Those protections would be eroded if the UC were \n14  to agree to the settlement terms that are purportedly being demanded by the Trump administration. In \n15  particular, CIR has members who are transgender and members who are non-binary, who would suffer \n16  irreparable dignitary harms if, in response to the federal demands and threats, the UC imposed new \n17  restrictions on transgender employees, such as restrictions on bathroom access or definitions of “sex” \n18  or “gender” that deny members’ existence and identity.  \n19  390.  CIR’s transgender and non-binary members who receive healthcare at UC hospitals and \n20  clinics would also suffer irreparable harm to the quality of their healthcare benefit if their providers \n21  were to reject the existence of transgender and non-binary identities. One member stated that receiving \n22  care from providers who were not allowed to acknowledge their identity would undermine any care \n23  directly related to gender identity and would make them imminently less likely to maintain continued \n24  care for other conditions. \n25  391.  Further, CIR’s resident physician members themselves provide gender-affirming care to \n26  transgender and gender-diverse patients, including transgender minors, at UC hospitals and clinics, and \n27  under the instruction and supervision of the UC. Providing such care is life-affirming and life-saving, \n28  and CIR members view the provision of such care as part of their duty of care owed to their patients. If \n  - 93 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 102 of 130\n \n \n1  the UC agrees to the Trump administration’s demand to cease providing this care to minors, CIR \n2  members will be irreparably harmed, because they will no longer be able to act on their ethical and \n3  medical judgment. Proper treatment and evidence-based care is proven to improve the mental health \n4  and well-being of transgender people and increase their trust in the medical profession in a way that \n5  encourages them to access medical care more generally. If CIR members became unable to provide \n6  gender-affirming care to minors because of UC’s acquiescence to the Trump administration’s \n7  demands, there would be immediate and long-term harms to the patients and to CIR members’ ability \n8  to practice their professions and meet their ethical and professional obligations. \n \n9 \n(7)  UAW  and  UAW  4811  and Their  Members Have  Been  and  Will \nContinue to Be Irreparably Harmed.  \n10 \n392.  Plaintiffs  UAW  and  Local  4811,  as  part  of  being  the  joint  collective  bargaining \n11 \nrepresentatives for 48,000 employees at the University of California, advocate for members’ job security, \n12 \nfair wages, academic freedom, and safe working conditions, including protections from bullying, \n13 \nharassment, and discrimination. In addition, UAW and Local 4811 have a long-standing history at the \n14 \nUC of supporting the expansion of civil and workers’ rights including non-discrimination protections, \n15 \nas well as increased federal funding for scientific research, due to its importance for innovation, \n16 \neconomic growth, and public health. \n17 \n393.  Defendants’ actions have directly impaired these and other central activities of UAW and \n18 \nLocal 4811. UAW and Local 4811 have been forced to spend significant time and resources responding \n19 \nto the fallout from Defendants’ actions, including counseling members who anticipate loss of jobs or \n20 \nfunding  and  connecting  members  with  outside  resources,  instead  of  doing  the  representational, \n21 \norganizing, and advocacy work that is its core mission. Notably, UAW and Local 4811 are currently in \n22 \nthe midst of negotiations with the UC for a new collective bargaining agreement covering 36,000 \n23 \nacademic student employees. UAW is also bargaining and preparing to bargain first contracts for two \n24 \nnew bargaining units covering 15,000 professional staff employees at the UC. UAW and Local 4811 \n25 \nhave had to divert their staff and their financial resources from these core activities to address the \n26 \nsignificant influx of inquiries from members regarding the effect of the administration’s actions on \n27 \nresearch funding, academic freedom, and due process rights. \n28 \n  - 94 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 103 of 130\n \n \n1  394.  UAW Local 4811 members have been and will be directly harmed by the current funding \n2  freezes, terminations, and potential additional cuts. Federal grants represent the principal funding source \n3  for UAW Local 4811 members in non-student academic employee positions such as postdoctoral \n4  scholar, researcher, and project scientist. The scientists in these positions rely on outside grant funding \n5  in order to maintain their research and employment at UC, and this funding largely comes from the \n6  federal government. Researchers and project scientists are also often named as a Principal Investigator \n7  on federal grants. The suspension of federal grants on or about July 30, 2025 resulted in immediate \n8  suspension of numerous research projects conducted by UAW Local 4811 members. These employees \n9  have  had  to  redirect  their  time  away  from  critical,  time-sensitive  research  to  instead  search  for \n10  replacement funding. Without replacement funding, these employees risk losing their positions at UC. \n11  Even if replacement funds are located, no other funding can replace the academic prestige that federal \n12  funding grants confer on the recipient scientist.  \n13  395.  Federal grants are also a significant source of funding for UAW Local 4811 members \n14  who are graduate student researchers at UC. A graduate student researcher position is a salaried \n15  employment position that UC graduate students rely on as their source of income to pay rent and living \n16  expenses. Student employees with graduate student researcher positions at a 25 percent appointment or \n17  above also have their tuition reimbursed by UC. The loss of federal grants means that the affected UC \n18  laboratories will lose their ability to hire graduate student researchers, resulting in many UAW 4811 \n19  members losing both their employment, as well as their eligibility for tuition reimbursement. Cutting \n20  federal grants will also interrupt the thesis and dissertation research UAW 4811 members are completing \n21  thus slowing the timeline to degree completion and causing some members to reconsider their projects \n22  or even drop out of their programs. \n23  396.  UAW Local 4811 members employed at UC have also curtailed their public speech out \n24  of fear of having research grants cancelled. This includes some members decreasing their use of social \n25  media to post their views on current political topics, as well as other members deciding not to travel to \n26  and speak at  research conferences they previously attended in order to publicize their work and \n27  collaborate with other scientists. \n28 \n  - 95 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 104 of 130\n \n \n1  397.  A UAW Local 4811 member who is an associate project scientist in the Department of \n2  Pediatrics of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA reports that their NIH research grant \n3  funding was suspended on July 30, 2025. The research project involved developing specific T cells to \n4  target solid cancers. The project had four UC employees who drew their salaries from that funding grant \n5  before it was suspended, the member as well as a postdoctoral scholar and two staff research associates. \n6  The suspension has effectively halted new development of the project, including proposed animal model \n7  experiments. Due to other grants the four employees remain employed for now, but if funds remain \n8  frozen there will have to be layoffs, and the supervising Faculty member might depart for another \n9  university, resulting in the whole laboratory where this research project resides being shut down. \n10  398.  Another UAW Local 4811 member who is an Assistant Project Scientist II in the Division \n11  of Cardiology of the School of Medicine at UCLA had his grant funding suspended. The suspended NIH \n12  grant, for which this member was the Principal Investigator, was a K99/R00 MOSAIC award to \n13  investigate wildfire smoke toxicology and effects on atherosclerosis, which is a type of cardiovascular \n14  disease. The grant termination has caused the suspension of the research project and the member’s salary \n15  being reduced by 50%. The member has had to devote his time to finding new funding sources to support \n16  his salary and research. The participation of two undergraduate student research volunteers, who \n17  previously assisted on the project but were not financially supported by it, has ceased, causing them to \n18  lose invaluable experience and training. \n19  399.  A UAW Local 4811 member who is a graduate student researcher in the Division of \n20  Pulmonary and Critical Care of the School of Medicine at UCLA reports that his research supported by \n21  an NIH grant was frozen on or about July 31, 2025. Under the supervision of a Principal Investigator, \n22  his research focuses on sex differences in lung cancer prevention, with an emphasis on metabolism, \n23  epigenetics, and tumor progression, and he previously received assistance from five undergraduate \n24  researchers and one project scientist. The grant freeze has forced the graduate student researcher to pause \n25  in vivo experiments, which are essential to studying sex differences in lung cancer. As a result, the \n26  laboratory’s capacity has been significantly reduced; four of the five undergraduates have left the \n27  laboratory, and the project scientist’s position has been terminated. This has directly stalled progress on \n28 \n  - 96 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 105 of 130\n \n \n1  his research project, limited his training opportunities as a graduate student, which could harm his future \n2  career prospects. \n3  (8)  Teamsters Local 2010 and Its Members Have Been and Will Continue \nto Be Irreparably Harmed. \n4 \n400.  The Trump administration’s federal funding cuts have harmed Teamsters Local 2010 and \n5 \nits members, and the administration’s ongoing course of conduct threatens further harm. The University \n6 \nof California instituted a hiring freeze that has reduced the membership of Teamsters Local 2010 and \n7 \noverburdened current members. It has laid off Teamsters Local 2010 members and has threatened \n8 \nadditional layoffs due to losses of federal funding. The University has threatened to lay off a large \n9 \nnumber of Teamsters Local 10-represented positions at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, \n10 \nwhich will damage Teamsters Local 2010’s members and decimate critical research and development in \n11 \nNational defense.  \n12 \n401.  Teamsters  Local  2010  is  scheduled  to  begin  collective  bargaining  negotiations  in \n13 \nSeptember 2025 for its largest bargaining unit comprising over 18,000 employees. The collective \n14 \nbargaining negotiations and the ability of Teamsters Local 2010 to win needed cost-of-living increases \n15 \nfor its members will be severely hampered by these funding cuts.  \n16 \n402.  Due to the Defendants’ statements and actions concerning UC, Teamsters Local 2010 \n17 \nmembers have expressed fear in participating in protests or taking collective action or posting on social \n18 \nmedia. Teamsters Local 2010 members have engaged in self-censorship in what they wear and say. \n19 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n20 \nCOUNT I \n21 \n \n22  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nViolation of First Amendment Freedom of Speech  \n23  (Unconstitutional Coercion; Retaliation; Content and Viewpoint Discrimination) \n(Against All Defendants) \n24 \n403.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n25 \n404.  The First Amendment secures Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ members’ right to free speech \n26 \nand academic freedom, including the right to pursue research and express different viewpoints and \n27 \npolitical beliefs without retaliation, punishment, or deterrence based on the subject matter of that research \n28 \nor those viewpoints and beliefs.  \n  - 97 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 106 of 130\n \n \n1  405.  “[A]cademic freedom ... is of transcendent value to all of us and ... is therefore a special \n2  concern of the First Amendment.” Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, \n3  603 (1967); accord Demers v. Austin, 746 F.3d 402, 411 (9th Cir. 2014) (“[T]eaching and academic \n4  writing are at the core of the official duties of teachers and professors. Such teaching and writing are ‘a \n5  special concern of the First Amendment.’”) (quoting Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603); Meriwether v. Hartop, \n6  992 F.3d 492, 505 (6th Cir. 2021) (“[T]he First Amendment protects the free-speech rights of professors \n7  when they are teaching.”) (citing Sweezy v. State of N.H. by Wyman, 354 U.S. 234, 249-50 (1957) \n8  (plurality op.); Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603; Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-81 (1972)).  \n9  406.  Students have the First Amendment rights to engage in protest on a public university \n10  campus, including in public fora and limited public fora. See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 267 n.5 \n11  (1981) (“[S]tudents enjoy First Amendment rights of speech and association on the campus[.]”). That \n12  includes the right to engage in anonymous protest. See Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. \n13  595, 606 (2021) (“[C]ompelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute \n14  as effective a restraint on freedom of association as [other] forms of governmental action”); Buckley v. \n15  Am. Const. Law Found., 525 U.S. 182, 199 (1999) (“The injury to speech is heightened for the petition \n16  circulator because the badge requirement compels personal name identification at the precise moment \n17  when the circulator’s interest in anonymity is greatest.”).  \n18  407.  The First Amendment prohibits the government from using threats of legal sanction and \n19  other means of coercion to achieve the suppression of disfavored speech or academic freedom. Nor may \n20  the government coerce a third party to punish, suppress, or control speech on the government’s behalf. \n21  See Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am. v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175, 190 (2024). “[F]or decades it has been clearly \n22  established that the First Amendment tolerates neither laws nor other means of coercion, persuasion or \n23  intimidation ‘that cast a pall of orthodoxy’ over the free exchange of ideas in the classroom.” Dube v. \n24  State Univ. of N.Y., 900 F.2d 587, 598 (2d Cir. 1990) (quoting Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603). \n25  408.  The First Amendment likewise precludes the government from attempting to control \n26  academic thought and discourse on university campuses, and from interfering with a university’s \n27  curriculum or decisions concerning who may teach or areas of research.  \n28 \n  - 98 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 107 of 130\n \n \n1  409.  Defendants’ actions alleged herein violate the First Amendment because they constitute \n2  coercion and/or intimidation that is intended to and has the effect of inhibiting the free exchange of ideas \n3  and promoting a government orthodoxy. Defendants’ actions alleged herein have the purpose and effect \n4  of  establishing  a  system  of  both  direct  and  indirect  censorship  and  content-based  viewpoint \n5  discrimination against faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees at the UC. Defendants \n6  undertook such unlawful conduct with the intent to obstruct, chill, deter, and retaliate against Plaintiffs’ \n7  members’ core speech and academic freedom rights. \n8  410.  Defendants’ actions alleged herein further violate the First Amendment by targeting for \n9  retaliation and suppression specific areas or topics of research, scholarship, and other forms of expression \n10  based on content and viewpoint, and by seeking to punish the UC, its faculty, students, academic \n11  employees, and staff employees for engaging in speech disfavored by the federal government. \n12  411.  Defendants’ actions alleged herein further violate the First Amendment by infringing \n13  upon Plaintiffs’ and their members’ right to make expressive choices about what third-party speech to \n14  host and to provide a forum for the pursuit of intellectual and academic inquiry and debate. \n15  412.  Defendants’ actions alleged herein further violate the First Amendment because they \n16  constitute threats of legal and financial sanctions and conditions on federal funding with the purpose and \n17  effect of infringing on the free speech and academic freedom rights of UC faculty, students, academic \n18  employees, and staff employees, including Plaintiffs’ members. Each of these actions standing alone \n19  constitutes an independent First Amendment violation.  \n20  413.  Defendants have terminated hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, including for \n21  Plaintiffs’ members’ research, without any hearing or process in violation of Title VI and Title IX and \n22  without any other statutory or other legal authority. The First Amendment protects an academic’s ability \n23  to pursue research and scholarship free from arbitrary interference by the government. Independent of \n24  any other action, the unjustified halting of Plaintiffs’ members’ research and scholarship on an unlawful \n25  basis violates the First Amendment.  \n26  414.  Defendants’ concerted efforts to suppress disfavored expression on the UC’s campuses \n27  has already resulted in a sweeping chilling effect on the speech of Plaintiffs’ members as well as other \n28  faculty and students.  \n  - 99 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 108 of 130\n \n \n1  415.  Defendants’  unlawful  and  intentional  actions  are  not  justified  by  a  substantial  or \n2  compelling government interest and are not narrowly tailored to serve any such interest. \n3  416.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n4  See, e.g., Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326-27 (2015). This Court can and \n5  should exercise its equitable power to enter appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n \n6  COUNT II \n7  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nSeparation of Powers \n8  (Against All Defendants) \n9  417.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n10  418.  The Constitution vests the legislative power, including the spending power and the \n11  authority to place conditions on federal spending, in Congress. U.S. Const., art. I. Federal legislation \n12  must be passed by both chambers of Congress before it may be presented to the President, and, if signed, \n13  become law. Id.; I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983).  \n14  419.  The Constitution vests executive power in the President, U.S. Const., art. II, and imposes \n15  on the President a duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, §3.  \n16  420.  The President and Executive Branch have no constitutional power to unilaterally enact, \n17  amend, or repeal parts of duly enacted statutes. Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438–39 \n18  (1998). The declared purpose of separating and dividing the powers of government was to “diffuse[] \n19  power the better to secure liberty.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) \n20  (Jackson, J., concurring); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721–22 (1986) (“Justice Jackson’s \n21  words echo the famous warning of Montesquieu, quoted by James Madison in The Federalist No. 47, \n22  that ‘there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or \n23  body of magistrates’....” The Federalist No. 47, p. 325 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).”). \n24  421.  Congress exercised its Article I legislative and spending authority to authorize the federal \n25  grants and contracts that Defendants have awarded to the UC, including the federal grants and contracts \n26  that Defendants canceled on July 30-August 1.  \n27  422.  Congress also exercised its authority to adopt the carefully defined rules and procedures \n28  set forth in Title VI and Title IX that set forth the procedural requirements for termination of federal \n  - 100 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 109 of 130\n \n \n1  financial assistance. Defendants did not comply with these statutory requirements before summarily \n2  terminating $584 million in federal funding.  \n3  423.  None of the funds received by the UC have a congressionally authorized condition \n4  requiring the UC to comply with any of the demands in the August 8 Demand Letter or subjecting the \n5  UC to review in the manner Defendants have undertaken as alleged herein.  \n6  424.  No Article II constitutional power authorizes Defendants to cancel or withhold duly \n7  authorized federal funding on grounds not authorized by statute.  \n8  425.  No law or statute, including Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX, requires the UC to comply \n9  with the demands in the August 8 Demand Letter. The demands in the August 8 Demand Letter are not \n10  necessary to ensure compliance with Title VI, Title VII, or Title IX, or any other federal civil rights law, \n11  and Defendants lack authority to impose those demands or to take actions to enforce compliance with \n12  them.  \n13  426.  Neither Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, nor any other statutory provision authorized the \n14  Executive Branch to condition the UC’s restoration of the $584 million in canceled grant funds or to \n15  condition the UC’s further receipt of federal funds on the payment of $1 billion, or on UC’s agreement \n16  to take actions not necessary to achieve compliance with Title VI, Title VII, or Title IX. \n17  427.  No provision of the Constitution authorizes the Executive Branch to enact, amend, or \n18  repeal statutes, including Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX and appropriations approved and signed into \n19  law. \n20  428.  Defendants’ immediate cancellation of federal grants and contracts was not authorized \n21  by statute, overrode the direct Congressional authorization of federal funding, and overrode the express \n22  statutory limitations in Title VI and Title IX that Congress has placed on the cancellation of duly \n23  authorized federal funding. \n24  429.  Defendants’ imposition of additional conditions on the UC’s federal funds beyond those \n25  set forth in Title VI, Title IX, and the authorizing funding statutes was not authorized by statute, overrode \n26  the direct Congressional authorization of federal funding, and overrode the express statutory limits in \n27  Title VI and Title IX that Congress has placed on the termination or refusal to grant of duly authorized \n28  federal funding. \n  - 101 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 110 of 130\n \n \n1  430.  Defendants’ actions as alleged herein are not authorized by any Article II Executive \n2  power but rather are an unconstitutional usurpation of Congress’s spending power, an unconstitutional \n3  effort to amend congressional appropriations by attaching conditions not imposed by Congress, and a \n4  violation of the separation of powers. Defendants’ actions are therefore ultra vires.  \n5  431.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n6  See, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326-27. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter \n7  appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n \n8  COUNT III \n \n9  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nUnconstitutional Conditions / Spending Clause \n10  (Against All Defendants) \n11  432.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n12  433.  The “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine prohibits the federal government from using \n13  Congress’ spending power “to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be \n14  unconstitutional.” South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210-11 (1987). “Thus, for example, a grant of \n15  federal funds conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or the infliction of cruel and unusual \n16  punishment would be an illegitimate exercise of the Congress’ broad spending power.” Id. \n17  434.  The doctrine also prohibits the government from “requir[ing] a person to give up a \n18  constitutional right … in exchange for a discretionary benefit[.]” Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, \n19  385 (1994). Thus, a funding condition is unconstitutional if it “unconstitutional[ly] burden[s] … First \n20  Amendment rights.” Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214 (2013). \n21  435.  Defendants’ actions as alleged herein have infringed and impermissibly burdened the \n22  First Amendment and other constitutional rights of UC faculty, students, academic employees, and staff \n23  employees, including Plaintiffs’ members, by imposing unconstitutional conditions on the UC’s receipt \n24  of federal funds.  \n25  436.  Defendants’ course of conduct as alleged herein, including its August 8 Demand Letter, \n26  unconstitutionally conditions restoration of the unlawfully terminated $584 million and conditions UC’s \n27  eligibility for all federal funding on UC’s agreement to censor and suppress speech and academic \n28  freedom and engage in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, including but not \n  - 102 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 111 of 130\n \n \n1  limited to through restrictions on protests and expressive activities, sharing information about such \n2  expressive activity by faculty, academic employees, staff employees, and students with Defendants, and \n3  ceding control over certain curriculum and faculty hiring and promotion decisions to an external monitor. \n4  437.  Defendants’ course of conduct as alleged herein, including its August 8 Demand Letter, \n5  unconstitutionally conditions restoration of the unlawfully terminated $584 million and conditions UC’s \n6  eligibility for all federal funding on UC’s agreement to infringe the equal protection rights of transgender \n7  individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n8  438.  Defendants’ course of conduct as alleged herein, including its August 8 Demand Letter, \n9  unconstitutionally conditions restoration of the unlawfully terminated $584 million and conditions UC’s \n10  eligibility for all federal funding on UC’s agreement to infringe other constitutional rights of UC \n11  students, faculty, academic employees, and staff employees. \n12  439.  Defendants’  conditions  do  not  just  “define  the  limits  of  the  government  spending \n13  program” by “specify[ing] the activities [the government] wants to subsidize”; rather, they seek to \n14  “leverage funding” to regulate unrelated aspects of campus life, including activities protected by the First \n15  Amendment, “outside the contours” of any discrete federal program. See Agency for Int’l Dev., 570 U.S.  \n16  at 214–15. \n17  440.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ members have been, and are being, harmed by Defendants’ \n18  actual and threatened imposition of unconstitutional conditions on the receipt of federal funding. \n19  441.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n20  See, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326-27. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter \n21  appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n \n22  COUNT IV \n23  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nViolation of Tenth Amendment / Spending Clause \n24  (Against All Defendants) \n25  442.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n26  443.  The Tenth Amendment provides: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n27  Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” \n28  U.S. Const. amend. X. \n  - 103 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 112 of 130\n \n \n1  444.  As the text of the Tenth Amendment makes clear, the Constitution created a federal \n2  government of limited and enumerated powers. See NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 533-34 (2012) \n3  (opinion of Roberts, C.J.) (“In our federal system, the National Government possesses only limited \n4  powers; the States and the people retain the remainder.”). \n5  445.  No provision of the Constitution delegates to the federal government the power to take \n6  over day-to-day management of a private or state university or to control core aspects of its academic \n7  mission.  \n8  446.  “The Spending Clause of the Federal Constitution … provides Congress broad discretion \n9  to tax and spend for the ‘general Welfare,’ including by funding particular state or private programs or \n10  activities.” Agency for Int’l Dev., 570 U.S. at 213. “That power includes the authority to impose limits \n11  on the use of such funds to ensure they are used in the manner Congress intends.” Id. However, the \n12  federal government cannot use funding limits to circumvent constitutional constraints on the scope of \n13  federal power, such as those imposed by the Tenth Amendment. See id. at 214; NFIB, 567 U.S. at 575-\n14  81 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.). \n15  447.  The anti-commandeering doctrine reflects a “fundamental structural decision” in the \n16  Constitution, “the decision to withhold from Congress the power to issue orders directly to the States.” \n17  Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1475 (2018). The doctrine prohibits the federal government from \n18  commanding states to legislate or regulate on the federal government’s behalf. See New York v. United \n19  States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 925 (1997) (“[T]he Federal \n20  Government may not compel the States to implement, by legislation or executive action, federal \n21  regulatory programs.”).  \n22  448.  Federal  attempts  to  regulate  via  purported  funding  inducements  raise  heightened \n23  constitutional concerns when, as here, the amount of funding at issue is so large as to be coercive, \n24  purported funding conditions are not tied to particular programs directly utilizing those funds, and \n25  program recipients are unfairly surprised by post-acceptance or “retroactive” conditions. See NFIB, 567 \n26  U.S. at 580-81, 584 (explaining that a purported “financial inducement” to participate in a federal \n27  program exceeds the scope of the federal government’s Spending Clause power where it is “so coercive \n28  as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion,’” and concluding that the inducement there \n  - 104 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 113 of 130\n \n \n1  at issue was unconstitutionally coercive because, as a practical matter, it resembled “a gun to the head” \n2  instead of offering “relatively mild encouragement” to adopt and implement a federal regulatory \n3  program). \n4  449.  Federal funding constitutes nearly one-third of the UC’s entire operating budget. Federal \n5  grant funding accounts for 52 percent of all UC research funding sources and is the University’s single \n6  most important source of research funding. Federal student aid programs represent the largest source of \n7  financial aid for UC students. Defendants’ threat to withhold potentially billions more in federal funding \n8  from the UC unless it accedes to the unlawful demands set forth in its August 8 Demand Letter thus \n9  constitutes a proverbial “gun to the head” and crosses the line from mere financial inducement to \n10  impermissible coercion, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  \n11  450.  The August 8 Demand Letter imposes a series of demands that usurp the UC’s regulation \n12  of core state functions and coerce the UC to instead carry out the Trump administration’s federal policies \n13  in these areas, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  \n14  451.  For example, the August 8 Demand Letter commands that the UC adopt policies that \n15  would impinge on the free speech and academic freedom rights of UC faculty, students, academic \n16  employees, and staff employees under the California Constitution.  \n17  452.  The August 8 Demand Letter also commands that the UC adopt policies aimed at ending \n18  UCLA’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including a review of policies and programs related to \n19  such efforts in faculty, hiring, retention, and promotion. Such policies are not required under federal law \n20  and are inconsistent with California policy. See SFFA, 600 U.S. at 230. \n21  453.  The August 8 Demand Letter also commands that the UC adopt a number of policy \n22  changes  that  infringe  on  the  rights  of  transgender  faculty,  students,  academic  employees,  staff \n23  employees, and other individuals interacting with the UC System secured under California law and not \n24  in conflict with federal law, and which policy changes are not necessary to achieve compliance with \n25  Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, or any other federal law. For example, the August 8 Demand Letter demands \n26  that UCLA make a public statement adopting and stating that it agrees with the Trump administration’s \n27  definitions of “male,” “female,” and “sex,” bar gender-inclusive and gender-appropriate use of locker \n28  rooms and restrooms, and refuse to provide gender-affirming medical care to individuals under the age \n  - 105 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 114 of 130\n \n \n1  of 18. These demands require the UC to violate California laws that are not in conflict with federal law, \n2  including but not limited to the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code §51, and Government Code §11135, \n3  which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. \n4  454.  Defendants’ course of conduct as alleged herein has crossed the line from financial \n5  inducement to impermissible coercion, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  \n6  455.  Thus, even if Congress had authorized Defendants’ ongoing attempt to effectively seize \n7  control of the UC, backed up by overt threats to summarily and indiscriminately terminate billions of \n8  dollars in funding en masse, any such coercion contravenes the principle of federalism embodied in the \n9  Tenth Amendment and exceeds the scope of the federal government’s authority under the Spending \n10  Clause. \n11  456.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n12  See, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326-27. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter \n13  appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n \n14  COUNT V \n15  Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions;  \nViolation of Fifth Amendment (Due Process; Void for Vagueness) \n16  (Against All Defendants) \n17  457.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n18  458.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n19  requires due process of law before the deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest. \n20  459.  Plaintiffs’ members have constitutionally protected property interests in funding that \n21  supports their salaries and stipends, as well as in their ongoing research. Plaintiffs’ members have relied \n22  on this funding, and the protections of federal law governing this funding, in pursuing their research, \n23  hiring staff, making commitments to research partners, and in many other ways. Plaintiffs’ members also \n24  have constitutionally protected liberty interests in their freedom of speech and expression, including \n25  academic freedom, and in pursuing their livelihoods. \n26  460.  Defendants’ termination of federal funding as set forth in this Complaint does not provide \n27  the UC or Plaintiffs’ members fair notice or a reasonable opportunity to be heard. \n28 \n  - 106 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 115 of 130\n \n \n1  461.  The Due Process Clause also prohibits government actions that fail to give fair notice of \n2  what conduct is forbidden or required. \n3  462.  Defendants’  actions  alleged  herein  establish  unconstitutionally  vague  standards  for \n4  determining whether federal funding will be terminated and do not tie the cancellation of grants and \n5  contracts to specific alleged acts or omissions, much less specific conduct reasonably related to the grants \n6  and contracts at issue. Nor have Defendants provided any adequate notice to Plaintiffs’ members or to \n7  the UC regarding what conduct was forbidden or required to avoid such consequences. \n8  463.  Federal courts have the equitable power to enjoin unlawful actions by executive officials. \n9  See, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326-27. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter \n10  appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. \n11  COUNT VI \n \n12  Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A), (C), (D)  \n(Contrary to and Exceeds Authority Under Title VI;  \n13  Without Observance of Required Procedure) \n(Against Defendants DOJ, Bondi, Terrell, and Funding Agency Defendants) \n14 \n464.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n15 \n465.  Defendants’  July  30-August  1  funding  withdrawal  and  August  8  Demand  Letter \n16 \nconstitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” under 5 U.S.C. §704 and 42 U.S.C. §2000d-2, \n17 \nas well as “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court” under 5 U.S.C. \n18 \n§704, and are therefore subject to judicial review. 5 U.S.C. §§702, 704. The cancellation of grants and \n19 \ncontracts is the ultimate step in the Title VI enforcement process and alters the rights and obligations of \n20 \nthe parties with respect to the terms of those grants and contracts, with legal and concrete consequences \n21 \nfor Columbia, Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs’ members.  \n22 \n466.  Defendants’ “Task Force Policy” is also such final agency action. Defendants have \n23 \nadopted a new Task Force Policy that leverages the federal government’s enforcement authority over \n24 \nfederal civil rights laws and federal grant program rules to impose and threaten legal and financial \n25 \nsanctions on universities for alleged but unproven civil rights violations, but without complying with \n26 \nthose laws’ procedural requirements, and including financial sanctions not authorized under those laws, \n27 \nto coerce universities into implementing unrelated, ideological changes, including suppression of free \n28 \n  - 107 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 116 of 130\n \n \n1  speech, rights of association and academic freedom, diversity initiatives, transgender recognition, equity \n2  efforts, and whatever else the administration finds distasteful. A critical component of the Task Force \n3  Policy is that Defendants are sanctioning schools after cursory or nonexistent investigations, a marked \n4  change from Defendants’ previous rules governing Titles VI, VII, and IX investigations and federal \n5  funding. \n6  467.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are found to \n7  be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. \n8  §706(2)(A).  \n9  468.  The APA further directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are \n10  without observance of procedure required by law. Id. §706(2)(D). \n11  469.  The July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal and August 8 Demand Letter were issued and \n12  carried out pursuant to the Task Force Policy. \n13  470.  No  lawful  grant  or  contract  condition  authorized  the  July  30-August  1  funding \n14  withdrawal, August 8 Demand Letter, or Task Force Policy. Nothing in Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, or \n15  any other law authorized the funding withdrawal or the conditioning of federal funds on the payment of \n16  money or other terms not necessary to achieve compliance with those statutes. \n17  471.  Section 602 and applicable, binding regulations with the force of law set forth procedural \n18  requirements that must be followed in order to terminate or refuse to grant federal funding for alleged \n19  noncompliance with Title VI’s substantive requirements. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1; 28 C.F.R. \n20  §§42.106–111 (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §§611.1–13 (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §§80.6–80.11 (HHS); NIH Grants Policy \n21  Statement 4.1.2.1; 10 C.F.R. §§1040.101–131 (DOE). \n22  472.  Because Defendants failed to follow these requirements before implementing the Task \n23  Force Policy by (1) terminating funding to the University on July 30-August 1 and (2) demanding \n24  compliance with the August 8 Demand Letter as a condition of future funding, Defendants’ actions were \n25  contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and without observance of procedure required by law. \n26  473.  Pursuant to the Task Force Policy, prior to the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal and \n27  August 8 Demand Letter, Defendants did not attempt to achieve voluntary compliance with Title VI or \n28  determine that such voluntary compliance could not be achieved. Nor did Defendants provide an \n  - 108 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 117 of 130\n \n \n1  opportunity for a hearing or make an express finding on the record as to the University’s alleged \n2  noncompliance  with  Title  VI.  Nor  did  any  “responsible  Department  official”  determine  that  the \n3  University’s compliance could not be secured by voluntary means. Moreover, no head of any Federal \n4  department  or  agency  filed  with  any  committees  of  the  House  and  Senate  a  “full  report  of  the \n5  circumstances and the grounds” for the action terminating or refusing to grant or continue federal \n6  assistance to the University because of a failure to comply with Title VI. Nor did thirty days elapse after \n7  the filing of any such report. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1; 28 C.F.R. §42.108(c) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. \n8  §611.8(c) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.8(c) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; 10 C.F.R. §1040.114 \n9  (DOE). \n10  474.  Pursuant to the Task Force Policy, prior to the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal and \n11  August 8 Demand Letter, Defendants did not provide notice of a hearing or conduct any hearing, much \n12  less conduct a hearing that conforms with their own regulations or sections 5–8 of the APA. See, e.g., \n13  28 C.F.R. §42.109(a) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §611.9(a) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.9(a) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy \n14  Statement 4.1.2.1; cf. 10 C.F.R. §1040.121 (DOE).  \n15  475.  Pursuant to the Task Force Policy, prior to the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal and \n16  August 8 Demand Letter,  Defendants failed to provide the University with a reasonable opportunity to \n17  file briefs or other written statements of its contentions and further failed to issue a decision consistent \n18  with the applicable regulations before terminating funding on March 7. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. §42.110(d) \n19  (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §611.10(d) (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.10(d) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.1; \n20  cf. 10 C.F.R. §1040.121(b) (DOE). \n21  476.  Pursuant to the Task Force Policy, Defendants did not limit the July 30-August 1 funding \n22  withdrawal  or  August  8  Demand  Letter  to  any  particular  program,  or  part  thereof,  in  which \n23  noncompliance has been found. Nor was such withdrawal limited in its effect to any particular program, \n24  or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been found. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1; 28 C.F.R. \n25  §42.108(c) (DOJ); 45 C.F.R. §611.8 (NSF); 45 C.F.R. §80.8(c) (HHS); NIH Grants Policy Statement \n26  4.1.2.1; 10 C.F.R. §1040.114(e) (DOE).  \n27 \n28 \n  - 109 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 118 of 130\n \n \n1  477.  Defendants’ Task Force Policy, July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal, and August 8 \n2  Demand Letter are not authorized by any law, and no department or agency determined that compliance \n3  could not be secured by voluntary means prior to initiating those actions.  \n4  478.  Plaintiffs and their members are persons who have suffered legal wrong as a result of, \n5  and have been adversely affected or aggrieved by, Defendants’ Task Force Policy, July 30-August 1 \n6  withdrawal of funds, and August 8 Demand Letter for purposes of 5 U.S.C. §702 and 42 U.S.C. §2000d-\n7  2. \nCOUNT VII \n8 \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A), (C), (D)  \n9  (Contrary to and Exceeds Authority Under Title IX;  \nWithout Observance of Required Procedure) \n10  (Against Defendants DOJ, Bondi, Terrell, and Funding Agency Defendants) \n11  479.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n12  480.  Defendants’  July  30-August  1  funding  withdrawal  and  August  8  Demand  Letter \n13  constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” under 5 U.S.C. §704 and 42 U.S.C. §2000d-2, \n14  as well as “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court” under 5 U.S.C. \n15  §704, and are therefore subject to judicial review. 5 U.S.C. §§702, 704.

The July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal and August 8 Demand Letter were carried out \n9  pursuant to the Task Force Policy. \n10  485.  No  lawful  grant  or  contract  condition  authorized  the  July  30-August  1  funding \n11  withdrawal, August 8 Demand Letter, or Task Force Policy. Nothing in Title VI, Title VII, Title IX or \n12  any other law authorized the funding withdrawal. \n13  486.  Section 902 of Title IX and applicable, binding regulations with the force of law set forth \n14  procedural  requirements  that  must  be  followed  in  order  to  terminate federal  funding  for  alleged \n15  noncompliance with Title IX’s substantive requirements. 20 U.S.C. §1682; 28 C.F.R. §54.605 (DOJ) \n16  (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 28 CFR 42.106 through 42.111”); 45 C.F.R. \n17  §618.605 (NSF) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 45 CFR part 611”); 45 C.F.R. \n18  §86.71 (HHS) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 45 CFR 80.6 through 80.11 and 45 \n19  CFR part 81”); NIH Grants Policy Statement 4.1.2.2 (applying the HHS implementing regulations for \n20  Title IX); 10 C.F.R. §1042.605 (DOE) (applying the Title VI procedural provisions “found at 10 CFR \n21  part 1040, subparts G and H”). \n22  487.

Pursuant to the Task Force Policy, prior to the July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal and \n27  August 8 Demand Letter, Defendants did not issue to the UC a notice of findings of any alleged violations \n28  of Title IX.

The cancellation of grants and \n15  contracts is the ultimate step in the Title VI and Title IX enforcement processes and alters the rights and \n16  obligations of the parties with respect to the terms of those grants and contracts, with legal and concrete \n17  consequences for the UC, Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs’ members.  \n18  496.  The July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal and August 8 Demand Letter were carried out \n19  pursuant to the Task Force Policy, which is itself also a final agency action for APA purposes. \n20  497.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are found to \n21  be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. \n22  §706(2)(A).  \n23  498.  Agency action is arbitrary or capricious where it is not “reasonable and reasonably \n24  explained.” Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024). This standard requires that agencies provide “a \n25  satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between the facts found and the \n26  choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n27  43 (1983) (quotation omitted). An action is also arbitrary and capricious if the agency “failed to consider \n28 \n  - 113 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 122 of 130\n \n \n1  ... important aspect[s] of the problem.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v.

Defendants’ July 30-August 1 funding withdrawal, August 8 Demand Letter, and Task \n4  Force Policy are arbitrary and capricious because those decisions were not objectively reasonable and \n5  Defendants failed to provide a reasoned explanation for those decisions.  \n6  500.  Defendants’ stated reasons for cancellation of federal grants and contracts to UCLA, \n7  carried out pursuant to the Task Force Policy, are not reasonable, are arbitrary and capricious, and are \n8  not rationally related to the breadth of the cancellations, as described in Part IV.C above. Defendants \n9  DOJ, NIH, NSF, and DOE rely solely on complaints of antisemitism that stem from events from late \n10  April and early May 2024 surrounding an encampment on UCLA’s campus, failing to address or \n11  acknowledge the existence of a resolution agreement that dealt with the same events, and without \n12  considering or assessing the adequacy of steps UC and UCLA have taken since May 2024 to address \n13  antisemitism. Defendants NIH, NSF, and DOE also acted arbitrarily by basing the termination of federal \n14  grants and contracts on unsubstantiated and unreasonable findings of unlawful, race-based admissions \n15  practice and sex discrimination. Defendants NIH, NSF, and DOE also failed to consider reliance issues \n16  or the value of the research for which funding was terminated. \n17  501.  Defendants’ August 8 Demand Letter, issued pursuant to the Task Force Policy, is \n18  arbitrary  and  capricious  for  the  additional  reason  that  it  makes  numerous  demands  that  bear  no \n19  reasonable relationship to the stated cause for concerns: discrimination based on religion, nationality, \n20  race, or sex. \n \n21  COUNT IX \n22  Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A), (B): Contrary to Constitution \n(First Amendment) \n23  (Against Defendants DOJ, Bondi, Terrell, and Funding Agency Defendants) \n24  502.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n25  503.  Defendants’  July  30-August  1  funding  withdrawal  and  August  8  Demand  Letter \n26  constitute “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute,” 5 U.S.C. §704, as well as “final agency action \n27  for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,” 5 U.S.C. §704, and are therefore subject to \n28  judicial review. 5 U.S.C. §§702, 704. \n  - 114 - \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 24     Filed 10/09/25     Page 123 of 130\n \n \n1  504.

Any and all findings related to investigation of the UC or any of its campuses or \n6 medical centers under Title VI, VII, or IX since January 20, 2025; \n7 b.  The August 8 Demand Letter, as identified in the accompanying Memorandum of \n8 Points and Authorities, setting forth conditions under which the purportedly suspended UCLA grant \n9 funds would be restored, and any counter-proposals or further proposals related thereto; \n10 c.  All communications between the UC and any Defendant or agent of any Defendant \n11 concerning the August 8, 2025 Demand Letter, any proposed terms set forth therein, potential resolution \n12 of the UCLA grant suspensions, or any potential suspension or termination of grants to the UC or any of \n13 its campuses or affiliated medical centers. \n14 This Motion is made on the grounds that (1) Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \n15 claims that (a) Defendants’ Task Force Policy and Termination Letters, as described in the accompanying \n16 Memorandum of Points and Authorities, violate the First Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, the \n17 Spending Clause, and constitutional separation of powers, and so are ultra vires and contrary to law in \n18 violation of the APA; (b) Defendants’ Task Force Policy and Termination Letters violate Title VI of the \n19 Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000d et seq., and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \n20 20 U.S.C. §1681 et seq., and so are contrary to law and procedure and exceed statutory authority in \n21 violation of the APA; and (c) Defendants’ Task Force Policy and Termination Letters are arbitrary and \n22 capricious in violation of the APA; (2) Plaintiffs and their members will suffer irreparable harm unless \n23 the requested preliminary injunctive relief is granted; (3) the balance of equities weighs in favor of \n24 granting the requested preliminary injunctive relief; and (4) the public interest favors injunctive relief. \n25 Plaintiffs’ motion is based on this Notice of Motion, the attached Memorandum of Points and \n26 Authorities, the accompanying Declaration of Drew Mammel, the Compendium of Plaintiff and Member \n27 Declarations (comprising 60 declarations), the Declaration of Catherine Lhamon, the proposed order \n28\n- 4 - \nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND  \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION    Case No. 3:25-cv-07864-RFL \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 26     Filed 10/09/25     Page 6 of 8\n \n1 submitted herewith, the pleadings and records on file with the Court, and any further briefing and \n2 arguments of counsel. \n3        Respectfully submitted, \n4 Dated:  October 9, 2025     By: /s/ Connie K.

TRUMP, in his official capacity   ) \n12 \nAs President of the United States, et al.,   ) \n) \n13   \nDefendants. \n14   \n \n15 \nPursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-11 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b)(1)(A), Defendants \n16 \nhereby move the Court for an order staying the deadline to respond to Plaintiffs’ motion for a \n17 \npreliminary injunction and the deadlines for the Joint Case Management Statement and Initial Case \n18 \nManagement Conference, and continuing all such deadlines until after Congress has enacted funding for \n19 \nthe Department of Justice and the shutdown of the federal government has come to an end.   \n20 \n1.  At midnight on September 30, 2025, the appropriations act that had been funding the \n21 \nDepartment of Justice expired and appropriations to the Department lapsed.  The same is true for other \n22 \nExecutive agencies, including the federal Defendants.  The Department does not know when funding \n23 \nwill be restored by Congress. \n24 \n2.  The Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. §1341, as construed by the Attorney General, \n25 \nprovides that in the absence of appropriated funds no obligation can be incurred except for the protection \n26 \nof life and property, the orderly suspension of operations, or as otherwise authorized by law.  Absent an \n27 \nappropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the Defendant agencies are prohibited \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ STAY MOTION \n25-CV-07864-RFL \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 35     Filed 10/10/25     Page 2 of 4\n \n \n \n1  from working, even on a volunteer basis, “except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or \n2  the protection of property.”  31 U.S.C. § 1342.  An officer or employee of the United States who violates \n3  31 U.S.C. § 1341(a) (obligate/expend in excess or advance of appropriation), § 1342 (voluntary services \n4  prohibition), or § 1517(a) (obligate/expend in excess of an apportionment or administrative subdivision \n5  as specified in an agency’s regulations) “shall be subject to appropriate administrative discipline \n6  including, when circumstances warrant, suspension from duty without pay or removal from office.”  31 \n7  U.S.C. §§ 1349(a), 1518 (emphasis added).     \n8  3.  Undersigned counsel has been furloughed for the duration of the lapse in appropriations.  \n9  Undersigned counsel is not permitted to work on the instant case during the lapse in appropriations, with \n10  the exception of being exempted for the sole and limited purpose of preparing this stay motion and other \n11  activities incident to its filing.  In addition, the input of employees from Defendant agencies is necessary \n12  and if the instant motion is denied, the work needed from the agencies may not be possible. \n13  4.  Defendants respectfully submit that the Anti-Deficiency Act’s factors are not satisfied \n14  and that upcoming deadlines in this case do not constitute emergencies under 31 U.S.C. § 1342, \n15  particularly in light of the preliminary injunction order entered by this Court in Thakur v. Trump, No. \n16  25-cv-04737.   \n17  5.  Defendants therefore request a stay of the deadline to respond to Plaintiffs’ motion for a \n18  preliminary injunction and the deadlines for the Joint Case Management Statement and Initial Case \n19  Management Conference until Congress has restored appropriations to the Department.  Defendants \n20  further request that, at that point, all current deadlines in this case be extended for a period of time \n21  commensurate with the duration of the lapse in appropriations – i.e., each deadline would be extended \n22  by the total number of days of the lapse in appropriations.   \n23  6.  Although this Court has authority to extend or stay these deadlines without a formal \n24  motion or notice to opposing counsel, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1)(A), undersigned counsel nevertheless \n25  contacted Plaintiffs’ counsel to either avoid a preliminary injunction motion or to negotiate a briefing \n26  schedule.  During the course of those discussions, Plaintiffs’ counsel generally opposed a stay of the \n27  briefing schedule for Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction unless Defendants agreed “they will \n28  not refuse to grant, withhold, freeze, suspend, terminate, condition, or otherwise restrict use of federal \n  DEFENDANTS’ STAY MOTION \n25-CV-07864-RFL \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 35     Filed 10/10/25     Page 3 of 4\n \n \n \n1  funds, or threaten to do so, to the UC or any of its campuses, affiliated medical centers, or laboratories, \n2  based on alleged discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex, or for any other \n3  purpose intended to coerce the UC into changing its policies or practices.”  Defendants cannot agree to \n4  this condition under the circumstances present.  In an attempt to determine whether there would be a \n5  possibility of compromise, undersigned counsel asked Plaintiffs’ counsel to provide a list of the grants \n6  Plaintiffs request not be suspended or terminated while the motion for preliminary injunction is being \n7  briefed and decided.  Plaintiffs’ counsel stated that Plaintiffs would “be seeking to enjoin terminations of \n8  funding (research grants or otherwise) by all the defendants we have named.  Many of those defendants, \n9  as you know, are already subject to an injunction in Thakur.  We don’t plan to list the specific grants – \n10  just the defendant agencies.”  Plaintiffs also oppose a stay of the deadlines for the Joint Case \n11  Management Statement and Initial Case Management Conference. \n12  7.

TRUMP, et al.,  SCHEDULE ON PLAINTIFFS’ \nMOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY \nDefendants. \nINJUNCTION \n  Re: Dkt. Nos. 26, 30, 33, 35, 37 \n \n   \n \nOn October 9, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.  (Dkt. No. 26, \n“PI Motion.”)  Plaintiffs concurrently filed a motion for leave to file under seal certain \ndeclarations and references thereto, and to permit certain declarants to proceed pseudonymously.  \n(Dkt. No. 30.)  Because Plaintiffs have shown that compelling reasons exist to seal the relevant \ndocuments, and that it is appropriate to permit four declarants to proceed pseudonymously, the \nunopposed motion is GRANTED.  The declarations listed in Docket No. 30-2 at 3–4 shall \nremain sealed, and Plaintiffs are granted leave to file four declarations pseudonymously: UPTE \nDoe, CIR Doe, Local 4811 Doe, and UCLA-FA Doe.  All references to the content of those \ndeclarations and to declarants’ names shall be filed under seal.  Counsel for Defendants may \nreview the sealed documents, but may not disclose them to Defendants.   \nDefendants have moved to stay their deadline to respond to the PI Motion, and to file a \ncase management statement, until the “shutdown of the federal government has come to an end.”  \n(Dkt. No. 35 at 1.)  The motion is DENIED.  Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief based \n1 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 41     Filed 10/14/25     Page 2 of 3\non their claims that Defendants have unlawfully terminated millions of dollars of grants funding \ntheir work, and will continue to do so, causing what Plaintiffs contend is irreparable harm.  \nDefendants have not committed to voluntarily forbear from the challenged funding terminations \nduring the government shutdown.  (Dkt. No. 38 at 2–3.)  As it appears that Defendants have the \nresources to continue terminating grants despite the lapse in appropriations, they must also \nallocate resources to defend the legality of those terminations in court.  Furthermore, Defendants \nacknowledge that, if ordered to do so by the Court, their counsel is authorized to continue to \nlitigate this case.  (Dkt. No. 39 at 2.)  For these reasons, a stay is not appropriate at this time.  See \nCMAX, Inc. v. Hall, 300 F.2d 265, 268 (9th Cir. 1962) (“Where it is proposed that a pending \nproceeding be stayed, the competing interests which will be affected by the granting or refusal to \ngrant a stay must be weighed.”); see also Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 708 (1997) (“The \nproponent of a stay bears the burden of establishing its need.”).   \nIn the alternative, Defendants request “an additional 14 days to respond to Plaintiffs’ [PI \nMotion] in order to afford Defendants an opportunity to navigate agency furloughs and gather \nnecessary facts.”  (Dkt. No. 39 at 3.)  However, Defendants have not provided any specific \ninformation or evidence as to how those furloughs will impede their ability to gather the facts to \noppose the motion on the standard briefing timeline.  As such, Defendants have not carried their \nburden as to the requested extension.  See N.D. Cal. Civil L. R. 6-3(a) (a party seeking to enlarge \ntime must “[s]et[] forth with particularity the reasons for the requested enlargement” and \n“[i]dentif[y] the substantial harm or prejudice that would occur if the Court did not change the \ntime”).  The request is therefore denied.   \nThe parties’ joint stipulation regarding the briefing schedule (Dkt. No. 37) is \nGRANTED.  The deadline for Defendants to file any response or opposition to Plaintiffs’ PI \nMotion is October 24, 2025.  Plaintiffs’ reply shall be due by October 31, 2025.   A hearing on \nthe PI Motion is set for November 6, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.1  By October 31, 2025, the parties \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ motion to specially set a hearing date (Dkt. No. 33) is DENIED AS MOOT.   \n2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-07864-RFL     Document 41     Filed 10/14/25     Page 3 of 3\nshall submit a joint statement indicating whether they intend to call any witnesses to testify at the \nhearing on the PI Motion.  The statement shall list all witnesses who will be called, what topics \neach witness will testify to, and the estimated length of the testimony.  The deadline to file a case \nmanagement statement, and the initial case management conference, are VACATED, and will \nbe reset by the Court.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: October 14, 2025 \n   \nRITA F.
