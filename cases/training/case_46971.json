Defendant IRS is an agency of the United States as defined by 5 U.S.C.  \nยงยง 552a(a), (e), and subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. One or more employees of \nthe IRS are responsible for the unlawful actions taken against Ms. Paz. \n \n \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03256     Document 1     Filed 09/18/25     Page 3 of 8\n \n  5.  Defendant Treasury is an agency of the United States as defined by 5 U.S.C.  \nยงยง 552a(a), (e), and subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. Treasury is responsible for \nthe actions of its component Defendant IRS. Additionally, the Secretary of the Treasury \nScott Bessant also serves as the Acting IRS Commissioner. \nFACTS \n  6.  On or about July 29, 2025, Defendant IRS placed Ms. Paz on paid administrative \nleave. No reason was provided for this action. \n  7.  On or about September 2, 2025, Defendant IRS issued a Notice of Proposed \nAdverse Action (โProposalโ) to Ms. Paz that proposes to remove her from federal service  \nโin order to promote the efficiency of the Service.โ Defendant IRS is relying upon \nallegations that date back nearly two decades and involve matters that had been \npreviously investigated and resolved in her favor. By the very nature of the title of this \ndocument, this is a proposed action that does not presently modify Ms. Pazโs status with \nDefendant IRS. She remains fully employed, though still on administrative leave, while \nthis administrative disciplinary process continues. \n  8.  By e-mail sent at 9:00 am EDT on Tuesday, September 9, 2025, Defendant IRS \ngranted Ms. Paz until on or before October 17, 2025, to submit her written response to \nthe Proposal. Per her request, Defendant IRS has also granted Ms. Paz the opportunity to \nrespond to the Proposal in an oral reply, the date of which has not yet been set. \n  9.  Notwithstanding the above, FoxNews.com published an article written by reporter \nBrooke Singman at 11:28 am EDT (updated 11:58 am EDT) on Tuesday, September 9, \n2025, with the headline: โIRS fires top aide linked to Obama-era Tea Party targeting \nscandalโ. The article went on to falsely state that โSources told Fox News Digital that \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03256     Document 1     Filed 09/18/25     Page 4 of 8\n \nHolly Paz, who served as the IRS Commissioner of Large Business and International \nDivision, was terminated Monday [September 8, 2025].โ Ms. Singman further noted that \nMs. Paz had been โsubsequently fired following an internal review, sources say.โ  \n  10. The FoxNews.com false reporting was echoed by the Washington Examiner in an \narticle with the headline โIRS aide Holly Paz fired after review of her targeting \nconservative organizations,โ which was written by David Zimmermann and posted online \nat 3:12 pm EDT on September 9, 2025. \n  11. Upon being notified that Ms. Paz had, in fact, not been terminated from her \nemployment, FoxNews.com edited its story at 8:10 pm EDT on September 9, 2025, so \nthat its headline now reads โIRS issues termination notice to top aide linked to Obama-\nera Tea Party targeting scandalโ with a sub-headline: โSources say Holly Paz was given a \nnotice of proposed removal by her IRS supervisor Monday after being placed on \nadministrative leaveโ. Beyond the many factual errors in the revised article, Ms. Singman \nfurther noted that โSources told Fox News Digital that Paz, who served as the IRS \nCommissioner of the Large Business and International Division, received the notice on \nMonday.โ The Washington Examiner similarly modified its headline to read  \nโIRS official Holly Paz proposed for removal after review of her targeting conservative \norganizationsโ. \n  12. By e-mail sent at 1:53 pm EDT on September 10, 2025, Defendant IRS confirmed \nto the undersigned counsel that โMs. Paz has not been fired. Currently, she is a federal \nemployee on administrative leave; the Agency has proposed her removal and she is \ncurrently in the advance notice period.โ  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03256     Document 1     Filed 09/18/25     Page 5 of 8\n \n  13. The unlawful disclosure of Ms. Pazโs false termination and then proposed firing \nwas not the first time the Defendants sought to smear her name by retrieving information \nfrom one or more of her Privacy Act Systems of Records and then disclosing it to \nunauthorized individuals. On July 29, 2025, at 8:52 pm EDT, Ms. Paz was notified by \nDefendant IRS she was being placed on administrative leave. No reason was given for \nthis action. Not even an hour later, at 9:38 pm EDT, Bloomberg Tax, in an article entitled \nโIRS Heads of Large Business Unit, Tax Pro Oversight Put on Leave,โ reported this personnel \naction had taken place โaccording to a person familiar with the situation.โ The article \nfurther indicated that Ms. Paz and a colleague โwere put on leave while the IRS \ninvestigates their conduct against Republicans, the source said, adding that the leave \ndoesnโt mean they are fired.โ \n  14. Information concerning Ms. Pazโs employment, to include proposed adverse \nactions or final disciplinary decisions, is maintained within one or more Systems of \nRecords maintained by the Defendants. The information contained in the articles by \nFoxNews.com and repeated by the Washington Examiner relied upon information \nidentifiable to Ms. Paz and retrieved from one or more Privacy Act Systems of Records. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nPRIVACY ACT โ 5 U.S.C. ยง 552a(b), (g) \n \n  15.

There is no exception that permitted Defendants IRS/Treasury to retrieve and then \ndisseminate Privacy Act-protected information concerning Ms. Paz, particularly that of \nher being placed on administrative leave and proposed termination, to the news media \nand/or other unauthorized third parties. \n  18. Ms. Paz never provided Defendants IRS/Treasury with written (or verbal) consent \nto disseminate any information retrieved from one or more Systems of Records that was \nidentifiable to her. \n  19. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง 552a(g)(1), Ms. Paz may bring a civil action against \nDefendants IRS/Treasury for the unauthorized dissemination of information contained in \na system of records. \n  20.

Ms. Paz repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 6 through \n14 above, inclusive. \n  22.

Prior to disseminating records about Ms. Paz, Defendants IRS/Treasury failed to \nmake reasonable efforts to assure that such records are accurate, complete, timely, and \nrelevant for agency purposes and thereby violated 5 U.S.C. ยง 552a(e)(6). Specifically, \nDefendants IRS/Treasury failed to ensure those records accurately reflected only that  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03256     Document 1     Filed 09/18/25     Page 7 of 8\n \nMs. Paz had been proposed for termination, not that she had in fact already been \nterminated.  \n  24. Defendants IRS/Treasury, their employees and officers, knew or should have \nknown that their actions were improper, unlawful and/or in violation of the Privacy Act.  \n  25. Defendants IRS/Treasury, their employees and officers, acted intentionally or \nwillfully in violation of Ms. Pazโ privacy rights. \n  26. As a result of the Defendants IRS/Treasuryโs violations of the Privacy Act, Ms. \nPaz has suffered adverse and harmful effects, including, but not limited to, lost or \njeopardized present or future financial opportunities. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT โ 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202 \n \n  27.

Ms. Paz has suffered adverse and harmful effects, including, but not limited to, \nlost or jeopardized present or future financial opportunities.  \n \n \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03256     Document 1     Filed 09/18/25     Page 8 of 8\n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Holly Paz requests that the Court award her the following \nrelief: \n(1) A declaration that Defendants IRS/Treasuryโs actions violated 5 U.S.C.  \nยงยง 552a(b) and/or (e)(6), and for each provision award monetary damages of not less than \n$1,000, the specific amount of which is to be determined at an evidentiary hearing;  \n  (2) Award of the costs of this action and reasonable attorney fees under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act or any other applicable law; and,     \n  (3) grant such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \nDate:  September 18, 2025 \n              Respectfully submitted, \n \n                   s/Mark S.
