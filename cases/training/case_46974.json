This case presents a challenge to Wisconsin laws that create and perpetuate a fossil fuel-\ndominated electricity sector which contributes to climate change, harms Plaintiffs, and infringes \non Plaintiffs’ inherent rights to life, liberty, and a stable climate system, guaranteed by Article I § \n1 of the Wisconsin Constitution, and the right to access, enjoy, and use public trust waters, \nguaranteed by Article I § 1 and Article IX § 1 of the Wisconsin Constitution. Plaintiffs challenge \nlaws that prohibit the Commission from considering or using air pollution as a basis for denying \npermits to new fossil fuel-fired power plants. Plaintiffs also challenge laws that set a ceiling on the \namount of renewable electricity generation the Commission can require electric providers to \nsupply, with no exceptions.  \n2.  Plaintiffs are children and youth between the ages of eight and seventeen, who have been \nand continue to be harmed by these laws. The laws perpetuate a fossil fuel-based electricity system; \ncause the emission of harmful air pollution, including climate-heating greenhouse gases (“GHG”); \nand obstruct Wisconsin’s transition to renewable energy, which is necessary to protect Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights. Given their age, Plaintiffs are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution and fossil \n \n1 Defendant Public Service Commission and Commissioners Summer Strand, Kristy Nieto, and \nMarcus Hawkins are referred to collectively as the “Commission” hereafter. \n  1 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 7 of 79\n \nfuel-caused climate change, which harm their physical and psychological health and safety, bodily \nintegrity, and degrade public trust resources they depend upon for their well-being and survival. \nYouth Plaintiffs face life-long hardships due to their ongoing exposure to air pollution, extreme \nweather events, and degradation of Wisconsin’s public trust resources. \n3.  Notwithstanding legislative and executive directives to state agencies to transition the \nelectricity sector to renewable energy sources (see infra ¶¶ 80-87), and Defendants’ longstanding \nknowledge of the dangers of air pollution and climate change, Defendants continue to make and \nimplement  laws  that  lock  in  an  electricity  system  powered  predominantly  by  fossil  fuels. \nWisconsin’s electricity sector is the largest source of Wisconsin’s GHG emissions, and thus the \nState’s single greatest contributor to the air pollution that is harming Plaintiffs and exacerbating \nclimate change.  \n4.  The Commission, through its implementation of the renewable portfolio standard and its \napproval authority of electricity generation, determines whether the State’s electricity comes from \nfossil fuels or renewable energy sources. Under the Commission’s control, coal and gas-fired \npower plants provide approximately 75% of Wisconsin’s electricity, while renewable energy \nresources provide only 17%. Defendants are on track to achieve, at most, 26% of Wisconsin’s \nelectricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2030, with the vast majority still coming \nfrom coal and gas.2 Wisconsin’s 2024 Emissions Reduction Roadmap admits the State is not on \ntrack to meet its GHG emission reduction targets.3 Nevertheless, the Commission continues to \n \n2 Public Service Commission, Strategic Energy Assessment 2024-2030, at 33-34 (Nov. 2024), \nhttps://apps.psc.wi.gov/ERF/ERFview/viewdoc.aspx?docid=523854.  \n3 Wisconsin Department of Administration, Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy, \nWisconsin Emissions Reduction Roadmap 14 (Mar. 1, 2024), https://www.wistatedocuments. \norg/digital/collection/p267601coll4/id/34490/. \n  2 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 8 of 79\n \napprove permits for new fossil fuel-fired power plants because the unconstitutional laws that \nPlaintiffs challenge constrain the Commission from doing otherwise. \n5.  Specifically, the laws that prohibit the Commission from considering air pollution when \ndeciding whether to approve or deny applications for a Certificate of Public Convenience and \nNecessity  (“CPCN”)  for  the  construction  of  electric  generation  facilities  (Wis.  Stat.  § \n196.491(3)(d)3. and 4.) violate Plaintiffs’ Article I § 1 constitutional rights to liberty (including \ntheir rights to health, safety, and bodily integrity) (Count I); to life (Count II); to a stable climate \nsystem (Count III); to access, enjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds (Count IV); and \nPlaintiffs’ Article IX § 1 constitutional right to public trust resources free from substantial \nimpairment (Count V). Plaintiffs allege that the prohibition on the consideration of air pollution in \nWis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4.4 is unconstitutional as applied to the Commission’s review of \nCPCNs for fossil fuel-powered electric generation facilities (i.e., fossil fuel-fired power plants) \nand should be enjoined from implementation during the Commission’s review of CPCNs for such \nfacilities. \n6.  Additionally, the statutory limitations on the Commission’s authority to impose renewable \nenergy development and procurement requirements on electric providers that exceed the level \nmandated by Wisconsin’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (“RPS”) (Wis. Stat. § 196.378(4m)(a) \nand Wis. Stat. § 196.025(1)(c)1.) violate Plaintiffs’ Article I § 1 constitutional rights to liberty \n \n4 Here, and in the remainder of the Complaint, references to Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4. \nrefer only to the last sentence of those subdivisions. Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. (“In its \nconsideration of environmental factors, the commission may not determine that the design and \nlocation or route is not in the public interest because of the impact of air pollution if the proposed \nfacility will meet the requirements of ch. 285.”); Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)4. (“In its \nconsideration of the impact on other environmental values, the commission may not determine \nthat the proposed facility will have an undue adverse impact on these values because of the \nimpact of air pollution if the proposed facility will meet the requirements of ch. 285.”). \n  3 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 9 of 79\n \n(including their rights to health, safety, and bodily integrity) (Count I); to life (Count II); to a stable \nclimate system (Count III); to access, enjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds (Count IV); \nand Plaintiffs’ Article IX § 1 constitutional right to public trust resources free from substantial \nimpairment  (Count  V).  Plaintiffs  allege  Wis.  Stat.  §  196.378(4m)(a)  and  Wis.  Stat.  § \n196.025(1)(c)1. are facially unconstitutional and should be enjoined from implementation in all \ncircumstances. \n7.  These laws perpetuate an electricity sector in Wisconsin dominated by fossil fuels and \nconstrain the Commission’s ability to procure more electricity from renewable energy sources \ninstead of fossil fuels. A declaration that the challenged laws violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nrights, and an injunction barring the Commission from implementing them, would eliminate a legal \nbarrier  to  reducing  air  pollution  from  Wisconsin’s  electricity  sector,  and  would  determine \nDefendants’ legal authority and obligations to decarbonize Wisconsin’s electricity sector.  \n8.  Each of the fifteen Plaintiffs is presently experiencing significant injuries from Defendants’ \nconduct that results in harmful air pollution and is exacerbating climate change, injuries that \nworsen with each additional ton of GHG emissions authorized by Defendants because of the laws \nchallenged herein.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Article VII § 8 of Wisconsin’s \nConstitution and Wis. Stat. § 753.03, which provide circuit courts with jurisdiction over all civil \nmatters within the State.  \n10.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  grant  declaratory  relief  under  Wisconsin’s  Uniform \nDeclaratory Judgments Act (“UDJA”), Wis. Stat. § 806.04, as well as its general equitable powers. \n  4 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 10 of 79\n \nPursuant to the UDJA, this Court “shall have power to declare rights, status, and other legal \nrelations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.”  \n11.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 801.50. The Commission and its \nCommissioners  perform  their  work  and  have  their  principal  place  of  business  in  Madison, \nWisconsin. The Legislature is seated and does its work in Madison, Wisconsin.  \nPARTIES \nI.  Plaintiffs \n12.  Kaarina Dunn is seventeen years old, lives in Onalaska, Wisconsin, and has deep family \nroots in the Mississippi River Valley and the Driftless Region. Kaarina used to live in Vernon \nCounty, but she was forced to move after two “100-year rain events” in the past ten years caused \nflooding, landslides, and erosion that damaged Kaarina’s family’s property, and threatened her \nsafety and home. In 2018, the road leading to her home and her driveway was washed out, blocking \nKaarina’s access to her home for two days. Kaarina’s family incurred over $5,000 in bills to repair \ntheir driveway. Then, in 2023, a massive boulder, dislodged by climate-driven freeze-thaw cycles, \ntumbled down the bluff above her house and into her backyard, toppling trees and raising new \nsafety concerns. Feeling unsafe in their home, Kaarina and her family made the hard decision to \nmove, but they could not find an affordable home in Vernon County that was not vulnerable to \nclimate-induced flooding. They were ultimately forced to move to La Crosse County to find a \nplace where they could safely live. Being displaced from her home and having to change schools \nwas a very disruptive and stressful experience for Kaarina. \n13.  Fishing and swimming on the Mississippi River is an important family tradition for \nKaarina, but floods now often block her access to the river. Summer floods routinely inundate her \ngrandparents’ property, blocking access to the dock Kaarina uses for river access. The frequency \n  5 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 11 of 79\n \nand magnitude of these floods are worse now than in the past. If Defendants’ conduct continues, \nKaarina’s ability to recreate on the river will decline further as flooding in the Mississippi River \nValley continues to increase in frequency and severity. \n14.  Kaarina often spends time in the summer working on her grandparents’ walnut tree farm in \nVernon County. However, extreme heat and increasingly common climate-fueled wildfire smoke \nmakes working there unsafe. Kaarina has suffered from heat exhaustion while working on the \nfarm. Extreme heat also drove Kaarina to quit her summer job teaching tennis. As temperatures \ncontinue to increase and wildfire smoke becomes more common due to Defendants’ conduct, the \nharm to Kaarina’s health will worsen and her ability to work and recreate outdoors will be further \nlimited.  \n15.  Since she was seven, Kaarina has been skiing with her family, and she now competes on \nher high school ski team. In recent years, Kaarina’s ability to ski has been limited by warmer winter \ntemperatures and less frequent snowfall due to climate change. Kaarina’s competitive ski season \nhas been shortened from twelve weeks to six to eight weeks. If Defendants’ conduct continues \nunchecked, Kaarina’s ability to ski and recreate in the winter will be further limited.  \n16.  Kaarina is committed to doing everything she can to reduce the dangers posed by climate \nchange in Wisconsin through practice and community education. Kaarina is the president of her \nlocal 4-H club, through which she won the Wisconsin KidWind Challenge, a hands-on competition \nwhere student teams build small-scale wind turbines and solar structure designs. Kaarina has been \nawarded three Bloomberg Philanthropies Climate Action Fund grants to reduce waste at youth \nsymphony concerts, restore a section of eroded shoreline in La Crosse, and plan and run a camp to \nteach youth how to live sustainably in the Driftless region.  \n  6 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 12 of 79\n \n17.  Caroline Elfstrom is an eight-year-old resident of Beloit, Wisconsin. Caroline is harmed \nby poor air quality due to air pollution from gas-fired power plants located near her home in Beloit. \nCaroline attends Todd Elementary School, which has one of the highest asthma rates in the Beloit \nschool district. As Caroline continues to live in the Beloit area, and the Commission continues to \napprove fossil fuel-fired power plants, the risk that she will develop asthma or experience other air \npollution-related  injuries  increases. Caroline  also  suffers  from  seasonal  allergies,  which  are \nexacerbated by climate change and Defendants’ conduct.  \n18.  Caroline is increasingly unable to go outside and play during the summer because extreme \nheat and humidity make it hard for her to breathe and are dangerous for her health. Smoke from \nwildfires has also forced Caroline to avoid playing outside. She feels trapped when forced indoors \nby extreme heat and smoke. School events have also been cancelled due to wildfire smoke. \nClimate-induced heat and smoke now regularly deprive Caroline of the ability to engage in outdoor \nactivities that are important for her health, happiness, and education. Lyme-disease carrying ticks, \nwhich are becoming more prevalent in Wisconsin due to rising temperatures, are also a growing \ndanger to Caroline’s health and safety, and she is now checked for ticks anytime she has been \nplaying outside.  \n19.  Caroline frequently swims and kayaks with her family on Wisconsin’s public trust waters, \nincluding Lake Chetek and Lake Warner. However, both lakes have increasingly experienced \nharmful algal blooms due to climate change that prevent Caroline from recreating on the lakes. \nWith ongoing air pollution authorized by the Commission, algal blooms will get worse, further \nlimiting Caroline’s access to and use of Wisconsin’s lakes. \n20.  Caroline has been attending climate events with her friends and family since she was two \nyears old and organized her own educational climate event at age four. Caroline has submitted \n  7 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 13 of 79\n \ncomments in several Commission proceedings opposing the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure, \nincluding the expansion of the Riverside Energy Plant in Beloit and the construction of a gas-fired \npower plant in Oak Creek. Her comment, expressed through an original drawing, inspired other \nyouth in the Oak Creek area to submit comments opposing the construction of the Oak Creek gas \nplant.   \n21.   \n22.  Tyler McClure age thirteen, Miahlin Behnke (Waazakone) age twelve, Athena Behnke \n(Mukademigwan) age ten, and Jayla Manthe (Gookoonz)5 age eight, are siblings who live in \nMilwaukee and attend the Indian Community School of Milwaukee located in Franklin. They are \nAnishinaabeg youth and members of the Indigenous community in Milwaukee (MinoAki). They \nhave the following tribal affiliations:  \n \n5 The youth’s tribal name is in parenthesis and is used hereafter. \n  8 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 14 of 79\n \na.  Tyler: Mescalero Apache, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead \nReservation, and Laguna Pueblo;  \nb.  Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz: Grand River Band of Ottawa Indians, \nLittle River Band of Ottawa Indian, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa \nIndians, Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians, and Lac du Flambeau Band \nof Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.  \nTyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz frequently travel to the Lac du Flambeau \nReservation and to the Ceded Territories in northern Wisconsin to fish, participate in cultural \nceremonies, and partake in other aspects of tribal life. Defendants’ conduct threatens many \nculturally significant activities, foods, and ways of life for Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and \nGookoonz. \n23.  Access to traditional foods of the Anishinaabeg diet, including wild rice, fish, and maple \nsugar, is essential to Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz’s connection to their \ntribes, cultural heritage and traditions, and to their health and happiness. All four children harvest \nmanoomin (wild rice) and are working to re-establish wild rice in waters in the Milwaukee area. \nIn the Anishinaabeg migration story, the Creator told Anishinaabe people to go to the place where \nthe food grows on water and so Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz’s ancestors \nmigrated to the Great Lakes where they found wild rice. Wild rice is a culturally and spiritually \nsignificant staple food for Anishinaabeg and has been for thousands of years. Rapidly changing \nwater levels in lakes, extreme rain events, and warming waters, all due to climate change, are \nharming wild rice beds, impairing the ability of Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz \nto harvest and eat wild rice.  \n24.  Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz harvest maple sugar (Anishinaabe \n  9 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 15 of 79\n \nzhiiwaagamizigan) by tapping sugar maple trees (ziinzibaakwadwaatig) as a family, as their tribes \nhave done for generations. Maple sugar is a traditional sweetener used instead of processed non-\nIndigenous sugars. In recent years, maple tapping has been extremely erratic, and the season is \nshorter because of early thaws and wildly fluctuating temperature changes in late winter and \nspring. Last year, the maple sap did not flow in the trees Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and \nGookoonz tapped, depriving them of a culturally important food source.  \n25.  Warming water temperatures harm Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz’s \nability to harvest fish such as walleye, muskellunge, and sturgeon depriving them of a traditional \nsource of protein. In the spring, they spear fish for walleye in Wisconsin’s public trust waters. \nWalleye is a cold-water fish and an important food for many Anishinaabe people. Warming water \ntemperatures due to climate change are causing declining walleye populations across the Ceded \nTerritories which limits Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz’s ability to catch and \neat these fish. Sturgeon is another culturally important fish and was traditionally a staple fish in \nthe Anishinaabe diet. Warming water temperatures due to climate change are depleting sturgeon \npopulations. Because of the low populations, Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz \ncan only harvest sturgeon for ceremonial purposes, not as a food source. If Defendants’ conduct \ncontinues unchecked, the opportunities for Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz to \nharvest walleye and sturgeon will continue to decline.  \n26.  Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz learned to spear muskellunge through \nthe ice from their father using traditional Anishinaabeg fishing methods. However, in recent years, \nice cover has not formed until late in the winter, limiting the ice fishing season and in turn limiting \ntheir access to foods they rely on. This past winter, Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and \nGookoonz were not able to ice fish until late January.  \n  10 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 16 of 79\n \n27.  Climate change is also limiting the opportunities for Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, \nand Gookoonz to sled, ski, and play a traditional Anishinaabeg winter game called Gooniikaa-\nGinebig Ataadiiwin (Snow Snake) where wooden poles are thrown down a grooved channel in the \nice or snow. Anishinaabe people have been holding community gatherings to play Snow Snake in \nMarch  since  well  before  Wisconsin’s  statehood.  In  recent  winters,  Tyler,  Waazakone, \nMukademigwan, and Gookoonz could not play Snow Snake because there was not enough snow \non the ground. Missing the opportunity to play Snow Snake deprives them of a chance to connect \nwith their community, family, and cultural heritage.   \n28.  In the summer, Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz spend most of their time \nswimming, kayaking, canoeing, surfing, and fishing on Lake Michigan and other nearby lakes. \nThey have been prevented from swimming in Lake Michigan due to harmful algal blooms, such \nas one that occurred on Lake Michigan while they were attending Racine Zoo Summer Camp. Low \nwater levels on the Milwaukee River due to the increasing occurrence of drought has also \nprevented  them  from  canoeing  or  kayaking  on  the  river  at  times.  Tyler,  Waazakone, \nMukademigwan, and Gookoonz’s use and enjoyment of Wisconsin’s public trust waters will be \nfurther infringed if Defendants’ conduct continues.  \n29.  Tyler,  Waazakone,  Mukademigwan,  and  Gookoonz  are  harmed  by  the  increasing \nprevalence of ticks in Wisconsin. In the past, they only worried about ticks when spending time in \nnorthern Wisconsin, but recently they have started checking for ticks whenever they are outside. \nIn  2023, Waazakone  contracted  Lyme  disease  from  a  tick  bite.  For  two  years, Waazakone \nexperienced swollen joints and could barely walk. Ticks continue to jeopardize Waazakone and \nher siblings’ safety and put them at risk of contracting Lyme disease or other vector-borne diseases.  \n30.  Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz all have seasonal allergies which are \n  11 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 17 of 79\n \nworsening due to climate change and Defendants’ conduct.  \n31.  Defendants’ conduct harms the mental health of Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and \nGookoonz because they know their ability to access traditional food sources and participate in \nculturally-important ceremonies will be further limited as climate change worsens, such that they \ncould be unable to carry on traditional ways of life in the future. The prospect of such losses is \ndevastating.  \n32.  Lucille Wright (Lucy) is a seventeen-year-old resident of Wausau, Wisconsin. Cross-\ncountry skiing provides a healthy form of recreation and a source of community for Lucy, who has \nbeen skiing since she could walk. Her family has been cross-country skiing for generations and \ncarrying on her family tradition is important for Lucy’s way of life. Lucy’s ability to ski and to \nstay connected to her family and community have been severely limited by warming winter \ntemperatures and declining winter snowfall due to climate change. Lucy grew up skiing on the \nthirty-kilometer trail network in Nine Mile County Forest Recreation area with her family and \nfriends and teaching younger athletes how to ski, but she has almost entirely lost her ability to ski \nthere due to lack of snow in recent years.  \n33.  Lucy competes in Nordic skiing as part of a local club team, but the lack of snow has \nseverely shortened her team’s ski season and forced Lucy’s team to drive two hours to access only \nfive kilometers of ski trails with artificial snow for ski practice. Lucy and her team have been \nforced to substantially extend their “dryland” season, having to run and roller-ski to prepare for \nski season, into the winter months due to the lack of snow. Lucy’s races are held more frequently \non courses with a thin cover of artificial snow which melts as hundreds of racers ski the track to \nexpose rocks and dirt. The exposed ground creates tripping hazards that can create a pileup of \nyoung ski racers, making her ski races more dangerous.  \n  12 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 18 of 79\n \n34.  Lucy has been competing in races at the American Birkebeiner (“Birkie”), a ski race \nfestival highlighted by a fifty-five kilometer ski race from Cable to Hayward, Wisconsin, since she \nwas in fifth grade. Lack of snow and unseasonably warm weather due to climate change has forced \nthe Birkie to rely on artificial snowmaking for the past two years and modify the course in 2017 \nand 2024, degrading Lucy’s experience participating in the race. If Defendants’ conduct continues, \nLucy’s ability to participate in this culturally significant race and connect with the intergenerational \nNordic ski community will be further limited.  \n35.  During the summers, Lucy is increasingly forced to stay inside and has had summer ski \npractices cancelled due to wildfire smoke. She also enjoys swimming in Wisconsin’s lakes but has \nbeen prevented from swimming due to harmful algal blooms.  \n36.  Defendants’ conduct is actively undermining Lucy’s ability to cross-country ski, train, and \nswim outdoors, activities that are central to her way of life, her health, and her happiness. If \nDefendants’ conduct continues unchecked, Lucy’s ability to engage in outdoor recreation activities \nwill further decline.  \n37.  Madeleine Bohn is a seventeen-year-old resident of Madison, Wisconsin. In the summer, \nMadeleine enjoys paddleboarding and swimming, but harmful algal blooms caused by warmer \nwater temperatures and intense rain events have prevented her from swimming and paddleboarding \non Wisconsin’s public trust waters, including Lake Wingra. Madeleine has asthma, and rising \ntemperatures and poor air quality due to wildfire smoke increasingly force Madeleine to stay inside \nto avoid asthma flare-ups, preventing her from biking, hiking, and running outdoors. In 2023, \nMadeleine’s summer gym class was cancelled due to dangerous wildfire smoke. Madeleine also \nsuffers from pollen allergies, which further force her to limit time spent outside. Madeleine’s \nallergy symptoms—sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes—have worsened in recent years and \n  13 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 19 of 79\n \nmake it difficult for her to focus in school. Madeleine’s health, safety, and ability to recreate outside \nwill be harmed further without action by Defendants to reduce air pollution from fossil fuel-fired \npower plants.  \n38.  Since she was young, it has been a family tradition for Madeleine to ice skate in the winter \non the neighborhood outdoor ice rinks and lakes in Madison. Because winters are warmer, ice is \nnot forming or melting quicker, resulting in Madeleine only being able to ice skate once or twice \na winter in recent years.   \n39.  Madeleine’s school has increasingly cancelled classes due to extreme weather events like \nextreme cold or icy conditions, limiting her access to important educational opportunities. Extreme \nrain events due to climate change have also increasingly flooded Madeleine’s basement, damaging \nher home and creating a mess that her family must clean up, which causes a financial and time \nburden on her family. \n40.  Madeleine experiences climate anxiety and fears for her own health and safety, and that of \nher community and future generations. She has missed school due to her mental health injuries \nand cannot participate in school sports. \n41.  Madeleine is committed to doing everything she can to minimize the dangers posed by \nclimate change. She is President of her school’s Green Club, a leader of the Madison chapter of \nthe Citizens’ Climate Lobby Youth Action Team, an organizer and moderator of the Dane County \nYouth Environmental Conference, and minimizes her own climate footprint.  \n42.  Isabella Black (Bella) is a sixteen-year-old resident of Hazelhurst, Wisconsin. Due to the \nsharp decline in snowfall in Minocqua, Bella’s family lost approximately $80,000 in the past two \nwinters because of cancelled reservations at her family’s lakeside resort, which is her family’s \nprimary source of income. The resort depends on year-round tourism to the Minocqua area for \n  14 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 20 of 79\n \ncross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling in the winter, and recreating on the lakes in \nthe summer. There has been so little snow that the ski and snowmobile trails at Minocqua Winter \nPark did not open for the 2023-2024 winter season and rarely opened for the 2024-2025 winter \nseason.  \n43.  As  a  result  of  more  extreme  and  destructive  weather  events,  Bella’s  family  spent \napproximately $35,000 to install generators to power their family home and business during power \noutages. In the summer months, increasing heat and the lack of air conditioning at Bella’s family \nresort now deters guests. Bella’s family cannot afford the $5,000 investment per air conditioner \nunit after losing so much revenue and spending money to install generators. Bella is harmed by \nher family’s loss of revenue as she relies on her family for financial support. If Defendants’ conduct \ncontinues unchecked, Bella’s family will continue to experience financial losses from reduced \ntourism, directly harming Bella.  \n44.  In summer of 2024, Bella contracted Lyme disease from a tick bite. Bella experienced \nintense nausea due to her Lyme disease, which caused her to lose twenty pounds over the course \nof a month. Her nausea has persisted in the past year, and she also developed alpha-gal syndrome, \na red meat allergy, from the tick bite. Ticks continue to jeopardize Bella’s safety and put her at risk \nof contracting other vector-borne diseases. \n45.  Bella cross-country skis to stay active and spend time with her family, but extremely low \nsnowfall has caused Bella to lose this avenue for recreation and family bonding, forcing her to stay \ninside more. Her ability to ski in the future will be further limited if Defendants’ conduct continues. \n46.  Bella’s health suffers from spring pollen allergies, which are worsening due to Defendants’ \nconduct to exacerbate climate change. She often wakes up in the morning with her eyes swollen \nand crusted shut and she has trouble breathing throughout the day.  \n  15 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 21 of 79\n \n47.  Bella experiences climate anxiety because she knows that however bad the injuries she has \nalready suffered are, they will get worse if the Commission keeps approving new fossil fuel-fired \npower  plants.  Bella  has  a  passion  for  environmental  issues  and  has  participated  in  school \nenvironmental clubs since elementary school.  \n48.  Ted Schultz-Becker is fifteen years old and lives in Athens, Wisconsin. Ted works on \nboth of his parents’ organic vegetable farms, which are his family’s primary source of income. Ted \nis the fourth generation to live and work on his father’s family farm.  \n49.  Increasingly inconsistent rainfall and more frequent extreme weather events, including \nheavy rainfall, hail, wind, and drought events have made growing vegetables more challenging for \nTed and his family. Intermittent drought conditions have forced Ted and his family to rely more \nheavily on irrigation on the farms. Ted’s mother spent approximately $10,000 to drill and install a \nnew well to ensure adequate water for irrigation. There are also increased labor costs and efforts \nincurred from the inconsistent rainfall because moving irrigation equipment around the farm \ncreates hours of extra labor each day on the farms. Extreme rain events, hailstorms, high wind \nevents, and drought increasingly damage crops on both of Ted’s parents’ farms resulting in lost \nrevenue.  \n50.  Ted is harmed by increasing operating costs and lost revenue of his parents’ farms, as he \nrelies on his parents for economic support. If Defendants’ conduct continues unchecked, economic \nlosses to Ted’s family will continue to worsen as rainfall becomes increasingly unpredictable, \nextreme weather events become more frequent and severe, and drought conditions worsen, \nexacerbating Ted’s financial insecurities. Ted wants to pursue vegetable farming for his own \nlivelihood, but climate change is undermining his family’s way of life and making it financially \nriskier.  \n  16 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 22 of 79\n \n51.  Farm work must get done regardless of air quality, and Ted increasingly finds himself \nworking on the farm when the air is thick with wildfire smoke, harming his health. Additionally, \nTed’s ability to compete in football and track and field at school has been limited due to extreme \nheat and poor air quality from climate change. Cross-country practices have been cancelled \nbecause of smoke, and football practices have moved inside instead of playing outdoors during \nextreme heat. Rising temperatures and poor air quality are depriving Ted of opportunities for \noutdoor recreation that are important for his health, happiness, and well-being. \n52.  Since he was very young, Ted has gone canoeing, swimming, and fishing for trout on the \nRib River, near his home, and Baldwin Creek, which runs through his farm. Increasing water \ntemperatures on Baldwin Creek and the Rib River have led to a decline in trout runs, limiting Ted’s \nability to fish. Low water levels on the Rib River, which are increasingly common due to climate-\ninduced drought conditions, have also prevented Ted from canoeing on the river and accessing his \nnormal fishing spots. If Defendants’ conduct continues, Ted’s ability to fish and recreate on \nWisconsin’s public trust waterways will be further impaired.  \n53.  The tick season is longer than it used to be and Ted often picks ticks off himself after being \noutdoors. Given the rising prevalence of Lyme-disease carrying ticks, Ted’s health and safety is at \nrisk from increasing tick populations. \n54.  Charles Breitenmoser (Charlie) is seventeen years old and lives in Merrill, Wisconsin. \nCharlie has been working on his family’s 460-cow dairy farm, which is his family’s main source \nof income, since he was eight years old. Increasingly extreme precipitation events and inconsistent \nrainfall have made growing cattle feed more challenging for Charlie and his family. Unpredictable \nrainfall has shortened the suitable weather window for planting while increasingly common \nextreme rain events have required Charlie and his family to invest time and money in planting \n  17 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 23 of 79\n \ncover crops and vegetative buffers to prevent topsoil erosion. Extreme rainfall has made some \nplots too wet to grow feed or decreased the crude protein content in the feed, forcing Charlie’s \nfamily to purchase additional feed and protein to properly nourish their cows, something they did \nnot have to do until recently.  \n55.  During winter months, all the heifers on the farm used to stay clean and warm outside \nlaying on the frozen ground through the winter. In recent years, with warming winter temperatures, \nthe ground has started to thaw during the winter causing it to become muddy and unsuitable for \nthe cows to lay on. Because of this, Charlie’s family had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars \nbuilding an additional barn to house their heifers in the winter. The increased costs of running the \nfarm, and lost revenue, directly harm Charlie because he depends on his family for economic \nsupport. Charlie’s economic injuries will worsen in the coming years if Defendants’ conduct \ncontinues.  \n56.  Charlie has been attending Wisconsin Farmers Union Kamp Kenwood since he was eight \nyears old where he enjoys swimming in Lake Wissota. In recent years, Charlie has not been able \nto swim in Lake Wissota due to the increase of blue-green algae. Charlie’s ability to access, enjoy, \nand use Wisconsin’s public trust waters will be further impaired if Defendants’ conduct continues. \n57.  Charlie serves as a youth leader in the farming community as a member of the Wisconsin \nFarmers Union Senior Youth Advisory Council (“SYAC”). Charlie’s family uses solar panels on \ntheir farm for electricity, grows their cows’ feed, and takes steps to reduce methane emissions from \ntheir cattle. \n58.  Elia Masrour is an eleven-year-old resident of Madison, Wisconsin. In the summer, Elia \nloves swimming and playing in Wisconsin’s public trust waters, including Lakes Mendota, \nMonona, and Wingra in the Madison area. However, harmful algal blooms have prevented Elia \n  18 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 24 of 79\n \nfrom swimming in or recreating near Wisconsin’s lakes and enjoying their scenic beauty. Elia \nsuffers from migraines and has had to miss multiple days of summer camp because increasingly \ncommon extreme heat exacerbates his risk of suffering a migraine. These headaches cause Elia \nextreme pain and force him to rest and recover at home. Elia has missed outdoor recess and been \nforced to stay inside during the summer many times due to unhealthy air quality from wildfire \nsmoke. If Defendants’ conduct continues unchecked, Elia’s ability to recreate and exercise outside \nand swim in Wisconsin’s lakes will be further limited and his risk of migraines will increase.  \n59.  Elia  loves  recreating  in  the  snow  and  ice  skating  with  friends  and  family  but  his \nopportunities to do so are declining due to warming winter temperatures and reduced snowpack, \nwhich cause ice to form later and melt lakes, ponds, and neighborhood ice rinks earlier. As a result \nof less snow and ice in the winter, Elia is deprived of an outdoor recreation opportunity important \nto his health and happiness. Elia’s ability to recreate with family and friends in the snow and to ice \nskate will be further limited without reductions in air pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants. \n60.  Elia’s family has invested over $10,000 to protect their house from extreme precipitation \nevents and increased flooding dangers due to climate change. Elia is dependent on his family for \nfinancial support and his parents’ increased cost of housing directly impacts Elia. The costs to \nprotect his home will increase if Defendants’ conduct continues.  \n61.  Unseasonably warm winter temperatures, extreme rainstorms, and tornado warnings cause \nElia to feel distressed and anxious. Heavy rainstorms have woken Elia up in the middle of the \nnight, disrupting his sleep and making him anxious about the future.  \n62.  Alexander Castillo (Alex) is a seventeen-year-old resident of Middleton, Wisconsin. Alex \nplays competitive soccer on school and club teams, and trains throughout the year. Alex is \nincreasingly forced to train and practice in extreme heat and air polluted with wildfire smoke. Air \n  19 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 25 of 79\n \npollution from the West Campus Co-Generation Facility, a natural gas plant near Alex’s home, also \npollutes the air Alex breathes. Playing soccer through extreme heat causes Alex to experience \nsymptoms of heat exhaustion like extreme fatigue and headaches. Playing soccer and training in \nextreme heat and wildfire smoke jeopardizes Alex’s health and puts him at risk of heat exhaustion, \nheat stroke, and respiratory illness. Such risks to Alex’s health increase with each additional \nincrement of heating resulting from ongoing air pollution authorized by Defendants’ conduct. \n63.  Alex enjoys swimming, boating, and spending time with friends and family on Lake \nMendota in the summer. The increasing occurrence of harmful algal blooms on Lake Mendota, \nwhich are worsening due to Defendants’ conduct, has prevented Alex from swimming and \nenjoying the aesthetic beauty of the lake. Alex’s ability to swim, boat, and enjoy the beauty of Lake \nMendota and Wisconsin’s public trust waters will be further limited without action by Defendants \nto reduce air pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants. \n64.  In the winter, Alex downhill skis at Devil’s Head and Tyrol Basin and ice skates on the \nlakes in the Madison area. In recent years, Alex has had fewer opportunities to ski and ice skate \nbecause there is significantly less snowfall, and lake ice forms later and melts earlier due to climate \nchange. His ability to ski and ice skate in the future will be limited further if Defendants’ conduct \ncontinues, depriving Alex of activities important to his health, happiness, and well-being. \n65.   Extreme weather events have damaged Alex’s home. A severe hailstorm caused about \n$20,000 of damage to the roof of Alex’s family home, approximately $5,000 of which Alex’s \nfamily had to pay out of pocket. If Defendants’ conduct continues unchecked, extreme weather \nevents will continue to pose a threat to Alex’s family home and property and cause more financial \nlosses.  \n  20 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 26 of 79\n \n66.  Simon Besonen is a seventeen-year-old resident of Viroqua, Wisconsin. Simon has had \nasthma since he was a child. In summer 2023, unhealthy air quality from climate-induced wildfire \nsmoke exacerbated Simon’s asthma symptoms forcing him to limit his time spent outdoors and to \nwear a face mask when he did go outside in the smoke. Simon and his family also utilized air \npurifiers in the house to protect him from the smoke. As the air quality in Wisconsin gets even \nworse as a result of fossil fuel air pollution authorized by Defendants, Simon will continue to have \nto limit time outdoors and purchase face masks to protect his health from air pollution. \n67.  Simon’s health and well-being have been harmed by the increasing summer heat. At his \ndad’s house, the only source of air conditioning is a window unit in the living room. Temperatures \nregularly rise high enough that Simon is forced to spend most of his time near the air conditioning. \nAt night, Simon has had a hard time sleeping because of how hot it is and cannot sleep without the \nfan he added to his bedroom. During the day, heat often causes Simon to limit his time recreating \noutside. \n68.  Simon enjoys cold plunging and spending time outside in the snow in the winter. Less \nwinter snowfall and warmer winter days have decreased Simon’s opportunities to recreate in the \nsnow. Simon is troubled by declining snowfall and rapidly fluctuating winter weather, which he \nrecognizes as a sign of how climate change impacts will continue to worsen in the future if \nDefendants continue to approve permits for new fossil fuel-fired power plants.  \n69.  Simon has been engaged in climate activities since he was a child, including participating \nin a cross-country climate march when he was four years old. In fourth grade, Simon participated \nin the youth-led Fridays for Future climate rallies, to raise awareness about the dangers of climate \nchange. Simon is determined to hold his government accountable for its actions that increase fossil \nfuel air pollution and make climate change worse. \n  21 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 27 of 79\n \n70.  Auden Gresch (Indy) is a fifteen-year-old resident of Madison, Wisconsin. Indy suffers \nfrom asthma which has been exacerbated by wildfire smoke and air pollution from fossil fuel-fired \npower plants. Poor air quality aggravates Indy’s asthma symptoms making everyday activities \nmore difficult. During the wildfires throughout the summer of 2025, the Air Quality Index in \nMadison remained in a range unhealthy for those with asthma for weeks at a time, and Indy was \nforced to stay inside. As a result, Indy missed out on recreational activities and his physical \neducation class, which are important for his health and happiness. Indy experiences wheezing and \ndifficulty breathing whenever he visits his grandmother in Wausau because of air pollution from \nthe Weston coal-fired power plant. If Defendants’ conduct continues unchecked, Indy’s health and \nsafety will be further harmed.  \n71.  In the winter, Indy enjoys skiing and snowboarding, an activity he has been doing with his \nfamily since he was five years old. However, the lack of snow reduces Indy’s ability to engage in \nthese winter recreation activities. Indy’s ability to ski and snowboard, which are important family \nactivities and part of Indy’s overall health and happiness, will be further limited without reductions \nin air pollution from Defendants. \n72.  In the summers, Indy and his family regularly swim, canoe, and kayak at Pickerel Lake. In \nrecent years, Indy has noticed that the Eurasian watermilfoil, which spreads rapidly in the warming \nlake, has grown so out of control that his ability to swim and recreate in the lake has become \nlimited. Indy’s family owns a family cottage near Pickerel Lake, which they rent out in the winter. \nRecently however, there has been a dramatic decrease in their rental income due to the lack of \nwinter snowpack, which is the primary draw for winter visitors. The cottage does not have air \nconditioning  because  it  was  not  needed  in  the  past,  but  now,  the  extreme  heat  makes  it \nuncomfortably hot for Indy when visiting the cabin.  \n  22 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 28 of 79\n \nII.  Defendants \n73.  Defendant Public Service Commission of Wisconsin is an independent agency of the \nState of Wisconsin. The Commission supervises and regulates every public utility in the State of \nWisconsin and has jurisdiction to do all things necessary and convenient to its jurisdiction. Public \nutilities receive indeterminate permits from the Commission, granting them the authority to own, \noperate, manage, or control power plants and equipment for the production, transmission, delivery, \nor furnishing of public utility services in Wisconsin. The Commission’s grant of an indeterminate \npermit guarantees the public utility monopoly status within its service territory. \n74.  In exercising its regulatory authority, the Commission determines whether Wisconsin’s \nelectricity comes from fossil fuel sources or renewable energy sources.  \n75.  The Commission has a duty to consider applications and make decisions about whether to \nissue CPCNs for the construction of electric generating facilities under the Plant Siting Law (Wis. \nStat. § 196.491). \n76.  No person may build new large electric generating facilities6 in Wisconsin without a CPCN \nfrom the Commission.  \n77.  The  Commission  has  a  duty  to  implement  and  monitor  electric  service  providers’ \ncompliance with Wisconsin’s RPS (Wis. Stat. § 196.378 and Wis. Stat. § 196.025). \n78.  Defendants Summer Strand, Kristy Nieto, and Marcus Hawkins are the three Public \nService Commissioners. Commissioners Strand, Nieto, and Hawkins decide cases brought before \nthe Commission, and decide whether to issue CPCNs. Commissioners Strand, Nieto, and Hawkins \nare each sued in their official capacity.  \n \n6 “Large electric generating facility” means electric generating equipment and associated \nfacilities designed for nominal operation at a capacity of 100 megawatts or more. Wis. Stat. § \n196.491(1)(g). \n  23 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 29 of 79\n \n79.  Defendant Wisconsin State Legislature is a sovereign trustee over the public trust \nresources within its domain, including all navigable waters. The Legislature is charged with \npreserving, promoting, and protecting the public’s rights in navigable waters for the benefit of \npresent and future Wisconsinites. The Legislature is empowered to enact laws to protect public \ntrust resources. The Legislature cannot act in a manner that infringes upon Plaintiffs’ public trust \nrights under Article IX § 1 of the Wisconsin State Constitution. The Legislature is only a defendant \nfor the public trust claim asserted under Article IX § 1 (Count V).  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  Wisconsin’s Legislative and Executive Branches Have Decided to Decarbonize \nthe State’s Electricity Sector. \n \n80.  For decades, the State of Wisconsin has known that burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, \nincluding GHG emissions, resulting in various harms to the public interest, including adverse \nenvironmental effects. The State of Wisconsin has known that a reduction in, and eventual \nelimination of, GHG emissions is necessary and would minimize the dangers.  \n81.  Over thirty years ago, in 1993, the Wisconsin Legislature enacted a State Energy Policy \nestablishing that all new electricity generation in the State be renewable energy resources, to the \nextent cost effective and technically feasible. The State Energy Policy also orders agencies to “rely \nto the greatest extent feasible on energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy resources, \nif [they] are cost effective and technically feasible and do not have unacceptable environmental \nimpacts” in designing all new and replacement energy projects.7 The bill was motivated in part by \n \n7 Wis. Stat. § 1.12(5)(a). \n  24 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 30 of 79\n \na need to “reduce the environmental effects of energy systems powered by carbon-based . . . \nfuels.”8 \n82.  The 1993 State Energy Policy includes an energy priorities list. Fossil fuels are the last \npriority on the energy priorities list, below energy conservation and efficiency and renewable \nenergy resources. \n83.  In 1999, Wisconsin adopted its first RPS. Wisconsin amended its RPS in 2005 to set a \nstatewide goal that 10% of all electric energy consumed in the State come from renewable energy \nsources by 2015. Wisconsin met the statewide goal in 2013. \n84.  In April 2007, Governor Jim Doyle created the Governor’s Task Force on Global Warming \nthrough Executive Order 191. In 2008, the Task Force made various policy recommendations to \ndecarbonize Wisconsin’s electricity sector and encourage renewable energy development. \n85.  In August 2019, Governor Evers signed Executive Order 38, which created the Office of \nSustainability and Clean Energy, and charged the Office, in partnership with state agencies and \nutilities, with ensuring that all electricity consumed within the State of Wisconsin be 100% carbon \nfree by 2050. In October 2019, Governor Evers signed Executive Order 52, establishing the \nGovernor’s Task Force on Climate Change. \n86.  In 2020, the State of Wisconsin published the Governor’s Task Force on Climate Change \nReport, which found that “Wisconsin cannot take meaningful climate action without bold action \nto reduce the use of fossil fuels and pivot to renewable energy.”  \n \n8 1993 Wis. Act 414, Prefatory Note, https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/1993/related/acts/414. \n  25 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 31 of 79\n \n87.  The Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy released Wisconsin’s first Clean Energy \nPlan in April 2022 and declared its objectives to put Wisconsin on a path toward a 100% carbon-\nfree electric system by 2050 to protect human and environmental health by reducing air pollution.9  \nII.  Renewable Energy Sources Are Technically and Economically Feasible to Meet \nWisconsin’s Current and Future Energy Needs, but the Challenged Laws Are a \nBarrier to Decarbonization.  \n \n88.  It is technically and economically feasible for Wisconsin to meet its target of achieving \n100% carbon free electricity no later than 2050. Wisconsin’s current and future needs for adequate \nand reliable electricity—indeed, all its energy needs (i.e., electricity, transportation, residential, \nindustry, and commercial sectors)—can be met with 100% renewable energy sources—primarily \nwind and solar—as soon as 2035.10  \n89.  No additional fossil fuel infrastructure, including fossil fuel-fired generating infrastructure, \nis necessary to meet Wisconsin’s current or future electricity needs.  \n90.  Wind and solar are the cheapest forms of electricity today. Battery storage is also cost-\neffective and, when used with renewable energy, effectively balances supply and demand and \nimproves overall grid stability.  \n91.  Transitioning to 100% renewable energy would result in over $300 in annual energy costs \nsavings per Wisconsin resident, avoid $7.11 billion in health costs per year, and create nearly \n85,000 jobs.11 \n \n9 Wisconsin Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy, Clean Energy Plan 7 (Apr. 2022) \nhttps://osce.wi.gov/Documents/SOW-CleanEnergyPlan2022.pdf.  \n10 The Solutions Project, 100% Wisconsin, https://thesolutionsproject.org/what-we-do/inspiring-\naction/why-clean-energy/ - /map/states/location/WI (last visited Aug. 15, 2025); Mark Jacobson, \nZero Air Pollution and Zero Carbon From All Energy Without Blackouts at Low Cost in \nWisconsin (Dec. 7, 2021), https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/21-USStates-\nPDFs/21-WWS-Wisconsin.pdf.  \n11 Id. \n  26 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 32 of 79\n \n92.  Achieving a transition to 100% renewable electricity in Wisconsin by no later than 2050, \nand as soon as 2035, is cost-effective, technically feasible, and consistent with protecting Plaintiffs \nfrom the most catastrophic and irreversible climate impacts.  \nIII.  The Challenged Laws Operate as an Unconstitutional Barrier to the \nDecarbonization of Wisconsin’s Electricity Sector and a Violation of Plaintiffs’ \nConstitutional Rights. \n \nA.  Plant Siting Law – Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4. \n93.  The Commission has a duty to review all applications for CPCNs to construct new large \nelectric generating facilities in Wisconsin and only approves such applications when certain \nstatutory criteria are met. No person may commence the construction of a new large electric \ngenerating facility (“proposed facility”) without a CPCN from the Commission.  \n94.  The Commission is forbidden from considering air pollution, including the GHGs that \ndrive climate change, in its evaluation of two criteria that must be fulfilled for the Commission to \napprove an application for a CPCN.  \n95.  First, before issuing a CPCN, the Commission must determine the proposed facility’s \n“design and location or route is in the public interest considering alternative sources of supply, \nalternative locations or routes, individual hardships, engineering, economic, safety, reliability, and \nenvironmental factors.” Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. The Commission is the only agency that \nmakes this substantive public interest finding. In making its public interest determination, the \nCommission “may not determine that the design and location or route is not in the public interest \nbecause of the impact of air pollution if the proposed facility will meet the requirements of ch. \n285.” Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3.  \n96.  Second, before issuing a CPCN, the Commission must determine that “[t]he proposed \nfacility will not have undue adverse impact on other environmental values such as, but not limited \n  27 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 33 of 79\n \nto,  ecological  balance,  public  health  and  welfare,  historic  sites,  geological  formations,  the \naesthetics of land and water and recreational use.” Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)4. The Commission \nis the only agency that makes this substantive determination of undue adverse environmental \nimpact.  However,  “[i]n  its  consideration  of  the  impact  on  other  environmental  values,  the \ncommission may not determine that the proposed facility will have an undue adverse impact on \nthese  values  because  of  the  impact  of  air  pollution  if  the  proposed  facility  will  meet  the \nrequirements of ch. 285.” Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)4. \n97.   Chapter  285  charges  Wisconsin’s  Department  of  Natural  Resources  (“DNR”)  with \nconducting various environmental reviews and issuing air pollution control permits for proposed \npower plants. However, DNR does not make findings about whether a proposed facility’s design \nand  location  are  in  the  “public  interest”  or  will  have  an  “undue  adverse  impact  on  other \nenvironmental values,” as the Commission is required to do. When issuing air pollution permits, \nchapter 285 limits DNR’s consideration of GHG emissions to the extent the federal Clean Air Act \nrequires, which is extremely limited. The DNR does not deny air pollution permits on the basis of \na project’s GHG emissions.  \n98.  Under the Plant Siting Law, Wis. Stat. § 196.491, the Commission is required to deny an \napplication for a CPCN if issuing the CPCN is not in the “public interest” or would have an “undue \nadverse impact on other environmental values,” regardless of whether DNR has issued any permits \nfor the proposed project. However, Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4. single out air pollution as \ndistinct from all other environmental impacts that are subject to permitting decisions made by DNR \nand prohibit the Commission from denying a CPCN to a proposed fossil fuel-fired power plant \nbecause of concerns related to air pollution, including GHG emissions.  \n  28 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 34 of 79\n \n99.  Even if the Commission determines that air pollution from a proposed facility would render \nthe  project  contrary  to  the  “public  interest,”  cause  an  “undue  adverse  impact  on  other \nenvironmental values,” or harm “public health and welfare” the Commission is prohibited from \ndenying a CPCN application on this basis. Commissioner Strand has acknowledged that the \nCommission is prohibited from denying new electricity generation projects over air pollution \nconcerns. \n100.  The Governor’s Task Force on Climate Change has stated that because of Wis. Stat. § \n196.491(3)(d)3., the Commission does not consider GHG emissions, or the ability of utilities to \nmeet their 2030 and 2050 GHG emission reduction goals when evaluating proposed fossil fuel-\nfired power plants. \n101.  Declaring Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4. unconstitutional would remove a barrier to \nthe Commission’s ability to deny a fossil fuel-fired power plant’s application for a CPCN on the \nbasis that its design or location is not in the “public interest” because of its air pollution, including \nGHG emissions. It would also remove a barrier to the Commission’s ability to deny a fossil fuel-\nfired power plant’s application for a CPCN on the basis that the proposed facility’s air pollution \nwill  have  an  “undue  adverse  impact  on  other  environmental  values,”  including  impacts  to \n“ecological balance, public health and welfare.” \n102.  The Commission knows that permitting fossil fuel-fired power plants is harmful to the \n“public interest,” including youth Plaintiffs, has an “undue adverse impact on other environmental \nvalues,” including “ecological balance, public health and welfare,” and is contrary to the State’s \ncommitment to decarbonize the electricity sector no later than 2050. Therefore, upon information \nand belief, the effect of declaring Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4. unconstitutional is that the \n  29 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 35 of 79\n \nCommission would deny CPCNs for fossil fuel-fired power plants in favor of renewable energy \nresources.  \n103.  The denial of CPCNs for fossil fuel-fired power plants would reduce air pollution from \nfossil fuel-fired power plants, thereby alleviating Plaintiffs’ current climate and air pollution-\nrelated injuries, and minimizing their risk of future injuries.  \nB.  Renewable Portfolio Standard – Wis. Stat. § 196.378(4m)(a) and Wis. Stat. \n§ 196.025(1)(c)1. \n \n104.  Wisconsin’s RPS, as amended in 2005, set a statewide goal that 10% of all electricity \nconsumed in the State come from renewable energy sources by 2015. \n105.  The RPS also established requirements for electric providers to drive their development \nand procurement of renewable energy sources, as necessary to meet the statewide goal. \n106.  Two related laws prevent the Commission from requiring electric providers to build or \npurchase electricity from renewable energy sources beyond what is required to meet the statewide \ngoal of 10% renewable electricity. These laws cap how much renewable energy the Commission \ncan require electric providers to build or purchase, thereby constraining the Commission’s ability \nto decarbonize the electricity sector. \n107.  Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 196.378(4m)(a), the Commission cannot require any electric \nprovider to increase its percentage of renewable energy generation above the required level set \nforth in the RPS.  \n108.  Pursuant  to Wis.  Stat.  §  196.025(1)(c)1.,  the  Commission  cannot  impose  additional \nrenewable energy requirements on any investor-owned electric utility if Wisconsin has met the \nstatewide RPS goal and the utility has otherwise complied with its electric provider requirements. \n109.  Because Wisconsin electric providers have collectively met the statewide RPS goal—that \n10% of all electricity consumed in the State come from renewable energy sources—every year \n  30 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 36 of 79\n \nsince 2013, the Commission has been prohibited from requiring electric providers to build or \npurchase additional renewable electricity since 2013.  \n110.  Wis. Stat. § 196.378(4m)(a) and Wis. Stat. § 196.025(1)(c)1. restrict the Commission’s \nability to impose obligations to provide additional renewable energy when a utility has met the \nRPS requirements. Wis. Stat. § 196.378(4m)(a) and Wis. Stat. § 196.025(1)(c)1. have transformed \nWisconsin’s RPS into a ceiling that caps how much renewable energy the Commission can require \nelectric providers to build or purchase. \n111.  Consistent  with  this  statutory  constraint,  the  Commission  has  not  required  electric \nproviders to increase their development or procurement of renewable energy sources.  \n112.  The Commission has a statutory mandate to ensure there is an adequate and reliable supply \nof electricity in Wisconsin. However, under current law, if electric providers continue proposing \nto build more fossil fuel-fired power plants (which they are doing)12 and electric providers’ existing \nrenewable energy sources cannot supply enough electricity to meet growing electricity demands \n(which is true),13 the Commission has no authority to require electric providers to build or purchase \nrenewable electricity to meet the demand. Instead, the Commission is compelled to continue \napproving fossil fuel-fired power plants to ensure an adequate and reliable supply of electricity.  \n113.  Declaring Wis. Stat. § 196.378(4m)(a) and Wis. Stat. § 196.025(1)(c)1. unconstitutional \nwould remove a barrier that currently prevents the Commission from requiring electric providers \nto build or purchase electricity from renewable energy sources, as necessary to meet the State’s \ngrowing demand, and remove a barrier to requiring more renewable energy sources. \n \n12 Public Service Commission, Strategic Energy Assessment 2024-2030, at 2. \n13 Id. at 1,14 (demand for electricity is projected to increase by 14.8% from 2024 through 2030).  \n  31 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 37 of 79\n \n114.  Given Wisconsin’s commitment to decarbonize its electricity sector no later than 2050, \nupon information and belief, the effect of declaring Wis. Stat. § 196.378(4m)(a) and Wis. Stat. § \n196.025(1)(c)1. unconstitutional is that the Commission would require electric providers to meet \nWisconsin’s current and growing electricity demand with electricity from new renewable energy \nsources, instead of new fossil fuel energy sources. This would increase the share of electricity \ngenerated from renewable energy sources, decrease the share of electricity generated from fossil \nfuels, and reduce air pollution—thereby alleviating Plaintiffs’ current climate and air pollution-\nrelated injuries, and minimizing their risk of future injuries. \n115.  Such an outcome would occur because renewable energy sources are cost-effective and \ntechnically feasible to meet growing demand for electricity, can provide an adequate and reliable \nsupply of electricity, and do not exacerbate climate change. Ensuring that Wisconsin meets its \ncurrent and growing electricity demand with electricity from new renewable energy sources would \nachieve  compliance  with  State  Energy  Policy,  Executive  Order  38,  and  the  Commission’s \nconstitutional obligations to Plaintiffs.  \n* * * \n116.  The challenged laws, Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4., Wis. Stat. § 196.378(4m)(a), and \nWis. Stat. § 196.025(1)(c)1., violate Plaintiffs’ inherent rights protected by Article 1 § 1 and public \ntrust rights protected by Article IX § 1 by requiring the Commission to disregard air pollution from \nfossil fuel-fired power plants—a known threat to Plaintiffs’ lives, health, safety, happiness, and the \npublic trust resources they depend on. The challenged laws cannot be reconciled with Defendants’ \nobligation to decarbonize Wisconsin’s electricity sector no later than 2050, as the protection of \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights requires. On the contrary, these laws, individually and collectively \nensure the continuation of the Commission’s pattern and practice of approving CPCNs for fossil \n  32 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 38 of 79\n \nfuel-fired power plants, prevent the Commission from satisfying its constitutional obligations to \nprotect Plaintiffs from harmful air pollution, and are a barrier to the Commission’s ability to \ndecarbonize Wisconsin’s electricity sector. \n117.  Without these laws, upon information and belief, the Commission would deny CPCNs for \nnew fossil fuel-fired power plants based on their harmful air pollution and mandate an increase in \nelectricity generation from renewable energy sources, thereby decreasing air pollution from fossil \nfuel-fired power plants and minimizing and alleviating Plaintiffs’ current and future climate and \nair pollution-related injuries. \nIV.  The Commission’s Permitting of Fossil Fuel-Fired Power Plants Has \nPerpetuated an Electricity System Dominated by Fossil Fuels in Wisconsin.  \n \n118.  The challenged laws ensure that Wisconsin’s electricity sector remains dominated by fossil \nfuels. Moreover, the Commission continues to approve new fossil fuel-fired power plants, and \nWisconsin is not on track to decarbonize the electricity sector by 2050.  \n119.  In 2023, only 17% of total retail sales of electricity (i.e., electricity consumed by end users) \nin Wisconsin came from renewable resources.14 Renewable energy resources provided only 9% of \nWisconsin’s in-state electricity net generation.15  \n120.  Fossil fuel-fired power plants dominate electricity generation in Wisconsin, providing \napproximately 75% of Wisconsin’s electricity generation. Fossil fuel-fired power plants burn fossil \nfuels including coal, oil, and gas, thereby causing air pollution, including GHG emissions, which \nexacerbates the climate crisis and Plaintiffs’ injuries.   \n \n14 Public Service Commission, Report on the Impacts of the Renewable Portfolio Standard 7 \n(July 1, 2024), https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/mandatedreports/2024/public_service_ \ncommission/report_on_the_impacts_of_the_renewable_portfolio_standard_s_196_378_4r_recei\nved_6_28_2024.pdf. \n15 U.S. Energy Information Administration, Wisconsin State Profile and Energy Estimates \n(updated Sept. 19, 2024), https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=WI.  \n  33 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 39 of 79\n \n121.  Wisconsin electric utilities still have seven utility-scale coal-fired power plants currently \noperating with a combined capacity of nearly 2800 MW. The newest coal-fired power plant, Elm \nRoad Generating Station, became operational in 2010. The Commission granted a CPCN to \nWisconsin Electric Corporation to build this 1830 megawatt (“MW”) coal-fired power plant in \n2003. \n122.  Wisconsin’s electricity sector is increasingly reliant on gas imported from other states and \ncountries. Between 2010 and 2023, there was a five-fold increase in the use of gas in the electricity \nsector. The use of gas in the electricity sector is projected to continue to grow through at least 2030. \n123.  Upon information and belief, the Commission has issued at least seventeen CPCNs for gas-\nfired power plants since 1993, for a combined capacity of approximately 5300 MW currently \noperational and an additional 1128 MW of new capacity approved in May 2025.  \n124.  Upon information and belief, the Commission has only denied one application for a CPCN \nfor a proposed fossil fuel-fired power plant in its recorded history—solely on the basis of cost. \n125.  Upon information and belief, the Commission has never denied a CPCN to a proposed \nfossil fuel-fired power plant on the basis that the proposed project was not in the “public interest” \nor on the basis that the project would have an “undue adverse impact on other environmental \nvalues” or “public health and welfare.” \n126.  Even though fossil fuel-fired power plants have a lifespan of at least thirty years, the \nCommission continues to approve them. Any fossil fuel-fired power plant approved today would \nbe expected to operate until at least 2055, well past the 2050 deadline to decarbonize Wisconsin’s \nelectricity sector.   \n127.  In 2020, the Commission issued a final decision approving a CPCN for the Nemadji Trail \nEnergy Center Project, a 550 MW gas-fired power plant. In June 2024, the Commission issued a \n  34 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 40 of 79\n \nfinal decision approving a CPCN for the Wheaton Repowering Project, a 255 MW gas-fired power \nplant. In April 2025, the Commission approved the Riverside Enhancement Project, a 17.5 MW \nexpansion to the 674.9 MW gas-fired Riverside Energy Center.  \n128.  In  May  2025,  the  Commission  approved  Wisconsin  Electric  Power  Company’s \n(“WEPCO”) application for a CPCN for Oak Creek Generation Project, a project that will convert \na fifty-year-old coal-fired power plant, at the end of its operational life, into a 1100 MW gas-fired \npower plant in Milwaukee County. The proposed project is designed for an operating life of not \nless than thirty years. The Commission also approved WEPCO’s application for a CPCN to build \nthe Paris Generation Plant in Kenosha County, a 128 MW gas-fired power plant. The air pollution \nfrom these two plants alone is projected to cause between $80 million and $127 million in health \ncosts each year from respiratory and cardiovascular disease. \n129.  The cost to build new fossil fuel-fired power plants is borne by Wisconsin residents as \nelectric providers charge ratepayers to build new power plants, which can exceed $1 billion for a \nsingle project. The Oak Creek Generation Project and Paris Generation Project will cost ratepayers \nover $1.2 billion and $270 million, respectively. \n130.  States that get a higher percentage of electricity from renewable energy sources tend to \nhave cheaper electricity prices. Wisconsin’s electricity is more expensive than electricity in thirty-\nfive other states, most of which have a higher percentage of electricity from renewable energy.16 \n131.  Wisconsin’s demand for electricity is growing and projected to increase by approximately \n15% in the next five years. \n \n16 Mark Jacobson, 60 Countries/Territories Whose Electricity Generation in 2023 was 50-100% \nWind-Water-Solar (WWS) (Including 12 With 98.4-100% WWS Generation) and 11 U.S. States \nThat Produced the Equivalent of 52.4-121.3% of the electricity They Consumed With WWS From \nQ2-2024 to Q1-2025, (May 28, 2025), https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/ \nWWSBook/Countries100Pct.pdf.  \n  35 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 41 of 79\n \n132.  Wisconsin’s electric providers plan to add approximately 2,500 MW of new gas capacity \nby 2030. The portion of Wisconsin’s electricity that comes from gas is projected to increase from \n36% in 2023 to 42% in 2030.17  \n133.  The Commission’s ongoing approval of new gas-fired power plants delays and inhibits \nWisconsin’s  transition  to  100%  renewable  energy  electricity  and  perpetuates  additional  air \npollution, rather than decreasing GHG emissions, stabilizing the climate system, and protecting \nyouth Plaintiffs. It also imposes a financial burden on Wisconsin ratepayers, including Plaintiffs’ \nfamilies, who ultimately pay for the expensive and unnecessary fossil fuel-fired power plants, \ndespite renewable energy being a cheaper and reliable alternative. There are additional financial \nburdens related to damage caused by extreme climate events, including to Plaintiffs’ homes and \nproperties; increased health care expenses; and lost opportunities for economic growth.  \n134.  Gas-fired power plants are no less harmful to youth Plaintiffs and the climate system than \ncoal-fired power plants. Gas used domestically in the U.S. to produce electricity has a GHG \nfootprint similar to, or worse than coal, when methane emissions are considered. Further, the GHG \nfootprint for the production of electricity using liquified natural gas is 33% greater than coal due \nto additional GHG emissions from the liquefaction, transport by tanker, and re-gasification of the \ngas. Therefore, the Commission’s approval of the conversion of coal-fired power plants to gas-\nfired power plants will not reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation and instead locks in \ndecades of additional climate-warming air pollution. \n135.  The challenged laws have been implemented by the Commission to authorize new fossil \nfuel-fired power plants that endanger youth Plaintiffs and delays Wisconsin’s transition to 100% \nrenewable energy. \n \n17 Public Service Commission, Strategic Energy Assessment 2024-2030, at 2. \n  36 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 42 of 79\n \nV.  The Challenged Laws Lead to Significant GHG Emissions that Cause and \nContribute to Climate Change and Harm Youth Plaintiffs. \n \n136.  As a result of the laws challenged herein, and the Commission’s ongoing approval of fossil \nfuel-fired power plants, the electricity sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in Wisconsin. \n137.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s most recent GHG data inventory, the \nelectricity sector, over which the Commission exercises regulatory control, was the largest source \nof GHG emissions in Wisconsin in 2022, producing 31.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \nequivalent (“MMTCO e”), 26.1% of the State’s overall emissions (Figure 1).18  \n2\n138.   \nFigure 1. Wisconsin GHG emissions by sector in 2022. Electricity is the largest contributor \nto GHG emissions. Data and graphic from U.S. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data \nExplorer. \n139.  Between  1993  and  2022,  the  Commission  has  authorized  the  production  of  1,245 \nMMTCO e of GHG emissions from the electric sector. That is approximately equal to the \n2\n \n18 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data Explorer, \nhttps://cfpub.epa.gov/ghgdata/inventoryexplorer/#electricpowerindustry/entiresector/allgas/categ\nory/all (last visited Aug. 15, 2025). \n  37 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 43 of 79\n \neconomy-wide GHG emissions produced by Nepal between 1993 and 2022, a country with a \npopulation of 29.6 million compared to Wisconsin’s population of 6 million. \n140.  As demonstrated in Figure 2, Wisconsin’s GHG emissions from the electric power sector \nhave barely declined in the past thirty years and remain dangerously high, thereby continuing to \nharm Plaintiffs. \n141.   \nFigure 2. Wisconsin GHG Emissions (MMTCO e) from the electric power sector from 1993 to \n2\n2022. Data and graphic from U.S. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data Explorer. \n \nVI.  The Challenged Laws Have Resulted in Levels of Air Pollution that Are Harmful \nto the Youth Plaintiffs and Are Unconstitutional. \n \n142.  There is scientific consensus that current levels of air pollution are harming youth in \nWisconsin and the natural systems on which their well-being and lives depend. Those harms are \nongoing and worsen with each increment of heating and each additional ton of GHG emissions \nthat results from the challenged laws.  \n143.  The present level of global heating is unprecedented in at least the past 100,000 years and \nis primarily the result of carbon dioxide (“CO ”) from the development and combustion of fossil \n2\nfuels, including coal, oil, and gas.  \n  38 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 44 of 79\n \n144.  The global annual average atmospheric CO2 concentration in 2024 was 422.8 parts per \nmillion (“ppm”) compared to the pre-industrial global CO2 average of 280. \n145.  The current atmospheric concentration of CO is now around levels not seen in three \n2 \nmillion years. \n146.  As air pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants, including CO , methane, and other \n2\nGHGs, continues to accumulate in the atmosphere, more heat is trapped on Earth than escapes \nback to space, causing the planet to warm.  \n147.  The excess heat retained in the Earth’s systems (i.e., oceans, ice, air, and land surface) \nbecause of increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs causes what is referred to as the Earth’s \nEnergy Imbalance (“EEI”). The EEI is a calculation of how much extra energy, or heat, is being \nretained in Earth’s systems compared to an energy balance where the amount of energy coming \ninto Earth’s atmosphere from space is equal to the amount of energy leaving Earth’s atmosphere.  \n148.  EEI is the most critical metric for determining the amount of global heating and climate \nchange we have experienced and will experience if the imbalance continues. From 1971 to 2020, \nthe Earth accumulated enough energy to bring a lake the size of 78 Lake Superiors or 193 Lake \nMichigans to boil. \n149.  Each additional ton of CO  emissions authorized by Defendants’ conduct exacerbates the \n2\nEEI and makes it more difficult and expensive to protect the Earth systems upon which Plaintiffs’ \nwell-being and lives depend.19 The more CO  added into the atmosphere by Defendants, the more \n2\n \n19 IPCC, Summary for Policymakers, in Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis 28, \nFigure SPM.10 (2021), \nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport_small.pdf; \nSee also Held v. Montana, 2023 WL 5229257, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order, \nat 24 (Mont. 1st Jud. Dist. Ct., Aug. 14, 2023) (finding of fact based on uncontroverted expert \ntestimony that “[e]very ton of fossil fuel emissions contributes to global warming and impacts to \n \n  39 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 45 of 79\n \nfrequent and harmful extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding, and drought will \nbecome in Wisconsin.  \n150.  To protect Plaintiffs from the most catastrophic and irreversible climate impacts, the EEI \nmust be restored to cool and then stabilize the climate system. \n151.  The best available science today prescribes that global atmospheric CO2 concentrations \nmust be restored to less than 350 ppm by 2100 (with further reductions thereafter) to stabilize the \nEEI and climate system on which Plaintiffs’ ability to meaningfully exercise their fundamental \nrights depend.20 The only way to do this is to reduce GHG emissions by eliminating CO  emissions \n2\nand protecting and enhancing carbon sinks to maximize the sequestration of carbon. \n152.  No one, including the International Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”), has published any \nscientific evidence to counter the finding that 350 ppm or less is the maximum safe concentration \nof CO . \n2\n153.  Achieving 100% carbon free electricity in Wisconsin no later than 2050 (and ideally \nsooner) is a necessary step towards restoring the EEI, stabilizing the climate system, protecting \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental rights, and ensuring Defendants fulfill their legal obligations.  \nVII.  The Air Pollution that Results from the Challenged Laws Is Harming Youth \nPlaintiffs and Degrading Wisconsin’s Public Trust Resources.  \n \n154.  The burning of fossil fuels for electricity in Wisconsin, authorized by the laws challenged \nherein, is causing and contributing to a range of detrimental impacts in Wisconsin, including \nwarming annual and seasonal temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, increased flooding, \n \nthe climate and thus increases the exposure of youth Plaintiffs to harms now and additional \nharms in the future.”). \n20 James Hansen et al., Assessing “Dangerous Climate Change”: Required Reductions of \nCarbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature, 8 PLOS ONE \ne81648 (2013), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0081648. \n  40 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 46 of 79\n \ndeclining winter snowpack and lake-ice coverage, alteration of lake and river ecosystems and \nresultant harm to aquatic life, changes in forest ecosystems, and increasing drought and risk of \nfires. This degradation of Wisconsin’s physical environment and public trust waters is harming \nPlaintiffs’ physical and mental health; damaging their homes, property, and farms; disrupting \ncultural practices and access to traditional food sources; causing economic losses; and impairing \nPlaintiffs’ access to and enjoyment of public trust waters. \n155.  The climate impacts in Wisconsin disproportionately affect and endanger children and \nyouth, including Plaintiffs. As children, Plaintiffs are especially susceptible to air pollution and \nclimate injuries because they experience greater proportionate exposure than adults by breathing \nmore air, drinking more water, and eating more food per unit of bodyweight than adults. Children’s \nstill-developing bodies and minds are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution, extreme heat and \nweather, and diseases. \n156.  Not only are Plaintiffs particularly vulnerable to climate change’s physical health impacts, \nthey are also more prone to suffering mental health impacts and post-traumatic stress after extreme \nweather events—often with long-lasting effects impacting their adult functioning. Climate change \nis causing children to experience a wide range of mental health impacts, including reduced capacity \nfor learning, lower emotional regulation capacity, increased restlessness and distraction, and \ndetrimental effects on childhood cognitive development.  \n157.  Climate anxiety is an emotional response to climate change that can impair functioning and \nis linked to mental health problems, including depression and generalized anxiety, and in severe \ncases, substance use and suicidal thinking. Climate anxiety and dissatisfaction with government \nresponses to climate change harms children’s daily functioning. In a survey of 15,000 youth across \nthe United States (including Wisconsin), 84.6% of Wisconsin youth respondents reported being at \n  41 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 47 of 79\n \nleast moderately worried about climate change, with 59.2% being very worried or extremely \nworried.21 Exposure to chronic stress, such as climate stress, in childhood has a long-lasting impact \nand increases the risk of developing mental health problems and physical health problems too. \nClimate-induced stress and anxiety is harming the mental and physical health of Kaarina, Tyler, \nWaazakone, Mukademigwan, Gookoonz, Madeleine, Bella, and Elia. \nA.  Rising Temperatures \n158.  Wisconsin is warming due to GHG emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.22 From 1895 \nto 2023, Wisconsin’s annual temperature has warmed at rate of 0.10°C (0.18°F) per decade and \nthe most recent decade (2014 to 2023) was 1.2°C (2.16°F) warmer than 1895 to 1904. Wisconsin’s \nannual  temperature  has  also  warmed  faster  in  more  recent  decades;  from  1950  to  2023, \nWisconsin’s annual temperature warmed at a rate of 0.23°C (0.41°F) per decade.  \n159.  While all seasons and regions of Wisconsin have warmed, winters have warmed more \nrapidly than summers. From 1950 to 2023, Wisconsin’s winter temperatures warmed at a rate of \n0.35°C (0.63°F) per decade and the most recent decade’s winter temperatures (2014 to 2023) were \n2.4°C (4.32°F) warmer than 1950 to 1959. Meanwhile, Wisconsin’s annual summer temperatures \nwarmed at a rate of 0.15°C (0.27°F) per decade since 1950 and the most recent decade’s summer \ntemperatures (2015 to 2024) were 0.7°C (1.26°F) warmer than 1950 to 1959. \n \n21 R.

Winter warming has been the most pronounced in Northwest Wisconsin (4 to 6°F warming \nsince the 1950s). Wisconsin’s warming winters are reflected in fewer days of extreme cold (below \n0°F) and with cold periods becoming less common—a pattern which is expected to continue. \n161.  Winter snowpack has declined in Wisconsin due to GHG emissions from the burning of \nfossil fuels. \n162.  This winter warming and decline in winter snowpack negatively affects the winter tourism \nindustry in Wisconsin and Wisconsinites’ enjoyment of winter activities and sports such as cross-\ncountry and downhill skiing. Snow activities combined accounted for nearly $84 million gross \ndomestic product in Wisconsin in 2022.23 As a result of reduced snowfall and fewer days cold \nenough for snowmaking, there is already a shortening of the season for winter snow sports in \nWisconsin. The shortening winter season has prevented Bella and Lucy from cross country-skiing, \nand Indy, Kaarina, Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz from downhill skiing in \nWisconsin. Lack of snow has also caused Bella’s family business to lose about $80,000 in the past \ntwo years due to cancelled winter cabin reservations and Indy’s family has seen a dramatic \ndecrease in rental income for his family’s cottage. \n163.  Wisconsin’s  winters  will  continue  to  warm  without  necessary  reductions  in  GHG \nemissions.24 Climate models project that even with moderate increases in GHG emissions, winter \ntemperatures in Wisconsin will rise an additional 3 to 8°F by 2050.  \n164.  Climate models project that Wisconsin’s average temperature will increase an additional 2 \nto 8°F above the late 20th-century average by 2050 under a mid-range GHG emissions scenario. \n \n23 Austin Holland et al., Downhill Skiing and Climate Change Adaptation in Wisconsin: \nPerspectives from Key Stakeholders, 6 Env’t Rsch.

Models project a tripling in the number of days above 90°F by 2050 (Figure \n3). Similarly, the number of hot nights where the temperature does not drop below 70°F is expected \nto quadruple by mid-century.25  \n165.   \nFigure 3. Historical and Future Projected Frequency of Extreme Heat. Average number of \ndays per year when the temperature exceeded 90°F for historical conditions (left) and projected \nnumber of days per year when the temperature will exceed 90°F by the mid-21st century (right). \nData from the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts.  \n \n166.  Cities in the northern contiguous United States, like Milwaukee, are especially vulnerable \nto heat waves because many homes and apartments lack air conditioning. By 2050, Milwaukee \nwill likely experience three times the current number of days with a heat index above 105°F, which \nis dangerous to human health. \n167.  Increased frequencies of extreme heat amplify Plaintiffs’ risk of heat-related illness and \nrespiratory  illness  in  Wisconsin.  Extreme  heat  has  well-documented,  observed  impacts  on \n \n25 Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, Wisconsin’s Changing Climate 18; \nWisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, Report to the Governor’s Task Force on \nClimate Change – Strategies to Improve Wisconsin’s Climate Resilience and Readiness 8 (July \n31, 2020), https://wicci.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/wicci-report-to-governors-task-force.pdf. \n  44 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 50 of 79\n \nchildren’s health, mortality, and morbidity. Extreme heat can cause heatstroke and exacerbate \nchronic illnesses, such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Even at current levels of \nheating, Madeleine has been unable to safely spend time outdoors in extreme heat due to her \nasthma. An increase in heat-related and respiratory illnesses will result in increased health costs \nfor Plaintiffs.  \n168.  Extreme heat causes disproportionate harm to populations vulnerable to extreme heat, \nincluding children. Children and youth working outdoors or lacking adequate air conditioning, like \nPlaintiffs Ted, Charlie, and Simon, are even more vulnerable. Children and young people are \nuniquely vulnerable to heatwaves and extreme heat because they are less able to regulate their \nbody temperature and are more prone to dehydration. Elia has been forced to limit his time \noutdoors during extreme heat due to his proclivity for migraines when he is dehydrated, which is \nmore likely to happen during exposure to extreme heat. Physical risks to children and youth from \nheatwaves  include  heatstroke,  electrolyte  imbalance,  kidney-associated  diseases,  respiratory \ndiseases such as asthma, and infectious diseases. Alex, Madeleine, Kaarina, Caroline, Lucy, Ted, \nand Indy have all experienced symptoms of heat exhaustion or been forced to stay inside rather \nthan working, playing, or training outside in extreme heat.  \n169.  Extreme heat and heatwaves also negatively impact young people’s learning, cognitive \nperformance, and mental health—with young people at greater risk of developing anxiety and \ndepression due to high heat. \nB.  Unhealthy Air Quality \n170.  Increasing air temperatures contribute to unhealthy air quality and amplify existing health \nrisks for Plaintiffs. Higher temperatures increase the formation of ground-level ozone, an air \n  45 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 51 of 79\n \npollutant that causes lung and heart problems and is especially harmful to Plaintiffs because of \ntheir age. \n171.  Extreme heat, fires, and drought caused by climate change increase ozone formation and \nparticulate pollution, which contribute to unhealthy air quality and harm children’s health. Nine of \nthe Plaintiffs—Alex, Madeleine, Elia, Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, Gookoonz, Indy, and \nCaroline—live in counties that received a failing grade for unhealthy ozone levels from the \nAmerican Lung Association in the State of the Air Report 2025, including Dane, Milwaukee, and \nRock counties. Three of the Plaintiffs—Kaarina, Ted, and Lucy—live in a county that earned a D \ngrade for unhealthy ozone levels, including La Crosse and Marathon counties. \n172.  Eight  of  the  Plaintiffs—Alex,  Madeleine,  Elia,  Tyler,  Waazakone,  Mukademigwan, \nGookoonz, and Indy—live in a county that received a failing grade for high incidence of days with \nunhealthy particle pollution, including Dane and Milwaukee counties.  \n173.  Longer growing seasons due to warming air temperatures have led to an increase in the \nduration and severity of pollen season, which causes health problems for people with pollen \nallergies. The combination of pollen and air pollution from burning fossil fuels can exacerbate \nasthma attacks and allergic reactions for children and youth. Madeleine suffers from asthma and \nintense pollen allergies that have worsened making it difficult for her to focus while in school.  \n174.  With climate change contributing to longer growing seasons, reduced snowpack, and \nwarmer air temperatures, the occurrence of fires in Wisconsin is projected to increase. In the Upper \nGreat Lakes region (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota), fire probability has historically been \nlow but is projected to increase by 50 to75% by 2100. \n175.  Based upon the Fifth National Climate Assessment’s projections, many Midwest counties \nwill experience greater smoke exposure in the coming years. Wildfire smoke presents a significant \n  46 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 52 of 79\n \nand growing source of injury for Plaintiffs. Elia, Indy, Madeleine, Lucy, Simon, and Caroline have \nhad activities cancelled or moved inside, and limited their time outside, due to wildfire smoke. \n176.  Coal and gas-fired power plants emit a mixture of air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide \n(“NO ”), fine particulate matter (“PM ”), black carbon, and ozone precursors, that are harmful to \n2 2.5\nPlaintiffs. Living in communities with fossil fuel-fired power plants is strongly associated with \nhigher exposure to harmful air pollutants, including NO  and PM , which are known to impair \n2 2.5\nchildren’s  lung  development  during  critical  periods  of  growth.  Plaintiffs  Lucy,  Caroline, \nMadeleine, Indy, Alex, Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz live in communities \nwith fossil fuel-fired power plants and are forced to breathe air polluted by the burning of coal and \ngas.  \nC.  Changing Precipitation Patterns \n177.  Precipitation is increasing in Wisconsin due to anthropogenic climate change, especially \nin the southern two-thirds of the State. In the past decade, nearly every region of Wisconsin has \nexperienced extreme rainfall events, with devastating effects, such as the flooding of roads, homes, \nbusinesses, and farm fields. Extreme precipitation events and associated flooding are predicted to \ncontinue throughout the State, with wide ranging consequences to Wisconsin’s natural and built \nenvironments,  including  washing  away  topsoil,  disrupting  farm  operations,  and  damaging \ninfrastructure. Extreme precipitation events have disrupted farm operations on both Charlie’s and \nTed’s family farms, forcing them to buy feed for cows that they used to grow, build expensive \nshelters, suffer crop loses, and incur other expenses. Extreme precipitation events and ensuing \nerosion  and  landslides  caused  damage  to  Kaarina’s  property,  causing  her  economic  injury, \nemotional distress, and forcing her to move out of her childhood home and change schools.  \n  47 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 53 of 79\n \n178.  Winter precipitation in Wisconsin has increased by at least 20% since 1950 in much of the \nState (Figure 4). Due to warming winter temperatures, this precipitation is increasingly falling as \nrain rather than snow. Rain is more likely to run off frozen ground into the State’s waterways and \nnegatively impact water quality, rather than soak into the soil. Charlie’s family dairy farm had to \nbuild an additional barn to house their cows in the winter because the winter rain has made the \nground muddy and unsuitable for the cows to lay on. \n179.   \nFigure 4. Historical Change in Average Annual and Winter Precipitation. Historical \nchange in annual precipitation from 1950 to 2023 (left), historical change in winter \n(December, January, February) precipitation from 1950 to 2023. Graphic from Wisconsin \nInitiative on Climate Change Impacts. \n  \n180.  Wisconsin’s average annual precipitation is projected to increase 8 to 20% by 2050 relative \nto the past five decades. The greatest increase in precipitation is projected to occur in the winter \nand spring, with precipitation becoming more variable in summer and fall (Figure 5).26  \n \n26 Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, Wisconsin’s Changing Climate, 19; Aaron \nB. Wilson et. al., Fifth National Climate Assessment, Ch. 24.

Maps adapted from Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change. \n \n182.  Extreme precipitation events, such as two-inch rainfall events (Figure 6), are projected to \ncontinue to increase in both frequency and magnitude.27 Extreme precipitation events and related \nflooding have adverse impacts on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, human health, critical \ninfrastructure, and cause billions of dollars in damage to local and regional economies, including \nto the Plaintiffs’ and their families. \n183.   \nFigure 6. Historical and Future Projected Frequency of Extreme Rainfall. Average days per \ndecade with two or more inches of precipitation in twenty-four hours for historical conditions \n(left) and by mid-21st century (right), showing increases in extreme precipitation.

While  precipitation  is  increasing  in  Wisconsin  overall,  projected  increases  in \nevapotranspiration and longer periods between rainfall events are projected to cause drought \nconditions in some regions of the State. The combination of warming temperatures and variable \nsummer precipitation creates an increased risk of drought in the summer. Failure of private wells \nis projected to increase during drought as the water table drops due to increased water usage and \nirrigation. Ted’s family had to install an additional well to meet increasing irrigation demands on \nhis family’s vegetable farm. \n185.  The flooding of houses increases respiratory health risks such as irritation of asthma by \nmold growth. Flooding in Madeleine’s basement has increased in frequency and severity, causing \nher economic injury and increasing her risk of asthma irritation. Elia’s family made significant \ninvestment in installing a double sump pump and building their house higher above ground to \nreduce the risk of flooding in their basement. \nD.  Harms to Wisconsin’s Agriculture Sector \n186.  The changing climatic conditions are harming Wisconsin’s agricultural sector, an integral \npart of Wisconsin’s economy, history, and culture. The agriculture sector provides 435,700 jobs \n(11.8% of the State’s employment) and contributes $104.8 billion to the State’s economy.28 Ted \nand Charlie’s farms are being directly harmed by the changing climatic conditions.  \n187.  Increased precipitation variability and more frequent wet-dry transitions increases the risk \nof transient drought in crops, threatening crop viability. Crops on Ted’s farm have died because of \ntransient drought.  \n \n28 Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, Wisconsin \nAgricultural Statistics (updated June 26, 2025), \nhttps://datcp.wi.gov/Pages/Publications/WIAgStatistics.aspx. \n  50 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 56 of 79\n \n188.  Increased precipitation is causing waterlogged soils, which delays planting and shortens \nplanting windows in the spring and harvesting in the fall. Planting crops in the spring has been \nmuch  more  difficult  on  Ted’s  family  farm  due  to  shortened  planting  windows.  Excessive \nprecipitation is causing increased crop loss especially during seed germination periods. Charlie’s \nfarm was unable to grow sufficient feed for their cows in 2024 due to waterlogged soils and, as a \nresult, had to purchase additional feed from external sources. \n189.  Increasingly hot summers are also projected to reduce crop yields. As temperatures warm, \nvapor pressure deficit increases, and crops lose more water. Without an expansion of irrigation, \nincreases in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit will limit crop yields. Hotter summers increase the \nneed for irrigation, depleting Wisconsin’s water resources. Ted’s family farm has experienced \nreduced crop yields due to hot summers and installed a new well to meet increasing irrigation \nneeds on the farm.  \n190.  Extreme heat and cold fluctuations are harming Wisconsin’s agriculture. Rapid temperature \nfluctuations above and below freezing in the spring have damaged fruit crops and degraded soil \nhealth. Extreme heat in the summer has caused stress to dairy cows, which has decreased milk \nproduction and increased water usage.  \nE.  Loss of Wild Rice \n191.  Climate change threatens wild rice (“manoomin” in Ojibwe), a crop sacred to the Ojibwe, \nMenominee, and other indigenous people, and to Plaintiffs Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, \nand Gookoonz. Wild rice is central to the creation story of the Anishinaabe, a vast cultural and \nlinguistic collective that includes the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi. Wild rice grows in shallow \nwaters in Northern Wisconsin and is especially vulnerable to climate change due to warming \nwaters and altered hydrology. Climate change threatens to move wild rice’s habitat farther north \n  51 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 57 of 79\n \nand out of the reach of the Ojibwe Tribal Nations. The decreased harvest rates and projected loss \nof access to wild rice are leading to a distressing loss of cultural identity for the Anishinaabe \npeople, including Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz, whose ability to harvest \nwild rice as one of their main food sources has already been diminished. \nF.  Harm to Forests and Wildlife Diversity \n192.  Warmer winters reduce snowpack, which insulates trees in Wisconsin forests, and create \nmore favorable conditions for pests and diseases. These climatic shifts are allowing southern \nspecies to start to outcompete native boreal tree species.  \n193.  Wisconsin is the fourth largest producer of maple syrup in the country, but climate change \nis undermining Wisconsin’s maple syrup production. Maple sap (“ziinzibaakwadwaaboo” in \nOjibwe) runs in the early spring and is dependent on consistent nightly freezes and daily thaws. \nWarming temperatures are shifting the sap-collecting season earlier in the year, and increasing \nweather variability is making annual production of syrup more variable. The warming climate \nresults in a decrease in sugar content in the maple sap (requiring more effort to convert it to maple \nsyrup).  Tyler,  Waazakone,  Mukademigwan,  and  Gookoonz’s  maple  sugaring  tradition  is \nthreatened by climate change. \n194.  The paper birch, a species culturally significant to tribes in Wisconsin, is declining in \nnorthern  forests.  The  Great  Lakes  Indian  Fish  and  Wildlife  Commission’s  climate  change \nvulnerability assessment listed paper birch as highly vulnerable to climate change. Anishnaabe \npeople, including Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz, traditionally use paper birch \nbark for canoes, dwellings (“wiigiwaams” in Ojibwe), baskets, and scrolls in their ceremonies. \nHowever, paper birch populations, which thrive in cool climates, have been harmed by warming \ntemperatures, and populations are expected to continue to decline in Wisconsin. \n  52 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 58 of 79\n \n195.  Paper  birch’s  decline  has  led  to  harvest  restrictions  and  negatively  impacted  tribal \nmembers’ ability to use paper birch in traditional ceremonies, for canoe building, and for medicine. \n196.  Wisconsin is renowned for its wildlife diversity. Tribal Nations within Wisconsin’s state \nboundaries, and Plaintiffs Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz rely on wildlife \ndiversity for subsistence hunting and gathering for their spiritual, cultural, and physical well-being. \nThe negative impacts of climate change on wildlife in Wisconsin are harming Wisconsin’s outdoor \ntourism economy and tribal members’ subsistence hunting. More intense summer droughts and \nincreased flooding from climate change are reducing critical habitat and food sources for wildlife, \nespecially waterfowl which depend on wetlands. Warmer winters with reduced snow cover, more \npests, and changing water levels also stress wildlife species.  \nG. Increasing Vector Borne Illnesses \n197.  Disease-carrying  insects,  including  ticks,  are  becoming  more  widely  distributed  in \nWisconsin due to anthropogenic climate change. Rising temperatures, especially in the winter, \nhave contributed to the expanded range of ticks, the vector of Lyme disease, because ticks are more \nactive above 45°F. Wisconsin has one of the highest rates of Lyme disease in the country. Lyme \ndisease causes joint pain, fever, fatigue, and headaches. Weeks to months after acquiring the \ndisease, people can experience severe headaches, arthritis with severe muscle and joint pain, \ninflammation of the brain, and heart palpitations. \n198.  Tick bites, especially from the lone star tick, can also cause alpha-gal syndrome, an \nacquired red meat allergy that can manifest in hives, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, and anaphylaxis. \nBella had Lyme disease, which caused her nausea, and she developed alpha-gal syndrome. \nWaazakone has also had Lyme disease, which caused her joint pain that made it difficult to walk. \nOther Plaintiffs are increasingly at risk of getting Lyme disease.  \n  53 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 59 of 79\n \n199.  The increased incidence of various vector-borne diseases is likely to have negative impacts \non Plaintiffs’ health, as children tend to spend more time outdoors, where they can be exposed to \nhigh temperatures and where disease vectors like ticks are found. Children are more prone to \ninfection with vector-borne diseases due to their smaller body size and developing immune system. \nChildren are also more likely to experience more severe disease, more complications, and are less \nlikely to have a complete recovery than adults, for Lyme disease. \n200.  On average, about 4,000 cases of Lyme disease were reported each year from 2018 to 2022 \nand the average number of reported cases in Wisconsin has tripled over the past fifteen years \n(Figure 7).29  \n201.   \nFigure 7. Annual reported cases of Lyme disease in Wisconsin from 1990.

Degradation of Wisconsin’s Public Trust Waters \nWarming Lakes Harm Fisheries and Fish Habitat \n202.  Inland lake water temperatures are warming in Wisconsin. Summer has become longer and \nwarmer due to climate change which is resulting in a longer period of thermal stratification in \ninland lakes, causing low oxygen conditions that are harmful to fish. \n203.  As summers grow longer and warmer, the probability of fish kills increases due to oxygen \ndepletion of the lake waters. When oxygen is depleted in deeper colder layers of the lake, cold-\nwater fish are forced to move up to shallower layers with more oxygen. However, the warmer \ntemperatures  of  these  shallower  layers  can  be  lethal  for  the  cold-water  fish.  Fish  kills  in \nWisconsin’s inland lakes are projected to double by 2050 and quadruple by 2100.30  \n204.  Warming water temperatures and declining and increasingly variable ice cover are shifting \naquatic ecosystem compositions and changing the species of fish that can survive in Wisconsin’s \nlakes and streams. Such climate-induced changes are diminishing fishing opportunities for Ted, \nKaarina, Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz. Current models show 21,300 miles \nof streams are suitable for brook trout and 12,400 miles of streams are suitable for brown trout in \nWisconsin.31 However, climate models (under a moderate to high emissions scenario) project that \ndue to climate change stream habitat for brook trout and brown trout will decline by 68% and 32% \nby 2050, respectively. Climate change has reduced the number of trout that Ted can catch on \nBaldwin Creek and the Rib River.   \n205.  Cisco (lake herring) have already disappeared from 29% of Wisconsin’s inland lakes with \ncold-water fisheries, and lake whitefish have disappeared from 33% of these inland lakes due to \n \n30 Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, Wisconsin’s Changing Climate 51. \n31 Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, Wisconsin’s Changing Climate 49; Aaron B. \nWilson et. al., Fifth National Climate Assessment, Ch. 24. Midwest 24-12, 24-14. \n  55 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 61 of 79\n \nwarming waters.32 Wisconsin is expected to lose 160 lakes currently classified as cool by 2049 and \nall but four of the State’s cool lakes will be warm by 2089. As these inland lakes warm, they will \nbecome  unsuitable  habitats  for  cool-water  game  fish  like  walleye,  perch,  sturgeon,  and \nmuskellunge.  Tyler,  Waazakone,  Mukademigwan,  and  Gookoonz’s  ability  to  fish  for  their \ntraditional foods has been greatly reduced by declining fish populations due to climate change. \nWisconsin’s Lakes Are Warming and Winter Ice Is Declining \n206.  Changing climatic conditions are causing warmer water temperatures, changes in lake \nmixing, and reduced ice cover on Wisconsin’s lakes, including Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. \nLake Superior is one of the fastest warming lakes in the world. \n207.  The extent and duration of winter ice cover on the Great Lakes has declined in the past four \ndecades. Nine of the top ten lowest ice cover years have occurred since 2002. Winter ice coverage \non all the Great Lakes declined by 71% from 1973 to 2010. Both ice cover duration and thickness \nare projected to continue to decline. Thinner ice on lakes increases the risk of drowning and \ndecreases the opportunity for recreational activities on frozen lakes, such as ice skating or ice \nfishing. This loss of opportunity to engage in winter recreation negatively impacts Wisconsin’s \nwinter cultural traditions and tourism economy (Figure 8). The loss of lake ice has reduced Elia \nand  Madeleine’s  opportunities  to  ice  skate  and  Tyler,  Waazakone,  Mukademigwan,  and \nGookoonz’s ability to ice fish in the winter.  \n \n32 Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, Wisconsin’s Changing Climate 50. \n  56 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 62 of 79\n \n208.   \nFigure 8. Ice-covered inland waters provide humans with important ecosystems services \n(light blue ring), benefits (dark blue ring), and activities (yellow ring) that are central to \npeople’s well-being, culture, and identity in Wisconsin. Adapted from the IPCC Fifth National \nClimate Assessment at 24-15. \n209.  The duration of ice coverage on Lake Mendota, where Alex and Elia recreate, has been \ndeclining steadily in recent decades. Historically, Lake Mendota froze in early December and \nthawed in mid-April; today, Lake Mendota freezes in early January and thaws in late March. \nClimate change has shaved off more than a month of the season for ice fishing and ice skating.  \nIncreasing Harmful Algal Blooms \n210.  Higher frequency and magnitude of extreme rain events results in increased runoff carrying \nnutrients and contaminants into Wisconsin’s rivers, streams, and lakes and deteriorating their water \nquality. These changes are causing degraded water quality and are increasing the occurrence of \nharmful  algal  blooms  (“HAB”),  including  cyanobacteria  or  blue-green  algae  blooms,  in \nWisconsin’s lakes. HABs negatively affect water quality, make swimming unsafe, and detract from \n  57 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 63 of 79\n \nscenic  beauty  and  enjoyment  of  lakes.  HABs  can  also  cause  fish  kills,  thereby  reducing \nopportunities for fishing. \n211.  The increased occurrence of HABs presents a danger to Plaintiffs’ health. HABs are caused \nby  a  variety  of  algal  groups  with  different  toxins  harmful  to  human  health.  Swallowing \ncontaminated water can cause vomiting, diarrhea, muscle twitching, and respiratory failure. \nCaroline, Lucy, Charlie, Madeleine, Alex, Elia, Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz \nhave all been prevented from recreating on or enjoying the beauty of Wisconsin’s lakes because of \nalgal blooms. \nDegradation of Wisconsin’s Lakes and Rivers  \n212.  Increasing precipitation and storms delivering large amounts of water results in flooding \nof Wisconsin’s rivers and lakes. At the same time, longer periods between rainfall events and \nincreases in evapotranspiration causes drought, resulting in rapid declines in water levels and \nstream flows. \n213.  In August 2025, the rivers in Milwaukee flooded from extreme rainfall, including the \nMilwaukee River that rose thirteen feet over a two-day period.33 In times of drought, the water \nlevel of the Milwaukee River has been so low that Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and \nGookoonz could not go canoeing or kayaking. Such extreme fluctuations are increasingly common \nas a result of climate change. \n \n33 Madeleine Heim, See how Dramatically Milwaukee Rivers Rose During 1,000-Year Flood, \nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Aug. 12, 2025, https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/ \n2025/08/12/see-how-milwaukee-rivers-rose-in-wauwatosa-waukesha-cedarburg/85625278007/; \nScott Bauer, ‘What is Happening?’ Milwaukee Area Recovers from Record Rain and Flooding, \nPBS News, Aug. 11, 2025, https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-is-happening-milwaukee-\narea-recovers-from-record-rain-and-flooding. \n  58 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 64 of 79\n \n214.  The area along the Great Lakes is warming faster than the general pattern of warming \nacross Wisconsin, leading to physical changes in the lakes such as water fluctuations, changes to \nwater temperature and lake mixing, and ice cover changes impacting coastal land, habitats, water \nquality, and impacts to native species like walleye and wild rice.34 The Great Lakes are central to \nthe Anishinaabeg migration story and the changes to the lakes that prevent harvest of culturally \nimportant foods harm Tyler, Waazakone, Mukademigwan, and Gookoonz’s ability to eat their \ntraditional Anishinaabe diet.  \n215.  Changes  in  precipitation,  snow  melt,  evapotranspiration,  and  storm  intensity  have \nincreased river flow variability in the upper Mississippi River in Wisconsin. As a result, the \nMississippi River is more susceptible to flooding and drought. Extended high water river flows \nand fall flooding have occurred in seven of the past ten years. Cumulative runoff has increased in \nrecent decades and is projected to continue to increase leading to increased flooding of the \nMississippi. Flooding and extended high water high levels have prevented Kaarina from swimming \nand accessing her dock on the Mississippi River at her family’s cabin.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Inherent Right to Liberty Under Wisconsin Constitution Article I § 1 \n(Against the Commission and Commissioners \nSummer Strand, Kristy Nieto, and Marcus Hawkins) \n216.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations set forth \nabove.   \n217.  The  Declaration  of  Rights  in  the  Wisconsin  Constitution  establishes  limitations  or \nrestrictions on state action. These restrictions were motivated by “[t]he historical intention of state \n \n34 Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts, Water, https://wicci.wisc.edu/2021-\nassessment-report/water/ (last visited Aug. 15, 2025). \n  59 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 65 of 79\n \nconstitutions, including Wisconsin’s . . . to recognize rights of the people and protect them from \ngovernmental interference.”35  \n218.

Article I § 1 is a limitation on the Legislature’s plenary powers to make laws \nthat infringe on Wisconsinites’ inherent rights. \n219.  The plain language directives of Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4. unconstitutionally \nprohibit the Commission from denying a CPCN to fossil fuel-fired power plants. In complying \nwith Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4., the Commission is perpetuating an electricity sector \ndominated by fossil fuels through its historic and ongoing permitting of fossil fuel-fired power \nplants. \n220.  The  plain  language  directives  of  Wis.  Stat.  §  196.025(1)(c)1.  and  Wis.

Stat. §§ \n196.491(3)(d)3. and 4, 196.025(1)(c)1., and 196.378(4m)(a) violate Plaintiffs’ inherent right to a \nstable climate system. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of Inherent Right to Access, Enjoy, and Use Navigable Waters and their Beds \nUnder Wisconsin Constitution Article I § 1 \n(Against the Commission and Commissioners  \nSummer Strand, Kristy Nieto, and Marcus Hawkins) \n251.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations set forth \nabove.   \n252.  Article I § 1 explicitly protects “inherent rights,” which are “broad enough to cover every \nprinciple of natural right, of abstract justice.”37 These inherent rights include rights that are not \nenumerated in Article I § 1, and the constitutionally protected inherent rights should not be \ninterpreted in an unduly limited manner. \n253.  Navigable waters and the lands under them have long been recognized as protected for the \ninhabitants of the place now known as Wisconsin. The right of Wisconsinites to access, enjoy, and \nuse the navigable waters of the state pre-dates Wisconsin’s statehood. The Northwest Ordinance, \nfor example, recognized that navigable waters “shall be common highways and forever free” for \npeople of the territory. The United States Supreme Court has held that states hold navigable waters \n \n37 Black v. State, 113 Wis. 205, 226 (1902) (Marshall, J., concurring). \n  66 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 72 of 79\n \nand their beds “in trust for the people of the state, that they may enjoy the navigation of the waters, \ncarry on commerce over them, and have liberty of fishing therein . . . .”38 \n254.  The longstanding right of Wisconsinites to access, enjoy, and use navigable waters and \ntheir beds is inextricably connected with the preservation of other constitutional rights, including \nthe right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Without access and use of navigable waters, \nPlaintiffs cannot engage in activities such as navigation and fishing, or access culturally important \nfood sources. \n255.  The Wisconsin Constitution prohibits the Commission from taking action that destroys or \nsubstantially impairs navigable waters and the lands under them, or Wisconsinites’ right to access, \nenjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds.  \n256.  Wis. Stat. §§ 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4., 196.025(1)(c)1., and 196.378(4m)(a) have caused, \nand continue to cause, air pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants that is substantially \nimpairing Wisconsin’s waters, and infringing on Plaintiffs’ right to access, enjoy, and use such \nresources free from impairment or destruction. As such, Wis. Stat. §§ 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4., \n196.025(1)(c)1., and 196.378(4m)(a) deprive Plaintiffs of their right under Wisconsin Constitution \nArticle I § 1 to access, enjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds. \n257.  Technologically and economically feasible means of providing adequate, reliable, secure, \nand affordable energy are available which do not further impair Wisconsin’s navigable waters and \ntheir beds, or Plaintiffs’ access, enjoyment, and use of such waters and beds. \n258.  An actual and justiciable controversy exists between the parties as to the violation of \nPlaintiffs’ right to access, enjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds under Wisconsin \nConstitution Article I § 1. Plaintiffs suffer, and will continue to suffer, injuries due to the \n \n38 Illinois Cent. R. Co. v. State of Illinois, 146 U.S. 387, 452 (1892).  \n  67 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 73 of 79\n \nCommission’s  implementation  and  enforcement  of  Wis.  Stat.  §§  196.491(3)(d)3.  and  4., \n196.025(1)(c)1., and 196.378(4m)(a) until the Commission is restrained from doing so. \n259.  A declaration that Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4. are infringing on Plaintiffs’ right to \naccess, enjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds, and are unconstitutional as applied to the \nCommission’s determination of whether to approve or deny CPCNs for fossil fuel-fired power \nplants, would remove a barrier to the Commission’s ability to deny CPCNs for such facilities. \n260.  A declaration that Wis. Stat. §§ 196.025(1)(c)1 and 196.378(4m)(a) are infringing on \nPlaintiffs’ right to access, enjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds, and are facially \nunconstitutional, would remove a barrier to the Commission’s ability to require electric providers \nto build or purchase more electricity from renewable sources.  \n261.  A declaratory judgment would effect a change with concrete ramifications in legal status \nand relations between Plaintiffs and the Commission and would provide Plaintiffs meaningful \nredress. A declaratory judgment will prevent further infringement of Plaintiffs’ inherent right to \naccess, enjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds and reduce the extent of their ongoing and \nfuture injuries.  \n262.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief from this Court pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 806.04(1) \nand, if necessary and proper, injunctive relief pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 806.04(8) that Wis. Stat. §§ \n196.491(3)(d)3. and 4, 196.025(1)(c)1., and 196.378(4m)(a) violate Plaintiffs’ right to access, \nenjoy, and use navigable waters and their beds. \nCOUNT V \nViolation of Wisconsin’s Public Trust Doctrine Under Wisconsin Article IX § 1 \n(Against All Defendants) \n263.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations set forth \nabove.  \n  68 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 74 of 79\n \n264.  The public trust doctrine requires sovereign governments, including Defendants, to protect, \npreserve, and prevent substantial impairment to, and waste of, public trust resources for the benefit \nof present and future generations of Wisconsinites, including youth Plaintiffs.  \n265.  The public trust doctrine predates Wisconsin’s statehood and has its roots in Roman law. \nThe public trust doctrine can be traced through the Magna Carta to the United States and is deeply \nrooted in Wisconsin history and jurisprudence.  \n266.  Certain public trust rights have been codified in the Wisconsin Constitution. They were not \ncreated by the Constitution. The constitutional codification of certain public trust rights and \nobligations does not extinguish other common law public trust rights.  \n267.  Wisconsin’s Constitution, Article IX § 1, provides that: \n[T]he river Mississippi and the navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and \nSt.  Lawrence,  and  the  carrying  places  between  the  same,  shall  be  common \nhighways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the state as to the citizens \nof the United States, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor.   \n \n268.  Wisconsin’s constitutionally enshrined public trust doctrine provides that waters and river \nand lake beds are held in trust by the State of Wisconsin for the benefit of the public. The public \ntrust protects not only the Great Lakes and their beds but also lesser inland waters, including areas \ncovered with aquatic vegetation within a particular high-water mark. \n269.  The Wisconsin Legislature is the trustee of navigable waters for the benefit of Wisconsin’s \ncitizens who are the trust’s beneficiaries. The Wisconsin Legislature and the Commission each \nhave an affirmative fiduciary duty to protect navigable waters for the benefit of Wisconsin citizens. \n270.  The rights and uses of public trust resources have evolved over time and been interpreted \nexpansively to protect and preserve a wide range of commercial and recreational uses of waters, \nincluding the right of present and future generations to access, enjoy, and use public trust resources \n  69 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 75 of 79\n \nfor navigation, fishing, hunting, commerce, boating, bathing, skating, scenic beauty, and other \npublic purposes.  \n271.  Government conduct violates the public trust doctrine when there is sufficiently concrete, \nspecific evidence of harm or potential harm to public trust resources resulting from the government \nconduct or ensuing pollution. \n272.  Wis. Stat. §§ 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4., 196.025(1)(c)1., and 196.378(4m)(a) have caused, \nand continue to cause, air pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants which is substantially \nimpairing and endangering Wisconsin’s public trust resources. Consequently, Plaintiffs’ ability to \naccess, enjoy, and use public trust waters for navigation, fishing, hunting, boating, bathing, skating, \nscenic beauty, and other public purposes has been infringed. The air pollution that Defendants \nhave authorized to be emitted into the atmosphere has a scientifically demonstrable effect on \nPlaintiffs’ ability to access, enjoy, and use Wisconsin’s public trust resources. \n273.  As such, Wis. Stat. § 196.491(3)(d)3. and 4., as applied to fossil fuel-fired power plants, \nand  Wis.  Stat.  §§  196.025(1)(c)1.  and  196.378(4m)(a)  on  their  face,  substantially  impair \nWisconsin’s public trust resources and Plaintiffs’ right to access, enjoy, and use Wisconsin’s public \ntrust resources. \n274.  An actual and justiciable controversy exists between the parties as to whether Wisconsin’s \npublic trust resources are substantially impaired. Plaintiffs suffer and will continue to suffer \ninjuries due to Defendants’ implementation and enforcement of Wis. Stat. §§ 196.491(3)(d)3. and \n4., 196.025(1)(c)1., and 196.378(4m)(a) until Defendants are restrained from doing so. \n275.  A  declaration  that  Wis.  Stat.  §  196.491(3)(d)3.  and  4.  are  substantially  impairing \nWisconsin’s public trust resources, and are unconstitutional as applied to the Commission’s \n  70 \n\nCase 2025CV002797 Document 6 Filed 08-22-2025 Page 76 of 79\n \ndetermination of whether to approve or deny CPCNs for fossil fuel-fired power plants would \nremove a barrier to the Commission’s ability to deny CPCNs for such facilities.  \n276.  A declaration that Wis. Stat. §§ 196.025(1)(c)1 and 196.378(4m)(a) are substantially \nimpairing Wisconsin’s public trust resources, and are facially unconstitutional, would remove a \nbarrier to the Commission’s ability to require electric providers to build or purchase more \nelectricity from renewable sources.  \n277.  A declaratory judgment would effect a change with concrete ramifications in legal status \nand relations between Plaintiffs and Defendants and would provide Plaintiffs meaningful redress. \nA declaratory judgment will prevent further infringement of Plaintiffs’ public trust rights and \nreduce the extent of their ongoing and future injuries.  \n278.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief from this Court pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 806.04(1) \nand, if necessary and proper, injunctive relief pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 806.04(8) that Wis. Stat. §§ \n196.491(3)(d)3. and 4., 196.025(1)(c)1., and 196.378(4m)(a) violate Plaintiffs’ public trust rights. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nYouth Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.
