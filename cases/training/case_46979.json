In a triumph of the Civil Rights Movement, Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act \n(FHA) in 1968 to outlaw discrimination in housing and help move our country towards a more \nequal society.  As part of that law, Congress adopted a broad anti-interference provision to protect \npeople who exercise their fair housing rights or help others do so. \n2.  Congress provided for robust judicial and administrative enforcement of the Fair \nHousing Act.  By statute, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is \nvested with both the authority and responsibility to administer the FHA.  HUD is obligated by \nstatute and regulation to process and investigate complaints of housing discrimination submitted \nby the public, charge cases where reasonable cause exists to believe discrimination has or will \noccur, conciliate cases in an attempt to reach agreement between the parties, and prosecute cases \nwhere they cannot be voluntarily resolved.  HUD’s enforcement processes are thus a critical—and \nmandatory—component of the administrative scheme through which complainants vindicate their \nrights under the Fair Housing Act.   \n3.  Within HUD, the Office of Fair Housing (OFH) in the Office of General Counsel \nis the legal office responsible for enforcing fair housing and civil rights laws, including the Fair \nHousing Act.  Plaintiffs are attorneys who work (or used to work) in OFH on FHA matters.  \nPlaintiffs’ work advising investigators, issuing investigatory subpoenas, drafting and issuing \ncharges of discrimination, prosecuting charges before administrative law judges, and ensuring \nFHA  compliance  agency-wide  was  critical  to  HUD’s  enforcement  efforts  and  advancing \neveryone’s right to be free from housing discrimination.  \n4.  It is because of that work that Plaintiffs have been unlawfully targeted by HUD \nleadership and forced to leave OFH against their will.  Earlier this year, following the change in \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 3 of 37\npresidential administration, agency leaders set out to eliminate the Office of Fair Housing out of \nopen  hostility  towards  civil  rights  enforcement  generally  and  fair  housing  law  specifically.  \nLeadership initially sought to get rid of the entire office in one fell swoop through a Reduction in \nForce.  When that was headed off by obvious legal concerns, HUD officials settled on a different \nstrategy  to  cripple  the  office:  targeting  individual  attorneys  within  OFH  by  involuntarily \nreassigning them to different divisions where they could no longer work to enforce the Fair \nHousing Act.     \n5.  But the Fair Housing Act does not allow Plaintiffs to be targeted for adverse action \nbecause of their work enforcing the FHA.  Under the FHA’s interference provision, “[i]t shall be \nunlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person . . . on account of his having \naided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of” their fair housing rights.  42 \nU.S.C. § 3617.   \n6.  That is exactly what agency officials have done here.  Because Plaintiffs assisted \ncomplainants and others in asserting and vindicating their rights under the FHA, HUD leadership \ninvoluntarily reassigned them from the jobs they were hired to do.  Agency officials said more \nthan once that “fair housing is not a priority” of the Administration, and that there was an “optics \nproblem” with the size of OFH.  But OFH’s workload is statutorily obligated and driven by \ncomplaints filed by members of the public alleging claims of housing discrimination.  While \nagency  officials  claim  that  the  reassignments  were  necessary  to  address  staffing  shortages \nelsewhere in the agency, that justification was cover for the real motivation behind the adverse \naction: unlawful animus towards Fair Housing Act enforcement and the people who carry out that \nwork.  The agency’s inconsistent explanations and shifting stories show that the proffered reasons \nwere pretextual.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 4 of 37\n7.  Plaintiffs now find themselves in an unfamiliar position.  As attorneys at OFH, \nPlaintiffs helped other people vindicate their rights under the Fair Housing Act.  Today, though, \nPlaintiffs are the ones seeking to vindicate their own rights under that law.  Plaintiffs ask this Court \nto declare that their reassignments are unlawful and enter an injunction ordering HUD to cancel \nthe reassignments and reinstate Plaintiffs to their positions in the Office of Fair Housing, so they \ncan get back to work delivering on the promise of fair housing for all. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff Palmer Heenan is an individual who resides in Arlington, VA.  He is \nemployed by HUD in the Office of General Counsel. \n9.  Plaintiff Paul Osadebe is an individual who resides in Washington, DC.  He is \nemployed by HUD in the Office of General Counsel. \n10.  Plaintiff Julia Dykstra is an individual who resides in Washington, DC.  She is \nemployed by HUD in the Office of General Counsel. \n11.  Plaintiff Ashley Vazquez is an individual who resides in Washington, DC.  She is \nemployed by HUD in the Office of General Counsel. \n12.  Plaintiff Hannah Gordon is an individual who resides in Washington, DC.  She is \nemployed by HUD in the Office of General Counsel. \n13.  Defendant U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is an \nexecutive department of the United States government.  See 42 U.S.C. § 3532. \n14.  Defendant Scott Turner is the Secretary of HUD, the highest-level official in the \nDepartment.  He is sued in his official capacity.   \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 5 of 37\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.  Jurisdiction in this Court is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4), because this \nlawsuit is a “civil action authorized by law” to “secure equitable or other relief under any Act of \nCongress providing for the protection of civil rights,” namely, the Fair Housing Act. \n16.  This Court also has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because \nthis action arises under the laws of the United States, specifically the Fair Housing Act. \n17.  Venue is proper in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(A) because the Defendants include an agency of the United States that \nresides in this District; and under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) because four of the Plaintiffs reside \nin this District (Mr. Osadebe, Ms. Dykstra, Ms. Vazquez, and Ms. Gordon), and no real property \nis involved in the action.   \n18.  Sovereign immunity is waived by 5 U.S.C. § 702. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Fair Housing Act and HUD’s Office of Fair Housing \n19.  Although de jure racial segregation was declared unconstitutional more than a \ncentury ago, “its vestiges remain today, intertwined with the country’s economic and social life.”  \nTexas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affs. v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519, 528 \n(2015).    In  1968,  President  Johnson’s  Kerner  Commission  determined,  after  “extensive \nfactfinding,”  that  “residential  segregation  and  unequal  housing  and  economic  conditions” \ncontinued to afflict families across American cities, so much so that the Commission feared our \nsociety was “moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.”  Id. at \n529 (citation omitted).  To address “this deepening racial division,” the Commission recommended \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 6 of 37\n“a comprehensive and enforceable open-occupancy law” to prohibit discrimination “in the sale or \nrental of any housing.”  Id. at 529–530 (citation and alteration omitted).   \n20.  In the days following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Congress \nresponded by adopting the Fair Housing Act, which broadly declared that “[i]t is the policy of the \nUnited States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United \nStates.”  Pub. L. No. 90-284, title VIII, § 801, 82 Stat. 81 (Apr. 11, 1968).  In the words of President \nJohnson, the law “proclaims that fair housing for all – all human beings who live in this country – \nis now a part of the American way of life.”2 \n21.  To achieve that lofty goal, Congress outlawed discrimination in various aspects of \nhousing on the basis of “race, color, religion, or national origin.”  § 804, 82 Stat. at 83.   \n22.  Perhaps  anticipating  that  some  would  oppose  enforcement  of  the  FHA’s \nguarantees, Congress also included a broad anti-retaliation provision in that law.  In what is now \nSection 3617, Congress provided: “It shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere \nwith any person in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of his having exercised or enjoyed, \nor on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment \nof, any right granted or protected by section 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606 of this title.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3617  (emphasis  added).    In  adopting  this  provision,  one  legislator  explained:  “We  need \nlegislation to prevent interference with those pursuing their own civil rights or attempting to \neducate others about their rights.”  114 Cong. Rec. 9608 (Apr. 10, 1968) (Statement of Rep. \nBrown).   \n23.  As it reads today, the FHA prohibits, among other things, “refus[ing] to sell or rent \nafter the making of a bona fide offer,” “discriminat[ing] against any person in the terms, conditions, \n \n2 https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-upon-signing-the-civil-rights-act. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 7 of 37\nor privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,” and “discriminat[ing] against any person” in “making \navailable” or “in the terms and conditions” of “residential real estate-related transactions.”  42 \nU.S.C.  §§  3604,  3605.    The  FHA  was  amended  in  1988  to  include  protections  against \ndiscrimination based on sex, disability, and familial status.  See 42 U.S.C. § 3604. \n24.  Congress  has  provided  for  robust  enforcement  of  the  FHA  through  both \nadministrative and judicial means.  On the administrative side, Congress bestowed on HUD both \nthe “authority” and the “responsibility” for “administering” the FHA.  42 U.S.C. § 3608.  Congress \nalso directed that HUD “shall . . . administer the programs and activities relating to housing and \nurban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of” the Act.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3608(e)(5). \n25.  In providing for administrative enforcement of the FHA, Congress laid out a \ndetailed scheme by which HUD must abide.  In particular, HUD “shall make an investigation” of \ncomplaints that allege discriminatory housing practices, “shall . . . determine based on the facts \nwhether reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or \nis about to occur,” and, where reasonable cause is found to exist, “shall . . . immediately issue a \ncharge on behalf of the aggrieved person, for further proceedings” before the agency.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 3610.  Once a charge has been filed, HUD “shall provide an opportunity for a hearing on the \nrecord” before an administrative law judge.  42 U.S.C. § 3612(b). \n26.  HUD has adopted further regulations that govern how the agency discharges its \nstatutory enforcement obligations.  The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) is \nthe investigatory body responsible for, among other things, enforcing the Fair Housing Act.  See \nConsolidated Delegation of Authority for the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, 76 \nFed. Reg. 73984 (Nov. 29, 2011).  FHEO does so by processing and investigating complaints of \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 8 of 37\nhousing discrimination, performing compliance reviews, reviewing and commenting on proposed \nrules, guidance, and policy documents related to fair housing, and working with Congress on \npotential fair housing legislation.  See 24 C.F.R. subtitle B, Ch. 1, Pt. 103 (setting forth mandatory \ncomplaint and enforcement procedures that the agency must follow). \n27.  HUD regulations and delegations of authority impose specific enforcement-related \nduties on the agency’s General Counsel, such as approving subpoenas to be issued as part of the \nagency’s investigations, concurring with reasonable-cause determinations, issuing formal charges \nof discrimination, and prosecuting charges of discrimination in administrative hearings.  See 24 \nC.F.R. §§ 103.200(a)(3), 103.215(b), 103.400(a)(2)(i), 103.410(c), 180.305(a). \n28.  Within the Office of General Counsel (OGC), the Office of Fair Housing (OFH) \ncarries out work pursuant to the FHA.  OFH is one of nine Divisions of OGC headquartered in \nWashington, DC, and OFH is the only office at HUD headquarters responsible for affirmative fair \nhousing work.   \n29.  HUD OGC also includes Regional Counsel offices across the country.  Regional \nstaff are generalist attorneys who handle a wide variety of matters, including both affirmative and \ndefensive litigation, as well as regulatory and advisory work.  While FHA enforcement is included \namong regional counsel’s various responsibilities, fair housing matters make up only a small \nportion of the work done by regional offices, and OFH is the only HUD headquarters office that \nenforces the FHA.  As the agency’s fair housing specialists, OFH is responsible for reviewing all \nnovel and complex FHA cases handled by regional attorneys.  Each region is also assigned an \nOFH attorney to advise on FHA-related matters. \n30.  As part of its work, OFH advises and supports FHEO to enforce the FHA and to \nensure that HUD and grantees comply with fair housing requirements.  Attorneys in OFH also \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 9 of 37\nserve as fair housing subject matter experts for others across the agency.  In this role, OFH advises \nregional attorneys on their fair housing matters, trains investigators and regional attorneys, \ncompiles toolkits, and drafts guidance documents and fair housing regulations.  OFH also serves \nas fair housing counsel to all of HUD to ensure compliance with the FHA and other civil rights \nlaws. \n31.  Within  OFH,  the  Enforcement  Division  is  the  legal  office  responsible  for \naffirmative enforcement of the FHA.  The Compliance Division is primarily responsible for \nenforcement of other civil rights laws that apply to HUD grantees; in recent years, however, the \nCompliance Division has become more involved in affirmative FHA enforcement because many \ncomplaints allege violations of multiple civil rights laws, including the FHA.  The Compliance \nDivision additionally works with and advises FHEO to develop and conduct civil rights-related \ninvestigations, including under the FHA, relating to grantees’ programs and activities. \n32.  Because  of  HUD’s  mandatory  obligations  under  the  FHA  and  governing \nregulations, OFH’s enforcement workload is driven by the number of complaints that are filed \nwith the agency, not by the varying priorities of different administrations. \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Work at the Office of Fair Housing \n33.  Plaintiffs—five attorneys who work or used to work in OFH—have spent most or \nall of their HUD careers enforcing the FHA.  Several Plaintiffs also worked on fair housing matters \nprior to joining HUD.   \n34.  Plaintiff Palmer Heenan has worked in OFH’s Enforcement Division since he \njoined HUD in October 2023.  During his time at OFH, Mr. Heenan has been responsible for \ncharging  complaints  of  discrimination,  assisting  in  the  litigation  of  matters  before  HUD’s \nadministrative law judges, issuing investigatory subpoenas, issuing subpoenas for depositions, \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 10 of 37\nassisting in the conciliation of cases, conducting dozens of witness interviews, providing legal \nadvice to program offices throughout HUD with respect to their Fair Housing Act compliance \nobligations, and creating internal and external guidance documents to make sure both HUD and \nexternal parties, like housing providers, can accurately navigate their obligations under the FHA.  \nMr. Heenan’s supervisors and senior OGC officials have been aware of his work enforcing the \nFHA.  \n35.  Plaintiff Paul Osadebe has worked in OFH’s Enforcement Division since he joined \nHUD in March 2021.  During his time at OFH, Mr. Osadebe has investigated complaints of \nhousing discrimination, drafted charges of discrimination, drafted and defended regulations and \nagency actions related to civil rights, and worked with Congress on new laws addressing civil \nrights.  He has also represented fair housing complainants at certain stages of proceedings.  Mr. \nOsadebe’s supervisors and senior OGC officials have been aware of his work enforcing the FHA.  \n36.  Plaintiff Julia Dykstra joined OFH’s Enforcement Division in May 2020.  During \nher time at HUD, she has, among other things, drafted a regulation interpreting the FHA and \ndefended it in litigation, investigated claims of discrimination, issued charges of discrimination, \nassisted in conciliation of FHA complaints, drafted and issued investigatory subpoenas, advised \nFHEO on investigations under the FHA, drafted guidance under the FHA, and created toolkits for \ninvestigators for novel and complex cases.  Ms. Dykstra’s supervisors and senior OGC officials \nare and have been aware of her work enforcing the FHA. \n37.  Plaintiff Ashley Vazquez joined HUD through the legal honors program in 2022. \nShe began working on FHA enforcement matters during her legal honors rotations to the litigation \ndivision of the Office of Regional Counsel for Region IV, to OFH’s Enforcement division, and to \nOFH’s compliance division.  Ms. Vazquez expressed strong interest in working exclusively on fair \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 11 of 37\nhousing  matters  and  requested  that  one  of  the  OGC  officials  involved  in  the  challenged \nreassignments place Ms. Vazquez in OFH at the end of the honors program.  This request was \ngranted, and Ms. Vazquez relocated from Georgia to Washington, D.C. to work in OFH.  During \nher time in OFH, Ms. Vazquez has worked on multijurisdictional cases that involve an FHA claim \nalongside a compliance authority, most frequently cases involving the Violence Against Women \nAct (VAWA) and FHA.  Ms. Vazquez’s supervisors and senior OGC officials have been aware of \nher work enforcing the FHA. \n38.  Plaintiff Hannah Gordon joined HUD through the legal honors program in 2015.  \nShe was originally assigned to the OGC Office of Litigation.  Because Ms. Gordon came to HUD \nto be a civil rights attorney, she negotiated for and successfully obtained a voluntary transfer to \nOFH.  She has worked in OFH’s Compliance Division since 2016, first as an Attorney Advisor, \nand later as a Disability Law & Fair Housing Litigation Attorney.  In March 2024, Ms. Gordon \nwas promoted to Deputy Assistant General Counsel of Compliance, which is a supervisory \nposition.  During her time at OFH, Ms. Gordon worked on FHA enforcement matters, including \nadvising FHEO on investigations that involve multiple civil rights authorities, including the FHA; \ndrafting toolkits to assist FHEO with resolving multijurisdictional cases; reviewing Agency-wide \nrules, guidance, and policy documents for consistency with the FHA; and drafting guidance \ndocuments on specific areas of FHA compliance and enforcement.  Ms. Gordon’s supervisors and \nsenior OGC officials have been aware of her work enforcing the FHA. \n39.  Supervisors and OGC officials were aware that, as OFH attorneys, Plaintiffs’ \nworkload primarily consisted of affirmative fair housing enforcement.  These officials were aware \nof Plaintiffs’ FHA-related responsibilities based on, among other things: organization charts, office \ntitles, job titles, position descriptions, direct interactions with OFH staff, delegations of authority, \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 12 of 37\nbriefings by the Associate General Counsel for Fair Housing, bi-weekly reporting shared with \nOGC leadership regarding ongoing casework, internal reporting systems, requests to recruit and \nretain  law  students  and  legal  honors  attorneys  by  promoting  OFH  work,  and  the  annual \nperformance review process, which included detailed descriptions of Plaintiffs’ work, including \non FHA enforcement matters. \nIII.  Agency Leadership Targets OFH Attorneys \n40.  Since shortly after January 20, 2025, OFH attorneys have been subject to a strict \ngag order that prohibits them from engaging in any “external communications” without political \nleadership approval for each individual matter.  That approval has been granted only rarely, and \nrequests often linger for months without action.  The gag order was conveyed verbally by political \nleadership, with no written clarification or guidance.  OGC officials have interpreted this directive \nto mean that OFH is prohibited from communicating with any party to an investigation or any \nfederal agency, including the Department of Justice.  As a result of this directive, OFH attorneys \nhave been limited in their abilities to provide legal advice on matters for which they would \ntypically consult in the regular course of business.   \n41.  Throughout February and March, Plaintiffs became aware of downsizing efforts \nand potential Reductions in Force (RIFs) at HUD and OGC.  Plaintiffs and other employees faced \ngrowing pressure to resign their jobs through OPM’s “deferred resignation program.”  Many \nprobationary employees who did not accept deferred resignation were fired en masse, including \nthree  attorneys  at  OFH.    HUD  employees  received  several  emails  from  the  agency’s  HR \ndepartment that suggested or implied they could be impacted by upcoming layoffs.  One such \nemail instructed employees to check the accuracy of their employee records in advance of \nimpending RIFs.  Other concerning emails included offers to provide staff trainings about applying \nfor other jobs.  Several emails and FAQ meetings discussed the possibility of impending RIFs. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 13 of 37\n42.  Even though this pressure campaign to force federal employees out of their jobs \ntook place across federal agencies, Plaintiffs have reason to believe that OFH was especially \ntargeted because of the office’s work enforcing the FHA.  In mid-February, a spreadsheet that had \nbeen provided to senior agency leadership began circulating among HUD staff, which showed RIF \ntargets for various agency offices as directed by the Trump Administration’s newly-created \nDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE).  According to that spreadsheet, FHEO—the \ninvestigatory office responsible for FHA enforcement—would be cut by 77%.3     \n43.  On  information  and  belief,  agency  leadership  originally  intended  to  separate \neveryone in OFH by implementing a RIF limited to OFH specifically, but those plans ran into \nroadblocks.  Agency officials were advised that any RIF would have to apply across all of OGC, \nrather than to OFH alone, that it would be unlawful to conduct a so-called “box RIF” for the \npurpose of removing OFH attorneys, and that, in any case, many OFH attorneys would have \nsufficient seniority to remain with the agency even after a RIF.  \n44.  On information and belief, having been advised that an OFH-specific RIF would \nnot work, OGC officials looked for other ways to target OFH attorneys.  Unable to eliminate OFH \naltogether, OGC officials instead opted to use involuntary reassignments to achieve their goal—\nand the goal of political leadership and the Trump Administration more broadly—to significantly \nreduce the agency’s capacity to enforce the Fair Housing Act.  Motivated by unlawful animus \nagainst FHA enforcement and the people who do it, OGC officials selected OFH attorneys, \nincluding Plaintiffs, for involuntary reassignments.   \n \n3 https://apnews.com/article/doge-hud-trump-turner-affordable-housing-musk-0176c8539fa9b5\n959198c351c97b8652 \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 14 of 37\n45.  On or around May 20, 2025, an HR official in OGC sent a calendar invitation \nabruptly scheduling a meeting with OFH staff attorneys entitled “OGC Office Needs.”  The \nattorneys invited to the meeting did not receive any additional notice or explanation about its \npurpose or agenda.  The next day, the same official canceled the meeting with no explanation.  An \nOFH attorney replied to ask when the meeting would be rescheduled but received no response.   \n46.  Based on informal conversations, Plaintiffs and other OFH attorneys suspected that \nthe meeting had been scheduled to discuss downsizing OFH and/or potential reassignments to \nother offices.  Around the same time, OFH supervisors were informed that only staff attorneys \nwere being considered for any potential transfers. \n47.  On May 28, 2025, Plaintiff Ashley Vazquez met with an OGC official individually \nto discuss possible reassignments.  During that meeting, the OGC official stated that work-sharing \nto address OGC needs would not be approved because OFH was too big and needed to be “right-\nsized.”  The OGC official also stated that there were new administration priorities.  The OGC \nofficial informed Ms. Vazquez that she was free to transfer to any other OGC office in the country \nif she was willing to move and pay for her own relocation costs. \n48.  On or around May 29, 2025, an affected OFH attorney met with an OGC official \nindividually to discuss possible reassignments.  During that meeting, the OGC official stated that \nOFH attorneys had been selected to address staffing needs across OGC because fair housing is not \na priority of this administration, and OFH would not have as much work to do.  The OGC official \nfurther stated that leadership had directed that OGC fill the positions administratively rather than \nhiring new attorneys to replace those who had resigned or already been fired.  The OGC official \nprovided the affected attorney with many options of OGC offices to volunteer to be reassigned to, \nbeyond those that had initially been designated as needing staff.  At this meeting and in a follow-\n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 15 of 37\nup email, the affected attorney described their current workload to the OGC official, highlighting \nan increased caseload due to reduced capacity of FHEO and regional counsel, including losing all \nof their FHEO and regional counsel colleagues on two matters.  The attorney further explained the \ndifficult position of having to choose between their dedication to HUD and federal employment \nand their civil rights career, and that if reassigned, they would feel obligated to leave HUD, which \nwould not help solve the staffing needs of other OGC offices.  Instead, the attorney personally \noffered to volunteer for long-term work-sharing or a term-limited full time rotational assignment \nto another OGC office.  The OGC official said neither would be possible and acknowledged \nknowing that many people in OFH would leave HUD if reassigned. \n49.  On May 29, 2025, an HR official in OGC scheduled a meeting for the next day \nentitled “OGC Skills Gap.”  The meeting invitation included line attorneys from OFH and the \nOffice of Program Enforcement (OPE).   \n50.  On June 4, 2025, the “OGC Skills Gap” meeting was held.  OFH attorneys were \ntold that, to fill staffing needs, OGC was offering attorneys in OFH and OPE the opportunity to be \nvoluntarily reassigned to a list of other divisions.  For each division on the list, OGC officials \nstated that there was a specific number of attorney slots that supposedly needed to be filled.  OFH \nsupervisors had not previously been informed of these numbers or exactly how many staff \nattorneys agency leadership intended to reassign.  OFH attorneys were told that, if not enough \npeople volunteered by June 13, OGC officials would conduct involuntary reassignments.   \n51.  On June 9, 2025, OFH attorneys, including Plaintiffs Mr. Heenan, Mr. Osadebe, \nMs. Dykstra, and Ms. Vazquez, with the support of Plaintiff Ms. Gordon, emailed OGC officials \nto propose a work-sharing plan to meet what OGC officials had described as gaps in coverage, as \nan alternative to involuntary reassignments in the event there were not enough volunteers.  The \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 16 of 37\nproposal suggested term-limited rotational assignments in addition to attorneys taking on certain \nmatters for other offices while remaining in OFH.  Both work-sharing agreements and temporary \nrotations are common arrangements throughout OGC to meet staffing needs as they arise. \n52.  On June 12, 2025, an OGC official rejected the alternative proposal, stating that \noffice leadership believed asking for volunteers was the best option at that time.  The official did \nnot respond to follow-up questions OFH attorneys had sent in writing about the voluntary \nreassignment process.  \n53.  Only one attorney from OFH volunteered to transfer, and his transfer was approved \nto an office that was not one of the original options definitively conveyed by OGC officials at the \nJune 4 meeting.  The office to which that attorney was transferred indicated they were unaware \nthey would be receiving additional staff through the reassignments.      \n54.  On June 23, 2025, OGC officials verbally conveyed to the Associate General \nCounsel for Fair Housing that 10 line attorneys—including four of the Plaintiffs here—would be \ninvoluntarily transferred out of OFH.  On June 23, 2025, OGC officials also conveyed that two \nsupervisors in OFH (the Deputy Assistant General Counsel for Fair Housing Enforcement; and \nPlaintiff Hannah Gordon, Deputy Assistant General Counsel for Fair Housing Compliance) would \nbe demoted to trial attorneys and transferred out of OFH.  As far as Plaintiffs are aware, this was \nthe first time that OGC officials ever suggested that supervisors were being considered for \nreassignment.    The  proposed  reassignments  (12  attorneys),  along  with  the  attorney  who \nvolunteered to transfer, would cut approximately 50% of OFH’s staff at the time (13 out of 24).  \n55.  Later that day, in response to the proposed involuntary reassignments, one of the \ndeputies slated for transfer sent emails to OGC leadership and other OGC managers outlining his \nlegal,  programmatic,  and  practical  concerns  regarding  the  proposal.    In  the  email  to  OGC \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 17 of 37\nleadership, the deputy explained his view that the attorneys selected for transfer had been targeted \nin retaliation for their work on fair housing matters, and that OFH had been specifically targeted \nfor reduction because fair housing-related work is not in favor with current political leadership.  \nLess than one week later, the deputy was placed on administrative leave, and he was subsequently \nterminated on the basis of those emails. \n56.  Throughout this same time period, HUD officials sought to isolate OFH by cutting \ntheir roles with respect to other agency activities.  In May, OFH was removed from HUD’s internal \nclearance process, through which OFH had served for decades as civil rights counsel to the agency \nand advised programs and other offices with respect to legal risk, including under the FHA.  \nThroughout this same period, managers in other parts of HUD directed their staff on multiple \noccasions not to seek assistance from or consult with OFH or FHEO, despite many years of \nproductive collaboration in the past.  In addition, an OGC official instructed overburdened counsel \nin regional offices to stop referring cases to OFH or asking OFH for assistance. \n57.  Political  leadership  in  FHEO  also  recently  released  new  guidance  regarding \ninvestigatory procedures and a retraction of dozens of existing guidance documents, all without \nconsulting OFH.  This was done despite OFH normally taking a significant role in developing or \nretracting  any  guidance—indeed,  some  of  the  guidance  FHEO  purported  to  withdraw  was \ndeveloped over many years through careful collaboration between FHEO and OFH. \nIV.  Plaintiffs Were Targeted Because of Their Work Advancing Fair Housing Rights \n58.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs were targeted for involuntary reassignment \nbecause  of  their  work  enforcing  the  FHA.    That  work  necessarily  assisted,  aided,  and/or \nencouraged  other  people  in  the  exercise  or  enjoyment  of  their  fair  housing  rights.    The \nreassignments were motivated by an unlawful intent to interfere with Plaintiffs and their work \nadvancing fair housing rights.   \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 18 of 37\n59.  Statements by OGC officials and the way the reassignments have been carried out \nshow that the agency’s proffered justification was not credible and the reasons given for the \nreassignments were pretext for decisionmakers’ unlawful motivation.   \n60.  OGC  officials  have  repeatedly  stated  that  the  reassignments  were  necessary \nbecause “fair housing is not a priority” of this Administration and current agency leadership.  \nOGC officials also stated that, because fair housing is not a current priority, there would not be as \nmuch fair housing enforcement work to do going forward.  In explaining why reassignments were \nnecessary, one OGC official stated that there was “an optics problem” with OFH being the largest \noffice in OGC during this Administration.  Nothing was said about optics or priorities with respect \nto other offices in OGC.  Ms. Vazquez had also been told by an OGC official that alternatives to \nforced reassignments would not be approved because OFH was too big and should be “right-\nsized.” \n61.  Even  before  Plaintiffs’  reassignments,  OFH  faced  a  significant  backlog  of \nstatutorily mandated enforcement work.  Because OGC’s regional offices have lost so many staff \nin recent months, especially on the litigation side, OFH has been receiving increased requests from \nregional counsel to assist on fair housing matters.  OFH has also been carrying increased workloads \nin light of significant staff shortages at FHEO.  Despite statements about administration priorities, \nthe number of investigations and complaints that must be processed—which determines the \nworkload for OFH—has not decreased.   \n62.  In addition, OFH has been managing new workstreams arising out of the new \nAdministration’s  priorities,  including  implementation  of  Executive  Orders  and  review  of \napplications for fair housing assistance grants that were submitted after the Administration \namended the solicitation for applications consistent with its priorities.  On information and belief, \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 19 of 37\nnone of the offices to which Plaintiffs and their colleagues have been or will be transferred have \nbacklogs or capacity issues that are any more urgent or severe than at OFH.  OFH attorneys have \nbeen told that, in executing the reassignments, OGC officials “were thinking of needs of all offices \nexcept OFH.”   \n63.  Much of Plaintiffs’ work as attorneys in OFH enforcing the Fair Housing Act is \nmandated by that statute.  The job functions that Plaintiffs will perform once reassigned, by \ncontrast, are either not statutorily required, as far as Plaintiffs are aware, or there are others in OGC \nwho are already trained in these areas and could do this work. \n64.  OGC officials have offered contradictory explanations about the unmet needs that \nsupposedly justified the reassignments.  At times, including when they requested volunteers, OGC \nofficials expressed that reassignments were necessary to fill specific positions, providing a list of \nthe number of slots in each division that needed attorneys.  At other times, however, OGC officials \nsuggested that the reassignments were necessary solely to move people out of OFH—regardless \nof the office they transfer to.   \n65.  Plaintiffs reasonably believed that they would be permitted to transfer to almost \nany other division in OGC, as long as they did not stay in OFH, due to OGC officials’ having \nidentified the size of OFH as an “optics problem,” and as evidenced by OGC officials moving an \nOFH attorney who requested voluntary reassignment to a division other than those definitively \nidentified in the June 4 meeting.  Plaintiffs’ reasonable belief was also based on conversations \nwhere OGC officials seemed open to transfers to other offices.  \n66.  OGC officials did not involuntarily reassign attorneys from any offices other than \nOFH and OPE, even though there were other divisions that also had lost relatively few staff in \nrecent months.   \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 20 of 37\n67.  The number of staff that were ultimately reassigned is more than OGC officials \ninitially indicated would be necessary to address staffing needs.  For example, the Office of Ethics \nand Appeals initially requested 2–3 attorneys, partially informed by the need to perform a function \nthat has since been offloaded to another office.  2 OGC employees from outside OFH volunteered \nto be transferred to Ethics, yet 2 additional attorneys from OFH are still being transferred.  \nSimilarly, the Office of Litigation initially requested 4–5 attorneys, but that office is now receiving \n8 additional staff, including 5 involuntary transfers from OFH.  OFH supervisors were shocked at \nthe number of attorneys that OGC decided to reassign. \n68.  The offices to which Plaintiffs and their colleagues in OFH have been reassigned \nare not a good match for their skills and experience, especially compared to regional attorneys at \nOGC who already do that work.  Plaintiffs and their colleagues in OFH are experts in fair housing \nand civil rights law, which is a unique and highly specialized field.  Individual OFH attorneys have \nexpertise and historical knowledge in certain areas of fair housing and civil rights law that will be \nlost and cannot be replaced if they are removed from their OFH positions.  Their practice is also \nprimarily comprised of affirmative enforcement, which is materially different work than the types \nof defensive litigation, ethics reviews, and personnel matters that Plaintiffs and their colleagues \nwill be expected to carry out once reassigned.  OGC staff in HUD’s regional offices, however, \nalready work on and have expertise in defensive litigation, ethics, and personnel matters, and thus \nwould be better suited to that work than Plaintiffs.  Because Plaintiffs and their colleagues have \nlittle to no experience in the areas and fields to which they are being transferred, they will require \nsubstantial training and supervision to match the expertise already held by regional attorneys.  \nOGC officials nevertheless ordered that Plaintiffs and their colleagues in OFH be reassigned to \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 21 of 37\naddress needs in other OGC divisions, rather than redistribute that work among already-trained \nattorneys without regard to the needs of OFH.   \n69.  Despite OGC officials’ insistence that Plaintiffs’ reassignments were necessary to \naddress significant staffing shortages at OGC, on information and belief, agency leadership never \nsought an exemption from the hiring freeze that would have allowed OGC to hire additional \nattorneys for these positions.  On information and belief, other parts of HUD and other federal \nagencies have requested and/or received permission to hire additional personnel. \n70.  OGC officials acknowledged their belief that at least some OFH attorneys would \nprobably quit their jobs at HUD if reassigned to other divisions because their priority is doing fair \nhousing work.  This further attrition at OGC would exacerbate the staffing needs that OGC officials \nwere  supposedly  trying  to  address.    When  Ms.  Gordon  asked  an  OGC  official  about  this \ncontradiction, the OGC official told her they would just hire more people for the other offices if \nthe reassigned OFH attorneys quit.   \n71.  OGC  officials  never  tried  to  fill  the  positions  to  which  Plaintiffs  and  their \ncolleagues in OFH have been involuntarily reassigned by advertising those positions across OGC \nto solicit volunteers from other divisions.   \n72.  In  the  Office  of  Litigation,  one  of  the  divisions  to  which  Plaintiffs  will  be \ntransferred, former employees who had been fired in their probationary terms or accepted deferred \nresignation were willing to return and continue carrying out their work.  OGC leadership did not \nallow any of these attorneys to return to address the purported staff shortage, choosing to \ninvoluntarily reassign Plaintiffs instead.   \n73.  OGC officials rejected a detailed alternative proposal offered by Plaintiffs and their \ncolleagues that would have allowed OFH staff to help other OGC divisions address critical needs, \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 22 of 37\nwhile also continuing to carry out their fair housing work at the same time.  The types of work-\nsharing and detail arrangements that OFH attorneys proposed are used within OGC and elsewhere \nin the agency.  In the process of carrying out the reassignments, an OGC official told Ms. Gordon \nthat she could start working in her reassigned position before her transfer date, acknowledging that \nthe allegedly critical work needs that justified the reassignments can be done across OGC offices.  \nManagers in some of the offices to which Plaintiffs have been reassigned have indicated that they \nwould be open to work-sharing arrangements to address staff shortages.  OGC officials did not \noffer any reasoned or concrete explanation as to why they rejected the proposal or did not believe \nit would be effective in meeting their purported needs.   \n74.  With respect to the supervisors whose reassignments outside of OFH have already \ntaken effect, including Plaintiff Ms. Gordon, OGC officials have offered shifting and contradictory \nexplanations for why those transfers were necessary and taking place on an expedited timeframe.  \nSupervisors were not solicited to volunteer to leave OFH, like staff were.  The day the involuntary \nreassignments were announced was the first time OFH attorneys became aware that supervisors \nwere being considered for transfer.  Around that time, one OGC official first represented that the \nsupervisors were being moved because they were non-bargaining-unit employees, and bargaining \nunit employees could not be moved to some of the new positions.  The official then acknowledged \nthat bargaining unit employees could be moved, but it would take longer, so the supervisors were \nchosen because their lack of bargaining rights made it faster.  OGC officials later said the \nsupervisors were best positioned to do the work in other OGC offices, given their supervisory \nexperience,  even  though  OGC  officials  acknowledged  the  supervisors  had  no  substantive \nknowledge in the relevant subject areas.  At another point, the supervisors were told they were \nbeing transferred because of their seniority and skills.   \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 23 of 37\n75.  The reassignments have been plagued by paperwork and processing errors and \ndelays.  On what was supposed to be Ms. Gordon’s first day in her reassigned position, she reported \nto work for the new job, only to find that she had not in fact been reassigned.  She was not informed \nuntil the next day that her start date had been delayed by two weeks.  On the day her reassignment \nappears  to  have  become  effective,  Ms.  Gordon  received  no  further  notice  or  paperwork \ndocumenting her transfer; she was only aware that the reassignment had taken effect when she \nreceived an email from her new supervisor about a staff meeting that day.  It then took another \nweek for Ms. Gordon’s computer systems and electronic accounts to be transferred.  She is still \nlisted as the first-line supervisor for attorneys in the Compliance Division in the agency’s internal \ntime-keeping system. \n76.  On more than one occasion, OGC officials have suggested that the reassignments \nmight only be temporary, and that affected attorneys may be able to return to OFH in the future.  \nThe week before OGC officials asked OFH attorneys to volunteer to be transferred, an OGC \nofficial told one of the attorneys that the official’s goal was to keep as many OGC staff as possible \n“for three to four years,” so that they could rebuild together.  On other occasions, OGC officials \nvaguely  suggested  that  even  though  the  reassignments  were  permanent  for  now,  impacted \nattorneys would likely be able to move back to OFH at some point in the future.  These statements \nsuggest that decisionmakers’ animus was tied to current political leadership at the agency and \nacross the federal government.   \n77.  On information and belief, OPE, the only other office subject to involuntary \nreassignments, was included in the reassignments primarily to deflect from decisionmakers’ \nunlawful motivation under the FHA. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 24 of 37\n78.  Before the transition in presidential administration earlier this year, OFH was \ncomprised of 31 staff members.  Following the termination of probationary employees, ongoing \nspeculation about impending RIFs, and the offer of deferred resignation, OFH was left with 24 \npeople.  As a result of the involuntary reassignments of Plaintiffs and their colleagues, OFH will \nbe left with only 11 staff (including only 6 line attorneys)—representing a nearly 70% cut of fair \nhousing staff from the beginning of the year.     \nV.  Plaintiffs’ Reassignments and Harms \n79.  Plaintiff Palmer Heenan was orally informed on or about June 24, 2025, that his \nmanagement team had received notice he was being moved to the Office of Litigation.  Mr. Heenan \ndid not receive written notice of his reassignment. \n80.  On July 3, 2025, Mr. Heenan’s union was notified—in a letter backdated to July 1, \n2025—that management was proposing involuntary reassignments, with an effective date of July \n28, 2025.  Mr. Heenan did not receive written notice of his proposed reassignment.  \n81.  On July 16, 2025, Mr. Heenan received an e-mail from an HR official that indicated \nthe official had been tasked with assisting Mr. Heenan with a “voluntary reassignment” and \nrequesting his resume.  Mr. Heenan had not volunteered to be reassigned and still had not received \nwritten notice of his reassignment.  \n82.  Mr. Heenan received written notice that he was being reassigned on September 15, \n2025, with an effective date of October 5, 2025.  In the formal written notification, Mr. Heenan \nwas told that he must complete the “Statement of Acknowledgement and Acceptance” of the \nreassignment or be “subject to removal from the Federal service.” \n83.  On information and belief, Defendants took this adverse action against Mr. Heenan \nbecause of his work at OFH enforcing the Fair Housing Act, of which senior officials and relevant \ndecisionmakers were aware.   \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 25 of 37\n84.  Mr. Heenan has been irreparably harmed by his reassignment.  The new position to \nwhich Mr. Heenan will be assigned is a new and different job from his current role in OFH’s \nEnforcement Division.  Mr. Heenan does not possess knowledge about the substance of the new \nposition, which may impact his ability to obtain positive performance reviews and any benefits \nassociated with such reviews.  \n85.  Mr. Heenan has dedicated the majority of his legal career to advocacy for and on \nbehalf of those whose civil rights have been violated.  He has spent years acquiring both the \nnecessary knowledge and skill to be an effective civil rights attorney.  He has taught numerous \nContinuing Legal Education Courses on civil rights enforcement.  He has also lectured law school \nclasses on civil rights and, in particular, the governmental role in the enforcement of civil rights \nlaws.  As a result of this reassignment, Mr. Heenan will no longer be able to do the civil rights \nwork to which he has committed his professional career.  Losing the opportunity to do that work \nmaterially disadvantages Mr. Heenan, his career, and his professional opportunities \n86.  Plaintiff Paul Osadebe was orally informed on or about June 24, 2025, that his \nmanagement team had received notice he was being moved to the Office of Litigation. Mr. \nOsadebe did not receive written notice of his reassignment.   \n87.  On July 3, 2025, Mr. Osadebe’s union was notified—in a letter backdated to July \n1, 2025—that management was proposing involuntary reassignments, with an effective date of \nJuly 28, 2025.  Mr. Osadebe did not receive written notice of his proposed reassignment.  \n88.  On July 16, 2025, Mr. Osadebe received an e-mail from an HR official that \nindicated the official had been tasked with assisting Mr. Osadebe with a “voluntary reassignment” \nand requesting his resume.  Mr. Osadebe had not volunteered to be reassigned and still had not \nreceived written notice of his reassignment.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 26 of 37\n89.  Mr. Osadebe received written notice that he was being reassigned on September \n15, 2025, with an effective date of October 5, 2025.  In the formal written notification, Mr. Osadebe \nwas told that he must complete the “Statement of Acknowledgement and Acceptance” of the \nreassignment or be “subject to removal from the Federal service.” \n90.  On information and belief, Defendants took this adverse action against Mr. Osadebe \nbecause of his work at OFH enforcing the Fair Housing Act, of which senior officials and relevant \ndecisionmakers were aware.   \n91.  Mr. Osadebe has been irreparably harmed by his reassignment.  Due to values Mr. \nOsadebe has held dear since before even entering college, Mr. Osadebe’s career goal and reason \nfor becoming a lawyer was to work on impactful civil rights litigation.  Mr. Osadebe left his family \nand friends in Texas to move across the country to Washington D.C. to pursue opportunities to \nengage in affirmative civil rights litigation.  All of Mr. Osadebe’s legal experience has been \nfocused on affirmative public interest litigation on behalf of individuals and communities.  Mr. \nOsadebe has avoided any job with significant defensive litigation responsibilities because such \nwork would conflict with his values.  Mr. Osadebe would not have become a lawyer to perform \ncivil rights work and would have chosen a different career entirely if he knew he would be asked \nto perform defensive litigation against vulnerable individuals and communities.  The new position \nto which Mr. Osadebe will be assigned is a new and different job from his current role in OFH’s \nEnforcement Division.  As a result of his reassignment, Mr. Osadebe will no longer be able to do \nthe civil rights work to which he has committed his professional career.  Losing the opportunity to \ndo that work is an adverse action that materially disadvantages Mr. Osadebe, his career, and his \nprofessional opportunities.   \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 27 of 37\n92.  Mr. Osadebe has also suffered and will continue to suffer fear about how he will be \nevaluated doing work he is unfamiliar with in a new office, the type of training he will receive to \nperform this unfamiliar work, concern about being forced to restart his career with a different and \nunwanted focus several years in, and internal conflict about being expected to perform defensive \nlitigation work that conflicts with his values. Due to the stress surrounding his impending \nreassignment, Mr. Osadebe has sought increased mental health treatment and has even sought \ntreatment from an urgent care facility and the emergency room for likely symptoms of panic \nattacks caused by the stress. \n93.  Plaintiff Julia Dykstra was orally informed on or about June 24, 2025, that her \nmanagement team had received notice she was being moved to the Office of Litigation.   \n94.  On July 3, 2025, Ms. Dykstra’s union—in a letter backdated to July 1, 2025—that \nmanagement was proposing involuntary reassignments, with an effective date of July 28, 2025.  \nMs. Dykstra did not receive written notice of her proposed reassignment.  \n95.  On July 16, 2025, Ms. Dykstra received an e-mail from an HR official that indicated \nthe official had been tasked with assisting Ms. Dykstra with a “voluntary reassignment” and \nrequesting her resume.  Ms. Dykstra had not volunteered to be reassigned and still had not received \nwritten notice of her reassignment.  \n96.  Ms. Dykstra received written notice of her reassignment on September 16, 2025,4 \nwith an effective date of October 5, 2025.  In the formal written notification, Ms. Dykstra was told \nthat she must complete the “Statement of Acknowledgement and Acceptance” of the reassignment \nor be “subject to removal from the Federal service.” \n \n4 The email was sent on September 15, 2025, but Ms. Dykstra’s tour of duty had ended for the \nday, so she did not receive it until September 16, 2025. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 28 of 37\n97.  On information and belief, Defendants took this adverse action against Ms. Dykstra \nbecause of her work at OFH enforcing the Fair Housing Act, of which senior officials and relevant \ndecisionmakers were aware. \n98.  Ms. Dykstra has been irreparably harmed by this reassignment.  Ms. Dykstra went \nto law school specifically to pursue a career doing affirmative civil rights work, having been \ninspired by her undergraduate coursework where she studied, among other things, inequality in \naccess to housing.  Virtually all of Ms. Dykstra’s internships in law school and post-graduate \npositions prior to joining HUD were positions doing affirmative civil rights work.  She has \ndedicated years acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge to be an effective affirmative civil \nrights lawyer.  As a result of this reassignment, Ms. Dykstra has been irreparably harmed because \nshe will no longer be able to perform the work that she spent years training to do and will instead \nbe placed in a position where she is effectively a beginner.  Losing this opportunity materially \ndisadvantages her in her career and she is concerned that her performance reviews, and any \nassociated benefits, will be lower because she does not have experience in her new role.  Finally, \nshe also has experienced increased anxiety about being forced to conduct work that conflicts with \nher values. \n99.  Plaintiff Ashley Vazquez was informed on or about June 24, 2025, that her \nmanagement team had received notice she was being moved to the Office of Ethics and Appeals.   \n100.  On July 3, 2025, Ms. Vazquez’s union—in a letter backdated to July 1, 2025—was \nnotified that management was proposing involuntary reassignments, with an effective date of July \n28, 2025.  Ms. Vazquez did not receive written notice of her proposed reassignment.  \n101.  On July 16, 2025, Ms. Vazquez received an e-mail from an HR official that \nindicated the official had been tasked with assisting Ms. Vazquez with a “voluntary reassignment” \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 29 of 37\nand requesting her resume.  Ms. Vazquez had not volunteered to be reassigned and still had not \nreceived written notice of her reassignment.  \n102.  Ms. Vazquez received written notice of her reassignment on September 15, 2025, \nwith an effective date of October 5, 2025.  In the formal written notification, Ms. Vazquez was \ntold  that  she  must  complete  the  “Statement  of  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance”  of  the \nreassignment or be “subject to removal from the Federal service.” \n103.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendants  took  this  adverse  action  against  Ms. \nVazquez because of her work at OFH enforcing the Fair Housing Act, of which senior officials \nand relevant decisionmakers were aware. \n104.  Ms. Vazquez will be irreparably harmed by this reassignment.  Ms. Vazquez is a \ndues-paying member of the union AFGE Council 222, Local 476.  As result of this reassignment, \nshe will lose her status in the bargaining unit.  She will lose the benefits of her union membership, \nwhich include numerous procedural rights, substantive protections, and financial benefits.   \n105.  Ms. Vazquez’s career will be irreparably damaged by this reassignment.  Ms. \nVazquez chose to attend a particular law school in order to gain tangible experience related to \nsystemic discrimination associated with historic patterns of segregation.  Based on her extensive \ncivil rights enforcement experience, Ms. Vazquez believes that the federal government has a \nunique ability and responsibility to address systemic discrimination through civil rights laws, and \nthat HUD’s tools for enforcing civil rights are stronger than any other agency due to the strength \nof the Fair Housing Act.  Ms. Vazquez’s intent when applying to HUD’s legal honors program \nwas to work on FHA and other civil rights enforcement.  She moved twice in two years to new \ncities that she had no connection to in order to do this work, leaving behind family and friends and \nincurring significant financial costs. \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 30 of 37\n106.  During her time in OFH, Ms. Vazquez has worked on multijurisdictional cases \ninvolving the intersection of the FHA with VAWA, Title VI, and Section 504.  In these cases, she \nhas drafted FHA charges, negotiated with parties to encourage fair settlements, issued subpoenas, \nand  drafted  settlement  agreements.    Ms.  Vazquez’s  Compliance  role  afforded  additional \nopportunities to investigate widespread discrimination and issue letters of finding, and to advise \non program compliance with civil rights laws, resulting in HUD programs being less likely to \ndiscriminate.  This reassignment will prevent her from continuing to build upon those experiences, \nstunt her career growth, and prevent her from becoming a subject matter expert in the type of law \nshe went to law school to pursue.  The Office of Ethics and Appeals is a completely different type \nof law than what Ms. Vazquez has been practicing.  Cutting short Ms. Vazquez’s opportunity to \ncontinue building litigation skills will also adversely affect her opportunities to find meaningful \ncivil rights work outside the government. \n107.  Ms. Vazquez has suffered significant anguish over having to abandon her cases. \nUnder significant stress, Ms. Vazquez has lost sleep and worked additional hours to maximize her \nimpact on her cases before she is reassigned.  Ms. Vazquez’s religious beliefs require her to engage \nin the type of work she has been doing at OFH.  As such, she has had to seek religious counsel and \ndevote significant personal time to reflecting on the teaching of her faith and trying to stop her \nreassignment from proceeding. \n108.  Plaintiff Hannah Gordon was first informed on June 23, 2025, that she would be \ndemoted from her supervisory position and involuntarily reassigned to the Personnel Law Division \nin the Office of Ethics and Personnel Law.  Ms. Gordon received official written notice of her \ntransfer on June 30, 2025.  On information and belief, agency officials took this action against Ms. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 31 of 37\nGordon because of her work at OFH enforcing civil rights laws including the Fair Housing Act, of \nwhich senior officials and relevant decisionmakers were aware.   \n109.  Ms. Gordon has been working in her reassigned position since July 27, 2025.  In \nher new position, Ms. Gordon was not assigned any work until August 6.  Now that she has been \nassigned work, most of it does not have pressing deadlines.  She was also told that a regional office \nhad capacity to help her with any of her assigned cases.  She has, however, been permitted to \ncontinue doing some of her prior work from OFH that is unrelated to enforcing the Fair Housing \nAct.  Specifically, after she was moved, she was directed to continue her prior workstreams \nproviding legal advice on reasonable accommodation requests from HUD employees, for which \nshe is still supervised by her OFH supervisors.  But she has not been permitted to continue working \non any FHA-specific enforcement matters.   \n110.  Ms. Gordon has been irreparably harmed by her reassignment.  Ms. Gordon’s new \nsupervisor has acknowledged that the work she will be assigned in the Personnel Office is “a \ncomplete 180” from the affirmative enforcement work she was doing before in OFH.  Ms. Gordon \njoined HUD and OFH to work on civil rights matters, including enforcement of the Fair Housing \nAct, that align with her values and make her work meaningful and fulfilling.  Losing the \nopportunity  to  do  that  work  due  to  her  reassignment  is  an  adverse  action  that  materially \ndisadvantages Ms. Gordon, her career, and her professional opportunities.   \n111.  Ms. Gordon has devoted her entire career, even before becoming a lawyer, to civil \nrights advocacy and equal rights.  In law school, she was chosen for a selective public interest \nscholars and scholarship program based on her vow to devote her career to this type of work.   \n112.  This is the second time since being at HUD that Ms. Gordon has had to advocate to \nbe assigned to OFH.  Ms. Gordon thought she was being assigned to the civil rights office when \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 32 of 37\nshe first joined HUD, only to learn when she started that the work would be defensive civil rights \nwork.  After months of lobbying then-HUD leadership, Ms. Gordon was finally voluntarily \ntransferred to OFH, in large part thanks to the intervention of a senior OGC official who has since \npassed away.  It is distressing for Ms. Gordon to have to relive that prior experience. \n113.  Ms. Gordon has also suffered and will continue to suffer severe emotional distress \nand anxiety from this reassignment.  She has expressed this to OGC leadership and her new \nsupervisor, and their response was to tell her to “keep an open mind.”  She is afraid of being forced \nto take positions that will violate her personal morals and her professional responsibilities.  Ms. \nGordon has not received formal training in her new role, and she is greatly concerned about \nviolating a professional responsibility by practicing in an area of law she is unfamiliar with without \nproper training.  She is also fearful of the lost opportunities and knowledge she will suffer from \nworking in an area of law that is completely unrelated to her career.   \n114.  Ms. Gordon’s career is also damaged by the demotion from her supervisor position.  \nAlready on multiple occasions, Ms. Gordon has been forced to explain that she was demoted and \nhas tried to explain that it was not for performance or conduct-related reasons.   \n115.  Plaintiffs’  unlawful  reassignments  have  also  caused  and  continue  to  cause \nadditional  harm  by  chilling  the  advancement  of  fair  housing  rights.    Victims  of  housing \ndiscrimination will suffer when their complaints are not timely and properly addressed by HUD.  \nIf agency officials are permitted to take adverse action against Plaintiffs based on their work \nenforcing the FHA, then employees across the country—both public and private—will be more \nreluctant to accept positions or assignments that advance fair housing, for fear that they could be \npunished for doing so.  Moreover, victims of housing discrimination under the FHA will be less \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 33 of 37\nlikely to file claims if they believe the agency charged with reviewing those claims is free to \ninterfere with fair housing enforcement and itself violate the FHA. \nVI.  The Trump Administration’s Hostility Towards Fair Housing and Civil Rights \n116.  The Trump Administration and senior HUD officials have long harbored animus \ntoward fair housing work and the civil rights attorneys who do it.  This animus informed and \nmotivated Defendants’ targeting of Plaintiffs based on their work enforcing the FHA. \n117.  Since President Trump was inaugurated earlier this year, the Administration has \neliminated or dramatically cut civil rights offices in other agencies, including the Social Security \nAdministration,  the  Labor  Department,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  the  Department  of \nHomeland Security, and the Department of Education.5   \n118.  At HUD, the Administration has sought to weaken the enforcement of fair housing \nlaws in various ways.  HUD officials have withheld meritorious discrimination charges, and “at \nleast 115 federal fair housing cases have been halted or closed entirely since Trump took office.”6  \nIn addition, multiple channels for reporting housing discrimination have been shut down.7  And it \nwas reported in July that HUD was ending at least seven major investigations where HUD had \n“already found civil rights violations.”8 \n119.  Recent reporting documents ongoing efforts by the Trump Administration to limit \nenforcement of the FHA.9 \n \n5 https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/28/doge-trump-civil-rights-office-closing-\neeoc/; https://www.propublica.org/article/education-department-civil-rights-division-eroded-by-\nmassive-layoffs; https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5336738/homeland-security-rif-cuts-dhs \n6 https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-hud-weakening-enforcement-fair-housing-laws. \n7 Id. \n8 https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-hud-drop-housing-discrimination-cases-housing-\npollution. \n9 https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/realestate/trump-fair-housing-laws.html. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 34 of 37\n120.  Also notable was the effort by DOGE to purge references to protected classes from \ngovernment websites, even though race and other disfavored words are closely associated with \nstatutory anti-discrimination mandates.10  At HUD, the Administration directed that everything \nabout fair housing be removed except for what a statute specifically said must be included. \n121.  This scrutiny also fell on fair housing grantees.  For example, one attorney was \nmade aware that HUD offices had been instructed to search grantee websites and LinkedIn profiles \nfor commonly used civil rights terms like “race” and “segregation.”  On information and belief, \nthese efforts were used to cancel grants worth millions of dollars.11 \n122.  Recent agency memoranda issued by political leadership in FHEO appear designed \nto undermine FHA enforcement by limiting the types of evidence investigators may consider, \neliminating long-standing legal theories under which they can investigate cases, and imposing \nadditional bureaucratic requirements on an office that is already understaffed. \n123.  Project 2025—which has informed many of the Trump Administration’s policies \nand  initiatives—criticized  HUD’s  prior  fair  housing  enforcement  efforts  as  misguided  and \nineffective.12   \n124.  Even as far back as the 2020 presidential election, President Trump campaigned on \na promise to roll back programs under the Fair Housing Act aimed at reducing racial segregation \nin suburban housing.13 \n \n10 https://www.npr.org/2025/03/19/nx-s1-5317567/federal-websites-lgbtq-diversity-erased. \n11 https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-trump-administration-\nunlawfully-cancelled-grants-intended. \n12 https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-\nthe-conservative-promise/, at 510–511. \n13 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/politics/trump-suburbs-housing-white-voters.html. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 35 of 37\n125.  The  Administration  is  of  course  entitled  to  its  own  policy  preferences.    But \ngovernment officials may not pursue those objectives through the unlawful targeting of fair \nhousing attorneys. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT 1: VIOLATION OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT – 42 U.S.C. § 3617 \n(ON BEHALF OF EACH PLAINTIFF; AS TO ALL DEFENDANTS) \n \n126.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs. \n127.  Plaintiffs bring this claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A). \n128.  42 U.S.C. § 3617 provides: “It shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or \ninterfere with any person . . . on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the \nexercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected by section 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606 of \nthis title.”  As HUD regulations recognize, this provision of the FHA prohibits “[t]hreatening an \nemployee . . . with dismissal or an adverse employment action, or taking such adverse employment \naction, for any effort to assist a person seeking access to the sale or rental of a dwelling or seeking \naccess  to  any  residential  real  estate-related  transaction,  because  of”  certain  protected \ncharacteristics.  24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3). \n129.  Defendants,  through  OGC  officials,  coerced,  intimidated,  threatened  and/or \ninterfered with Plaintiffs’ employment at OGC because of Plaintiffs’ work aiding, assisting, and/or \nencouraging other people in the exercise or enjoyment of their fair housing rights under the FHA.   \n130.  Plaintiffs reviewed, processed, investigated, conciliated, charged, managed, and/or \nresolved complainants’ claims of housing discrimination under the Fair Housing Act.  Plaintiffs \nalso were responsible for participating in administrative proceedings at HUD under the Fair \nHousing Act to resolve charges of discrimination.  In addition, Plaintiffs consulted with other \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 36 of 37\noffices at HUD and drafted and reviewed guidance, policy proposals, and other agency materials \nto ensure that the agency did not violate people’s fair housing rights under the FHA.   \n131.  Defendants, through OGC officials, were aware of Plaintiffs’ activities aiding, \nassisting, and/or encouraging other people in the exercise or enjoyment of their fair housing rights \nunder the FHA.  \n132.  As a result of Plaintiffs’ work aiding, assisting, and/or encouraging other people in \nthe exercise or enjoyment of their fair housing rights under the FHA, Defendants, through OGC \nofficials, coerced, intimidated, threatened, and/or interfered with Plaintiffs’ employment at OGC \nby pressuring them to resign, coercing them to transfer to other offices, and when none of that \nworked, involuntarily reassigning Plaintiffs to offices outside of OFH and requiring them to accept \nthe reassignments under threat of removal from federal service. \n133.  Plaintiffs’ involuntary reassignments are an adverse action because they require \nPlaintiffs to transfer offices and do work that is meaningfully different from the civil rights-related \nwork that they joined HUD to do.  The reassignments would dissuade a reasonable person from \njoining OFH or working on fair housing enforcement matters, for fear that they likewise will be \ntargeted for involuntary reassignment or other adverse action.   \n134.  Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm absent an \ninjunction. \n135.  Plaintiffs have attempted to address their concerns with management and other \nOGC officials, but Defendants have nevertheless proceeded with the involuntary reassignments.  \nPlaintiffs fear further retaliation as a result of their efforts to oppose Defendants’ unlawful actions. \nCOUNT 2: DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT \n(ON BEHALF OF EACH PLAINTIFF; AS TO ALL DEFENDANTS) \n \n136.  Plaintiffs reincorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1–125. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03343     Document 1     Filed 09/22/25     Page 37 of 37\n137.
