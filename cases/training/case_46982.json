Action No. ___________ \n  v.   \n   \nMUKWONAGO AREA SCHOOL \nDISTRICT and JOE KOCH, in his official \ncapacity as Superintendent of the Mukwonago \nArea School District, \n \n      Defendant. \n \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n1.  Jane Doe #1 (“Plaintiff”), by her mother and next friend Jane Doe #2, bring this \nComplaint against the Mukwonago Area School District (“MASD”) and Superintendent Joe \nKoch (“Superintendent Koch” or “Koch”) in his official capacity (collectively, “Defendants”), \nfor a temporary restraining order and permanent injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, and \ndamages to redress Defendants’ ongoing denial of Jane Doe #1’s rights under Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq., (“Title IX”) and the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (“Equal Protection \nClause”). Contrary to controlling precedent in the Seventh Circuit, Defendants are prohibiting \nJane Doe #1, an eleven-year-old transgender girl, from using the school restrooms that accord \nwith her gender identity, i.e., the girls’ restrooms. \nINTRODUCTION \n2.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, an eleven-year-old girl, is a student in the MASD’s summer \nschool program and will be a sixth grade student at MASD’s Prairie View Elementary School \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 1 of 20   Document 1\n\n \n(“Prairie View”) in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, when the regular school year begins in early \nSeptember. Jane Doe #1 is a girl. She is also transgender. Jane Doe #1 was assumed to be a boy \nwhen she was born and was designated “male” on her birth certificate, but she has a female \ngender identity and lives as a girl in all aspects of her life. Jane Doe #1’s family, friends, medical \nproviders, and others recognize Jane Doe #1 as a girl, respect her female gender identity, and \nsupport her right to live and be treated consistent with that gender identity. \n3.  Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 moved to the school district when the former was in \nthird grade. From third grade through most of fifth grade, Jane Doe #1 used the girls’ bathrooms \nat Prairie View without incident or controversy, and with support from the adults in the school.  \n4.  Since approximately May of 2023, however, Defendants MASD and Koch have \ntaken—and continue to implement—a series of discriminatory and highly stigmatizing actions \nagainst Jane Doe #1 based on her sex, gender identity, and transgender status. The actions, \ndescribed more fully herein, include (a) applying shifting policies that have in common the \ndenial of her access to girls’ restrooms at school and the requirement that she use boys’ or mens’ \nrestrooms or a single-occupancy purportedly gender-neutral restroom; (b) directing school staff \nto monitor her restroom usage at summer school; and (c) threatening disciplinary action if she \ncontinues to use the girls’ restroom at summer school. \n5.  Through these actions, Defendants have discriminated and continue to actively \ndiscriminate against Jane Doe #1 on the basis of sex, including on the basis of her gender \nidentity, transgender status, and nonconformity to sex-based stereotypes, in violation of Title IX, \nand on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n2 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 2 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nDefendants’ actions deny Jane Doe #1 full and equal access to MASD’s education programs and \nactivities on the basis of her sex. \n6.  Plaintiff, through her mother and next friend Jane Doe #2, brings this action \nagainst Defendants to obtain redress for these unlawful and discriminatory actions. Absent relief, \nPlaintiff’s injuries will continue to grow. \n7.  Jane Doe #2 has repeatedly advised Defendants that their actions violate Jane Doe \n#1’s right to attend school free from sex discrimination. Despite being put on notice of the \nviolations of Jane Doe #1’s statutory and constitutional rights, MASD refuses to change its \npolicy and practices. It instead continues to prohibit Plaintiff from using the girls’ bathrooms. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3), and is authorized to order declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n9.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District of Wisconsin under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \nbecause the claims arose in the District, the parties reside in the District, and all of the events \ngiving rise to this action occurred in the District. \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1 is an eleven-year-old girl. She resides in Waukesha County, \nWisconsin within the area served by Defendant MASD. Jane Doe #1 is a student at Prairie View \nElementary School, one of MASD’s public elementary schools. She is currently enrolled in \nMASD’s summer school program at Mukwonago High School until July 13, 2023, and she will \nbegin her sixth-grade year at Prairie View in September 2023. \n3 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 3 of 20   Document 1\n\n \n11.  Jane Doe #2 is Jane Doe #1’s mother and brings this action as her next friend. \nJane Doe #2 resides in Waukesha County, Wisconsin within the area served by Defendant \nMASD. \n12.  Defendant Mukwonago Area School District is a public school district located in \nWaukesha County, Wisconsin, serving approximately 5,000 students from kindergarten through \ntwelfth grade. MASD is a recipient of federal funds and, as such, is subject to Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination against any person in any \neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. MASD operates eight \nschools, including six elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school. One of the \nelementary schools is Prairie View, a public elementary school located in North Prairie, \nWisconsin, serving students in grades kindergarten through sixth grade. The high school is \nMukwonago High School, a public high school located in Mukwonago, Wisconsin, serving \nstudents in grades nine through twelve. \n13.  Defendant MASD operates a summer school program for students of varying \ngrades, including elementary school students, at Mukwonago High School. The summer school \nprogram is led or facilitated by MASD staff and administrators. The Board is vicariously liable \nfor the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, representatives, administrators, staff, and \nvolunteers. \n14.  MASD designates responsibility for its administration to its Superintendent. \nDefendant Joe Koch is the Superintendent. He assumed this position in the spring of 2023. At all \ntimes relevant to the events described herein, Defendant Koch acted within the scope of his \nemployment as an employee, agent, and representative of MASD. In such capacity, he carried \nout the discriminatory practices described herein (a) at the direction of, and with the consent, \n4 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 4 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nencouragement, knowledge, and ratification of MASD; (b) under MASD’s authority, control, \nand supervision; and (c) with the actual or apparent authority of MASD. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Jane Doe #1 \n15.  Jane Doe #1 has been a student at Prairie View since she was in third grade. She \nenjoys science and technology at school, and outdoor activities with her family. Jane Doe #1 has \neagerly participated in summer school programming at Mukwonago High School for the past \nthree years, where she enjoys participating in classes like coding for kids and softball. \n16.  Jane Doe #1 is a girl. She is also transgender. She was designated “male” on her \nbirth certificate, but has identified as a girl since toddlerhood. She has presented as a girl at home \nsince the age of three, and at school since first grade. Since then, she has lived as a girl and \nparticipated with girls in school activities when students are separated by gender. She has also \nused the girls’ bathroom at school since she began presenting as a girl at school in first grade. \n17.  Jane Doe #1 has undertaken her gender presentation transition under the guidance \nand care of therapists and medical doctors. She was diagnosed with gender dysphoria by her \nhealth care provider in 2022. She is currently under the care of a child psychiatrist and sees a \ntherapist regularly.  \n18.  During first, second, and the first half of third grade, Jane Doe #1 used the girls’ \nrestroom along with other female students at the elementary school that she attended before \nmoving to Prairie View. No problem arose with her restroom use during this time, whether from \nother students, parents in the district, or school staff. \n19.  When Jane Doe #2 enrolled Jane Doe #1 at Prairie View for the second half of \nthird grade, Jane Doe #2 disclosed Jane Doe #1’s transgender identity to three staff members: the \n5 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 5 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nPrairie View principal, Jane Doe #1’s third-grade classroom teacher, and the Prairie View gym \nteacher. Jane Doe #2 felt that these staff members should know Jane Doe #1’s status as a \ntransgender student so that they could ensure her safety and wellbeing at school. \n20.  Jane Doe #1 voluntarily disclosed her transgender status to other students in her \nclass at the beginning of her fifth grade school year. She did not experience negative responses to \nthis disclosure, and she continued comfortably presenting and participating as a girl at school. \n21.  Until the discriminatory events at issue in this Complaint, Jane Doe #1 felt happy \nand welcomed at school. Her teachers supported her learning and growth. She enjoyed \nfriendships with her classmates. In all respects, she participated as a girl in school, whether \nplaying on the girls’ team in gym class or using the girls’ restroom along with the other female \nstudents at school. \nMASD’s Growing Opposition to Plaintiff’s Access to Restrooms  \nConsistent with Her Gender Identity at the End of the 2022-23 School Year \n \n22.  Around early April 2023, the Prairie View principal reported to Jane Doe #2 that \nthe principal had receiving phone calls from parents of Prairie View students. These parents \nasked the principal questions about Jane Doe #1’s genitals. The principal refused to answer these \ninappropriate questions, but alerted Jane Doe #2 about the calls. \n23.  Jane Doe #2 also learned in or around April 2023 that parents and other residents \nin Waukesha County had created a Facebook group called “Mukwonago Parents for Normal \nEducation.” Members of this group were writing disparaging posts and comments that clearly \nreferred to Jane Doe #1. They described Jane Doe #1 as dangerous. They made accusations that \nJane Doe #1 had exposed her genitals to other children in the bathroom. One group member \nwrote a comment asking if Jane Doe #1’s parents were pedophiles. No evidence was offered in \n6 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 6 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nsupport of these claims, which were so baseless that no investigatory activities were conducted \nby school or other authorities. \n24.  No problems have arisen during the entirety of Jane Doe #1’s use of the girls’ \nbathroom at school since she was in third grade. No teacher, administrator, or other MASD staff \nmember has ever contacted Jane Doe #2 to report that Jane Doe #1 exposed her genitals to other \nstudents in the restroom, nor is there any apparent record of this alleged occurrence. No teacher, \nadministrator, or other MASD staff member has ever reported any complaints from students \nabout Jane Doe #1’s bathroom use at school. \n25.  Jane Doe #2 was shocked and alarmed by the Facebook group. She worried about \nJane Doe #1’s safety at school in the wake of the harmful, inflammatory, and false statements \nwritten by members of the group. \n26.  About a month after these posts and comments appeared on the Facebook group \nand the Prairie View principal began receiving phone calls from parents about Jane Doe #1, the \nMASD, through its elected leadership, i.e., the School Board, involved itself with Jane Doe #1 \nand her bathroom use at school. \n27.  On May 15, 2023, the School Board held a closed executive meeting, attended by \nits attorney, where it discussed Jane Doe #1’s bathroom use. Jane Doe #2 attended part of this \nmeeting. The School Board suggested several options for Jane Doe #1’s bathroom use at the \nmeeting. These suggestions included forcing Jane Doe #1 to use a separate bathroom designated \nsolely for transgender students or a separate, single-occupancy gender-neutral restroom. Any \nrestroom designated for transgender students would be solely used by Jane Doe #1 as the only \ntransgender student at Prairie View (or at least the only transgender student known to school \nadministrators), upon information and belief.  \n7 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 7 of 20   Document 1\n\n \n28.  When Jane Doe #2 expressed her opposition to these two options and told the \nSchool Board that Jane Doe #1 had a right to use the girls’ bathrooms, the School Board told \nJane Doe #2 that it was in a difficult position. The School Board stated that it could either anger \nparents who were opposed to Jane Doe #1’s presence and bathroom use at school if it allowed \nJane Doe #1 to continue using the girls’ bathrooms, or it could be sued by Jane Doe #2 if the \nSchool Board refused to allow Jane Doe #1 to use the girls’ bathrooms.  \n29.  After the initial School Board meeting on May 15, then-Superintendent Shawn \nMcNulty told Jane Doe #1 that the School Board had not reached a decision. Jane Doe #2 was \ntold that, in the interim, Plaintiff could continue using the girls’ bathroom at Prairie View, she \nhad been doing since third grade. \n30.  On May 22, 2023, the School Board held a public meeting. During this meeting, \nmembers of the public spoke against Jane Doe #1 using the girls’ bathrooms and made vitriolic \ncomments towards her, including stating that there was a “boy in the girls’ bathroom.”  \n31.  The School Board did not make a decision on Jane Doe #1’s bathroom use at the \nmeeting on May 22, 2023. However, after the meeting, then-Superintendent McNulty informed \nJane Doe #2 that Jane Doe #1 could continue using the girls’ restroom for the remainder of the \nschool year if she provided a doctor’s note confirming Jane Doe #1’s gender dysphoria \ndiagnosis. Jane Doe #2 complied and sent a note from Jane Doe #1’s doctor with this \nconfirmation the next day. Jane Doe #1 continued using the girls’ bathroom without issue. \n32.  On May 23, 2023, the School Board sent an email to parents and students in the \ndistrict stating that “[t]he School Board of the Mukwonago Area School District affirms its \nposition that students should use the locker rooms and bathrooms of their sex at birth.” The email \n8 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 8 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nstated that the School Board would develop a related policy during the summer of 2023 for \nimplementation in the 2023-24 school year. \n33.  On May 30, 2023, MASD employee Christine Bowden sent Jane Doe #2 a special \neducation and/or Section 504 referral for Jane Doe #1 based on her diagnoses of Attention-\nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and generalized anxiety disorder. Bowden had no \nexplanation for why a special education and/or Section 504 referral were needed or appropriate, \nand Section 504 and other special education services for ADHD and anxiety are wholly unrelated \nto Jane Doe #1’s restroom use as a transgender girl.  \n34.  Although there were no issues resulting from Jane Doe #1’s continued use of the \ngirls’ bathroom at Prairie View Elementary School through the end of the 2022-2023 school \nyear, Jane Doe #1 experienced unprecedented bullying from other students after MASD began \ntargeting her because of her transgender status. Jane Doe #1 experienced episodes of bullying \nbased on her gender identity multiple times each week during the end of the regular school year. \nOther students have continued to bully her for her gender identity during her time in summer \nschool, especially on the bus. On multiple occasions, she has refused to take the bus home from \nschool because of repeat instances of bullying that she has experienced in that setting. This \nbullying has caused Jane Doe #1 significant stress and anxiety.  \nMASD’s Current Refusal to Allow Plaintiff to Use the Girls’ Restroom  \nDuring Summer School at Mukwonago High School \n \n35.  Jane Doe #1 attends MASD’s summer school program at the high school. Before \nprogramming began, Defendant Superintendent Koch sent Jane Doe #2 a letter on June 16, \n2023, stating that Jane Doe #1 was required to use “a gender-neutral or male bathroom” at \nsummer school. The MASD Director of Pupil Services, Christine Bowden, also sent Jane Doe #2 \nan email attaching a map of the high school indicating the location of Jane Doe #1’s summer \n9 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 9 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nschool classrooms and the location of the “gender-neutral” single-occupancy restrooms in the \nadministration office and the health room. \n36.  Jane Doe #1’s classes are mostly situated on the second floor of the building, \nwhile the gender-neutral restrooms are situated a significant distance away on the first floor of \nthe building. In contrast, the girls’ bathrooms are situated across the hall or around the corner \nfrom Jane Doe #1’s classes on the second floor.  \n37.  The purportedly “gender-neutral” single-occupancy restrooms in the \nadministration office are, in fact, labeled by gender. These restrooms are typically used by staff \nmembers, and they are separately labeled male and female. MASD staff have directed Jane Doe \n#1 to use only the men’s single-occupancy restroom, which is otherwise used only by adult male \nadministrators. The other purportedly gender-neutral single-occupancy restroom is located in the \nhealth office, and is otherwise used only by students who are sick or visiting the school nurse. \n38.  Despite the instructions from MASD administrators, Jane Doe #1 initially used \nthe girls’ bathroom during the first few days of summer school, as she had for her three years at \nPrairie View and her previous two years at summer school in the school district.  \n39.  Jane Doe #1 does not feel comfortable using the boys’ restroom in general, nor at \nsummer school. Jane Doe #1 identifies as a girl and feels deeply distressed at the idea of using \nthe boys’ restroom. Using the boys’ restroom is at odds with Jane Doe #1’s female identity and \nher public presentation as a girl. She is anxious that using the boys’ bathroom would convey to \nher peers that she should be viewed and treated as a boy. Moreover, the boys’ restrooms in \nMukwonago High School are unsupervised and open to all students present during summer \nschool. As a transgender eleven-year-old girl, Jane Doe #1 is afraid of encountering male \nstudents in these restrooms, including older high school boys. MASD has not acknowledged this \n10 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 10 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nrisk to Jane Doe #1’s safety and wellbeing in its staff’s communications with Jane Doe #2, nor in \nthe correspondence described below in paragraph 48. \n40.  Jane Doe #1 also does not feel comfortable using the single-occupancy restrooms \nin the administration office and the health room. The administration restrooms are typically used \nby teachers, not students. It is Jane Doe #1’s understanding that she would be the only student \nallowed—in her case, required—to use these restrooms. The health office restroom is used only \nby students who are visiting the nurse, and using that restroom would expose her to illness and \nthe scrutiny of other students. Additionally, these restrooms are located on a different floor from \nmost of Jane Doe #1’s summer school classes. She fears being asked by other students why she \nis using that restroom rather than the girls’ bathroom; the time and inconvenience of traveling the \nlonger distance to the restroom and the potential for missing class due to the longer travel time; \nand the stigmatizing, isolating nature of being forced to use a segregated bathroom apart from \nevery other classmate. \n41.  Shortly after summer school began on June 19, 2023, MASD staff began \nmonitoring Jane Doe #1’s bathroom use. On June 22, 2023, Christine Bowden sent an email to \nJane Doe #2 notifying her that Jane Doe #1 had used the “female restroom” at summer school \nthe day before, in violation of the requirement listed in Defendant Superintendent Koch’s June \n16 letter. Likewise, the summer school principal told Jane Doe #1 on June 22, 2023 that she must \nuse the gender-neutral bathroom on the first floor.  \n42.  MASD staff then took Plaintiff on a “tour” of the boys’ and gender-neutral \nrestrooms. This interaction caused Jane Doe #1 to become distressed, and she advised the school \nsocial worker, Alexis Schultz, that she was experiencing thoughts of depression and self-harm.  \n11 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 11 of 20   Document 1\n\n \n43.  Despite Jane Doe #1’s significant distress at the prospect of using the boys’ \nrestroom or single-occupancy restrooms on the first floor, MASD staff continued to monitor Jane \nDoe #1’s restroom use, and to tell her that she was required to use those restrooms instead of the \ngirls’ restroom. \n44.  On June 26, 2023, MASD adopted a new restroom policy for the district, “Policy \n5514.” It requires that, “except as otherwise required by law,” students use “restrooms and locker \nroom facilities on District property and at District-sponsored events according to each student’s \noriginal sex assigned at birth.” Policy 5514 states that any requests for exceptions or \naccommodations to the policy “shall be considered by a team of District staff on a case-by-case \nbasis in consultation with the student, the student’s parents, the Director of Student Services, the \nschool psychologist, the school counselor, the classroom teacher, the building principal, and any \nother individuals the District deems appropriate.” It further states that “[a]ll decisions related to \nsuch requests will take into consideration the safety and privacy of all students.” \n45.  Policy 5514 also states that “Accommodations for a diagnosis of gender \ndysphoria shall be addressed in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \nand the District's corresponding procedures for developing Section 504 Plans.” Neither Policy \n5514 nor any communications from MASD to Jane Doe #2 explain how or why the district is \nattempting to apply Section 504 to Jane Doe #1’s and other students’ rights to use restrooms at \nschool that match their gender identities.   \n46.  Policy 5514 is illegal. It attempts to force Jane Doe #1 into an impossible choice \nwhereby she must choose between using the boys’ restroom, which is extremely uncomfortable \nto her and does not conform with her gender identity, or an isolating and stigmatizing restroom \n12 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 12 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nthat singles her out as the only transgender student at Prairie View or in summer school, subject \nto different rules and treatment. \n47.  On June 27, 2023, undersigned counsel sent a letter to Defendant Superintendent \nKoch explaining how MASD is violating Plaintiff’s rights and demanding that MASD permit her \nto use the girls’ restroom at summer school and in the fall when the regular school year begins. \n48.  On June 28, 2023, counsel for MASD sent a response. The letter was largely non-\nresponsive, focusing inexplicably on unrelated questions about special education instead of sex \ndiscrimination. It did make plain, however, that Defendants reject the proposition that they are \nrequired by law to permit Jane Doe #1 to use the girls’ restrooms —despite having been provided \na copy of Jane Doe #1’s gender dysphoria notice, there having been no issues over the past three \nyears during which she has used the girls’ restrooms, and being aware that the current prohibition \nagainst her use of the girls’ restrooms is causing her to experience depression and thoughts of \nself-harm. Defendants’ position is directly contradicted by controlling law, specifically Whitaker \nex. rel. Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist., No. 1 Bd. Of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. \n2017). \n49.  Since the passage of Policy 5514, MASD summer school staff have continued to \ntell Jane Doe #1 that she cannot use the girls’ bathroom and that she must use either the boys’ \nrestroom or the single-occupancy restrooms. \n50.  On June 28, 2023, Defendants’ summer school staff again intervened after Jane \nDoe #1 used the girls’ bathroom at Mukwonago High School. MASD employee Alexis \nMcCarthy interrupted Jane Doe #1 as a class was beginning and brought her downstairs to the \nSpecial Education office on the first floor. Once there, MASD employee Benjamin Kossow told \n13 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 13 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nJane Doe #1 that she may not use the girls’ bathroom and that she was in violation of the School \nBoard’s policy. \n51.  Jane Doe #1 became extremely upset that she had been pulled out of class and \ntargeted once again for her bathroom use, and she told Kossow that she wanted to go home. \nSubsequently, McCarthy and Kossow called Jane Doe #2 to inform her that Jane Doe #1 had \nviolated MASD’s bathroom policy. Jane Doe #2 asked if Jane Doe #1 was in trouble, and \nKossow told her that Jane Doe #1 would be disciplined if she continued to use the girls’ \nrestroom. \n52.  On June 29, 2023, Jane Doe #1 was again pulled out of class by MASD staff after \nshe was seen using the girls’ restroom and told that she was in violation of the School Board’s \npolicy and that further use of the girls’ restroom would result in disciplinary action. \n53.  Based on the statements and actions of MASD officials, Jane Doe #1 feels deep \nanxiety about continuing to attend summer school, as well as returning to Prairie View \nElementary School in the fall. \nINJURY TO PLAINTIFF \n54.  Through their actions described above, Defendants have injured and are \ncontinuing to injure Plaintiff. \n55.  Defendants have denied Jane Doe #1 full and equal access to MASD’s education \nprograms and activities by denying her the full and equal access to student restrooms.     \n56.  Jane Doe #1 has experienced, and continues to experience, the harmful effects of \nbeing targeted for her transgender status and being prohibited from using the girls’ bathrooms \nthat she has used without issue for nearly three years at Prairie View, and during two previous \nsummer school sessions at Mukwonago High School. She has experienced thoughts of self-harm \n14 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 14 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nwhen MASD administrators have told her that she cannot use the girls’ bathroom at summer \nschool. She is experiencing depression, anxiety, embarrassment, and stigma. \n57.  When school administrators and staff instruct Jane Doe #1 not to use the girls’ \nrestrooms and otherwise undermine her female identity and single her out as different from all \nother girls—as they continue to do—she feels deeply hurt, disrespected, and humiliated.   \n58.  As a direct and continuing result of Defendants’ discriminatory actions, Jane Doe \n#1 has suffered increased and continuing emotional distress. She has experienced increased \nanxiety, thoughts of self-harm, and fear as a result of the discrimination she is experiencing at \nschool.  \n59.  If Defendants refuse to grant Jane Doe #1 access to girls’ restrooms for the \nremainder of summer school and for the upcoming 2023-2024 school year, she will likely \nexperience a greater level of social stigma, emotional distress, academic harm, and impediments \nto her gender identity. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \nViolation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. \n \n60.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates the facts and allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 59 as fully set forth herein. \n61.  Under Title IX and its implementing regulations, “[n]o person in the United States \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); see also 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (Department of Education Title IX \nregulations); 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31 (Department of Agriculture Title IX regulations); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 86.31 (Department of Health and Human Services Title IX regulations). Title IX’s prohibitions \n15 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 15 of 20   Document 1\n\n \non sex discrimination extend to “any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, \nor other education program or activity operated by a recipient” of federal funding. 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.31; 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31; 45 C.F.R. § 86.31. \n62.  Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” encompasses \ndiscrimination based on an individual’s gender identity, transgender status, and gender \nexpression, including nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes. \n63.  Conduct specifically prohibited under Title IX includes, inter alia, treating one \nperson differently from another in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or \ncondition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or service; providing different aid, benefits, or \nservices in a different manner; denying any person any such aid, benefit, or service; or otherwise \nsubjecting any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment. 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.31; 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31; 45 C.F.R. § 86.31. \n64.  As a federal funding recipient, Defendant MASD, including the academic, \nextracurricular, and other educational opportunities that it provides through Prairie View \nElementary School and Mukwonago High School, is subject to Title IX’s prohibitions on sex- \nand gender-based discrimination against any student. \n65.  Defendants, by adopting and enforcing a policy or practice of prohibiting \nPlaintiff, a transgender girl, from accessing female-designated restrooms at school, and requiring \nthat she use male-designated restrooms or single-occupancy restrooms, have discriminated and \ncontinue to discriminate against Plaintiff in her enjoyment of MASD’s educational programs and \nactivities by treating her differently from other female students based on her gender identity, the \nfact that she is transgender, and her nonconformity to female stereotypes, thereby denying her \n16 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 16 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nthe full and equal participation in, benefits of, and right to be free from discrimination in the \neducational opportunities offered by MASD on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX. \n66.  Defendants, through instructing MASD staff to report Jane Doe #1’s use of the \ngirls’ restroom, operates an unlawful policy or practice of profiling Plaintiff and other students \nwho are transgender and/or do not conform to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, and thereby \ndeprive Plaintiff and similarly situated students of their rights under Title IX to be free from \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex, including on the basis of gender identity, transgender status, \nand nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, in further violation of Title IX. \n67.  Plaintiff has been, and continues to be, injured by Defendants’ discriminatory \nconduct and has suffered damages as a result. \nSecond Cause of Action \nViolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Based on Deprivation of Plaintiff’s Rights under the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n68.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporate the facts and allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1 through 59 as fully set forth herein. \n69.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, discrimination based on sex, including gender, gender identity, transgender \nstatus, and nonconformity to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, as well as discrimination based on \ntransgender status alone, is presumptively unconstitutional and is therefore subject to heightened \nscrutiny. \n70.  Defendants, by adopting and enforcing a policy or practice of prohibiting \nPlaintiff, a transgender girl, from accessing female-designated restrooms at school, and requiring \nthat she use male-designated restrooms or single-occupancy restrooms, have discriminated and \ncontinue to discriminate against Plaintiff in her enjoyment of MASD’s educational programs and \n17 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 17 of 20   Document 1\n\n \nactivities by treating her differently from other female students based on her gender identity, the \nfact that she is transgender, and her nonconformity to female stereotypes, thereby denying her \nthe full and equal participation in, benefits of, and right to be free from discrimination in the \neducational opportunities offered by MASD through Prairie View Elementary School and \nMukwonago High School on the basis of sex and transgender status, in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause. \n71.  Defendants, through instructing MASD staff to report Jane Doe #1’s use of the \ngirls’ restroom, operates an unlawful policy or practice of profiling Plaintiff and other students \nwho are transgender and/or do not conform to sex- or gender-based stereotypes, and thereby \ndeprive Plaintiff and similarly situated students of their rights to be free from discrimination on \nthe basis of sex, including on the basis of gender identity, transgender status, and nonconformity \nto sex- or gender-based stereotypes, in further violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n72.  Defendants’ discrimination against Jane Doe #1 is not substantially related to any \nimportant governmental interest, nor is it rationally related to any legitimate governmental \ninterest. \n73.  Defendants are liable for their violation of Jane Doe #1’s Fourteenth Amendment \nrights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n74.  Plaintiff has been, and continues to be, injured by Defendants’ conduct and has \nsuffered damages as a result. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, by and through her mother and next friend, Jane \nDoe #2, requests that this Court: \n18 \n \nCase 2:23-cv-00876-LA   Filed 06/30/23   Page 18 of 20   Document 1\n\n \n(a)  Enter a declaratory judgment that the actions of Defendants complained of herein \nare in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. and \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n(b)  Enter a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction, and all other \naffirmative relief necessary, enjoining Defendants and their affiliates, agents, employees, and \nrepresentatives from continuing the illegal conduct described above, and further directing \nDefendants to remedy the effects of their illegal, discriminatory conduct alleged in this \nComplaint and to prevent similar occurrences in the future.
